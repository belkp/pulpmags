Ten years we have fought, up-hill and down, amid execration and applause, steadily onward and forward. We are today a great organization, with all the pitfalls and temptations of size and strength. One thing alone will keep and guide us to vaster size and irresistible power: the human touch—the personal acquaintanceship, the cordial sympathy of those who meet face to face and put hand in hand. Our danger, is space. We stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific ?nd from the St. Lawrence to the Panama Canal. Let us continually get together. Let us be ever meeting and meeting again, knowing each other, getting the inspiration of personal contact in local and state meetings, in regional conferences, in national conferences, like this great Cleveland meeting. There is Strength in Unity, but in Knowledge there is Freedom. OUR SUCCESS AND FAILURE THE facts are these: We fought and worked on the Western Front, 200,000 strong under a thousand black officers; we helped to crush the most serious obstacle to the modern democratic movement since Napoleon Bonaparte; we gained the sympathy and respect of France and the civilized world—and what is more important, we gained a new self-respect and a new consciousness of power. Despite all this great success, we made one serious blunder and lest in the future we repeat this mistake, let us look it now full in the face and seek to understand it: During the draft and the period of cantonment training the whole conscience and intelligence of the race stood on the firing line; we relentlessly discovered, exposed and fought discrimination. We did not wholly remove it, but we did overcome much and, above all, we knew the essential facts. We suffered with open eyes. Mr. Emmett J. Scott, as Special Assistant to the Secretary of War, became gradually our mouthpiece for complaint and intermediary for redress. It was difficult work. Considering the discriminations of the draft law, the prejudice of the South and North and the Espionage Act, Mr. Scott seemed to be doing as well as anyone could expect under the circumstances. TH E CRISIS noted this, gave him every public and private aid and thanked him for his efforts. Mr. Scott several times expressed similar appreciation and once wrote the editor, on the occasion of the proposed special bureau in the War Department, as follows: Dear Dr. DuBois: Except for the fact that for the past few weeks I have been unusually hard-pressed for time, I should have sooner written you regarding a number of matters. I am writing now particularly to express my personal regret) that the Sub-Section of the M. I. B., which THE CRISIS Major Spingarn has advocated, is not to be organized and that the Government is not to have, in that particular section, the benefit of your counsel and advice. To me it has been strange indeed', as well as very disappointing, to note the false interpretations that have been placed upon Major Spingarn's offer to you, as well as upon certain of your recent editorial expressions. I sincerely regret the unfortunate and unjust attitude taken by so many of our friends with reference to the matters of your coming to Washington and what I consider your sensible and patriotic utterances. It seems to me inconceivable how any sane, true-hearted American could take exception to your expressions of loyalty to the Government at a time like this. It is equally inconceivable that any fair-minded person could misconstrue such patriotic expressions as you have been making during this period of national emergency and need. With all good wishes, I am, as ever, Sincerely yours, (Signed) EMMETT J. SCOTT, Special Assistant, Office of the Secretary of War. On December 1, the editor of THE CRISIS went to France. Within a month after landing he was utterly amazed and dumbfounded at the revelations poured upon him. He heard of conditions, acts, conspiracies, wholesale oppression and cruelty of which he had had no previous inkling. He did not expect to find that the black soldiers had been altogether happy. War is war. The soldier, black or white, must endure cold and heat, rain and mud, hunger and hurt. Moreover, the editor knew that the colored soldier in addition to all this would feel the sting of prejudice and discrimination. But the editor of THE CRISIS and, we are persuaded, not one other American Negro in a million knew or dreamed of conditions like this: 1.	 Wholesale dismissal and transfer of Negro officers regardless of merit. 2.	 Wide and continuous distribution of printed and spoken propaganda against an "inferior" race. 3.	 Open reiteration of unfounded charges of cowardice and infamous crime. 4.	 Deliberate attempts to discourage morale, withhold equipment and put unequipped units into battle. 5.	 Mistreating, overworking and almost enslaving many of the stevedore laborers. 6.	 Dismissing and demoting white officers who refused to join the anti-Negro campaign. 7.	 Organizing one of the bitterest and most stinging campaigns of personal affront and insult ever attempted in a civilized land against civilized people. For four long months story after story and document after document poured into the editor's hands substantiating the above charges. For four months the editor was helpless. Every step he took was heralded by the Intelligence Service of the American Expeditionary Force, as follows: HEADQUARTERS, NINETY-SECOND DI VISION, AMERICAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCES, A. P. 0, 766 1 January. 1919. SECRET EMO: To Intelligence Officers— 1. A man by name of DuBois, with visitor's pass, reported on his way to visit this Division. His presence at station of any unit will be immediately reported in secret enclosure to OPINION 	129 Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, these headquarters. Likewise, prompt report will be made to G-2 of all his moves and actions while at station of any unit. 2. The fact of this inquiry as to DttBois and his moves will not be disclosed to any person outside the Intelligence Service. By	 command of Brigadier-General ERWIN. F. P. SCHOONMAKER, Major, General Staff, A. C. of S., G-2. He was compelled to sign the following pledge as to his correspondence with America: " To avoid criticism of all Allied Forces; to avoid any observation tending to aid the enemy or to injure morale of the Allies, and not to publish any written, statements, or give out any interviews, except through the censorship of the Intelligence Section of the General Staff." He landed in America, March 31 , and in the ensuing issue of TH E CRISIS he felt it his duty to ask Mr. Scott, our special representative in the War Department, three simple questions of fact. THE CRISIS dislikes and avoids personal controversy. THE CRISIS knows that it is easier to criticise than to do. THE CRISIS is eager to give Mr. Scott every credit due and to make every allowance for the singular difficulty of his position. But THE CRISIS in its position as public mentor and adviser and newspaper absolutely refuses to be turned one moment from its determination to know why it was that in this the most critical period of the existence of the Negro race, 200,000 of the best blood of our young manhood—men who offered their lives for their people and their country, could be crucified, insulted, de graded and maltreated while their fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers had no adequate knowledge of the real truth. It is not simply a question of what Mr. Scott personally could or could not accomplish—God knows we are all of us helpless enough in this bitter fight—it is the vaster question of the right of concealing fatal knowledge; if Mr. Scott could do nothing, how did he know that others were equally helpless? How did he know that all of us together would be equally helpless? Why could he not have reassembled the editor's conference or even some larger meeting of influential men and said to them in confidence: "Hell is loose in France, and our boys are dying in soul and body—what can be done?" If he could not act publicly, could he not have passed the word quietly to his friends ? Was his only recourse silence and the repeated assurance to inquiry that everything was going well? Suppose we discovered that some colored official was concealing the knowledge of lynchings on the ground that he could not stop them; shall we not try the power of every one—the vast, combined power of all before we surrender? No concealment is ever a cure for crime. Did Mr. Scott's position depend on his not revealing the desperate conditions in France? We do not believe it. We believe that Secretary Baker would have halted the anti-Negro campaign had he known its lengths. We believe that the colored press, even with the limitations of the Espionage Law, could have worked up a public opinion that would have brought Greer and his compeers home; and even granted that absolutely nothing could have been done, we ought at least to have known the truth. But it is not true that nothing could THE CRISIS have been done. The same campaign was started against colored workers in the Y. M. C. A. in France; a whole batch of the best was summarily dismissed and ordered home; but a colored inspector was put on the job, and in a month matters were changed —Bullock, Mrs. Curtis and others, who had been denounced as "Bolsheviki" because they stood up for Negro rights, were returned to their work and are yet in France—honored, trusted, hardworking officials. The sending of Ralph Tyler finally as newspaper correspondent was an excellent move, but it came too late and, indeed, unless Mr. Tyler had special facilities accorded him, he could send nothing essential past the censor. He had no special facilities and he sent nothing. But that was not all. Despite the fact' that Mr. Tyler had the same opportunities as the editor of THE CRISIS to learn the truth, he has since his return published practically nothing and revealed no essential fact. Why? THE CRISIS, therefore, leaves the matter precisely in the position that it was before: 1.	 Did Mr. Scott know the treatment which black troops were receiving in France ? 2.	 If Mr. Scott did not know, why did he not find out? 3.	 If he did know, what did he do about it? RECONSTRUCTION THIS is a program of reconstruction within the Negro race in America, after the revolution of world war. In Education we must take up the problem of the colored child in the white school. At present the tendency is to accept and even demand separate schools because our children so often are neglected, mistreated and humiliated in the public schools. This is a dangerous and inadvisable alternative and a wicked surrender of principle for which our descendants will pay dearly. Our policy should be to form in connection with each school and district effective Parents' Associations, composed of the fathers, mothers and friends of colored pupils; these associations should establish friendly relations with teachers and school authorities, urge parents to wash and dress their children properly, help, look after truancy and poverty, arrange for home work and tuition for the backward, curb delinquency and be, in fine, a vigilance committee to keep the public school open to all and fit the Negro child for it. In Religion we must, in the larger cities, stop building and purchasing new church edifices and begin to invest the money of the church in homes, land and business, and philanthropic enterprises for the benefit of the people. Individual home ownership in most large cities is today difficult; but a group of people who can buy and pay for a hundred thousand dollar church can purchase a hundred thousand dollar apartment house and run it. It is a simple business proposition and requires only elementary honesty and ordinary executive ability. Churches can easily begin co-operative buying of coal, bread and meat, using their own premises for distribution; churches in the country and small towns can buy farms and rent or run them; the church can purchase automobile trucks and help the Negro farmer market his produce independent of the railroads and thieving commission merchants; even simple manufacturing, sewing and building are not beyond the reasonable activities of church bodies. Indeed, unless the church extends its economic functions beyond the simple program of building bigger and finer edifices—unless it organizes the Negro laborer so that OPINION 131 his entire wage will not go in rent and supporting storekeepers who despise and cheat him—unless it thus helps the laborer, it will lose the laborer. The hope of the Negro church is character-building through economic co-operation. In Business the Negro must branch out into certain new lines where he has long and foolishly hesitated: We must open drygoods and haberdashery shops, meat markets and clothing stores, shoe stores and hat stores. We must gradually but persistently get into manufacturing. The deft fingers of our young people are as easily adapted to machinery as the fingers of whites. We are denied opportunity by white trade unions and by lack of pioneering courage among colored capitalists and business men. Let us wake up. The era of manufactures in the United States is just begun. The expansion of domestic and foreign trade is going to be enormous. We raise the cotton—why not spin and weave it? We dig the iron —why not weld it? We mine the coal—why not turn it to steam and power? Do we lack brains and cap ital? No, we lack experience and courage. Get them. In Politics the colored woman is going to vote. This is our chance. Away with the old regime, the pothouse politician and white bribery. Let us form clubs and study government in city, county, state and nation. Let us know the law and the officials and their duties. Let us keep continual and rigid tabs on every candidate. Away with parties—what we want is men. Away with promises—what we want is deeds. Study, learn, register and vote. Vote at every election and see that every friend of yours votes. Pay your poll taxes and register. .Do not vote for a party. Never vote a straight ticket. Vote for men and measures—not for parties. But above all, vote! Let every Negro man and woman, always and everywhere, vote. A GREAT WOMAN IT is given to few persons to transform a people in a gen eration. Yet this was done by the late Madame C. J. Walker. She found a folk who for generations had neglected the hygiene of the hair. They did not usually wash and cleanse it regularly, they did not give it light and air, they did not comb and brush it sufficiently, they did not stimulate and keep healthy the scalp. Madame Walker came with a homely recipe: thorough and periodic cleansing of the scalp and hair, careful drying and oiling and dressing with hot "curling" irons. The latter part of the method—the least important or necessary—was at first seized upon by black and white as the subject of much merriment and many jokes. Negroes were said to be "straightening" their hair in order to imitate white folk. This led to some modifications of the methods used, leaving more of the natural curl in the hair and using less oil. The essential part, cleansing and brushing, remained and it is not too much to say that this revolutionized the personal habits and appearance of millions of human beings. Madame Walker made and deserved a fortune and gave much of it away generously. She deserved well of the world, and may her rest be Peace. THE TERCENTENARY TERCENTENARY celebrations are in full swing throughout the United States, and others are being planned. Th e largest single celebration is that of the M. E. Church, in Columbus, Ohio, held primarily to celebrate one hundred years of Methodism. Persons and churches interested in programs for the month of August may write to the Editor of THE CRISIS.

FOUNTAIN Jr.,Northwestern  JR.          138 National Association for The Advancement of Colored People. RECRUITING IN THE MID-WEST R. W. BAGNALL, District Organizer THE Middle West is the center of much of our industrial life; therefore, when the scarcity of labor caused the factory manager to seek in the Negro the only available supply, hosts of colored people flocked to the Middle West. Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, Dayton, Akron, Youngstown and many of the smaller factory and mill towns found that their Negro population had remarkably increased almost overnight. Many towns, such as Albion, Mich., where a Negro had been more or less of a curiosity, found themselves all at once with a considerable group of black Americans. The first reaction was generally one of hostility, but soon they found that these new-comers were largely decent citizens. The story of how the Negro migrant made good is well known. Wherever he has had half a chance, he has made himself acceptable to the community. Of course, problems arose and still arise; problems of adjustment to a new environment, problems of the relationship of these newcomers to the old Negro citizens, problems of housing, problems of dress and behaviour, problems of thrift and of the increase of prejudice with the increase in numbers. The migrant found that the North was not entirely the Paradise he dreamed, and the necessity of organization became apparent to him, his fellows, and to the social-minded whites. Two organizations have very efficiently served his needs, along with others, the Urban League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Each of these complements the other. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, being a mass organization, makes a strong appeal to the Negro migrant, as well as to his brother of longer residence in the North. This is indicated by requests for organization piling in from small towns all over the Middle West, and from some places where one is surprised to find that the Negro has penetrated in any numbers. Ohio has twenty-one branches, and most of them are wideawake. Small towns, like Urbana, where the Negro population earns its living by working on adjacent farms, as well as factory towns, like Akron, have their enthusiastic branches. In Michigan, we have established enthusiastic branches in Ypsilanti, Flint, Kalamazoo, Jackson, Grand Rapids, Bay City, Benton Harbor and Lansing. We have invaded Canada by establishing a branch in Windsor, Ontario. Hamtramck, Pontiac, Albion, Battle Creek, Saginaw, Ann Arbor and Sault Ste. Marie are taking the preliminary steps toward establishing branches, and some are hoping to be enrolled before the June Conference. South Bend, Ind., is also looking forward to the same end. Out in Wisconsin, we have established a fine branch in Milwaukee, and we are expecting to organize one in Madison. These branches are reaching out and getting the best white citizens in membership. Many of the mayors, coun-. cilmen, prosecuting attorneys, sheriffs, judges, and leading wealthy citizens ara earnest members. These branches are influencing the sentiment of their communities to a striking degree. On the streets of one city in this region, where we have a strong branch,overheard two white men discussing the Negro. "It's no use trying to keep the Negro down," said one, "for he is learning to organize. They have some sort of a National Advancing Society and they belong to it all over this country." To illustrate how the Negro of the Middle West takes to the N. A. A. C. P., the writer established a branch in one of the Michigan towns with a population of 500 Negroes, 100 of whom came in as charter members—onefifth of the Negro population. At another place eighty-nine Negroes became members of the Association as the result of a speech. Our new branches have vision. It is delightful to see a divided, apathetic community come to a sense of social consciousness through the unifying influence of the National Association. In Ypsilanti, Mich., there had existed a colored school for forty years. All Negro children attended this school to the sixth grade. The building was most unsanitary and its equipment inferior. Recently a bond issue was proposed and most of the Negro voters were disposed to favor it, for it was to provide a $40,000 Negro school. The fact that this school was to include all the grades of the grammar school and eventually of the high school, making segregation in education complete, did not seem to affect them. For forty years the whites had imposed a Negro school on them, and it was useless and vain to rebel. The writer invited himself to a meeting held to discuss the bond issue and took with him a brilliant young attorney of Detroit, Charles H. Mahoney, who is intensely interested in his people. The two of us tried with all our might to get them to vote down the bond issue, to organize a branch of the Association, and to take the case of a separate school into court. Mr. Mahoney offered his services as attorney free of charge. We thought that we had failed, but not only did they vote down the bond issue, but they requested the District Organizer to come and establish a branch of the Association, and the first thing the branch did was to accept Mr. Mahoney's offer. A short while ago, the case was tried and Mr. Mahoney's clients were awarded the decision that this Negro school was both unsanitary and illegal and must be closed as such. It was my pleasure to be present a few nights later when this branch presented Mr. Mahoney with a parse of eighty-five dollars in appreciation of his services. In Ohio, a copy of the New York Civil Rights Bill was Introduced in the legislature. We called a conference of the Ohio branches and an efficient lobby was organized. Telegrams and petitions were sent from the colored people all over the state, and the bill was passed by an overwhelming vote in the House and went to the second readng in the Senate. At this juncture, the opposition became aroused, and the sponsor of the bill, the lone colored representative of Ohio, disappeared for a while. When at length found at his home in Cincinnati, he stated that he had been taken ill. While he was absent, the bill was recalled for reconsideration, and when it came again to the vote, was lost. Ohio has a civil rights law, but it is greatly inferior to fhe proposed one. The Ohio branches, however, learned the benefit of state organization while working for this bill, and are eager for a permanent state conference. In Michigan, the writer thought the time opportune for the introduction of the New York bill as the old civil rights law of Michigan was inadequate. Being instructed by the Detroit branch to get this bill offered in the legislature, he placed it in the hands of Senator Condon and Representative Copley, both from Detroit. These men introduced it simultaneously in the House and Senate. On the night before the bill was introduced we organized the splendid Lansing branch, and this branch through the leadership of its efficient president, Mr. Charles Campbell, with the assistance of Mr. Hesper Jackson, who is secretary, acted as a lobby and kept us apprised of every step of progress in the matter. We succeeded in getting every branch in the state and many lodges, churches and clubs to send telegrams and petitions to their senators and representatives. In the judiciary committee of the Senate, the bill, in spite of our efforts, was badly slashed through the influence of Senator Brennon, of Detroit, who is, we understand, identified with large restaurant interests. It was finally reported out with recommendation for passage, and passed the Senate by unanimou" vote of all present. After considerable delay it was reported out of the judiciary committee of the House, but tabled on the objection of a member from Mackinac Island, who felt that his constituents would not stand for Indians eating in their restaurants. Rumor reached us that the bill was to be allowed to lie on the table until the House adjourned, and that if it did come to vote, the Wayne county delegation would vote against it. We sent out a press-story and news-letter, pointing out why the bill should pass and reminding the Wayne delegation that 30,000 Negro voters were holding them accountable for the pas N. A. A. C. P.   141 sage of the bill, and that our Association would do everything in its power to inform these voters as to their action. We also had every Wayne member called up by long distance and urged to bring the bill to vote and to vote for it. One representative told me that he received twelve long distance messages from Detroit urging him to vote for the bill. The bill was immediately called to vote, and was passed by a vote of 67 to 6. Three of those who voted against the bill were from Detroit, one from the district in which Flint is located and the other two from the northern part of the state. We are doing all in our power to rivet their names in the memories of our people. The bill has now been signed by Governor Sleeper. The bill could not have passed without the help of the Lansing branch, to which too much praise cannot be accorded. The bill is not ideal, but it is clearer, more specific and more inclusive than the old law. The civil award to the aggrieved party was declared unconstitutional in Michigan, and so was dropped. We are not wholly satisfied as to the accuracy of this finding. The branches in Michigan learned the benefit of united action in their effort to pass the bill, and are planning a state conference for permanent concerted action in state affairs. They also intend to get the bill made stronger at the next session of the legislature. Here is the bill as passed: A BILL To amend Sections one and two of Act No. 130 of the Public Acts of 1885, entitled "An Act to Protect All Citizens in Their Civil Rights," the same being com-piler Sections 15570 and 15571 of the Corn-piled Laws of 1915. The Peqple of the State of MAohigan enact: Section 1. All persons within the jurisdiction of this state s%all be entitled to full and equal accommodations, advantages, acilities and privileges of inns, restaurants, eating houses, barber shops, public conveyances on land and water, theaters, motion picture houses and all other places of public accommodation, amusement and recreation and all public educational institutions of the state subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law and applicable alike and to all citizens. Section 2. Any person being an owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent, agent or employee of any such place who shall directly or indirectly refuse, withhold from or deny to any person any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges thereof or directly or indirectly publish, circulate, issue, display, post or mail any written or printed communication, notice or advertisement to the effect that any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of any such places shall be refused, withheld from or denied to any person on account of race, creed or color or that any particular race, creed or color is not welcome, objectionable or not acceptable, desired or solicited shall for every suchoffense be deemed guilty of a misdemeanorand upon conviction thereof shall be fined not less than fifteen dollars or more than one hundred dollars or shall be imprisoned in the county jail for not more than ninety days, or both, such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court. THE ATLANTA BRANCH In the June CRISIS the work of the Atlanta Branch was reported with the name of the President, Rev. A. D. Williams, omitted. This mistake was due to the office having received word that the president had resigned to go to Detroit, and not having heard of his return to Atlanta. We are glad, however, to learn that his presidency was kept open and that he is active again in the Branch. It was he who reorganized the work in June, 1918, and brought up the membership to 1,400 in six months. Then he went North, but returned after two months to find a membership of 1 600, which has now become over 2,400. The Rev. Mr. Williams has been active on all committees in planning the registration campaign. He is one of those alert, wide-awake presidents that every Branch needs. His return to Atlanta and resumption of his duties of the presidency has been of great help to the N. A. A. C. P. work. We hope that all readers of the June CRISIS will add hte name to the list of able men and women who have begun the long battle to make Atlanta "safe for democracy." The Rev. Mr. Williams is ono of Atlanta's delegates to the Cleveland Conference. DARKEST MISSISSIPPI AN  N. A . A . C. P. INVESTIGATION DEAN WILLIAM PICKENS has said that it takes courage for a Negro to live in Mississippi. This is strictly true, especially of the Delta and of those parts of Louisiana and Arkansas adjacent to the Delta. The Northerner's first thought upon entering this territory for the first time is that he has gone from civilization to a frontier. It is not only because so many citizens carry guns—and use them—or because political thought is fifty years behind the rest of the world, or because archaic ideas of gentility and "manners" take the place of the wide-awake intelligence which one expects of Americans that this part of the South resembles a frontier. A frontier is a region not yet fully civilized and, therefore, not fully penetrated with the concept that the law is impersonal, a standard to be administered impartially by persons designated for that purpose. A frontier is a place where people take the law inio their own hands, where there are feuds, where crimas are avenged by the individual instead of being dealt with by the community, with the community's safety and best interests in mind. This is what is in the Northerner's mind when he declares that the Mississippi Delta, Arkansas and parts of Louisiana constitute a frontier. For on the merest suspicion of crime, without trial by jury or any other trial, human beings in those states are subject to murder by armed bands of citizens hastily formed into mobs. And the mobs execute their missions with a cold-blooded lust of cruelty, of which Indians in war paint or the lowest type of aboriginal savage might well have been envious. Many iases of m;b murder are accompanied by acts of fiendish torture and, what is most strange to the visitor from northern civilization, the southern women, in whose name the barbarities are committed, frequently witness and applaud them. The mob murders, which prevail and are accepted as commonplace throughout the South, especially in the Mississippi Delta, Louisiana and Arkansas, are what most forcibly impress the Northerner that he is in a land not yet completely civilized- But there are other aspects of that part of the South which fill the visitor with astonishment. Most important of these is the treatment of colored people. They are constantly subject to insult and injury of every sort, without the slightest opportunity for obtaining redress from the courts. Public opinion seems to be indifferent to what happens to "niggers," as they are called, unless the treatment has been so bad that colored people leave the section and a labor shortage is threatened. Colored men, women and children, besides the quotidian humiliation to which they are exposed in "Jim-Crow" cars and waiting-rooms on the railroads, in exclusion from Pullman cars, sleeping accommodations on railroads, hotels, theatres, except in special sections upstairs, have no defense from actual injury. No colored man, unless he be fearless of death, may defend himself from unprovoked attack on the part of any drunken white man who chooses to make it. The consequence of the disregard of the common humanity of the Negro and the white man in the Delta and adjacent regions has been an increasing bitterness that may yet eventuate in catastrophe. In a number of Mississippi cities and elsewhere in the South, Negroes are armed for self-defense. On Friday and Saturday, May 23 and 24, a serious race riot was narrowly averted in Memphis, Tenn. As the Memphis, 'Tenn., Commercial Appeal put it in an editorial, "There was a powder train all over Memphis Saturday. That there was no explosion was due to sheer luck." And all this, the casual visitor finds to his intense astonishment, is due to the belief that despite his achievements in the arts, literature and science in spite of his having evolved America's one contribution to the music of the world—ragtime—in spite of his heroism and efficiency on the battlefields of France, the Negro is considered by Southerners, in virtue of his dark skin: to be something less than human.

Howard University sends us The Howard University Record, a magazine edited by the faculty and students of Howard. There is to be an annual issue of eight numbers, price ten cents per copy, fifty cents a year. The copy at hand contains among other important articles an interesting account by Professors Lightfoot, Locke and Mac-Lear on the part played by Howard University in the war. * * * A valuable and significant piece of work has appeared in the form of a pamphlet by Laura E. Wilkes, of Washington, D. C, entitled "Missing Pages in American History." In this pamphlet Miss Wilkes by patient and arduous investigation has brought together the various bits of evidence which go to show in their entirety the very real and far-reaching part which the American Negro has taken in all the wars of this country. The author says in her introduction, "The facts found herein are "taken from colonial records, state papers, assembly journals, histories of slavery and old-time histories of the various colonies rnd republics." There is a very comprehensive bibliography at the end of this work, which adds not a little to its value. But the real importance of a contribution such as this lies, as we have said before in these columns, in that we Negroes are awakening not only to the fact that we ought to have a literature, a history, a poetical expression, but that we ourselves must produce these things. We must be our own interpreters. It is to be hoped that Miss Wilkes' pamphlet will find its way into every colored school, and every white one too for that 1AA matter, not only for the sake of its content, but for the sake of its latent inspiration. * * * A discussion of the housing situation and the colored people of Chicago has come to us. The pamphlet is the work of Charles S. Duke, A.B., C.E., and is evidently the result of careful and constructive investigation. Mr. Duke not only analyzes the situation but offers a list of remedies, including The Private Company Plan, The Holsman Plan, The Adequate Loan Plan and The Building &amp; Loan Association Plan. His effort is particularly significant during the present housing crisis. SYMPOSIA THE Southern Workman publishes these interesting pronouncements on race relations after the war. The Rt. Rev. Thomas Gailor, Bishop of Tennessee, says: Fundamental rights, so the best white people of the South believe, must never be interfered with except through due process of law. Every man, too, must have the right to choose his own form of labor and to develop his individual powers. The best people of the South want colored people to have these fundamental rights and they want them to be protected in these rights. Obligations, however, are reciprocal. Colored people can help in many ways. We must all remember that prejudice is a fact which must be bravely faced. Men must cultivate honesty, sincerity, and the virtue of moral courage. It is always hard t) suffer and be strong—to be self-controlled. Two wrongs, however, never make a right. The number of people in the South who want to see self-respecting colored people make progress is increasing very fast. Thoughtful colored people must be missionaries to members of their race and restrain those who are quick to resent and who provoke trouble. White and colored people alike have a serious duty and an important work to do. * * * Mrs. John D. Hammond says: Many Negroes, I know, question somewhat seriously the actions of white people. At bottom I think it is well to remember that the main current of the white race is set toward justice. Men everywhere are seeing more clearly than they have ever seen before. The past, nevertheless, is with us and must have some meaning THE LOOKING GLASS for all of us. Only lunatics are not held by their past. A new day never comes ready to order. The new day comes bit by bit. Recently, when I read of the awful things being done in Texas, I said to myself, "Will the colored people believe in us long enough to give us a chance to help them out of their trouble?" The future of the races in the South is in the hands of the colored people. They must hold steady and have faith in the white people when it is hard indeed to have faith. There is no future for the white people unless there is a future also for Negroes. The Germans were fighting against God and eternal justice. God stood in the road at the Marne. God stands also in other roads. We must all put our faith in the God of justice and love. In the South the white people and the colored people are going to be friends—friends who will trust one another and work together for each other's best interests. « * * Robert E. Jones shows that the Great War has opened the eyes of the Negroes: There is one thing this world war has done. It has lifted the Negro problem out of the provincialism of America into the cosmopolitanism of the civilized world. We purpose to carry our cause into the open forum of the world. We purpose to let the world know, that the soldiers who brought glory to the American flag on the fields of France are denied common courtesies in too many cases when they return home. And surely our appeal to the world will not fall altogether on deaf ears. There will be an awakening, you may rest assured a sense of right and of justice that will react upon American life. We make this appeal to the world in no sense of disloyalty to our Nation. We do it because we are loyal. We will be heard. We will not be lynched and robbed and hedged about without a solemn protest. We do not plead for pity or sympathy. We want what we have earned by every rule of the game. Our friends must know our desires. We are making them known in as plain a way as we know how. We do this in love and out of a desire for peace and good will, believing that a more equitable readjustment of the relation of the races in this country will strengthen our National bonds, increase our National wealth, add to our National contentment, and hasten the coming of the Kingdom of God on earth as it is in heaven. * * * Frank J. Parsons points the moral: The greatest development in the South would seem to lie in the direction of agriculture, railroad building, shipping, and manufacturing. Labor will be the big problem and a wise and just handling of the so-called "Negro question" will be an important factor, particularly with the return of the Negro soldier from abroad, with his wider viewpoint, greater discipline, and record of sacrifice and achievement. The best minds in the South are giving thought to some system providing a sound method of saving for colored people and with it an opportunity for reasonable credit in the development of business enterprises for the race. Improved educational facilities will also follow and a, more even-handed justice. The exodus of colored farm hands, dock laborers, and others to the munition fac tories of the North is not without its lesson; and if the South is to take advantage of the full measure of its possibilities for prosperity in the future, it will doubtless give due attention to this important element of its citizenship. THE ANCIENT EVIL THE Pittsburgh, Pa., Dispatch writes on the Anti-Lynching Conference recently held in New York: There is a touch of irony which unfortunately may not penetrate our national vanity in the subscription of a fund of $10,000 to be used to oppose lynching in the United States. The National Conference on Lynching was the inspiration for the fund and a request to every Negro in the United States to contribute $1 each to add to this fund to be employed for the same purpose. If the motives were not so sincere the proposal to raise a fund of thousands of dollars to educate the people who claim to be foremost among enlightened nations, against brutal murders, would be a gigantic joke. The tragedy in the facts do not permit levity, but if they did the spectacle of a special organization raising and using thousands of dollars annually to coax humane Christian people away from a form of vengeful assassination which is not even practiced by the modern savage would force the laughter. Whatever tendency to smile is tempted must be directed against claims for advancement by people who, well in the twentieth century, must be charmed away from habits which the savage man gave up long ago. He kills, but no longer as the American mob kills'. If this were not enough there is the suggestion that a special money fund must be subscribed by rational beings to secure the enforcement of law, which officers are drawing salaries for administering. Then one might give a thought to the effort to have enacted a special law to punish the crime of murder when committed_ by a mob, as if murder by 50 men is not in essence the same as murder by two. * * * The Louisville, Ky., Courier Journal scoffs at the possibility of a governor brave enough to remove a cowardly sheriff. Governor O'Neal, of Alabama, says to the Anti-Lynching Conference in Carnegie Hall, New York: "Lynching can be ended by vesting in Governors the power to remove sheriffs who permit the criminal to pass from the grasp of the law to the clutches of the mob. The record of race riots and mob violence in the North in the last decade shows that neither North nor South could point at the other the finger of scorn. Lynching is a wrong for which the whole country must bear the responsibility." What a remarkable idea! The disposition of governors to exercise such power would depend very largely upon the dispositions of governors. In many cases the governor would find an excuse for the sheriff and decline to turn him out of office. A Democratic sheriff might be, with ostentatious ado, removed from office—kicked out so to speak—by a Republican governor. A Republican sheriff might be thrown down the courthouse steps, figuratively, by a Democratic governor, but a sheriff rarely would be removed by a governor belonging to the political party of the sheriff's adherence. Governor O'Neal may be, and doubtless he is, an executive whose moral austerity is so much greater than his party loyalty; whose virtue so overtops his political ambition that he would not hesitate to cast cut any number of sheriffs guilty of allowing lynchings, but that is not true of governors speaking generally. * * * The Dial has a thoughtful article showing the various aspects which the lynching problem is assuming: An instance of the impossibility of national repentance is the attitude of the American people toward the lynching of Negroes. That the country feels a certain shame is clear. The news of such outrages is now largely suppressed. Even the press foregoes the profit of playing upon its readers' appetitite for atrocities, and when the Liberator published the accounts of certain peculiarly hideous mob crimes, it was roundly denounced for lack of patriotism. An effort to arouse the public conscience on this matter and to initiate works meet for repentance will be made by the National Conference on Lynchings to be held in New York City, May 5 and 6, "to take concerted action against lynching and lawlessness wherever found, and to consider what measures should be adopted to abate them." The words of the call above quoted contain an oblique reference to the fact that lynching is no longer a purely race problem—nor is it always a matter of reprobation and shame. On the contrary, as expression of patriotic sentiment it has been recognized as part of our moral life, and associated with our best efforts toward the progress of the world. * * * So inured has this country become to the idea of violence that we find its aid CRISIS enlisted by patriotic societies, military au thorities, and other sponsors in behalf of the Liberty Loan. There lies a pretty irony. The Dial continues: The chief propagandist for the Security League still boasts of his attempt as agent provocateur before an audience in a Western university. The press has repeatedly borne witness to the crimes of violence committed by men in uniform against persons exercising the right of lawful assembly, but whereas our courts martial have been active in grinding out sentences to death and life imprisonment against men who have failed in some minor observance of military law, we have yet to hear of a case where a soldier has been punished for attacking the institutions of democracy which he was drafted to defend—except the men who rioted Houston, who were black, and who were hanged. An instance of the attitude of the army toward mob law is shown by the petition of soldiers of the 27th Division to General O'Ryan threatening violence unless the entirely lawful performance of opera in German were prevented by "organized action." Apparently the threat was regarded as so natural as to attract no comment or rebuke. An organ which claims to represent the returned soldiers is Arthur Guy Empey's Treat 'Em Rough, whose eminent services are enlisted in behalf of the Victory loan. In the March issue Mr. Empey advises the men who were in the trenches when he was on the lecture platform as follows: "The Fifth Liberty Loan drive will soon be here. Make a Bolshevist or an 'I. W. W.' buy one of those bonds, and believe me, from that time on that fellow is going to support Uncle Sam, and, if necessary, fightfor him. If you cannot, after very patient endeavor, sell him, then show him what it means to get a good Yankee wallop in the nose." * * * The Brooklyn Eagle feels that lack of unanimity among Negroes seriously affects the failure to suppress lynching, surely a superficial view since no matter how much radical and conservative Negroes may differ they are all agreed in their efforts to eradicate the scourge of their race. The Eagle says: If the Negroes stood together on the Booker T. Washington platform they would reduce such bitterness to a minimum and reduce lynching to a minimum. Unfortunately they do not. There is a radical division of Negro sentiment. Washington would have made his race thrifty and industrially efficient, waiving social equality and even political equality for a period of years. On the other hand, at the Anti-Lynching Conference, Dr. William Pickens, dean of Morgan College, in Baltimore, said: THE LOOKING GLASS "There is no use for an executive of the nation to tell the white people of Georgia that their Negroes should have a white man's trial in Georgia if he at the same time takes the position that the Negroes in government departments at Washington should not have a white man's job. That is such gross hypocrisy that it could not escape even a mob. Mob members may be ignorant, in some ways, but they are too severely logical to overlook an inconsistency like that The half freedom of the race in the United States is the foundation of the trouble." The views of the "All-or-Nothing" element of Negro thought were never put more clearly. They command respect, as does much other quixotism. But the perspective of the ages is lacking in men who think in this way, and the immediate future of the race is certainly not made brighter by such utterances. * * * And then the Eagle says amazingly: Few Buffaloes are worrying about the lynching problem. Who would be free himself should first shoot straight. They have learned that primary lesson. COLOR AND ECONOMICS ANITA C. BLOCK says in the Call magazine: There is the popular conviction that the hostility of men toward women in industry is due to "sex antagonism," and another that the hostility of whites toward blacks in industry is due to "race antagonism." That both these enter into the problem is, of course, obvious. But to hold that they constitute the problem is to indulge in what appears always to have been men's favorite mental activity, namely, to be convinced that things are what they seem. Two excellent illustrations—because they are unusually clear—are at hand at the present moment. The first is the announcement that the Pennsylvania Railroad is employing Negroes in all branches of the company's work, most of them in fields where Negroes have not been employed before. The company anticipates little or no trouble with this new class of workers, and holds that they are "worth their pay." Now, what does this mean? Merely that in the crisis in which capitalists .and employers now find themselves cheap, docile labor is the supreme desideratum. If, then, trouble comes between unemployed whites, with a higher standard of living and a higher developed industrial consciousness, and desperate, struggling, competing blacks, will such trouble be the expression of race antagonism? Will it not represent merely one of the inevitable final phases in the blind struggle of the capitalists to save the collapsing wage and profit system of industry and in the equally blind struggle of the workers to live on as they did under conditions that are undergoing revolutionary changes? Will it be the color and difference of race that will be the basic and determining cause, or the fact that the economic history of the Negro, together with the economic development of the capitalist society in which they found themselves, made this conflict inevitable? It seems to be race antagonism, but is it not actually economic antagonism, bred by the failure of the capitalist system of industry to give all an opportunity to labor and to receive the just returns for their labor? * * + In her second illustration the writer introduces the sex as well as the race element and undertakes to show that the problem is none the less basically economic. Of course, the situation is really produced by the interplay of all three factors—race, sex, economic condition. A very large factory in the Middle West has replaced all its employees, even mechanics, with colored women. The manager is reported to have said: "The change surpasses my most sanguine expectations; in other words, we are receiving a full day's work for a full day's pay." Here is, of course, the same situation as that involving Negro male workers, only more so. For, wretched as is the lot of the black man, the black woman's lot is a hundred times worse. Her chance of employment at a decent, self-respecting occupation for anything even approaching a living wage has been, and practically still is, negligible. Her struggle to keep alive and, usually, to help keep several others alive, is a continuous tragedy in its hopelessness of amelioration. On the lowest rung of the long ladder on which labor is trying to climb upward, her passage cruelly barred, stands the Negro woman. Will it be a mixture of sex and race antagonism if white workingmen rise against them? Will it be something that feminist and pro-Negro organizations can combat and end? Is it what it seems, or is it what the Socialist says it is—an economic problem, inevitable in the present crisis in which the existing economc system finds itself— a problem to be solved, not by persuading people that men and women, white and black, are equal and must be granted equal rights and opportunities, but by establishing an economic system, a social and industrial order which will make equality of opportunity and a just reward for labor as inevitable as the rising and setting of the sun? "RENDER UNTO CJESAR" THE Boston, Mass., Traveller says: The colored men of America have fought as valiantly as ever white men fought, and THE CRISIS have acquitted themselves well at all points. When the request is made, as it was at a mass meeting in Tremont Temple the other night, that the reorganized army of the United States should have in it one division of colored troops, completely officered by colored men no valid reason can be produced for not granting it. Indeed, the nation should be more than pleased to note the spirit of loyalty and patriotism which prompts Americans of African descent to ask a place in the new military establishment. During the war, one division, the 92d, was organized entirely of colored troops. It comprised two full regiments of the old National Guard, the 15th of New York and the 8th of Illinois, and other soldiers, mostly selective service men, from all over the country. The line officers of the division were colored as were some of the commissioned officers, including lieutenants, captains, several majors and a lieutenant-colonel. Drilling and fighting shoulder to shoulder in the same units, colored men of all sections have been brought to know and respect one another: A solidarity of the race in America has begun to grow up in consequence. * * * But the Traveller does not feel that mere praise is enough for the colored soldier. More than ever he has proved his fitness to possess the rights of American citizen ship. With new ties of friendship and heightened regard for the mutual obligations imposed by common race and history, the colored people of America may be expected to make a firmer and more united stand than heretofore against the oppression to which members of their race are subjected in some parts of the country. Particularly difficult will it be for those Southern States which have evaded the 15th Amendment of the Constitution by denying the suffrage to large portions of their Negro citizens to keep on with such discrimination. Colored men who are able to fight for America will justly feel that they are entitled to vote in any state of America. When the colored men of the South demand their rights under the Constitution and in the name of justice they will know that their brothers in the North are solidly with them. But the white men of the South, recognizing the services of their colored fighters, may be disposed to place a revised estimate upon the value and character of their colored residents, and to treat them with greater fairness. The African race in America, only two generations away from slavery, has shown splendid capacity, not only in military ways but in every other field of endeavor. Any added recognition of its achievements spells encouragement to a developing people and redounds to the betterment of the nation. FOR PIONEERS H. E. AUGHINBAUGH points out busi ness opportunities for the colored American in the West Indies. He writes in the New York Commercial: In the Dutch, French and British West Indies by far the largest proportion of the inhabitants are pure Negroes, or partially so. In Curacao, which belongs to Holland, in Martinique and Guadeloupe, French possessions, in Jamaica, Trinidad Barbadoes, St. Lucia and Dominica, British colonies, are to be found many prominent business men, estate owners and managers, all full blooded Negroes, and I must say that ttiey are highly intelligent, courteous and hospitable, and as a rule, very responsible tradesmen. I am certain that less social and commercial prejudice exists toward those of mixed or full Negro blood in the West Indies and Latin America than any other place in the world in which I have been. There is practically no so-called "color line." Indeed, I recall that in one Latin American capital of over 100,000 population where I formerly lived it was reported that only six of the native families who resided there were of pure white blood, the remainder being of Negro and white, Negro and Indian, or white and Indian extraction. * * * Of course it would be necessary for the American emigrating to the West Indies to become proficient in Spanish certainly and possibly French. This would open up many points of contact with European culture. Mr. Aughinbaugh continues: I am quite positive that an American Negro, with a college education, and familiar with Spanish, has an exceptionally good chance to establish himself in business in many of the Latin American republics and I particularly recommend that he should try either Haiti or Santo Domingo. In the event of his locating in Haiti, he should study French, for this is the language of the natives. Not only would an American Negro have an opportunity to enjoy commercial or professional prosperity, but he would act as a center of infection for American ideals and in many other obvious ways increase American prestige among his neighbors and at the same time elevate their standards of living. I sincerely trust that some of our commercial concerns now prospecting Latin American fields will at least make an effort to give employment to colored men who show themselves adapted for such work, for I am certain that they would prove business getters in every sense of the word. In this connection it seems to me that many of these Latin American nations offer exceptionally advantageous opportunities to colored professional men, especially dentists, and doctors.

Mr. Butler was the feature of the meet, winning five first, two second, and one third of the eight events in which he participated. The main building of Princess Anne Academy, a branch of Morgan College, Baltimore, Md., has been destroyed by fire supposed to have originated from an overheated stove in the laundry. The loss, partly covered by insurance, is between $15,000 and $20,000. At the fiftieth anniversary of Rutgers' College Chapter, February 22, 1919, four under-graduates were initiated to membership in the Phi Beta Kappa. Among these was Paul L. Robeson, a Negro, who leads the Senior Class both in scholarship and athletics. For four years Mr. Robeson has been a member of the Football Team, and during the season 1917-1918 he gained national fame by being selected as Ail-American end by Walter Camp; he has won his varsity letter as center on the Basketball Team, catcher on the Baseball Team, and weight thrower on the Track Team; he has also been a member of the Debating Team.

An impressive performance of "Hiawatha's Wedding Feast" was given at Town Hall, Birmingham, this spring; at Plymouth, the Lancaster Choral Society gave the part-song "Song of the Peddlar"; and the Band of the R. M. L. I., Plymouth Division, played works of this composer on a late program; at Glasgow, Scotland, the Singer Mixed-Voice Choir rendered "Summer is Gone." That the daughter of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor has inherited her father's genius is proven by recently published pieces and by successful concert appearances in London. Carl Diton's arrangement of " Deep River" for mixed voices was performed at one of the music festival concerts, with Mr. Diton conducting. Under the management of Mrs. Daisy Tapley, the final recital in a series of educational recitals was given at the Rush Memorial Church, New York City, on May 22. The artists were William H. Richardson, baritone of Boston, Mass.; Carl Diton, piano soloist, and Maud Cuney Hare at the piano.

Mr. Sanchez was formerly a member of an operatic orchestra in Cuba. The Freshman Class Song of Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Mass., for the first time in the school's history was judged the winner in the song competition held on Founder's Day. The music was written by a colored student, Miss Marietta Bonner, who was the winner in the Freshman Class Song Competition held earlier in the year. Mr. and Mrs. Enrico Caruso and officials of the Atlanta Music Festival Association visited Morris Brown University to hear Negro melodies sung by the students. Mr. Caruso rendered an impromptu recital, including three opera solos, while Mrs. Caruso made what is said to be her first public speech.

Mr. Howard A. Fisher says: "We are determined that our children shall know the truth!" The League for Democracy, an organization of Negro officers who served in the recent war, has written an open letter to the Secretary of War concerning the letter of Colonel Allen J. Greer to Senator McKellar (published in the May, 1919, CRISIS) which says in part: "We cannot permit our descendants to read this letter in future histories and look upon our graves with scorn and contempt for permitting them to be branded as moral lepers, cowards and dogs before they were born. In this matter our slogan is 'Greer must be tried and the race vindicated.'

POLITICS THE Beatty Equal Rights Bill has been defeated in the Lower House of the Ohio Legislature by a 35—16 vote; as a result the Colored Women's Republican Club, in Columbus, has cut its party affiliations and become The Colored Women's Independent Political League. Mrs. Rosa Moorman, president, declared that when she took a petition asking favorable action on the bill to men "whom we helped elect," they were utterly out of sympathy with the movement. Considerable numbers of colored people are registering as voters at Columbia. S. C. SOCIAL PROGRESS FiFTY colored girls of the Y. W. C. A. in San Antonio, Tex., have formed the Five Cent Agency. They go out and collect once a month five cents apiece from each of their friends for the support of club work among colored girls. As much as $86 has been collected in one day by these girls. A five-day campaign of the colored Y. M. C. A., Washington, D. C , for 500 members has resulted in 1,555 new members. Mr. John W. Davis is the executive secretary of this branch.

A colored nurse has been engaged by the Health Department of Charlotte, N. C. The University Commission on Southern Race Questions, a white organization, at its ninth annual meeting after praising Negro soldiers makes this appeal to college men: "Let us seek to cultivate a more tolerant spirit, a more generous sympathy and a wider degree of co-operation between the best elements of both races; to emphasize the best rather than the worst features of inter-racial relations; to secure greater publicity for those whose vows are based on reason rather than prejudice." The New Orleans Area of the C. M. E. Church has in sixty days raised $91,378 in cash, with subscriptions amounting to $430, 189 pledged in the Centenary Drive. At Raleigh, N. C , during last year the State Division of Education and Health Work Among Negroes organized 410 Community Leagues with a membership of over 15,000. There were held 494 public meetings, reaching nearly 60,000 Negroes, and through the distribution of literature 112,000 additional Negroes were reached. The response to this effort has been so satisfactory that the work has been enlarged. The Nutrition Clinics for Delicate Children has extended its work to serve the Negro race, by the establishment of such clinics in hospitals, schools and child-helping centers. It has headquarters at 44 Dwight Street, Boston, Mass.

THE CRISIS ADVERTISER Reconstruction War — and its aftermath—has opened the eyes of our people. They are now seeing and thinking straight. They now demand of individuals and enterprises seeking their patronage and support, performance rather than glittering promises. They also demand evidences of stability in such enterprises and experience on the part of those conducting them. The management of the Southern Aid Society of Virginia, Inc., rejoices to see this day—They have labored, in season and out, for 26 years to help to bring about just such improvement in our business relationships. The Southern Aid Society of Virginia, Inc., has always issued a superior contract—The only one guaranteeing payments for Sickness and Accidents each week of every year and an undiminished Death Claim after death. To-day it challenges the country to show a better record—than the following—for an institution confining its business to its Home State. 26 years of satisfying service to policy-holders. $30,000.00 Capital Stock, fully paid in. $50,000.00 Federal, State &amp; City Bonds. $50,000.00 1st Lien Mortgages—Loans to our people to secure good homes in desirable locations. $100,000.00 Cash in Banks. $150,000.00 Real Estate—Free from all encumbrances.
