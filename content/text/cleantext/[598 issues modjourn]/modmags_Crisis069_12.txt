Interest is compounded quarterly. 114 TH E CRISIS MUSIC AND ART &lt;&lt;|T H. T. BURLEIGH: composer by divine right and 'The American Coleridge-Taylor' " is the title of a full page article concerning a distinguished musician in the April 29 issue of Musical America. A sketch of Mr. Burleigh's career is given, his progress as a singer and composer, and the acknowledgement that having "won praise from musicians who withheld it until he showed that he had in him not the average attainment of a composer of singable songs, but the extraordinary gifts to which his present output in the department of the art-song testifies," he has now come into his own. The interviewer closes with the words that "H . T. Burleigh is contributing to American art-song examples of creative music that deserve world-wide attention and respect." C. S. Coleridge-Taylor's " A Tale of Old Japan" was one of the choral works performed on May 19 by the Nashua Oratorio Society at its fifteenth annual festival, held in the City Hall of Nashua, N. H. The conductor, Mr. Hood, is a warm admirer of the work. The composer's "Life and Death" was also sung by the soprano, Hazel Miliken, at one of the solo performances. C A t the great Shakespeare Tercentenary celebration at Drury Lane, London, Coleridge-Taylor's "Othello" suite was played in a notable list of music for the performances of the dramas. C Kitty Cheatham, noted American singer, and the Edith Rubel trio gave a recital of folk music before the New York Cosmopolitan Club on May 17. On the program were folk songs of many countries. At the close of the program she sang Afro-American folk songs, of which Musical America says: "This artist is today admittedly the supreme exponent." That Miss Cheatham can now be heard on the phonograph is considered great cause for satisfaction for the main reason that it will afford permanent example of proper interpretation of pure Negro songs. A reviewer continues: "Miss Cheatham has striven indefatigably for years to impress upon the contemporary Negro the need of preserving this folk music in all its original purity." G Mrs. Maud Cuney Hare, pianist-lecturer, and Mr. William H. Richardson, baritone, of Boston, Mass., have lately completed a successful tour in the North and middle states. Requests were made in many cities for return engagements. Among their notable appearances was that in Columbus, O., where they were heard at the Chamber of Commerce before an audience of eleven hundred persons that included the governor of the State of Ohio, Adjt. Gen'l Hough and wife, and many others of distinction. Governor Willis remained to offer personal felicitations to the artists. C Selections by Gomez, Verdi and Friedmann were added to the program by the Ohio National Guard Band, Mr. S. P. White, director; Mr. Thos. Howard, manager. C Among the many successful engagements filled by Mr. Roland W. Hayes, tenor, was that of soloist in Coleridge-Taylor's "Hiawatha," which was given a splendid rendition by the Douglass Choral Society at Cincinnati, O., in May. The concert was given under the excellent direction of Mr. Evermont P. Robinson. Mr. J. H. Robinson was the accompanist. The society hopes to bring before the public the possibilities of the public school as a center to promote musical appreciation in the community. (I Miss Helen Hagan, pianist, prize pupil of the Yale Conservatory of Music, completed in May a very successful Western concert tour. C The Girls' High School Dramatic Club of Boston, Mass., presented "Twelfth Night," a production in which Miss Elise W. Thurston, a colored student, as "Orsino," received considerable praise. (I On May 16 a concert was given in Steinert Hall, Boston, Mass., by Miss Gertrude O'Neil, soprano, who was assisted by two students of the New England Conservatory of Music, Mr. Clyde L. Glass, pianist, and Mr. Wesley Howard, violinist. Mr. J. Shelton Pollen was the accompanist, d Mr. Henry Lee Grant of Washington, D. C , was heard in a piano recital at Charles Street A. M. E. Church, Boston, Mass., on May 11. Mr. Clarence Cameron White, violinist, assisted on the program and played an interesting group of pieces by modern composers. C "Nebber Min', Mah Honey" is one of three new songs by Franklin Riker, an American composer. Mr. Riker is said to have decided gifts in the writing of Negro songs, as evidenced in his "Mister Honey Boy," published last winter. 0 Mrs. May Howard Jackson has on exhibition at the Veerhoff gallery, Washing ALONG THE COLOR LINE ton, D. C , three recent works in sculpture •—one a portrait bust of Prof. Kelly Miller, a small head of a child, and the third, "Mulatto Mother and Her Child." The Washington Star says: "The last is a very remarkable and dramatic work, touching upon the mysteries of heredity in a way which is exceedingly striking," and adds: "Her work has always shown promise, but these pieces now on exhibition indicate exceptional gift, for they are not merely well modeled, but individual and significant." C The second annual recital of the Detroit Musical Study Club was held at Ebenezer Church, May 9. C Frederick Cowans cantata, "The Rose Maiden," was given at Hampton Institute at its May Festival. A chorus of nearly one thousand voices, under the direction of R. Nathaniel Dett, was a prominent feature, and the following artists appeared: Mrs. F. C. Talbert, soprano, Mrs. Daisy Tapley, contralto, Mr. George R. Garner, Jr., tenor, Mr. Paige I. Lancaster, baritone, and Miss Helen Elise Smith, pianist. C The Washington, D.

No attempt is made to burlesque the race, but only white actors and actresses will be used. C The Dayton, 0., Daily News says that Sam Stewart, the colored composer of that city, "has had more good music stolen from him than many popular composers have written in their entire career." Stewart has just written the music for "It Happened Thus," a musical comedy, which is now touring the Middle West.

It voted also that, conforming to the suggestion of the joint commission, the colored membership of the reorganized church be constituted into one or more quadrennial or jurisdictional conferences. This foreshadows the exclusion of colored delegates in the M. E. General Conference when the union of Northern and Southern Methodists is accomplished. C The African M. E. General Conference was the one hundredth General Conference of the Church, and met in historic Bethel, Philadelphia, Pa. It elected two bishops, the Rev. W. W. Beckett of Charleston, S.

Factories are crowding the residential sections in some parts of the city, and very little attention is given to the cleaning of streets in the colored section. On one of the residental streets a dump pile has been started where all kinds of filth and refuse is thrown, thus endangering the lives and health of hundreds of people in the neighborhood. C Collier's Weekly writes the CRISIS denying that it discriminates against colored patrons.

WATKINS call him great for whom man strong Crush mountains, shatter worlds and mold and sure, them o'er, Charged with the leaping lightning of But he who rules himself is greater still. his will, The Looking Glass LITERATURE ISS ALICE WERNER, an English expert in ethnology, has just published through the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, a pamphlet on "The Bantu Coast Tribes of the East Africa Protectorate." The pamphlet contains a great deal of careful and detailed information together with a number of plates. We quote one legend: "Long ago there was a man Sangowere; he was not born, he was a man without father or mother; we call him 'the man who appeared.' Well, when he appeared and came into the world, he produced the Buu tribe. And the Buu tribe increased. And while they were cultivators, they also had many cattle, and they made friendship with the Galla. When the Galla saw that they had cattle, they strove and strove and strove, and the Wapakomo were conquered, and the Galla took away from them all their cattle, and they became subject to the Galla. And when the cattle fell sick, the Wapakomo were called in to cure them, and God (Muungu) helped them, till the great sickness of the cattle was cured; but at first they did not cease killing them. Well, during the first fighting they (the Pokomo) left the country, but the Galla did not want them to leave and go to another country, but they just went. Those who stayed behind hid themselves in pits—some lived there for years, others died there in the earth." Rabbi Joseph Krauskopf, of Philadelphia, has been preaching a series of sermons, of which number five, on the "American Negro," has been issued in pamphlet form. The pamphlet concludes: "Inequality before the law between the white and colored American must cease. Lynch law must be rooted out. To the disfranchisement of the Negro-citizen an effective stop must be put. Having dragged the Negro from his country to ours, and made a slave of him, having set him free, after two and a half centuries of bondage, he is entitled, by all that is right and holy, to his full freedom, and to all the educational and economic advantages that may make his freedom a bless ing to the white man as well as to him self." Mr. Alain LeRoy Locke has issued a syllabus of an extension course of lectures on "Race Contacts and Inter-Racial Relations." It consists of five theses with bibliographies. The chief justice of Liberia has issued a small pamphlet of nineteen pages on his country, containing the substance of an oration delivered last year. We have received the Richard Allen Monthly, a Sunday school journal issued by the A. M. E. Union, Nashville, Tenn. W. V. Jenkins has published a book of short stories for the benefit of the Gate City Free Kindergarten Association of Atlanta, Ga. Mr. B. G. Brawley has published in the Dial the leading article on the "Negro in American Fiction." The article ends with this: "Some day we shall work out the problems of our great country. Some day we shall not have a state government set at defiance, and the massacre of Ludlow. Some day our little children will not slave in mines and mills, but will have some chance at the glory of God's creation; and some day the Negro will cease to be a problem and become a human being. Then, in truth, we shall have the Promised Land. But until that day comes let those who mould our ideals and set the standards of our art in fiction at least be honest with themselves and independent. Ignorance we may for a time forgive; but a man has only himself to blame if he insists on not seeing the sunrise in the new day." POLITICS DEMOCRACY in Oklahoma is illustrated by the following correspondence : BOLEY, OKLA. 5/4/16. To the Governor, HON. R. L. WILLIAMS, Oklahoma City, Okla. Dear Sir: We, the United Colored Citizens of Boley, Okfuskee county, precinct No. 7, in mass meeting assembled on the above date mentioned, unite in petitioning your Honor as TH E CRISIS follows: First, we have abundant and unimpeachable proof that we have made every honest effort and endeavor to get registered under the new law, but have been unsuccessful after four days' trial, following the appointment of the precinct registrar. We succeeded in finding him, and asked to be registered. He resigned rather than register Negroes. We also have reliable evidence that during the first three days of his appointment he went in person to the white citizens in our precinct and registered them, then resigned before we Negroes could be registered. No registrar has been appointed in his stead to our knowledge, and we are unable to find out. If one has been appointed, even from the proper source we, therefore, have no one to register us, and there remains but a few more days under the new law to be registered. This is National Election Year and we desire to vote for U . S. congressmen if for no other candidate, although we would be proud to exercise our full Elective Franchise guaranteed to us by the State and National Constitution. We, therefore, make this earnest appeal to you as chief executive of the state (as local recourses have been exhausted) that you enforce the laws of this state, and see that the county registrar appoints the precinct registrar at once, and report to you his appointee, and you report to us through W. E. Rainwater by wire at our expense. We remain very respectfully yours, COLORED CITIZENS OF BOLEY, OKLA., Okfuskee county, precinct. OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLA., EXECUTIVE DEPT. May 5, 1916. MR. J. S. MANNING, Boley, Okla. Dear Sir: I have received your wire under date of May 4. I immediately attempted to get in com munication with the secretary of the Sen ate, who appoints the county registrars, and ascertained that he had not returned from Texas county. About two weeks ago I was advised that he had gone to Texas county under the advice of his physician, he being at the time very unwell, and that he had not returned. I will still further try to get in touch with him and if I am able to do so, I will advise him of the situation in your precinct, so he can take up the matter with the county registrar as to rilling the vacancy in your precinct. You are probably aware of the fact that the governor of the state has nothing to do with the appointing of the county registrars. Yours very truly, A. N . LECRAFT, Secretary to the Governor. The Black Dispatch, a colored paper of Oklahoma, says: "Saturday, April 20, the editor of this paper decided to vote in the bond election. So with much speed he put in his appearance at the voting place in precinct 13 of the Second ward. With studied intention he presented his registration certificate to the election judge, H . Sonneschin, without verbal disclosure of his name. Sonneschin gazed thereon for a full minute, his brow wrinkled; finally he said sternly: 'What is your name?' Dunjee answered: 'There it is written on that piece of paper.' About this time the other judge reached over and possessed himself of the 'Belshazzer Document' and instantly snorted, 'I can't read this.' Dunjee answered: 'I can't either, but to save you any further trouble I would like to state that the man who worked on that tried to write 'Roscoe Dunjee.' Shades of high heaven! to think that the state of Oklahoma would pass a literacy test election law, and then place the administration of that law into the hands of men who themselves are not literate. Registration certificates are supposed to be used for purposes of identification, but when the thing does not identify what must one do? Those judges Saturday did not know to whom that registration certificate belonged, not if they decided by the writing. That style of handwriting, of McCormick's, grows cold quickly, and the low temperature it created Saturday was very pronounced. One thing is certain: Old man Consistency has got to put in his appearance in Oklahoma, and with a big stick loosen up the skulls of those who think that men who are ignorant and illiterate ought to have the right to sit in judgment upon those who have forgotten more than they can ever know." The colored people are pressing forward to use the few political rights that are left them in the South. The Norfolk, Va., Journal and Guide is appealing for votes against the mayor: 130 THE "No mayor within a period of forty years has treated the colored citizens of Norfolk with the contempt that has been accorded them from the present mayor s office. . . • "The city council passed a resolution appropriating $400.00 for the entertainment of the National Convention of the Colored Elks that met in Norfolk in August, 1914. The mayor vetoed the appropriation and the colored citizens never got the money. "When the vicious photo-play, 'The Birth of a Nation,' was advertised to appear here white and colored citizens appealed to the mayor to forbid the play. He declined to act, and after its appearance here sent a letter to Richmond's mayor approving the play. "When the Negro Organization Society, a body that has been addressed by the governor of the state and other influential white citizens, met in Norfolk, the mayor was invited to welcome the body, but declined to do so. "Mayor Mayo declined an invitation to make a welcome address to the annual conference of the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church which met in Norfolk in April. Nor did he designate any one to represent him. "The mayor was asked to extend an official welcome to the Virginia Baptist State Convention which met in Norfolk last month, and refused to do so, or to designate any one to represent him. "He was invited to welcome the Baptist General Association of Virginia which met in Norfolk in May of this year, but ignored the invitation. "Upon all occasions and under all circumstances, therefore, the mayor of the whole city of Norfolk, who is supposed to be the mayor of all citizens, white and black, has been unapproachable where one body or group of citizens was concerned, and has given thousands of visitors to the city the impression that the mayor of the city is entirely out of touch and out of sym pathy with the 35,000 colored citizens under his jurisdiction. "Colored citizens should register their disapproval of the mayor's course by voting against him in the election on Tuesday, June 13." The Bessemer, Ala., Weekly says that Thomas J. Judge, a candidate for Congress, has been attacking a rival candidate, Hud CRISIS dleston, because "Mr . Huddleston made a speech before the Bar Association in Montgomery in 1912, in which he used the following language: 'The right of suffrage should be extended irrespective of race or sex, irrespective of everything save honesty and intelligence.' "Mr . Judge dramatically responded to this, 'The white men of Alabama will never consent to Negro suffrage.' " The Weekly points out that so far as the letter of the law is concerned colored men can still vote in Alabama, and it is interesting to learn that Mr. Huddleston has been elected to Congress since his speech, and still more recently has defeated Mr. Judge in the Democratic primaries. The Louisville, Ky., Courier Journal says tersely: "The Courier Journal has never overlooked an opportunity to advise the Negro voter to vote as a man and a citizen and not as the 'nigger' of any political party. The same advice is due any American, of whatever color or racial extraction, who is asked to become a cog in political machinery and surrender his personal views, his political independence, his manhood, to an organization which has aims and objects of its own, one of which is owning him." The South and its "Copper-head" friends, like Borah, of Idaho, are straining every nerve to make woman suffrage a "Negro" problem. Harriett Stanton Blatch, who has been talking in Idaho, goes after the Senator this way: "Senator Borah argues that as the Fifteenth amendment has not been enforced for the colored man, a federal amendment for women's suffrage would be but a fraud upon the Negro women. The answer is obvious: If Senator Borah thinks the amendments his party passed are not enforced and yet ought to be, why has he not fought steadily ever since he has been in the Senate for the accomplishment of his beliefs ? Why does he seek to ease his conscience by penalizing women politically?" A "Northern woman," yclept Mrs. Albert T. Leatherbee, writes to the Selma, Ala., Journal: "It is beyond the comprehension of one who has traveled in this region to imagine how any Southern white women could have been inveigled into a movement so fraught THE LOOKING with danger to the best interests of that section and which is so menacing, not only to its social, political and economic future, but to its very existence. "We of the North have become accustomed to the suffrage assertions, constantly reiterated from their platforms, that the white women of the country are in the same condition as the ante-bellum male Negroes of the South, and that we, too, need emancipation. We are used to the spectacle of suffrage workers pleading with Negro men to give white women the ballot, and we are perfectly familiar with the jibes thrown at the anti-suffrage women to the effect that, like the black slaves of the sixties, we do not realize our slavery, and have not mental capacity to desire political freedom. . . . "Southern chivalry should be, and undoubtedly is based upon more solid foundations. In kindness to the misguided suffrage women themselves, as well as for the political and racial welfare of all, and the prosperity and progress of their sovereign states, Southern men should refuse to heed the foolish and fatal song of the suffrage sirens." The suffragists of Columbus, O., in appealing for help from their colored sisters, elicited this sharp reply: "We are of the opinion that in a general sense there is no good reason why all women should not have suffrage. If by assisting in the procurement of this great constitutional right we do not injure ourselves, and on the contrary, can add anything to our means of defense and betterment as a race, we are willing to do it. It is certain that the granting of suffrage would be of no practical advantage to colored women, if by the enfranchisement of white women we help to increase the number of our civil and political oppressors. We have opposition enough in our struggle as a race for our civil rights and cannot consent to increase the forces against us. "We have the impression that some of the members of your organization favor race discrimination and segregation as against colored people with reference to their polit ical and civil rights. In fact it has been stated that much of the race discrimination now apparent in places of public entertain ment, amusement, hotels, soda fountains (even in our department stores), and dis GLASS crimination against colored employees has its origin among the prominent white women of this city, including some of your association. "We believe in the homely maxim, 'One good turn deserves another.' We are willing to cooperate with you in the effort to obtain the adoption of a suffrage amendment to the Constitution on certain considerations and conditions; we are willing to assist you if you are willing to assist us. If your association will actively and earnestly aid us in our movement to prevent race discrimination in this city against colored people, and will cooperate with us at all times, and ways, to prevent the abuses to which we are constantly subjected in public places of accommodation and enjoyment, in residence localities, office buildings, employment, etc., we will use our influence energetically among the men of our race to further the adoption of the suffrage amendment and will cooperate with you fully and sincerely in the promotion of your cause at all times and places where it is wise and profitable that we should do so. "It is a generally known fact that the men of our race have been so deceived and mistreated in their efforts to secure justice, and their civil and political rights, that they do not generally favor women's suffrage because to them the ballot in the hands of white women appears only in the light of an increased number of civil and political oppressors. Therefore, we will have a task of some magnitude and difficulty to prevent their voting against it. But we think if the white women prove their fairness by assisting us as herein mentioned we can wield a great influence with the men of our race if we undertake to do so." LABOR RANK D. RASH of Kentucky said at the National Association of Manufacturers in New York City: "In advance of the Negro's industrial progress has gone very naturally his moral and educational development, and the eagerness with which many are seizing every advantage offered by their institutions plainly foreshadows a still more wonderful development in all those attributes which go to make up citizens of whom we will have no reason to feel ashamed. 132 THE "In the light of these conditions, is there not good reason to consider this Southern Negro as one of the South's greatest industrial assets, and does it not behoove Southern industry to deal with him so fairly, so honestly, so uprightly as to maintain unimpaired that loyalty and strong feeling of common interest found in this plain, straightforward workman?" SCHOOLS HE Tattler, a colored paper of Muskogee, Okla., talks plainly about the indefensible treatment of colored schools: "There is no legal, fair or reasonable ex cuse for the closing of the Negro schools, while the white schools are continued throughout the term of nine months. It is simply one of the tricks of the pot-house crowd, who have been mistrusted with the school affairs of the people of the district, and have presumed in their power that peo ple must stand for anything they do. It is the fault of our leading men of the race, that our people stand for such acts from the school board, which the people know are contrary to law and without precedent. It seems to be a modern case of Jacob and Esau, and the sale of the birth-right for the mess of pottage "We have had schools in Oklahoma, when we had no money at all and the will of the people as expressed at the annual meeting of the district was respected, and the term finished in accord with their wishes. The law provides that the school may be con tinued, and that a tax shall be made to cover the length of the term. The Musko gee School Board has robbed the Negro children of a part of the term of school. They have maliciously taken from them that which is guaranteed them under the law and by common consent of the whole people of the state, the county and the na tion. If the same act had been committed upon people who are able to defend them selves, they would have been run out of the community as undesirable citizens and would forever be treated as dangerous crim inals. "Mrs. A . C. Perdue, one of the teachers of the city school, who had the backbone to have an opinion, and to express it, offered her services free, for the balance of the term, if the board would let her have the use of the building, which was denied her, CRISIS and the men who were present at the meeting where she made this offer dared not open their mouths, to endorse or repudiate her action. If the affairs of the race were turned over to the women for a while we might expect some advancement. One thing might be predicted; that the women would not take fifty years to do what might be accomplished in a few months. They would show some nerve, at least." Florida Catholics have been aroused by an attempt to enforce the law against white teachers in colored schools. Congregation alists and other denominations weakly sur rendered and withdrew their white teach ers, but the Catholics have placidly gone along ignoring the law for three years. The New Orleans, La., Morning Star says: "The wheels of state courts were set in motion by six Negroes. They are: D. G. Adger, H. H. Johanson, N. Williams, Robt. Houston, H. G. Tye, J. A. Jackson. Back of them were the white bigots, who have not the manhood or principle of a dead mouse, bigots who are mere apologies for men and who dare not show their faces or give their names. The bigots in power knew that bigots with votes were behind the move. "Hence the arrest of three Catholic sis ters on Easter Monday in St. Augustine. There is no use in hiding the state's shame. The people of Florida have courted this shame." It continues, editorially: "The outrageous and disgraceful action of the governor of Florida in issuing an order to the sheriff at St. Augustine to ar rest the sisters of St. Joseph in that city because they were teaching little colored children to read and write and know the name of God, prompts the question, Are freedom and religious liberty doomed in America? Is the proud boast that we are a nation of freemen to become a myth and a farce?" The Miami. Fla., Herald says: "It is fair to ask the people of the state to contemplate the position in which Flor ida will be placed in the eyes of other states, when it becomes known that under a law passed in 1913, common missionary work done in private schools will subject the teacher to imprisonment and fine." It is pleasing to know that the law was promptly declared unconstitutional by the Florida courts, and the Atlanta, Ga., Con stitution says: THE LOOKING GLASS "Action of the Florida circuit court in declaring' unconstitutional the law enacted in that state prohibiting white persons from teaching in Negro schools, or vice versa, will be commended by all conservative and right-thinking citizens." The San Francisco, Cal., Monitor adds: "Three nuns of Florida were recently ar rested for violating a new law making it illegal for white persons to teach Negroes in that state. The case will be carried to the Supreme Court of the United States. Before the Civil War a distinguished French traveler wrote of his visit to a Southern family: 'I came to the land of liberty and the door was opened by a slave.' Evidently the slave spirit has not com pletely vanished from the South." '•SASSING BACK" EWS and comment in the CRISIS call forth much counter opinion. The Selma, Ala., Times publishes this reply of Helen Keller to attacks upon her on account of her letter in the CRISIS : " 'I have gone through my letter to Mr. Oswald Garrison Villard of New York, printed as a paid advertisement in the Selma Journal, sentence by sentence, and I do not find a phrase that justifies the editor's as sertion that I advocate the social equality of white people and Negroes, so repugnant to all. " 'The equality I advocated in my letter is the equality of all men before the law, which the Constitution of the United States is supposed to guarantee to every American citizen. I believe we should never do unto a son or daughter of God what one would not have done unto his own son or daughter. That is my idea of the teachings of Christ. " 'In my spoken and written words I try always to be faithful to the truth as I understand it. If my words written in this spirit, result in the loss of engagements in any part of the country, I shall regard that loss as an offering to the cause of honest thought, and the sacrifice will afford me true happiness. " 'The editor of the Selma Journal printed for a consideration words which he described editorially as "full of untruths, full of fawning and boot-licking phrases." There are times when we are honored by the enemies we make. The insult which the "Alabamian" flings at the woman who has been my teacher and faithful helper for twenty-nine years deserves the contempt which I am sure it will receive from every right thinking man and woman in the South. " 'HELEN KELLER.' " A writer in the Times says: "This girl, noble in character, superb in intellect, marvelous in attainment, came not into our midst to inflict nor promulgate any views she may have relegated to herself the right to possess, but came to tell the simple story of a life, the marvel of the world today. She was brought as a guest to whom we might do homage, having attained the highest pinnacle of fame, a life unscathed, unspotted, without blemish, pure, undefiled. Yet, now upon Selma's boasted escutcheon must needs lie the dark blot of having offended by gross injustice this world-famed, world-beloved daughter, the marvel of all nations, and with it all the beloved daughter of our own state. "We were privileged to offer her praise, applaud and God-speed, we cast aspersions, we extend accusations, reiterated even in the face of the explanation of the supposed offending clause. "She fled the city in the bleak darkness of a cold night, shaking, as it were, the very dust from her feet, yet doubtless throwing over it all the mantle of charity from the depths of her broad, sympathetic, trained heart and mind." The Omaha Nebraskan is peevish over one of our suggestions: "The CRISIS, a Negro organ, pays a deserved tribute to the valor of the colored troops on the Mexican border and says: 'So in America, in Europe and in Africa black men are fighting- for the liberties of white men and pulling their chestnuts out of the fire. One of these bright mornings black men are going to learn how to fight for themselves.' "But they are fighting for themselves when they make the splendid record they are making in Mexico. They were fighting for themselves when they made their record in Cuba. They were not then, nor are they now, pulling white men's chestnuts out of the fire. They were and are fighting for a country that is theirs, as it is the white man's, and in whose history and achievements they will have a part commensurate with the contributions they make. "The CRISIS gives its people very poor TH E CRISIS advice when it intimates that the interests of the colored race lie along lines of fighting for themselves in the sense plainly meant by the CRISIS. "To be sure, the colored race has had many obstacles to surmount, but the race has advanced and will advance in accordance with the efforts of its intelligent members to contribute to the general good, to build for civilization and to do their part in the most effective way. "When such plays as 'The Birth of a Nation' give offense let the race show itself superior to the touch of such humiliations and, bearing it with dignity, win the respect and sympathy of white men who cannot give approval to such taunts. "There is but one way for any individual or any race to push forward. That way is so plainly marked that it need not be stated. "The conduct of the colored troops in Mexico has done much to break down preju dice and win respect for the Negro race. So the generally fine conduct of Omaha Negroes—so often commented upon by observing men—is doing much to do away with this prejudice. " 'Upward and onward,' not through force, but through civilization's instrumentalities, through faithful service as soldiers and good conduct as citizens—that is the motto and that is the course for every individual and every race who would win the spurs." We are properly impressed by all this, but we beg to call the editor's attention to our lynching supplement. Last and least, we notice again the Morn ing Telegraph, of New York City: "Quoting from the Morning Telegraph, the CRISIS says: 'Who has hazed the Negro? Who has lynched 3,000 of them in the last generation?' We stop right there to consider the question. Who has lynched 3,000 Negroes? There is only one reply: White men—white men driven to frenzy and fury. Inquiry will show that more than 60% of the Negroes slain by mobs in America were guilty of the 'usual crime.' The assertion of the CRISIS that Negroes of America are 'insulted from their getting up to their lying down' is not worth talking about. No one insults Negroes at all, and the black folk do not think they are being insulted." The editor's statement as to lynchings is false. In less than 30% of the lynchings in the last two decades has criminal assault of women been even alleged as an excuse. Moreover, who is a better authority on the feelings of colored people than a white editor of a New York paper? We sympathize with the editor's lack of desire "to get into an argument or have any slight bickering with our contemporary." THE CHURCH TH E white man's prejudice is the colored man's burden," said Bishop J. W. Hamilton at the Saratoga Conference of the M. E. Church. His statement is strikingly illustrated by a leaflet issued by the Rev. F. J. Grimke, of Washington, D. C Dr. Grimke tells of an invitation sent to twenty-five leading colored pastors of that city by the American Bible Society. A great pageant had been planned on the "Bible and Human Life" to celebrate the one hundreth anniversary of the organization. They proposed, however, that the colored people, not being "human," should have a "separate" pageant, for which the Bible Society would pay. The proposition was unanimously rejected by the colored ministers. Dr. Grimke adds: "I found myself saying, How this wretched, miserable, utterly unworthy spirit of race prejudice injects its poison into everything. A great Bible Society cannot celebrate its hundredth anniversary without getting down on its knees and wallowing in the dust before it, without paying deference to it, without bending its neck to its yoke. It was a shameful thing to do! The meeting that was held in Continental Hall on Sunday, with an address from the President of the United States, in the presence of foreign ambassadors and cabinet ministers, senators and representatives, great as it may have been, and as widely as it may tend to advertise the society, cannot wipe out this blot upon its fair name. One thing only, of a redeeming character, in connection with the affair, has come to my knowledge. At the preliminary meeting here, when the question was brought up, I am informed that there was one lady, high in the social circles of the capital, who stood up bravely in the spirit of Jesus Christ, and said it would be most unfortunate for the Bible Society to discriminate against the colored people in this celebration. There were a few others who stood by her; but the great majority thought otherwise; they preferred Barabbas to Jesus." Editorial PAGE 149 WE wish to call attention not only to our lynching supplement but also to the advertisement of the Na tional Association for the Advancement of Colored People on page 149 of this issue. Let every one read this and act. OUR GRADUATES WE note with no little gratification the steady increase in the size of the little companies of colored men and women who are acquiring the higher training in the leading universities of this country. This spring has seen the largest of these groups graduate. Over three hundred and fifty young people have received the Bachelor's degree in Arts, and to these may be added large numbers of professional men and an army of high school graduates. This is reassuring. It shows that no amount of discouragement and insincere argument has been able to convince the colored people of this country that their ultimate survival does not depend upon the thorough training of their men of exceptional ability. We are sorry that the General Education Board does not apparently agree with them, and that of the $100,000 given to Negro institutions this year only $10,000 goes to higher education. LYNCHING WE make no apology for including in this number a detailed account with pic tures of perhaps the most horrible lynching that has taken place in the United States We know that those who so hate the evil of this world that they are unwilling to be disturbed by it will question our taste, but as we have already questioned theirs on numerous occasions there is here, at least, no chance for misunderstanding. To other persons we say as we have said before: any talk of the moral leadership of this country in the world; any talk of the triumph of Christianity, or the spread of human culture, is idle twaddle so long as the Waco lynching is possible in the United States of America. A PLANK HIS Association urged the fol lowing plank on the Repub lican and Progressive con ventions : "To correct the evils affecting our 10,000,000 colored fellow-citizens we pledge ourselves to establish equal Congressional representation for all sections of the country by apportioning seats in Congress in accordance with the voting population; to put an end to lynching—which is a national crime calling for national action; to abolish all forms of race segregation, particularly as they affect the District of Columbia and interstate commerce ; to enforce the Thirteenth, or Anti-Slavery, Amendment of the Constitution by the suppression of peonage; to a national guarantee of civil rights; to secure to all a proportional share in the benefits of public expenditures, including equal facilities in the public schools; to equal opportunities in public office and public service, including the national defense; and to repeal all statutory recognition of race for residents of this country." 135 136 THEAN OPEN LETTER TO ROBERT RUSSA MOTON THE CRISIS hastens to extend to you on your accession to the headship of Tuskegee the assurances of its good will and personal respect. The CRISIS does this all the more willingly because it has to some extent been the mouthpiece of many who have had occasion repeatedly to criticize the words and deeds of your predecessor. It would be a matter of hope and rejoicing if your assumption of new duties could be the beginning of a new era of union and understanding among the various groups of American Negroes. But understanding and cooperation must be based on frank conference and clear knowledge. As a preliminary step to such understanding the CRISIS ventures in this open letter to express to you publicly its hopes and fears. It hopes that the aims of the colored American have become sufficiently clear to admit of no misunderstanding or misstatement. We desire to become American citizens with every right that pertains to citizenship : 1. The right to vote and hold office. 2. Equality before the law. 3. Equal civil rights in all public places, and in all public services. 4. A proportional share in the benefits of all public expenditures. 5. Education according to ability and aptitude. With these rights we correlate our duties as men and citizens—the abolition of poverty, the emancipation of women, the suppression of crime and the overcoming of ignorance. The CRISIS assumes—indeed, it knows—that in these matters you believe substantially, as we do, and that the real differences between us, if there be such, lie in matters of present emphasis and present procedure. CRISIS We assume, without demur, that following the late Booker T. Washington you will place especial emphasis on vocational training, property getting and conciliation of the white South. These are necessary policies, but they have their pitfalls, and against these the CRISIS speaks this warning word: 1. Only the higher and broader training will give any race its ultimate leadership. This Mr. Washington came to realize, and this you must not forget, 2. Individual accumulation of wealth must gradually and inevitably give way to methods of social accumulation and equitable distribution. 3. Finally: Conciliation is wise and proper. But how far shall it go ? It is here that the CRISIS confesses to its deepest solicitude in your case. It cannot but remember its unanswered query of you in the case of the St. Louis luncheon. It has before it the heading of a Rochester paper which gives as your opinion that "from North one gets distorted view of South." And finally, there is the recent case of the Pullman car and your family. The CRISIS will assume in all of these cases that you have not been correctly reported; that you did not voluntarily give up lunching at the St. Louis City Club; that you did not assert that the South was maligned usually at the North, and above all, that you did not say that you had no sympathy with the attempt of members of your family to ride on Pullman cars in the South. The CRISIS knows only too well the way in which Southern newspapers put such sentiments into the mouths of colored leaders; but the point upon which we insist is this: that such atrocious statements cannot be always passed in silence. We do not wish the principal of EDITORIAL 137 Tuskegee to spend his valuable time in answering calumnies and misstatements, but we do believe that when so monstrous a statement is made, as in the case of the Pullman car, something besides silence and acquiescence is called for. We hope to see, therefore, at Tuskegee in the future a carrying out and development of the best of its past work and a continued attempt to come to terms of understanding with the best of the white South; but to these policies we hope to see added a policy of making it clearly understood to the people of this country that Tuskegee does believe in the right to vote; that it does not believe in Jim-Crow cars; that it recognizes the work of the Negro colleges, and that it agrees with Charles Sumner that "Equality of rights is the first of rights." This, then, is the forward step at Tuskegee which the CRISIS and its friends look for under your administration, and it desires to express its earnest hope, and indeed its faith, that you will not disappoint your fellow workers. THE COLORED CHURCHES THE results in the General Conferences of the African M. E. and the A. M. E. Zion churches are on the whole encouraging. The representation of laymen was strong and made itself effective. Determined effort backed, it is said by money, tried to force the election of certain objectionable men in the A . M . E . Conference, and succeeded in keeping the Conference from its larger duties for most of its time. Yet when the election actually came the two men raised to the bishopric represented not the filibusters but, without doubt, the best of the possibilities. On the other hand the severe arraignment of Bishop Jones by the Conference was a vindication of the men who have made a long and sturdy fight. The Zion Conference succeeded in putting some long needed legislation upon the statute books, and injecting new and younger blood into the bishops' council. THE METHODISTS ONE of Bishop Asbury's servants, Harry Hosier, developed into a powerful preacher. The growing Methodist Church for a while welcomed the slaves, but after a generation of experiment, discrimination crept in and in 1796 the first lot of Negroes withdrew, founding the present African M. E. church. In 1820 a second lot withdrew forming the present Zion church. In 1844 the church split on the subject of slavery, and the Southern branch after carrying its slave membership in the gallery for a generation, set them aside in 1870 as the Colored M. E. church. In the Northern M. E. church a colored annual conference was established in 1852, and four years later most of the Negro Methodist churches were segregated in colored annual conferences. In 1860 these conferences were given full power and the system after the war was extended throughout the South. Now comes, in our day, the question of the reunion of the Southern and Northern white Methodists. The Southern Methodists are delightfully frank. They wish a reunion with the Negro- left outside. The Northern Methodists are not as frank. One wing proposed bishops for particular races, but more subtle counsels prevailed, and at the last General Conference a further step was taken so to segregate the colored conferences that their entire separation from the white churches, within the next few years, would be an easy matter. Thus white Methodism leads us toward the Brotherhood of Man! TH E CRISIS LO, THE DUSK-BORN DAUGHTER! By B. HARRISON PEYTON I. T O, my Heart, behold! a girl of modest brown Is gliding down the paths of our town! Clings not round her the aura of the morning-child; For mark, Heart, she came not while Aurora smiled In silver effusion on the lucid air; Her figure is not dawn-pale, nor is her hair Fine-spun of sun-gold into a Phoebean crown! 0 Eyes, she is some quickened bronze, Which transformed to skin of finest texture, Unto the sense as exquisitely responds As any gloss of silk or softness of a plush! But nay, frail Eyes; trust not the groping, blind conjecture! Ah ! tell my Heart by what mutations Could bronze be turned half so ravishingly lush, So ripened into rich refreshing fruit as is this girl? And furthermore, I ask you, Eyes, e'en tho' it were toothed Of ivory or milky-clouded pearl, As preciously cut and delicately smoothed As are her teeth, what mold of bronze—bronze cumbrous and cold— Could make upon my soul, oh! such enthralling seizure As	 do these luxuriant beauties which some would dare hold Were but a darkling blush of shame? II. Ah, no, Heart, 'twas of lowly, peaceful dusk God wrought her, And of benignities that the lofty spheres brought her; She is of Vesper, child and anointed daughter! Look! how all the charms of twilight gather to her frame, And the shades of tropics haunt her lissome shape! Ay, too, lambent stars are twinkling, e'en when noon's aflame; Here her crinkling, night-like tresses the gloaming drape. Soul, gaze her quiet eyes! From what divine skies Did they, with placid allure of dusk, escape— These amber haze-beams that, as if ordained, transfigure, And with soft halos flush her every lovely feature? Bewitched Soul, how they mark her perfect, dusk-born creature! III. Thus veined with angel-gossamers floated down By the eventide, she is become a blessed vision— Verily, O Soul! Soul! a miracle of brown! As closer now she comes, oh! mark each luster Which ripples in a sheen o'er the swarthness that is swirled About her from pale finger-nail to eye-lash thick-curled! Soul, infinitely happy harmonies are Thus bodied by her in tender, gleamy dark! LO, THE DUSK-BORN DAUGHTER! IV. Ay, she carries the dim spirit of the vesper-star; And thence it comes that her sympathies impart To shadow-purpled nightingales the dreaming of her heart Which so elatedly he sings to rapt-hark'ning lark! So breathe, Heart, breathe the fragrances that cluster Round that sweet, peerless bower of her flesh whence she wafts The warm, reposeful shade of the holy palm And such meady dews as flavor lands of southern calm! And drink, Heart! O Heart! drink of Elysian balm Which her elixir-like touch brings in redolent drafts From nightward nectaries that have their place In lunar regions of supernal space! And then, my Heart, let your every vibrant fiber sense The essence, as it were, of oenomel which seems thence To lave its haze on her delicious face, Where is set, like a red-brown kiss, the mouth that quaffs Its flow—oh! blissful flow the nectaries dispense To but her who, by divine right of race, Is twilight vestal, and to eve enchantress-daughter And purest cast of gloam in fluent grace of water! V. God! shall lewd flames count wanton, wind-raked husk This girl whose nature heaves such sacred spells of dusk? Love! 0 true Love! how chaste with cloistral sundown And ways that breathe rosy airs of saintly musk, Oh! she must be, since that her being wears for gown Heav'n's own highness in pure glows of auburn brown! VI. Thus she moves zephyr-like in virgin grace of leisure! And since she is sylphine-imbued with nightfall 'that drowns Earth in ethereal tides of marvelous browns, How meet it is that her feet, O Columbian World, Are given to thread your occidental spread! Why then, mad World, are persecutive shadows thus hurled Before her feet? E'en so, World, behold! tho' meek and demure, Yet she walks in stanch and serene procedure, Unfaltering in her fortitude and gentle state, Towards far horizons where, beaconing, there wait For her more golden triumphs than any sunset has! Ay, her way leads through dread labyrinths of hate, Mid trails of scorn pythonic, and minotaurs of wrath, But like the dusk, she walks above her earthly path! VII. She is some ministrant dove of celestial orders, Or dark-veiled, mist-winged sprite, flown from Hesperian borders And traced of poised cloud-drift and willowed, phantom waters! Up, Heart, and hail her, dusk-ennobled Queen of Daughters! National Association for the A d vancement of THE GREAT LAKES DISTRICT CONFERENCE H E five sessions of the Great Lakes District Conference, held at the invitation of the Cleveland Branch on May 30 and 31, mark a new era in the development of internal solidarity and strength of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Distance has always prohibited many delegates from attending the annual meetings and conferences of the N. A. A. C. P.; but this gathering of representatives from the branches of a small geographical unit proved eminently practicable, and was so thoroughly a success that the delegates unanimously voted to make it a permanent, annual affair. The vice-president of the Cleveland Branch, Mr. F. E. Young, who conceived the idea of the Conference, was assisted in arranging its details by Mrs. Inez Fairfax, Miss Eleanor Alexander, R. K. Moon, and Albert Miles. Nothing had been left undone when the delegates entered the opening session at Antioch Baptist Church on the afternoon of May 30. F. H. Warren, attorney, represented Detroit; Mrs. Delia Fields, Toledo; Miss M . Sula Butler, Springfield; George A. Weaver, Columbus; Miss Jennie Proctor, Pittsburgh; F. E. Young, Mrs. Fairfax, and Miss Alexander, Cleveland, and Miss Kathryn Johnson, field agent, and Roy Nash, national secretary, represented National Headquarters. The first session, presided over by Miss Eleanor Alexander, was addressed particularly to the women who made up the bulk of the afternoon audiences. In the opening paper on "Women's Responsibility in Building up the N. A. A. C. P.," Miss Jennie Proctor, of Pittsburgh, said in part: WOMEN'S RESPONSIBILITY "The N. A. A. C. P., like many other great movements, owes its very existence to a woman; to one who realized that one soul is as precious in the sight of the Creator as another, and seeing one after another of the privileges given us by the Emancipator being abridged, sent forth the call in response to a plea from William English Walling. What 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' did for Harriett Beecher Stowe, the N. A. A. C. P. has done for Mary White Ovington: given her a permanent place in the hearts Colored People of ten millions of our citizens. "Founded by a woman, the responsibility of women in building up the N. A. A. C. P. is as great, if not greater, than that of men because we know, like the women of stricken Belgium, Serbia, and Poland, who suffers most. We know who suffered most when the German host trod down Belgium; we know who suffers most as the armies advance and retreat through Poland; we know who suffers most when the greatest scourge of this nation, race prejudice, tramples our manhood and our womanhood. It is the mother who feels it most when the children come in from school and tell of being insulted, ignored, and humiliated. It is the mother who feels it most when the grown son or daughter, equipped with a good character, with ability and the aspirations of youth, returns home footsore, heartsore, and discouraged, having found the door of opportunity barred against him or her; it is the mother who must mask a sore heart, and with a courageous countenance, encourage her loved ones to try again. It is the woman of the family who must manage on what her loved ones, through limitations which are no fault of their own, are able to earn. "Every victory won by this Association means a lighter burden for the women, the men, and the children. It means protection; it means opportunity. There are five million self-supporting women in the United States, and of these over one million are colored. Why? Would this be the case if our men were given an opportunity to compete in trades requiring skilled labor? Undoubtedly not, for if our men were allowed the opportunity to compete as skilled mechanics and in the business and industrial world, our women would not have to be bread winners. They could be the homemakers they desire to be, devoting their time to the training of their children and the comfort of loved ones. "Consider what every victory gained by this Association means for our women! With segregation defeated we should not always have to live in the most undesirable districts of our cities, districts without proper sanitation, poorly lighted, and with inferior schools for our children. With the 'Jim-Crow' law defeated, we could travel in safety without insult or humiliation. If by strengthening this organization we can help regain the ballot which has been so cunningly taken from our men in many sections of the South, depriving them of a voice in the making of the laws by which they are governed, this will mean the enactment of laws for the protection of our homes, of our women, of our children. Above all else this is worth while. To strengthen the National Association is a duty women owe themselves, one worth our greatest effort. 140 N. A. A. C. P. " 'Let us be Up and Doing While it is Yet Day, for When the Night Cometh no Man Can Work.' " At the close of Miss Proctor's paper there was a lively discussion on Community Problems. TH E PRESS EV. C. H. YOUNG, of Cleveland, spoke on "The Press." "Of any material organization of which  know," Rev. Young said, "the Associated Press comes nearest to being an exact interpretation of that wonderful verse of scripture, 'And God said let there be light, and there was light.' But the crux of the thing is that so often, when it comes to the Negro, this great light is bedimmed when the splendid achievements of the race are to be seen, although exceptionally bright when the Negro's mishaps are discovered. "The Associated Press seemingly is the most assiduous enemy that the race has today. Our errors, which are far too many, it advertises in conspicuous display; and our virtues, which are too few, it maligns and hoots; so that now we are simply tolerated as undesirable citizens, a single indiscreet act of whom may at any time plunge us into all the horrors of massacre, pillige and ruin. "In the days of Henry Ward Beecher, Charles Sumner, and others, when America was not afflicted with money-mania, the pulpit was the black man's friend, and to a large degree was the mouthpiece of public opinion. She aroused public conscience and moulded public sentiment; and when she thundered her voice against the Sinais of sin, and hurled her Philippics at wrong and oppression, the nation trembled and the pillars of human slavery tottered and cracked. But alas, today the American pulpit on the question of oppressions and wrongs to ten million consecrated American citizens, is as silent as the tomb. And so, that being the fact, the press of America has stepped to the front—and assumed the right to speak for us—not, however, to champion our rights and privileges, but to desecrate them and trample them under their unhallowed feet. It is she who now stirs up and moulds public opinion. There seems to be a concerted plan of activity, as far as possible, on the part of the press to magnify and emphasize the weaknesses and failures of the Negro, and to minimize and touch lightly his strong points and successes. "Undoubtedly its motive is to browbeat the Negro into a cringing submission of conceded inferiority. They believe that even the thoughtful, aspiring, self-respecting Negroes will be so stung, and chafed, and humiliated by their constant nagging that all incentives to progress will be obliterated, all aspirations of the soul demolished, and their faculties of thought and reason be so crushed and benumbed that they will acquiesce, give up the fight, and settle down to a life of pariah or a state of semi-slavery. And thus you see that the greatest enemy before the American Negro in the Twentieth Century is the Associated Press. "How shall we overcome this enemy? This is the one absorbing question, and a touch of the Solomonic wisdom is necessary to answer it. The press of America represents millions of dollars. There are millions in it, and millions must be gotten out of it; and the owners thereof are going to see to it that nothing shall grace the columns of their press that does not look like dollars and cents. The problem of the press is to make it pay. Chester K. Lord, a former Managing Editor of a leading New York journal, is quoted as having said, 'Every editor knows that the more details of sin, vice and crime you cram into a newspaper, the more copies of the newspaper will be sold. To give the people what they want is the greatest temptation of the editor.' "With a slight degree of modification, it may be said of the press as was one time said of a corporation, 'It is soulless,' and therefore, being without a soul, you cannot appeal to its psychological nature. It is devoid of a heart, and hence it has no sense of righteousness and truth; so thus you cannot touch its ethical nature. But it has a head, body, and feet. It knows everything, takes in anything, and goes everywhere; and in order to get a hearing from, and have a voice in this wonderful organ of intelligence, you have got to be as wise as a serpent, and as harmless as a dove. Observation, information and experi ence give us the right to offer a few suggestions for consideration: "First, let the Press Committee of the Association be composed of a set of thoughtful, cool-headed, conscientious members. This committee should be the depository of all news of the Association intended for publication. It should be the speaker, through the press, for the Association. Not every Tom and Harry should rush off and assume to speak for the Association through the press. As a race our cause has suffered and our interests been greatly jeopardized by those who have much more gab than brains, and much less sense than brass, rushing into print, speaking unauthorized for the race; and hence, when the legitimate spokesmen of the race resort to these great organs of information to give out a message to the world, what might be considered as our space has already been utilized and our matter is shut out. This committee should personally acquaint itself with the managing editors so that they will know who it is, what it represents, and the import of its message. "This committee should tender in person matters touching the race for publication. The science of approach is invaluable here. This committee should know first, what it 142 THE wants to say. It should be in clear, terse English. And next, it should be said in a way that is interesting and convincing. The art of condensation is a necessary qualification of the members of this committee. "We also suggest that while we are fighting righteously for a hearing of our cause through the Associated Press, we ourselves should publish a small sheet for information, to be known as the official organ of the local Branch. Let it be a paper, say about 9% by 6, the same to be published every once in a while; especially when the Branch has a special message for the public and is doing something practical." The chief paper of the second afternoon's conference was by attorney Harry E. Davis, of Cleveland, on "The Negro's Opportunity in the Industrial Fields of the North." INDUSTRIAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE NORTH "While my subject is limited to Cleveland, yet what I have to say will apply with equal force to practically all of the cities in this conference district. For Cleveland is typical of the communities represented in this district, and the scope of this paper is broad enough to apply with equal force to all of them. "Today we are witnesses of a great industrial boom unparalleled in the history of the city. The greatest factor in this is the enormous demand created by the war which is literally scouring the world for supplies of munitions and materials to feed its insatiate appetite. Nearly every factory here which had any facilities for making any of the required supplies has been drawn into the field by the inducement of large profits and quick returns. "This might have no bearing on our topic if it were not for the great demand for common and skilled labor which the situation has created. And coupled with this labor demand comes an almost total extinction of the sources which hitherto have supplied the labor market of this country. For the war has caused a great falling off in foreign immigration, and has completely restrained the annual influx from southern Europe which previously supplied most of our common labor. "Of course, this industrial boom is to a great extent only temporary in its nature, for the demand will end with the war, and the war must end soon. But I believe the dearth in the labor market is of a more permanent nature, and will continue for some years in the future. For when the war ends the governments of Europe will need all their labor to repair and rebuild the waste and wreckage caused by it, and they will take even drastic steps to keep this supply at home. And in this peculiar situation is a great industrial opportunity for the Negro in Cleveland, and I would emphasize the fact that the opportunity is here now, a present, existing fact outside of the realm of speculation. CRISIS "The extent of the labor demand is evidenced by very striking symptoms. Organized labor was not slow to see its chance, and we have seen a general demand for high wages, shorter hours and better working conditions nearly all of which have been granted by the helpless employer. Then too, the high wage paid is another indication of the demand. Common labor now asks and gets $3.00 per day and sometimes even more. Also the reports from employment agencies, both state and private, give convincing testimony of the scarcity of labor. "For the first time in our memory we see the spectacle of employers actually appealing to our churches, literally combing the highways of the colored district, and even sending agents South to bring to them colored workmen. "This leads me to say that there is no prejudice in a genuine economic demand and it knows no color line. When employers organize and hold public meetings in our churches in order to present an invitation for employment, it means that they mean business. They are not trying to sell stock, or to promote 'blue sky' enterprises at your expense. For the first time you are really wanted and the old excuse of 'not wanted' no longer obtains. "The value of this opportunity is almost beyond computation. If it is grasped while it is here and held, it means the opening of practically a new field to almost an unlimited extent. Here is the opportunity to learn a great variety of mechanical trades so long advocated by our foremost exponent of industrial education, the late Dr. Washington. Here is an opportunity for the colored workmen to occupy and intrench himself in an advantageous and strategic position, and opportunity to become a real industrial factor in the community. Once intrenched I believe he will continue to grow in favor with the employer who cannot fail to appreciate the value of a vigorous laboring class, docile, congenial and tractable— not given to strikes, lockouts and industrial terrorism. "Here too is an opportunity .to secure better treatment and fairer consideration by organized labor. The colored workmen will then be recognized as 'competitors, who by reason of sheer numerical strength, if nothing else, must be absorbed into the union fold, and accorded their proper rights and protection not only industrially, but politically. "And added to this would be the advantage of having in our midst a high wage earning class who in due time would become home owners with all the moral and material value which property ownership brings in its wake. Further, the contact with white labor on equal terms is bound to create a better feeling which ought to allay considerable of the prejudice which comes from this element. "It is to be deplored that here, and prob ably no place else, in this district, we have N. A. A. C. P. no agency which can take advantage of this situation by helping to supply this demand. As already pointed out, the condition has created a considerable emigration from the South, a situation which may be fraught with great possibilities for evil to our several communities. This new element coming into our cities will be hard to adjust and assimilate to our ideals and methods of living. We have no adequate machinery for bringing this about. Our housing facilities are none too large at present, and our social facilities for meeting this new element are meagre. In the event that the present era of prosperity is followed by an industrial depression it might mean a large idle class in our midst which would rapidly degenerate into a dangerous criminal element. "This organization is perhaps not adapted to meet the new situation fully, but we should not be blind or idle in the face of a great opportunity which bulks large upon our future welfare. We can at least acquire and circulate information as to local conditions so that false impressions will not go out or advantages painted in too bright colors to those who may be now happily situated. We can help to create and establish agencies for securing and preserving contact with any new element, if it comes in numbers, so that they will be directed along proper social channels, and avoid the evils existing in all large cities. In this, of course, our churches must play a large part, but they cannot do it all, and to successfully cope with the situation requires the co-operation of all our energies. "One thing we can do in connection with other organizations is to make the proper representation to large employers to dissuade them from scouring the country to attract labor without regard to character and fitness. This can be done in such a way as to greatly neutralize any prospective danger, and also without giving offense to any one. We are not afraid of any increase in a substantial working population, but our communities in the North have, by years of effort, built up a local standing and prestige which we cannot suffer to be impaired." Harry Davis was followed by Mr. D. J. Campbell, Superintendent of the Ferro Machine and Foundry Company, who told vividly some of the difficulties employers have in taking on colored labor, how the class that is being imported from the South arrive absolutely broke, and have to be given daily advances to meet their board bills, and how one shift handling heavy weights in the awful heat of the blast furnaces is too frequently the end of their service. When he tried to shift the burden of caring for the Southern influx, which is being dumped on the community by the trainful, to the Cleveland colored community, asking that they see that men are fitted to their jobs, that credit is extended to them by lodging houses, etc., it was quickly pointed out that the Conference considered the proper care and placing of this new factor in the labor market as very much the proper concern of the employers. The final paper of the second afternoon session was one by Mrs. Johnson Farrar on "How to Make the Branches Efficient," which lack of space does not permit us to quote. THE EVENING SESSIONS THE two evening sessions were of a more general nature, and addressed to large audiences which filled the Antioch Baptist and St. John's A. M. E. Churches. On behalf of the Mayor of Cleveland, Lamar T. Beeman, Director of Public Welfare, welcomed the delegates at the Memorial Day meeting. He was followed by Colonel Myron T. Herrick, ex-Governor of Ohio, and formerly Ambassador to France, who said in part: "I do not speak to you as members of any race, but as members of this composite nation. The one word 'servitude' in the Constitution was the great iniquity upon which this nation was founded. But just as that was wiped out, as Fred Douglass said, 'by the working out of inscrutable providence,' as enlightenment finally made servitude impossible, so the existing prejudices are bound to disappear before enlightenment. The fortitude, the God fearing attitude, the dignity of colored people is the greatest guarantee of this. No brighter record has ever been put on the pages of history than the achievements of colored people since the Civil War. And in this crisis, when we are taking stock of our elements of strength, when the hope of civilization seems to rest on America, when we are integrating our forces for some great, dimly-seen mission, the nation can recall with deep gratitude that there is one large element in her population of which there has never been the faintest doubt of loyalty; there is one race of which not one member will be disloyal to America in any crisis. The time will come when we shall be just as ashamed of the wrongs done this people to-day as we are that they were once slaves." At the second evening session, at which Charles W . Chesnutt presided, Kathryn Johnson, field agent for the National Association, spoke on "Segregation"; and Roy Nash, national secretary, talked on "The Growing Southern Sentiment Against Lynching." THE PERMANENT ORGANIZATION of fully as much importance as the open meetings was an executive session of the delegates at which they resolved to make a permanent organization of the 144 THE Great Lakes District Conference, meeting annually on Decoration Day. For the ensuing year F. H. Warren, of Detroit, was elected district chairman, Rev. H . C. Bailey, of Cleveland, vice-chairman; Miss Jennie Proctor, of Pittsburg, secretary-treasurer, and Mrs. Delia Fields, of Toledo, district delegate to the annual conference of the National Association. At the meeting in 1917, which will be held in Detroit, each branch in the district (the districts will be CRISIS determined by National Headquarters) will be entitled to one delegate for each one hundred paid-up members, or fraction thereof; and National Headquarters will be entitled to one or more accredited delegates. The final action of the Conference was the passing of a statement calling the attention of the political conventions to the problems with which the Conference was concerned. SHAKESPEARE IN AFRICA By ALICE WERNER H E last few weeks have proved to the full—were there any need of proof— the hold which Shakespeare has on every civilized nation. But it is interesting to note how far his influence has extended be yond the bounds of the civilized and literate world. It is easy, however, to make mistakes on this subject. Many of Shakespeare's plots are based on folk-tales which had assumed literary form in Italy, and may either have come ultimately from India, or have existed independently in various parts of the world. These stories may even now be current in places where Shakespeare is quite unknown. For example, the germ of King Lear is to be found in the story of "Catskin," which seems to exist all over Europe and is much older than the ballad usually quoted as the source of the tragedy. A version of this story was collected many years ago by a missionary among the Namaqua Hottentots. Another is current in Dutch-speaking South Africa, under the name of "Velkappi" ("Skin-cap"). Whichever of these is borrowed from the other, neither is likely to be derived from Shakespeare. I have a Swahili version of the "Merchant of Venice," which was written out by a native Christian at Ngao on the Tana (British East Africa). He said he had heard it from an Indian on the coast; he did not know where the Indian had got it, whether from a European or out of one of his own books; he thought the latter. Of course, it is impossible to tell whether the story was not transmitted from some Euro pean source, but it is at least equally pos sible that it came direct from India—the more so, as there is no allusion to the epi sode of the Caskets. The story of the usurer and the pound of flesh seems to have come from the East to Europe through the Crusades; it is found in Gesta Romantrum, as well as in the Pecorone of Ser Giovanni, whence Shakespeare is sup posed to have obtained it. But there would be nothing surprising, in these days, if Shakespeare's actual plots filtered down into African tradition and became a part of current folk-lore. Some of them are related in one of the Swahili school-books published by the Universities Mission at Zanzibar. This, with people whose literary instinct (which, after all, resolves itself into the love for hearing and telling stories) is not fed by newspapers, novelettes or the stage, means more than one might think. In South Africa the native readers of English are a large and continually increasing body, and every one of these starts a lengthening chain of tradition. Those to whom a story has been read or related pass it on, and old chiefs who have never learned their letters, may listen to it with avidity in the bwalo of distant villages far beyond the Zambezi. THE BASEBALL A n educated native told me that when he began to read Shakespeare he was struck by the number of sayings which, hearing them quoted by public speakers, he had hitherto taken for English proverbs. The first play he read was the "Merchant of Venice," and the story, when he related it, was speedily passed on and eagerly discussed. People do not seem to have looked on it as fiction, or realized that it belonged to a past day. More than one man thought he had identified some of the characters as persons then living in South Africa, and the narrator was called on to decide between the rival claims of at least three original Shylocks. On another occasion the question came up in a chief's court, who was "the white man who spoke so well"—the particular words which excited such admiration being: "When beggars die, there are no comets seen, "The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes"— quoted in a native paper apropos of the deaths of King Edward and two prominent Bechwana chiefs in the comet year, 1910. The answer given by one of the chiefs present is worth recording: "His name was William Tsikinya-Chaka" ("Shake the Sword"). Professor Gollancz's "Book of Homage to Shakespeare" contains a tribute in Bechwana, and it is much to be regretted that another, in the Xosa language from the pen of Mr. Bud-Mbelle, author of the "Kafir Scholar's Companion," did not arrive in time for insertion. In one of his essays M . Arnold van Gennep has discussed in a very striking way the interaction of the collective imagination from which spring folk-tale, myth and legend, and the consciousness of the individual artist. Neither is quite independent of the other. Shakespeare gathered up and wrought into imperishable form the material gradually prepared by the folk-mind through uncounted generations. Now we find his works dropping like seed into the virgin soil of the Bantu race—the form remaining a prized possession of the English-speakers, the content passing on to enrich the floating mass of tradition in those wonderful, melodious languages whose future possibilities some of us just dimly apprehend. And at some time, which no human insight can forecast—for the Spirit bloweth where it listeth—the formless mass will crystallize, and "Shakespeare and his mates" will be to Africa what Homer and Sophocles were to the European Renaissance. THE BASEBALL A STORY By BENJAMIN BRAWLEY L L his life Lias had been used to a coarse bill of fare and a scanty wardrobe, but when it seemed that he must give up the narrow margin of pleasure that made life bearable he thought it was time to do something radical. Why should he be unhappy? What had he to do with ambitions, he, an ordinary Negro boy in the uplands of South Carolina? As far back as he could remember his father had lived like other tenants on the land of Cooper, the white man who owned half the county. Why should he not be willing some day to settle down and do the same? Something of all this he was thinking tonight. He had called a meeting of his baseball team at the home of Ed Ellington, not far from the little country schoolhouse. Somehow the boys liked to come to Ed's. Old man Ellington was different from the other men around Pineville. He owned his land and did not have to work on shares with Cooper; and although he himself was notoriously close-fisted things somehow seemed just a little more free around his home than elsewhere. Lias had asked the boys to come together in order that he might collect the dollar and a quarter necessary for the purchase of 146 THE the ball that he was to use in the game with Jonesboro the next Saturday. As captain of the home team he would have to furnish the one new ball to be used in the game. One by one the husky fellows arrived. It was too warm to go indoors so they sat on the benches and old chairs in front of the house. Here was Sid Samuels, the pitcher, a tall, young man who seemed to suffer from lack of cultivation, and who had already developed a round shoulder. Then there was Ben Waters, the first base, immense in physique, but with a forehead that too soon sloped backward from his eyes; and Ed Ellington, the second base, a pleasant-looking young fellow with a face of the utmost frankness. Ned Jackson, the short stop, was a squatty little creature with bow-legs. Bud Jennings, the third base, had great, thick lips, and still bore the marks of a recent fight down by the railroad one night when he was drunk. Jim Moses, the left fielder, was tall and agile, with a step as light as that of a cat. The other fielders, the Stevens brothers, arrived late. They were always late. They lived a good distance away. Some people said that the two fellows were just naturally slow and shiftless, but at any rate the boys had learned to make allowance for them. Until Lias began to talk business the conversation was very merry. There was the big meeting at Silver Creek last Sunday, and the game the next Saturday, to say nothing of the girls. A peculiar hush, however, fell on the crowd when Lias passed the hat and asked each man for fifteen cents. After all he could hope at this rate to collect only one dollar and thirty-five cents. He did not yet know what he would do about his wornout catcher's mit. The hat brought back sixty-five cents. Each man declared half sullenly, half shamefacedly, that he did not have any money. Lias had been in pretty good humor all the evening. His mood of depression had vanished in the presence of the other boys. Especially did he remind Samuels of the previous performances of their famous battery. When the hat came back to him, however, the silence that ensued for a moment was embarrassing. Then the captain arose to speak. "Men," said he, "what's de matter? Why CRISIS can't you gi' me a dollar an' a quarter for a baseball? We all wo'ks hard. I got up dis mornin' at sunup an' wo'ked till sundown, an' eve'y one o' you done de same. Yet when I call you here an' asks you for money for a baseball, you all say you ain't got it, an' I know you ain't got it. Sum-pun's wrong." He walked home that night with Jennings. He did not have much to do with him, because he was a good deal older than the other boys, but tonight the man was going his way, and the two fell in together. For some time Lias walked on in silence. Then he suddenly blurted out something about the money for the baseball. "Well, Lias, we is down, you know," said Jennings. "We is down, an' w'e can't hope to do much better." The next day the boy worked in the field where the sun, not yet at its zenith, seemed to blaze like a ball of fire. The hot waves of air danced before him as he looked away in the distance at the yellowing corn. What did it all mean anyway? Why should he be working on and on, getting nowhere? What good had come of it so far? Where would he be next year at this season of the year but right here, doing the same work over again, never a bit better off, and without even the price of a baseball. Who was Cooper, anyway, that he should be slaving for him in this fashion? Why couldn't the boys, nine hard-working fellows, get at least enough money for one baseball? Why did they not have just a little more to spare? It was bad enough not to have much of a house to live in, and to eat bacon and corn-bread every day, but if one could not even buy a baseball, why, life was hardly worth living. Then it was that Lias resolved to run away. At dinner he was more than usually patient. Andy turned his cup of water over on the oilcloth as usual; Mattie was cross; and Baby Jim threw at him across the table great hunks of cornbread mixed with molasses; but he held little sister Betty on his knee a long time, and then went back to work. "Is you feelin' well, Lias?" asked Mandy, his mother, whose face had somehow never looked so careworn. THE BASEBALL "Yes, I'm feelin' all right," replied Lias, with a twinge of conscience, avoiding Mandy's glance. But for him night was long in coming. He knew where to find the old brown satchel that his father had sometimes used in his trips to town; that would more than hold all he had. If only that sun would go down! It had been in the same spot for more than two hours. In the dead of night he was still awake. Just across the hall, however, his father was emitting sounds that told that he at least was far away in the land of dreams. It was hard to leave Ma ; and he had never known that he loved Betty and Jim so tenderly. Even Andy, who seemed born but to meddle .with his things and get in the way, was dear to him after all. But it was useless for them all to stay there and die. Perhaps if he got away he might become a rich man and help them some day. He might even go to school! He looked out of the window. Suddenly the shrill song of a cricket broke forth upon the quiet of the night. He arose and put on the clothes he had worn all day. Then he threw into the satchel the suit he wore on Sundays, and his ties, and the little reader he had last used in school; and he went forth into the hall. This was the only home he had ever known, and he was turning his back on it! He was doing so deliberately. The front door creaked slightly on its hinges. Lias started, but quickly recovered himself. Moonlight floating over bolls of cotton, the road that led on to the town, and the trees that were to him as friends, met his gaze as he looked forth into the summer night. "Is you leavin' us, Lias?" asked Mandy, only three feet away from him. The boy gave a deep sigh. His hand fell off the door knob. "Yes, I'm goin'. I can't stand it no longer." "Where you gwine, Lias?" "To Columbia, I s'pose," continued the boy doggedly. "I'm tired o' this way o' livin'. I don't want to work for Cooper no more. Eve'ything you want, go to de white man. If I wants a house, go to de white man; if I wants to marry, go to de white man; want sumpun t' eat, go to de white man. I done had enough of it." "That's so," said Mandy thoughtfully. "There ain't nothin' in it for me," Lias went on. "There ain't nothin' in it for none of us. I said to myse'f, it'd be better if Pa managed better, but he ain't never goin' to manage no better. He can't. An ' las' night I asked de boys on de team for fifteen cents for a baseball, an' dey ain't had it. All of us is down. I don't want to leave you an' de child'en, but dere ain't no use for us all to stay here an' die." "That's true," said Mandy slowy, "I guess you better go." "You see," she continued, "it's always been a sort o' uphill climb wid us. Your Pa never did manage well. I tol' him years ago dat dere wa'n't no use tryin' to make it wid Cooper, but he wouldn't hear to it. He's always gittin' mo' an' mo' behin'. I never was used to wo'kin' in de fiel's; my own mother tried to give me half_way decent raisin'. But after a while I took my row 'long wid de res'. I was always glad to see you comin' on ahead o' de other chillun. It seem to gi' me hope somehow. Den dere was dat time when your Pa got in dat fight down by de railroad an' hurt a man an' went to de gang for three months. Dat was de wors' of all for Mattie came while he was away. The Lord he'ped me wid it all somehow. 'Some day Lias will be a man,' I said, but you's mos' grown now, an' as you say, dere ain't nothin' here for you. You better go." Mandy paused a moment. "I used to say to myse'f," she went on, "dat I wanted to see you make a fine man o' yourse'f, go off to school an' all dat sort o' thing. But we don't seem to git nowhere. Perhaps you better go an' try to make it for yourse'f." The boy's gaze was blurred now. A great tear stole down his cheek. "No," he said, "I'm not goin'." Then the big fellow leaned on the bosom of the little woman and cried like the baby he had been eighteen years before. THE CRISIS ADVERTISER Figure It Out For Yourself! If you are an active lodge member you spend at least twenty-four hours in each year attending your lodge. If you are in more than one—most men are—j'ou spend the equivalent of three whole working days in the lodge room within a year. If you are an occasional attendant at one or more you put in at least twelve hours attending meetings. Making liberal allowances your year's cost works out this way: Time spent attending meetings $2.00 Car fare 1.20 Monthly dues @ 50 cents 6.00 Endowment dues (average) 3.00 Annual taxes .50 Special death assessments (average) 1.00 Total $1370 The average secret order policy is rarely more than $300.00 as a maximum. It averages $250.00 and starts with $50.00 payable the first year, maturing only after five years. During this time, you are paying for full protection and getting onlyone-fifth the first year, two-fifths the second, and so on. In five years, you have paid $68.50. If you get behind for three months, you are dropped; and to be reinstated you must start in as a new member. Contrast this with old-line legal reserve life insurance : Your policy calls for, say, $500.00 on the Whole Life Plan. It is in full force the minute it is placed in your hands. If you die next day, the whole amount of the policy is paid to your beneficiary. You get from the beginning all the protection you pay for. At age 25 the premium is $10.85 a year; at age 30, $12.25 a year; at age 35, $14.05 a year. At the last age you pay in five years a total of $70.25. If at the end of that time you desire to quit, we will, as a matter of contract, give you $32.00 cash for the surrender of the policy, and your five years' insurance has cost only $38.25. Or, we will give you a paid-up policy for $64.00, on which you never have to pay another cent. Or, we will extend your $500.00 policy for five years and ten months without any charge to you. These values increase every year and they are all in the policy. There are no meetings to attend; no long journey to and from lodges; no sitting" in cold halls in winter or poorly ventilated sweat boxes in summer. If you change your residence, it makes no difference ; for there is no starting over again, as in the lodge, when you move from one state to another. From the standpoint of low cost, convenience, increased value, incomparable safety, a FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR WHOLE LIFE POLICY in STANDARD LIFE beats all the secret order endowments you can find.

Berwick Sayers HIS LIFE AND LETTERS ILLUSTRATED AMUEL COLERIDGE-TAYLOR, the first composer of classic music to come from the colored races, was born in London forty years ago. His genius asserted itself at the early age of six when, as one of his admirers describes it, he was found "holding a very small-sized violin in one hand, and playing at marbles with the other." The real discovery was, however, made by his guardian, friend, and benefactor, Colonel Herbert, of the Queen's Regiment. At thirteen, he was a brilliant solo violinist. Entering the Royal College of Music in 1890, three years later, he won an open scholarship for composition. His progress was marked by such landmarks as "Hiawatha's Wedding Feast," known the world over, "Herod," "Ulysses," "Nero," "Faust," "Endymion's Dream," " A Tale of Old Japan," "Othello." The tribute we pay to the darker races of the world who have produced artists, thinkers, and composers is notorious by its absence. Proud of his race, it was indeed characteristic of the sturdy, honest nature of Coleridge-Taylor that he never sought to keep in the background his Negro origin, but, on the contrary, was thoroughly proud of it and of his own position. Of the fascination the tale of his life holds for a biographer, it is needless to speak. Mr. Berwick Sayers has brought to his loving task an enthusiasm which makes of his volume charming reading. Alfred Noyes, in the poem entitled "Samuel Coleridge-Taylor," writes: The spark that falls from heaven, not oft on earth, To human hearts its vital splendor gives; His was the simple, true, immortal birth! Scholars compose; but THIS MAN'S MUSIC LIVES. Price, $2.25.
