heads and look freeWhere men dare not seek what they were born for lifeWhere many men work and starveand many work and turn into cabbagesand many steal and turn into ratsand a few own the land and turn into hogsWhere nature is not as important as lawWhere law is cause rather than effectWhere religion is faith rather than affirmationWhere love is never as strong as thingsWhere age is decay rather than more lifeWhere art is encouraged but not recognizedWhere revolt is the strongest of emotions and the weakest of actionsWhat do you call this strange place where it is immoral to take life deeplyand moral to be a half thingWhere it is beautiful to have theories of livingand ugly to apply themCopyright1915by Margaret CAnderson Where it is right to dabble and wrong to realizeWhere ignorance is a virtue and knowledge a crimeWhere nature is obscenity and man s abuse of it purityWhere philistinism is a habit and intellectual groping afad Where reputation is more vital than characterWhere sociability is a goal instead of a viceWhere indirection is known as unselfishness and self direction as egotismWhere thinking is only a sort of autistic stammeringWhere genius being

comes only when one has struggled beyond the need of itsex is known as the greatest human experienceand experiencein sex as the greatest human sinWhere religion is known to be an unfoldingbut experience in unfolding looked upon as irreligiousWhat do you call this fantastic place where age that is weak rules youth that is strongWhere parents prescribe life for children they cannot understandWhere politicians and prostitutes and police and the press are despised but honored and great spirits are suspected of greatness but feared and cast outWhere nations go to war for things they do not believe in and individuals will not go to revolution for things they do believe inWhere those who know the rottenness in Denmark cannot think through to what caused itWhere birds that fly are put into cages and men who soar are put into jailsWhat do you call this incredible place where men go inch by inch to death in jailsWhere they cease to hear and see and feel and smell and talk and walk and sing and sleep and work and play and think and benot by order of gods or monsters but by order of men What do you call a place where those who must cease to be are richer than those who areWhat do you call this awful place where every great spirit walks not only in rebellion and misunderstanding and isolation but in persecution Where there are no heroes to make an end of horrorsWhere even to live outdoors cannot clean menWhere there is no imagination and no faithWhere there is no silenceDo you call it an asylum of crazed beings who annihilate each otherNot at allYou call it the

Little Review Moods BEN HECHT I have heard the water beasts roaring in the nightLeaping and howlingStung to madness by the tempest s mightI have seen them splintering their heads in a furious racePlunging through the bellowing gloom With a boom boom boomAnd from each torn face I have watched their white blood Sweeping in a foam across the nightI have heard the water beasts snarling at the wild beating blows Of the strong handed winds that tore them into rows And churned their entrails into hissing snowsThe water is a restless smile soft as a woman s hairAt noon it closes its vast blue eye and falls asleepAt night as the swooning day gives birthThe water is an opal glittering On the gnarled black fist of the earthI have heard the water purring in the sun with its blue back archedAnd have seen the drowsy water beasts rising from their bedsI have heard them chant as they formed and marched With their green peaked hoods tipping rakish on their headsThe water is frozenUnder its stiffened bosom The beasts run blindly to and fro And rising from beneath Crunch one another with their frozen teethIt burnssoul is like waterThe Little Review Sorrow The night is a black poppymoon

LEVINGTON COMFORT AMERICAN novelist who wanted salesand who was willing to sacrifice all but the core of his character to get salesfound himself recently in a challenging situationAs he expressed it Along about page two hundred in the copy of the novel I am onthe woman s soul wakes upA woman s novel I asked Meant to be said he Study of a woman all throughBegins as a little girl differentyou know sensitivedoes a whole lot of thinking that her family doesn t followTries to tellem at firstbut finds herself in badThen keeps quiet for years putting on power and beauty in the good old way of bumps and misunderstandingShe s pure white fire presently body and brain something else asleepShe wants to be a motherbut the ghastly sordidness of the love stories of her sisters to this enactmentfrightens her from men and marriage as the world conducts itI follow you said I WellI m not going to do the novel here for you he added You wouldn t think there was a ray of light in it from this kind of tellingA man who spends five months of his best hours of life in telling a storycan t do it over in ten minutes and drive a machine at the same timeWe re getting out of the crowdWhat does the girl do I asked Wellshe wanted a little baby was ready to die for itbut had her own ideas of what the father should beA million married women have thought the same thing here in America pricked the obscene sham of the whole business but too lateMoreover they re the best women we ve gotThere are He actually shook the hat off his head back into the seat at this point There are some young women coming up into maturity here in America God blessem who are almost brave enough to set out on the Quest for the Father of the baby that haunts them to be bornThat s what she did He was a young man doing his own kind of work doctoring among the poorlet us saymainly for nothing killing himself among men and women and babies living on next to nothingbut having a half divine kind of madness to lift the worldShe saw himYou can picture thatThey were two to make one and a thirdShe knewThere was a gold light about his head for her eyesSome of his poor had seen itThe young man himself didn t know itand the world missed it altogether She went to himIt s cruel to put it this wayI m not saying anything about the writing or about what happenedbut the scene 8 The Little Review as it came to me was the finest thing I ever sawWe always fall down in the handlingyou know I did it the best I couldNoI m not going to tell you what happenedOnly this A little afterward along about page two hundred of the copy her soul woke upWhy notin God s name He glanced quickly at me as a man does from aheadwhen his car is pressing the limit Ever have a book fail he asked Seven said IHe cleared his throat and the kindest smile came into his eyes They tell me at my publisher s that I slowed up my last book badlyby taking a woman s soul out for an airing just a little invalid kind of a soultooSouls don t wake up in American novels any moreYou can t do much more in print nowadays than you can do on canvas I mean movie canvasOf courseyou can paint soulbut you can t photograph it that s the pointThe movies have put imagination to deathWe have to competeYou can t see a soul without imagination or some sort of madnessand the good people who want imagination in their novels don t buyemThey rent or borrowIt s the crowds that go to the movies that have bright colored strings of American novelsas the product runs on their shelves little shiny varnished shelves red carpets painted birds on the lampshades and callers in the eveningsThere was a good silence Do you know he said presently I ve about come to the conclusion that a novel must play altogether on sensuous tissue to catch the crowdLook at the big movie pictures the actors make love like painted animalsI m not humorous or ironicalIt s a big problem to me Whyyou can t touch the hem of the garment of a real love story until you are off the sensuous I offered The Quest only begins thereI m not averse to thatIt belongs in partWe are sensuous beingsin partBut I am averse to letting it contain allWhythe real glow comes to a romance when a woman s soul wakes upThere s a hotter fire than that which glows blood redI know he said quickly I knowThat blood red stuff is the cheapest thing in the worldbut that s where the great thing called human interest livesI m sure of this story until her soul wakes upShe stirs in her sleepand I see a giantess ahead the kind of woman who could whistle to me or to you and we d follow her out dazed by the draw of herThey are in the worldI reckon souls do wake up but I can feel the public dropping off every page after two hundred like chilled beesdropping off page by page and the old familiar battle aheadI can feel that tight look about the eyes again The Little Review 9Are you going to put her soul back to sleep I askedas we turned again into the crowdI wasn t the least lordly in this questionI knew his struggleand something of the markettooI was thinking of tradesmen how easy it is to be a tradesman in facthow difficult it is to be otherwise when the very passion of the racial soul moves in the midst of trade She s beautiful even asleep he said I m afraid I ll have to give her somethingI m building a houseShe s in the comprehension of the little varnished shelves asleepDoesn t a tight look come about the eyes from much use of that sort of anaesthetic I asked Let s get a drink he answered A fairly widespread intellectual movementthough it be madnesshas a profound and almost sacred significancePrimitive races believe that madmen are the voice of GodAs much might be said of artistsTheir madness is often wiser than the average wisdomRomain Rolland10 The Little Review Poems MAXWELL

PoetryAMY LOWELL HAT a melancholy thing it is to have to admit that one of our national traits so often interferes with our appreciatioin of the fine artsand therefore with the pleasure and profit to be derived from them As a nationwe are dreadfully impressed by noiseThe loud and compellingeven if the blatantis sure to attract our attentionIt is as though we were tone deaf to all instruments save those of percussionand colour blind to all except the primary coloursThis is a particularly unsatisfactory conditionas we are really of a very welcoming temperWe are as anxious to make friends in art as in lifeWe have no quarrel with originality on the contraryit is decidedly pleasing to usBut our sympathies are bounded by our capacitiesand our capacities are to a great extent limited to the perception of loud tones and crude coloursTo teach the public to hear semi tones and see half shadesperhaps that is one of the functions of the Imagist poetsI suppose it is this preoccupation with what Walter Scott used to callthe bigbow wow style which has kept Richard Aldington s work from being as well understood here as it is in EnglandThe very delicacy of it its elusivenessin which suggestions appear and disappear like a blowing mistits faintgradually changing colourall these things confuse the average American poetry loverWhile a few people find in MrAldington s work poetry of a most exquisite and stimulating kindthe great mass of readers turn away bewilderedThis is inconceivable to meHow is it that we do not notice that a man is standing beside us unless he digs us in the ribs with an aggressive elbowOur own country womanwho writes under the pen name of HD has had to contend with much of the same partial understandingand it remained for an EnglishmanMrAldington himselfto write an explanation and appreciation of her work in an American magazine this magazineIt is time that an American should explain to her countrymen the work of the Englishmanwho is Richard AldingtonWater and poetry have a quality in commonThey both have a way of seeping seepingand without apparent flowarrivingWe are constantly finding fault with American publishers for permitting English firms to bring out the first books of our authors it is to the honour of America that Richard Aldington s first book is to appear in the autumnwith the imprint of an American houseIndeedin speaking of the non understanding of the mass of American readers and reviewersI must add the paradox that the minority here is quicker to perceive excellence than the people of any other countryIt is The Little Review our own magazine Poetrywith its far seeing and daring editorwho first introduced MrAldington to a considerable publicand her lead was quickly followed by THE LITTLE REVIEWan American firmthe Boni sprinted a number of his poems in an Anthology Des Imagistesand another American firmMessrsHoughton Mifflinprinted others in Some Imagist PoetsSo MrAldington s work has seeped little by little to where we can look at it as a reflecting lakeMore sputtering brooks of poetry have brawled away and disappearedbut MrAldington s output lies placid and arresting before usWhat is the quality of this work which makes it at once eluding and enduringI think it is starkunsentimental preoccupation with beautyMrAldington is in love with beauty Not to quote Leigh Hunt in the little present making stylewith baskets of new fruit and pots of rosesbut with consuming passion There is nothing pretty about this poetry it is not prettinessbut beautythat the poet is afterThis naked beauty MrAldington found in the GreeksOne feels that his youth was passed in a kind of painful homesicknessthe nostralgia of a beauty which he could not then see about himGreek poetry and Italian landscape gave him easeandsolaced and floweringhis first work was under their influence I do not know which of MrAldington s poems first saw the light of day in Poetryand I have not the volumes here to refer toBut the first collection of his poems in Des Imagistes shows this preoccupation with Greek themesAll of the poems are Greek in feelingmany of them have Greek titles and are perfectly Greek in contentTake this onefor instance Bromios The withered bonds are brokenwaxed reeds and the double pipe about mehot wind swirls the red pine trunks Iothe fauns and the satyrstouch of their shagged curled fur blunt horns They have wine in heavy craters black and redto splash on her white body IoShe shrinks from the cold showerAfraidafraidLet the Maenads break through the myrtles And the boughs of the rohododaphnaiLet them tear the quick deersfleshAhthe cruelexquisite fingers The Little Review IoI have brought you the brown clustersThe ivy boughs and pine conesYour breasts are cold sea ripplesBut they smell of the warm grassesThrow wide the chiton and the peplumMaidens of the DewBeautiful are your bodiesO MaenadsBeautiful the sudden foldsThe vanishing curves of the white linen About youIo Hear the rich laughter of the forestThe cymbalsThe trampling of the panisks and the centaursThe objectors say that that is merely a copyIt lays itself open to that criticismcertainlybut how exquisite a copyAnd how difficult to make such a copy Try it and see MrAldington is a master of suggestionHis descriptions are never overloadedand yet there is the pictureIn the next stanza to the lastnotice the blowingrippling linen over the white bodies of the young girlsA little of this goes a long wayyou sayYesI think that is truebut MrAldington has other strings to playHe has ironya not too common trait in modern poetryI know few things more beautifuland more ironical than this Lesbia Use no more speech nowLet the silence spread gold hair above us Fold on delicate foldYou had the ivory of my life to carveUse no more speechAnd Picus of Mirandola is deadAnd all the gods they dreamed and fabled ofHermesand Thothand Christare rotten nowRotten and dankAnd through it all I see your pale Greek face Tenderness makes me as eager as a little child To love youYou morsel left half cold on Caesar s plateThat last line is a triumph of the disagreeableMrAldington s beauty does not cloy he knows how to spice it In the Via Sestina O daughter of Isisstandest beside the wet highway this decayed Romemanifest harlotand slim art thou a marble phallusface is the face of IsisAs she is carven in basaltmy heart stops with awe the presence of the gods There beside thee on the stall of images the head of Osiris lordEven in this first collection we see that the Greek awakening was a real awakeningand that once taught to seethe poet can go on seeingThe charge of copying is unfairThere is nocopyingin thisAu Vieux Jardin I have sat here happy in the gardens Watching the still pool and the reedsAnd the dark clouds Which the wind of the upper airTore like the green leafy boughsOf the divers hued trees of late summer But though I greatly delight In these and the water lilies That which sets me nighest to weepingIs the rose and white colour of the smooth flag stones And the pale yellow grasses Among them I think that is one of the best poems which MrAldington has done The rose and white colour of the smooth flag stonesalmost sets me weeping tooso desolate are theywith the yellow grasses growing up between themI suppose the thing which is so satisfying in MrAldington s work is the intense feeling which underlies the astringent utteranceWith all his sternuncompromising techniquefor MrAldington is a remarkable techniciangoes a passionate violence of feelingThe Imagists are constantly accused of being inhumanmere intellectualsHow strange it is that the feeling which merely turns white and makes no movement should go unperceivedwhile hysterical screams and lamentationsover in a momentpass for the outpourings of true passion What we have outgrown on the stage still holds in poetryit seemsFeeling there surely is in Childhoodprinted in Some Imagist PoetsYetsomehowthe poem is not as good as it ought to beI suspect that MrAldington has not yet quite mastered the technique of the long poemFeeling is thereand we get the dullness of the little town perfectlyand the stalesalt smell of the harbourand there are excellent descriptions the public parkand the wonderful box in the attic but the poem as a whole does notget over Necessarily more discursive than the shorter poemsit has not enough command of the dramatic to succeedHaving taught himself for years to say things in the fewest possible wordsthe length of this poem has weakened the poet s methodHe must study the requirements of the longer poem a little more before he will be quite at home in itSuch as it isChildhood is interesting as showing the broadening of its author s mind and interestsHe no longer sees with the eyes of other centuries he sees things about himand as they areHere is a perfectly modern picture Round Pond Water ruffled and speckled by galloping windWhich puffs and spurts it into tiny pashing breakersDashed with lemon yellow afternoon sunlight The shining of the sun upon the waterIs like a scattering of gold crocus petalsIn a long wavering irregular flight The water is cold to the eyeAs the wind to the cheek In the budding chestnutsWhose sticky buds glimmer and are half burst open The starlings make their clitter clatter And the blackbirds in the grass Are getting as fat as the pigeons Too hoothis is brave Even the cold wind is seeking a new mistressHow very well he has given the glinting of the sunlight And thatToohoothis is braveis delightfully joyous and adolescentOf all the poems which MrAldington has writtenThe Poplar is certainly the most generally likedAnd I am not prepared to say that the public is not rightPerhaps it really is the bestI don t knowI am very fond of itPoplar Why do you always stand there shivering the white stream and the roadpeople pass through the dust bicyclesin cartsin motor carswagoners go by

PortlandOregonnewspaper had smugly remarkededitoriallythat Portland was far ahead of many other cities in its treatment of Emma Goldman in that it ignored her altogetherpandemonium broke looseWithin a few daysthat paper and all the others in town gave Miss Goldman such front page notices and such flaring headlines that the war in Europe seemed quite an insignificant thing compared to the peril which seemed to be threatening theRose Cityon account of her presence in our midstThe apparent reason for this agitation was that one littleold woman by the name of MrsJosephine Johnson had heard through a friendwhose name she refused to divulgeeven when so ordered by the courtthat on the evening of the lecture on Friedrich Nietzsche somebody had distributed a pamphlet on birth controlThe real reason for the arrest was that the police wished to break up the meetingThey had previously sent Miss Goldman a notice that she could not speak any more in Portland on any subject whateverThis order could never have been carried out as we have free speech in Portlandso they used another methodMiss Goldman and DrReitman were arrested on the evening of August 6 just after the meeting beganand at 103 0 at night all bail except cash was refusedwhich is contrary to all idea of justiceBut for the efforts of MrCESWoodwho has always been a staunch friend of all freethinkersMiss Goldman would have been thrown into jail in a city where she has been allowed to lecture every year for nearly twenty years and where her friends have come to look forward to her annual visits as we do to all the other good things that come to uslike the spring and the rain and the sunshinefor of just such healing and life giving qualities are her inspirational messagesThere were two trialsThe first was the usual sort and really is of small interestAt this trial held in the Municipal courtMiss Goldman and DrReitman were found guilty of distributing obscene literature and fined10 0 eachAs a matter of factMiss Goldman knew nothing about the distribution of the leafletbut she certainly would have approved of it if she hadThis sentence of the lower court was promptly appealedand in the second trialwhich took place in Dept5 of the Circuit court under Judge William NGatensthe case was dismissed for lack of evidenceWhen we remember that one of our bravest rebelsMargaret Sangerwill soon have to face a trial on a similar charge we can only hopevainly The Little Review and wildly perhapsthat she will be fortunate enough to have a presiding judge as fair minded as Judge GatensSome of his remarks were so refreshingcoming as they did in such fine defiance of the usual attitude of those on the bench towards those who are accusedthat they are worthy of quotingDuring the trial Judge Gatens saidThe Court says the defendants are not here chargedas has been stated by the councilwith creating anarchistic tendenciesor with being anarchists they are here to be charged for the offense set forth in the information and for no other offense Every personwhen charged with a crimeshould have the right to know the nature of the crime with which he is chargedmeet the witnesses face to faceand be tried without prejudicenot to be tried on the ground that you don t like this person or that person because they have some view different from yours Now it seems to me that the trouble with our people today is that there is too much pruderyIgnorance and prudery are the millstones about the neck of progressEveryone knows thatWe are all shocked by many things publicly stated that we know privately ourselvesbut we haven t got the nerve to get up and admit itand when some person brings our attention to something we already knowwe feign modesty and we feel that the public has been outraged and decency has been shocked when as a matter of fact we know all these things ourselves I am a member of the Oregon Hygiene SocietyWe get out literature and place it in the toilets all over the statetelling people how to guard against the evils of veneral diseases and so forthWe do that for the uplift of humanityto protect society from all those thingsand the public does not seem to be very much shocked about itThe Little Review Poetry Versus ImagismHUNTLY CARTER I entirely disagree with MrCarter s point of view as much of it as I can fathomBut I hope his article will provoke discussion that will lead to clearer understanding of the Imagist s art in a country where even poets are blind to itMrCarter states his position briefly as follows The Imagists claim that the subjects with which they deal find a completer and more adequate poetical expression in the Imagist form than in any otherGranting that this is sothe question still remains whether this form is essential to poetry or whether it tends to exclude poetrySo one has to consider what poetry really is and what it impliesMy article is designed for this purpose How horribleto treat miracles like thisThe Editoryears ago I went to the Falkland Islands to sheep farm for a bare subsistenceand while living on a lonely station twenty miles from everywhereso to speaktending my flockwhat time the half breeds came and helped themselves to my humble belongingsI experienced a new emotionPerhaps it would be more correct to say I became aware of the nature of an old emotionI felt the currents of transcendent energy which I felt in my childhoodBut I now felt them more frequentlyand I saw that I was elevated by them beyond the normal course of every day lifeAt such moments I forgot the sheepthe pastures and the marauding half breedsI even forgot the strong colour and form of natureI saw something ridding me of solid things and leaving nothing but a fluid universeI saw distinct forms melting to formative motionsI had been caught in the midst of an intense current a transforming current of livingnessMoreoverI was free to the currentwith the result that I became a part of itself fluidunresistinglyand was actuated accordinglyFor the time beingI moved as the fluid element most moved meLater reflection showed me that I was moved by some ineffable thing which I believe to be poetryIt may be that the soul is made of poetryand after the human soul has freed itself from the fetters of materialism it becomes re converted to poetry that isa part of its own flow or motionI do not think materialists will understand thisBut it will be clear to the spiritual mindedI am sure that the hypothesisthat poetry is simply soul stuffis a verifiable oneI am convinced that in my Falkland Island dayswhenever I was raised by intensity out of my material self at a higher level than actualitywhenever such intensity annihiliated time and spaceobliterated that personality which I call Huntly Carterlifted me to the infinite and eternal and left me dumbI was experiencing poetryI know that the hypothesis involves two assumptionsFirstthat poetry cannot be writtenIt can only be expressed in motion or actionAnd it can only be expressed by the person who receives it direct from its source or fountHence a significant poet is not one who writes versebut one who lives poetryis poetryThe second assumption is that every human being who possesses the smallest soul vibration possesses a poetry senseand isin facta potential poetGiven absolute freedomhetoowould become poetrysuch is the power of conversion residing in the element waiting to operate upon himWhich is not absurd when we come to think of itI find I am not alone in the attempt to rescue poetry from the lumberheap of verbalism and verbaliststo say nothing of verbiageand to restore it to the infiniteI remember reading in an early number of the London Poetry Review that life has a rhythmic origin and poetry resides first of all in the rhythms of motion and soundOf coursesoundis redundantseeing that sound is the result of motionI read further that poetry ultimately finds its way into language as the vocal expression of the fundamental motion or rhythmCould anything be clearerWe feel the motion or rhythm and act itAnd we attempt to express it in words in the last resortPerhapssome day nearer the milleniumit will be discovered that languageverbal of courseis the last resort of the poetically destituteThe gist of what I read was this Firstpoetry is the transmutation of some natural elementmotionsound or what notinto simple emotionmotion passing into e motion Then as the generic emotions pass beyond the senses they are handled by the intellectOne knows what the intellect doesBeing peculiarly constituted to submit everything to scrutiny and analysisit seizes upon the vague and indefinable characters of the human feelings and attempts the impossible task of analyzing their composition and stating their quantity and quality with precision Note what great emphasis the Imagists place upon the value of precision In other wordsthe intellect sets to work to regulate poetry by form and law Againnote how the Imagists emphasize the importance of form and law I suppose only the poet who proceeds upon instinct and despises methodical verse makingrecognizes the stupidity of trying to express poetry in terms of intellectual states of mindTo himthe vision of poetry in terms of cerebralism can only have one effectnamelyto kill poetryAfter reading this explanation of poetryI felt I ought to credit the writer with a desire to exalt poetry to the InfiniteFirsthoweverit was necessary to determine what he meant by the process oftransmutation If he meant the activity of thethingwhich I call poetryand not thethingitselfif he was thinking of the change effected in the poet s soul after it has received the rhythmic element which effects the change then poetry to him was clearly the operation and not the operating agentFurtherthere was the individualizing meaning to be consideredLet us assume that the poet s soul receives rhythms or vibrations from the Infinitewhich it instantly converts into its ownJust as a magnetic needle receives its own currents and points arightWhere is one to look for poetryIs it the vibrations themselvesor is it the act of conversionI sought the answer in the writer s own words thatpoetry resides first of all in the rhythms or motion and I concluded that he was not making a precise use of the wordtransmutation So I was able to relate his explanation of poetry to one I had published somewhere in The New FreewomanThis was my explanationThere is a creative force underlying all phenomenaAt an early period of the world s history when self ownership was real not a dream man was provoked by this force into poetic actionThe force operated by dissolving man into its own and thereby exalting him mysticallyBut as man became more and more intellectualso gradually he lost the power of being dissolvedand provoked into mystical actionWith the result that he invented words to take the place of actionAnd as this process of degeneration continuedso he evolved substitutes paid actorspoetspainters to do for him what he had lost the power to do for himselfThus the verbal poet is simply a projection of man s lost capacity to poetize himself and for himselfThat isthe power to obliterate himself physicallyI need not go into this point furtherIf necessaryI could show that many human activities and most human institutions are symptomatic of the long drawn out diseases of self suppression and self annihilationMindI speak of the spiritual self and not that usually confused with a corporeal natureThis rather long but necessary preface brings me to another and more recent attempt to recover the old emotionI refer to my recent experience with The Egoist and the subject of Imagism in its relation to poetryI suppose most intelligent persons are inquiring what Imagism and The Egoist have to do with each otherThe Egoist is obviouslyas its name impliesa journal devoted to egoismAnd its sub title informs us that it is an individualistic reviewOf courseegoism is an entirely individualistic affairIt consists in putting on the armour of self assertion and defending the special faith and interests of one s ownThe power that one seeks to win is that of subjecting material conditions and exacting the utmost spiritual toll from everythingOne pays no regard to the opinion of othersand refuses to play the part of a cypherand at the same time refuses to play any part with othersTo stand aloneand with a light heart to do the necessary bargaining with external influences for the possession of one s own soul thisit seems to meis the true ground of egoismOpposed to this is the process of self suppressionthe process of making bundles of cyphersWhen men obliterate not their corporeal natures but the spiritual part of themselvesby coming together and acting togetherand so juggle the play tricks in order that they may gain the applause and reward of their fellowsthey are cyphersnot egoistsand deserve to be treated as cyphersPersons who take this view of egoism have naturally been watching for the appearance in the pages of The Egoist of numerous writers with aspirations beyond the group The Little Review or societal level and not seeing them appear have begun to ask what The Egoiststands for I believe this question ofstanding foris one which is hurled at every new and significant journalOne knows that it has been flung at THE LITTLE Review There are two ways of answering itA journal may show that it doesstand forsomethingor it may confound its critics by claiming the high distinction of notstanding foranythingSimply it does not exist in time and spaceIt exists by the grace of Godso to speakAs to what The Egoiststands for it is not my concernThe thing for me to note is that for some issues it has been affected by a very strong habit of ImagismNow Imagism is not egoismI do not think the Imagists themselves are egoistsTo me they appear to be socialists by instinct and individualists by professionjust as MrBernard Shaw is an individualist by instinct and a socialist by professionHe is an autocrat with a democratic lampblack rubbed over his face to commercialize his appearanceThe Imagists are the reverse with the added difference that they use the polish to beautify rather than commercialize their appearanceIn saying this I do not wish to appear to be attacking the ImagistsOn the contraryI am anxious to pay them every possible complimentThe fact that they are sinning against themselves must be its own punishmentThe tendency of The Egoist towards Imagism flowered in the May issueThis issue was in factorganized if I may use a trade termfrom cover to cover to provide an honest and profitable discussion of the so callednewthing in poetryAs if poetry can be newI had an idea that God made poetry when the world was very young indeedWellI turned to the May Egoist in order to rediscover my emotionI found the journal comprised an admirable treatise on the theory and practice of Imagism with some uncritical praise and a strong note of criticism thrown inI read the prose with a good deal of interestparticularly MrHarold Munro s historyorigin and criticism of ImagismIt seems MrMunro objects to Imagism on the general ground that it is not inspired by the High MusesIt is rather the work of poets on the way to Parnassus who have stopped half way to chase haresThe fact of the matter is that if an Imagist has a passionate instantaneous impression to start with he does not end with itHe simply destroys it before he has got very far with intellectual or technical theoriesIn MrMunro s very words poets of the Imagist and other kindred modern schools are no longer visited by the Muses they are not at home to them How far this is true one may learn from the Imagists themselvesHere are some extracts from their contributions to the saidSpecial Imagist Number Somewhere in the gleam of the year 1908MrTEHulmeexcited by the propinquityat a half a crown dance of the other sex proposed to a companion that they should found a PoetsClubThe thing was donethere and thenThe Club began to dine In November of the same yearEdward Storerpublished the first book ofImagist poems This statement that the Imagist movement was started by Edward Storer and TEHulmewas subsequently refuted by MrAllen Upward who it seems received the Imagist message in 1900 froma poet named Cranmer Byng who had received it from Professor Gileswho had brought a tablet of China from the East with all sorts of wonderful little poems painted thereonLaterMrEzra Pound made for MrAllen Upward the Imagist garland to deck his forehead in the Court of EternityTo continue the extracts MrStorer was in favor then of a poetry describedas a form of expressionlike the Japanesein which an image is the resonant heart of an exquisite momentIthe writerhad been advoatinga poetry in vers libreakin in spirit to the JapaneseA dissatisfaction with English poetry as it was then being writtenled to a desireto replace it by the Japanese tanka and haikaHeHulmeinsisted on absolutely accurate presentation and no verbiage used to spend hours each day in the search for the right phraseWethe Imagist groupwere very much influenced by modern French symbolist poetryThe group died a lingering death at the end of its second winterHePoundhad made Imagism to mean pictures as Wyndham Lewis understands them writing later for TPs Weekly he made it pictures as William Morris understood them So much for the history of Imagism and the expansion of MrEzra Pound according to MrFSFlintOne next learns with regard to MrPound thathe will sincerely work over a few lines of vers libre Hetried to cultivate a sense of stylea feeling for words he began to try to make poetry out of the realities of existencehe is abookishpoetIt is inevitable that theimprovedand selected world which the Romantic poet creates should be composedat least in partof ideasof declarationof emotions derived from extensive reading If the prizes of this world were given to merit that poem deserves the prize usually reserved for some not too revolutionaryhonest craftsman Thus MrRichard Aldington or MrEzra PoundNext as toHDThe poetry of HDhas been described as a kind ofaccurate mystery it has the precision of Goldsmith s workThe things sheHD has seen and the emotions she has felt have been transmuted in her mind into an unreality that reveals itself in images of an unsuspected virtue and in phrases that seem to owe nothing to common speechA poet who will accept nothing that has not come to her directHer ceaseless scrutiny of the word and phraseA tendency to pare and cut too far It is MrFSFlint who writesFrom the next article one gathers thatevery poet must seek anew for himselfout of the language medium at his disposalrhythms which are adequate and forms which are expressive of his own unique personality And again what will teach us most is our language and lifeHeMrFletcheris seen at his best where fancyimaginationmusical ingenuityverbal magicand a curious feeling for the landscape of Chinese painting are fused in an intriguing and quite beautiful lyric sequence MrFerris Greenslet is writing on the poetry of John Gould FletcherI have quoted sufficient to indicate the historyaimscope and methods of Imagism as set forth by the ImagistsPerhaps I should add an extract or twoalso in inverted commasfrom MrHarold Munro s contribution Theirthe Imagists insistence on the necessity of an absolutely fresh start in poetry They claim to have discoveredpoetry as an Art They devoted their energies solely to the cultivation of new form and the adoption of a renovated language oblivious of the fact that Idea must primarily dictate bothThe forms they still felt they might usethe vocabulary that remained at their disposalwere extremely limited They had thrown so much good material awaythat they remained now almost unprovided with a language or a style It looks as though they threw away the baby with the bath waterSo they divided Some decided to tolerate the old subjectsbut to discover a new manner of presenting or representingthem othersnot so satisfiedprobed nervously the psychological recesses of the New World and dragged out all the strangest rags of fancy they could findexhibiting them solely on account of their whimsical colour and shapesFurther they do not profess to singNeither does modern commerce They swear bythe best of intellectTheir minds are obsessed by the Town They acclaim thepassing event They suspect thebeauties of poetryThe method of the Imagists is to model little detached patterns of words One of their principles seems to suggestthat if one first design a poemthen the idea will be present by reason of the design This recalls the principle of certain theatre reformers that if one builds a new theatre a new form of drama will enter crowned with daisiesIt is equal to saying that given a donkey s tail the donkey will be present because of the tailAfter reading the Imagiststheories I read their verseWithouthoweverrecovering my emotionIt left me coldI asked myself if poetry had ceased to run through meWas I no longer its agentHad intellect interposed to censor it with formIn other wordswas my conception of poetry wrongWas the Imagistsconception wrongThen I remembered that when I first experienced poetry and became aware of what I experiencedand when I began to express what I experiencedI proceeded on the principle of not mixing with my expressed experience any intellectual elements of thoughtideareason or what notI simply allowed some element to flow through meand myself to be actuated by the flowTo me poetical expression was really an abstraction of the individualizing features of a spiritual experience received and transmitted in an instant of timeIt expressed a creative movement abstracted from a creative movementjust as a subconscious drawing externalizes certain vibrations received through a magnetic mediumThis creative movement appointed me its receiver that I might impart a momentary outwardness and sensational reality to its external contentActually I was saturated with this precious element as a sponge can be saturated with rich perfumeand like the sponge was prepared to saturate in turnIn my beliefpoetry is this spiritually saturating elementI would say it is a unifying elementbringing a like element in each of us into a unity of Soul or Spirit consciousnessThat isthe consciousness of Soul states which transcend this sordid material life in which we are so deeply immersedI can imagine a true poet saturated by this element having glimpses of a supreme and superb Beingand thus entering consciously into that state of BeingBut I cannot possibly imagine such a poet finding poetic expression in pots and pans and tup ny tubesand the confused and meaningless odds and ends of material lifeI know there are certain poets who claim they have poetry in themand because of thisthey The Little Review can poetize any objectJustas I supposethe bee can pour forth honey on any objector wine can be used to adulterate waterButof coursethe honey does not change the object into honeynor the wine turn the water into wineany more than the poetry element poured forth lavishly can transmute a motor car or any dead thing into living poetryIndeedall that poetsobsessed by the theory of poetizing town and kitchen stuffreally dois to waste their precious possessionActually they precipitate their sweet scent on a concrete floorIf such poets ever hope to take the Golden Road they must leave shrieking machinery alone and cease pouring the perfumes of Araby over cancrous civilizationThey must leave perishable things to perishable minds and fit out an expedition to the Inner SelfThereby they may hope to return wet with the poetic spiritIn other wordsthey will return with rich experiences lit by the flame of poetryIt seems then that the reason I could not feel the Imagist verse was because I was trying it by a law or principle which told me that poetry makes itself felt through the sensesnot through the intellectFurthermoreit makes itself felt not only by passionately initiating us into some mystery or other of realitybut by making us an active part of that mysteryThe poet is a signature of poetic realityI do not say this is the ultimate test of poetryIt may be that poetry is so indefinable as to elude all testsAgain it may be that this very indefinableness is the test of poetryThe secret in its motion cannot be analyzedOne cannot explain it any more than one can explain the odor of a flowerOne is aware of it that is allYetI may askhow does the Imagist poetry stand my testThe first thing one notices in the poetry is its air of cerebrality verging on cerebralitisAccordingly one discovers an inordinate love of the intellectual qualities of styleand consequentlya feverish quest for figuresSo there are figures of every kindCondensing and visualizing figuresfigures of similaritycontiguity and contrastfigures describing and analyzing perishable thingsThere is in fact a profusion of figures having one characteristic in commonnamelya straining after noveltyoriginality and freshnessIf for the sake of argument one admits that poetry can be expressed in wordsof course one admits that poetry can be expressed in images or figures of speechBut this is not to say that figures of speech are consequently poetryOtherwise every bit of foolish verse that has ever been written could lay claim to the imperishable GarlandEvery tup ny box would be entitled to arrest each

would refuse to accept them as poetrybut on a different groundNo doubt they would say that many of these figures have been manufactured in the wrong placeThey have been made in the cerebrum instead of in the Imagist quarterthe cerebellumThey are in fact suffering from cerebritis whereas nowadays the proper complaint is cerebralitisSo the Imagists would complain that such figures do not conform to

this is very prettyBut when all is said I do not see why some of the figures may not pass the test as they standWhen MrHulme wants to describe a nature experience he does it in this lengthy fashion A touch of cold in the autumn night I walked abroadAnd saw the ruddy moon lean over a hedgeLike a red faced farmerI did not stop to talkbut nodded And round about were the wistful stars With white faces like town childrenThe similitude of ared faced farmerdoes not raise the subject to heightsIt is entirely lacking in dignityis commonplaceand suggests ludicrous associationsFor instancemuch beer and a hot game of skittlesWhen Browning does it he gets to work in a businesslike mannerThe sun looked over the water s brim And straight there was a path of gold for him And a world of souls for meI quote from memorybut I believe I quote correctlyThe image is expressed with brevityclearnessand dignityKeats s way of expressing the experience is I who still saw the universal sun Heave his broad shouder o er the edge of the world The similitude ofheaving the shoulderis open to the same objection as that of ared faced farmer It is undignifiedIt calls up a vision of the sun shooting coals down the front cellarAgainwhen the John Gould Fletcher wants to describe umbrellas in a new way he refers to them as Bendingrecurved blossoms of the stormAnd a special movement of rain is exactly described as Uneven tinklingthe lazy rain Dripping from the eavesThe ingenuity of these comparisons takes away Miss Amy Lowell s breathWriting in The New Republic she uses the termabsolutely original And she tells us how well the first figuresmakes us see those roundshining umbrella tops while the second isa marvel of exact description I dare say Miss Lowell is rightAnd yet the description The news was The Little Review a dagger to his heart was just as original when it was written longlong agoand is certainly as vivid and intense in its way as anything by MrFletcher praised by Miss Amy LowellComparing the new with the old in this wayone may well inquire whether the new fashioned Imagists differ so very much from the old fashioned ones whom they seek to destroyFor my partI have no hesitation in asserting that the subject of the old order of verse does not differ from that of the new orderIf present day Imagists are bringing a number of contemporary facts and incidents into figurative employment if they cut their particular capers In a Tubeor in My Backgardenor in a Bathor at The Breakfast Tableor amid Slapsor in Chicagoor in the Pine TreesTopsor After the Retreatthey are doing precisely what the everyday Imagist has done with contemporary facts ever since the world beganSo the truth is that subject for subject they are no nearer the Parnassian height than the mereset babbler of driveling verseAnd if they are really mounting the peaksif as they claim they are making an absolutely fresh start at poetrythey are being pushed there by expression or techniquenot poetryIn their view the mere curling and combing of words is sufficient to elevate them above such common poets as Shakespeare and the restand to entitle them to a seal among the really elect in the poetry businessButof coursethe bare fact that the Imagists are out for a revolution in form does not prove that they are out to give us a taste of real poetryIt only proves they are out for a revolution in formAnd if one examines their form carefullyI believe it will be found to prove that there are poets among us suffering rather severely from the modern cant disease of cultureTheyknowso much rather than feel anythingand because they know so much one meets them in every nook and cornertalking incessantly about the necessity of other poets knowing what they knowand doing as they doIndeed they regard the production and advertisement of their particular kind of goodswhich have become a sort of cult among a large number of persons who believe in hard study and disciplinerather than in spontaneity and livingnessas the beginning and end of earthly existenceBut if one come to the bottom of the whole business it really amounts to no more than thisTennyson and Kipling turned their attention to verse makingThey did not write poetryThey wrote doggerelbecause what they wrote was in doggerel formThe Imagists have turned their attention to verse makingPerhaps it should be versicle makingThey do write poetryThey write poetry because what they write has a poetry formIn shortthe difference between TennysonKipling and the Imagists is one of formIf the former had used present day Imagist form they would be supreme poetsThere is nothing to prove that Tennyson and Kipling could not have cultivated Imagist formTherefore Tennyson and Kipling could have written Imagist verseThey were potentially supreme poetsHow anyone can reasonably pretend that mere form transforms a subject into poetry passes my understandingHow anyonemoreovercan suggest in cold print that such form is helping to make an absolutely new start in poetry is a point best left to the decision of mental expertsStillon reflectionone finds it is all part of the moderngameof confusing content with formOne must be grateful to the Imagists for one thingFor some time there has been a movement among poets of a certain school to shift the interest from poetry to themselves considered as deputiesThe errors of the Imagistswhoapparentlyare mistaken in their conception of poetry and the business of poetryenables one to shift the interest from these poets to poetry itselfOne can say to them We are not interested in youbut in poetryTo tell us that you are deputy receivers and recorders to describe your aims and methodsto take us to museums and to invite us to study the fossilized remains of ancient literaturesis not to help us to enjoy your verse Poets do not get any nearer to poetry by setting up new rulers and standardsPoetry does not take us farther afield into speculating on form and techniquebut farther from themPoetry tends to shift the interest from the poet to itselffrom the solid instrument of transmission to the world in solutionIndeed it tends to obliterate the poet in the physical senseAs I said it converts him into poetryNow the reason why Imagism fails as poetry is precisely because it shifts the interest from the world in solution to a group of tootoo solid poetsM y conclusion is obviousBefore the Imagists can claim that they are making an absolutely new start in poetrythey must learn to obliterate their corporeal naturesThe moment they do so obliterate themselvesthat moment one can safely sayNow we are coming to poetry I intended to show that one cannot write free verse unless one is a free poetI must return to the subjectThe New Idol GEORGE BURMAN FOSTER AN OL D philosopher Aristotleof course called man a political beingBy this he meant that man was naturally endowed for societyandfurtherthat society could find its full fruition only in the stateTo the old Greekthis political vocation of man seemed great and sublimeOnly one will ruled in the stateThis one will synthesized all the individual willsno matter how powerful and diverse they wereAnd this one will made all the distributive wills strongand demonstrated its superiority to the totality of all such willsThe one will wills more than it can doon that account becomes a statesmanthat iswidens out his will to a state willThusthe one will wins a new and wider sphere for its abilities and activitiesBut it was the modern post mediaeval state which was the first to set the thought of that impersonalunemotional philosopher in its true lightThe modern state has brought to consciousness the whole gigantic weight of the world s political unfolding of forceThe modern state is related to what the ancient Greeks called statethe Hellenic city communitymuch as one of our mighty industrial machines is related to the primitive tool of a day laboreror a modern machine gun to the sling and bow of an ancient warriorOur states are indeed machinesAll their parts fit into each other with the utmost precisionand work with astonishing accuracyOur states are also huge weapons with numberless barrelsbut employed by a single willunloaded at the word of a single CommanderIt was the first chancellor of the German Empire who once asserted at a meeting of the Reichstag that politics ruined characterThis of course put a damper on all the ardor that lauded to the skies the greatest invention of modern timesthe new miracle of the stateThis assertion clangs like a first elegiac note like the intimation of an interior fatalitydeep seated already in the organism of the modern political and cultural lifeThis word utters no sentimental fanaticism whichwith all sorts of romantic scruples and moral standardsobserves the course of the immense evolution of folk lifeThis brave word comes from a man whom the whole world of his day celebrated as the foremost master of the art of politicsIn his handsthe political machine underwent an unheard of development of powerAnd what this statesman expressed only provisionally perhaps in an ill humoredunguarded moment has been meanwhile developed by earnest men to a consciousserious concern for men of a new and growing cultureThese men have preached that men should turn aside from political lifethey have seen in spirit a coming day in which state lessunpolitical man shall have reached a purer higher stage of life than was at all possible under the banner of a political cultureAnarchists we today call these warriors against the stateWhat they fightthese warriorsis not this or that particular form of statenot this or that particular institutionbut the state in every formstate in generalBut because the word anarchism is ambiguousbecause it is not simply an ancient theorybut occasionally signifies a quite tangible praxiswe must distinguish between the idealthe spiritual champions of anarchismand the preachers of a propaganda of bloody deedWhileat bestthe latter would only drive out the devil by Beelzebubthe former would have a noble faith in the victorious power of the ideaTheirs is the high faith that the might of ideals is mightier than the might of forceThey trust that humanity will overcome the political malady through spiritual development and inner strengthand will mature in the direction of an anarchistic cultureAnd in the rank of these idealistic anarchistswho contemplate the state as the most grievous hindrance to a noble and pure humanity a Prince Kropotkina Count Tolstoia former German army officer von Egidy Friedrich Nietzsche also belongsayehe leads the van of all the poets and thinkers who espy the future task of humanity in the negationthe overcomingof the stateAnarchismeven in its most ideal formseems dismal enough to most menYet it is understandable even a natural necessity in the evolution of modern lifeIt is with the spiritual currents of life as it is with the vibrations of the pendulumThe stronger the movement toward the one sidethe further the rebound toward the otherAs a matter of factthe political pendulum has been far removed from the line of equilibriumThe cultured peoples of Europe and it was thesenot the American peoplewhich Nietzsche had in mindhad worked themselves into a political debauch in which there scarcely seemed to be any other interest than that of politicsWhat the Church was to the mediaeval man the state became to the modern man God manifest on earth Men believed in this state as their ChristAll power in heaven and on earth seemed to be given to ittooWhat was preached in the name of the state was a gospel to its believersT o these believers it even seemed a sin to doubt the wisdom of the state at allIt was blasphemy to contest the state s claim to omnipotenceOnce when it was said Rome has spoken all the rest of the world grew dumb in deferential silenceLater it was said ParisPetersburgBerlinhas spoken and a voice from heaven could not have been hearkened to more sacredly than did political souls take heed to such state edictsGoodWhat is good if not that which benefits the stateTruthBut where is there truth apart from the word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the stateThe political end sanctifies any means makes anything good over which men would be otherwise enragedstamps anything as true which would be otherwise branded a lie in the worldNietzsche hit the nail on the head when he stigmatized the statein the sense of his timeas the new idoland made it say in a Zarathustra discourseOn earth there is nothinggreater than I it is I who am the regulative finger of God everything will it give youif ye worship itthe new idol And this culture of the state was brought into a system by the philosopherit was preached in the

his own conscienceHe is all the more serviceable a scribethe more smoothly he can adapt his well oiled theology to reasons of stateTrulythey were not the worst spirits who rebelled against such idolatryThey were prophets of a new culture who took martyrdom upon themselvesand no small martyrdom at thatto unhorse a belief in the omnipotence and omniscience of the stateFor this belief oppressed

does not think like an animal in a herdis troublesomeThereforeit passes as supreme wisdom of the state to uniformize all mento discipline and drill men to whom the sight of a uniformized mass arouses the feeling of sublime beautyto whom a thousand throated hurrah sounds like the loveliest musicHow much tender feelinghow much inner lifehas been stifled in the day s political alarum who can tellYea says Nietzsche a dying for many hath here been devisedwhich glorifieth itself as life verilya hearty service unto all preachers of deathThe stateI call itwhere all are poison drinkersthe good and the bad the state where all lose themselvesthe good and the bad the statewhere the slow suicide of all is calledlife The sin of the schoolmaster against man as he piles dead history in the image of the ugliest man upon the presentand blocks his future all this has first attained to power and recognition through the political systemand has thereby become a fatalityan extremity of the cultural life of old EuropeSo Nietzsche saw and said as he looked abroad over the lands and peoples of his dayOut of the spiritual formation of the individualthe state made a mechanical drill of the massesOut of the teacher and educator of the peoplethere came to be a master of a schoola slave of a ruleof a methodThe state laid its hand on head and heart then it needed the historian to manipulate and adjust history for political purposesThe state took science into its service and conquered praise from the mouth of the artist himself To seek salvation from political sicknessthis is now the redemptive service of all the men and women to whom man is higher than the stateto whom the ideals of humanity and of personality are alone sacred and supremeThe remedy today is what it once was in old Romesecessionmigration of the spirit to the holy mount of freedomwhere the soul breathes no state airwhere it is not suffocated and oppressed by the iron bars of the stateSecession in art that means unpolitical artan art which knows higher tasks than the glorification of political powerthan the erection of shafts of victorythan promenades of victory Secession in science that means a free university whose teacherssays Nietzschedo not receive their appointments through superannuated militarists and ministers of statea high school of the spiritin which there are no political honors and insigniabut also no state discipline and non age a school where everything is said and taught which an earnest inquiring soul can receive from the world of nature and of man in earnest responses of his spiritSecession in religion that meansfinallya free churchin which faith is not an official dictationbut a firm conviction of the inner mana church where worship is not an inherited rule and custombut the heart s and life s free expression in ways of its ownWho will deny that the best and highest which our day has to show in every sphere of the spirit s lifemust be considered The Little Review everywhere as a work of secessionof rebellion that all this has an anarchistic veinan unpoliticalantipoliticalyesa superpolitical stampOver all finer natures there have come a bitter depression and indignation at all political doing and dickeringthey would rather stay and work at home where no one strives nor criesthan walk the streets so full of the uproar which politicians makeAll soulsturned to withinthe clairvoyants of the spirit and the fine tasters of life agree of course with Nietzschethatwhere the state endsthere man beginsThe state has its pattern and uniform for themany too many for the superfluous who in great choruses bawl of the most superfluous that there is for manGreat souls seek sites for lone ones and twain onesthey seek them beyond the many too manythere they sing the songs of that which is necessary for manthe single and irreplaceable melodythrough which man jubilates along to his higher existenceThe state has killed and crushed the peoplesit has summoned into the world the great lieIthe stateam the people But there is only one redemption and convalescence from the state on the part of the peoplea flightto people who do not understand the state and hate it as an evil eye and sin in custom and law which speaks its own tongue of good and evil and makes its own language of custom and law Thus is secession the emigration from the state into the people the culture of the future is the overcoming of the state through the people To be sureit is with mixed feelings that we penetrate and interpret the preaching of the anarchist NietzscheThe catalogue of sins whichon a deeper observation of lifewe have to charge to state cultus is indeed greatand hence there is an anarchistic side to the heart of the modern manas soon as he thinks of his own rightsas soon as he requires light and air for the free unfolding of his personalityWe know that the state does not possess eternal lifeThe state is only a special form in which human social life can existnot human society itselfThere have not always been statesThey came to be in the long course of the evolution of a people s lifeWhat comes to be must pay its toll to Father TimeThe state will change and pass Hence it is indeed folly and superstitutionit is idolatrywhen we attribute eternal worth to transitory phenomenaand accord them an unconditional dominion over usButfor all thatthere is the state still and although we may not say with Hegelthe special hero of state omnipotencethat all that is real is rationalyet never is anything that really isentirely irrationalThe state is still the soil on which we stand and which we tillthat it may be able to receive the seed of the spirit the state is an evolutionary stage of human cultureIt is a vessel for the reception of the life of the human spiritIt is one of the conditions of life through which present man must make his way of necessityif he is to fulfil his highest destinyTherefore it is also folly and superstitionan idolatry of one s own egoand of one s own personalityif a man thinks he can unfold the wealth of the human by turning aside from the stateWhere the life interests of man solidify to political tendenciesthere remains something for the solitary man to see and to learnto do and to achieveand it is a subtle and dangerous temptation when a man in his solitude proposes to find his satisfaction in the enjoyment of his books and in the world of his own thoughts and feelings without concern for the weal or woe of the political body of which he is a memberPolitics is raw to refined naturesBut so is all the material with which man laborsand out of which he fashions what is fineLet creative spirits make out of the state a human society in which all human greatness can growThe idolatry of the state islike any idolatrya poison in popular lifeBut the antidote which anarchism administers to the present generationsick of the statenamelydominion on the part of the egothe cultus of the Ichmenschdoes not make the matter betterbut perhaps only worseThe personality of man is inded his summum bonumhis soul and lifebut only the wholefreefull personalitywhich feels the pulsations of the common life of humanityof the world only the man to whomas old Terence saidnothing human is foreignbecause he is in a position to read in all the human the language and revelation of the eternalThis man is a political beingbut not a political being aloneHe has his own soul which he affirms against any claim of politics and preserves from injuryHe lives in the statebut also above the stateHe knows well springs of being without which the state would be a desert and dry groundHe is a religious personality who falls down and supplicates no majestybecause he knows God whom alone we

smoking Vesuviusthe respectable Eiffel Towerthe San Marcothe Brandenburg Gatethe Westminster Abbeyand the rest of the hackneyed wondersYet you are nauseatedYour individual has caused the Kodak to

a map is harmlessuntil he gets an inspiration to add something of his ownThe Little Review 43 With what impatience I have awaited Frank Harris s Contemporary PortraitsNot that the name of thepainterappeals to me tremendouslyI am rather uneasy about the cleverists and the renegades who of late have found refuge on the hospitable pages of MrViereck s monthly pamphletBut will you consider extravagant my expectation that any portraitist would reveal exciting things about such unique sitters as WhistlerWildeVerlaineSwinburneMaupassantMaeterlinckRodinFranceor about such remotesemi legendary personages as CarlyleRenanBurtonBrowning The book gave me a slap in the faceThe very first chapter annoyed meI could not make myself believe in the veracity of MrHarris s conversation with Carlylewhich took place some time in 1877 during a strollMrHarris is not a bad fiction writerbut as a hero of his own fiction he appears clumsyThe interview presents a study in black and white the black is the crudenarrowobstinate Scotchmanwhile the white isof coursethe brilliantwittycondescending MrHarrisThis is the leitmotif of the whole bookThePortraitsare used to emphasize and accentuate the superior features of thepainterthesittersare familiarly patted on the shoulderpulled by a string like marionettesand made to talkniceby whim of the ventriloquistDefenceless dummies In one place MrHarris spontaneously exclaims about the only time he gives the impression of spontaneityWhat a pity StPaul did not write aLife of JesusFrank Harris wouldHe would surely not miss the opportunity of capitalizing such acontemporary portrait What a pity MrHarris has not met at a dinner given by Lady and So MrSocratesor MrMosesor MrAdam What a loss of a good sellerAn editor of a brave magazinewhich allows its contributors the free use of the first personal pronounhas rebuked me for my too subjective animosity towards MrHarris s book and for my failure to see its otherbettersideI find my justification in MrHarris s own words I put these portraits forth as works of art In the same measure as the artist is allowedor ratherexpected to present that which seems to him most intrinsic and striking in his subjectso am Ithe appreciatorto have the liberty of criticising in a work of art those features that appear to me most salient and conspicuousAs a matter of fact I enjoyed reading MrHarris s characteristics of the persons he has met he doubtless has an artistic touch in his pen and ink portraitshis criticisms on Mathew ArnoldJohn DavidsonRichard Middletonare interestingBut it is the leitmotif of the book that gives you a general impressionThe impression it made on me I have told in the preceding paragraphsThe pages on WhistlerWildeVerlaineRenanand othersare malodorous the persons whom you admire or love appear blurred and maimedfor in front of them spins the annoying little figure of the portraitistwho preaches good behavior to Oscarwho is charThe Little Review itable

affairyet powerful in its horrorThis pamphlet is nothing but an editorial from an anti German newspaperA test of man s well being and consciousness of power is the extent to which he can acknowledge the terrible and questionable character of thingsand whether he is in any need of a faith at the end NietzscheThe PoetsTranslation Series OBJECT of the editors of this series is to present a number of translations of Greek and Latin poetry and proseespecially of those authors who are less frequently given in EnglishThis literature has too long been the property of pedagoguesphilologists and professorsIts human qualities have been obscured by the wranglings of grammarianswho love it principally because to them it is so safe and so deadBut to many of us it is not deadIt is more alivemore essentialmore human than anything we can find in contemporary English literatureThe publication of such classicsin the way we proposemay help to create a higher standard for poetry than that which prevailsand a higher standard of appreciation of the writers of antiquitywho have suffered too long at the hands of clumsy metristsWe do not deny that there are many good translations in English of classical writers Lang s Homer and TheokritosMackail s Anthology or Aldington s Apuleiusfor instancebut too often such works are lonely and austerely expensiveTHE POET S TRANSLATION SERIES will appear first in The Egoiststarting September 1stand will then be reprinted and issued as small pamphletssimple and inexpensiveso that none will buy except to readThe translations will be done by poets whose interest in their authors will be neither conventional nor frigidThe translators will take no concern with glossesnotesor any of the apparatus with which learning smothers beautyThey will endeavor to give the words of these Greek and Latin authors as simply and as clearly as may beWhere the text is confusedthey will use the most characteristic version where obscurethey will interpretThe first six
