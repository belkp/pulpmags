forgotten truth Or mere companions of my youthAllall aremy thoughts to nightbeing deadwe d have the new friend meet the old we are hurt if either friend seem coldthere is salt to lengthen out the smart the affections of our heartquarrels are blown up upon that headnot a friend that I would bring nightcan set us quarrellingall that come into my mind are deadJohnson comes the first to mindloved

speechWESTERN SCHOOLEdgar Jepson IS uncommonly convenient to know all about a school of poetsespecially when its seat is soChicagothe typical city to be told plainly and firmly that its poets are securelyin their native soilthat their poetry is so much concerned with United States life and soa part of it that it may be said to be becoming nationalthat it is creating a new direction new idiomand is going to be a much more fluid thing than English critics have any idea ofthathasunique features and that unless one realises the newautochthonic note in United Statesto dayin the most distinctive United States poetrythat is one realises nothing of theimpulses and forces that are at work to create a new poetic environment for the comingthat steel railsjournalismmoving picturespopular tales and songslocalworld s fairsclamorous cities will force United States poets from their long eastwardtheir obstinate preoccupation with the arts and literature of feudal EuropeThey will goleaving Europeeven new EuropebehindAnd in that day United States artUnited Stateswill cease to be provincialwill resume the continental habit which began with Waltand Mark TwainAt last they will have to follow the peopleobey the people s need ofis uncommonly convenient also to have the masters of the school stamped authenticby the awardprizes for their poemsby the school itselfto know for certain that MessrsVachel Lindsay Lee Mastersand Robert Frost are the chief representatives of the schoolthat their work isfine flower of its growthYou know where you areThe Little Review the same time it is a trifle worrying to find that the prize poem of the chief master of theis an Ingoldsby legenddoubtless the inspiration was unconscious dealing with the love of alady and brilliant with such jingles asworld was the field of the Chinese man And we were the pride of the sons of HanWe copied deepand we carved in jadeAnd wove white silks in the mulberry shade One might hope that the specifications of patriotism no longer included the DORA to shut our ears and bury our heads in the sand whenever a foreign critic took theto inspect some of ourartorliterature MrJepson s article wasas I understand orderedby a contemporaryand then rejected for its lack of flatteryits lack of kow tow tolocal celebritiesThe aritcle appears at its original length in the English Reviewin soas much of the matter discussed must be only too familiar to the American readerwe havea condensation of treatmentwith however no change of viewand the author has been goodto complyAny one who has heard MrJepson read Homer or discourse on Catullus wouldhis fitness as a judge and as a respecter of poetryThe readers of the Little Reviewlet us hopeless need than any other section of the American public to be told that asort of bad writing is bad writingbut so long as other editorshaving asked forwhen they were ready for nothing but eulogyrefuse to publish the criticismwe mustkeep open houseif only for the national houourand to wear downas much as possible foreign belief in America s mental timidity a barbarous or religious nation will try to suppress the expression of views different fromof its ruling or paying majoritiesThe minimum of possible liberty contracted for in ourof Independence must include a right to hold mental divergences from one sand while such liberty is denied by every religious organizationwe can still point outuselesslythat the Church and State in America have as yet no formal legal connection much religious taboos may have impinged upon special legislationThere is perhaps nolike that of agreat public but one should do one s best to prevent mass tyrannyclutching and penetrating the subjective processes of the individualEP6 Little Review bulk of this master s work however is concerned with United States lifeis genuinely national he is creating the new dictionthe new idiomthe greater fluidity with which the schoolto bless the worldBut for mealasthe bulk of it is just verseand rank badjinglingat thatis in the handlingIt may be that MrLindsay has the true poetic visions of the Fireman sor of General Booth s entering heavenor of Simon Legreehe has failed

dribble these toneless inanities all the world over in every tongueI find the music of these effusions so cheapor so poorand this poor music is common togreat bulk of all the recent United States poetry I have readI sometimes think that thislack of a sense of the beauty of words comes from the manner in which the language of theStates is spoken that monotonous dronegenerally nasalor that monotonous nasal whineIassured that in some parts of the United States you may still hear musical speechbut I cannotthat the speech of any of these three masters is musically modulatedor indeed
