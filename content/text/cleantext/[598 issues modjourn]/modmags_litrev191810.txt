makes your heart beat soNot even your own mother Can know it as I knowWho broke my heart for her When the wild thoughtThat she denies And has forgotSet all her blood astir And glittered in her eyesA Song I thought no more was needed Youth to prolong Than dumb bell and foil To keep the body youngOh who could have foretold That the heart grows oldThough I have many words What woman s satisfiedI am no longer faint Because at her sideOh who could have foretold That the heart grows old2 The Little Review I have not lost desire But the heart that I hadI thoughttwould burn my body Laid on the death bedBut who could have foretold That the heart grows oldSolomon to Sheba Sang Solomon to Sheba And kissed her dusky faceAll day long from midday We have talked in the one placeAll day long from shadowless noon We have gone round and round In the narrow theme of love Like an old horse in a poundTo Solomon sang Sheba Planted on his kneesIf you had broached a matter That might the learned pleaseYou had before the sun had thrown Our shadows on the ground Discovered that my thoughtsnot itAre but a narrow poundSang Solomon to Sheba And Kissed her Arab eyesThere s not a man or woman Born under the skies Dare match in learning with us twoAnd all day long we have found There s not a thing but love can make The world a narrow poundThe Little Review The Living Beauty I ll say and maybe dream I have drawn contentSeeing that time has frozen up the blood The wick of youth being burned andthe oil spentFrom beauty that is cast out of a mould In bronzeor that in dazzling marble appearsAppearsand when we have gone is gone againBeing more indifferent to our solitude Thantwere an apparitionO heart we are oldThe living beauty is for younger men We cannot pay its tribute of wild tearsUnder the Round TowerAlthough I d lie lapped up in linen A deal I d sweat and little earn If I should live as lives the neighboursCried the beggarBilly Bryne Stretch bones till the daylight come On great grandfather s battered tomb Upon a grey old battered tombstone In Glendalough beside the streamWhere the O Bryrnes and Byrnes are buriedHe stretched his bones and fell in a dream Of sun and moon that a good hour Bellowed and pranced in the round towerOf golden king and silver lady Bellowing up and bellowing round Till toes mastered a sweet measure Mouth mastered a sweet soundPrancing round and prancing up Until they pranced upon the top4 The Little Review That golden king and that wild lady Sang till stars began to fade Hands gripped in handstoes close togetherHairs spread on the wind they madeThat lady and that golden king Could like a brace of blackbirds sing It s certain that my luck is brokenThat rambling jailbird Billy said Before nightfall I ll pick a pocket And snug it in a feather bedI cannot find the peace of home On great grandfather s battered tomb March 1918Tom ORoughleyThough logic choppers rule the townAnd every man and maid and boy Has marked a distant object downAn aimless joy is a pure joy Or so did Tom O Roughley say That saw the surges running by And wisdom is a butterfly And not a gloomy bird of prey If little planned is little sinned But little need the grave distressWhat s dying but a second windHow but in zig zag wantoness Could trumpeter Michael be so brave Or something of that sort he said And if my dearest friend were dead I d dance a measure on his grave February 161918The Little Review A Prayer on going into my House God grant a blessing on this tower and cottage And on my heirsif all remain unspoiledNo tableor chair or stool not simple enough For shepherd lads in Galileeand grant That I myself for portions of the year May handle nothing and set eyes on nothing But what the great and passionate have used Throughout so many varying centuries We take it for the normyet should I dream Sinbad the sailor s brought a painted chestOr imagefrom beyond the Loadstone Mountain That dream is a normand should some limb of the devil Destroy the view by cutting down an ash That shades the roador setting up a cottage Planned in a government officeshorten his lifeManacle his soul upon the Red Sea bottomDE BOSSCHERE S STUDY OF ELSKAMPEzra Pound I CONFESSED in my February essay my inability to make anything of Max Elskamp s poetryand I have tacitly confessed my inability to find any formula for hawking De Bosschère s own verse to any public of my aquaintanceDe Bosschère s study of Elskamphoweverrequires no advocacyI do not think it even requires to be a study of Max Elskampit drifts as quiet canal waterthe protagonist may or not be a real man Icila solitude est plus acentuéesouventpendant de longues minutesles rues sont désertesLes portes ne semblent pasainsi que dans les grandes villess ouvrir sur un poumon de vieet être une cellule vivante de la rueAu contrairetoutes sont ferméesAussi bienles façades de ce quartier sont pareilles aux murs borgnesUn mince ruban de ciel roux et grisà peine bleu au printempsdéMax Elskamp essai par Jean De BosschèreBibliothèque de l Occident17 rue EbléParisfr3 50The Little Review coupe les pignonsse tend sur le marché désert et sur le puits profond des cours From this AntwerpDe Bosschère derives his subjectas Gautier hisAlbertusfrom Un vieux bourg flamand tel que peint Tènierstrees bathing in water Son univers était limité par le grand peuplier une statue de Pomone le grand rocher etlà grand greniuille ceci était un coin touffu où il y avait de l eau et où il ne vit jamais qu une seule grenouillequ il croyait immortelle De Bosschère s next vision of Elskamp is when his subject is pointed out asle poète décadent for no apparent reason save that he read Mallarmé at a time when Antwerp did notThe study breaks into a cheerful grin when Elskamp tells of Mallarmé s one appearance in the sea port Le bruit et les cris qui furent poussés pendant la conférence de Mallarmél arrêtèrent plusieurs foisL opinion du public sur sa causerie est contenue en ces quelques motsdits par un général retraitégrand joueur de billardet qui du reste ne fit qu une courte absence de la salle de jeupour écouter quelques phrases du poète Cet homme est îvre ou fou dit il fort hauten quittant la salleoù son jugement fit loiAnversmalgré un léger masque de snobismequi pourrait trompern a pas changé depuisMallarmémême pour les a vertisest toujours l homme îvre ou fou The billard player is the one modern touch in the bookfor the rest Elskamp sails with sea captainsapparently in sailing ships to Constantinopleor perhaps one should call it ByzantiumHe reads Juan de la Cruz and Young s Night Thoughtsand volumes of demonologyin the properly dim library of his maternal grandfather Sa passion en rhétorique fut pour Longfellowil traduisaitSong ofsicHiawatotsThe further one penetrates into De Bosschère s delightful narrative the less real is the herothe less he needs to be realA phantom has been called out of De Foe s perioddelightful phantomtaking on the reality of the fictitiousin the end the author has created a charming figurebut I am as far as ever from making head or tail of the verses attributed to this creationI have had a few hoursdelightful readingI have loitered along slow canalsbehind a small window sits Elskamp doing something I do not in the least understandThe Little Review 7 II So was I at the end of the first divisionSur la Viede Max ElskampThe second divisionconcerned withOeuvre et Vie but raised again the questions that had faced me in reading Elskamp s printed workHe has an undercurrentan element everywhere presentdifferentiating his poems from other men s poemsDe Bosschere scarcely helps me to name itThe third division of the bookat first readingnearly quenched the curiosity and the interest aroused by the first two thirdsOn second reading I thought better of itElskampplunged in the middle agesin what seems almost an atrophyas much as an atavismbecame a little more plausible For what is it worthI read the chapter upon a day of almost complete exhaustionOrquand la vision lâche comme une proie vidée le saintil demeure avec les hommesEntre le voyant et ceux qui le sanctifient il y a un précipice insondableSeul l individu est béatifié par sa croyancemais il ne peut l utiliser au temporel ni la partager avec les hommeset c est peut être la forme unique de la justice sur terre The two sentences give us perhaps the tone of De Bosschère s critiqueSur le Mysticismeof ElskampIt is however not in De Bosschérebut in La Wallonie that I found the clue to this authorConsolatrice des Affliges Et l hiver m a donné la mainJ ai la main d Hiver dans les mainset dans ma têteau loinil brûle les vieux étés de caniculeet dans mes yeuxen candeurs lentestrès blanchement il fait des tentesdans mes yeux il

un voyage au vent sur les vaisseaux de mes lits blancs qui houlent avec des étoiles à l entour de toutes les voilesor j ai le goût de mer aux lèvres comme une rancoeur de genièvre bu pour la très mauvaise orgie des départs dans les tabagiespuis ce pays encore me vientun pays de neiges sans finMarie des bonnes couverturesfaites y la neige moins dure et courir moins comme des lières mes mains sur mes draps blancs de fièvreMax Elskamp inLa Wallonie 1892The poem appears in Van Bever and Léautaud s anthology and there may be no reason for my not having thence received itbut there isfor all thata certain value in finding a man among his native surroundingsand in finding Elskamp at homeamong his contemporariesI gained first the advantage of comprehensionLittle Review PROSE POEMS John Rodker Theseus WHEN the brass door of the labyrinth clanged behind him he was in darknessThe noise reverberated in his ears and grew fainterlike an omen called from hill top to hill top till it died ten thousand miles into the heart of a continentHe waited for the last echo to fadefor the hollow sound lay about him like a wild beast s eyesBut however faint and ultimate the hullo ing grewalways further and fainter and more ominousanother echo wokeHe waited an eternityThe last remote vibration diedHe put one foot forwardstealthily and so faintly that an effort to strain his ears to catch the soundseemed to burst a blood vessel deep in his brainanother echo awokeHe could not stand it Haiahe shouted into the dark Haia determined to kill forever that globular and staring echoThe sound went crashing along the dark galleriesand came spitting and crashing back to him like thunderand ready to bring the walls down about himHe was afraid and lifted his shield above his head Mother he criedinstinctivelyHe began to go forwardHis feet made no soundhe could see nothingWhen he touched the wall he drew his hand awayit was wet and slimy and felt like a snake s skinSometimes he turned right anglesfollowing the wallsIt did not matterHe tried not to think of the approaching encounterso that he might reserve his strengthbut in its place he only saw Ariadne whom he hatedHe tried to think of the girl he had left behindbut her face had grown vague and her eyes ghostlyStill he marched onAt first he had walked warilydreading surprise at each momentbut as he saw that the corridors were only a man s breadth he regained confidenceHe walked till each step had become automaticHe had forgotten whether he walked or notOnly if he stopped could he knowbutthis did not occur to himA sudden turn brought him up sharpand he stoppedThe muscles of his legs and calves began to twitch spasmodically and with excruciating painHe was forced to go on10 The Little Review Still the dark heldand though he strained his eyes to see what lay before himhe only saw lines of white fire darting across his sightand these burst with a little splatter when they reached the edge of his retinaAt first he thought he was seeing lightthen he knew that the gods were laughing at himHe saw pale outlines of a stomach appear on the dark before himand it was like a drawing on a slateHe knew by that he was hungryHis bowels began to gripecaling for foodand the peristalt drew for him a figure 8with the long axis lying horizontalThe motion of each foot as it touched ground translated itself into a circle of fireflashing first on one side of his brain and then on the otherHe did not know if he walked or notHe felt his eyes bursting from his headPurkinje s figures danced before himmaking a pink hazeThere was a little tug behind him and a cord snappedDancer Gyroscope hums immutably through buttocks threatens and terrifies pervading obscure oscillationA world set into motionuncontrollableBut

overcomeHe grew sad when he thought of his herosometimes even weptOften he said to himself Therebut for the grace of Godgoes Then the play was staged and was an instant successTouring companies were sent outtranslations madeThe play was performed in every capital in EuropeBut the Dramatist had forgotten the old playfor he was working on anotherAnd every night while the Dramatist sleptateentertainedlovedat eight o clock precisely a certain theatre in London would be filled with beautiful women in beautiful wrapsvirile men in evening dressshop girls and clerks in the galleryAt 8 10 his hero would walk on the stagetake off hisgibuswith verve and develop his partThe heroine would fling herself into his armsthreaten suicidein short be adorableThe whole long play would be gone throughword for word as it had been writtenwith exactly the right curve of wrist for holding a cigaretteTo the Dramatistwhen he thought about itthese were people he had met vaguely at dinnerOn the Continent at varying times the same scene was enactedThe same sort of theatre was filled with the same sort of people who were shown the play exactly as if had been writtenword for wordAnother replica of the heroan identical heroineangry12 The Little Review sobbingdespairingThe same emotions evoked all over the worldAnd every eveningwhile the author of their being sleptateloved or entertainedsomewhere a thousand miles away a beautifulstraight and immaculate hero would suddenly break off his own sleepingeatingentertaining or loving to knock at a doorwalk on to a stagethrow hisgibuson to a divanand pull up his trousers a little at the knee before he knelt to make his grand declaration of passionEvery eveninga hundred similar heroes and heroines all over the worldIt was like an action thatonce donegoes careering through space forever and foreverBut the Dramatist was working on a new playHe had forgotten what his old play was aboutHe even repeated one of the sceneswith a differenceTheatre Muet The curtain is raised upon Autumn and closely interwoven treesDead leaves in profusionBehind is seen a long field with stocks of corn which mist is clottingBehind mountainsCurtain dropsThe curtain is raised again and a woman is standing beneath the treeshalf in shadowIt is the first phase of twilightEvidently she is waitingThe mist grows denser and gradually envelopes the trees so that the woman is blotted outThe trees multiply rapidlyshe is in a dense thicketclearing disappears the mist risesSteps are heard in the leaves the trees dwindlethey be some bushesThe sky grows darker but clearer the evening star ascendsA man and she rushes to meet himEverything quickly blots out in curtain of black and yellow with spots and streaks that whirl excentrically as they embraceThis disappears as they draw apartTrees gradually climb higher again and while they regard each other the landscape resumes its appearance as at the opening of the sceneThey approach and seize each otherThe swirl of colour The Little Review 13 again appears but with the original landscape diminished upon itThey separateThey have become colossal in comparison with what is around thembut gradually as they are sucked into it the trees resume their normal sizethe mist creeps out thicklyIt grows darker with more starsThe time for parting approachesThe trees grow higher and higherbecome a thick forestvery coldThe mist threads the trunks milkilyIt is evident he must goThey embraceand for a moment the trees seem to dwindle and then shoot up terrifically engulfing herShe cowersRustling of leaveshis receding footstepsAfter Hafiz Iris Barry Dawn seemed so slow in coming the earliest hour of morning drove me to the garden as mad as a nightingale for the comfort of the rosesMy rose loomed through the dusk like a red lam of lovelinessproud of her youthcareless of the notes of her lovers the birdsat her feet the tulip s heart was stained with stripes of passion and the narcissus dropped tears of envy from her dark eyesI cried to my rose LailaI too would be tranquil as your sweet silken robe Might I like it enfold you AlasHer breast and shoulderher breast and shoulder have quite ruined my heartI ask of the nightingales what remedy for a poor loverAltogether they sing sadlyHer sweet mouthher desired mouth 14 The Little Review POEMS Jean de

with his speechAnd let our crooked smokesNoble words comingLook outCould you try your hand at it yourselfAnd it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like

graciousness not often employed by English and American writers in communication to their juniorsIndeed the present elder generation of Americanrespectableauthors having all their lives approached so nearly to deathhave always been rather annoyed that American letters did not die utterly in their personal dessicationsSigns of vitalitysigns of interest inor cognizance ofother sections of this

Mockel is represented by several poems rather too long to quote Chantefable un peu naiveL Atithése suggestive of the Gourmont litanyby prose commentby work over various pseudonyms A Clair Matinis a suitable length to quoteand it is better perhaps to represent him here by it than by fragments which I had first intended to cut from his longer poemsA Clair Matin La nuit au loin s est effacée comme

fascimile92I have left Gide and Van Lerberghe unquotedunmentionedbut I haveI dare saygiven poems enough to indicate the quality and the scope of the poetry in La WallonieIn prose their cousinage is perhaps more quickly apparentAlmost the first sentence I come uponI suspect it is Mockel sruns as follows La Revue des deux Mondes publie un roman de Georges Ohnetce qui ne surprendra personneThis is the proper tone to use when dealing with elderly mutton headswith the Harpers of yester yearLa Wallonie found it out in the eightiesThe symboliste movement flourished on itAmerican letters did not flourishpartly perhaps for the lack of itand for the lack of unbridled uncompromising magazines run by young men who did not care for reputations surfaitesfor elderly stodge and stupidityIf we turn to Mockel s death notice for Jules Laforgue we will find La Wallonie in87 awake to the value of contemporary achievementJules Laforgue Nous apprenons avec une vive tristessela mort de Jules Laforguel un

Bienle VraiO parfumsô regardsô foissoitj essaieraiVaque ta seule étude Soit de vivre sans but fou de mansuétudeAlbert Mockel inLa Wallonie 1887I have quoted but sparinglyand I have thought quotation better than commentbut despite the double meagreness I think I have given evidence that La Wallonie was worth editingIt began as L Elan Littéraire with 16 pagesand an edition of 200 copiesit should convince any but the most stupid that size is not the criterion of permanent valueand that a small magazine may outlast much bulkier printingsAfter turning the pages of La Wallonieperhaps after reading even this so brief excerptone is ready to see some sense in even so lyric a phrase astemps doréde ferveur et de belle confiance In their seven yearsrun these editorsone at least beginning in histeens had published a good deal of the best of Verhaerenhad published work by ElskampMerrillGriffinLouysMaeterlinckVerlaineVan LerbergheGustave KahnMoreasQuillardAndré Gidehad been joined in their editing board by De Régnier remember that they edited in Liègenot in Paristhy were not at the hub of the universebut in the heart of French Belgium they had not made any compromisePermanent literatureand the seeds of permanent literaturehad gone through proof sheets in their officeThere is perhaps no greater pleasure in lifeand there certainly can have been no greater enthusiasm than to have been young and to have been part of such a group of writers working in fellowship at the beginning of such a courseof such a series of courses as were implicated in La WallonieIf the date is
