SHOULD be very glad if someone in America could be made to realize the sinister bearing of the import duty on booksI have tried in vain to get some of my other correspondents to understand the effect of this iniquity but apparently without successIt means insularitystupiditybacking the printer against literaturecommerce and obstruction against intelligenceI have spent myself on the topic so many times that I am not minded to write an elaborate denunciation until I know I am writing to someone capable of understanding and willing to take up the battleIncidentally the life of a critical review depends a good deal on controversy and on having some issue worth fightingHenry IVdid away with the black mediaevalism of an octroi on booksand the position of Paris is not without its debt to that intelligent actNo country that needs artificial aid in its competition with external intelligence is fit for any creature above the status of pigThe tariff should be abolished not only for itself but because dishonest booksellers shelter themselves behind it and treble the price of foreign booksand because it keeps up the price of printingIf there is one thing that we are all agreed upon It is that the canned goods of Curtis and Company and Harper and Company and all the business firms should be set apart from the art of lettersand the artist helped against the tradesmanAs a matter of fact a removal of the tariff wouldn t much hurt even publishersas the foreign books we really want in America are the sort which the greed of American business publishers forbids their publishing but that is no matterIt affects every young writer in Americaand every reader whether he wish merely to train his perceptions or whether he train them with a purposeofsaylearning what has been donewhat need not be repeatedwhat is worthy of repetitionThere is now the hideous difficulty of getting a foreign bookand the prohibitive price of both foreign and domestic publicationsI don t know that I need to go on with itAgain and yet again it is preposterous that our generation of writers shouldn t have the facility in getting at contemporary workwhich one would have in Paris or MoscowIt s bad enough for the American to struggle against the dead hand of the past generation composed of clerks and parasites and against our appalling decentralizationie lack of metropoles and centershaving full publishing facilities and communication with the outer worldwhich last is being slowly repairedalso our scarcity of people who knowWhen all the world goes madone must accept madness as sanitysince sanity isin the last analysisnothing but the madness on which the whole world happens to agreeBernard Shaw19169 The Little Review A Sorrowful DemonALEXANDER SKAUN HOW he hates usordinary mortals Nohe seldom hates he reserves his hatred for Godfor lifefor the universeFor usweak bubbles driven on the surface by uncontrollable forceshe has only contemptYetthough hating and despisinghe is infinitely dear to usthe thick melancholy vein that bulges across his wildcat forehead makes him almost humanthe taut string of his remote harp vibrates at times with such yearning and pain that we feel nearly at home with that alien on earthMikhail LermontovWe are glad with a petty gladness whenever we discover in him this weaknesshis humaneness we chuckle at the comfortable feeling of being able to observe him on the level planefreed from the necessity of throwing our heads far back in order to perceive him on the lonely peakHe is our brotherwe boast and we inflict on him the severest punishment for a genius

our terrestrial standards to tolerate an individual who is made not of the same stuff that we are made ofLermontov was a child of a different planet who fell upon our earth by some crude mistakedoomed to chafe twenty six years among humansAs a child he protested against the fatal misplacementhe discharged his venom in demolishing flower bedsin torturing animals with tears in his eyesin brandishing his tiny fists against his grandmotherwhen he observed her mistreating the serfsWhen he grew up and he grew up early at ten he loved a girl at fifteen he conceived his greatest poemsMtzyri and Demon his protest had calmed downHe no longer wept or raged he hated God and despised mankindHis contemporaries tell us that no one could stand his heavy penetrating lookMen hated and feared himwomen hated and loved himas they always do extraordinary thingsLermontov took revenge for his accidental association with mankindhe left behind him a long row of broken hearts and wounded ambitionsHis rebellious

not talk muchhe is too aristocratic for extravagance in wordsPechorin does not compromisehe is not made of that stuffHe neither repents nor seeks atonementin his hatred for reality he does not erect a

his unhuman flameAlonein the steppeafter a mad ride which kills his horsePechorin hugs the soil and weepslike a child Like a child pressing to its mother s bosomplaintively demanding the Why and the Wherefore of existence among strangersShall we chuckle at the suddenly discovered weakness of our enemyOr shall we modestly turn away our eyes from the stolen sight of a god in his nudityI once called

Chicago just now who understand and enjoy Amy Lowell s poetry because she read it to them at the Little TheatreI know a poet who could make nothing of Vachel Lindsay s things until Lindsay chanted them to him one dayAnd I know another who said to mewhen I remarked that I didn t like Alfred Kreymborg s verse Ohbut you would if you knew him I am puzzledbecause I know this man to be an intelligent beingAnd somehow I have always been under the naive impression that poetry was a matter of artBut there are worse thingsThere is one type of person we always eject promptly from the office of THE LITTLE REVIEWHe is the person who says that Amy Lowell s poetry has no feeling in itNow please listen I want to quote you somethingIt is called Vernal Equinoxit was written by Miss Lowelland it appeared in the September issue of Poetrybut I want to see it put down in these pages so that we may actually know it has been in TH E LITTLE REVIEW The scent of hyacinthslike a pale mistlies between me my bookthe South Windwashing through the roomthe candles quivernerves sting at a spatter of rain on the shutterI am uneasy at the bursting of green shoots in the nightare you not here to overpower me with your tense and urgent loveA poet whose new book will soon be talked of said to mewhenshowed this to him Yesit s very cleverbut it has no feeling He left the office gladly in three minutesStill there are worse thingsThe Chicago Tribune sent a reporter to the Little Theatre to hear Miss Lowell read and to record his impression of her work and personality for those who still peruse the newspapersYou may have seen the reporter s articleAnd still worseLots of people have been splitting hairs over Amy Lowell s workbut no human being has been heard to remark A beautiful thing is happening in AmericaAmy Lowell is writing poetry for us PoemsELIZABETH GIBSON CHEYNE The Cry Whenever there is silence around meday or by nightam startled by the cry me down from the cross first time I heard it went out and searched I found a man in the throes of crucifixionI said I will take you down I tried to take the nails out of his feethe saidLet beI cannot be taken down every manevery womanand every child together to take me down I said But I cannot bear your crycan I do he saidGo about the worldeveryone you meet is a man upon the cross13 The Little Review The Excuse I go about the world Telling all the richAnd all the happyand all the comfortable There is a man upon the cross But they all sayWe are sure you are mistakenThere was a man upon the cross Two thousand years ago But he diedand was taken down And was decently buriedAnd a miracle happenedSo that he rose again And ascended into HeavenAnd is happy evermore Still I go about the world sayingThere is a man upon the cross The Cross Any groveller May be straightened by a cross If he lies down upon it at nightAnd sleeps upon it with outstretched arms If he rises inthe morningAnd shoulders it bravelyNeither resenting it Nor being ashamed of itHe will find that he can bring his eyes To look upon life Instead of upon the graveAnd that he will even be able To lift them to the stars And that he can live On the levels he is able to look upon I do not know whether these poems have been published elsewhere or notThey were read by Ellen Gates Starr in a mass meeting in Kent Theatre on the University of Chicago campus a mass meeting in protest against police brutality during the garment strikeThe Little Review What Then RGTHERE are signs of life at the Art InstituteIn throwing out Charles Kinneyit stated the case against itself more emphatically than Kinney ever could have doneWhen aninstitutionbecomes violent over criticism there is too much work for one reformerThis seems to have been a season for things Art to be stating the case against themselvesAt the last meeting of the Chicago Society of Artistswhen there was a slight murmur of dissatisfaction with the management of the Instituteone of the older men quickly reminded the painters that they were but guests of the Institute and there was silenceArt has come by hard waysbut never to worse than thisthe guest of the Corn Exchange Bank Again at a meeting for the formation of the new Arts Clubbefore the matter of the Club could be discussed there had to be a speech assuring the Art Institute that the artists would neverin any wayever do anything on their ownbut would always conform to the ideas of the directors of the InstituteBut where they really proved themselves was at the annual dinnerat the opening of the Chicago ArtistsExhibitionHerded into a room they meekly submitted to oyster stew and a speech by a minister of the GospelArtists That is their case as stated by themselvesKinney blames the directors pro tem and the Deanfor thefactory systemin the schoolKnowing that all the small towns in the West and Middle West having any kind of an Art School pattern after the Art Institutehe is excited and fears the factory system will prevail everywhereBut he might have hope that here and there accidentally a few artists may get mixed up among the other students and frustrate this planIt would be interesting to know whether the administration by its methods has so completely discouraged artists that they no longer seek the Art Institute as a place of studyor whether the administration is simply changing its methods to meet the demands of the kind of student now attending the InstituteThis much is certain no administration could take away every ancient perogative of art students lead them gently into organization impose discipline upon them and appoint God a chaperone over their play in fact make a crèche of the school if there were any of the stuff in them of which artists are madeThere always has been a fight on the part of the school to get what it wanted from the directors but things can be doneRead the list ofillustrious namesof visiting instructorsyears agoand then compare the student roll of the same timeOnce the Art Institute was an art school with art studentswho were artistswho in spite of everything led the life of artistsknew the analogy between painting and the other Artsswarmed to concerts and the theatresand created their own atmosphereThat was the time when Bernhardt came to the school in her yellow wheeled carriage and walked down a double line of quakingadoring art studentsAnd when Calvé came to singHow many students there now know these namesknow anything beyond fashion drawingThey have indicted themselvesIf there were artists the Art Institute could seek exhibitionsIf there were art students we could have an art schoolnot afactory And if the directors of the Art Institute and its patrons really wanted Artand the directors would throw the Institute open to all kinds of exhibitionswe might even in time find ArtGerman Poetry WILLIAM SAPHIER LEARNED essays on this or that poetry make little red devils dance in my brain and my right hand reach for a Japanese swordThey are invariably inferior to the spiritand occupy only a small section of the horizon of their subjectI have translated these three poems because I felt that they were as good or better than the best things published in this countryand because so little is known of this kind of German poetry hereThe first is by Julius Berstl and the second two are by Fritz SchnackI know of many morebut I am unable to get their work just nowAs you perhaps knowthey are engaged at present in a different directionHighlandFrom the German of Julius BerstlEarly light reflexes

dream and see visionsMuch was said about Utopias and the New Jerusalemand poetry languished in the youth that he might materialize some ultimate world stateThe most inexcusable optimism of them allRome was not built in a day Truebut it was builtnot merely talked about or prophesiedAnd the youth remembered not that it hath been said in Isaiah ForbeholdI create a new heaven and a new earthand the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind Yet the youth remembered the former still and did say much about the recoming of those civilizations which had beenat last to stay foreverHis

brought forward so dogmatically Nowthe Arts are complete in themselves they contain allThe moving picture has come to be a parasite on themSculpture has become a vital thing to this age because of August RodinMuenier has moved us tooAlso Monolo and FagiNow comes Lindsay I desire for the moving picture not the stillness but the majesty of sculpture Not the mood of Venus de Milobut let us turn to that sister of hers the great Victory of Samothrace I have seen much of Lindsay s advice followed word for word since this book of his was publishedTyrone Power in The Dream of Eugene AraamPower s face and figure were more majestic on the stage than in this pictureThere was asculpture group as you would call itin this picture a farmer and two squires on a hilltopIt was in silhouettea sketch and

pictures and not sculpture says Lorado Taft in a public statementobjecting to Lindsay s phrase To a sculptor the one thing cherished as most essential to his art is its static qualityits look of

a year in prison for her crimeThat is something none of us could face without a kind of insanitySo please don t be content with merely abusing the government send your protests to the District Attorney and it may help a great dealAny one who wishes to arrange for further lectures by MrsSanger may write to Fania Mindellcare TH E LITTLE Review The Rupert Brooke Memorial IT has been decided to

into wordsBut I am free to tell myself and let me but preserve the senses my eyesmy earsmy touchand all shall be well all shall seem far more beautiful than terrible Gordon CraigOnly fanaticism is possible for phlegmatic naturesNietzsche Flamingo Dreams LUPO DE BRAILA A BURST of passion in a pagan god s eye was the sunrise as I saw it from the top of Mount Rose one morning last summerTrembling and with squinting eyes I looked at the grand spectaclefearing to go blind if I opened my eyesThe sun stretched its arms and with flaming fingers lifted the bluish grey blanket from the Nevada hills and the Truckee ValleyFeeling that the beauty of this moment could not be surpassedI turned my face toward California and ran down the western side of Mount RoseOne day last week when the massive shoulders of Jerome Blum stepped in between me and a canvas that had transformed his studio into a strange land for meI wanted to hold his hands for fear the next canvas would take the joy produced by the one in front of meHe came back from an eight monthstrip through Japan and China recentlyand he brought with him over twenty paintings with pulsating nature and unrestrained joy in every one of themThe rhythmic lines dance through the curling roofs and weird trees and all of them are bathed in sunshineAt the same time they are a close study of this strange landits people and their habitsby a forecful and unusual artist a man who saysyesto nature in no uncertain termsHis bold colors are handled in a most sensitive mannerand when I wanted to place him among the Chicago artists I found that he belongs to an entirely different class and could not even be compared to some of the vacillating and doubtful men who paint in this townHe has a portrait of a Chinese girl in a green gownand some scenes along a canal and in a Chinese gardenthat have tempted my usually honest mind to some queer contemplationsI have found myself wandering to the windows and other unusual entrances to his studiofiguring out how one might find access to that place without a key and at a certain dark hourI have only one hope left now of owning one in a figurative wayand it is that the trustees of the Art Institute may see the light and I hope Jerome Blum will not be compelledlike some of the best men this country has producedto go to other shores to gain the recognition due a man of his abilityA few weeks ago I saw one of the older trustees spend considerable time before a canvas by a Boston painter that lacked all that goes to make a work of arta canvas on which the artistwith the aid of a pointed stickhad tried to prod his dead and colorless paint into some kind of motionIn spite of this I still believe that they will rise to the high intellectual and artistic understanding that they are supposed to possessbut which they have failed to display up to the presentas far as modern art is concernedIt is impossible for me to describe any of Blum s canvases except to say that they tear you away from the dirty grey and ill smelling Chicagoto a country you have seen in your dreams as a childWe will have a chance to see this artist s workbeginning April fifteenthat O Brien son Michigan BoulevardLucille Swan Blum will exhibit at the same time and place some very graceful Japanese dancersChinese childrenCoreanChineseand Japanese mothers with their babies and other far eastern

far as space and time allow ALLAN ROSS MACDOUGALL FROM my garret window I look out on Washington SquareSnow and ice still lie thereand the trees are black and meanOn the first page of his new bookMoby Lane and Thereabouts Neil Lyons saysSpring has many ushersand is heralded by divers signsSome people look for these signs among the hedgerows others seek them in the skyor listen for them in the nightwhilst other people neither look or listenbut go smelling aboutor stand upon hill topstasting My sign shall beI thinkthe grimy trees of the SquareAnd sometimes as I sit here looking out on the icy barrenness I wonder ifwhen Spring s breath does touch the earthwhether flowers will come up flowers that I long to see crocusesanemonesdaffodilsIt s all very well to see them in shop windowsbut God to see them come up out of the earth and unfold But I fear our Square is too sophisticatedI know a man will come a common tobacco chewing man with a stunted soul who belongs to a Union and gets paid so much coin by the hour and he will arrange squaresand oblongsand diamond shaped plots of earthThen will he proceed laboriously and without joy to stick tulips or some other straight official flower into these geometricalsoulless patternsAnd throughout the year in the Squarenature will be kept in bounds and orders Henry VIIIIt seems scarcely possible that Sir Herbert Tree would have the calm artistic audacity to come to this country and present his production ofHenry VIIIin the moth eaten scenery and costumes that were used in the London production in the year 1910Yet he didand oh the wearisome drab antiquity of it all But thePeopleliked it and gave the be knighted actor managerone of the greatest premieres that New York has witnessed these many years Mention is made in the programme ofthe inspiring aerchiological adviceof Percy MacquoidRIThe advice may have been quite inspiringI do not doubt itBut the results of that adviceThat medley of costumesThose photo scenes of Windsor Castle and Blackfriars Hall and The Little Review Westminster AbbeyThey were bad when first conceived and paintedand five years in a London storeroom has not improved them to any degree compatible with their presentation to an audience that has looked upon the work of BasktUrbanJonesSimeand RothensteinAnd what can be said of the lighting There was one comic spotlight that followed Sir Herbertor ought I to say WolseyI hardly know they were never quite distinctaround the stage like a little motherless puppySometimes it went beforesometimes it frisked afteron the tail of his magnificent scarlet gownIt had a grand timeBut it never seemed to be doing the thing it ought to be doingBut let me not bore you as these things bored mePass we now to the actingIn London the honors of the play were carried off by Arthur Bouchier as Henryand his wifeViolet Vanburghas KatherineA repetition was performed hereLyn Harding as Henryand Edith Wynne Matheson as Katherinecarried every one before themAnd TreeWellhe had his momentsThere was his superb entrance with the look he flashed at Buckinghamfine too was the acting in the scene of his downfallBetween these two highlights such ordinary acting has seldom been seen in a man of Tree s reputationIn a cold classic way Miss Matheson was splendidI liked her muchand but for her some of the scenes in the play would have been colourlessThere was the usual mob of supers who got caught in doorways and tripped over furniturebut on the whole they behaved as well as an ordinary stage manager can make such people behaveYvette Guilbert Five years ago I saw Yvette Guilbert in LondonI loved her allHer red hair the skinny arms of herclothed in long black gloves and her Gallic body with the low necked white crinoline that gowned itAnd how she sang And her acting For five years I have carried the memory of her around with mematching other people up with her but never finding her equalOn SundayMarch nineteenthI saw her againThe black gloves and the white Crinoline were goneand she had grown a little stouterThe red hair was thereand the smileHer voice had changed a bit and her personality had mellowedShe sang songs that were grave and movinglike Fiona Macleod s Prayer of Womenand others that were gay and jocularlike The Curé ServantBut whatever she sang and I didn t know a word of what she sang carried me away completelyNot a mood did I miss not a suggestion of a moodPerfect is her artShe has my adoration The Merry Wives of WindsorThe latest addition to the Shakespeare Festival that is being thrust upon the apathetic people of this place is the Hackett Allen production of The Merry Wives of WindsorThree things can be said without any further commentJoseph Urban did the stage settingsRichard Ordynski directed the productionWilly Pogany designed the costumesGordon Craig says somewhere that any medium is easier to work in than human beingsAfter seeing the work expended on The Merry Wives of Windsor by three geniusesand watching the actors in that playwe understand completelySoulless New York Witter Bynnergrown somber and blasethe effect of living in soulless New Yorkhe says has become a sort of Greek Chorus to meIn various strophes with divers variationsin sundry public and private placeshe chants the dismal fact that New York is soulless and that there is a danger of it robbing me of my joy in lifeNot while its streets remain as they are will I lose the joy I possessI cannot remember any city that I have been in where my sense of the comic has been tickled so often by happenings in the streetsSo many comedies are enacted by the curbstoneso many quaintly funny things happen every hour on the streetsthat it would be impossible for me to forget how jolly life really isOf course I see tragedies toobut they seem to be there only for the purpose of balance For some time to come I ll Dalcroze down the avenues and numerical by ways of thissoullesscityAnd my smile will always be handy

Reinhardt Sarah Bernhardt has been playing a patriotic playLes Cathedralesin London It is such a great play I intend taking it into the provinces and then back to London again she saysWe have said it is a patriotic playnothing more need be saidBernhardt plays one of the seven cathedralsStrasburgIn the interviewquoted abovegiven to the London magazineDrawingBernhardt has also this to say And nowit seems to me that artists in the Allied Countriesand also authorspainterscomposersand all those concerned in the theatre have to bind themselves into a league for removing all traces of German nature and influence from our plays and theatres Now the German showman Reinhardt flooded Paris and London with the Berliner deluge of the spectacularHe claims artistic superiority on the grounds of having introduced several novel trivialitiesBut to trace the real curve of truth I must say that he did nothing of the kindHe merely revivedin Sumurun and Oedipus Rexcertain outworn conventions which existed before his timeBut he has not the honesty to acknowledge it Later she does say something worth thinking over What he has done is to use Eastern methods for Western ideas when he should have used Eastern ideas for Western methods Plagiarism is an irrelevant charge to bring against an artistbut acknowledging an artistic right to adaptation means expansion anddespite nationalisma universal one

Isaac DisraeliUntermeyer s verseincluding Challenge and that so quantitatively published in the magazines still speaking comparativelyhas the same relation to poetry as Urban s scenery for The Follies has to his Boston Opera settingsor of all of Urban s work to that of the numerous German poster school of five or eight years agoUntermeyer is lenient in parodying poets of his own ilk but it is easy to determine which of those he does not respect by his obviousspiteful absurditiesFor years now newspaper paragraphers poets and editors have been saying such things asIt is time we are getting ourselves talked aboutwhen mentioning Ezra PoundUntermeyer stoops to ithe is still theonce born when beingcriticalabout Amy LowellA blue herring sings What he is really parodying here is his colleague Walt Mason s prose printed jingles which are syndicated throughout newspaperdom he is not giving acritical expositionof polyphonic proseIt will need a keener critic or poet than he to do it or to produce a parody or satire whose art equals that of the thing satired Masters s things for exampleBy ambling through thirty seven lines Untermeyer imagines that he is being master of the situation as regards MastersAnd the last line of the parody on James Oppenheim might very well have been written by Untermeyer himself as one of his ownClad in the dazzling splendor of my awakened selfNo matter

happy until he has lost himself in an art that issomething more than an audible dramatization of human life Perhaps he is rightButBut butSometimes I know that for the greatest artist there would be no chasm between what the heart desires and what the mind constructsTell me how to do that in poetry and I ll give you a dollarPerhaps it can be done in music I don t knowBut in poetry the human heart and the mathematical soul are always fighting and so far as I know they have not yet come to an agreement not in English poetryat leastThe artist and the human being never get to be bedfellowsIt s

handto lead them to the Promised Land of happiness and content and physical and mental health has been well illustrated in a poemrecently published in TH E LITTLE REVIEWChicago wherein the authoressMary Aldisunwittingly indicts the whole medical profession for still allowing the sale of a patent medicine to reduce obesityThe strange title of the poem in homely and unadornedfree verseisEllie The Tragic Tale of An Obese Girl MrsAldis thus runs the poem had a manicurist who wasa great big lummox of a girl a continent withsilly bulging cheeks and puffy forehead and who one day said to the poetessweeping and distraught I m so fatso awfulawful fatThe boys won t look at me She asked MrsAldis for help and MrsAldis suggested A doctor s vague advice to bant and exercise andEllie and her woes passed from my mindUntilas summer dawned againI heard that she was dead MrsAldis went to the funeral and saw Ellie lying in her coffin and was told by Elbe s mother She must a made itthe dressby herselfIt s queer it fitted perfectlyAnher all thin like that Later in the evening MrsAldis received the following confidences from Elbe s motherTwas the stuff she took that did itI never knew till after she was deadThe bottles in the woodshedhundreds ofemAll labelledCaldwel s Great Obesity Cure Warranted Safe and Rapid To sermonize herewe have MrsAldiswho we know to be a highly intelligent woman and one not only interested in the uplift of the drama but also in the uplift of the common peoplemerely saying to a girlwho is wretchedly unhappy about her elephantine size All that I can give you is a doctor s vague advice to bant and exerciseShe might have given her Vance Thompson s epoch making bookEat and Grow Thin or read chapters from it to the unhappy girlthereby convincing her that starvation is unnecessary and also a patent medicineBut with a coldness that is most reprehensiveshe gavea doctor s vague advice to bant and exercise and evidently Ellie would none of thisShe might also have consulted the hundred and one doctors in Chicago or elsewhere who specialize in the reduction of fatand who could have given her forthe continenta diet chart or perhaps a pill to effect the desired changeBut she did not think this necessaryshe did not feel it her dutyBut if we have only adverse criticism for MrsAldisuncharitable actwhat direful words of commination should we not visit on the doctor who gave thevague advice In an age when the cult of slimness is uppermost in everybody s mindis it possible that the doctor consulted by MrsAldis was so untrue to his mission as a public benefactor that he gave onlyvague advice or is MrsAldis maligning the whole medical profession and trying to show that by hisvague advicethe doctor was really responsible for Elbe s death by driving her into takingthe bottles in the woodshedhundreds ofemAll labelledCaldwell s Great Obesity Cure Warranted Safe and RapidThe lesson contained in the poetic lines of MrsAldislittle tragedy is a bitter one for all those medical men who have made strenuous efforts to let the public share their deep and vast knowledge without so much as asking for the slightest compensationIt shows beyond a doubt that not only are the Ellies of this world unwilling to imbibe science in a popular formbut also the Aldises of a much higher intelligenceIt shows that the lure of patent medicine is a very strong one and that a doctor svague advicecannot offset itStrangeindeedthat a doctor svague adviceshould be so inconsequential opposite so patently fraudulent a preparation asCaldwell s Great Obesity Cure but stranger still is what we are about to record namelythe failure of our medical propagandists to combat in an intelligent way that most simple of all our metabolic disturbances obesityThe Little Review
