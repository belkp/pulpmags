her head the low swinging boughs And they kept the weeds cut better Noise of waves Wind running through the tree tops the speed of salt tasting Wind parting the boughs and the weeds about her knees I begin to say I lived in this place all one year Before I was grown and you were that one of them The girl nearly grown who stood beside the weed fire In only a blue dress and that dirty The wind Wrapped it on your body and wound it like fire Like a fire in grass You were that one who cried That she was eating wind You had a red mouth You had a red mouth your short hair wound over your face  117  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  As the flame did around your legs Thin girl Sharp voiced in the smoke screaming loud as a hawk The smoke follows the beauty There was a young man With you I forget his name  Are you that brother The little boy who lay bellied against the grass Staring and staring at us and at the sky Where birds climbed and looked down When we left  the fire You turned your face to the wet grass in the ditch And whispered Like like like You would take more words Now to describe us  Yes or no words at all  Well The waves yonder the wild crabapple trees Bring that time to mind quicker Coarse broad blade grass The cut grass with three sides the wild cheat grass white And all broken with its seed shelled The tracked ground And leaf stems marked my hands and arms the windfalls From the wild crabapple trees a young thorn tree Which I tasted the bark of Taste of salt the sun I could eat the wind then and salt water I wanted no fire For running in the sun warmed me No friend need Ever put a hand on me I was the beauty The young man who is dead could have told you  Then I I remember your face better than your sisters names The tall girl in the wind of that fire  118  H L Davis  And she again Yes If I die here and hang on a fruit tree To scare birds from my orchard you ll go under me Thinking that girl died years ago remember her Thin legs wind in her short hair her shrill voice And go between these trees saying Dead so long As if she had never grown for lack of you Look at me This is my orchard and these are her hands My mouth is the mouth you remember red or not red  Let it be until she have gone but I know this That you can come to this orchard O thin girl I have seen you run here and seen the wind burn your face And burn your young mouth and blow your dress like fire And your spirit passes me when I desire  STALKS OF WILD HAY  I can shake the wild hay and wet seed sticks to my hand The white lower stalks seem solid Yellow flowers Grow in the sun with dog fennel near apple trees White petals carry to this water So plants breed But I the man who would have put up his life Against less pleasure than yours against your black hair And your deep mouth ask that no man my friend Find me in this wild hay now or tonight To remind me how worthless this was which was so dear It is late for me to see grass stalks my first time And for this trouble of spirit to come to an end  119  BAKING BREAD  Red berries are on the bent stalks these turn to the sky That might be a pond of water Geese come all day In long squadrons which make no shadow to the wild grass Silver poplar leaf foxing in the frozen stalks A white blaze in this old garden what poplar grove Was that where the three women worked baking bread Where they began at morning by their fire under the wet  boughs And laid the loaves in the sun  So one of these women came From the bread board and a little into the grass And braided her dark hair again with cold hands One came loaded with dead wood close to the fire And leaned pulling her dress tight at the breast to warm One was laying out loaves two women at the fire I saw between them the leaves start along the wind s lane And heard leaves like spray on the white trees and saw the  stems And low branches which break in winter bend and draw  down Boughs drew between our eyes and the fire eldest daughter That the blaze blew apart like leaves She said Wind  again To chill us and to shake leaf water over our bread This is our third month and what have we to show When the men brag that they have cleared so much ground  120  H L Davis  The bread even tastes bitter of the poplar stems That blow wild look this is spray from the river On my hands and hair the fire is blown out I am tired of cold and wind and wild geese and this field And of trimming fire and hair to suit the wind  And said We ll have a house and pleasure when the  grain s in And when all this has lost me the use of my pride And like river waves heavy across the frozen beach The hair was heavy which her hands lifted and her mouth Had no color and there was spray upon her face By now surely that woman is either old Or dead more likely Yet in pity of her pride The mind stirs uneasy as if she this day Stood by the field s edge braiding her hair and gazed At the fire in wind under wet poplar boughs  TH E RAIN CROW  While women were still talking near this dead friend I came out into a field where evergreen berry vines Grew over an old fence with rain on their leaves And would not have thought of her death except for a few Low sheltered berry leaves I believed the rain Could not reach them but it rained on them every one So when we thought this friend safest and most kind Resetting young plants against winter it was she Must come to be a dead body And to think  121  That she knew so much and not that she would die  Not that most simple thing for her hands or her eyes  Dead There were prints in the soft spaded ground Which her knees made when she dug her tender plants Above the berry leaves the black garden and all the land Steamed with rain like a winded horse appeared strong And the rain crow s voice which we took for a sign of rain Began like a little bell striking in the leaves So I sat in the rain listening to this bird s voice And thought that our friend s mouth now its Dead I am  dead Was like the rain crow sounding during the rain As if rain were a thing none of us had ever seen  THE THRESHING FLOOR  See in a dead vine How many blackbirds are swinging the lives there In vines and in dead leaves that need no help of you Rein your horse into the salai Davis follow down The cleared ground this frosty day to the threshing floor Red is women close together in the broken weeds Watching the horses red dresses and blue Thin cloth of early day dresses spread among the burrs  Yellow is where the threshing floor is and horses hoofs Beat the grain heads into chaff and cold wind  Strews chaff over the bushes and to the eyes  122  H L Davis  Women call to the horse driver and laugh out At the man behind the horses who catches the horse droppings With his hands to keep the grain clean  And crippled old man You shake in this cold wind yet have come out of doors To see your grain threshed again under the sky clearer Than a beach you stand shaking and face the chaff with red  eyes  I fork a horse on the hill above the threshing floor Driver and bundle handlers the ones in red dresses I must lose none of this because men I have known Are less simple or are secret as birds in vines  FROM A VINEYARD  The bushes have borne few berries scarcely a color That hangs against the rocks and dips when the wind Aimed against the low branches bows them to the root Back of this poor river country the grain is housed And blackbirds going to eat a little dropped grain Hurry from the cold beaches What must begin But thoughts of my friends yonder of such a life And of such a man s body One Laura who is my friend Whose throat is round without shadow and the warmth Is like fire upon the eyes Italian woman dark haired Worker in the bearing vines I envy them Who know how your breast shaped who measured you From little to tall woman  123  Riding brings me much Among the dead plants and through the shedding vines These lives I know of the mouths underground Roots mouths that since summer are useless and have died So the wild gourds turn yellow upon their black stems Drop and presently that fruit opens to the seed  Laura Italian over whose vines the blackbirds fly It is longer than this knowledge is old since you came Through the dead and frosty vineyard to my side  THE MARKET GARDENS  This clear day almost of winter the wind runs The white pigeons wild and helpless and I go about Alone in that flood basin of land which families Tend all year Foreign women now harrow it All at work who turn green land under and the furrows Drawn and raked seem little darker than these faces Oh now I pity old flesh that can not warm itself A tail of heavy gray hair whips across the back Of one stooped the oldest woman her thin dress Like wet cloth sticks to back and legs in the wind  These are they who set out wind breaks of the rods Of green willows and now a few are grown branched trees That limber when the wind freshens and spin leaves Among the stiff dead rods Pheasants heavier breasted Than pigeons live about the willows and quail  124  H L Davis  Feed in the dead nettles little birds pick at the grass Or go as if lost about the white dog fennel still The song of blackbirds comes occasionally from the swale  It comes so that I remember one whose love I could not have and grieved for Since her death I have taken to desiring pride of verse instead But see how many birds are not yet gone Though the frost left them no comfort a month ago And the foreign women s patience as if for a spirit Such as my mind sees with heart and eyes and hands Of that woman who is dead and upon her wrists White pigeons bow and delight her This mind s a child Who is whipped and stands silent for a little while  Near his mother wondering if kindness still exist  OCTOBER THE OLD EYES  In these cold mornings the alders can not hold their leaves But in the stained pond water drop them broad and cold Days ago the willows yellowed the river s edge The river breaks are stuck full of gray wild seed Dry and without the late hunger is every weed  The latest bearing tree s fruit is under roof  Nothing we value is left nothing is left  Except the garden Eusebia planted as she grew old Under the trees of her orchard the tall marigolds  125  Past their best are grown dark yellow with rain Half wild stalks that gave this woman much pride and much pain To thin and keep in order  It has rained and turned cold No one comes along the river or the breaks No foot has changed the color of this tall grass About her house big rose hips ripen partly gray Who sits in the leaves there the old eyes and the flesh  fallen Eusebia Owen is come again this chilly day A ghost comes and grieves at last because she is old  The water of dead leaves which the fruit trees Shed upon her dress is not cold there s no fear now though Hard waves in the river gather and pace to the wind There s no pleasure in mangold petals upon her face She grieves and says So many years I let go Working hard and was content to think that love Would surely return but the dead go all alone  It is so the years during which this woman lived Were divided so many for love so many following For work and at last let them be busy with flowers Dusty summers long harvests awhile to rest but in the  cold days Eusebia gathered tree cotton to weave cloth upon Worked with her garden and would not fold her hands This woman was not idle until she died  126  H L Davis  There s tree cotton and cold days another year  In which all her use is departed This sad ghost That cries for love again even the spirit is old The hair which hangs against the dry breast is gray The old dark dress is worn thin and wet and cold  She who wears it would enjoy love again would lie  In childbed over again  When I was her friend I thought she had been content and see the gray hair Heavy and stained with water Once she was vain And now leaves stick upon her dress and her arms Now she has left secrecy and I am ashamed That we were less friends than ever I had dreamed  TO THE RIVER BEACH  Let me go now now that from grown alders leaves Have torn loose and go flying close to the sand Along the black river water White rye grass bends Under the wind under the sky toward water Where the pheasants feed hiding and the few willows With dark alder leaves caught in them join and part I have not seen them for so long I see dark mouths Black with juice of berries and I remember the children Who ran shaking the tall rye grass So they run And scatter as if caught in the wind gathering The last beach fruit late ripening which they can save  H L Davis  127  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SLEEP POEMS  OLD LIZETTE ON SLEEP  Bed is the boon for me It s well to bake and sweep But hear the word of old Lizette It s better than all to sleep  Summer and flowers are gay And morning light and dew But aged eyelids love the dark Where never a light seeps through  What open eyed my dears Thinking your hearts will break There s nothing nothing nothing I say That s worth the lying awake  I learned it in my youth Love I was dreaming of I learned it from the needle work That took the place of love  I learned it from the years And what they brought about From song and from the hills of joy Where sorrow sought me out  It s good to dream and turn  128  Agnes Lee  And turn and dream or fall To comfort with my pack of bones And know of nothing at all  Yes never know at all If prowlers mew or bark  Nor wonder if it s three o clock  Or four o clock of the dark  When the longer shades have fallen And the last weariness Has brought the sweetest gift of life The last forgetfulness  If a sound as of old leaves Stir the last bed I keep Then say my dears It s old Lizette She s turning in her sleep  THE ANCIENT SINGER  The wonder of our century They sing it stave on stave They sing it loud they sing it long New voices voices brave  The ring of it the thrill of it Is over every sea And some are great enough to sing And some have missed the key  129  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But I must be content to stand  Upon an old highway  And sing the sleeping centuries  Whose dreams are towers today  MRS MALOOLY  Mrs Malooly has gone to her rest Who scrubbed Manhattan s marble aisles She has forgotten forgotten forgotten The mop and broom And the patterned tiles  Mrs Malooly has gone to her rest In the smooth dug loam to a rest so deep She has forgotten forgotten forgotten The unmade bed And the whiskey sleep  THE ILEX TREE  What spirit touched the faded lambrequin And slept The doorway s lintel ambered rosed With age overlooks a stunted ilex tree Grown in the middle path Its branches guard The house in silence or with green dark gesture Spreading protection whisper pleadingly The past is asleep behind the lambrequin Do not go in The door is closed  Agnes Lee  130  THREE POEMS  CYTHAERA AND THE LEAVES  Ancient terrible tree You drink the light of leaves And shed the leaves relentlessly  My heart is April green And its belief Is in sunlight not in trees Or secret roots it has not seen My heart is light as a leaf Let it go dancing down the breeze  Withered and beaten sodden drowned It shall see faithful leaves turn red and gold And cling and hold Until despite their gold and red They flutter to the ground  Shall leaves remember flying When they are dead  CYTHAERA AND THE SONG  The narrow door Is open to the starlight Let us go Beloved toward the night  131  We venture into darkness when we speak It is like wind blowing through withered grass While from our hearts no word Disturbs the silence where we pass  And though our fingers sparkle when they touch Like fireflies our fingers still are young Our spirits have forgotten much Night is a song in a forgotten tongue  We try to fling  Our lives into the night our bodies sway  We gesture bravely with our hands  Our spirits cling  To the safe nothingness of yesterday  And so at last unshattered as before  Laughing breathless desperate we return  To the narrow door  CYTHAERA AND THE WORM  Silence  Spun from what you never said  Is but a winding sheet  In which a worm lies dead  The worm of love  A spinning its cocoon  Of silken cloth  132  Marjorie Allen Seiffert  Of delicate silence whence so soon It should emerge a lunar moth  O worm So royally interred Why should I dream pale wings about my head  Marjorie Allen Seiffert  TRANSITION  There is a little room in my heart Where we used to live together A very cozy little room  You walked out carelessly Leaving the door half open But I closed and locked it crying  Sometimes when I pass the door I wish you would come back Throw wide the seaward windows Kindle the fire again Although I know we are both better Out here in the changing crowded world For after all it is a very little room  Eleanor Hammond  133  SURRENDER  Love me child of the morning Happy blossom in the wind love me See I am sad I have dwelt long in chaos And my hands and my feet are star pierced Love me  Love me I have won through a thousand glooms to your heart I have stifled in the dark of Nothingness I have wrestled with suns and moons Now love me with laughter staunch my wounds   Road stained harsh and weary hungered of joy Once I climbed to the end But there was no end there was Night Kiss me blind me with the hot mercy of your lips God is Night only Night  I will never journey I will forsake the flinty roads of the eternal I will rest here in your kindness I will forsake the sun and moon and stars And live here in your laughter  Irwin Granich  134  OUT OF THE DARK  What is death to me now Now my beloved is gone A silence that cries aloud An emptiness filled with dreams An end that is but a beginning  What is the world to me now Now my beloved is gone Noise without meaning Crowds without thought Life that has lost its vitality And lives without love  Let them sink their great ships Let them fight their dark battles Bring disaster and suffering and woe What does it mean to me now Now my beloved is gone  A N Paris February 1917  135  SONGS  I  I saw a grown girl coming down The field with water for the men Her hair fell golden in the wind She stopped and bound it up again  Her thin dress by the wind was pressed Was it in passion or in play Against the full growth of her breast  The men looked up She looked away  II  You saw me staring at the girl And then you stared at me Why did you come so close and kiss My lips so passionately I would not have you quite so young Or quite so shy as she  III  A gypsy passed me with a song Where men went out to sow  136  Glenn Ward Dresbach  And he went down the winding road Where the maples grow  And still his song came back to me When he was far away The Flask holds but a pint of wine Tomorrow is Today  My love has made a tent for me From stars above the hill Go break your heart and build yourself A stone house if you will  IV  I would build myself a house On this mountain top today  Not to shun the world or feel It was shutting me away But that I might come at times  Little things had baffled me And look out at set of sun On immensity  Glenn Ward Dresbach  137  THE RIDDLE  Is Mary Garden or Nazimova The greater actress Pardon me both they And you and I seem dreams to me today   All shapes all forms seem utterly Vague images of sleep to me And my real self moves all alone Between huge pyramids of stone To where a crouching figure lies With furtive cruel half closed eyes And with that crouched thing I hold Converse a hundred centuries old She asks I answer And not one Of all her riddles do I shun I look into her half closed eyes And menace her with my replies I am alone She is alone And round us pyramids of stone She asks are good and ill the same She asks has Nature any aim She asks is God a ghost or flame And I I answer and the sun Sinks and a thousand years are one One year one night   Is Mary Garden or Nazimova  138  John Cowper Powys  The greater actress Pardon me both they And you and I seem dreams to me today  John Cowper Powys  THE SHEPHERD HYMN  My sheep hear my pipe call To fine grass sweet with dew I lead them  The morn hour They are refreshed and strengthened and fed Trees thick with leaves afford them cool shade  My sheep hear my pipe call To brown depths of the stream I lead them  The noon hour On bright ripples their warm mouths are fed The low wind disturbs not their quiet shade  My sheep hear my Christ call Through rough world work to life I lead them  Till eve hour Of spirit immortal they are fed My great wing spreads over them calm shade  Gladys Hensel  139  COLD HILLS  AUSTERITY  I have lived so long On the cold hills alone I loved the rock And the lean pine trees Hated the life in the turfy meadow Hated the heavy sensuous bees I have lived so long Under the high monotony of starry skies I am so cased about With the clean wind and the cold nights People will not let me in To their warm gardens Full of bees  THE END OF THE AGE  With wash and ripple and with wave Slow moving up the long deserted sand The little moon went watching the white tide Flood in and over spread above the land Flood the low marshes make a silver cover Where the green sea weed in a floating mist Creeps under branch and over The wide water spreads the night goes up the The era ends  140  Janet Loxley Lewis  Tomorrow comes warm blood with a new race Warm hearts that ache for lovers and for friends And the pitiful grace Of young defeated heads Tomorrow comes the sun color and flush And anguish Now let the water wash Out of the evening sky the lingering reds And spread its coolness higher than the heart Of every silver bush  Night circles round the sky The era ends  GEOLOGY  Look said God And with slow fingers  Drew away the mantle rock  Man followed groping  To touch the flesh of his true mother  And standing in great valleys  He saw the ages passing  FOSSIL  I found a little ancient fern  Closed in a reddish shale concretion  As neatly and as charmingly shut in  As my grandmother s face in a daguerreotype  In a round apricot velvet case  Janet Loxley Lewis  141  FROM THE FRAIL SEA  Suggested by a Hawaiian legend  Only Ka ne could do this After the other gods failed Ka ne the careless creator Who looked on Indolently While his industrious brothers fretting over little tasks Wedged bones for the wings of birds And carved mortals of coral  Impatiently they looked up From their litters of shells and feathers When Ka ne With the crash of fresh thunder Pro created fire  They knew he had made the sun When they thought he was harmlessly playing Under the iridescence of stars They had shielded their heads with their arms When he wrung With a great laugh Day from the centre knot of night  Now in a moment of passion Ka ne brooding and lusty  142  Genevieve Taggard  Pro created fire In the dim womb of water  Green and amber flooded The sea lay serene Warm to the brim of the tide Her full soft bosom blossoming In vanishing flowers On the sands  Foam fronds Too frail To uncurl their hidden yellow stamens on the sands  Frail A quiet cupful of water Untouched by the tangles of reefs And untorn by the violences of surfs With no knowledge of iron islands or the cold harsh hands  of storms  Serene and frail  From the gold honey of her long undulations  To the milky tendrils  That curled and coiled and clung  Against the sands  So brooding Ka ne leaned down  143  And took the sea And drew it shimmering into a single wave Until it touched heaven And him  Then sobbing The sea slipped back And spread and became still  A slow wavering Went like a light From end to end of the sea  The sea not the sky Was about to bear fire And the light of a drowned sun Pushed up ridges of crystal  Terrible gauzes of foam Broke to its surfaces And the slant of great shadows blotted its round tides  Then in agony The sea screamed And fire her enemy Tore her with a long sound of rending Like a silk garment Fire jumped from the wet sea  144  Genevieve Taggard  Nimble Youngest of the elements  For like horses had reared up Eight slim necked volcanoes Horses stamping underneath And tossing manes of fire to the sun  Then did the sea begin to learn After bearing Ka ne These eight sons these eight frightful volcanoes How to make surf like whips How to beat after the manner of mothers How to build reefs for the safety of her sons And how when they threw hot stones at her who bore them To fling the foam of madness at their feet  Genevieve Taggard  145  COMMENT  MEN OR WOMEN  S poetry a masculine rather than a feminine art Is it loved and practiced more by men than women The question has often been asked but certain incidents move us to ask it again History of course gives an affirmative answer in spite of the lyric supremacy of Sappho men have been an immense majority in the creation of poetry and apparently also in its appreciation And even today when women are becoming constantly more expressive in this art as in others the same answer would seem to apply  Our attention was called to the subject by an enemy friend on the Philadelphia Record who in a recent editorial entitled Mutterings of a Sex War an article devoted chiefly to a quarrel between experts in psychology introduced the following paragraph by way of corollary  There is evidence in Dr Hickson s own town that the predominance of feminist influence has had a bad effect upon one factor in the world s progress whose importance has never been fully appreciated by the plain people The vigorous male note is now seldom heard in the land and almost never at all in the pages of POETRY A MAGAZINE OF VERSE the most pretentious publication in the country devoted solely to that important branch of letters POETRY is edited by a woman its policy is largely dominated by another woman with radical and perverse notions of the high art of singing and most of its contributors are feminine by accident of birth while the majority of the male minority are but thin tenors  To this assault the editor of POETRY replied as follows  146  Men or Women  after quoting the above paragraph in the Record s Sunday  issue of April nth  Before indulging in self reproach I was led to look up the facts I find that during the past year April 1919 to March 1920 inclusive POETRY has printed verse from 105 contributors of whom 64 were men and 41 were women Counting the pages of these twelve numbers I am astonished to discover that of 373 devoted to verse 247 were filled by men and 126 by women the proportion being almost exactly two to one  Among the 64 male poets liberally represented are such sissies as Edgar Lee Masters Carl Sandburg Vachel Lindsay William Butler Yeats D H Lawrence Edwin Ford Piper Lew Sarett and Wallace Stevens most of whom even aside from their poetry are doing a man s work in the world of affairs If you are ignorant of their records perhaps Who s Who will enlighten you And among our younger contributors I might mention a number of soldiers straight from the A E F  The facts compel me to accuse myself of injustice toward my own sex If you still grieve that POETRY is edited by a woman perhaps you will be kind enough to list those major poets of the nobler sex whom we are neglecting Both I and my associate who during half the past year has been a man will be grateful for the information  The controversy is amusing but perhaps also enlighten  ing The editor had suspected masculine preponderance in  the magazine but by no means to such a degree as the fig  ures prove They confirm her impression that more men  than women find in this art for better or worse for joy  or sorrow their friend and confidant It is certain that  more men than women come to the POETRY office with  good bad or indifferent verse in their pockets for sale or  appraisement come with carefully concealed emotion which  occasionally drops its disguise of humor or nonchalance  and breaks into smiles or even tears  147  Of the three thousand or so real or alleged poems which reach us by mail each month men and women are about equally guilty says the associate editor who does the first reading adding with conviction But more rotten verse comes from women than from men  Thus so far as POETRY S statistics can prove anything  the modern man would seem to be holding his precedence  in this art and the modern woman has yet to prove her  equality as a creative artist POETRY receives more pub  lishable verse and less hopelessly bad verse from the vig  orous male than from the aspiring female  There is perhaps in women s verse today less aping of  the vigorous male note than formerly a franker expres  sion of truly feminine emotion Women poets of our time  usually seem content to be women They recognize that  masculine art through all past ages has held the eye and  ear of the world and that the feminine note is quite as  authentic and should be in its own way quite as vigorous  and beautiful as the masculine Perhaps women are just  beginning their work in the arts and this twentieth century  may witness an extraordinary development H M  DISCOVERED IN PARIS  American poetry of the present day has become the subject of controversy in Paris It is all due to the young French poet and critic Jean Catel who last summer took a Master s degree at the University of Minnesota with a  148  Discovered in Paris  thesis on the subject entitled The American Image as related in our March number Returning to Paris full of enthusiasm he published in Les Marges of mid January an article on present day American poetry which stirred up the wrath of Vincent O Sullivan who had consistently neglected that subject in the Mercure de France In a recent number of Les Marges March 15th appears Mr O Sul livan s letter of protest and his young antagonist s categorical and most ironical answer which withers up Mr O S root branch blossom and all  Better yet Mr Catel has broken into the Mercure of March 15th with an article perhaps the first of a series Sur la poésie Américaine d aujourd hui After a brief introduction we have a twenty five page appreciation of Robert Frost and Carl Sandburg who in the writer s opinion sing the American epic  W e translate a few sentences and the final paragraphs  Robert Frost makes one think of Vergil No cries no explosions a sympathy which doubles the value of the verse as a fine fabric that of a garment One feels that he is suspicious of his heart as a protestant is of mysticism But we are not deceived this puritan poet is full of tenderness His is the solitude of the puritan who does not discuss God and first principles certainties which he respects because that which comes from the soul or from true things is sacred This respect has bridled his imagination he thinks like Pascal that she is a mistress of error  Robert Frost is a great artist  Sandburg s first book opens upon the formidable silhouette of Chicago serene as the Sphynx indifferent as God to the pygmies who sing or weep at her feet But who would curse God and Sandburg is a believer His indestructible faith goes to meet this force this youth of the world which the city represents   Chicago is at the same time veiled with smoke and dust and  149  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  swept by the lake wind Carl Sandburg has no other basis and background than this soil where men have planted their dwellings and this sea crossed by ships and sea gulls This is his interior landscape it captures his rhythm Rhythm large and massive sometimes as a steel mill again brief and delicate as a rosebush in a park  A stern sincerity is revealed in these poems A long cry of love and hope resounds across his pages The ferocity of modern civilization is there but also the pride of a man who lives among men among those who suffer and struggle and die   Prairie the magnificent symphony which opens Cornhuskers expresses above all the poet s idealism But it is more than that it is a cosmic vision The beginnings of the world are always the most beautiful poetry that exists The Egyptians have their Pyramids The Greeks have their cyclopean walls and vases of gold The Americans have their Prairie Sung by Sandburg this Prairie becomes the impassive Force which has created the American people   Cornhuskers offers us an interpretation in new terms and rhythms of reality Sandburg has an indigenous vocabulary that is to say words and arrangements of words charged with immediate associations He loves the brutal term He chooses the word which bites or that which burns His phrase is a sword or a bullet His verse is a spark or a torch   Spontaneously almost without knowing it these two poets and others of whom we must speak tell us the beauty of new things new souls   Frost is the poet of pioneers who rest from their labors Sandburg of pioneers who follow their task The first is the past which persists with all its melancholy and faded charm The second is the present which affirms its hopes and certainties  One should complete Frost by Sandburg and Sandburg by Frost  Let us be on our guard against sure and hasty judgment of the American spirit and poetry With a little good will we shall understand better that which politics the War personal irritations between soldiers and others have concealed from indifferent eyes and egotistic hearts And because we feel in this great people an idealism which seeks a road to the light we have given them all our confidence and much of our love  Such work as Mr Catel s is a re assertion of that singular  but intimate spiritual kinship between his compact nation  150  Discovered in Paris  and our own so much more extended and varied a kinship which may be obscured more or less in ordinary piping times of peace but flames into a torch of power in times of crisis H M  REVIEWS  STARVED ROCK  Starved Rock by Edgar Lee Masters Macmillan Co  Perhaps the most unfortunate thing that can happen to a poet is to have his first book a great popular success for he can neither write the same book again nor contrive to please his public by any departure from it Spoon River Anthology has been just such a stumbling block to its author for while it served as a stepping stone to fame it has to a certain extent interfered with the success of his later poetry Spoon River is a sort of note book into which Mr Masters condensed his observations of people a case filled with human specimens It was read by the general public as an intimate chronicle of human lives and passions with all the realism of whispered gossip They were deaf to the poetry and philosophy in it  Now as an impassioned scientist Mr Masters synthesizes his material draws deductions infers laws traces the course of human destiny in the abstract His poems are longer many of them are overweighted with philosophy Spoon River is a series of direct compact pictures of people In his later books Mr Masters resigns this condensation which  151  is essentially poetic in favor of an explicitness a wealth of detail comment and analysis essentially philosophical He leaves us less and less to the intuitions of our emotional reactions preferring not to trust his readers to do any of the work  Starved Rock is composed of unrelated poems which cohere because of the purpose underlying nearly all of them the Will to Know It is not because of their beauty that they will live though some of the poems in the book are very beautiful but because of the fierce intensity of this purpose and since Edgar Lee Masters passionate realist that he is can find no unequivocal answer in the material world to the questions which perplex his spirit there is tragedy in the tone of the book  The title poem Starved Rock tells of this generation letting down its bucket for the water of life  And thirsting spurred by hope  Kneel upon aching knees  And with our eager hands draw up the bucketless rope  This is not the hopeful song of those poets who go Pol lyannering through life and even Mr Masters allows himself a greater optimism in certain other poems In Winged Victory for instance he foresees the eventual freeing of the human spirit by a generation able to mingle the Oriental Egyptian Greek and Christian philosophies and thus add  the final glory of wings to the soul of man In an order of life human but divine Fashioned in carefulest thought powerful and of delicate design  152  Starved Rock  He profoundly distrusts the Hebrew system of religion as the spiritual standard for this country and his bitter protest against the narrow bigotry of Sabbatarians is heard again and again His ideal theology would embrace the best of the great religions of the world ancient and modern In a very beautiful Easter poem called The World s Desire he tells of the yearning of humanity for some hope of immortality symbolized in temple rites from the time of the Pharaohs and found in every religion to be consummated at the coming of Christ  For at Bethlehem the groaning world s desire For spring that burned from Egypt up to Tyre And from Tyre to Athens beheld an epiphany of fire The flesh fade flower like while the soul kept breath Beyond the body s death Even as nature which revives In consummation of the faith That Tammuz the soul survives And is not sacrificed  Yet it seems that this poet accepts Christ and his doctrine as an anodyne for a suffering world not as his own creed In Epitaph for Us he seems to speak more authentically  But what was love and what was lust Memory passion pain and trust Returned to clay and blown in dust Is nature without memory  As passionless as stars bestow Your glances on the world below As a man looks at hand or knee What is the turf of you what the tree Earth is a phantom let it be  153  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The same idea that we merge with earth and lose our personal consciousness is expressed again in I shall Go Down into This Land  To turn from the theological aspect of the book to another side of its philosophy one finds Tyrannosaurus or Burning Letters one of the most brilliant poems of the collection Typically Mastersesque in style it seeks with a half bitter half whimsical resignation to find a reason for the rapture and pain and final futility of human love ending with the tentative suggestion that love may be the chlorophyll which makes our human souls eatable sweet and crisp for the unseen gods and therefore of some use in the scheme of things It is always characteristic of this poet to seek some interpretation of present emotion present suffering through its relation to the universe at large Bon nybell the Butterfly belongs in the same category  Beside this cosmic philosophy there are a number of analytical poems in a style which Mr Masters last two books The Great Valley and Toward the Gulf have already made familiar to us Best of them for its biting satire is The Christian Statesman betraying the author s violent political partisanship and his above mentioned revolt against the bigotry which seeks to curb personal liberty see also O You Sabbatarians and Pallas Athene for sympathetic insight his beautiful portrait of Roosevelt At Sagamore Hill To this group belong also the interpretations of Poe and Byron in Washington Hospital and Lord Byron to Dr Polidori In the former poem Poe says  154  Starved Rock  And there are souls born lonely I am one And gifted with the glance of looking through The shams and opera bouffe and I am one I used to walk to High Bridge sit and muse Upon this monstrous world and why it is And why the souls that love the beautiful And love it only and are doomed to speak Its wonder and its terror are alone   Later And what is life beside Whether with drink or whether with abstinence Except to sing your song and die  There are a dozen lyrics in the book which seem almost out of place among so many narrative and philosophical poems Though they are a by product of Mr Masters spirit as sheer poetry they outrank most of his work and it is upon the beauty of such lyrics that one bases the assertion that he is essentially a poet not primarily a philosopher writing in verse It is difficult to choose among these lyrics By the Waters of Babylon To Robert Nichols Epitaph for Us Sounds out of Sorrow Neither Faith nor Beauty can Remain are all beautiful but it is impossible to quote them all Perhaps the first and last stanzas of The House on the Hill best represent this group  Eagle your broken wings are tangled Among the mountain ferns On a ledge of rock on high Below a yawning chasm turns To blackness but the evening planet burns Above the gulf in a gold and purple sky  The world s wanderer finds you As he climbs the mountains In the unending quest Can you spread wings across the darkening chasm  155  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  To the craggy nest Where the foreboding mate lies still Croak for the evening star And beat your shattered wings against your breast Across the gulf the wanderer sees afar A light in the house on the hill I  Starved Rock is a sombre book It expresses the sufferings the fearless revolt of a great soul not only against the limitations which human beings try to impose upon each other but also against those greater limitations which have been placed between our spirits and a clear understanding of the universe God It is the expression of a profoundly religious soul a keenly analytical mind in an eager passionate human being Mr Masters is not willing to take anything on faith and yet there is a proud high hearted optimism an optimism stripped bare of tinsel and furbelows expressed in The Folding Mirror The wings of the mirror are conceived as time and space between which the soul of man cowers in terror To comfort himself man has created a spiritual and a temporal reality The poem ends  God in the blackness whirlwind lightning God in the blinding fire of the sun Before these empty mirrors brightening See what we do what we have done Out of an astral substance molding Music and laws for our hearts control Yes and a hope that the mirrors folding Lets slip through a growing soul  Yours and ours the consolations In loneliness and terror wrought Out of our spirits desolations Out of our spirits love and thought  M A Seiffert  156  Perilous Leaping  PERILOUS LEAPING  Poems by T S Eliot Alfred A Knopf  Mr Eliot evidently believes that a view from a mountain cannot be appreciated unless the ascent is a perilous leaping from crag to crag At least the first pages of his latest book an American reprint with a few additions of Prufrock and Other Observations published in 1917 by the London Egoist are filled with intellectual curios curios that form a prodigious array of hazards leading up to the big poems Lovers of exercise will find their minds flexed if not inert after following the allusions and ellipses of Gerontian It is as though in this initial poem Mr Eliot went through his morning calisthenics saying This my good people is a small part of what I do to give you a poem or more accurately perhaps Come work with me show you deserve true beauty And with a Whoop la for he is in beautiful condition he swings from romance to realism to religion to history to philosophy to science while you and I climb pantingly wearily after him clinging to a few familiar words and looking from time to time at sign posts along the way to reassure ourselves of the fact that this does lead us to true beauty  The poems guaranteed to produce white blood corpusclesin any brain come before page 37 a specific hint for the faint hearted Fortified by a dictionary an encyclopedia an imagination and a martyr s spirit even these may be enjoyed They are certainly remarkable for their mystifying titles their coy complexities of content and their line  157  consuming words What for instance could be more naive than the introduction to Sweeney in Sweeney Erect  Paint me a cavernous waste shore Cast in the unstilled Cyclades Paint me the bold anfractuous rocks Faced by the snarled and yelping seas Display me Aeolus above Reviewing the insurgent gales Which tangle Ariadne s hair And swell with haste the perjured sails  Morning stirs the feet and hands Nausicaa and Polypheme Gesture of orang outang Rises from the sheets in steam  Sweeney addressed full length to shave  However in among these stepping stones to the poems that are worth a great deal of trouble to get though one resents being reminded of the fact by Mr Eliot himself are one or two resting places such as the whimsical pathos of A Cooking Egg the gentle crudity of Sweeney Among the Nightingales and the sophisticated humor of The Hippopotamus And I must further acknowledge that Mr Eliot s humor is the cultivated progeny of a teasing spirit of fun and a keen audacity the mixture of the Zoo and the True Church in The Hippopotamus will tickle the palate of the most blasé epicurean  And now feeling that the ascent has been long and hard we reach the summit and are repaid by reading The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock and Portrait of a Lady These two poems are so far superior to the gymnastics that pre  158  Perilous Leaping  cede and to the interesting versatilities that follow them that they must be classed alone  Prufrock which was first published by POETRY in 1915 is a psychological study of that rather piteous figure the faded philandering middle aged cosmopolite a scrupulous psychological study for the pervasive beauty of the imagery the rhythms used and the nice repetitions all emphasize the sympathetic accuracy of the context For instance the three lines  I grow old I grow I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled  Shall I part my hair behind Do I dare to eat a peach  In Portrait of a Lady we find a like startling acuteness for details with a dramatic ending which is a fitting example for the definition L art est un étonnement heureux  And possibly possibly it is wise to work up to J Alfred Prufrock and Portrait of a Lady and to slide pleasantly down again on the humor and ironies of the poems following for we might become dizzy if we found ourselves on a mountain without the customary foundations  Marion Strobel  OUT OF THE DEN  Picture show by Siegfried Sassoon E P Dutton and Co  There is a famous passage in Plato s Republic wherein he compares the world of sight to a prison in which men are enchained while above and behind them blazes the light  159  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of a fire which is the world of spiritual realities And between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way and you will see if you look a low wall built along the way like the screen which marionette players have before them over which they show the puppets  but the prisoners see only their own shadows or the shadows of one another which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave  It is the cave of Plato s imagining rather than the exaggerations of the cinema that Sassoon s Picture show recalls to the memory He is like one who has been liberated from the cave of our worldly illusions who has suffered sharp pains from being compelled suddenly to go up and turn his neck round and walk and look at the light yet who remembering his old habitation and the wisdom of the den and his fellow prisoners would rather suffer anything than live after their manner The allegory goes further than this for Sassoon is one who has returned to the cave and who walks ill in that unaccustomed darkness Truly men say of him that Up he went and down he comes without his eyes  and if any one tried to loose another and lead him up to the light let them only catch the offender in the act and they would put him to death  In Counter attack one felt the poet s scornful pity for his fellow prisoners In Picture show one feels rather his awareness of the great light from which he has come The reiterant Have you forgotten yet of such a poem as Aftermath is fierce and hot but there is less bitterness in  160  Out of the Den  it than an intense will to keep the faith with his vision Here as in so many poems in this fresh volume his anger is much less than his compassion The earlier book seemed the work of a man who was struggling with an emotion too big for him perhaps too big for any one man to speak out Here the poet s recognition of this expressed in Limitations and again in the Prelude to a Masterpiece seems to clarify his utterance  There is something curiously reminiscent of Rupert Brooke in these poems Curious because Brooke s reaction to the war at least as evidenced in the famous sonnets of 1914 was so utterly different One cannot help wondering whether if Brooke had lived he might not have written in the mood of Sassoon For after all the things that move Sassoon are those familiar and lovely things that were celebrated so perfectly in The Great Lover One feels it in such lines as these The hollow cry of hounds like lonely bells or the grey blue twilight where Shoals of low jargoning men drift inward to the sound Drawn by a lamp as well as in that sensitive satire which watches the moon rise over an archaeological dispute and  as her whitening way aloft she took I thought she had a pre dynastic look  The difference is that Sassoon hears music and savors beauty with the intensity and acuteness of one who has walked amid the fires and for whom all ordinary things are henceforth touched with the wounding light of his superior reality If he adores Winds birds and glittering leaves that flare  161  and fall he is as keenly aware of corpses rotting in front of a front line trench and he watches where  the troopship in a thrill Of fiery chambered anguish throbs and rolls  There is more music in this latest book more arresting and radiant imagery But beyond that there is a mellower spirit in it drawing its power from the sheer sharpness of the poet s vision and the heat of his bitter passion  Babette Deutsch  BLACK AND CRIMSON  Black Branches by Orrick Johns Pagan Publishing Co  Aspiring youth is so consistently barking his intellectual knees upon subtlety or realism that one is somewhat skeptical upon opening Mr Johns latest book Black Branches at finding Three Plays in Chiaroscuro Plays in chiaroscuro particularly after the crystalline beauty of the dedication sound as intangible as dreams within dreams Yet the first speech in Shadow the most completely achieved of the three plays is convincingly reassuring  My hands I have folded and refolded  For forty years  My heart sings  Because it has no gestures  Such sepia tinted evasions continue to clarify the tragedy of the theme There is no relief of shouting or of tears for the phrases are heart broken whispers re echoing in their own tense quietude The vivid result is seen in the lines  162  Black and Crimson  The treasures of denial survive Like empty chalices in alluvia  A negation made her The companion of my humility Death centers the divergent shadows In a spot of light  That Mr Johns has by the use of a sustained indirect method etched rather than clouded his effect is noteworthy  Th e remainder of the book is devoted to poems which as a whole give a startling piebald appearance as they are divided into groups of contrasting degrees of merit  Songs of Deliverance is a shout of youth youth writing of youth with bombastic simplicity The lines swagger with assurance and each word does a goose step in the flaunting arrogance of the sentences It is ego triumphant provoking all the egos of all the readers to defend themselves  The faultlessly named Tunings would better have been left on the cuff or wherever Mr Johns keeps his notations and the New Songs of Deliverance are no less innocuous easy to read and to forget this kind of bric à brac  In direct contrast is Kysen sensuous beauty done to the baking point the beauty of tube roses and the tropics painting of the tiger lily producing a heady sustained reaction For instance  Father of Smiles Forgiver I have read in a crimson doe skin book with silver sprays and an orange enamel clasp of a bird in Afric which the Tunisians call buhabibi meaning the bird of laughter and which eats grain from the tongue without being trained  Unfortunately the book does not end here but like some  163  precocious neophyte in the art of sophistication Mr Johns must show off his knowledge of the wicked world Or more specifically he must show T S Eliot that he too can weave a Rabelaisian fancy Unhappily however his delving into obscenity lacks both spontaneity and naturalness The poems are imitative of Eliot not only in context but in the use of the quatrain they have not even the justification of originality And sublimated limericks are particularly deplorable from an author who in a previous volume Asphalt used the lyric form beautifully Perhaps lyrics would not have fitted under the title Black Branches perhaps Mr Johns wished to show his ability in plays vers libre prose poems and he has proved his versatility But one fears that his chasing of stars may loosen his grip on the moon Marion Strobel  STANDARDS OF LITERATURE  De Stéphane Mallarmé au prophète Ezéchiel et essai d une  théorie de réalisme symbolique par Edouard Dujardin  Mercure de France Paris  M Edouard Dujardin is one of the first generation of Symbolistes a short account of his earlier work will be found in Remy de Gourmont s Livre des Masques Vol II  M Dujardin was the founder of La Revue Wagnérienne 1885 which created an appreciation for Wagner in France from 1886 to 1888 the same poet brilliantly edited La Revue Indépendante seule revue d art pendant deux  164  Standards of Literature  uns says Remy de Gourmont After publishing books of poetry poems in prose and a novel Les Lauriers sont coupés M Dujardin became interested in Semitic literature He started from a chance remark of Schopenhauer to investigate Christianity and from Christianity he was led into a profound study of oriental literature which has occupied his energies for many years When he became a savant however the poet in him was not dead but dormant As he read the literature of the Jews in a spirit of disinterested scientific inquiry he found himself more and more obsessed by the poetry of what he was reading This brought him to a consideration of the problems of modern poetry especially in relation to the influence of Stéphane Mallarmé the master of M Dujardin as of all the best poets of that generation This book is the result of his meditations on poetry  These antecedents make M Dujardin s opinion of value it cannot be lightly put aside either as the ravings of a dotard or the extravagances of a young fool It would indeed be surprising if London sunk in a torpid acquiescence in Georgian puerilities should realize the importance of this subtle and thoughtful essay Perhaps America will read and profit by M Dujardin s wisdom though many of the things he has to say are precisely those which the Imagists have been saying for years His réalisme symbolique is simply Imagism the poet he desiderates is H D  This book is concise M Dujardin has compressed his statements so closely that only a reading of his book will  165  prove the justice of my contentions His theory cannot be  crushed into a short review I shall therefore content my  self with giving a few translated extracts  Art is obviously not an enterprise for after dinner entertainments Art is not the juggling of virtuosi or a little amusement of dilettanti On the other hand I do not think that the object of art is to defend ideas however correct justes to preach a moral to teach truths the teaching of morality the propagation of truths need other disciples The essential function of art seems rather to be first of all to liberate men from the servitude of selfish interests then to bring them to a social conception that is to say to a superior conception of the world  I pass over an eloquent exposition of Mallarmé s contribution to poetry one more of influence than of achievement and a closely reasoned defence of Symbolism It is worth noting that among modern poets M Dujardin cites Mallarmé Baudelaire Rimbaud Verlaine Laforgue Walt Whitman with reservations Fort Romains Vildrac Arcos Jouve André Spire the best of the new poets and Claudel His analysis of the defects of the seventeenth century poets Boileau and Racine is clear logical and uncomplimentary  He continues  An artist s first problem is sincerity To be sincere does not mean to tell others the truth or what a man thinks is the truth it means at least in art to tell oneself the truth What is a real writer let us say what is a writer He who employs the tool which is his language to express a thing he has thought The same is said of a painter and of a musician that he is in every meaning of the word a painter or a musician when he expresses by colors or by sounds the vision he has seen the emotion he has felt On the other hand the bad writer the bad painter the bad musician is he who uses his tool to express things which he imagines perhaps that he has thought seen or felt but which in  166  Standards of Literature  reality he has neither thought seen nor felt he is the man who is not sincere  That looks like nothing to express what a man has felt All artists believe they say what they think in reality they only repeat and re arrange what others have thought before them Result an approximate insufficient factitious and generally false expression  A man only thinks well the things he thinks for himself he only expresses well the things he has thought well Every thought not personally thought is an approximate thought every emotion not personally felt remains an approximate emotion every vision which our eye has not seen is an approximate vision That produces approximate literature  Practically there is only one way to write well that is to think personally there is no way to think personally except to think really Reciprocally there is but one way to think one s thought really and that is to seek for its precise expression  Form and matter are vain words there is only style  Style is the concord of thought and expression  Pas de clichés That means nothing but thoughts thought emotions felt visions seen even if the genius be tiny the talent humble there is art  Supreme rule use words according to their real meaning Words are forces and by means of these forces the writer expresses his thoughts his words have a value and it is this value which gives thought the power of expression Among writers only a small minority use the words according to their meaning almost everything we read is an almost à peu près in nearly everything we read words have lost their power their value because they are not used according to their meaning  M Dujardin then analyzes metaphor He takes the  cliché a torrent of tears and shows its falsity It is not  an image An image is the evocation of a concrete thing  Do not confuse the image with the metaphor When a man writes to day She shed a torrent of tears is he sincere does he have at the moment when he writes the phrase a vision of a mountain of its woody or desolate landscapes its high peaks and does he see through the broken rocks this torrent falling bounding in a clamor of sound and foam and in the presence of this alpine hallucination does he exclaim in the depths of his  167  artist s soul This yes this is the flow of tears I see coming from those eyes If he does he is sincere he is a writer  Or is the metaphor he uses a vision not seen a sensation not felt a thought not thought Is it a dead metaphor he has given us  Conclusion The writer is the man who does not use dead metaphors Young men beware of the metaphor The dead metaphor is a simple and certain criterion whereby one  may be recognized When you want to know if a writer is really a writer examine his metaphors The worst clichés are metaphors  I add a few detached sentences  The Greek and Latin classics they are the men who wrote they are the models The worst writers journalists professors academicians Do not be jealous young poets sincerity is left to you  Precision the sincere writer says exactly what he means Profundity he must descend into himself to acquire that perfect consciousness which is true sincerity Concision he will eliminate everything useless and vain to preserve this profound sincerity  I should like to quote more I will add only this If poets would ruthlessly apply to their own work the standards of M Dujardin and refuse to accept any less exacting then the output of poetry would be pleasantly reduced in bulk but significantly improved in quality  Richard Aldington  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  NEW ENGLISH MAGAZINES  It is encouraging to note the after the War activity of English poets as manifested not only in their new books but  168  New English Magazines  also in a number of special magazines devoted wholly or partly to the art Mr Aldington in his London Letter last January mentioned four of these quarterlies and monthlies of the former Art and Letters and Coterie of the latter The Chap book and Voices Another monthly is The London Mercury which began last November under the editorship of J C Squire assisted by Edward Shanks a general literary review which devotes about half its six score pages to current comment and notices and the other half to original contributions in prose and verse Besides these of course the old Poetry Review goes on the journal of the Poetry Society as persistent as it is misrepresentative of whatever is vital in the art in England  All the new English magazines have a distinguished format this without seeing Voices which has not yet reached us They are printed in larger type on better paper than most of us can afford over here and their size ranges from the 61 2 x 8 1 4 inch page of The Chap book to the 71 2 x 10inch page of Coterie None of them has a two column page as in our magazines of similar size and in all the spacing is generous It is a pleasure to handle them and the pictures when they have any are well printed  Of the four under inspection Coterie is the most specialized toward the art we are interested in in spite of futuristic title pages and a few other not very exciting drawings One English reviewer has called it a kind of little Yellow Book a remark which sent me back to that volcanic quarterly of the nineties No we haven t Aubrey Beardsley to  169  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  day a genius who makes these little futurists scatter like withered leaves in a gale and it must be confessed no poem in any of these magazines could hold up its head for the laurel beside John Davidson s Ballad of a Nun Yet Coterie has personality it is not stodgy and it is on the move It is edited by Chaman Lall and among its thirty or more poets are ten of our familiar contributors the English imagists for example and four Americans Eliot Fletcher Conrad Aiken Babette Deutsch And among the poets less familiar are a number of young men and women of promise For example  Who could resist Herbert Read s very modern ballad Huskisson Sacred and Profane Of course there is a suggestion of Eliot in its sardonic whimsicality but it is more barbaric it gets further than Eliot from civilization a wild wind blowing through the little patterned English fields  Sacheverell Sitwell a mere boy in his teens they say also has a light step and an engaging sense of humor as is shown in Week ends Of the three Sitwells this youngest one seems the most original and spontaneous Edith s nursery rhyme naivete is less convincing and Osbert s satirical touch strikes an American a bit heavily  Another half humorous likable vagabond is Leonard A  S Strong whose poems From the Dublin Streets are racily and deliciously Irish  Aldous Huxley is perhaps the most interesting of the more serious new poets in Coterie even though his prose poem Beauty is not well sustained and his six hundred  170  New English Magazines  line narrative in rhymed couplets Leda seems simply an excellent college exercise  Of the poetry in The London Mercury I confess that the most exciting entry thus far is Vachel Lindsay s rhyme in the American language Bryan Bryan But since we are not at this moment discussing our compatriot s all conquering poetic blague that singing swinging march of his which is now carrying his fame in triumph through England we may as well confess that the rest of the poetry in Mercury is less arresting than in Coterie even though the Laureate and Thomas Hardy and Austin Dobson if you please are here with brief poems The critical articles on our subject are often scholarly like Robert Lynd s study of John Donne the reviews are perhaps a little too descriptive too much cut to a pattern  The Monthly Chap book is Harold Monro s amusingly varied go as you please successor to his much larger and solemner before the war quarterly Poetry and Drama Eight numbers have appeared thus far of which three are in our specialty the first which had twenty three new poems by as many poets most of the names being familiar with Herbert Read and W P R Kern perhaps also Rodney Pasley as the more interesting of the new ones the seventh January which presents eight poets all new to us except Anna Wickham and none to give us pause and number four which contains F S Flint s latest review of recent French poetry an excellent critical summary The other numbers are devoted to rhymes for children old songs  171  quaintly illustrated stage decoration etc The Poetry Bookshop has issued also several series of Rhyme Sheets old poems with gay colored prints each on its panel for wall decoration like a kakimono  Of Art and Letters edited by Frank Rutter and Osbert Sitwell only a belated summer number has reached us Besides a few rather weak drawings and some clever prose by Dorothy Richardson Ezra Pound et al we have two pert and prancing poems from that slim thoroughbred T S Eliot and five lyrics by Isaac Rosenberg the young London poet and art student whose vivid Trench Poems were printed in POETRY in December 1916  The Rosenberg poems are accompanied by a memorial article which brings us our first information of his death in action on April first 1918 He was a Jewish boy born of poor parents in Bristol and brought up in London His talents brought him influential friends and instruction at the Slade School of Art Early in 1915 he volunteered in spite of physical disability and bravely did his part until he was killed in the great push The Trench Poems were sent to POETRY from the Front scrawled in pencil on a torn scrap of paper A letter written the month they were published ends thus We are terribly rushed winter and wet weather in the trenches is no catch  A volume of Mr Rosenberg s poems edited and arranged by Gordon Bottomley will soon be published H M  172 CORRESPONDENCE  RIDDLES AND RUNES  Dear Miss Monroe
