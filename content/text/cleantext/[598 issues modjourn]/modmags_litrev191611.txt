DOUGLAS has sued George Moore forblasphemyThe Queensburys were born to be foolswhenever art appears in England they become Wilde eyedWhoever started the tradition of George Moore s naughtinessThe Brook Kerith is as reverent as MrMoore is chasteA long time ago we usedpsycho analysison MrMoore and knew then that he could never get out of the world without writing a book about religionThe Brook Kerith is the story of the Christian religion made out of MrMoore s religionwhich is Art Windy McPherson s SonHERE is another man who hasn t written the great American novelWhere did the superstition arise which makes writersdramatistspaintersfeel that the goblins will get them if they don t hold to American subjects to make American artIt s as funny as if they should saylet s use only American made materials and we ll have an American artLandscape and atmosphere effect about the only difference of temperament in nationsAt least Art is so universal that the temperament of your nation is the only thing that can stamp your ArtYou might write about pink pagodas in China and have American artThe temperament in these American novels would make this country seem all a western plain under a steely skyIt s the same with their styleit s like going through underbrushtough and tangled and scratchynot like walking through rich old orchards or wandering in terraced gardensThey all sound as though they had been written in the morningThese writers want their novels to be strongThey arestrong like an oxnot like a tigerAnd they don t even know about these American things they are writing ofDreiser doesn t know what a genius isI meanwhat is a genius so he makes onea home made genius who comes out like home made clothesThese writers want their books to be homely the great American vicemade from the peopleby the peoplefor the peopleIt s merely another form of the glorification of sockless senatorsetcThey can t even name their books Sister CarrieJennie GerhardtWindy McPherson s Son etc etcPaderewski and Tagore San FranciscoOctober 1THIS morning I lay in bed looking at the ceiling and thinking about catsHow elegante they areand impenetrableand with what narrow slant eyed contempt they look out upon the worldPerhaps that s the way it looks through little black perpendicular slitsAnyway I thought of catsand of violin strings made of catgutand wondered about cats and musicIs it because violins are made of living things wood and catgut and mother of pearl and hairthat they make the most beautiful music in the worldThis afternoon we crossed the hills and the bay to the theatre where Paderewski was to playW e knew that Tagore was in the city tooand all the way over we speculated prayerfully as to whether he would be at the concertWe bought standing roomand stood waiting in the foyer near the tablewhere MmePaderewska was selling her dolls for the benefit of destitutePolandI looked at those dolls and wanted one so much that I was afraid I couldn t enjoy the concertThey were masterpiecesI shall make myself oneperhaps like the Polish Fausta gorgeous man with fawn colored kid bootsor perhaps like the Zazaa little girl of pale pink sateen with somewhat the look of MllePogani in the Cubist exhibitionShe had hair of red brown silk threadand her dress was emerald greenShe had little pellets of bright pink satin sewed on to make cheeks and she seets always on the piano when MrPaderewski practices I wandered back to my standing room and looked indifferently at the crowded houseThere were too many peopleI thoughtAnd then with tears hurting my eyes and an ache in my throat choking me I called out There there s Tagore in the third box and made them look quickly so they wouldn t see me cryThere he sat in the first chair in a robe the color of grass cloth and a pale violet cap upon his beadFrom where we stood it looked like a high forage capbut softand he wore great glasses made of hornThere were some East Indians with himand two Americans just menI watched him until I was almost in a trancethe angle at which his head was put onthe cheek bones that were like an extra featureEverything that lies beyond the reach of thought and wonder seemed concentrated in that dark StrangerI trembledfrightened by my imagination and a little melancholyAt last Paderewski came out to his pianoelegante and impenetrableI seemed to see him quite differently beside Tagore a bright heaven beside a still universeI was so filled there was no room left in me for the musicOnce he came back and played Schumann s Waruma nice touchWarumfor that great WondererWhat could our Warum sound like to himAll the while I watched Tagore who sat so motionlessnot seeming to be thereuntil Paderewski began some brilliant harsh thing of Liszt swhen he smiled and leaned forwardWas he thinkingWhat wonderful children these are After the concert we ran down to the front row for the encoresThe theatre was filled with all its noises of banging seats and slamming doors and people movingPaderewski looked out at them as he playedeyes narrowedwatching with contempta great catHe stoppedwaiting in silken rage for quietthen smiledraising his hand and striking the keys with a sheathed pawTagore went behindand we waited tosee him by the stage entrancein a narrow paved alley under hanging iron stairwaysHow he came out through the dusknot lookingwalking aloneAnd he went away on footsimple and mysteriousinto the crowdsWith that spell upon us we went back into the dark theatreUnder the one lightchattering women were packing the dolls and a man went about slamming up seatsAn expressman camethe trunks were taken awayand the women left as noisily as they had comeThe doors were closedand we waited in front of the theatre under a blazing white lightA reat limousine rolled upa laughing group came from the stage entrancePaderewski in a high silk hata loose cape about his shouldersHe got into the lighted carwaved his farewells to the group on the sidewalktouched a slight kiss to someoneand was driven away into the bright city Pelle the Conqueror DAYBREAKthe last of thefourPellebookswill come from the publishers this fallI wonder how many people in this country have read the other threeor have ever heard of Martin Anderson NexoI went into McClurg s last Christmas to buy the first two volumesbut they told me they had ordered only one copy and it had been soldIn all of Chicago there wasn t one to be hadThere was an epidemic of Jean Christophe hereevery one had to read it whether he was an audience for Rolland or notCritics like to compare Pelle and Jean Christophe by saying that Nexo has done for a labor leader what Rollanddid for a musicianBut he hasn tRolland tells the life of an artist and makes of it a great tractNexo tells the life of a labor leader and makes of it a great work of artThe difference is something like thisunderneath Jean Christophe lies a skeleton structure of Rolland s on which he is constantly workingthrough Christophe s experiences in artto raise a monument to the life forcein Pelle the life force sweeps all treatises from Nexo s hands and raises a monument to artLabor itself is the only thing that can help laborthe only thing except ArtPeople call read about the wrongs of labor in the social magazines until they are blindand stop outside the wordsBut here is somethingto stir the imaginationto make them feel and then to think about laborAnd the poorNexo has made an Arabian Nightsof the poorBut instead of incense and magicand white palaces with gilded domes he tells of the fragileperfect things the poor have out of Nothing out of which all beautiful things are madeThat first night in Bornholm when Pelleleft all alone in the shipyardstoops down in the half dark to see if the ground is pink as he has seen it painted on a map in Sweden that stuck me in the heartand I knew how it would be with Pelle in the endThat is the whole storyreallyPelle was always looking for the painted groundIn Daybreakalthough I have heard nothing of the bookI know Pelle finds it for himself and makes it for the poorThe boy Pelle I love mostthat imaginativecreative little Pelle who went about carving his animals and shipshelping Lasse in the cow barnsPelle the ConquerorBoyhoodApprenticeshipThe Great StruggleDaybreakby Martin Anderson NexoNew YorkHenry Holt10 The Little Review and sleeping there on the dung pilesmaking his way through the strange and violent life at Stone FarmThis Pelle seems to disappear entirely in the labor struggleduring the time when he himself feels that whatever he gains for the poor is not what the poor most needsBut through all the story the love of Pelle and Lasse runs like musicdear old smelly Lasse who was never able to match his idea of himself with the worldAfter a life of crushing labor and frustrated courage he crawls away to die in some horrible cellars under the docksbound to be independent to the lastPelle finds him therePelle who couldn t take care of one because he was caring for thousandsLike the rest of us he learned that little trick from GodPeople say to me that the town where Pelle learned his trade is overdrawn Why make a town without one normal person in it It isn t true to life It s truer than lifeit s as true as artPovertylike some great Rodinhas brought these people out of the earthsome twistedwarpedgrotesquebrutally handledothers beautiful or giganticcut passionatelytheir feet only left in the ground all part of that from which they are hewnIn the Ark Nexo shows you something quite different of the poorthe city poorMy heart always aches about the Arknot because they are so cold there and so without every last thing in the worldbut because it is such an amazing and wonderful thing to be poorNexo doesn t tell about the poor from any angle of the middle classeshe doesn t thrust upon them the psychology of any other classhe leaves them their own soulsand their own worldHe isn t writing of the abjectof failuresor of social settlement chargesHe is writing of the Poor the poor you have always with youIt isn t the things they don t have that make them so poignantit s what they haveHe tells you of one little possession and you know all they have never possessedI am waiting for the fourth volume to find out what it was that Ellen didEvery reviewer in the country has taken it for granted that Ellen resorted to prostitution to save Pelle and their children from starvationBut if I know Ellen she did nothing of the kindShe never could have done thatShe took Pelle s carving of the ten croner note and had it made int8 moneythereby causing Pelle s arrest for counterfeitingIf this isn t what happened then there is no psychology for womenOut of all the stories in Pelle I choose these threethe story of Hanneof the end of her proud youththe story the old grandmother at Kalle s tells of her loveand the story of the Great Power and his wasted ArtThere never was a story like the Great PowerIt alone tells all there is to tell of the working classeshow labor jumps at the throat of labor and the poor destroys its ownIntroducing Jean de Bosschere THE mostmodernwriter Paris can boastnot excepting Apollonaire is the word that comes from Ezra PoundHis Ulysse fait son lit was published in the August issue and I Offre de Plebs will be found in this oneHe has brought out many volumeshas been translated into Russian by Veselofskyand before the war contributed frequently to La Nouvelle Revue Française and L Occident The starting point for alsystems of aesthetics must be the personal experience of a peculiar emotionThe objects that provoke this emotion we call works of artThere must be some one quality without which a work of art cannot existpossessing whichin the least degreeno

Vergeudet EZRA POUND BEFORE you issue another number of your magazine half blankI must again ask you seriously to consider the iniquity of the presentprotectivetariff on booksThis tariff has contributed more than any other one causeand perhaps more than all other causesto the intellectual isolation of Americato her general ignoranceto her sodden parochialismI have expressed myself on this subject many timesMrGeorge Haven Putnam has been fighting against the evil for yearsIt is one ground on which all intelligent Americanswhatever their disagreements as to literary cannon may becan come togetherI am too much buried in work to write you an article at presentThere are hundreds of young men with more time than I haveto whom this is a matter not of mere general interestbut of vital and personal importanceThe simple fact is that it is veryvery difficult to get foreign books in the United StatesThere is no facilitation of their saleThe 25tariff serves as an excuse for an exorbitant

in EnglandIt hasmore than anything elsemade theEmpire I do not see why it should ruin the RepublicBut that is not my businessI meanFree Trade in the widest sense is not my present affairThe prohibitive tariff on books is very much everybody s affair if they care a hang for the intellectual state of the countryThe state of the copyright laws is barbarousbut it is perhaps more the affair of the maltreated authors than of the country at largeIt is evil only as other obstructory measures are evilBut this matter of excluding foreign books in the interest of a few artizanswho are better paid than authors and who seek nothing above immediate gainandwhose loss in the event of reform would be negligibleis immediate and vitalThe whole question of censorshipas to Dreiseras to Hokusai prints destroyed by customs officialsetc are all really minor issueslargely dependent on this matter of the exclusion of the words thought and knowledgeIf among the young writers gathered about The Little Review you can not find two or three to take up this questionto study itto marshal the datavide Putnam sBooks and Their Makersto start withrethe causes of the rise of Paris as the world s

starkFamiliesAnd ohthere are some such nice familiesBut maybe they never thought about thisThe great process ison But who d have known the earth was beginning to whirl on a new axis poking out through the crust in Mill ValleyOh I think you said a lot in a littleflaming AngelWith discernmenttooYou Were rightWhy should the pages be filled until by something that simply will not be deniedYour analysis is soundif it is in a footnoteand there s a mighty sane protest in the blank pages against the general welterIt s only the beginningIt is the beginningIt shows that even an editor may claim a little the inner sense of the dignity of lifethat the prosy demands ofa paid up constituency for fodder paid uphellmay be deliberately set aside if one needs a sweep for one s vision or room to swing an axe or a chance to breatheor if he sees a chance to save his soul by suddenly taking a firm hold on that fundamental of individualism that saysI will not do what I really don t want to doand by holding on until he s chinned himself three times whatever chinning the rest may do over itLook like the endHow can itHow can a man like FLW but maybe he s rightmaybe he means the other endmaybe he could see what a beginning it wasbut to most people it takes the actual sight of the blank pages to get a sense of what s written so clearly on themYou saw itYou felt itAnd aside from the effect it will have on the worldfor it can never again be said thatthey have to print it because they can t get anything better and it will be said many and many a time in defense of Modern The Little Review 23 Lettersor a Summary of the Best of Contemporary Thought that an editor did one time assert her belief in herselfdid blue pencil an entire issue and did contribute twelve consecutivepages to contemporary thoughtthe best thought at least that her subscribers are capable offor they re left to do their thinking for themselvesand if the thought s not as consecutive as the pages it s not the first time that that little matter has come to light when readers have been brought to bookand when you ve said something so directly thatit can never again be said it will have its effectand when you ve made a contributionto pure thought it s bound to have its effect for it s the confusion of tongues that keeps even the other kindnot impure but unpure thoughtfrom having its effect somewhere in an ineffectual world aside from the effect it will have on the world look at the impetus it gives youHere are y u withtwelve pages that you can tuck under yourarm any timeday or the black night between daysand march straight up to heaven s gate and demand a reckoning onTh e endwhen you ve here said twelve times overfor the first timeabsolutely that it s ever been perfectly said No compromise Would to God some judgehe willthey willI was near showing a lack of faith in the power of this thing you ve donesome judge will step down from his bench and leave a sentence unpronounced because the law shan t bind him to injusticeSome preacher will come to his pulpit with his manuscript a blank because he can t compel his hand to write more platitudesA thousand artist hands will break the thing they ve chiseled atand search their souls with yearning for the thing they areThe endThis will be quotedI refrain from mentioning the time when all else is piedincluding magazine magpiesand when the arch fiend has gathered disloyal architects and all their worksThis says Life is long This denies all that the poets have sungand the prophets have wailed and philosophy has deluded us withIf the poets have gathered rosebuds while they maythis makes no haste t o gather thistlesIf the Jeremiahs have said WoeWoethis saysWhoaonce and compels itand the philosophy of this thinginstead of dividingart from its essence and proclaiming that art is long and life is shortidentifies life and art and says they re both long long enoughLife is long enough for art justFor art proves itself worthy only as the work of the artist proves him able to work true while he lives and proves him great in so far as his record shows him able to live true while he worksDauber was all wrongif art is achievementor he could never have had it in him to do the thing he was to do and yet lose his grip on the yard arm however the wind blewbut he was rightwhether of life or of artin his dying cry It will go on He knew youThese pages are a record bearing on life and art and youThey say that life is long long enough for pauseslong enough that haste is your only real sacrilege and the artist s great outrage on lifeThey do not deny that the seasons are shortwhether seed time and harvest or the mating of turtle doves and snailsor even the theatrical season or the press datebut they do define an attitude towards one s workand it s the direct expression of the artist mindHere is a protest against that haste that does what it may instead of refusing to do what it must notAnd this is not youth saying I will do as I damn pleasebut judgment saying I will avoid doing what I please notnot a baby demanding the moon at allmerely a proper young entity refusing a rotten piece of cheeseAnd as for its bearing on youhere is a record The Little Review of existencearecord of a striving toward that happiness that comes through an understanding of lifea grip on life the grip that Dauber didn t haveYou have life

individualistic marrow in its bonesI glory in your shameWuzzed Thinking AnonymousRecall to mind the ultimatum of Ma x EastmanOur literary intellectuals will have to go to work Otherwise we shall merely have to enjoy them like a songThey will have to pass their examinations Science holds the power to make all intellectual literature mere dilettantism and nothing but resolute giants of brain with feeling can prevent it Reflect the philosophy of the ageand you will have served ArtDo not attempt to rise precipitously and gaze rapturously into the Blessed Islesfloating without our spheresituate in the fourth dimensionGome to Jesus Reflecting the philosophy of the age has no more to do with Art than holding the mirror up to nature The Little Review From France Muriel CiolkowskaBellevueSet OThe last number pleased me especially for your satisfying definition of art versus lifeIt is the most complete and the most epigrammatic I have ever met with My Word Louise BryantNew YorkBEAUTY O foolish ones Who lament Because all the beauty That you discover Or that you create Out of your minds Is not posted On a mountain Before the eyes of the worldKnow youIt is no less beautiful Because all do not behold itIt is no less beautiful Because it remains in darknessBeauty is the same alwaysIt is itself No less and no moreFrom Berlin Charlotte Teller To my surpriseI found that Marsden Hartley had stayed on in Berlin in spite of the warand that he was still living in the same placethe garden houseup three flightsat number four Nassauische StrasseThe world was whirling in martial mid airand all the planets were out of placeBut Hartley had the same rug on the floorand the same Persian stuff on the brown wallAnd the next room was full of canvasses some fortya fewdone in Paris when he was just beginning to want the Northern Light stronger than France could givemost of them done right here in these roomsWhen the door was closedthe room might have been a magic carpet carrying US out into anywherewhere there are planes cutting into each otherwhere lightnings zig zag outlines against black spacewhere colors refuse to fadebut stay sharp and cleanlike good moralsThe Little Review Marsden Hartley used to be told that he looked like Ralph Waldo EmersonBut since I last saw him he has lost that look of strife with the flesh which gives all Emerson s portraits a tortured undercurrentWhat was before New England philosopher with a touch of the bird of prey is now Indianthe oldrareeagle like Indian whom we have betrayed without counting the loss to the land whose life he knew back to Aztec daysOn the card over Hartley s door bell some boy has drawn in pencil an IndianIt looks like himHe does not know if it were done to protect him from being taken for an Englishmanor as a portraitIt serves ss bothThe portrait I had seen of him when I was in Berlin two years ago was a dream he told me he had hadHe had seen a pigeon tied by its feet to a great rockstruggling to get freeHe watched it in tormentand saw finally how it flew offleaving its feet bleeding upon the rockAnd he has flown farOne canvas that he showed me was painted in June1914before there had been the slightest whisper of warIt expresses his feeling of what he callsecstasyon the part of the dragoons at the manoevers he had seenA rising domethe eternal symbol of endeavor weighted by the desires of the fleshnot able to cut clean like the trianglethe flame sign of the PersiansAnd in this domeand on either sidewhite horsesmountingred trappingswhite uniformsand black bootsall of them pouring upward to a high point somewhere far outside of the painting itselfHere is the very spirit of Germanyproud of its displaynot yet chastened by the grief of gloryHe has caught Germany and Americaand grappled with them in the depths of their own consciousnessPlanetary things there are in his workgracious and balancedweird and restlesssensationshe calls them for fear of intellectualizing the emotions he hasBut it is all his worldHe does not pretend to share it with anyonealthough he spreads it before you and listensor half listensto your interpretation of circle and star and streaked skiesI dp not pretend to understand even the theories of these new schools which burst out before the warand I have no theory about Hartley s paintingsI feel themas I might feel a lyric from the Sanscrit if it were read me by one who knows that our modern speech is buried deep in this old language and must inevitably echo forthWhen the rhythm swings round and round within the four sides of the frameI know it as rhythmalthough I might not be able to tell what begot itWhen the motion set up by color and line goes sweeping out beyond the framebeyond the walls of the roombeyond Berlinand Europeand the age we live inI get the excitement of itand I don t mind the loss of breathWhat Does It MeanArthur PurdonLivingstonMontana A Real Magazinejust arrivedbut it isn tArtlike musicdies when talked aboutThe September Want Ad makes me smileThe Little Review is Regenerating into the newspaper classand has become a common beggarIt does not know how to keep its machinery out of sightI sometimes wish I knew how to make a bombIf I did I would be tempted to place it under The Little Review and blow its talk The Little Review 27 about pastpresent andfuture straight to hellI am interested in an infinite present above time and spacethat indefinable something expressed in musicThere are no such things as PastPresent and FutureThey re hollow hallucinationsThe Little Review still worships at the altar of time and attempts to concern itself with temporal thingsMusic or Art when labelled disappearThe think itself is quite sufficientDon t you sometimes get a bit tired of talking so much about Art Nowhat we get tired of is people like you and Alice Groff who talk out of the airas though thoughts are made of air as words are made OfficerShe s In AgainAlice GroffPhiladelphiaYou are an insane isolisthaha a mad little self made Godsetting yourself on a pedestal as the only judge of ArtEvery artist is the sole judge of his own artDon t you know thatYou may not like his art but you have no right to say that it is not artIt is the embodiment of his idealand this is all that art is an embodiment of an ideal by the soul that conceived the idealThere is no such thing as good art or bad artThere is only artOf courseyouas an editorcannot publish every boy s artYou must discriminate and selectto appeal as far as possible to your clienteleBut don t presume to say that what you reject is not artAll that an editor can ever be as to art is a medium between the artist and the worldAll that he can ever do isto bring the artist to the light of day that the latter may have a chance to speak the word to those of whom it is the word of lifeas it is for himselfThis is all that the editor can do for himself even as an artistThe editor who fails to do this is unworthy to be an editorWe Also Await Anonymous I have never enjoyed any number of The Little Review so much as the SeptemberThose blank pages linked with the
