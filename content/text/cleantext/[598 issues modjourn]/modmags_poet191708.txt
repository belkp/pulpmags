1917  HIGH CHIN BOB  WAY high up in the Mokiones among the mountain tops A lion cleaned a yearlin s bones and licked his thankful chops When who upon the scene should ride a trip pin down the slope But High Chin Bob of sinful pride and maverick hungry rope  Oh glory be to me says he and fame s unfadin  flowers I ride my good top hoss today and I m top hand of Lazy J So Kitty cat you re ours  The lion licked his paws so brown and dreamed soft dreams of veal   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  As High Chin s loop come circlin down and roped him round his meal He yowled quick fury to the world and all the hills yelled back That top hoss give a snort and whirled and Bob caught up the slack  Oh glory be to me says he we ll hit the glory trail No man has looped a lion s head and lived to drag the bugger dead Till I shall tell the tale  Way high up in the Mokiones that top hoss done his best Mid whippin brush and rattlin stones from cañon floor to crest Up and down and round and cross Bob pounded weak and wan But pride still glued him to his hoss and glory drove him on  Oh glory be to me says he this glory trail is rough I ll keep this dally round the horn until the toot of judgment morn Before I ll holler nough  Three suns had rode their circle home beyond the desert rim And turned their star herds loose to roam the ranges high and dim   High Chin Bob  And whenever Bob turned and hoped the limp remains to find A red eyed lion belly roped but healthy loped behind  Oh glory be to me says Bob he kaint be drug to death These heroes that I ve read about were only fools that stuck it out To the end of mortal breath  Way high up in the Mokiones if you ever come there at night You ll hear a ruckus amongst the stones that will lift your  hair with fright You ll see a cow hoss thunder by and a lion trail along And the rider bold with chin on high sings forth his glory  song  Oh glory be to me says he and to my mighty noose Oh pardner tell my friends below I took a ragin dream in tow And though I never laid him low I never turned him loose Cowboy Song Author Unknown   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SONGS OF MANY MOODS  A SONG OF HAPPINESS  So many folk are happy folk The feathered folk and furred And many a kindly glance I ve had And many a brisk bright word From squirrel and from gray fieldmouse From cardinal and blackbird  It s only folk within the wood  Can know my happiness I did not tell my secret but I heard the robins guess  The golden minnow knows it Beneath the water cress  MAHHAVIS  There is no flower that would hide from him The mystic secret that the woodland knows Not johnny jump ups in the shadows dim Not foxglove nor the delicate pale rose Nor any smallest forest thing that grows For he is lover and interpreter To all shy life that blooms or sings or goes Fur clad or winged He knows every burr  That clings to Summer s hem and each brown insect s whir   Mahhavis  He loves the screech owl and the screaming jay His heart is tender to the fleet winged swallow To sea gulls and to sparrows at their play And to the hook beaked hawks that swiftly follow The marsh hen building by the sedgy shallow Is not more gentle with her brood than he Who finds her nest beside the tall rose mallow And lifts aside the fern that he may see  Her little fledglings there and woo them cunningly  For him the forest is shot through with song Wren song and thrush song thrilling from the trees Bee song shut close in mountain pink and strong Sweet arrowy notes from bugles of the breeze With a laughing curious lover s eyes he sees The sycamores nymph white shake out their hair Green as the locks of lithe limbed Nereides All things we dream of in the forest there  Are real to him for whom a flower is a prayer  SHADOWS  I  My dreams of you are sombre in the twilight As a hedge of bramble growing interlaced A straggling little hedge with scarlet berries Sharp to the touch and bitter to the taste   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  II  This is my wrong to you O man that I love I who had all to give And would have held back naught thereof I whom love taught to live  When you asked for a loaf of my baking And a bit of blossomy spray Gave only these for your taking And hid the rest away  WIND BLOWN  I  My heart Rooted like the tree Like the tree reaches out yearning arms Clutching at the wind  II  Out of a universe of things Two only Give me any measure of peace Rain That shuts you out And wind That bears me away   Shadows  III  If for one hour One hour when the sunset is live gold I might be a little wind Running with gray feet along the edge of the world Could I not forget For one hour  COMPENSATION  I shall not grieve that you are dead I sing to you when the stars hang low And though I sang till dawn were red You still must hear you could not go  You are contented being dead You who were used to wander far Now I plant flowers at your head And steal out nightly where you are  Ah once you wandered far and long And left me waiting hopeless here Though I sent you my breaking heart in a song You were too far you could not hear  Now it is I could go oversea And though I stayed till years were sped You would lie peaceful waiting me I shall not grieve that you are dead  Muna Lee   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  KITES  High on the telephone wires the paltry pitiful thing Hangs in rags and tatters and loops of string A slight breeze shakes it but cannot shake it down It flutters and flutters forgotten above the town  I hate a stranded kite Picked to the bones where the wind has claws that tear And the rain has teeth that bite A child s is a great despair  Such a lot of paste And twine it took and wrapping or daily paper And twists for its tail lest it cut too great a caper Up in the cumulous out in the bellying buoying air Now it hangs there  My dreams are gorgeous kites like the kites Chinese I can feel them tug and yank at my brain in a breeze Shaped like serpent dragons and whiskered tigers and other  eccentric glories Such as knights and goblins and beasts out of fairy stories Hung with golden tinsel and silver and bright red fire  cracker paper Each jumper and twister and japer That cuts its frolic caper High in the buoyant blue And high as I fly them I stand a gaper At other kites Do you   Kites  My kites are great gilt angels in garments of blue With white feathered wings I scalloped from song book  pages They dip and romp In happy pomp High over the tossing trees and the houses too And afloat through the silver of night they fling bright gages At the horned stars with their luminous twinkling graces They sway on the traces Of comets and nudge the moon and smile all the while The same untiring and ineffable smile Is it painted upon their faces  My kites are huge like elephants small like mice I fly them all in a flock in spite of advice The best advice They go up in rainbow brilliance and snow white storms In all shapes and forms  Well here s their memento here s the superb ideal Clutched by the real That frail little skeleton flutters between the wires Till the eyesight tires   I turn to go Somewhat dashed somewhat dashed you know But regard that bright Bulge of gold lit glory that soars o er those roofs so white Get a golden cord I must have that cloud for a kite  William Rose Benêt   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  KIN T O SORROW  Am I kin to Sorrow That so oft Falls the knocker of my door Neither loud nor soft But as long accustomed Under Sorrow s hand Marigolds around the step And rosemary stand And then comes Sorrow And what does Sorrow care For the rosemary Or the marigolds there Am I kin to Sorrow Are we kin That so oft upon my door Oh come in  THE LITTLE TAVERN  I ll keep a little tavern Below the high hill s crest Wherein all gray eyed people May set them down and rest  There shall be plates a plenty And mugs to melt the chill   The Little Tavern Of all the gray eyed people Who happen up the hill There sound will sleep the traveler And dream his journey s end But I will rouse at midnight The falling fire to tend Aye tis a curious fancy But all the good I know Was taught me out of two gray eyes A long time ago AFTERNOO N ON A HILL I will be the gladdest thing Under the sun I will touch a hundred flowers And not pick one I will look at cliffs and clouds With quiet eyes Watch the wind bow down the grass And the grass rise And when

had little more than a startled word to give We had been too long apart And all the years I had been cold to you But the pity and pain of your leave taking filled me with  slow resentment  Once I would have cared to make a song About a flower you gave me An old rose shut in a book that is lost  I was cruel to you And you had nothing better from the rest of the world That is what made me angry  Well we can love the dead in our own way And not hurt them We can be very tender knowing well They will not come back to us  I have thoughts for you now I have words of bereavement I see how lovely and rare you were And cry out after you  Where are you now whom I played with on the sands when we both were young I remember your girl s body stocky and strong   When I Heard You Were Dead  Your little hard hand clasp Your truthful eyes Your corn pale dancing hair Growing low on your small forehead I remember you wet from the surf catching ball like a  rough boy  I know death has you That very likely you were glad to die Going out lonely and in bitterness With your dreams all crunched to black dust Too strong for life too honest too friendly and too tender  I hope if the grave has not conspired to hold you You have forgotten about all that I hope if I could come to an old sea beach white and sunny Where spirits immortally human played I would find you there O gray eyes the laughing comrade  of boys  THE ADVENTURER  I  What is he struggling to say With his red wrinkled face And clawing hands   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He has just come out of the darkness Its silence is still upon him And already he wants to talk about life  Hush Perhaps he has some great secret of birth and death  Learned back there in the black womb Which he feels life stealing And he wants to tell it to us And cannot  He is more terrible than funny  II  Gallop gallop on my knee  What a tireless rider  I didn t think of your doing this When in the stillness of night We set you stirring  Now I suppose you must keep on  If you follow your daddy You will have a merry and sad time Riding a cock horse To Banbury Cross   The Adventurer  III  Arise child in the morning Go down upon the shining beach Find the glinting shells And the white drops of moonstone  Gather and toss them away Leaping  Under the towering sky Be wild as you are white Your limbs are light and can dance  Do you know how far they

Pound  EDITORIAL COMMENT  COWBOY SONGS AND BALLADS  WE TAL K in the east of a public for poetry and  when we use this term we are usually thinking  of the public who will or who will not be  prevailed upon to buy the books of poetry  regularly issued by the standard eastern publishers But poetry existed before the printing press a platitude none the less important for being so consistently ignored that we are apt to forget that in this country there is a considerable public for poetry of which no account is taken in the yearly summaries of The Publishers Weekly I mean the public that enjoys and creates folk poetry in the United States a public much larger and more varied than we imagine And I am thinking particularly of the public that enjoys the folk poetry of the west and south west the cowboy songs the songs of the rangers songs of border outlaws prospectors hoboes and other lonely outriders of civilization To show that this public exists even though no account is taken of it in the publishers lists of best sellers I offer the story I heard recently of a cowboy down on his luck who had printed a collection of cowboy songs which he had heard and remembered and some of which he had written himself and sold enough copies of the little paper bound volume to set himself up in business again By that I do not mean that he sold enough to buy himself a new outfit a forty dollar saddle   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  on a twenty dollar horse and start punching cattle again No the sum made on the little volume I have one here at my hand was very much more than that it would have made any popular eastern poet envious And the book was sold not at bookstores or newsstands but like the old country broadsides at cow camps and round ups and cattle fairs  The story is interesting because it shows that this poetry and this public constitute a world quite as distinct as that of Irish balladry although unlike many Irish folk songs these western songs have no literary ancestry Moreover although one may trace in some instances survivals of old English or Scotch folk songs as one finds them in the mountainous and isolated districts of certain eastern states these western songs for the most part spring direct from the soil They constitute perhaps our most indigenous folk poetry Too little attention has been paid indeed to the purely indigenous folk poetry of the United States excepting of course negro folk songs Perhaps it is because the folk lore societies seem to pay so much more attention to tracing European survivals that it is commonly assumed that we have none  Mr John A Lomax s Cowboy Songs first printed in 1910 and soon to be republished by the Sturgis amp Walton Company has done much to correct that impression in one field at least In this book he has collected over a hundred and fifty of these cowboy songs and frontier ballads They have come to be sung he tells us in the loneliness of night herding of driving the cattle north over the long trails in cow camps in winter or around the camp fire on the marches   Cowboy Songs and Ballads  The song making did not cease as the men went up the trail Indeed the songs were here utilized for very practical ends Not only were sharp rhythmic yells sometimes beaten into verse employed to stir up lagging cattle but also during the long watches the night guards as they rode round and round the herd improvised cattle lullabies which quieted the animals and soothed them to sleep Some of the best of the so called dogie songs seem to have been created for the purpose of preventing cattle stampedes such songs coming straight from the heart of the cowboy speaking familiarly to his herd in the stillness of the night  The songs of this character are among the best in the book not only the dogie songs that is but the songs of a lyric character such as The Cowboy s Lament with its naive death bed repentance  It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing It was once in the saddle I used to be gay First to the dram house then to the card house Got shot in the breast I am dying today  Oh beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly Play the Dead March as you carry me along Take me to the green valley there lay the sod o er me For I m a young cowboy and I know I ve done wrong  Or The Old Chisholm Trail  Feet in the stirrups and seat in the saddle I hung and rattled with them long horn cattle  Fully half the songs in the book however are of a narrative character recounting the exploits of cowboys or bandits or other border heroes and not a few of them describing with graphic vividness the hardships of the particular job undertaken whether rounding up cattle busting broncos or eluding the sheriff  Mr Lomax says that he has in some instances selected and put together what seem to him the best lines in several ver   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  sions of the same song but he has left out one very telling line the third in the version of Jesse James published in the American Folk Lore Journal  It was on Friday night the moon was shinin bright  An Jesse was standin fore his glass  Robert Ford s pistol ball brought him tremblin from the wall  An they laid poor Jesse in his grave  In rhythm and movement the songs follow for the most part a simple ballad structure and their diction is full of the vitality of the soil of the life that has produced them We regret with Mr Lomax that so much picturesque profanity has had to be left out and we wonder if he and his publishers are wholly justified in doing so if he needed to tone down the phrasing as much as he thought As for those songs that could not be printed at all we regret them too Personally I do not believe that the American public is as puritanical as the press would have us believe It is an advantageous form of advertising at times for work that requires advertising Of course the Comstocks and their successors exist but they are no gauge of the public and I hardly think that cowboy profanity or descriptive epithet is the kind of immorality supposedly that would give the Comstockians a thrill However that may be we hope that in a later edition Mr Lomax will feel that he can avail himself of a little more liberty in this respect and not give us songs with the edge taken off  Incidentally it has occurred to me to wonder why there are no songs of sheep herders in Mr Lomax s book but I suppose it is because so large a majority of the sheep herders are Mexican and sing in Spanish It would be interesting   Cowboy Songs and Ballads  to have their songs transcribed and translated as another contribution to the national fund of folk poetry  We are fortunate this month through the courtesy of Mr H H Knibbs in being able to present a cowboy song High Chin Bob which is not included in Mr Lomax s book and which has never been published so far as we know Mr Knibbs found the song in southern Arizona the Mokiones being a corruption of the Mogollons the mountains in the southern part of New Mexico and Arizona This song of the cowboy who belly roped a lion and who never left the glory trail although he found it rough is certainly a classic of the southwest It has a swing and a precision of phrasing rare enough in any poetry Whoever the unknown author may be on whichever side of the Great Divide he is to be congratulated A C H  TO THE WILDERNESS  In the Yale Review for July Mr Henry Seidel Canby discusses the American impulse to take to the woods an impulse reflected by American writers He thinks that this survival of the pioneering instinct springs from a deep subconsciousness in the heart of the people He says  Since our writing ceased being colonial English and began to reflect a race in the making the note of woods longing has been so insistent that one wonders whether here is not to be found at last the characteristic trait that we have all been patriotically seeking It represents a search for a tradition and its capture  We all remember the first Thanksgiving day of the pilgrim fathers they decreed a feast because they had so nearly   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  starved before the gathering of their first harvest I had always read the story with solemn sympathy for the pilgrims until that hardy woodsman Hamlin Garland pointed out how absurd it was to starve in those forests filled with game The fools he said they hadn t sense enough to learn of the Indians they couldn t eat until they had cleared some land and grown grain But their sons learned he added reflectively  And their sons have been learning ever since The early settlers who hadn t much art had to go to nature for beauty and their children whose art is largely derived not a spontaneous self expression but an inheritance or the imitation of an inheritance their children still go back to nature for the most simple and direct communion with beauty Confused and wearied by bad art for poor design in architecture poor color and form in house interiors furnishings dress etc poor literature in current books and prints poor music in clattering rhythms of vicious noise are all bad art and therefore infinitely confusing and wearying their children throw on civilization the blame for ugliness and go to the wilds to satisfy their unconquerable need of beauty And out of this refreshment this re creation in nature may indeed spring as Mr Canby suggests an art more indigenous and original more truly our own than all the feudal operas we sing or the Doric temple railway stations we build  I sometimes think that the race will be saved through love of nature saved at last from the collective rapacity of greed and the collective violence of war Such anachronisms can   To the Wilderness  not long survive among people who continually test their living and thinking by immediate contacts with wild beauty and primitive simplicity Our own inheritance of vast areas of mountain and desert forest lake and sea coast areas which can never be civilized and which in some cases the government is preserving as national parks may be regarded as our most precious possession an ever flowing fountain of youth for the nation  And what will our poets do with this inheritance At the beginning of the nineteenth century after two hundred years of pioneering they had learned less from the Indian than those early Mayflower pilgrims and so strong was the colonial instinct that it took another half century to get the lark out of American song Even when the poets began to be aware of the out of doors it was rural nature not the wilderness which appealed to them as in these home bound lines from the hymn which we all sing to a foreign air  I love thy rocks and rills Thy woods and templed hills  Here the poet s vision was limited by a gentle village slope with granite out cropping by the stream and a church half hidden among the trees Emerson went further but even his woodland poems are rural not wild Whittier had one or two instants of a keener thrill also Bryant in his youth but none of that sheltered group journeyed far from his cottage or ever felt the keen agonies and glories of nature in her own domain  Thoreau and Whitman were the first to shake off the dust of civilization with them the new era begins but Thoreau   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  never went west of Walden how he would have grown in Arizona and Whitman deep lover that he was of sea and sky and the plains yet always peopled his great spaces be it with no more than a bird calling its mate  The Anglo Saxon voyagers of six to eight centuries ago knew and loved and hated the sea and in their sea songs is the power and grandeur of the wilderness beyond anything since attained in English poetry Who that has read Mr Pound s marvelous translation of The Sea farer has not felt in it a deep and bitter sense of nature missed by even the masters of English song Shakespeare has some wonderful lines about the sea he felt it as England s protector and possession Byron hurled some magnificent rhetoric at not only the sea but the mountains the first English poet to be intimately moved by mountains which is not strange since there are no mountains in England And Swinburne loved the sea as well as a landsman can gave it long odes of rhythmic praise But the unknown author of The Sea farer knew and sang the sea as his lover and enemy slave and master as the vastness immeasurable out of which he was born and into which at last he would sink like a spent seagull in a storm  From the formation of the English language this note of wildness is rarely heard A few of the old ballads have it but rarely the great English masters We get the tang of it from Ireland from Synge especially from Yeats and Colum with a special Celtic flavor but coming as it were from dells and clearings not from great spaces   To the Wilderness  Perhaps it remains for our poets to feel wild immensities on land as the old Anglo Saxon poet felt them at sea They made a good beginning with Whitman and we feel the authentic note in scattered songs from a few of the later nineteenth century poets less often from Bret Harte and Joaquin Miller the poet of the Sierras than from Hamlin Garland and poets more obscure And we feel it today in many varying voices in the poems from Indian motives of Dr Gordon Miss Skinner Mrs Austin Alice Corbin and others as well as in direct translations by Natalie Curtis and other students in John Gould Fletcher s poems of Arizona and other wild places in C E S Wood s Poet in the Desert in Edith Wyatt s spacious poems of the Great Lakes and the western heights in Vachel Lindsay s poems of Kansas and the plains And the spirit of it though not precisely the locale one finds in such a poem as Mr Frost s Snow in certain things by Mr Masters Mr Sandburg Mr Johns and in H D who however preoccupied with Greek symbols is essentially a poet of wild nature a daughter of the pioneers and more closely related to them in feeling than many whose locale is more obviously theirs  American poets may bear great gifts to the mother tongue and those who speak it perhaps before this century is over If they can bring the art back to nature they will achieve a real refreshment perhaps a re creation of the race  H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REVIEWS  T S ELIOT  Prufrock and Other Observations by T S Eliot The  Egoist London I n y a de livres que ceux où un écrivain s est raconté lui même en racontant es moeurs de ses contemporains leurs rêves leurs vanités leurs amours et leurs folies Remy de Gourmont  De Gourmont uses this sentence in writing of the incontestable superiority of Madame Bovary L Éducation Sentimentale and Bouvard et Pécuchet to Salammbô and La Tentation de St Antoine A casual thought convinces one that it is true for all prose Is it true also for poetry One may give latitude to the interpretation of rêves the gross public would have the poet write little else but De Gourmont keeps a proportion The vision should have its place in due setting if we are to believe its reality  The few poems which Mr Eliot has given us maintain this proportion as they maintain other proportions of art After much contemporary work that is merely factitious much that is good in intention but impotently unfinished and incomplete much whose flaws are due to sheer ignorance which a year s study or thought might have remedied it is a comfort to come upon complete art naive despite its intellectual subtlety lacking all pretence  It is quite safe to compare Mr Eliot s work with anything written in French English or American since the death of Jules Laforgue The reader will find nothing better and he will be extremely fortunate if he finds much half as good   T S Eliot  The necessity or at least the advisability of comparing English or American work with French work is not readily granted by the usual English or American writer If you suggest it the Englishman answers that he has not thought about it he does not see why he should bother himself about what goes on south of the channel the American replies by stating that you are no longer American and I have learned by long experience that this is the bitterest epithet in his vocabulary The net result is that it is extremely difficult to read one s contemporaries After a time one tires of promise  I should like the reader to note how complete is Mr Eliot s depiction of our contemporary condition He has not confined himself to genre nor to society portraiture His  lonely men in shirt sleeves leaning out of windows are as real as his ladies who come and go  Talking of Michaelangelo His one night cheap hotels are as much there as are his four wax candles in the darkened room Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead An atmosphere of Juliet s tomb And above all there is no rhetoric although there is Elizabethan reading in the background Were I a French critic skilled in their elaborate art of writing books about books I should probably go to some length discussing Mr Eliot s two sorts of metaphor his wholly unrealizable always apt half ironic suggestion and his precise realizable picture It would be possible to point out his method of conveying a   POETRY A Magazine o Verse  whole situation and half a character by three words of a quoted phrase his constant aliveness his mingling of very subtle observation with the unexpectedness of a backhanded cliché It is however extremely dangerous to point out such devices The method is Mr Eliot s own but as soon as one has reduced even a fragment of it to formula someone else not Mr Eliot someone else wholly lacking in his aptitudes will at once try to make poetry by mimicking his external procedure And this indefinite someone will needless to say make a botch of it  For what the statement is worth Mr Eliot s work interests me more than that of any other poet now writing in English The most interesting poems in Victorian English are Browning s Men and Women or if that statement is too absolute let me contend that the form of these poems is the most vital form of that period of English and that the poems written in that form are the least like each other in content Antiquity gave us Ovid s Heroides and Theocritus woman using magic The form of Browning s Men and Women is more alive than the epistolary form of the Heroides Browning included a certain amount of ratiocination and of purely intellectual comment and in just that proportion he lost intensity Since Browning there have been very few good poems of this sort Mr Eliot has made two notable additions to the list And he has placed his people in contemporary settings which is much more difficult than to render them with mediaeval romantic trappings If it is permitted to make comparison with a different art   T S Eliot  let me say that he has used contemporary detail very much as Velasquez used contemporary detail in Las Meninas the cold gray green tones of the Spanish painter have it seems to me an emotional value not unlike the emotional value of Mr Eliot s rhythms and of his vocabulary  James Joyce has written the best novel of my decade and perhaps the best criticism of it has come from a Belgian who said All this is as true of my country as of Ireland Eliot has a like ubiquity of application Art does not avoid universal it strikes at them all the harder in that it strikes through particulars Eliot s work rests apart from that of the many new writers who have used the present freedoms to no advantage who have gained no new precisions of language and no variety in their cadence His men in shirtsleeves and his society ladies are not a local manifestation they are the stuff of our modern world and true of more countries than one I would praise the work for its fine tone its humanity and its realism for all good art is realism of one sort or another  It is complained that Eliot is lacking in emotion La Figlia che Piange is sufficient confutation to that rubbish  If the reader wishes mastery of regular form the Conversation Galante is sufficient to show that symmetrical form is within Mr Eliot s grasp You will hardly find such neatness save in France such modern neatness save in Laforgue  De Gourmont s phrase to the contrary notwithstanding the supreme test of a book is that we should feel some unusual   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  intelligence working behind the words By this test various other new books that I have or might have beside me go to pieces The barrels of sham poetry that every decade and school and fashion produce go to pieces It is sometimes extremely difficult to find any other particular reason for their being so unsatisfactory I have expressly written here not intellect but intelligence There is no intelligence without emotion The emotion may be anterior or concurrent There may be emotion without much intelligence but that does not concern us  Versification  A conviction as to the rightness or wrongness of vers libre is no guarantee of a poet I doubt if there is much use trying to classify the various kinds of vers libre but there is an anarchy which may be vastly overdone and there is a monotony of bad usage as tiresome as any typical eighteenth or nineteenth century flatness  In a recent article Mr Eliot contended or seemed to contend that good vers libre was little more than a skilful evasion of the better known English metres His article was defective in that he omitted all consideration of metres depending on quantity alliteration etc in fact he wrote as if metres were measured by accent This may have been tactful on his part it may have brought his article nearer to the comprehension of his readers that is those of the New Statesman in which the article appeared people who are chiefly concerned with sociology of the button and unit variety But he came nearer the fact when he   T S Eliot  wrote elsewhere No vers is libre for the man who wants to do a good job  Alexandrine and other grammarians have made cubbyholes for various groupings of syllables they have put names upon them and have given various labels to metres consisting of combinations of these different groups Thus it would be hard to escape contact with some group or other only an encyclopedist could ever be half sure he had done so The known categories would allow a fair liberty to the most conscientious traditionalist The most fanatical vers librist will escape them with difficulty However I do not think there is any crying need for verse with absolutely no rhythmical basis  On the other hand I do not believe that Chopin wrote to a metronome There is undoubtedly a sense of music that takes count of the shape of the rhythm in a melody rather than of bar divisions which came rather late in the history of written music and were certainly not the first or most important thing that musicians tried to record The creation of such shapes is part of thematic invention Some musicians have the faculty of invention rhythmic melodic Likewise some poets  Treatises full of musical notes and of long and short marks have never been convincingly useful Find a man with thematic invention and all he can say is that he gets what the Celts call a chune in his head and that the words go into it or when they don t go into it they stick out and worry him   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  You can not force a person to play a musical masterpiece correctly even by having the notes correctly printed on the paper before him neither can you force a person to feel the movement of poetry be the metre regular or irregular I have heard Mr Yeats trying to read Burns struggling in vain to fit the Birks o Aberfeldy and Bonnie Alexander into the mournful keen of the Wind among the Reeds Even in regular metres there are incompatible systems of music  I have heard the best orchestral conductor in England read poems in free verse poems in which the rhythm was so faint as to be almost imperceptible He read them with the author s cadence with flawless correctness A distinguished statesman read from the same book with the intonations of a legal document paying no attention to the movement inherent in the words before him I have heard a celebrated Dante scholar and mediaeval enthusiast read the sonnets of the Vita Nuova as if they were not only prose but the ignominious prose of a man devoid of emotions an utter castration  The leader of orchestra said to me There is more for a musician in a few lines with something rough or uneven such as Byron s  There be none of Beauty s daughters With a magic like thee than in whole pages of regular poetry Unless a man can put some thematic invention into vers libre he would perhaps do well to stick to regular metres which have certain chances of being musical from their form and certain other chances of being musical through   T S Eliot  his failure in fitting the form In vers libre his sole musical chance lies in invention  Mr Eliot is one of the very few who have brought in a personal rhythm an identifiable quality of sound as well as of style And at any rate his book is the best thing in poetry since for the sake of peace I will leave that date to the imagination I have read most of the poems many times I last read the whole book at breakfast time and from flimsy and grimy proof sheets I believe these are test conditions Confound it the fellow can write we may as well sit up and take notice E P  WAR POEMS  Rhymes of a Red Cross Man by Robert W Service Barse  amp Hopkins New York War Flames by John Curtis Underwood Macmillan Co A Song of the Guns by Gilbert Frankau Houghton Mifflin  Co The Cause Poems of the War by Lawrence Binyon  Houghton Mifflin Co All s Well by John Oxenham Geo H Doran Co Soldier Poets Songs of the Fighting Men Erskine Mac  donald London  The number of volumes of war verse now offered to the public show that the poets are making an effort at least to express the fever in men s blood And most of these books are deeply touching they make a poignant appeal to the heart Their authors whether born poets or not are   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  sincerely moved by the passion of the time the immensity of the crisis tends to sweep away self consciousness and affectation  To try to sift out the poetry from these throbbing outcries is perhaps our business a business which once begun time will continue without our aid A magic magnet would pick up out of the mass only a small percentage of pure metal and that often from hidden and humble sources For example I had a curious experience with Mr Service s book After noting Mr Witter Bynner s praise of it in the Dial his generous acclaim of this adventurous Yukon trailer as a poet of a high order I read the book through almost persuading myself the while that I agreed perhaps Mr Bynner was right perhaps Mr Service s large public was right here was indeed a younger Kipling racing through war s marching rhythms and rising to lyric flights of song Could it be was this Red Cross man from the Yukon the real thing Then I happened to open Soldier Poets and turn to a chance song of a soldier now dead Captain Grenfell of the Royal Dragoons and as I read Into Battle quoted below part of it as lyric as the song of a thrush Mr Service s deliberate rhyming fell to its own lower place Poignant and sympathetic as he is keen and racy pathetic and humorous in his presentation of the life and feelings of the rank and file his poems are after all talk about it and about in none of them does he utter the very heart cry of the emotion  On the lower plane of poetry made rather than sung some of the Red Cross Rhymes are very good indeed Here   War Poems  for example is half of The Call which rings brazen bells  Far and near high and clear  Hark to the call of War Over the gorse and the golden dells Ringing and swinging of clamorous bells Praying and saying of wild farewells  War War War  High and low all must go  Hark to the shout of War Leave to the women the harvest yield Gird ye men for the sinister field A sabre instead of a scythe to wield  War Red War  Everywhere thrill the air  The maniac bells of War There will be little of sleeping to night There will be wailing and weeping to night Death s red sickle is reaping to night  War War War  We have also the touching Fleurette the tragic On the Wire or those dialect pieces which seem almost the very Kipling The Red Retreat especially and My Prisoner and The Stretcher bearer The book gives us if not quite the ultimate tragedy and mystery if not the agony and wild humor and fearful rapture of war at least popular versions of all these things versions which tell about them convincingly and pass current  Mr Frankau s book is a slighter essay of the same kind also in rhyme and written on the spot out of an Englishman s personal experience I wish I could quote the whole of Gun teams which has a heart for the suffering dumb brutes of battle poor relations of Job s war horse It begins like this   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Their rugs are sodden their heads are down their tails are turned to the storm Would you know them you that groomed them in the sleek fat days of peace When the tiles rang to their pawings in the lighted stalls and warm Now the foul clay cakes on breeching strap and clogs the quick release  The blown rain stings there is never a star the tracks are rivers of slime You must harness up by guesswork with a failing torch for  Instep deep in unmade standings for it s active service time And our resting weeks are over and we move the guns to night Lawrence Binyon s book is rhymed eloquence rather than poetry turgid eloquence in formal odes like Thunder on the Downs and The Antagonists but more simple and effective in a few of the short poems like these lines from The Fourth of August  For us the glorious dead have striven They battled that we might be free We to their living cause are given We arm for men that are to be  Endure O Earth And thou awaken Purged by this dreadful winnowing fan O wronged untamable unshaken Soul of divinely suffering man  All s Well by John Oxenham an English poet of wide circulation belongs obviously to journalism Its motive is frankly didactic and religious all is well the war will bring men back to God to Christ For the Men at the Front is a good sonorous hymn as hymns go and now and then some poem Christ s All or A Little Te Deum almost persuades   War Poems  one that Mr Oxenham might be a poet if he were not so eager to drive his lesson home  Mr Underwood s book War flames is on a higher plane than most of these accomplishing perhaps everything but the miracle It is as the slip cover says a poetic panorama of the war a crowded frieze showing the marching of all nations through the terrors and agonies of the cataclysmic struggle It has processional feeling largeness of plan breadth of sweep like the moving pictures from the various fronts it should bring home to our sheltered and peace stubborn people the bitter meanings of war The poet has felt them from afar he presents his impressions with descriptive power and his limitations are those of many decorative painters of our time who are camera tempted to crowd their canvases and systematize their impressions and who lack the magic touch the final rhythmic instinct for selection and composition  The book moves through all the twelve war riven countries from Belgium to Roumania with Our Share for an Envoy but its plan is too monotonous missing the epic love of shape and climax Its free verse rolls along sonorously as a rule with an effect of biblical rhythms as in these lines from Atrocities  Into Belgium in a gray green flood the marching regiments are pouring They sweep with the surge of a tidal wave filling and wrecking villages and cities For behind them a void of greed and hatred has been stirred as the sea stirs when volcanoes vomit from the ocean s bottom And old and abysmal shames and horrors are spewed from the slime of sixty sunken centuries   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The little anthology Soldier Poets collects wandering songs of men actually at the front many of whom are now dead Whether good or bad such poems have a poignant appeal and it is astonishing how often their simplicity and candor becomes lyric rising beyond the reach of more deliberate art I have felt flashes of this quality in five or six of these poets but especially in two Geoffrey Howard and Julian Grenfell From the former who is fortunately still alive we have the proud and soul stirring hymn of war Without Shedding of Blood of which we quote the beginning  God gave us England from of old  But we held light the gift He gave Our royal birthright we have sold And now the land we lost for gold  Only our blood can save  Not till thousands have been slain Shall the green wood be green again Not till men shall fall and bleed Can brown ale taste like ale indeed Blood and blood must yet be shed  To make the roses red  As a finale we must offer our readers Into Battle by Julian Grenfell who died of his wounds in May 1915 This young dragoon officer was a mighty hunter in India a champion boxer in Africa and a rather poor poet until the martial muse inspired him with one of the finest songs of war ever written It has weak places but we quote it entire  The naked earth is warm with spring And with green grass and bursting trees   War Poems  Leans to the sun s gaze glorying And quivers in the sunny breeze And Life is Color and Warmth and Light And a striving evermore for these And he is dead who will not fight And who dies fighting has increase  The fighting man shall from the sun Take warmth and life from the glowing earth  Speed with the light foot winds to run And with the trees to newer birth And find when fighting shall be done Great rest and fulness after dearth  All the bright company of Heaven Hold him in their high comradeship The Dog Star and the Sisters Seven Orion s Belt and sworded hip  The woodland trees that stand together They stand to him each one a friend They gently speak in the windy weather They guide to valley and ridge s end  The kestrel hovering by day  1 he little owl that calls by night Bid him be swift and keen as they As keen of ear as swift of fight  The blackbird sings to him Brother brother If this be the last song you shall sing Sing well for you may not sing another Brother sing  In weary doubtful waiting hours Before the brazen frenzy starts The horses show him nobler powers O patient eyes courageous hearts  And when the burning moment breaks And all things else are out of mind And only Joy of Battle takes Him by the throat and makes him blind   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Through joy and blindness shall he know Not caring much to know that still Nor lead nor steel shall reach him so That it be not the Destined Will  The thundering line of battle stands  And in the air Death moans and sings  But Day shall clasp him with strong hands And Night shall fold him in soft wings Who will make up the final anthology of this war the  one which time will ratify Will any of us even the  youngest be here to read it And how many of the names  would we know H M CORRESPONDENCE  Our correspondence is enriched this month by two com  munications in verse  UNBOUND Tired Of procrustean
