FEBRUARY1915 No11 Our First Year MARGARET CANDERSONAn interesting man said recently that the five qualities which go into the making of the great personality of the geniusperhaps are1energy 2imagination 3 character 4intellect 5and charmI number them because the importance of his remark lies in the fact that he arranged them in just that orderThe more you think of it the keener a judgment it seemsI can see only one possible flaw in it a flaw that would not be correctedI am certainby moving number four to the place of number onebut by a reversal of number one and number twoEnergy does seem the prime requisite after you ve spent a few days with one of those persons who has seething visions and a contempt for concentrationBut Imagination that gift of the far gods There is simply no question of its position in the listIt is first by virtue of every brave and beautiful thing that has been accomplished in the worldLast March we began the publication of THE LITTLE REVIEWNowtwelve months laterwe face the humiliating or the encouraging spectacle of being a magazine whose function is not transparentPeople are always asking me what we are really trying to doWe have not set forth a policy we have not identified ourselves with a point of viewexcept in so far as we have been quite ridiculously appreciativewe have not expounded a philosophyexcept in so far as we have been quite outlandishly anarchistic we have been uncriticalindiscriminatejuvenileexuberantchaoticamateurishemotionaltiresomely enthusiasticand a lot of other things which I can t remember now all the things that are usually said about faulty new undertakingsThe encouraging thing is that they are said most strongly about promising onesOf course THE LITTLE REVIEW has done little more than approach Copyright1915by Margaret CAnderson2 the ideal which it has in mindI am not proud of those limitations mentioned aboveand I am far from being unconscious of themI am merely glad that they happen to be that particular type of limitation rather than some otherFor instanceI should much rather have the limitations of the visionary or the poet or the prophet than those of the pedant or the priest or thepracticalpersonPersonallyI should much rather get drenched than to go always fortified with an umbrella and overshoes I should rather see one side of a question violently than to see both sides calmlyI should rather be an extremist than a wellit s scarcely a matter of choicepeople are either extremists or nonentities I should far rather sense the big things about a cause or a character even vaguely than to analyze its little qualities quite clearlyin shortI should rather feel a great deal and know a little than feel a little and know a lotAnd so all this may serve to express our negative attitudeBut what am I to say about our positive attitude how possibly express all the things we hope to do Perhaps I need not try Oscar Wilde made explanations of such a position superfluous when he said that the worship of beauty is something entirely too splendid to be saneThat is our only attitudeI hope at least half the people who read this will understand that I did not say our platform is merely the worship of beautyBeauty involves too many elements to be championed lightlyBeauty from the aesthete s point of view and beauty from the artist s point of view are two widely different thingsI might paraphrase Wilde and say that the new Beauty is the new HellenismCertainly I want for TH E LITTLE REVIEWas I want from lifenot merely beautynot merely happinessbut a quality which proceeds from the intensity with which both beauty and uglinesspleasure and painare presentThis much to start withNow there are people who complain that within their limited allowance of magazines they are forced to do without THE LITTLE REVIEW because it gives them nothing definitenothing finishednothing conclusiveBut my idea of a magazine which makes any claim to artistic value is that it should be conducted more or less on the lines of good dramaor good fictionthat it should suggestnot concludethat it should stimulate to thinking rather than dictate thoughtMost magazines have efficient editors and definite editorial policies that is what s wrong with themI have none of the qualifications of the editorthat s why I think THE LITTLE REVIEW is in good handsBecause the editorial tradition in this country has usurped the place of the literary tradition we have lifted loyalty to policies into the place of loyalty to idealsA veteran editor a man of letters once told me that there were fifty good writers to every good editor in Americaand that he would teach me to be the formerHe proceeded to illustratenot by chucking out the poor stuff that was being written for his journal but by showing how it could be stuck in where it wouldn t be too noticeable When some manuscript that delighted his soul came inhe was very human and out of sympathy with the crustedpolicythat had somehow grown up around his own magazinehe taught me theartof reducing its policy to a state of negativeness that would not be out of harmony with the policy he was supposed to be supportingOnce he received some poetry that was very strong and very beautifulHe treasured it so that he kept it in his desk for months before returning itIt was so beautiful as to be beyond the appreciation of his audiencehe was sure and anyhow his journal had never gone in for publishing poetry it merely printed reviews of poetryso what could he do but return itI used to feel that I was in the midst of some demoniacal scheme for achieving the ultimate futilityAnd so I think thatpoliciesare likely to beor to becomequite damning thingsTherefore instead of urging people to read us in the hope of finding what they seek in that directionit is more honest to say outright that they will probably find less and less of itBecause assanityincreases in the world TH E LITTLE REVIEW will strive more and more to be splendidly insane as editors and lecturers continue to compromise in order to get their publicas book makers continue to print rot in order to make fortunesas writers continue to follow the market instead of doing their Workas the public continues to demand vileness and vulgarity and liesas the intellectuals continue to miss the root of the troubleTH E LITTLE REVIEW will continue to rebelto tell the truth as we see itto work for its ideal rather than for a policyAnd in the face of new magazines of excellent quality and no personality we shall continue to soar and flash and flameto be swamped at intervals and scramble to new heightsto be young and fearless and reckless and imaginativechanter Reverrirepasserêtre seulêtre libreAvoir lil qui regarde bienla voix qui vibre to die for these things if necessarybut to live for them vividly firstThere are other people who argue that we might be hugely successful by being betterthat we might borrow a lot of moneythey always say this so casually pay high for contributionsbecome acutely sophisticatedfill a wide felt needetcNow the first thing we shall doas soon as we are able to pay our printer s bills without paroxysms of terroris to pay for contributions it is disgusting that writers who do real work don t make enough out of it to live on at leastBut as things are now no one can live by writing unless he writes badlyThe only exceptions are cases which emphasize rather than disprove the pointIn the meantime a magazine ought to be started for the sole purpose of printing the good things that the best magazines rejectUntil we are on our feet and able to pay for stuff we can at least do thisAnd neverwe hopewill we achieve that last emptiness sophisticationBut there is still another functionand it seems to me very importantI have been reading a new book of Walter Lippmann s called Drift and The Little Review Masterywhich has more of the quality known as straight thinking than anything in the political economic field published for a long timeMrLippmann says this in his preface The issues that we face are very different from those of the last century and A halfThe differenceI thinkmight be summed up roughly this way those who went before inherited a conservatism and overthrew itwe inherit freedomand have to use itThe sanctity of propertythe patriarchal familyhereditary castethe dogma of sinobedience to authoritythe rock of agesin briefhas been blasted for usThose who are young today are born into a world in which the foundations of the older order survive only as habits or by defaultSo Americans can carry through their purposes when they have themIf the standpatter is still powerful amongst us it is because we have not learned to use our powerand direct it to fruitful endsThe American conservativeit seems to mefills the vacuum where democratic purpose should beSo far as we are concernedthenthe case is made out against absolutismcommercial oligarchyand unquestioned creedsThe Rebel program is statedScientific invention and blind social currents have made the old authority impossible in factthe artillery fire of the iconoclasts has shattered its prestigeWe inherit a rebel traditionThe dominant forces in our world are not the sacredness of property nor the intellectual leadership of the priest they are not the divinity of the constitutionthe glory of the industrial pushVictorian sentimentNew England respectabilitythe Republican partyor John DRockefeller In the emerging morality the husband is not regarded as the proprietor of his wifenor the parents as autocrats over the childrenThere is a wide agreement among thinking people that the body is not a filthy thingand that to implant in a child the sense of sin is a poor preparation for a temperate lifeThe battle for usin shortdoes not lie against crusted prejudicebut against the chaos of a new freedomThat is very good reasoningif you grant the premise which I do notI think the old authority is just as apparent as ever its methods and nature have merely changedMrLippmann lives among the small minoritythe people who have ideasThey represent about one tenth of the populationOf the restfive tenths have no ideas and the other four tenths have something they call ideas the rock of agesIt is still thereThe new authority is quite as strong as the oldand more insidious because it is more subtleYoung people used to be disinherited when they disagreed with their parents now they are argued withThe former method left their minds clearthe latter befogs them and they disinherit themselvesThat is the differenceOne worked from without in the other works from within outOf course it s much better this wayBut this is not the most important problem this of the old rock of agesThe horrible joke of modern life is that we have been presented with a new rock of ages The rebel program is stated exactlyMore than thatit is in actionThe difference between the new issues and the oldto MrLippmannis that we have now learned what we must do to meit is that we must learn to do something elseThe battle lies not against the chaos of a new freedombut against the dangers of a new authorityBefore I definelet me illustrateAbout two months ago I spent four days in one of our second large cities a place of about two hundred thousand peopleIf I could only describe those four days and their stimulation to fresh rebellionThe people I saw belonged to the supposedly enlightened inner circles the representative upper middle class the ones that still loom very large in comparison to the thinking minority from whom MrLippmann draws his conclusionsWellI had not forgotten how ignorant people can bebut I had forgotten how cruel they can beI had not expected their knowledge to have increasedbut their hypocrisy to have lessenedI had not looked for vision but at least for a beginning of sight not for Truthbut perhaps for a willingness to stop lyingAnd I found scarcely a glimmer of these thingsIt was ghastlyBut the strange part was this all the time I found I was thinking not of the great faults of their opinions but of the great barrenness of their livesOver and over the thought kept running through my headThere is no poetry of living in this place This brings me to my pointThe new rock of ages is that wholly false perspective which assumes that what one thinks is more important than what one feelsIt has been set upquite unconsciouslyby the very people who have trying to blast the old oneIt is that perspective which the new generation must fight not only with the oldbut in its own ranks Here is the interest of the new battle Our next renaissance will be concerned with changing that perspectivethe genius of the future must be directed toward that endAnd that is why I think it is not enough to say that there will come a time when men will think of nothing but educationThere will come a time when men will think of nothing but education in imaginationAnd since there is no such thing as education in imaginationbut only procreation of itwellthe time will come when men will think of nothing but artThe crimes of ignorance are not comparable to the crimes of philistinism there is no philosophy that will ever reach beyond that of the personality or of the artist The dominant forces in the new rock of ages are not of course the intellectual leadership of the priestthe divinity of the constitutionVictorian sentimentor the Republican Partybut the intellectual leadership of clevernessthe divinity of cultsno sentimentand the Practical PlanThey are endorsed by the most promising element in modern lifethe young intellectuals who are working valiantly to create here what Europe has given to the arts and sciencesand working in the wrong directionOur inferiorities to the other civilizations they attribute to our puritanismour speedour economic evilsOhI get so sick of their failure to reach to the real causeIt is so silly to keep on insisting that we need poets like the French or philosophers like the Germans or musicians like the Russiansetc etc if we don t begin soon to understand why we haven t got themWe haven tThe Little Review Them becausein this curious countrywe haven t got people who feel Think of an Irish peasant walking under the stars I grant you that it also becomes silly to talk eternally offeelingwithout qualifying or definingIt is like taking refuge behind that vaguest phrase in the languagelife itself But byfeelingI mean simply that flight of wings which makes walking unnecessarythat dazzling tight rope performance which takes you safely over the chasm of Experience but leaves you as bruised as though you had fallen to its depthsFeeling is that quality of spirit which will save any artist from the philosophical redundancies of a De ProfundisThe torturing need of expressing something that far outstretches one s capacity for expression is the foundation of artThat s why we have so little of it in this countryThere may be some Americans in whom the perspective has retained its proper balanceI happen to know of one It is for some such need as this that THE LITTLE REVIEW existsto create some attitude which so far is absolutely alien to the American traditionI have been going to the lectures of John Cowper Powyswhich are spoken of in other places in this issueand that appreciative man gave me an interesting idea the other dayI should like to see him as editor of a literary magazine whose policy was to cut off the subscription list everybody who speculated about his pose or his insincerity and failed to miss the great beauty of his wordsNow M r Powys is as unstable as waterthat is his valueHe feels entirely too much ever to be fully saneHis hypothetical magazine would gather an audience that could fight successfully the great American crime which may be described briefly as missing the pointThus we might establish a reign of imagination which would make stupid things as impossible as cruel thingswhich would consider a failure to catch some new beauty or amoral lynching of great and independent spiritsas greater crimes than murdering a man in a dark corner On this basis we shall continueIf we must be sensible at least we shall make itin Shaw s phrasean ecstasy of common senseAnd out of all this chaos shall we produce our dancing star The supreme vice is shallownessWhatever is realized is rightOscar Wilde Before the scientific spirit can reach its full bloomit will have to acquire an honest sense of the role that fantasy plays in all its workThis is especially true of the social sciencesWe are just beginning to realize the importance in economics of the economist s UtopiaWe are learning the determining influence of the thinker s dream Walter LippmannPoems AMY LOWELL

grace thy feastingListen to the secret the white rose whispers to theeIt does not suffice that thou dost need thy lady or even that thy lady needs theeThou must prepare thyself for her even if she has

joythou criestWhat is DeathLove freed THE FOOL TO THE SOUL OF HIS LADYThe Jester said to himself If the body of my lady is so fair a tabernacle for her soulhow can Ia Foolunderstand the ways of her spiritMy lute and pipes can only render the voices of the windthe seathe trees and the cries of beasts in joy and painMy bells are a Jester s toys for assuaging the griefs of the children of menThe travailings of my lady s spiritlike the snow on the mountainsare out of reach of a fool s understandingFor one brief hour I heard a faint whisper in the halls of peace when my name was signed in the heavenly registersbutexcept in my heartI carried no trophy to earth by which I could tell men of the music I heard This is the birthday of my Ladythe festival which calls for prayer and joyPrayerbecause the paths of earth are hard for the feet of her whose tread awakens a longing for wings in the Fool standing nearJoybecause her eyes are mirrors of a time to come when love and peace will renew earth into heavenand men and women will become as wise as eagles and childrenThrough her bodyI love the soul of my ladyand through her soul I love her bodyNeither her soul nor her body may help and comfort the Jester even though God leads and helps him by both grace and mercyThough his heart be sore and his body sick unto death and there seems none to comfort himhe can still sing songs for men and pipe melodies for women of the wonders revealed to him The White Rosedying by the Jester s bedspoke once more to the Fool Cast self pity out of thine heartLearn to live as I have learned to dieand then learn to die as I have learned to liveFor thee absence seems deathbut trace the meaning of the soul of the woman thou lovestHer soul is also absent from the Oversold as her body is absent from a LoverOnly through absence can the Oversoul draw its own to itselfand only through loneliness can the Great Lover and the Lesser Lover understand one anotherWords confuse and touch enslavesSouls speak clearly in the silenceIn absence a note becomes a chordand in silence the chord becomes a symphonyThe discord dissolves into harmonyand the darkness into dawnThe absence of Death is not different from that of Lifefor Death is Lifeand Life the discord making Death s musicThe soul of thy Lady will find thine by the aid of both Life and Deathfor it is not God s Fool who hath declared that there is no Love nor a Creater thereofThou art learning that all is LoveIn thy prayers today for thy Lady s peace incline thy spirit towards hers as both approach the maternal source of the UniverseIt is the Mother Spirit of the world who has hidden thy love from thy sightand taken thine head from the touch of her hands and torn thy lips from her kissesIs it not always so that the mothers of the smaller world wean their children into growth and knowledgeThou art still hers even if her body is out of sight and touchfor pure love is the simple miracle of thine heritage as a son of man and of GodNothing can take from me what the sun made of me through his shiningEven as I die the fragrance remainsNothing can rob thee of the hours when all things seem possible because of thy hopes and her vowsLove is pain but over love is peaceTurn thy tears into help and pity for those who weep without thy hope and for those who dwell in dungeons and are not yet registered in heaven as wise or foolishLet thy longings for one break into prayer for the weal of the worldThou wert not sent here only for thy pleasure or thy peacenor was the body of thy Lady sent for thy delightor her soul for thy strength alonePain is ordained for the bringers of good tidings and love leant for the redemption of the many through the loneliness of the oneAccept thy lot and thy vision shall make thee freeResist thy fate and thy Love s soul and thine shall sleep embedded in flesh and with no power to grow wingsOn thy knees then and pray for strength and courage with thy cap and bells in readiness by thy sideand joy within thy heartAs I die thou must live The Jester took the rose in his handsandas its petals fella Fool s prayer broke the silence12 The Little ReviewMaker of men he cried pour into a fool s heart the understanding of life s joy and painMake my spirit at one with the great orderLet me understand what is required of me and in understanding be at peace As he prayedthe Jester sleptfor a great weariness was on him from much dancingIn his dreama little child ran towards himHe opened his Jester s cloakand the little one held the sleeves in her tiny hands Give all that thou hast and all that thou art even to one so small as I cried the child and ran from his sightThe Jester was awakened by the opening and clanging of a doorHe went out into the courtyardA beggarunshavedand swollen with dropsystood before himHe had evil eyes and a mouth twisted by painHe looked at the Jester and laughed Give me thy cap and bells he said I have need of them The Jester took money from his pouch Take all this instead he criedThe old man laughed Any lord or lady can throw me that he said if only to keep me from defiling them by my presenceGold costs less to give than to gatherIt is dross and could only help my body to live and sufferThy cap and bells would succour my spirit so that I could forget my bodyWith the jingle of them I could smile at the curses of the healthy or the jibes of the well washedGive them to meThou art well and happy and hast no need of help The Jester bowed his head and gave up his cap and bellsbut with sorrow and pain in his heartThe beggar ran away shaking the bells and dancing with gleethe Jester s cap all awry on his swollen headA sweet melting tenderness and faintness took hold of the Jester and an ecstasy swayed him so that he nearly fell It is the soul of my Lady speaking to mine he whispered What matter the cap and bellsLet them go The woman he loved stood by him and her voice was like a lute on the air as she grasped the Jester s shoulders Give all thy music to me she whispered I am in sore travail because of things a Fool cannot understandThy music ravishes me and makes me know that love is a consuming fire in which one burns gladlyThy wild notes make desire in me a quenchless thirst which no drinking can assuageThy soft piping fills my veins with a pain which is like joy and with a joy which is like painGive me allkeep nothing backI would see as thou seesthear as thou hearestdream as thou dreamestso that I can play as thoubut I must tune thy pipes to the voice of my heart The Jester drew his hood over his head and went to his cellHis Lady had no doubt as to what he would bring back to herfor she had learnt from him that love gives all things without question or regretThe Jester quite simply collected all the instruments he had made during the long years of his youth and his manhoodThey were precious to himfor he had not been able to buy as others because of his povertyHe had gone even to the offal of the slaughter housesand to the dank banks of the pondsand the waste places in hills and valleys for the things which gave his instruments such power over men with the strange cries he evokedThe Jester s sadness had been greater than even his povertybut the music had never failed to comfort and strengthen himVoices from the over world and under world spoke to himand the strange secrets he translated into soundThe Jester s heart was glad at lastHis Lady had need of him and of what he had madeHis music was hers as his heart was hersHe laid all his precious instruments at her feet and looked in her eyesThere were smiles for him thereShe bent as he knelt and took his headas of oldbetween her long cool handsand kissed his brow Happyhappy Fool she cried thus to be able to give allI will break hearts with the sweetness of these stringsI will bind others to me and know it is thy giftHappy FoolGoodbyeMay God comfort thee and me said the Jesteras he turned toward his cellTHE JESTER SLEEPSThe Jester is dead The words were said gravelyand the Lady who heard them looked keenly in an old man s face Dead she cried Yes Found dead this morningWe could not find his cap and bells nor the instruments he loved more than all other thingsThere seems no more music in the world nowfor we all grew happy through his music and the sunDeadshe whispered May I She hesitated Yescome The old man led the way He is thereWe found nothing by him but the leaves of a dead white rose and the wind from his window blew them on to his breastHe smiles said the LadyThere was silence in the cell except for the fierce howling of an April wind and the tiny fluttering of the leaves on the breast of the JesterThe Lady turned towards the doorHis instruments are at the gate she saidimpatiently Why did he dieI wonderThe reeds are no use to meI cannot play upon them not a sound will comeGreen Symphony JOHN GOULD FLETCHER I The glittering leaves of the rhododendrons and vibrate

spirit of French cultureso mistakentheir viewsand so curiously ignorant of the real facts of the developmentmodern French literature I am led to this reflection by reading Mr Shanks s excellent article inDecember numberIt is a most ungracious task to criticise a man whoabout to hazard his life in the service of his countryand I honor M rmore than I can expressBut i f I felt as M r Shanks does on theof French and German poetry I would not fight at all or I wouldfor GermanyTo a poet poetry must be the great business of life and for myselfI would emphatically support the Germans if I thoughtwere better poets than the French and English You will take thatstatement for what it is worthIntellectually about fifty per cent of English people are Germanized without knowing itI should say the percentage is even higher in AmericaI believe that no study is considered so frivolous or so suspect in both countries as the study of French art and poetryAnd yet Russia and one or two Anglo Saxons put aside the history of the art of the last fifty years is the history of French artYou who have given Whistler to the world do not need me to tell you what French art isThe American painting at a recent Exhibition here was of so high a quality that I felt my respect for the intellectual progress of America greatly increasedI admit freely and regretfully that it was immeasurely better than English paintingThat is because most Americans study painting in Paris Why don t they sometimes give a look at the poetry of Francefor in no country is poetry so cultivatedso well understoodand so honoredMr Shanks apparently knows something of German poetry and nothing of FrenchOf Liliencron I know nothingBut I do know something of HauptmannDehmeland Stefan Georg I have no doubt M r Shanks dislikes Georg because the latter got his training in France WellI will cheerfully wager that any more or less fair minded person would find three equally good poets in France to every one that can be mentioned in GermanyKahnRegnierand the other SymbolistesWhat an odd statementRegnier is a Parnassian and Kahn a nobodyI am not going to write a history of modern French poetrynor speculate as to the effect of 1870 or the probable effect of 1914 on poetryespecially French poetryI just want to give some namesand if anyoneif Mr Shankscan give me half as many German poets of the same calibrecharmand general technical accomplishment I shall be delighted Let us grant that RimbaudVerlaineand the elder Parnassians were products of the period of before 1870Wellsince that disastrous war France has produced the following I will not say great delightful and readable poets SamainFrancis JammesHenri de RégnierJean MoréasPaul FortLaurent TailhadeJules RomainsRemy de GourmontCharles VildracLaforgueLouystranslations Mallarmépre 1870 and younger men like Guy Charles CrosApollinaireCastiauxAndré SpireCarcoDivoireJouveLuc Durtainand dozens moreI do not mention the Belgians MaeterlinckVerhaerenElskampand Rodenbachnor the two Franco Americans Vielé Griffinand Merrill though they also have considerable reputations Did you ever hear of an American who wanted to write German I have quoted off hand twenty six names from a period of about forty yearsAnd you must remember that there are scores and scores of names only a little less knownand scores and scores beyond that which I may have missed in my readingBut I think those few names prove beyond all doubt and I would like people to read them and contrast them with German poets that French poetry is the foremost in our age for fertilityoriginalityand general poetic charmIt is not hatred of Germany but love of poetry which has called this letter from meI believe in France in the French traditionAnd if there is one thing which can reconcile me to this war it is the fact that England has ranged herself beside France and Belgiumbeside the cosmopolitegracefulhumanizinginfluences of France and French civilization against the nationalistnarrowand dehumanizing influences of BerlinI believe all Englishmen regret that they oppose the gaycultivatedcosmopolite Austrians it is a misfortuneBut of the great issue between the nations the great intellectual issue there can be no doubtAnd MrShankswhen he praisesunjustly I firmly believethe poets of Germany and disparagesequally unjustlythe poets of Franceis intellectually on the side of the enemy he is so courageously opposing with physical forceI believe in the kindliness of Germans I know them to be excellent fathers and most generous friends I know them to be brave soldiers and sailors I know they are good chemistsreasonably good doctorsand very boring professorsAt the name of Heine all men should doff their hatsbut that modern GermanyGermany since 1870has produced one fiftieth of the poetry that France has produced in quality as well as quantity that it has added anything to the purely creative side of the artsI utterly denyI know that there is NietzschePerhaps I will write you another letter on Nietzscheif I mayI feel that this protest will be put down towar fever I must refer you to my pre war articles in English periodicalsand to the testimony of my friends some of whom are now in America that such has always been my attitudeIt has always been a deep regret of mine that both American and English literaturecriticism and periodicals were so undermined with German influences that all gentlenessall intentional good willall that we mean by theLatin traditionwas anathemaand utterly despised The

17Chicago was given a vivid picture of the liberties allowed the peopleOn that occasion the freedom of assemblage and the right of free speech were ruthlessly and brutally denied a great host of people because forsooth they were poor and unemployedMen and women whose crime was that they could not find work had assembled at Hull HouseAfter the meetingit was suggested that a parade would impress their needs upon the cityImmediately they were attacked by the policesome of whom had been disguised in the tatters of unemployed men and scattered into the crowdYoung girls were beatenwomen were knocked downmen were assaultedand all in the name of lawThe assistant chief of policeHerman FSchuettlerdirected the official lawlessnessThis exponent of anarchy detailed fifty mounted police to charge the assemblage of hungry men and womenAnd here is the explanation given by Schuettler We expected something like this to happenWe had refused these people a permit and they took it upon themselves to violate the lawI have no fault to find with the conduct of the policemenOf course they may have been a bit rough but I am sure they acted within their rightsThey were obeying orders And thenpoltroon fashionthe anarchistic police attempted to conceal their stupid crimes and cruelties by stressing the fact that MrsLucy Parsonsone of the philosophical anarchists of Chicagowas a speaker at the Hull House meetingCould bureaurocracy go furtherThe episode is important because it is typical of what is going on all over the United StatesIt is a by product of our undigested industrial order and also a promise of what the future has in store for usit is the prophecy of a future feudalism which is rising like a flood and which will sweep us into impotency if we are not wise enough and strong enough to plan a sound reconstructionFrom San Diego to Portlandfrom Los Angeles to New Yorkthe fight is ragingIn places the people have definitely lost all the rights and privileges of a supposed democracyIn LeadSD in the Colorado coal fieldsin parts of Montanain parts of the Michigan copper countryin West Virginiain Pennsylvaniaand in Massachusettswhole sections of the population have been degraded by forces too strong for them to a condition of servilityA servile people is not a threat of the futureit is a comment upon the presentAnd among the servile peoplesthe liberties have perishedThe question which now remains is only Is the remnant strong enough or disciplined sufficiently to regain the fundamentals of freedom which slipped away while we slept It is not only the poor unemployed who have been battered about and made to cringePreachers and professors have also felt the stultifying constraint exercised by tired business men in moods of irritationHoward Crosby Warren gave an appallingly lengthy list of professors who have been discharged from universities all over the land within the last two or three years because they exercised the most commonplace latitude in the choice of their sentiments and their pronouncementsA Florida professor had to forego his position because he doubted the finality of the wisdom of the ante bellum teachers in the SouthA professor at Marietta CollegeOhiowas forced to resign because his political opinions were displeasing to his mastersA professor at Wesleyan was driven out on account of his opinion concerning the observance of the SabbathBut why go onThe number is tediously inclusiveSo great has this evil become among teachers that an association of University professors was organized in New York in early JanuaryFrom it college presidents and deans were expressly excludedThe members of the associationactuated no doubt by motives of middle class respectabilityannounced that they were not to be considered a trade unionbutfor all their dislike of the dignity of laborthey have found it necessary to fight as a body for the retention of the liberties essential to self respectThe attack on the Chicago unemployedwho made nothing like so much of a parade as the visitors to a ball park any summer afternoonnor so much of a street jam as the fashionable attendants at a Mary Garden operaillustrated the direction in which the attack is being madeThe real government of men is industrialand not politicalas every one knowsConsequently the genuine tyranniesor abuses of governmentcan be discovered naturally among the incidents of industryDrAnnie Marion MacLean of Adelphi CollegeBrooklynread a living document upon this phase of the question at a conference held by the economic and sociological associations at Princeton during Christmas weekIn the course of her investigationsays Paul UKellogg in his report of the meetings in The SurveyDrMacLean had been told by girls how their foremen had warned them against telling what their pay wasof loft building doors lockedof foul airand what notThe head of an employer s The Little Review Utopia had told her he would keep out unionism by making examples of the talk leadersHowBy firing themShe told of strikers suppressed by the police for what they saidwhile strikebreakers inside the factoryhurling insults at them from the windowswent unmolested Working women have the right to state the beliefs they hold without forfeit of their livelihood said she They need reassurance that liberty is more than a catch wordThe box makerthe bobbin girland the doffer have the right not only to life but to liberty and free speech in a land which is supposed to be the home of freedom Professors are denied the right of free speech because colleges and universities are organized on business principlesScholars and teachers are deprived of the franchise in all vital matters affecting university lifeThey are clerksTired business men are the masters of educationand tired business men have but one great principle loyalty to the organizationCriticism seems sacrilegeIncidentallythat accounts for the fact that the great inventions in business have been made by outsiders but that is not my storyThe same tired business men operating through the police take away the essential liberties from trade unionistsfrom the unemployedfrom socialistsand from the IWWs when the occasion arisesThe police acquire the habit of tyranny and then set to work to practice it on their own accountWhat reason under heaven could have persuaded Herman FSchuettler to order an attack on hungry men and womeninoffensivearmed only with banners bearing fragments of the Lord s PrayerSurely a Christian litany is not an incitement to riot Give us this day our daily breadif this be treasonwe may well pray for annihilation at the touch of some vagrant cometBut the police are pawns in the great game of the modern worldthe game of hide and seek for sovereigntyBlind and stupidthey do the occasional desires of their masters and thenfilled by a lust for repressiongo on to satiate their unwholesome appetitesHitherto I have assumed that the somewhat constitutional guaranties of free speech and free assemblage the two go hand in hand were actual rightsTheodore Schroederleader among the libertarianshas been prominent long among the small group which has ceaselessly stressed our fading freedomSchroeder has an article in The Forum in which he makes a witty attack upon Comstockery and upon the censorship which has grown up in the Post Office Department a censorship prudish and powerful enough to exclude the Chicago Vice Report from the mailsThis censorship of the imagined obscene is puerile and petty in sufficiency for any appetitebut it is useless to discuss it hereThe reaction is always more potent than the action where obscenity is chargedas witness our own September MornSchroederalbeitannounces his freedom of speech to bea natural and a constitutional right Societyso far as I knowrecognizes no natural rights and modern philosophy seems to sanction noneAs for constitutional rightsevery constitutionunless it be deadis subject to amendmentThe real foundation for the liberties of speech and assemblage is discovered in the social need for themWithout freedom the common weal withers and perishesThatthenis the basis and incidentally it affords a rod by which any attempt at censorshipby the policeby factory foremenby the post officeby university trusteesand even by a sluggish popular tastemay be measuredIf the powers of Olympus would lend to men some creature of infinite wisdom and tastesome creature versed in the weary evolutions of the pastand pregnant with the unformulated tendencies of the future through which an increasing happiness may be attained by menthen well might that creature assume a censorship of human thought and speechBut salvation cannot be won so lightlyfor the seed of happiness is with menNo one livesor has livedwith the power to say what idea was valuable to the world and what idea was banefulThe human substitutes which have been commissioned during the absence of this all wise and all prophetic authority have been uniformly dulllimitedand poisonous to the best hopes of the futureSincethenwe may not have a wise authoritywhy not frankly face the situationWe blame the policeand justlyfor their cruelties yet upon them American society has imposed an impossible taskWe have demanded free speech and free assemblage by our fundamental lawand privately we have told the police not to obey the constitutionWho s at faultNew York knowsLast winter at Madison Square Garden the same sort of folly was enacted as that which disgraced Chicago on SundayJanuary 17Then Arthur Woodspolice commissionersaw a great lightHe made an experiment in freedomIt worked hugely to his credit andparentheticallyto the descredit of some of those most noisy in demanding the rightThe emptiness of many of the speakers was exhibited and that was allThe existing order was unruffledAs a result of his enlightenment Commissioner Woods made a request at the conference on the old freedoms held at Princeton Policemen are entitled to definite orders said the commissioner People in this country have the constitutional right to freedom of assemblage and freedom of speechThe police have not only the responsibility to permit it but to protect them in its exerciseand the police should be so instructedThe police should be so instructed the welfare of the race demands itBut they won t get instructions until powerful organized groups of citizens find expressionUpon this organization rests the futureA Hymn to NatureThis fragmentaHymn to Nature unknown to us in the published works of

Orchestra in the fall of 1912Looking over the twenty two programs which he has given since then one is forced to admit that his tastes areto say the leastpeculiarThere have been frequent performances of Beethoven and Brahms and occasional classical programsTheseperhapsserve to keep his feet on solid earthbut at other times he soars into the realm of incomprehensible novelty and one can tell in advance where he will land just about as easily as if he were a German Zeppelin headed for ParisOne thing only seems certain he cannot resist the virtuoso that is in himhe gluts us with what can only be called virtuosity for its own sakeIf he offers a noveltyand when Brahms and Beethoven are taken care of he choosesfor the most partto offer little elseit is sure to be some outrageously difficult affair difficult both to play and to listen toOne cannot reasonably object to music merely because it is difficult to understandThe test is whether there is sufficient real beauty in it to repay careful and painstaking attentionAnd my point is simply that many of us feel that the beauty in SibeliusHolbrookeRegerLendvaiMraczekLoefflerMahlerSchmitt and others is disproportionately smallThe reasons for the New Yorker s peculiar bitterness against DrMuck are not difficult to discoverHe makes only ten appearances each season the Philharmonic and the New York Symphony each gives many more concertsFrom our point of viewwould it not be better if we relied on Stransky and Damroschthe merits of the one and the fripperies of the other are too apparent to call for comment herefor our first hearings of noveltiesThenif a particular composition seemed to warrant itthe Boston Orchestra could play it for us in its usual masterly mannerJust so long as New York worships the men from Boston in the mad feminine way it doesjust that long will it resent DrMuck s playing what it doesn t want to hearIt was Theodore ThomasI thinkwhodiscovering that people cared very little for Wagner s musicplayed it until they changed their mindsThat is all very well when you have a Wagnerbut I wonder just how heartily DrMuck admires the music he has recently served up to his New York audiencesTo begin with there was Sibelius s Fourth SymphonyNow Sibelius is one of the great living composersHe is a genuine musician by which I mean that you do not suffer all the agonies of stage fright when you hear a composition of his for the first timeHe knows the business of his craft and you usually feel safe in his handsthanks to three Symphonies and FinlandiaBut how rudely this fourth symphony shakes your confidenceCall it musicianly show how consistently planned and executed it is you won t like it any the moreTo be sureSibelius is a Finn and an intensely feeling oneHe gives expression to the emotions of that curiously unhappy raceBut music to appeal must be more universal than this angry symphony of ugly moodsYou can t explain it on cubist grounds unless the Finns also call it disagreeableBut one ventures the guess that theyperchancefind it richly agreeablein which case its performance shouldby International lawor what is left of itbe confined to FinlandThen there was

orchestraplus the detailed analysis of his work furnished by the composerexplains SchlemihlIt is an attempt to out Richard Richard Straussandlike almost all such attemptsit failsReznicek recounts the life and fate of a modern man pursued by misfortune who goes to destruction in the conflict between his ideal and his material existenceA compound essentially of Tod und VerklarungTyll Eulenspiegel and Ein Heldenlebenbut at no time reaching the heights attained by Strauss in all three of these tone poemsImitators somehow almost always fall down in two ways they devote far too little attention to what they want to say and far too much to their manner of saying itAnd as an not unnatural result of thisthey forgetor appear to forget at any ratethat melody is the prime essential in great musicWagner had melodic geniusas we all realize todayand that Strauss has it is no longer open to very serious questioningReznicek hasn tHis music is all rather goodbut none of it good enough to grip you as the finest music doesIt has no great moments but only moments of very great soundThe house fairly quaked at some of the fortissimosAnd yet Schlemihl would be pleasant enough were it not so pretentiously bombastic and did it not last twice too longBut the mere existence of Ein HeldenlebenTyll Eulenspiegel and Tod und Verklärung deprives Schlemihl of any greater claim than thatAfter these two pieces Scheinpflug s Overture to a Comedy of Shakespeare proved quite simple and enjoyableIt is a musicianly piece of work lacking neither in melodic invention nor in skilful orchestrationThe Allegretto Graziosain which an old English tune from the Fitz William Virginal Book is introducedis wholly delightfulAnd having said that muchone really has said allThe overture can have no possible chance of immortality it is not great musicit is not intensely interesting or unusually delectable one feels rather that such compositions as this are the by products of the daily practice of the art of music by men of no little talent but very little geniusAs suchthey demand an occasional hearingtoday Scheinpflug has the stagetomorrow someone else what matter whosince none are really mastersAn occasional performance of Strauss s early Symphonic SuiteAus Italienis probably quite justifiable because of his imposing importance among the composers of todayWhen a musician attains greatness almost everything he ever wrote becomes of interest to his disciplesAus Italien calls for little commentFirst performed in 1887it is difficult today to realize the great uproar and rage it evokedNow it seems quite tameIt was indeed Strauss sfirst step towards independence and it is interesting as the connecting link between his very early work and Don Juan and its successorsIts first movementOn The Campagnais probably the most successfulreaching as it does gravely grey and tragic heightsA sense of oppressiveness fairly overwhelms the listener and there are chords that are exquisite Amid Rome s Ruinsis not nearly so sustained and well knitThe opening of the third movement On the Shore of Sorrento depicts with wonderful effectiveness the brilliance of an Italian sea under a dazzling sun a brilliance that no one who has seen it is likely ever to forgetStraussfor all his reputed blare and noisehandles his orchestra pianissimo in a manner immeasurably more impressive than anyone else of his time The opening bars of Tod und Verklärung and the love scene in Don Juan immediately come to mind And you can measure a generation s progress in orchestration by the unruffled placidity with which people 38 The Little Review nowadays listen to the at one timebrillianttumultuousaudaciousunusualand boldfinaleNeapolitan Folk Life Even the casual concert goer must notice the amazing duplications that are being offered this seasonFor two or three seasons a particular composition is neglectedthen suddenly it is played five times in half as many weeksStransky plays Don Juana week later Muckas it wereshows us how it ought to be playedThe Symphony Society plays Brahms s Second Symphony and shortly thereafter Muck administers his reproach to DamroschIs there any reason why conductors shouldn t meet occasionally and plan to avoid such waysMuck appears the chief offenderHis program stated that he was playing Ropartz s Fourth Symphony for the first time in New Yorkbut Stransky had played it only eight days earlierWhen will we hear it againFor this Symphony deserves another hearingThe only work by a Frenchman that DrMuck has offered this seasonit is far more satisfying than any of his other noveltiesThe restless swing of the opening theme grips you at once and your curiosity is piqued as the violins sing against theKernelin the hornsThe Adagio is not so successful the theme sung by the English horn is not sufficiently melodiousYou need only compare it with the heart breaking Largo of Dvorak s Aus Der Neuen WeltBut there are the most engaging rhythms many of them typically Scotch in their snapIn fact did Ropartz s gift for melodyit is far from negligibleapproach his rhythmic talenthe might produce really great musicAs it isthis Fourth Symphony interests and gratifiesBut it is too longIts three movements are played without a pause and one s attention flags at timesIt seems likely that this is inevitable in absolute music only a program can really hold one s attention for almost forty minutesStrauss does it in Ein Heldenlebenbut Don JuanTyll Eulenspiegel and Tod und Verkldrung last only about twenty minutes eachdespite the fascinating explanations that the program notes always give of their musical contentsRopartz s Fourth Symphony would be much better if played with pausesand the sections are so clearly indicated that this could be done without great difficultyButon the wholea hearing of his work makes one wish for more French musicwith its charmingclear cut rhythms so typical of the Gaul To my mind Ropartz s indebtedness to César Franck is a matter of comparative unimportanceDisciple or nothe has brought to his task of writing music freshness and charma fund of melody and a quite adequate technique After listening to

attack upon manupon his will to liveOn this accounthe has a right to protect himself from sufferingto hold suffering far from himBut the struggle seems futileThe host of sufferings seems illimitableFor each old suffering which we thought we had vanquishedten new ones come of which we had never dreamtIndeedthe capacity to suffer grows with the growth of manThe feeling of pain grows as the senses become sharper and finerThe higher a man s developmentthe stronger becomes his ability to feel life s painsEven if we could exchange all the sufferings of life for pure joy and blissthis latter life would be suffering stilla surfeit and a searchand I doubt not we would long for an hour of some old anguish again that would redeem us from a pleasure now grown oppressive and intolerableShall wethenhate lifeShall we say that it were better not to be than to beWe mightdid we not find strength and comfort in and with every sufferingdid we not allow every item or event of experience the democratic right to a trial by a jury of its peers and to our trust that it is worth while until it shall prove that it is notdid we not experience that up from the abyss of every sufferingpainful as it seemsa path leads to a summit where all sufferings are only shadows of a blinding flood and fullness of lightthat all articulate and fit into the eternal process of an upward striving lifeThere is no question but that this is the workable view of life to present to the heart of mandrainingas one mustpain s bitter cup for one s selfBut the sufferings one feels for otherssufferings in which one s loveexpressed in sympathy and pityis complicated this is another matterhere one may fall into mischievous aberationThere can be no doubt that the pain of our pity for others may be more painful than the pain of our own livesIn the throes of such pitythe woes of our own lives may seem small indeedand finally fade awayTo behold a human being that is deeply dear to us suffer is worse than it would be to suffer in his placeAnd if the man of moral elevation of soul feels equal in the end to all that brings pain to his own lifeall the more defenseless does he feel with regard to the great all prevailing misery whichin pitycelebrates its triumphal entry into his heartLove is our noblest human powerand it is love that lets us feel such miseryit is love whose wealth of recognition and experience renders it possible for us to descry sorrow s abyssesto anticipate them even in advance of the poor sufferer himselfNowmay love be goodand pity bad What a problem is here May we war a two fold warfareone against suffering and one against pityOught weWar upon pity would not that be in contradiction to all that our own generation especially calls good and greatOur generation has done its best to develop in the human heart an ever enlarging capacity for pity what would it say to a warrior who pitilessly took up arms against pityFriedrich Nietzsche was such a warriorsingle handed and alone And the venomous verbal onslaught upon Nietzsche by those who did not understand him was equalled only by those who didAt first Nietzsche s own success consisted in supplying his opponents with new weapons against himselfOf all the words which have been used as bludgeons to break the head of this most resolute rebel against our previous moral view of lifeNietzsche s piercing words concerning pity and the pitiful have most occupied the attention of his enemiesThis may not deter us from looking unabashed the great question squarely in the faceIn the endis pity something to be overcomea disease of the old cultureDoes the path of the new culture lead men out and beyond and above pityThis is no longer a Nietzsche question merelyThis is a question of the moral life of our timePerhaps this is the last weightiest question which our time can put to men of dignity and depth of thoughtHoweverit is only fair to say at the outset that no one has any right to fly into a rage at Nietzsche in particular for summoning men to arms against pitysinceif rage is in order at allthe conventional practices of our previous life furnished therefor occasion enoughAyethere is an old wide spread fashion of averting the strain of pity which is so mean and cool that almost anybody could fly into a frenzy over it the fashionnot of triumphing over pitybut of cowardly flight from pityConsider the whole conception of life of the so called favorites of fortuneTo what lengths do they go that they may be spared the sight of misfortunethat they may not be agitated by a touch of pity How they avoidif at all possibleevery place that would remind them that there are want and miseryhunger and sorrowin the world as the Parisians diduntil Zolathe most calumniated author of the nineteenth centurydragged these thingswith their ensuing vicesout into the light of day and made the French people look at themHow furious they areas the French were at great Zolaat anybody who dares to open their eyes to the sad and harrowing realities of life Naythey have invented a special art and religion that shall succeed in sparing them pitythe former to conjure up a make believe world in which life shall be all sunshine and gladnessthe latter to advocate the doctrine that all pain is punishment from Godand thatsince God must be justHe will properly parcel out and administer pain and sufferingWe do not need to bestir ourselves in behalf of sufferersthat would be a wrong against Goda doubt of the Everlasting Justicehence all may not feel pity for the wicked man upon whom God visits His wrath and punishmentThus thegood peopleand the just harden their heartsThey have stones which they heave at the poor sinner especially at asinful womanbut no mercyno pityfor those who are not as they areand do not think and feel and act as they doThey grow chesty Yesif others were as good as we arethen it would be as well with them as it is with us With such pride they choke all feeling of kinship and connection with othersWhere pride growsno pity can thriveAnd at last pity itself becomes a kind of pridea sorry self reflection as in a mirrorThe most subtle and dangerous way for men to free themselves from the pain of pitywhen they cannot stave it off completelyis to make it a thing of pride and praise I thank TheeGodthat I am not like the hard hearted Then they revel and riot in their pitythen they rejoice that they are so good heartedso tender heartedbecause they can see no suffering without being touched and melted to tearsAnd the pitiful call this their morality and their virtueThey make adelicacyof their pity to set before themselves at the table of life when all of life s other gratifications and indulgences begin to grow stale and tastelessThe tears of emotion that gush generously forth at the spectacle of suffering humanity even of frail and faulty humanity taste so good Many is the time they have felt the weary weight of this unintelligible world on listening to a sad story or seeing a playand screwed up melancholy and doleful countenances maybe pity can be put among the things that can make lifealways requiring to be braced up a bita trifle more interestingAnd so pity is at last honored with a place among the articles of luxury with which they enrich and adorn their lives their livesalways surprising them with some fresh sign of poverty and patches But if all guilt be revenged upon earthpunishment of this misuse of pity may not be stayedIt is doubly punished and revenged upon him who practices it and upon him upon whom it is practicedOr do we not know that the pharisees of pity become ever more feeble and sentimental menlosing all power and energy of will through pure emotionalityOr do we not know that most crafty business speculationspeculation in pityin which sufferers magnify their least painsexpert in making an impression with theircasesin order to arouse the interest of the pitifulan interest which need not always be relieved by the clink of coinbut which makes ready its punishment much more frequently with idle hours spent in dreaming and weepingwith the unprofitable breathing out of pathos and reproachOften enough the enthusiasts of the kind and tender heart do not know what they dobut they rob men of the marrow of lifethey emasculate and coddle the soul and the emotional debauchery in which they liverequires ever stronger stimulus which ever operates more enervatingly stillContemplating these devastations wrought everywhere in life by love s softnessone begins to cherish some respect for a Nietzsche who preached to mena hard bed love s hardnessTo be sureif one is to understand this preachingone must keep in mind what the preacher says My brethrengive heed unto each hourin which your spirit wisheth to speak in parables there is the origin of your virtue Nietzsche speaks in parablesFor instancehis words on war and warriors a good war hallowing every cause thesetooare parablesAnd hardnessbraverypraised by him as the strength and consecration of lifetruly this is not the barbarity of prize fighting or the brutality of lynchingthis is the high mind fearlessly going its own waystampeded by no danger into thinking and acting and being other than what it holds to be rightDanger is but the acid test which such a mind applies to the ingredients of its lifeTo such a mindhardness is the characteristic of the gemof the diamondwhich thus guarantees its genuinenessits sparkling worthZarathustra Nietzsche loves everything which steels the will and augments life s forceTherefore he loves his foeforthanks to his foehe never comes to a standstill and stagnatesTherefore his true friend is the one who has become his best foewho makes him sweatwho summons him to risk hot war with himto break a lance with him in an intellectual passage at arms in which the soul struggles for its own yea and naySosimilarlythis Zarathustra Nietzsche hates pityWhyNot because he is a brute Kind unto the sick is ZarathustraWould that they were convalescent and conquering and creating a higher body for themselvesNot becauseas we have seenso much of pity is for self s sake and not for the sake of servicethough this is an essential part of the answerThen whyBecause it works an embarrassment for manbecause it knows no shameno reverencein the presence of the giant forces whichfor every brave soulis concealed in great and deep painTherefore he combats pity because it is a passion and not an actionand yet life is not for passionists but for pragmatists All great love is lifted above all its pityfor it seeketh to create what it lovethBut all creators are hardIf thou hast a suffering friendbe a couch for his sufferingbut a hard bedas it werea field bed thus thou wilt be of most use for him Hearken yeO Readerto another Transvaluer of values Whose Person Nietzschethe Crucified excoriated at ill starred momentsbut did so on the basis of that veryhigh mindfor which Herejecting pitywent to His CrucifixionAnd JesusPilate handed over to their willAs they led him off he was followed by a large multitude of the people and also of women who beat their breasts and lamented himbut Jesus turned to them and said Daughters of Jerusalemweep not for meNowas it seems to methis Nietzsche preaching is not so far removed from that other preaching which we are otherwise wont to call a gospela gooda glad message For this glad message was not a lamentationbut a hymn of heroism and of victorya call to creation And I take the liberty to repeat that the Preacher of this glad message forbade pity for himself even in his dark and desolate hour do you think what that hour waswhen he appealed to weak and wailing and weeping womanly soulsWeep not for meweep for yourselves And He Who Himself wills no pityWho bears in Himself a greatness which is elevated above all pitywould he have willed to have men so weak and pitiful as we often enough today imagine the Ideal of a Christ man to beWhatnowif the true pitiful lovethe true mercy to menwere to harden themto make them free from what meant only suffering to themIt isto be surevery much more difficult to make men themselveshard so that the burden lying on their backs can not crush them than it is to indulge their weakness and sensitiveness and to leave them as they areIndulgent parental hearts would a thousand times rather remove all life s burdens from their children than to place burdens upon their children which they might learn to bearSo often our pity plays us a sorry trick we would rather do something for men than to repress our pitysilence itand then teach men how they themselves can do what is good and necessary for themWe speak of a ministrant lovemeaning a love which knows nothing higher than to provide comfortsavert trialsspare vexationsand everything which could shake a man to his foundationsHow much greater a service of love it would be to lead man to himselfmake him strong that he might be equal to what we had thought we must take away from him Praynot for easier taskslighter burdensbut for more power This Nietzschean love is not only a greater loveit also requires a greatermore tiresome workit requires a constant conquest of our pitying weaknessit requires a courageous faith in man and a firm earnest appraisal of his powerAnd how entirely different a service of friendship do we render a friend if we show a hard love to himif he break a tooth on usas Nietzsche saysbecause we do not flatter and fit himbut compel himout of love compel himto assert himself against usand to withstand our defense of our rights against him Foolish men seek their friends among the Jasagernmost preferablyamong those who are of their own opinion in everythingThey then call this an ideal friendship two souls and one thoughttwo hearts and one beatBut in such a friendshiptheir besttheir own soultheir sense of truthand their courage for the truthsoon rustsTo spare a friend the disillusion which he would suffer if he felt an antagonisman oppositionin the friendshipthey have pity on himthey learn to keep silentand silence soon becomes a lieSince they dare not cause the friend the grief of discovering to him these liesthey lie morelie life longall out of pityout of their weak tender loveHow much nobler and greater that friendship whose ideal Nietzsche sketches for usin which we are gripped from the outset in a friend s contradiction and hostility We seek and love in him precisely what is not attuned to usbut is his ownand must forever remain his very ownSuch hard love which gives the friend acamp bedand not one assoft as downy pillows areand requires the like in return is the proudest manliest friendshipis alone what brings our sluggish and pampered natures forwardand makes us strongerfreerricher in understanding and experienceEvery genuine love should be a spurfreedomto usnot an easy berth and a trammel in lifeWe cannotwe ought notrefrain from pity in lifeWe cannotwe ought notstave it artificially from usPity belongs to man as manIt comes stealing upon himand ought so to comeBut when it has comehe ought not to be enmeshed in itStill less ought he to let it grow rankHe should ennoble itovercome itwith strong will and energetic deedFor pity is yet suffering and all suffering summons men to conflictto defenseThe sign that such overcoming has succeeded is that rejoicing together has been born of suffering together is that the conflict has issued in a victory in which hard militant love triumphs over every weaknessand is grateful to the hardness which has given it such a victory In his brilliant book on Nietzsche Who Is to Be Master of the World Ludovici writes powerfully as followsWhat the units of a herd most earnestly seek and findis smug easenot necessarily mastershipFor mastership entails responsibilityinsightnervecourage and hardness towards one s selfthat control of one s self which all good commanders must haveand which is the very antithesis of the gregarious man s attitude towards himselfHardnessHe knows nothing of the hardness that can command his hearthis mouthbefore it attends to the command of others he knows nothing of the hardness that can dispel the doubts of a whole continentthat can lead the rabble and the ruck to deeds of anomalous nobilityor that can impose silence upon the overweening importunities of an assembled nationHe knows this hardnessthat he could coldly watch the enemy of his private and insignificant little interestsburnt at the stakehe knows this hardnessthat he would let a great national plan miscarry for the sake of a mess of pottagethe gregarious man and future socialist has this so called hardness but so have all those who burn with resentmentso have all parasites and silent worm gnawers at the frame work of great architecture But not Nietzsche s interpreterbut Nietzsche himselfshall have the last wordPraises are what maketh hard I do not praise the land where butter and honey flowTo learn to look away from one s self is necessary in order to see many things this hardener is needed by every mountain climber Also Sprach Aristoteles ZarathustraGeorge Middleton s One Act Plays CLAYTON HAMILTON The one act play is an art form that is worthy of careful cultivationIt shows the same relation to the full length drama as the short story shows to the novelIt makes a virtue of economy of meansIt aims to produce a single dramatic effect with the greatest economy of means that is consistent with the utmost emphasisA one act playin exhibiting the presentshould imply the past and intimate the futureThe author has no leisure for laborious expositionbut his mere projection of a single situation should sum up in itself the accumulated results of many antecedent causesThe one act playat its bestcan no more serve as a single act of a longer drama than the short story can serve as a single chapter of a novelThe form is completeconciseand self sustainingand it requires an extraordinary focus of imagination46 The Little Review No other American dramatist has so carefully cultivated this special type of drama as George MiddletonHis recently published volume of one act playsentitled Possessionwas preceded by two other volumescalled Embers and TraditionEach of these books contains half a dozen playsFrom the fact that MrMiddleton has chosen to publish these eighteen one act plays in advance of their productionit is not to be inferred that he is a believer in the closet dramaA closet drama may be defined as a play thatbeing unfit for production in the theatreis fit only to be locked up in a closetMrMiddleton is not a literary amateurbut a professional and practical playwrightHe has produced more than half a dozen full length plays in the commercial theatre and such artists as Julia MarloweMargaret AnglinGeorge Fawcettand the late EMHolland have appeared in dramas of his compositionAll of MrMiddleton s one act plays are written for the stage and to quote from his own preface to Possession he conceivesthe value of play publication not as a substitute for production but as an alternative for those whose dramas may offer little attraction to the manager because of theme or treatment At present there isunfortunatelyscarcely any market in the American theatre for one act plays that take life seriouslyIt is against our custom to provide a full length drama with a curtain raiser or an after pieceand the field for one act plays in vaudeville is restricted to slap stick comedies and yelling melodramasIt is for this reason that MrMiddleton has been required to choose publication as an alternative for productionin the case of these diminutive dramasThe trouble is not at all that his pieces are unsuited to the stage they are admirable in techniqueand like all good plays they would be more interesting in the theatre than in the libraryThe trouble is only that for wholly artificial and accidental reasons the commercial theatre in America at present is inhospitable to the one act playMrMiddleton s one act plays reveal a wide range of subject matter and a corresponding versatility of treatmentNo one of them is similar to any of the othersYetpervading this variety of subject and of moodthere is discernible an underlying unityEach of them deals essentially with woman and with modern woman in relation to our modern social systemWoman isat presenta transitional creatureevolving from the thing that man considered her to be in the far away period of wax flowers and horse hair furniture to the being that she considers herself about to become in the unachievedpotential future and MrMiddleton has caught her in this period of transitionand has depicted herunder many different lightscolored with her virtues and discolored with her faultsMany of the most poignant and dramatic problems of present day society arise from the fact that the evolution of woman is proceeding more rapidly than the evolution of her environmentWhile individuals advancetraditions lingerMrMiddleton s favorite subject seems to be a conflict between an advanced woman and a lingering traditionThe author is himself a radicaland his sympathy is forever on the side of the revolutionary individualbut his technical treatment is so fair to both sides of the contention that it remains possible for conservative readers to rank themselves against the individual on the side of the lingering traditionScarcely any of MrMiddleton s women would be pleasant to have around the houseSince most of them are discontented with the conditions of their livesthey naturally make the worst of these conditions instead of making the best of themHell hath no fury like a woman in revolt and many readers may dislike MrMiddleton s heroines more heartily than he seems to like them himselfBut to be able to dislike a character is a proof that that character is realand must be considered as a tribute to the author s artThe heroine of The Unbornin MrMiddleton s latest volumerefuses to have children because motherhood might interfere withher work the workin this casebeing merely a habit of attending to minor matters in her husband s photographic studio but the intensity of impatience with which the reader listens to her twaddle is an indication that this character is really representative of a silly type of creature that is not infrequently encountered in actual lifeAgainin the play called Possessiona woman who has been divorced for adultery attempts to kidnap her little daughter from the house of her former husbandto whose custody the child hadof coursebeen awarded by the courtsHer adultery was inexcusablebecause it had been occasioned not by an irresistible and overwhelming love but merely by a superfluity of leisure and her attempt to kidnap the child was treacherous and ignominiousShe excuses herselfhoweverby telling her husband that the process of child birth had been painfuland thatthereforedespite the judgment of the courtstheir little daughter belonged more to her than to himThe reader isof courseannoyed by all this nonsense but this annoyanceonce againmust be regarded as a tribute to the reality of the author s characterizationNo heroine who was not a living human being could make the auditor so ardently desire to climb upon the stage and talk back to herFortunatelyit is not at all necessary to like MrMiddleton s women in order to like his playsOne may admire Ibsen s Hedda Gabler without wishing to be married to the heroine and the pleasant thing about MrMiddleton s women is thatwhile the reader is permitted to observe and study themhe is also allowed to realize with hearty thankfulness that he will never have to live with any of themThe world in which his women move is a world of discontentThis discontent is truly representative of the present transitional period in the evolution of societybut it is not representative of that perennial reality of life

be difficult to imagine a more fantastic occasion than a debate in New York on the justice of the cause of the Allies vsthat of Germany between Cecil Chesterton and George Sylvester ViereckThe gods

called hisswan song with the announcement that as this commercial age was unappreciative of his poetry he would write no moreand anyone who wanted a last chance to value him at it must buy this bookFor himselfhe was going to get in line with the genius of the century and become a Big Business Manfor he must make himself feltHe announced in a stentorian wail his admiration for Theodore Rooseveltand was much chagrined when that celebrity would not let him trail along on the skirts of his ample publicityLater onwhen Alfred Noyes began to sell in large quantitiesMrViereck resumed his dictatorship of poetryand by scurrilous attacks attempted to draw MrNoyes s fire and newspaper spaceNow German Patriotism has lifted him to the headlinesIf Poetic Justice was present at the debateshe probably did not receive much enlightenment on the questions which are now vexing her in EuropeTo quote any of the substance of the debate would be an insult to her intelligenceA more serious event was Richard Bennet s recent production of Brieux s MaternityConsidering the deadly earnestness with which author and cast struggled to inculcate lessonsthe apathy of the public in respect to moral instruction was patheticOn the night of my visit there was exactly one normaltheatre goerin the houseThere was a sprinkling of people who had long admitted what Brieux has to sayand went fromhigh browreasonsThere was a young society matron who had escaped from her husband for the evening and is taking an amateurish interest in social questionsThere were numerous persons who are always on the lookout for a chance to cackle at what they consider broad humorThese blonde ladies furnished an interesting refutation of one of Brieux s theoriesIn one scene various women tell their troublesemphasizing the fact that all women are united in their sorrows and understand themwhereas men do notImmediately after this the drunken husband returns and disgusts and outrages the wifeThere were many laughs in the audience to greet him but not one from a manEven the blonde ladiesfat escorts tried to quiet them while the rest of us were hissingGranville Barker opens this week with Androcles and the Lion and some of the other recent London productionsA number of the backers of the oldNew Theatreare guaranteeing his expensesa fact which is a historical corroboration for MrBarker

don t make themit will cost you three million he repliedand sailed back to LondonHis popularity with the New Theatre guarantors has been steadily increasing from that day to thisThere is even a rumor that if the present experiment succeedsthe New Theatre project will be resumedThis whisper aroused an answering howl from the American managers and actorsWhy should good American money be spent in

competition can be to our present shoddy productsthe betterThis ironic year has produced few more strange reversals than the one which has brought MrMcClure to the status of an employee of MrMunseyWhen a man has apparently won his life campaign and written so engagingly of it as has MrMcClure in his Autobiographywe begin to regard him as beyond the touch of the fatesPerhaps the present eventuality should be takenhowevermerely as another proof that in our present arrangement of things it is less profitable to have a touch of genius than to become the owner of trust companiesAt any rate McClure s Magazine has apparently not profited much in recent years by MrMcClure s separation from its editorial policyThere is one real consolation in a season which has brought such material

to this humble and powerful procedure Women can always and everywhere ennoble the feelingsrefine an idea of justiceand sharpen the judgment of those who come under their influenceThe indirect result of this influence will then be that war will become more and more insufferable to the feelingsrepugnant to the sense of justiceand absurd to the intelligenceWhen thus the eyes of the best among the

SCHUCHERTTwo Conrad Reviews Joseph ConradA StudyRichard Curie DoubledayPage and CompanyNew YorkThe business of criticism says MrCurie is to surmount this impasse between conviction and the power to convince Judged by this testhis study of Joseph Conrad is undoubtedly successfulit is hard indeed to imagine any reader reaching the end of it without believing that Conrad is a very great writerA careful reading of the numerous and often lengthy quotations from Conrad s books should alone convince the persons MrCurie is most anxious to convert those who know nothing about themBut Joseph Conrad has two obvious faultsIn the first placeMrCurie is quite too modest almost haltingly soHis pages abound in such phrases asI dare sayI cannot helpI think and the likeThat s all very honestbut Americans prefer the more lordly mannerOne feels reallythat while the critic may speak in such fashion to himselfhe should give us only his conclusions and no apologies for them to bootIn the second placeMrCurie seems to think that he is very brave in putting forth this bookthat the critics haven t appreciated Conrad at alland that since he does there must be a real quarrel between him and themNow as a matter of fact this is not soProbably no living writer has had a fraction of the hearty recognition from the best critics that Conrad hasTruehe hasuntil six months agowoefully lacked anything like popularity and the material rewards it brings but very few of those whose opinion carries weight will hesitate to agree with most of the fine things that MrCurie says about the author of ChanceMrCurie s attitude simply arouses unfriendly antagonism on the part of his readers who know and love their ConradSo much for its faultsThey are not of serious importance and should not obscure the really splendid qualities of MrCurie s bookIt abounds in acutely perceptive remarks often extremely well putIn the course of seven chapters on Conrad s PsychologyMenWomenIrony and Sardonic HumourProse and the Artisthe piles up an overwhelming evidence of the man s greatnessIs there a man alivehas any English novelist ever lived about whom one could wax so easilyso madly enthusiasticTrueto some Conrad does not appealThey have never caught the glorious glamour of his pages the solemn grandeur of his magnificent proseProbably the surest way to win converts would be to compile a small book of extracts from his workscarefully graded according to their difficultyWhen I was still at college I was curious about ConradA well meaning bookseller sold me Lord JimI tried to read itbut fifty pages was as far as I could goI tried againbut with even less successThen one day at Interlaken I found a Tauchnitz copy of A Set of SixBefore I had quite finished the last story I lost the book changing trainsBut Conrad has never since seemed obscure to meA beginner in French would never try to appreciate the shimmering pages of Flaubert nor would even the Yankee farm hand feed his baby pieMore than any living writer has Conrad needed some one to present him to the publicThis his American publishers have tried of late to doMrCurie s book will add to their success in so far as they manage to persuade people to read itExcept for those who have begun with Lord JimNostromoor ChanceI have never found anyonewhohaving read one book by Conradwas content to stop thereMrCurie thinks Nostromo Conrad s greatest workIt is nowwith Europe in the throes of a bloody conflictthat one realizes more and more how Conrad s men and womenfar removed from the problems of a Wellsa Chestertonor a Shaw problems which appear suddenly to be of very little importance after all bulk great and ever greaterThere they loom like Rodin s Balzac against the glowering skyALFRED KNOPFA Set of Sixby Joseph Conrad DoubledayPage and New YorkIn this first American edition of his Set of SixConrad is revealed as an artist par excellenceYou find no subjective emotionalism on the part of the author in any of his six talesin spite of their subtitles RomanticIndignantPatheticand the likeYou see in him the wistful observer of characters and situationswhich he presents with impassionate objectivitywith the impartiality of a painter who lovingly draws his objectwhether it is ugly or beautifulwhether it is a villain or a saintConrad possesses a wonderful skill in setting up a backgroundwhichat timesappears of more importance than the plotHe makes you feel equally at home in the atmosphere of Napoleonic France and of France of the Restorationof revolutionary Peru and of a Neapolitan amusement gardenYou enjoy the tales greatlyyou admire the clever craftmanship of the story tellerbut you close the book with an empty feelingas if you had listened to brilliant anecdotes in a bachelorsclubKAmy Lowell s Poetry Sword Blades and Poppy Seedby Amy Lowell The Macmillan CompanyNew York In one of his lettersByron saysTo withdraw myself from myself has ever been my solemy entiremy sincere motive in scribbling at all Such a confession seems strange coming from a poetand it is a confession of quite a different character which is written on every page of Miss Lowell s book of poemsThere one finds in every line the expression of a personality which tries to realize itself and succeeds in doing soThe unity as well as the interest of the book is in this very development of a strong personalityof which a new and original aspect is revealed in every poemWhat charms us at once in this personalityand renders the reading of the book a constant enchantmentis a most wonderful imagination an imagination at the same time creative and representativerichvariedoverflowing with images and themesAll that life and nature offer is the domain of this imaginationit wakes up at the most unexpected moment and seizes the unseen detailgiving us an idea of the wonderful wanderings through which it must take the person fortunate enough to possess itNow it is a temple now a church now a beggar a blue scarf the distant notes of a flute or the nocturnal noises of a London streetwhich starts it on its wayAt other times we find the imagination at play with itselfso to speakcreating out of nothing a historical or legendary atmosphereor opening a philosophical vistaas in The Great Adventure of Max BreuckThe Basketor the poem from which the book takes its nameEach one of these poemsand several others alsohas its own special atmosphereprecise in its complexity and different from all the othersIn the style itselfin the development of the subjectsone finds the same qualityIt seems as if the pen were too slow to note the multiple images which offer themselves to the mind of the poetThey accumulate themselvessometimesin a manner not unlike that of Victor Hugoforming long periods in which the idea is turned in all possible wayspresented from all angles and in every natural or artificial lightIt is not only the richness of the imagesbut their qualitywhich reveals the power of Miss Lowell s imaginationWe all experience at every minute of our lives an infinity of sensations of which we are more or less consciousIt might almost be said that we are poets in exactly the measure that we realize and enjoy our sensationsThe real poet not only registers his sensationsbut is able to awaken in the mind of his readers the sudden recollection of those visual or auditive impressions which have never before reached his consciousnessThis is what often delights us in Sword Blades and Poppy SeedIt gratifies us to feel that we are able to understand these subtle comparisonsthese curious and unexpected alliances of wordssuch as those in the first poem of the bookwhereto define certain shades of porcelains the poet speaks Of lustres with so evanescent a sheen Their colours are feltbut never seenAlso in the first poem entitled Miscastwhere she speaks of her mind as So keenthat it nicks off the floating fringes of passers bySo sharpthat the air would turn its edge Were it to be twisted in flightTo help her imaginationMiss Lowell possesses a faculty which belongs only to the happy fewthe gift of wordsThe astonishing description of arms and vases in the first poem is but one exampleif one of the bestof this rare giftIt is necessary alsoin order to study thoroughly this interesting and complex personalityto mention the great dramatic quality of some of the long poems in the bookFrom that point of viewThe Great Adventure of Max Breuck seems to me the most interestingAnd there is much to be said of the sincerity and depth of sentiment in such poems as A GiftStupidityPatienceAbsenceAll these short poems have something unique about them and constitute one of the greatest charmsand an important part of the valueof the bookIt is almost incredible that a little poem like Obligationfor exampleshould contain such a world of thought and restrained sentiment in its ten short linesI have chosen this poem as the type of this genrebecause it characterizes perhaps better than any other this very special trait of Miss Lowell s talent Hold your apron wide That I may pour my gifts into itSo that scarcely shall your two arms hinder them From falling to the groundI would pour them upon you cover yougreatly do I feel this need giving you somethingthese poor things Dearest of my heartThere isin these few linesa simplicity so naivea sincerity so completeand at the same time such an intensity of feelingthat we almost feel while reading it as if we were composing it ourselvesAnd everybody knows that this is the mark of geniusIt is rare to attain such perfection in thought and in form as we find in these short poemswhich stand on their stemsstraight and purelike wild flowers opening their hearts to the sunI should likein conclusionto speak of the very new and effective attempts of the author in the free use of all possible rhythmsThe preface presents the author s point of viewbut I may add that she has been especially skilful in the adaptation of the rhythms to the subjectsa thing which requires great poetic tact and musical senseTo study this side of the book would carry us too farfor to do it properly a long article written especially on the subject would be necessaryTo those who love poetryand who are at the same time interested in the progress of new schoolsthis book must be of the greatest valueMAGDELAINE CARRETThe Man and the Artist Achievementby ETemple Thurston DAppleton and New York Every man knows himself but there are few women with all their experience of men who act as if they knew anything about themFor it is only in moments that men are dispassionate about womenwhile half their lives through women are being dispassionate about men Why is it that such glistening generalities prove invariably attractive to thegeneral readerPerhaps the poor maligned grfancies he is gettingtipson the values of his neighborslivesor interminablegood leadsas to his own adventuresPerhaps the fatuous distinctions merely tickle the sex vanityUndoubtedly the same word wisdomoffered in regard to mankind and without the alluring distinction between man and womanwould secure but half the attentionThis attention seems no whit slackened if the generalities are manifestly unfair by reason of their fealty to traditionalismas MrThurston s statements of this ilk are apt to beThe foregoing generality is not unfair to MrThurstonsince this attractive bait is offered without stint in his latest novel AchievementIn factthe theme of the book is that ancient perennial among popular themesthe conflict between a man and his loves in this case finding its redemption from the usual in that the protagonist is the man s work rather than the manYetin spite of these sops to Cerberusthe book does not holdIt is but another of the multiplying outputs of today which are interesting to the critic aloneand to him only as a study in the pathology of the creative instinctThe lay reader will find himself nodding over the crucial scenes or will lose his place time and againif he persist in reading to the endIf a sense of justice will not permit him to judge the whole by a parthis persistence is tribute only to the undeniable sincerity of aim felt throughout the workA stronger tributeof courseis the mere length of this Review The factthat isthat whatever of critic be in the reading mind is drawn to reiterate questions and puzzle over their answeras to the reason for the falling short of this novel from the better standardsmanifestly striven afterThe reader who does concern himselfthenwith Achievement will be puzzledperhaps irritatedby the insistent questionBut what is the matter There is a certain mastery of wordsthere is honesty and sensitiveness of treatmentto a degree beyond the usual moreoverside by side with the theme properis carried a sympathetic and reverent revelation of the mind of a creative artistin this casea painter a study alone sufficient to redeem the work from the stigma of tritenessThese qualities should carry any novel into favor at least might be expected to overshadow the noticeable unevenness of workastonishing in an author of ETemple Thurston s apprenticeshipBut the book fails to convinceThe only lasting impression it leaves is the question Why inadequate Perhaps the answer lies in the inadequacy of the theme itselfThis may be voicedin both its major and minor keysthrough MrThurston s own words For as it is the tragedy of women when the romance of love is gone from themso it is the tragedy of menwhen their work is done Had the author juggled the words of that sentence a bit had it read so The realization that the romance of love has gone out from one s life is no more a tragedy than the instant when one knows that his work is donecould the author have conceived this themethe subject of achievement would have compelled a more worthy treatmentHad he been able to think of women and men as alike potentwhether creators or loversthen his picture of the creator in Richard Furlong fertilized by the lover in him might have been adequateThe greatest need of today is a pronoun of the common genderIt is beginning to be recognized that the generation now growing up to face the ultimate issues of living is one which will declare that spiritual experience is basically an unsexed phenomenonWoman of today has been heard to declare that whatever charge can be made about man s potentialitieseven his propensitiescan be charged alike to the womanThis is no meaningless attitudeNeither is it naive nor amusingly unscientificwhen the young girl of the future lifts her voice and sings out Before she is woman or he is a manman and woman are alike persons In this theoremdifficult to wordlies the fertile germ of suffragefeminismsuffragettismmilitant ismand all the other lifted voices of womanNo one of the women of MrThurston s portrayal is of value to herself or to the lives about herexcept as a womana slave or queen of manhis toy or his inspirationlife s parasiteThe author would answer that he is not attempting a study of womanbut of an artist achieving by means of womanNone the lessif all the women who influence his artist were drawn in as hunchbackswe would resent the distorted picturethe hypothesis that woman is essentially hunchbackedThussince all the women in Achievement are traditionally paralyzed womenwe resent the generic theme of art under influence of womanhoodIn order to receive serious audience todayany portrayal of womanindirectly or directlymust recognize that there are genuine women as there are menwho live in terms of selfhood rather than in terms of sexThe denouement is the usual stock company curtainHoweverif so many pistol shots per volume is a stipulation in the novelist s contractit must be conceded him that his telling of the murder is admirably simpleA more admirable simplicity is attained in the trenchant description of the murderer s psychology after the deedThe author is to be congratulated for missing thatopportunityfor analysisof which the usual fiction writer spins chapter after chaptermorbida snare to catch cheap horror and pitya spider web for fliesThat the scene of the last two pages should have been written once is regrettableThat these pages were not cut out hastily as soon as written is unforgivable in an author who desires so profoundly to be in sympathy with the artist who has achievedREthel Sidgwick s BooksSmallMaynard and CompanyBoston I cannot let another issue of TH E LITTLE REVIEW go to press without some mention of Ethel SidgwickLast yearwith a sense of worshipI read Successionthe second volume of a trilogy devoted to the story of a boy wonder violinistTo find such subtletysuch radiancesuch art to find such musicin a piece of fiction was an unforgetable experienceMusic has never been so richly treated in fiction except in Jean Christophewhich of course is the master work of the last yearsI felt that I had never comprehended any character so fully as I did little Antoineand I still feel that wayThis year on Christmas dayas a sort of special celebrationI read the first volumePromiseIt is just as interestingthough there is not such a brilliant concentration of art in itBut isn t there some way to make these books known They will never be popular but it is tragic to think of their not getting to the people who would value themTheir publishers would far rather advertise their cheap fiction than to try to force Ethel Sidgwick on a nation that does not demand good work of novelistsThe Little Review Oxford and Genius Sinister Streetby Compton Mackenzie DApplet on and CompanyNew York ETemple Thurston attracted attention here before Compton Mackenzie didbut the latter is as far ahead of him now as is Gilbert Canaanwhose Peter Homunculus came out about the time of Thurston s City of Beautiful NonsenseThese three young Englishmen know how to write English proseMackenzie and Canaan know how to tell big storiesSinister Street is much too important a book to be reviewed in less than three or four pages at leastThe first part of it tells of the modern man at Oxforda more complete account of the mind of a young man of our day than has been written previously in Englishan account which presents some of the things that Thackeray meant when he complained that his public would not permit him to tell all he wished about Pendennisand a good many more besides as Lucien Cary has saidIt is so extremely well done that the second part of the volume the hero s reactions to life after Oxford comes with a sense of forced writingPerhaps the war had something to do with itWe shall try to review this book more at length later Without Machiavelian SubtletyThe War and Cultureby John Cowper Powys GArnold New YorkAmong all the patriotic rubbish that has been heaped upon the book market since the outbreak of the European warMrPowys s pamphlet presents at least not dull readingThe brilliant lecturer unmasques the underlying motives of German statesmen who have accepted Machiavelian principles without acquiring Machiavelian subtlety He successfully attacks Munsterberg and other apologists for the Fatherlandwho endeavor to present their country in the image of an innocent lamb dragged into the bloody struggle by greedy barbariansMrPowyssmission is a negative oneand there it endsHe falls flat as soon as he attempts to idealize and to glorify the AlliesHis speculation that the present war as a struggle of ideasof individualism versus stateof soul versus machineis far fetchedThe Reader Critic Powys on Dostoevsky A reader sends us these jottings from one of MrPowys s lectures Shudders of lifeI have only one thing to do to bring you into a strange mass of palpable darkness with something moving in itDostoevsky is really a great massa volumenot a cloud nor a pillar of fire nor a puff of smokebut a vastformlessshapeless mass of darknesspalpable and drawing you towards itselfReading him is dangerous because of the inherent sense of fear likely to be accentuated in those who are a little mad and whose madness takes on the form of fearWe go on a visit to a mad houseto hospitals with DostoevskyBut with him this whole world suddenly changes into a mad houseIt is all haunting mad houses and hospitals filled with us maniacs of the particular fear we are subject to Life is all a running away a distractionWe are running away when we are talkingwhen we are making love then more than everperhaps In Dostoevsky we suddenly realize that these Russians are ourselvesIf the religionmysticismliberalismdespotism they possess were only Russian there are excellent books written by travellers in Russia for us to readBut Dostoevsky is differentIf I could but mesmerize you It is like reading the gospels in childhoodbeing overrun and overthrown by fate and then after one has lived meeting the words of the childhood situations and making associationsI do not think of him as an artistthough he is a great oneYou do not think of himIn ordinary life we suppress half the things and more we might sayVanity and fear are the ultimate thingsIn Dostoevsky the people tug and scrape at one anothersvain nerves with adder s poisonHe gives one the sensation of discovering one s self and betraying one s selfHe reveals as friends talking and discussing in the small hours of the morning reveal themselves to one anotherThe talk may be a describing of the animal functions of the human bodyBut in reality it is the psychic tinglingelectric vibrations which the physiological structure exerts upon mindMindMindDostoevsky is interested in what people actually feelHe is more with people who have written diaries than with so called realistic novelistsOne gets from him a sense of perversion of human imagination He is the most important of novelists full of ripples and vibrations of imaginationEverybody has imaginationThe things we do are nothingImagination is the only thing over which Will has no powerNietzsche says that he got all his contemporary philosophy from DostoevskyHe got from him even his idea of the inner circle of aristocratic souls who really rule the worldare themselves unhappyand take with others to places which theythese otherscannot enterDostoevsky thinks that the secret of the world is in abandonmentperversion Nietzsche in hardnessstiffnessthe gaythe strongthe beautifularistocraticdominant Nietzsche with all his reality does not describe life as it isZarathustra is a dream impossible perhapsBut Dostoevsky does describe lifeNietzsche s man is absolutely alone has his own hellDostoevsky s has that toobut in a different wayHe gives the feeling of a third person where two are aloneDo not think that Dostoevsky is a mysticThe essential thing is that you have this sense of a third person to which genius appealsDostoevsky is a stronger as well as a truer one than even Nietzsche himselfNietzsche is as a skater upon the icea dancer upon a tight rope who remains a whitebalanced figure on the surfaceDostoevsky plunges into a darkness full of voicesYou must get there by a form of perversionEvery one of his characters is incurably hurtNietzscheans harden their hearts and live on the surfaceAll Dostoevsky people are weakHe thinks that only out of weakness will redemption come abandonment to every emotionIn that he is Dionysian Dostoevsky I cannot put into wordsPerversion Disease God is Disease God is Pain Dostoevsky depicts how Disease gives one illuminationWe have an idea that we must be wellEven Nietzsche says thatThe Greeks said it ages agoDostoevsky saysNo I offer you a new value He has a lust for fools understands the mania that people have of making fools of themselvesGod is Folly God is Cruelty perhaps an epicene GodDostoevsky is a celebralistHis specialty is imaginative reactionsAll the lusts that have stretched their wailing armsall the hopesall the goblins In sex as in everything else people are not what they are doingthey are in that vortex of what they imagine themselvesDostoevsky understands all thatThose frank spoken people who think they know sex are puritans on the other sideThey have no imaginationWe can overestimate what Dostoevsky has from Russia and not attribute what he is to himselfOther Russians are Russians TurgenievTolstoyAndreyevChekhovGorky but they are not as big as he isperhaps they are more of the broader stampConstance Garnett s translations are masterpiecesThe French are too artistic to translate Dostoevsky No one can approach Dostoevsky in creating a saintRussia as the spiritual bringer back of the world to Christianity this runs through his worksHe is the ChristianHis books are full of translations from ScriptureHe understands the underlying psychology of the gospelsNietzsche said that putting the gospels with the art of the Old Testament was a crime in the name of ArtThe Old Testament is undoubtedly finer artbut the New is psychology masterlyThe Little Review 63 VERS LIBRE AND COMMON SENSE Clinton MasseckStLouisVers Libre has no inconsiderable tradition in English verseas MrArthur Ficke has recently pointed out in TH E LITTL E REVIEW Its progress in French poetryparticularly among modern writersis familiar to all studentsAnd if we were inclined to forget or to forgive Whitmanmeaning in politer terms to accept him and his followers the recent verse of the Imagiste group and such writers as Miss Amy Lowell and MrMax Bodenheim in our own midst would be likely to force our attention to this interesting form if I may employ this word in no paradoxical senseBut vers libre is of the moment newif you willin its present appealIts modern themesits unique figures of speechits wide practiceboth in this country and in Englandmark it as a new movementor at least a new recrusenceAnything new invites attack anything new in literature perhaps warrants attackIf it can stand the testby just such a tokenit is worth

scholastic in his handlinghe might be amusingHe is also distinctly pugnacious andas most pugnacious people are inclined to behe is curiously inconsistentIn factit is a little difficult to determine why MrJones cannot accept Bodenheim He is guilty of reading Meredith popularly supposed to be obscureBecause our poet writes ofa world of growing sievesslim squarespowdered soulscoolcolorless strugglesthe obstetrical adventures of white throatsand green and yellow dins and because MrJonesin the smallness of his soul or environmenthas never been able to concoct or to conceive of poetry couched in this garb let us grant the idea behind it he straightway announcesThis will never do Wordsworthafter being so thoroughlysievedby the criticsstill lives the divine essence of romanticism was not killed by Jeffrey and his thunder pellet phraseCourageMrBodenheim Yet in a really admirable paragraph of summary as to the function of poetry and the relation of a poet to his audienceMrJones lays down the dictum thatthe poet sees the world as we do not see itConsequentlyhe can put a new complexion on it for usThe world is pluralisticand so are weIntellectually we may be of the twentieth centurybut emotionally we may be born out of our due seasonThen let the poet of that due season mediate to us the emotional life that we needBy his aid alone we may get outside of our own skins and into the very heart of the world The last words of this statement are peculiarly significant in this connection By his aid alone we may get outside of our skins into the very heart of the world What is the heart of the worldI do not know it allemotionally or intellectuallyalthough if I were to trust one of these endowments in order to render judgment upon poetryI should choose the firstOn the other handMrJones does not know the entire heart of the world nor does MrBodenheimBut we may each of us know some little corner of this heart that the other does not or cannot ever knowFor some of us poetry remains but the supreme expression of mere external beautyfor others the expression in consummate form of a purely intellectual process to others poetry is a weapon wherewith to pierce the veil of externality and to expose the hidden but the real realityThe late William James once declared that we were standing on the verge of new discoveries in feeling and knowledgethat just beyond us lies a world of new adjustments and new experiencesOf coursein this instanceJames had reference to our new appreciation and estimate of the value of mysticism in the judgment of certain phases of religious experiencesBut the thing holds true even in poetry the line between the poet and the mystic has yet to be drawnIfor oneshould not want to think myself incapable of enlarging either my soul or my appreciationIf anybody can show me whether in new terms or not a hitherto unsuspected and unknown aspect of beautyI shall be content to accept that personI would go further I should be very thankful that I had obtained a new point of view with which to regulate both my emotions and my intellectIfor onesaw and felt and appreciated the appeal of the much discussedsievepoemTo be surealong with MrJonesI had previously thought of a sieve only in relation to ashes and garden earth and even of thatlittle triangular sieve that fits into kitchen sinks But if some one can come along and convince me that this hitherto vulgar and despised implement has inherent in it the possibilities of metaphysical developmentand that a certain person can be likened to a sievewhythen I have learned a new aspect of beautyAnd henceit would seem to me that MrBodenheim has fulfilled every single requirement that MrJones has put upon the poetAnd the only reason MrJones cannot appreciate these little poems is becauseintelectually and emotionallyhe isborn out of due seasonAfter all All art is convention The Alaskan Indianwith his grotesque to ustotem polescannot understand the smooth and plastic strength of much of classic sculptureThe African Negrowith his Campbell soup can earrings and his Connecticut made curtain ring braceletscannot appreciate the effect of simple unadornment Yet in any case the point of viewthe impelling instinct that leads toward beautyis the same for any personany raceany civilizationLet us be honest and admit thisLet us sincerely seek and discover the philosophy that guides every newwhether in fashion or food or poetry it seems to me that we are too prone to accept poetry and to judge it from autilitarian point of viewWe would make it stand the same test that we applyreligionto household furnacesand other things that have been long triedWe askwhen some new manifestation of it arises Will it do the trickWill itand warm and sustain us in the way that we have

fresh significance or a bold interpretationwe jump back in terror and horrorSo it is with vers libre at the present momentBecause it shows us new thingsand a new and perhaps at times an awkward mannercritics fed on the diluted centimentality of Longfellow or even the classic and obscure Meredith revoltEventually they will accept itthey mustThose that are not fools must remember that history repeats itself that to cite but a recent instanceManet and Monet and Sisleyin paintingare accepted where forty five years ago they were characterized as fools andmadmenAfter time has crystalized the

appreciateIt will be then too late what was once unique and rare will be common and banally uninterestinga new awakening will then take placeand once more the world will witness the same absurd attack of the criticsIn this connectionin our future judgment of vers librelet us recall the wise and simple words of RAMStevenson The test of a new thing is not utilitywhich may appear at any moment like a shoot with the first favouring breath of springThe test is the kind and amount of human feeling and intellect put into the workCould any fool do itNowin this matter of depicting truththere are
