Nor colors clear nor gray  Nor women s ways Nor those of men Nor blame nor praise Where am I then  Oh fragrantly The airs of earth arise In waking hours of light While vagrantly Sea symphonies Of changing sound surprise   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Till for a space one goes Beyond the salt and snows And searching tides along the wide stretched beach Beyond the last faint reach Of odor sight and sound far forth far forth Where neither South nor North Points down the roads unguessed Where East is not nor West At night down roads of sleep Of dreamless sleep Past all the compassed ways the reason tells To unknown citadels  Just as one turns and while day s dusk breathed blue And music many dappled merge in flight Half in a dream one finds a tale is true That down one s memory sings still and light Just as the spirit turns Half dreaming one discerns Deeply the tale is true That long ago one knew Of how a mermaid loved a mortal knight And how unless she died she still must change And leave his human ways and go alone At intervals where seas unfathomed range Through coral groves around the ocean s throne Where cool armed mermaids dive through crystal hours And braid their streaming hair with pearls and sing   Sleep  Among the green and clear lit water flowers The sea changed splendors of their ocean king  Like hers our ways on earth Who from our day of birth Would die unless we slept  Must die unless for hours Beyond our senses powers  Down soundless space we leapt  Beyond the deepest roll  Of pain s and rapture s sweep  Where goes the human soul  That vanishes in sleep  Down dreamless paths unguessed beyond the senses powers Beyond the breath of fragrance sound and light As once through crystal unremembered hours The mermaid dived who loved a mortal knight Far forth far forth Beyond the South or North Past all the compassed ways the day has shown To live divine and deep at night down roads of sleep In citadels unknown POETRY A Magazine of Verse  CITY WHISTLES  To H M  Now the morning winds are rising Now the morning  whistles cry Fast their crescent voices dim the paling star Through the misted city mainland wide their questing sum  mons fly Many toned O mortal tell me who you are Down the midland down the morning fresh their sweep  ing voices buoy Siren ship Silver ship Sister ship Ahoy Sister ship ahoy Ship ahoy What s the stuff of life you re made from What the cargo  you must trade from From afar their onward voices break the blue Crying Bring your gold or barley Come to barter Come  to parley Ring the bell and swing the bridge and let me through Like some freighted ship that goes where the city river flows Like a trading ship that questions Who are you In among the river craft as she rides by stack and shaft Through Chicago from Sheboygan and the Soo What s the stuff of life you re made from What the  cargo you convoy Ring the bell Swing the bridge Sister ship ahoy   City Whistles  At last The twilight rises fast Hard was the day The questing whistles say Over wall and plinth ascendant smoke wreaths hyacinth  resplendent Curl and flow And many voiced the evening whistles bay Hard was our day The scaling whistles say Our jarred and jangled day Then all their clamors blow Great was our day And sing a tale of fate untold and fugitive Something spacious something mordant something gracious  and discordant Mean and splendid something all our lives here live Down the midland mists at twilight have you heard their  singing sweep Where their far toned voices many chorded buoy And our mortal ways in wonder hail creation s unknown  deep Siren ship Silver ship Sister ship ahoy  Edith Wyatt   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MARTIN OF TOURS  As I today was wayfaring Holy Holy Holy low  Said Christ in heaven s evening  The Holies yet more hushed and slow I met a knight upon the road A plumed charger he bestrode  He saw the beggar that was I Holy Holy Holy long Head and foot one beggary  Holy Holy Holy song One that shivered in the cold While his horse trailed cloth of gold  Down he leaped his sword outdrawn Holy Holy Holy swells Cleaved his cloak laid half upon  Holy now a peal of bells Shoulders that the cross had spanned And I think he kissed my hand  Then he passed the road along Holy Holy Holy laud Caroling a knightly song  Holy in the face of God  Yea Father by Thy sovereign name Begging is a goodly game  Charles L O Donnell   PROFILES FROM CHINA  THE STORY TELLER  In a corner of the market place he sits his face the target for many eyes  The sombre crowd about him is motionless inert Behind their faces no lamp burns only their eyes glow faintly with a reflected light  For their eyes are on his face It alone is alive is vibrant moving bronze under a sun of bronze  The taut skin like polished metal shines along his cheek and jaw His eyes cut upward from a slender nose and his quick mouth moves sharply out and in  Artful are the gestures of his mouth elaborate and full of guile When he draws back the bow of his lips his face is like a mask of lacquer set with teeth of pearl fantastic terrible   What strange tale lives in the gestures of his mouth  Does a fox maiden bewitching tiny footed lure a scholar to his doom Is an unfilial son tortured of devils Or does a decadent queen sport with her eunuchs  I cannot tell The faces of the people are wooden only their eyes burn  dully with a reflected light I shall never know I am alien alien   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  OUR CHINESE ACQUAINTANCE  We met him in the runway called a street between the warrens known as houses He looked still the same but his French cut tweeds his continental hat and small round glasses were alien here About him we felt a troubled uncertainty  He greeted us gladly It is good he said in his soft French to see my foreign friends again You find our city dirty I am sure on every stone dirt grows in China  How the people crowd The street is choked Nong koi chi Go away curious ones The ladies cannot breathe No my people are not clean They do not understand I  think In Belgium where I studied You did not know Yes I was studying in Bruges study  ing Christianity when the great war came We you know love peace I could not see  So I came home  But China is very dirty our priests are rascals and the people I do not know Is there perhaps a true religion somewhere  Behind his glasses his slant eyes were troubled I do not know he said We met him in the runway called a street between the war  rens known as houses   A Scholar  A SCHOLAR  You sit chanting the maxims of Confucius On your head is a domed cap of black satin and your supple  hands with their long nails are piously folded You rock to and fro rhythmically Your voice rising and falling in clear nasal monosyllables  flows on steadily monotonously like the flowing of water and the flowering of thought You are chanting it seems of the pious conduct of man in all ages And I know you for a scoundrel  None the less the maxims of Confucius are venerable and your voice pleasant I listen attentively  CHINESE NEW YEAR  Mrs Sung has a new kitchen god  The old one he who has presided over the household this twelvemonth has returned to the Celestial Regions to make his report  Before she burned him Mrs Sung smeared his mouth with  sugar so that doubtless the report will be favorable Now she has a new god As she paid ten coppers for him he is handsomely painted  and should be highly efficacious So there is rejoicing in the house of Mrs Sung   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE MOST SACRED MOUNTAIN  Space and the twelve clean winds of heaven And this sharp exultation like a cry after the slow six thousand steps of climbing This is Tai Shan the beautiful the most holy  Below my feet the foot hills nestle brown with flecks of green and lower down the flat brown plain the floor of earth stretches away to blue infinity  Beside me in this airy space the temple roofs cut their slow curves against the sky And one black bird circles above the void  Space and the twelve clean winds are here And with them broods eternity a swift white peace a presence manifest The rhythm ceases here Time has no place This is the end that has no end  Here when Confucius came a half a thousand years before the Nazarene he stepped with me thus into timelessness  The stone beside us waxes old the carven stone that says On this spot once Confucius stood and felt the smallness of the world below  The stone grows old Eternity is not for stones   The Most Sacred Mountain  But I shall go down from this airy space this swift white peace this stinging exultation And time will close about me and my soul stir to the rhythm of the daily round Yet having known life will not press so close and always I  will feel time ravel thin about me For once I stood In the white windy presence of eternity  Eunice Tietjens  ENOUGH  I was born to those who longed for me Ere ever my life began I have glimpsed the soul of a woman And fought the fight of a man I have reared a child and thought of God Now Death do what you can  Winifred Webb   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ON THE LAND  THE BLACK LAND  I will plough the land Turning up the black soil I will ride upon this heaving surface As a boat rides upon the water Even as a boat Cleaving the water with an eager keel I have run a furrow Straight across the ridges  I will sow down this field Scattering gems With both hands will I scatter Quivering emeralds out of a bottomless pouch  As I tread the loam My feet sink deep The black earth embraces my ankles And clings to my bent knees  I sing as I go Scattering emeralds The wind sings upon my lips And pearls stream off my neck and forehead I am bathed in a sweat of pearls  Eyes straight forward Rest on a brightening ultimate slope   Succession  SUCCESSION  It is not as if I stood alone When I stop to rest the horses And take a look at the sky It is not me So much as my father Stopping in the same furrow For I have his shoulders And his eyes  And when I stumped that field I felt as if I were his father Who cleared the first land And built the house My father built on the ell But he slept himself In his father s bed In the old house And that s where I sleep  I hope my son will stick to the land I like to watch him plough Upon that hillside And burn brush Along the road It is as much me As it is himself And as much my father As either of us   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE RED LAND  In the autumn Bathed in gold dust I shall strip the red land Of a golden harvest  Oh fruitful as the red land Bearing golden harvest In the autumn Bountiful as the prairie Heaving milky breasts On flushed horizons  My hand slackens In the act of cutting While I lose myself In these blue distances  The scythe pauses On the neck of the wheat As my heart faints against These flushed horizons  I that have seen the sky In the time of reaping Between her breasts In the wheat field Sowing and reaping There I worship The land Joseph Warren Beach   NOVEMBER ON THE LAKE MICHIGAN DUNES  The dunes are graves that shift and dance Showing a skeleton When by the pushing wind s advance Their coffin is undone And in the ribbed and bitter sand A murdered tree puts out A white limb like a ghastly hand A dead trunk like a snout  The dunes are ghosts that line the beach Hidden and veiled and wild Now holding silence each with each Now lisping like a child And to their speech the waves reply The wind and the low waves Whispering and wildly wondering why They talk of ghosts and graves  They are as graves they are as ghosts They are as sphinxes set For umpires on these desolate coasts With life and death at fret Life with her grass and juniper Death with his cloud of sand She strives with him and he with her Between the lake and land   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The poplars and the pines are hers His are the sands and wind Sometimes his desperate breathing blurs The air till she grows blind She clutches up the dune to seek Sometime his throat to kill And always the troubled waters speak Always the sea gulls shrill  The wind is fellow once with Death Storming against the land  He howls across the hills his breath Burdened with snow and sand The wind is fellow once with Life  Sweeping against the sea Sweeping across the waves in strife With Death for enemy  Yet life and death and land and lake To him what things are these Whether the sand dunes shoreward shake Fleeing the broken seas Whether the water be as glass Or wild beasts without chains They change and shift and scud and pass Only the wind remains   November on the Lake Michigan Dunes  Only the wind The dead leaves flee lik e smoke the blue lake fades The hills flow down into the sea And night and day like shades About a carried lantern run Jigging alternately And star and moon and bolted sun Slide crazily in the sky  O God The whole world like the dunes Dances fantastic wise Down to what end before what tunes Beneath what dancing skies And blown along like grains of sand Ourselves must whirl and flee Before a wind across the land Into what open sea  Howard Mumford Jones POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TRENCH POEMS  MARCHING  My eyes catch ruddy necks Sturdily pressed back All a red brick moving glint Like flaming pendulums hands Swing across the khaki Mustard colored khaki To the automatic feet  We husband the ancient glory In these bared necks and hands Not broke is the forge of Mars But a subtler brain beats iron To shoe the hoofs of death Who paws dynamic air now Blind fingers loose an iron cloud To rain immortal darkness On strong eyes  BREAK OF DAY IN THE TRENCHES  The darkness crumbles away It is the same old Druid Time as ever Only a live thing leaps my hand   Break of Day in the Trenches  A queer sardonic rat As I pull the parapet s poppy To stick behind my ear Droll rat they would shoot you if they knew Your cosmopolitan sympathies  And God knows what antipathies Now you have touched this English hand You will do the same to a German Soon no doubt if it be your pleasure To cross the sleeping green between It seems you inwardly grin as you pass Strong eyes fine limbs haughty athletes Less chanced than you for life Bonds to the whims of murder Sprawled in the bowels of the earth The torn fields of France What do you see in our eyes At the boom the hiss the swiftness The irrevocable earth buffet A shell s haphazard fury What rootless poppies dropping But mine in my ear is safe Just a little white with the dust  Isaac Rosenberg   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MATERNITY  I am here my beloved  Sturdy is earth Dull and mighty Unresentful  Of her own fertility Covering her scars With healing green  You cannot anger earth You cannot cause her pain Nor make her remember Your hungry querulous love  At last your unwilling body She tranquilly accepts And turns it to her uses  EPITAPHS  I  Here lies a lady Who smothered before she died Crushing every impulse of her soul For prudence sake Only her body lived To be buried   Epitaphs  II  Sacred to the memory Of a genius who lied From necessity from pleasure and from habit If this be his soul this sturdy shade Perverse but virile even in death He will deny it  III  Here sleeps Earth s hungry child  IV  Beautiful lady Even death is your courtly lover Bearing you in his arms to infinity With tenderness  V  Here lies a man Who wasted in a hundred places A bit of his soul Yet even now it has a certain life Like the vague sighing Of a multitude of insects Dancing in the twilight   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  VI  Her spirit a shining blade Piercing her breast Pierced even the veil of death And we who knew her know It never can lie sheathed In eternal mist  VII  A man lies here  Who took sport seriously  Forgetting life His soul like a lost ball  Lies happy as a field mouse  Or a cricket  In the long grass  VIII  Here lies one Whose glowing faith Shouting hosannas through the dark Shall see its God Even as the sprouting grain The sun  Marjorie Allen Seiffert   RELIGION  In a far olden time On the marge of some era Devonian When budding breezes began to sweep The tops of the fern tree fronds The little wild people clinging along the roots Quivered with apprehension By and by they dared to look up There is a Something there they said It is God they cried And hid themselves  By and by a mole crept along And stirred the grass It is God the people said And shrank away terrified  After some eons One who was akin to prophets whispered Let us make for ourselves an image of God Like a mole And they did so  They made him like a cat like an ox like a serpent They devised a flying horse a grifon a dragon They imagined winged angels Guardian angels   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Lost angels These are gods and part gods they said They live on a Hill in the Sky On the top of the Great Mountain Sometime they will come down And talk with us  Time went on and I was born And I too heard a mystic breathing Trembling delicately among the tree tops I listened in a trance And I said It is God A little blind mole crept by my feet It is the gentle touch of God I cried in ecstasy But when I looked into your god like eyes my friend My heart almost stopped beating in its joy Now do I verily see God I exulted  GHOSTS OF PAST TIME  AH interminable procession of ghosts of past time Floats continually by me in my dreams  And they all reach out their hands to me Warning appealing commanding A few seem benign But though their touch is soft as snow They have a grip like iron   Ghosts of Past Time  Some were builders and they cry Build like me And some were wiseacres and they demand Think like me And some were poets and they whisper Sing like me  I throw you off O you ghosts of past time As for me I will work along your tiresome squares and cube9 But I will not build like you O builders I will eat your nauseous wisdoms O wiseacres But I will not think like you I will move in your deepest rhythms But I will not sing like you O poets Like myself only will I think and build and sing And not like any of you Even you my veritable brothers Who died but yesterday I am not thinking of you But of some one to be born tomorrow  Martha Foot e Crow   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE COUNSELS OF O RIORDAN THE RANNMAKER  The choirs of Heaven are tokened in a harp string  A pigeon s egg is as crafty as the stars  My heart is shaken by the crying of the lapwing And yet the world is full of foolish wars  There s gold on the whin bush every summer morning There s struggling discourse in the grunting of a pig Yet churls will be scheming and churls will be scorning And half the dim world is ruled by thimblerig  The luck of God is in two strangers meeting But the gates of hell are in the city street For him whose soul is not in his own keeping And love a silver string upon his feet  My heart is the seed of time my veins are star dust My spirit is the axle of God s dreams Why should my august soul be worn or care tost Lo God is but a lamp and I his gleam  There s little to be known and that not kindly But an ant will burrow through a five inch wall There s

me everything again Care suffering shame  I gave you everything I let you daub my love with filthy lust You gave me everything again Ashes and bitter dust  I gave you everything Children toil gold You

CONTRADICTION  Yesterday I borrowed thirty silver pence From Judas he gave them with a grin Today O Christ I kneel before your cross  Yesterday the Magdalen came to me and said I am starving I answered First to bed Today O Christ I kneel before your cross  Yesterday the Virgin passed sorrowing in the street I flung a brick at her Then as was meet I bore her to the house of Caiphas Today O Christ I kneel before your cross  Yesterday Pilate asked me for water I must go He beat me for the ewer trembled so Today O Christ I kneel before your cross  Yesterday today tomorrow I am vile You

Each day when I try to cross the street I find I cannot go my way The street is too crowded with blind people  They jostle me into gutters They fling me curses from livid lips They strike me with their heavy sticks They the blind hating all who see  Yet they huddle and press upon me Fawning and saying sweet false things Whenever they would borrow my eyesight To look for some penny lost in the gutter  WHY THE WAR  They went to a field and there lay two swords and two  ploughshares And the first man said Plow brother But the second man frowned and growled tossing his head We must kill each

must kill each other  Then let us strive if you will but only in peace In life let us conquer each other Death settles the contest more quickly one cut will release We must kill each other  If death settles all why then either fight or strive Let us sit down on the grass and weep for each other Because only so can the farce be played to the last Draw brother  John Gould Fletcher  EDITORIAL COMMENT  THEN AND NOW  THE holiday festivities are close upon us  Christmas with its multiform invitation to  worldliness confusing and obliterating its  spiritual significance the New Year with its  hope of fresh life through the cold its gleam  of sunshine over snow both set with full dramatic intensity  against the world s super activities of peace and war  As they approach in a glorious and confusing riot the  eighteenth century seems a satisfactory age to live in  some Jane Austen village of narrow boundaries and prim  ideals The weaver and cobbler down the little street  bread and meat in the neighboring farms splendor in the  squire s mansion and religion in the little old church whose  bell pealed out a welcome on Sundays The vast world  lumbering in and out once or twice a week in the stage  coach from London so many leagues away bringing ideas  in the Lovers Annual or the Gentleman s Magazine An  orderly finished world with a definite social system in  which one kept one s place and a neat little round of  duties and pleasures patterned against a pearl gray back ground of leisure  Instead of that behold me almost any me in this par  ticularly distracting season We will pass over my par  ticular business of editing a magazine almost any busi  ness nowadays brings mail from the ends of the earth a   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  queer sense of intimacy with the antipodes To me almost any me comes this autumn the election and to the feminine me in these parts the exceeding great thrill of casting her first vote for president the climax of soulful communings and quarrellings in the newly opened field And after the quiet ballot in an alcove comes the swift rolling in of states like vast billows through a stormy night of searchlights tin horns steam whistles and caterwauling crowds and then the backwater tides of doubt for hours and days  And through the clamor of politics sounds the call of the arts the Art Institute opens new galleries much more spacious than our magazine gallery for poets in which hundreds of painters and sculptors from Maine to Oregon speak for beauty with still voices stretch out invisible hands appealing for recognition And the new Arts Club hits us between the eyes by contrasting Sargent with Henry Dearth the latest old with the newest new Blow on blow is struck ringing bell on bell  Then there are the plays Curtains rising everywhere on Mrs Warren s Profession and Medea on Henry VIII and Justice sermons all of them however they may conceal or betray it And a French company straight from Paris is playing Le Misanthrope and Sans GÃªne And little local companies are experimenting delicately with Ben Hecht s dark Dregs and Kenneth Goodman s gay harlequinade The Wonder hat and with Maxwell

embrace of brown darkness at last  Also the call of music will not be denied the orchestra the recitals the choral concerts And the opera unrolls its gilded scroll a mediaeval mummer using all the arts to pattern gorgeously the extravagant melodrama of his emotion  The clubs philanthropies civic activities these also are insistent demands not to be denied  Into this clamor of many voices this ringing of many bells comes the questioner Suddenly our occidental civilization the modern organization of society of The Nation for selfish ends for greed whose weapon is violence is challenged by the Bengali poet and sage Rabindranath Tagore who now wears the international crown decreed to him since he first befriended us with his presence and this magazine with his poems four years ago Something in his quiet dignity makes our over activity seem absurd Will there be any power left for life if we heed so many calls try to follow so many paths  In his lecture What Is Art Mr Tagore or rather Sir Rabindranath was at the opposite pole from Tolstoi Art is life s surplusage her excess of joy which she returns in beauty to her creator essentially an act of rapture of worship And the tall Hindu as he uttered his dithyrambic finale was unconsciously an illustration of his theme the ideal poet whose art has been one long devotion springing from excess of concentrated spiritual life the ideal poet   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of the orient moreover whose very presence is a wide winged benediction of peace  How many of our poets have learned the secret What is it to me that I am fed clothed and sheltered by a million hands in all the ends of the earth and informed of the world s news by a million minds What is it to me that I am speeded around the world in motors and steamers and trains and through still larger domains in art and talk and books The point is do these things magnify life or obliterate it How shall I live in and through by and with above and beyond all these H M  LAZY CRITICISM  The other day Mr Max Eastman editor of The Masses stepped out of his own back door and into the front door of The New Republic to say what he had to say about Lazy Verse and those who write it He couldn t of course have said it at home without violating the laws of hospitality  We sympathize with Mr Eastman  It is high time that a critic objected to vers libre not on the score of rhythm a phase of the subject endlessly debatable but on the score of style and for a few moments it looked as if Mr Eastman were about to prove the one exception who would establish the intelligence of the tribe But alas no Mr Eastman compares the new dilute variety of prosy poetry which is watering the country to journalism a comparison obviously insulting to the latter For while journalism generally speaking may not be literature   Lazy Criticism  much of what Mr Eastman calls lazy verse has not even achieved the level of a good piece of journalism For instance Mr Eastman s apostrophe to a blank book which he submits as showing that all one has to do to make a poem today is to say something does not really say much and what it does say it says badly it is not good journalism although it is rhythmical and almost if not wholly metrical  No instead of indicating that what keeps journalism from being literature is exactly what keeps much vers libre from being poetry and also what keeps much metrical verse from being poetry and literature Mr Eastman falls into the very pitfalls that all the other critics have dug and he even falls deeper in buries himself like an exploding shell For the total effect of his article is to put a halo about the head of anyone who writes metrical verse however poor to imply that there is some magic property in an arbitrary patterns which of itself induces high powers or the intense rhapsodies of art By direct inference from this article all vers libre is journalism all metrical verse literature a conclusion hard to accept  In fact Mr Eastman s article itself is an example not of fine and discriminating criticism but of that very slipshod journalism which he affects to scorn He has the courage of generalities a journalistic trait but not of particulars and criticism adheres in particulars He lumps all the writers of vers libre with the exception of Whitman Blake King Solomon Giovannitti and Tagore into the discard Those who found schools or who have the tag of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  a school are necessarily inferior a sweeping generalization and this from Mr Eastman who believes in the organization of labor and the disorganization of capitalized gangs like publishers etc  What poetry needs today is a critic who has the courage to discriminate among his contemporaries no matter with what schools their names may be associated whether by accident or design one who will uphold a standard of good style a standard of literature by which both vers libre and metrical verse may be judged and accepted or rejected It takes courage to criticize one s contemporaries but a critic who ventures only along the secure routes of the past or of accepted opinion ventures nothing Mr Eastman has avoided the issue  Apropos of the aboriginal indolence of the writer of vers  libre it is interesting to quote what Mr Littell has to say  of Swinburne in the same number of The New Republic in  which Mr Eastman s article appeared  Often you wonder as you read on and on whether his habit was not to start a poem with some fragment that occurred of itself and then to make more fragments in the same metre until his ear desired another metre when he would take what he had written choose a first stanza and a last and let the others arrange themselves What are they like these long and structureless poems as empty of meaning as of movement from mood to mood They are like blown fires that spread without arriving like champing swift horses always in the same place like huge elusive bellying sails that the mind cannot furl The emptiness is filled with lines that call and clang with a rushing wind of rhythm with a musical movement repeated and repeated until it gets into one s blood and the pulse beats to its measure and long after the wind has blown itself out the waves keep up their rolling and washing   Lazy Criticism  And yet it is the people who do not respond to this form of rhapsodic trance who are Mr Eastman says people so neutralized by effete parlor civilization that their vital organs are incapable of resounding to the fundamental trance engendering stroke of the tom tom They are incapable of hypnosis They are incapable of naively falling asleep to dream But is it not our effete parlor civilization that has produced this very verse with its empty meaningless song And if we demand a sharper sense of reality along with fundamental rhythms is it then because we are stultified with civilization  The difference between the hypnosis induced by this sophisticated poetry and that of primitive poetry is this that whereas with primitive poetry the effect is produced by the reiteration of a single line or image the sense of which is enlarged and intensified by repetition or by the trance engendering beat of the tom tom with the kind of poetry spoken of above the effect is produced by the rhythmical succession of phrases the meaning and sense of which are lost in the mechanical drum beat furnished by the verse itself Take away the drum beat of the latter form of verse and you have nothing left Take away the tom tom from primitive poetry take away even the repetition of the phrase and you still have the vital heart of the poem the emotional image  I can not follow Mr Eastman s psychology He implies that indulgence in vers libre is an example of aboriginal indolence then he says that it is because we lack primitive   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  qualities because of too much neural excitation and too little of the booming pulse of the blood that we do not respond to the refinements of civilized verse Vers libre is not Mr Eastman says a return to primitive naive or simple styles of writing but the height of effort at sophisticated stimulation of a jaded perception But could it not be is it not in fact both  To say that poets write the new free verse out of sheer indolence to escape the restrictions imposed upon them by metrical rhymed verse is nonsense If anything the metrical pattern offers a greater opportunity to the naturally indolent and lazy mind At least it seems easier to disguise lack of thought and feeling when a conventional metrical pattern and a rhyme scheme are adopted It is also foolish to think that vers libre is not a medium offering a vigorous resistance of its own simply because that resistance is less obvious The poet knows that it is just as hard to write good free verse as it is to write good metrical verse When either achieves the level of poetry the distinction between the two is unimportant  Marlowe and his contemporaries did not engage the medium of blank verse because it offered less resistance than rhymed verse Poets really do not react against conventional forms for indolent or for journalistic reasons There is always an artistic a psychological basis for such reactions The poet who uses vers libre is simply reacting against the kind of swaddling metrical rhythm suffocating the sense employed by Swinburne and other poets and more especially   Lazy Criticism  by their less gifted followers The reaction against this stultifying deadening cloak of rhythm is as natural and as justifiable artistically as was Wordsworth s reaction against poetic diction and rhetoric This is not to say that everyone who writes vers libre is a poet any more than that everyone who writes metrical verse has a right to the laurels with which Mr Eastman crowns him If the medium of vers libre has seemed to offer to prose writers an easy method of rushing into print as poets it is nevertheless true that the hand of the prose writer can invariably be detected in free verse nor does the mediocre poet do a bit better in this form than in his more conventional patterns Mr Eastman no doubt would deny the word form to vers libre But vers libre has form exactly as clouds have form and as infinite a variety of patterns although none may be regular or narrowly symmetrical Certainly no greater amount of aching feeling is poured into free verse today than was  formerly expressed with a fatal and glib facility through the medium of metres of every known variety under the sun This I have every reason to know  I am very very tired of the futile discussion about the relative merits of vers libre and metrical verse It really does not matter in which medium a poet chooses to express himself so long as he gives us real poetry and I refuse to believe that either medium is too easy or too hard or too old fashioned or too new to serve as a vehicle for the poet who is capable of using it A C H POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REVIEWS  MR YEATS NEW BOOK  Responsibilities and Other Poems by W B Yeats Macmillan Co  Mr Yeats new volume contains the poems which have previously appeared in the Cuala editions of Responsibilities and The Green Helmet Many of the short poems have appeared in POETRY and I have already written reviews of separate parts of the new volume There is therefore little need of more than an announcement of the new and more convenient edition  What strikes one on going through the larger book is the simple fact that Mr Yeats has not gone off He is the only poet of his decade who has not gradually faded into mediocrity who has not resigned himself to gradually weaker echoes of an earlier outburst  The new poems now that their bulk is equal to that of the two earlier volumes of poems hold their own they establish their own tonality I do not mean that every poem is a masterpiece or that every poem is important or that every poem would start a new reputation for an author not yet known But the collection as a whole is worthy of the collections that preceded it There is a new robustness there is the tooth of satire which is in Mr Yeats case too good a tooth to keep hidden The Coat the wild wolf dog that will not praise his fleas The Scholars are all the sort of poem that we would gladly read more of There   Mr Yeats New Book  are a lot of fools to be killed and Mr Yeats is an excellent slaughter master when he will but turn from ladies with excessive chevelure appearing in pearl pale nuances  We have all been bewitched with the glamour and the glamour is still there in The Wind Among the Reeds for those who still want it But the light in The Magi and The Peacock is a no less valuable light and born of a no less powerful magic The ragged hat in Biscay Bay is a sign of the poet s relationship to his brother Jack Yeats and a far cry from the bridles of Findrinny But despite such occasional bits of realism the tone of the new book is romantic Mr Yeats is a romanticist symbolist occultist for better or worse now and for always That does not matter What does matter is that he is the only one left who has sufficient intensity of temperament to turn these modes into art  Reveries Over Childhood and Youth appearing in a uniform Macmillan edition is written in a clearer and harder prose than most of Mr Yeats earlier prose books One might announce it here as an extended annotation or appendix to some of his earlier poems E P  OTHER BOOKS OF VERSE  A Marriage Cycle by Alice Freeman Palmer Houghton  Mifflin Co  opened this book with some hesitation would this strongly executive woman whom so many thousands loved and honored prove to have been indeed a poet   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I need not have feared And her husband the editor need not have apologized for the incompleteness and ragged ness of some of these poems It is true that certain ones show by their uncertain technique that she was starting timidly in a new adventure Even these however have simplicity and sincerity qualities which rise to perfect art in a few lyrics Indeed it is astonishing that a woman of such intensively literary training should have cast off all literary impedimenta in writing her poems  The deepest beauty of a rich and noble nature and incidentally the deepest beauty of marriage are revealed in this Cycle especially in poems like The Dress Summer Rain Myself The Last Anniversary and this fine lyric Parting  Dear love it was so hard to say  Goodby today  You turned to go yet going turned to stay  Till suddenly at last you went away  Then all at last I found my love unsaid  And bowed my head  And went in tears up to my lonely bed  Oh would it be like this if you were dead  H M  London One November by Helen Mackay Duffield amp Co  Most of these poems are in free verse Yet there is form in Miss Mackay s freedom A House is full of feeling and must make its appeal wherever it is read The death of the son of this house in the war has just been told in London  House great house how can you stay quiet like that When your only son is killed Why do you not cry out cry out to London   Other Books of Verse  Years lives stones iron rust bones mould and mildew of the centuries call to this poet and she voices their souls Roads Calling is very lyrical and haunting It has been said of a prose work by this author that it has the grace of Maeterlinck s delicate reveries and this is true of many of her poems Wind and Shadows with its lure of the mystical hidden might have been written by Maeterlinck himself Tran is full of Maeterlinckian lines take for instance these  Terrible that the minutes go Terrible that the minutes never go  God make the train start Before they cannot bear it A carper might call Miss Mackay s poems reminiscent for she takes frankly what past languages and literatures have offered to her as our modern composers have not hesitated to take for all their originality the message of the ages She knows her Bible and often flavors her stanzas with a turn from the Litany And we hear the Song of Solomon singing through her lines If her reminiscence is excusable it is because she has something to say The following brief quotation is a fair example of her clear thought White moon of trees and towers Sailing sailing So calm and high You look upon the France of war And the thing of all most cruel Is your peace  A F   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Collected Poems by CondÃ© Benoist Pallen P J Kenedy  and Sons New York  Collected Poems always has a large sound but in this case the book does not reach up to its title The first pages are devoted to The New Rubaiyat written after the mellow pattern of Omar himself Here the author s object appears to be to tell the lusty lunged singer of the vine that neither his song nor his lesson is new and that his argument is false A Fable for Lydia The Death of Sir Launcelot and other long poems follow with here and there a short lyric There are two dramas AglaÃ© and The Feast of Thalarchus All these titles give an idea of the author s range the same lofty themes that have been treated from time immemorial We come upon tritenesses such as earth s sweet acclaim For those of a religious turn of mind this book will be of interest to others it will be dull Two sonnets The Babe are full of charm however and Mr Pallen has two sonnets on the sonnet hardly approaching Rossetti s A sonnet is a moment s monument perhaps but with good thought and poetical lines A F  The Child and Other Verses by Mary Louisa Anderson  Knickerbocker Press New York  The Child which gives this book its title reminds me of the sort of poetry I used to write some ten or more years ago and of the Christ child poems that were written by many others some ten or more years ago Have we advanced beyond or have we receded from those years that this type   Other Books of Verse  seems to have lost its appeal to day But here is a thing that surely moves us Winds in the Marshes with its sweep of freshness also these lines  So walks the wonder up and down Still lovely and unseen In spite of it does it doth and such archaic phrasing  which mar much of this poet s best work such lines as When you white flower of my life Bloom out upon my dream  and others of like fragrance make atonement The book leaves an impression of beauty and sincerity and of power to catch and hold the dream A F  The Christmas Trail and Other Poems by Shirley Harvey Privately printed The Christmas Trail is a little book of college verse by a  likable boy The campus at night tobacco the crying melancholy of youth speculations on death these fill the pages Yet there is an occasional lift to something beyond and a humorous felicity of phrase that give good promise for the future This for instance  Here s to The little poets of little thought and song Who sing so carelessly and jog along Who without thought of critic or of gain Go spattering lyrics like an April rain  E T  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SPECIAL EDITIONS AND TRANSLATIONS  The Sonnets of Shakespeare Variorum Edition edited by  Raymond M Alden Houghton Mifflin Company  With this work the first of the kind in its field Professor Alden of Stanford University makes a scholarly contribution toward the celebration of the Shakespeare tercentenary His book will serve to supplement the Furness variorum edition of the plays indeed it enjoys the countenance of the younger Furness under whom that great enterprise is now continuing  Professor Alden brings together everything that has been written about the Sonnets through two centuries He does not attempt however to blend all these various rays of light into the one white light of truth Are the Sonnets autobiographical or imaginative or esoteric You may decide for yourself How about their proper order with its effect on the story they tell Confusion how much or little let the self confident say How are we to take the dedication those thirty words which have produced more puzzled comment than any equal number of words ever put to paper The data the many arguments pro and con are here and you may form your own conclusion How about the Dark Lady The ghost of Mary Fitton is not yet wholly at peace How about the Rival Poet The Chapman theory while the likeliest has been accepted with decidedly uncritical assurance Who who is Mr W H There is here we quote doubly something sad about working over a vexed problem and getting in the end only nega   Special Editions and Translations  five results But all the materials for treating every vexed point are present so the reader may struggle for himself the editor has listened to all the schools of intepreta tion without having become a proselyte of any  A new era for the study of the Sonnets opened with the examination of the French poets of the half century preceding Shakespeare Mr Alden is somewhat influenced as who would not be by Lee s French Renaissance in England with its demonstration that most of the matter and manner in vogue during the Elizabethan sonnet craze comes straight from Ronsard and his mates of the PlÃ©iade particularly Jodelle and Du Bellay In these men we find the impassioned appeals to a high born patron the warning that youthful beauty will perish utterly unless it propagate itself the promise of enduring fame through poetical celebration and even the denunciation of a false mistress of dark com plexion The consequent view that the Sonnets were written in a kind of competitive following of a lyrical fashion of the Renaissance has naturally been bolstered up by the scientifically minded Germans by Wolff for example But even here our editor saves himself Such critics he feels are too little disposed to realize the extent to which an artificial form may express a real experience and be saturated by personal feeling  And here it may be is the way out Shakespeare happened to be a great poet and a great poet cannot keep up a mere literary exercise through an hundred and fifty four sonnets Grant that he began as the follower of a rather   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  trivial and shallow convention the instrument in hand presently showed itself worthy of better and deeper use Say that our poet with much in his heart and much on his mind and possibly something on his conscience began by splashing and frolicking idly with others on the edge of the vast sea the waves beckoned the waters became deeper and wilder and soon he was involved chin deep or more in a desperate life struggle with real and rending passion a struggle that later made possible Hamlet and Lear and brought him through saved to the reconciling amenities of The Tempest Those who have lived in the Sonnets most deeply will not incline to accept any mechanistic or fictional or mystical mode of accounting for them  The present volume a high credit both to editor and publishers must necessarily become part of every library whose owner accepts Shakespeare as Shakespeare and seeks to understand him H B F The Song of Roland translated by Leonard Bacon Yale  University Press  To the two hundred and ninety two laisses of this ancient literary monument Mr Bacon adds by interpolation a considerable number drawn conscientiously from other sources than the Oxford text Let us proceed at once to Laisse cxxxv in which Roland blows his first blast  The mighty horn Count Roland hath put his lips unto He held it well within them and with all his strength he blew And high are all the summits and oh the way is long But a full fifteen good leagues away they heard it echo strong  This is a fair sample of the style which can hardly be   Special Editions and Translations  said to start a new era in the translation of old epics The translator feels certain that a work like the Song of Roland is susceptible of many interpretations Hence despite the existence of several excellent versions in prose and verse he has not hesitated to attempt one of his own The effort shows much faithful industry but not every reader will feel that it was rewarded H B F  Madonna Dianora A Play in Verse by Hugo von Hof  mannsthal translated from the German by Harriet Betty  Boas Richard G Badger  On the enveloping paper cover of this play we read Madonna Dianora is PellÃ©as and MÃ©lisande set to music Why mar at the outset a book deserving of praise and confidence In the first place PellÃ©as and MÃ©lisande is in itself the very essence of tone In the second place it needs no musical setting other than the exquisite gold of Debussy s opera In the third place how can one play be the musical setting of another play  The translator has brought feeling and art into her English rendering The play alternates prose and blank verse To go back to the suggestion of PellÃ©as and MÃ©lisande as a rule the Germans are matter of fact even in their love and romance therefore Hofmannsthal s work strong though it be lacks the elusive I might say the stealthy quality of Maeterlinck s And how different is Dianora from our shrinking little MÃ©lisande Dianora who could even when seized by the intense horror of approaching death exult in flinging at her husband truth upon truth of her sin   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  This is a terrible little play tense from start to finish We come out of it as from a dark tangle of evil foliage yet there remains to us after the actual images have faded away a haunting sense of beauty and fascination A F  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  I  Mr Samuel McChord Crothers in the October Atlantic  is much concerned over The Gregariousness of the Minor  Poets Not being a poet himself he knows all about it and  dispenses the following pearls of wisdom  He The Poet flourishes in what Milton describes as a pleasing solitariness  A poet does not need other poets to bear him company He sets his face toward the wilderness which he loves and is content with the inspiration which may come  There is nothing more delightful than the discovery of a new poet We are eager to hear a fresh unspoiled voice and to be cheered by a variation on familiar themes He comes with the dew of the morning upon him  It is a sad day for the new poet when he hears the call of his kind The cooperative effort seems to do little for the production of the kind of poetry which the world does not willingly let die  Et cetera Mr Crothers as usual dispenses with amiable  garrulity the familiar platitudes of the stand patter We  advise him to clip the wings of theory and come down to  facts Did Sophocles set his face toward the wilderness he  loved Did Shakespeare did MoliÃ¨re Goethe Cole  ridge Keats Was their art a product of the wilderness  a miracle of isolation or was it in each case merely the Our Contemporaries  highest tree in a forest a climactic product of cooperative effort of the group spirit its sympathies and rivalries Did Dante love the wilderness the spiritual isolation to which his contemporaries condemned him did Heine Burns Blake Is there any proof or indeed any probability that the art of these great men was improved by such isolation an isolation which was indeed in each case far from complete as each one had his few sympathetic admirers  And those Hebrew prophets whom Mr Crothers knows all about they may have gone into the wilderness but did they stay there They came back hot footed to shout to the crowd and quarrel with the prophets of Baal  II  POETRY like all other periodicals and individuals who cherish the right guaranteed by the Constitution of free speech and a free press would enter its emphatic protest against the attempt of the self styled Society for the Suppression of Vice to suppress Theodore Dreiser s novel The Genius one of the most powerful nay formidable efforts of modern art to interpret modern American life  Also POETRY would protest with equal emphasis against influences more insidious and less out spoken which seem to be working for the extinction of The Masses perhaps the most stimulating of all the periodicals which stand for radical thinking in politics sociology and art  A clear path out of all their difficulties to these seekers for truth and beauty who unlike some of their opponents never lack either sincerity or courage   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  III  The Literary Digest of recent date says  Basket ball failed as a drawing card at Brown University when Alfred Noyes was lecturing there on poetry one afternoon The time of the two events coincided and when the manager of the game ran his eyes over the vacant seats he called off the event and went to join the crowd that was listening to Noyes  This is as it should be We may have questioned the propriety of giving Mr Noyes a Princeton professorship but as a reader of ballads from Chevy Chase to Kipling he may be just the man to initiate the sportive undergraduate mind  ANNOUNCEMENT  Under the auspices of this magazine the Chicago Little Theater will give this winter a series of lectures by poets Twelve Talks by Poets on Poetry is the general title of the series which it is to be hoped will stimulate interest in the art through personalities which cannot be exactly conveyed by the written word Each poet will in addition to reading from his or her own poems speak of his method of work and his theories of the art  In the first lecture on November 19th Miss Harriet Monroe presented the historical background of the new movement besides reading from her own poems In the second on November 26th Vachel Lindsay personally explained and illustrated his Poem Games Padraic Colum the Irish poet will speak on December 3rd and Witter Bynner on December 10th Among the other speakers will   Announcement  be Amy Lowell Carl Sandburg Arthur Davison Ficke  Eunice Tietjens Mary Aldis Florence Kiper Frank and  later in the season Wilfrid Wilson Gibson the English poet  The lectures are held at the Little Theater in the Fine
