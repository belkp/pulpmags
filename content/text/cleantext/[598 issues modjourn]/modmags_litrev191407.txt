told its mysteryAs I sit in state in the heart of the worldAs I proudly hug the core of the worldAs I make me a boat of the wholewide world And then for new worlds steerTHE RENAISSANCE OF PARENTHOOD MARGARET CANDERSON THER E seems to be a kind of renaissance of motherhood in the airEllen Key has just done a book with that title which has come to us too late to be reviewed adequately in this issueMrsGasquoine Hartley has written The Age of Mother Power which will be brought out in the falland in Shaw s new volume of playsMisallianceFanny s First Play and The Dark Lady of the Sonnetsthere is a preface of over a hundred pages devoted to a discussion of parents and children which says some of the most refreshing and important things about that relationship I have ever readThe homeas suchis rapidly losing its old functionsperhaps it is more accurate to say that it is changing its standards of functioningand that the present distress merely heralds in a wonderful new conception of family potentialityBut a generalization of this sort can be disputed by any family egotistso let s get down to particularsIt s all right for the enlightened of the older generation to preach violently that the family is a humbugas Shaw doesthat the child should have all the rights of any other human beingand that there is nothing so futile or so stupid as to try tocontrolyour childrenIt s not only all rightit s gloriousBut what I m more interested instill being of the age that must classify asdaughter is thiswhat arethe childrenthemselves doing about itHave their rebellions been anything more than complaints have they made any real stand for liberty have they proved themselves worthy of the Shavian championshipWellI got hold recently of a human document which answered these questions quite in the affirmativeIt was a rather startling thing becausewhile it offered nothing new on the theory side of the matterit showed the theory in thoughtful actionwhichfor all the talk on the subjectis still rareIt was a letter of some twenty pages written by a girl to her mother at the time of a domestic climax when all the bonds of family affectionfamily idealism and obligation were tending to smother the human truth of the situationas the girl put itShe was in her early twentiesshe had a sister two or three years youngerand both of them had reached at least a sort of economic independenceShe had come to the conclusionafter a good many years of rebellion The Little Review 7 that the whole fabric of their family life was wrongand since it was impossible to talk the thing out sensiblybecauseas in all families where the children grow up without being given the necessary revaluationsreal talk is no more possible than it is between uncongenial strangersshe had decided to discuss it in a letterThat medium does away with the patronage of the parentsrefusal to listen seriouslythatOhcome nowwhat do you know about these things If the child has anything interesting to sayif he puts any of his rebellion into his writingthe chances are that the parent will read the letter through and the result is that he ll know more about his child than he has learned in all the years they ve been trying to talk with each other and not succeedingI m enthusiastic about this kind of family correspondenceit s good training in expression and it clears the airjolts theheadsof the family into realizing that the thinking and planning are not all on one sideI once did it myself to my fatherput ten pages of closely written argument on his office deskso that he d open it with the same impersonality given to a business communication in which I explained why I wanted to go away from home and learn to Workand why I thought such a course was an intelligent oneThe letter accomplished what no amount of talking would have donebecause in our talk we rarely got beyond theOhnowyou re just a little excitedit will look different in the morningstageFather said it was rather a shock to him because he didn t know I had ever figured things out to that extent but we always understood each other better after thatHowevernot to get lost in personalitiesthis is the letter the girl showed me and which she allows me to quote from partiallyIf we are to continue living together in any sort of happiness and growth the entire basis of our present life will have to be changedWe can do it if we re brave enough to do what people usually do only in booksface the fact squarely that our family life is and has been a failureand set about to remedy itIt will mean an entire change of home conditionsand these are the terms of the new arrangementWhen I said to you the other day that things would have to go nip way nowyou were horrified at the conceit of itTo get to factsthere s no conceit in itbecause my way is simply the practise of not imposing one s will upon other peopleI made the remark merely as a common sense suggestionand made it out of a seriousness that is desperateI saydesperatebecause I mean that literallythe situation isn t a question of a mere temporary adjustmentjust some sort of superficial arrangement so that we can get on pleasantly for a while before the next outbreak comesThe plans Betty and I have discussed have been made in the interest of our whole future lives8 The Little Review whether we re going to submiteither by surrender or compromise or by just drifting along and not doing anythingto an existence of bickeringnaginghours spent in the discussion of non essentialshideous lack of harmonythe whole stupid programme we ve watched working for years and achieving nothing but unhappinessfollyand a terriblehuman waste You ask us to continue in your waybut from at least three points of view that way has been a failureI ask you to adopt my waywhich has not yet failedThat s why I say it s not conceitbut common senseMy way is simply thisthat we three can live together and work in peace and harmony if this awful bugbear of Authority is dropped out of the schemeEach of us must go her own waywe re all differentand there s no reason why one should impose her authority on the lives of the othersYou say that you should because you re our motherBut that s the thing I want to discussMotherhood isn t infallibilityIf a woman is a wise woman she s a wise motherif she s a foolish woman she s a foolish motherBecause you re our mother doesn t mean that you must always be rightbefore being a mother you re a human beingand any human being is likely to be wrongT o get down to brutal factswe think you are not right about the whole thingWe ve thought so for yearsbut now it s come to the time when our thinking must be put into actionWe re no longer childrenbut even as mere infants we thought these thingswithout having the right to express themWhat I m trying to do now is to express them not as a daughterbut quite impersonally as a human beingas a mere frienda sisteror anyone who might come to you stating that she believed with all her soul that you were wrongand also statingjust as impersonallythat she wouldn t think of modeling her line of conduct after that pattern which appeared to her so wrongW e must face the factsif you do that squarely it doesn t seem so badand you stop flinching about itYou get to the point where you re not afraid to face them boldlyand then you begin to constructAnd this is the only way to clear up the kind of rottenness and decay that flourishes in our family lifeIt s in the interest of this achievement that I say the thing a girl isn t supposed to say to her mothernamelythat Betty and I will not any longer subscribe to the things you expect us toThe fact to face just as quickly as possible is thisit s the starting pointWhen you realize that we feel it s a question of doing this or laying a foundation for lives that are just half liveshideous perverted things which miss all the beauty that you can put into the short life given youI think you ll see how serious we areWe re at least two intelligent human beingsif we re nothing elseAnd why should you ask or expect that we ll submit to a system which to us means stupiditymiserypettinessall those things which we ve seen working out for years and whichbeing at least intelligentwe want to keep away fromThat much settledwe can continue to live together in just one wayas three sisters or friendsthe motherhoodin so far as it means authority or an attempt to mould us to your waymust be eliminatedA complete new family idealism can be built on such a basisYou will say that it s an abnormal basis for any mother to acceptOf course it isbut the situation is abnormaland the orthodox remedies aren t applicableThe reason I say the situation is abnormal is thisusually when a mother objects to her daughtersbehavior it is on some definite basis of opposing the things they dolike going to too many parties or falling in love with the wrong manYou have very little fault to find with the things we doYour objections are on a basis of what we areorratherof what we are notthat we are not orthodoxthat we are not hypocritesthat we are not the kind ofThe Little Reviewdaughters the Victorians approved of Hypocriteswill sound paradoxical but you have confessed that y o u w o u l d rather have us lie to y o u than to disagreewith y o u that y o u w o u l d rather have us b e sentimental aboutthe waya girl should treat her motherthan to learn h o w w e ought to treat ourselves Y o u call that beingrespectfuland think that harmony is possible only undersuch conditionsWe call it beinginsulting and think that it s the one sureway of destroying any chance of harmonyIf w e respect y o u it must be becausewe think y o u worthy of the truthanything else is degrading to bothsides Y o u l l say y o u can t be satisfied to live with us and not give a d v i c e andall the other things that are part of a mother s dutyYou may give all theadvice y o u want t o the keynote of the new situation will b e that w e l l take theadvice if w e believe it s rightif not we ll ignore itjust as a man ignores hisfriend s advice when he feels it to be wrongOf course the wise persondoesn t give much a d v i c e he simply lives his life the best way he knows how That s the only bid he can make for emulationIf w e tell you that we don ta p p r o v e of the creed you have made you mustn t be surprised if we try toformulate one of our ownThere s no reason for us to ask you to changejust because w e r e your daughtersYou must d o as y o u believeBut youmust grant us the same privilege We disagree about fundamentalsIf our beliefs were merely the vague unformed ideas of children you might try to change themBut it s t o o latenowSo w e can live together harmoniously only if we give up the foolishattempts atinfluencingW e r e not living three generations agoW e v e had Shaw since then and parents and children aren t doing the insulting things to each other theyused to d o Among intelligent p e o p l e some of the o l d issues can never raisetheir heads againAnd soit s for y o u to decidewhether we shall build onthe new foundation together or separately It might be a playit s certainly rather good for realityAndwhat happenedThe mother refused toaccept the terms which isnot surprisingperhapsand the household broke up into two establishmentswith results that will disappoint the conservative who thinksthose girls should have been soundly beatenThe first wrench of it the girl saidreminded her of George s parting with Marion in Tono Bungay that sense of belonging to each other immenselythatprofoundpersuasion of irreparable errorin the midst of what seemedprofoundly right Nothing is simple Wells wrote in that connectionevery wrong done has a certain justice in itand every gooddeed has dregs of evil But the girl and her mother have learned to befriends as a result of that breakand the latter will tell you n ow thatit was the right thing to have done The preface to Misalliance has such a wealth of quotable thingsin it that the only way to get them appreciated is to quoteShaw hassaid much of this beforebut it is all so valuable that it ought to beshouted from the housetopsThe Little Review The people against whom children are wholly unprotected are those who devote themselves to the very mischievous and cruel sort of abortion which is called bringing up a child in the way it should goNow nobody knows the way a child should goWhat is a childAn experimentA fresh attempt to produce the just man made perfectthat isto make humanity divineAnd you will vitiate the experiment if you make the slightest attempt to abort it into some fancy figure of your ownfor exampleyour notion of a good man or a womanly womanIf you treat it as a little wild beast to be tamedor as a pet to be played withor even as a means to save you trouble and to make money for youand these are our commonest ways it may fight its way through in spite of you and save its soul alivefor all its instincts will resist youand possibly be strengthened in the resistancebut if you begin with its own holiest aspirationsand suborn them for your own purposesthen there is hardly any limit to the mischief you may doFrancis Place tells us that his father always struck his children when he found one within his reachFrancis records the habit with bitternesshaving reason to thank his stars that his father respected the inside of his head whilst cuffing the outside of itand this made it easy for Francis to do yeoman s service to his country as that rare and admirable thinga Freethinkerthe only sort of thinkerI may remarkwhose thoughtsand consequently whose religious convictionscommand any respectNow MrPlaceseniorwould be described by many as a bad fatherand I do not contend that he was a conspicuously good oneBut as compared with the conventionally good father who deliberately imposes himself on his son as godwho takes advantage of childish credulity and parent worship to persuade his son that what he approves of is right and what he disapproves of is wrongwho imposes a corresponding conduct on the child by a system of prohibitions and penaltiesrewards and eulogiesfor which he claims divine sanctioncompared to this sort of abortionist and monster makerI sayPlace appears almost as a ProvidenceA gentleman once wrote to me and saidwith an obvious conviction that he was being most reasonable and high mindedthat the only thing he beat his children for was failure in perfect obedience and perfect truthfulnessOn these attributeshe saidhe must insistAs one of them is not a virtue at alland the other is the attribute of a godone can imagine what the lives of this gentleman s children would have been if it had been possible for him to live down to his monstrous and foolish pretentionsThe crueltyof beating a childmust be whitewashed by a moral excuseand a pretense of reluctanceIt must be for the child s goodThe assailant must sayThis hurts me more than it hurts you There must be hypocrisy as well as crueltyThe most excusable parents are those who try to correct their own faults in their offspringThe parent who says to his child I am one of the successes of the Almightytherefore imitate me in every particular or I will have the skin off your back a quite common attitudeis a much more absurd figure than the man whowith a pipe in his mouththrashes his boy for smokingIf you must hold yourself up to your children as an object lessonwhich is not at all necessary hold yourself up as a warning and not as an exampleBut you had much better let the child s character aloneIf you once allow yourself to regard a child as so much material for you to manufacture into any shape that happens to suit your fancy you are defeating the experiment of theThe Little Review 11 Life ForceYou are assuming that the child does not know its own businessand that you doIn this you are sure to be wrongThe child feels the drive of the Life Forceoften called the Will of God and you cannot feel it for himMost children can beand many arehopelessly warped and wasted by parents who are ignorant and silly enough to suppose that they know what a human being ought to beand who stick at nothing in their determination to force their children into their mouldsExperienced parentswhen children s rights are preached to themvery naturally ask whether children are to be allowed to do what they likeThe best reply is to ask whether adults are to be allowed to do what they likeThe two cases are the sameThe adult who is nasty is not allowed to do what he likesneither can the child who likes to be nastyThere is no difference in principle between the rights of a child and those of an adultthe difference in their cases is one of circumstanceMost working folk today either send their children to day schools or turn them out of doorsThis solves the problem for the parentsIt does not solve it for the childrenany more than the tethering of a goat in the field or the chasing of an unlicensed dog in the streets solves it for the goat or the dogbut it shows that in no class are people willing to endure the society of their childrenand consequently it is an error to believe that the family provides children with edifying adult societyor that the family is a social unitThe family is in thatas in so many other respectsa humbugOld people and young people cannot walk at the same pace without distress and final loss of health to one of the partiesAnd since our system is nevertheless to pack them all into the same house and pretend that they are happyand that this particular sort of happiness is the foundation of virtueit is found that in discussing family life we never speak of actual adults or actual childrenor of realities of any sortbut always of ideals such as The Homea Mother s Influencea Father s CareFilial PietyDutyAffectionFamily Lifeetc etc which are no doubt very comforting phrasesbut which beg the question of what a home and a mother s influence and a father s care and so forth really come toWomen who cannot bear to be separated from their pet dogs send their children to boarding school cheerfullyThey may say and even believe that in allowing their children to leave home they are sacrificing themselves for their children s goodBut to allege that children are better continually away from home is to give up the whole popular sentimental theory of the familyIf you compel an adult and a child to live in one another s company either the adult or the child will be miserableThere is nothing whatever unnatural or wrong or shocking in this factand there is no harm in it if only it be sensibly faced and provided forThe mischief that it does at present is produced by our efforts to ignore itor to smother it under a heap of sentimental and false pretencesThe child s rightsbeing clearly those of any other human beingare summed up in the right to liveAnd the rights of society over it clearly extend to requiring it to qualify itself to live in society without wasting other people s timeW e must reconcile education with libertyW e must find out some means of making men workers andif need bewarriorswithout making them slavesIn dealing with children what is needed is not logic but sense The Little Review A child should begin to assert itself earlyand shift for itself more and more not only in washing and dressing itselfbut in opinions and conductAnd what is a tyrantQuite simply a person who says to another personyoung or old You shall do as I tell you Children are extremely cruel without intending itand in ninety nine cases out of a hundred the reason is that they do not conceive their elders as having any human feelingServe the elders rightperhapsfor posing as superhumanThe penalty of the imposter is not that he is found outhe very seldom isbut that he is taken for what he pretends to be and treated as suchThe family ideal is a humbug and a nuisanceone might as reasonably talk of the barrack idealor the forecastle idealor any other substitution of the machinery of social for the end of itwhich must always be the fullest and most capable lifein shortthe most Godly lifeEven apart from its insufferable pretensionsthe family needs hearty discreditingfor there is hardly any vulnerable part of it that could not be amputated with advantageDo not for a moment suppose that uncultivated people are merely indifferent to high and noble qualitiesThey hate them malignantlyWhether the risks to which liberty exposes us are moral or physical our right to liberty involves the right to run themA man who is not free to risk his neck as an aviator or his soul as a heretic is not free at alland the right to liberty beginsnot at the age of 2 1 yearsbut of 2 1 secondsYou may have as much fun at Shaw s expense as you want on the grounds that he has never had to train a child and therefore doesn t know the difficultiesBut if you want to laugh last don t read this preface or the play that follows itbecause he will make a laughingstock or a convert of you as surely as he will prove that he is far cleverer than you can ever hope to beShaw and Ellen Key preach practically the same doctrine about the homeboth are temperamentally incapable of Charlotte Perkins Gilman s programmeeducation outside the homeShaw because the school is as big a humbug as the familyand Miss Key becauseeven if institutions can thus rough plane the material that is to become a member of societynevertheless they cannotif they take in the major part of the child s educationaccomplish that which is needed first of all if we are to lift ourselves to a higher spiritual plane in an economically just societythey cannot deepen the emotional life Her insistence is strongly upon the education of the feelings as the most important factor in the soul lifeIn her vision of the renaissance of motherhood she begins with Nietzsche s dictum thata time will come when men will think of nothing except education Not that any one can be educated to motherlinessbut that our sentimentalization of motherhood as the ever holyever infallible powermust be aban The Little Review 13 donedand a quality of intelligent mother power cultivated by definite courses of training which she lays out in detailIn view of the number of homes I know of that come legitimately under the Shaw denunciation I feel sometimes that any socialization of home life is more hopeful than an attempt to remodel the hopeless conditions inside the homeRegard the parents you knowthe great mass of them outside the exceptions that encourage you to believe spasmodically in the beauty and noble need of parenthoodIf they are not cruel or stupid or ignorant or smug or righteous or tyrannical or dishonest or unimaginative or weak or quiet ineffectualthey are something else just as badIt has come to the point where a good parent is as hard to find as an honest manVery seriouslyhoweverthere is hope in the situationthere is renaissance in the airAnd it has its foundation in the sensible and healthythough so far only tacitadmission that it doesn t matter so much what your child becomes as that he shall become somethingYou can t do much with himanyhowand you may as well face itYou can give himduring his first few yearsthe kind of foundation you think will help him and for the rest of the time you can do only one thing that he will really need from youyou can develop your own personality as richly as you want him to develop hisYou can refuse to worry about himsince that does neither of you any goodand thereby save stores of energy that he may draw upon for your mutual benefitIt becomes a sort of game for twoinstead of the uninteresting kind in which one player is given all the advantagesCompared with it the old fashioned game in which the mother sacrificed everythingsuffered everythingwore herself out trying to help her child winlooks not only very unfair and very unnecessarybut very wastefulAnd have you ever noticed how the man who sentimentalizes about the wonderful mothers we used to havehis own in particularis the one whose life is lived at the opposite pole of the mother s wise directionIf you disagree with all thisthere is still one other method by which you may produce a child who will be a credit to himslf and to societyYou may be so utterly stupid and wrong headed that he will rebel to the point of becoming something differentIf you prefer this course no one need worry much about your childbecause he ll probably found a system of child education that will cause him to be famousand if you have a daughtershe ll probably become a Montessori The Little Review The new home is a recognition that the child is not the only factor in society that needs educatingIt assumes that no one s education is finished just because he s been made a parentIt means that we can all go on being educated togetherIt means the elimination of all kinds of domestic folliesfor onethe ghastly embarrassment of growing up to discover that you re different from the rest of your familyand for that reason something of a criminalIt means the kind of understanding that develops a child s feeling instead of suppressing itso that he won t be ashamedfor instanceof having such glorious things as dreams and visionsIt means artistic educationand Shaw says that we all grow up stupid or mad to just the extent to which we have not been artistically educatedTHE SWAN Under the lily shadow and the gold and the blue and mauve that the whin and the lilac pour down on the waterthe fishes quiverOver the

there included are not true16 The Little Review ImagistsThese are CournosHuefferUpwardJoyceand CannellMrAldington says he doesn t mean that these poems are not beautifulon the contraryhe admires them immenselybut they are not strictly speaking Imagist poemsI agree that the poems of these five men are beautifulespecially the I hear an army of James Joyce and the Nocturnes of Skipwith Cannelland I also maintain thatall unconsciouslythe publishers of The Glebe have dealt a deadly blow to sectarian Imagism by including these non Imagist poems in their anthologyBecauseunless a school can prove that it alone has that unnameable wonder which excites us to deepest emotional turmoiland which we call poetryit has but little right to isolate itself or to separate its adepts from the bulk of

that s how it isI think them all poetsThe Imagists believe in the direct presentation of emotionpreferably in terms of objectivityThey abhor an excess of adjectivesandafter a satiety of the pompous Victorian stuffI am much inclined to sympathize with that tenet of their faithI wishhoweverto make clear my own positionwhich is the one that most counts when I am writingI am an anarchist in poetry I

certain right of privacyI am not sure that we do well in writing so much of their personalities and their individual views of lifeWhen we read a poemwe feel a temperament behind itbut the effort to catalogue and label that mind and itsmessageis a little impertinentand very futileMrRupert Brooke is an excellent illustrationHis fondness for this or thatwhether in landscapefoodideasor moralsis hardly our concernHe deserves to be treated not as a natural history specimena peculiar group of likes and dislikes and convictionsbut as an artistMrBrooke has the distinctionrare for a young poetof not having written any bad verseor of not having printed itHis sole volumePoemsSidgwick and JacksonLondon1913 manifests in even its least notable pieces a creative spirit not allowed to run riotbut chastened and restrained by a keen sense of the obscure laws whose workings turn passion into a decorative patternand the emotions of the blood into intelligible designs 18 The Little Review Unless one is deeply concerned with such thingsone is not likely to recognize the fundamental difference between those poets whose work is merely a more or less interesting emotional cryand those nobler and more mature poets in whose work the crude elements of emotion are subordinated to the exegencies of an artistic conceptionOnly the latter have written fine poetryThe former may move usas a crying child may move usbut they cannot exalt us to a peak that rises above the region of mere sympathetic responseThey can never bring us a wind of revelationor a flame from beyond the worldThey are never the poets to whom other poetsand these are the only final judgesturn for inspiration or for fellowshipFor after allthere is no magic in any theme or in the emotion behind itwhat is magical lies wholly in the designthe mouldin which the poet embodies a feeling that is probably common to allNo thought is so profoundno intimation so subtlethat it alone suffices as the stuff of poetryBut any thoughtany intimationif it be justly correlated and moulded into an organic and expressive shapewill serve to awaken echoes of a forgotten or unknown lovelinessand pierce its way into the very soul of the listenerThis sense of design of which I speak is not a hardformalconscious thing in the mind of the poetbut rather a carefully trained instinctlike the instinct that guides the hand of a fine draughtsman in the drawing of a curve of unexpected beautyThere is a right place to begin the curveand a right place to end itand at every instant of its length it is swayed and governed by a sense of relation to preceding and succeeding momentsa sense subject to laws that defy mathematical formulationbut are perilously definite neverthelessThis sense of control is a rare thing to find in the work of so young a man as MrBrookeMost young writers seem to approach their work as an unrestrained expression of themselveswhich it should bebut they forget thatfor real self expressionthe most scrupulous mastery of the medium of expression is necessaryThey regard the writing of verse as something in the nature of a joy ride with an open throttleinstead of seeing in it a piece of difficult drivingto be achieved only by the use of every subtlety of modulated speed and controlled steering that the mind is capable of employingThat MrBrooke needs no such warninglet the following fine sonnet bear witness The Little Review 19 SUCCESS I think if you had loved me when I wantedIf I d looked up one dayand seen your eyesAnd found my wild sick blasphemous prayer grantedAnd your brown facethat s full of pity and wiseFlushed suddenlythe white godhead in new fear Intollerably so strugglingand so shamedMost holy and farif you d come all too nearIf earth had seen Earth s lordliest wild limbs tamedShakenand trappedand shiveringfor my touchMyself should I have slainor that foul youBut this the strange godswho had given so muchTo have seen and known youthis they might not doOne last shame s spared meone black word s unspokenAnd I m aloneand you have not awokenIt is significant that for his sonnets MrBrooke frequently chooses the Shakesperian forma form whichstrangelyEnglish poets have generally for at least a century discarded in favor of the Petrarchan modelThe common feeling appears to be that the Petrarchana bb aa b b ac d e c d e or some variation on that schemeis musical and emotionaland that the Shakesperiana b a bc d c de f e fg gis harshcoldmechanicaland incapable of subtle harmoniesThe exact reverse of this is the caseIt is perhaps too much to ask the reader to write a sequence of a hundred sonnets in each formas a testbut I am confident that after such an experiencehe would agree with meThe Petrarchan form is capable of only one successful effecta rising on the crest of a wavewhose summit is the end of the eighth lineand a subsidence of the wavein the course of the last six linesThe Shakesperian formon the other handis capable of a literally infinite variety of effectsno pattern is set arbitrarily in advancebutas in blank verseany pattern may be createdThe first twelve lineswhich are nothing but three quatrainscan be moulded into a contour that fits any shape or size of thought whatsoeverand the couplet at the enda device despised by the ignorantmay be used either to clinch the purport of the preceding twelve linesor to blend with themor startlingly to refute themor to serve any other end that the genius of the writer is capable of imaginingThe mere novice will like this form because of its simple rhyme scheme and its superficial ease of workingthe experienced amateur will prefer the Petrarchan form becausewhile the more complex rhyme scheme presents for him no difficultiesthe basic inadequacies of his thought structure are fairly well concealed by the arbitrary sonnet structurebut the master of imagination and expression is likely to follow Shakespere and the novice in preferring the true English formwherein he can with perfect freedom create a subtly modulated movement that will answer to every sway and leap of his thoughtMrBrookewhose sense of form is keenis one of those who can safely and wisely try the more interesting and more dangerous mediumI have thought it worth while to talk a good deal of the sonnet in connection with MrBrooke for the reason that several of his very finest pieces are in this formThe following is one that stands a good chance of being in the anthologies a hundred years from nowTHE HILL Breathlesswe flung us on the windy hillin the sunand kissed the lovely grasssaid Through glory and ecstasy we passsunand earth remainthe birds sing stillwe are oldare old And when we die over that is oursand life burns on other loversother lips said Iof my heartour heaven is nowis won W e are Earth s bestthat learnt her lesson hereis our cryWe have kept the faith we saidshall go down with unreluctant tread into the darkness Proud we werelaughedthat had such bravetrue things to sayd then you suddenly criedand turned away Perhaps as magical as any of MrBrookes work is a longer poem called The Fisha remarkable and original piece of fantasy that makes the sub aqueous universe vivid and real to the senses of the readerand opens to him a new world of imaginative experienceEven the opening lines will serve to indicate something of the curious trance qualityIn a cool curving world he lies An d ripples with dark ecstasiesThe kind luxurious lapse and steal Shapes all his universe to feel And know and bethe clinging stream Closes his memoryglooms his dreamWh o lips the roots othe shoreand glides Superb on unreturning tidesThe Little Review 21 In other of these poemsone is struck by MrBrooke s passion for uglinessHe loves to take the most hideous and base facts of life and give them a place in his work alongside the things of beautyIt would be hard to find anything more humorous and at the same time more repulsive than thisWAGNER Creeps in half wantonhalf asleepOne with a fat wide hairless faceHe likes love music that is cheapLikes women in a crowded placeAn d wants to hear the noise they re makingHis heavy eyelids droop half overGreat pouches swing beneath his eyesHe listensthinks himself the loverHeaves from his stomach wheezy sighsHe likes to feel his heart s a breakingThe music swellsHis gross legs quiverHis little lips are bright with slimeThe music swellsThe women shiverAn d all the whilein perfect time His pendulous stomach hangs a shakingNowa passion for ugliness like this is really a revolt against uglinessnot the tender skinned esthete s revoltwhich consists in denying ugliness and escaping into a remote dreambut the strong man sthe poet sthe revolt that is in effect a siezing of ugliness in all its repulsiveness and giving it a reason for existence by embodying it in a chosen pattern that is beautifulBy this method the poet masters emotioneven unpleasant emotionmaking it subservient to a decorative design dictated by his own sense of proportionIt is thus that he is able to endure the world of actualitiesand to find it comparable in interest with the world of his own thoughtsAnd by this process he saves himself from the sharpest bite of evilFor there is a curious consolation in transforming a spontaneous cry into a calculated work of artBy such a process one can giveto elements that before seemed only parts of a torturing chaostheir ordered places in a known schemeOne can impose propitious form upon one s recollectionsand create a little world of design relations where the poignancy of experience is lost in the discipline of beautyIt is for this reason that the poet must be consideredin spite of everythingthe happiest of men 22 The Little Review THE NEW LOYALTY GEORGE BURMAN FOSTER BACK to the Old Greek for a starting point Two seedsof the same speciesthough distant in space and timego through an identical developmentRoot corresponds with rootstem with stemflower with flowerfruit with fruitSomething seems to control all this changeIt is not mere changeIt is change with a plana purposea patternHence the Greek said that there must be an unchanging typea fixedidea a spiritualinvisible

everythingAn elaboration of this conclusion gives the real unchangingfixed eternal world back ofunderpinningsupporting this visible changingtemporal worldSuch a world view as this was made more valuable and more imperative by the break up of the traditional morals and religion of the Greek stateThe search for the meaning of life was precipitated by the disintegration of social sanctions and of the guarantees of customThis search was voiced in the questionings of SocratesIt was made serious by the menacing individualism of the sophistsThe outcome was that stabilitysecurityconfidence were found in the Platonic doctrineBack of this ephemeral world is the real world ofideas the unchanging and eternalupon which we may rest our minds and hearts amid all this disappointing and desperate fluxPassing by the Middle Ageswhichmutatis matandisappropriated this schemewe pause over the significance of the Renaissance periodTwo things are uppermost in one s mind and as one thinks of the tumultuous beginnings of modern life which characterized the fourteenthfifteenthand sixteenth centuriesFor one thingthe Renaissance was the culmination of a long period of absorption in which men had been gradually working their way backby intellectual assimilationtowards the beginnings of the rich tradition which Church and Empire had stored upThis period of absorption was that five hundred years during which pagan hordes that had conquered RomeThe Little Review were conquered by the knowledgefaithcustomcivilization of their victimsFrom the cultural standpoint the new nations were hungrythe larder of the old civilization was repleteand hence authority on one side and absorption on the other became natural and inevitable Thusthe philosophical preconceptionsthe cosmological ground principlesthe whole general attitude toward life s problems of the whole old world were fastened upon the mind of the young European peoplesIt must not be forgotten that all this was aat the hatural achievement of the new European life and geniusbut as foreign to itas inheritedand at first as cherishedas grandfatherly ideas are in the mind of a childIf some day the child must shake off the old conceptions because he hears the call of life to go forth and achieve his own inner worldit would be only natural to expect that this young European giant should some day struggle to cast aside his intellectual inheritance and go forth to conquer reality for himselfin his own waywith his own weaponsWelland this is the second matterit was just that very thing that was happening in the earlyteensof our eraThe young western world began to look at life for itselfand a curiousastonishedwild eyed look it wasEurope had learned at its mother s knee to say The true world is fixed and finalReality is static But looking out now in wondermentseeing farther than the ancient world had ever seenthe new world said AhnoThe world is not staticThe world movesThings change Two well known anecdotes are told of Galileowhichif not authenticare well inventedThe one tells howin the dome at Pisa during worshipthe litany or the sermon boring himhe observed the cathedral chandelier move by the wind andstudying its vibrationsdiscovered a basic law of mechanicsThe profound meaning of this anecdote isobviouslythat God spoke to the man more effectively through the self moving pendulum than in the rigidimmobile litany from a rigidimmobilehieratic heartand thatif we do not understand such litanyand it bores uswe may still devoutly worship by meditating upon what we can understandThe other narrative tells howimprisonedtortured inwardly by a compulsory recantationGalileo gathered himself together and declared E pu se muoveit moves thoughGalileo never uttered these wordsbut the history of the world has uttered them for him Yesit moves itselfthis earthand in its motion it knocks everything down that is in its wayNot the earth alone movesall that is in the world is eternal motionMan movesin spaceand timeextensively and intensivelyTruth movesandmovingdemolishes thrones and altarsMorality movesmaking ancient good uncouthFaith movesthe human heart putting into it the pulse beat of its lifeand there is no way to stop this self moving FaithThose old stories are not true to factbut they are true to truthGalileo did say It is my opinion that the earth is very noble and admirable by reason of so many and so different generations and alterations which are incessantly made therein And Descartes joined him The nature of things physical is much more easily conceived when they are beheld coming gradually into existencethan when they are only considered as produced at once in a finished and perfect state Thus these menand many othersvoiced the changed temper that was coming over the worldthe transfer of interest from the permanent to the changingSlowly the new attitude was adopted in many departments of knowledgebut the facts of biology were apparently all against its becoming a general philosophical movementThe species of plants and animals had every appearance of being fixed and finalunchangeably stamped once for all upon the sentient world by the CreatorNot only sobut the wonderful adaptation of organism to environmentof organ to organisma marvelous and delicate complexity of teleological adjustmentseemed to testify unanswerably to the reality of fixed and final typesto a static underpinning for all this changing orderOrigin of SpeciesThat was the bomb with which Charles Darwin destroyed the last stronghold of a static world view Speciesis the scholasticstranslation of the Greek Eidosthe fixed and final type or idea which is first and final cause of the changing life of each creatureSpecies is a synomym and epitome of fixity and finalityit is the key word of a static other world realityWhen Darwin said Origin of Species he was cramming the conflict of the ancient wisdom and the modern knowledge into a bursting phraseWhen he said of species what Galileo said of the earthe pu se muovehe emancipated once for all genetic and experimental ideas as an organon of asking questions and looking for explanationsHe lifted the biological gates which had kept back the flood of change from inundating the old fields of fixityIn sumThe world of thought is slowlypainfully making a change in its fundamental attitude toward reality such as is not made oftener than once in several millenniaOne general conception of reality was all controling for 2 000 yearsThen from Copurnicus to Darwin many factors in a world subversive change were struggling for recognitionConceptions that had reigned in the philosophy of nature and of knowledge for 2 000 years rested in the superiority of the fixed and finalthey rested on treating change and origin as signs of defect and unrealityIn laying hands upon the sacred ark of absolute permanencyin treating forms that had been regarded as types of fixity and perfection as originating and passing awaytheorigin of speciesintroduced a mode of thinking that in the end was bound to transform the logic of knowledgeand hence the treatment of all our values and verities and virtuesBut heaven and earth and species are not allShall there be no Copernicus of the moral heavensno Galileo of the moral earthno Darwin of the moral lifeHove now Friedrich Nietzsche into sightLoyalty has ever been the

way tomorrow 26 The Little Review And this preaching of Nietzsche s on the duty of change as against the old duty to change never has found more ears to listen and more hearts to believe than any other preaching of our timeThis new preaching is at once most influential and most dangerousBut its very dangerousness is a most wholesome and necessary part of the modern moral view of lifeIs loyaltythensomething about which there is nothing to be learnedIs there no counterfeit and caricature of loyaltyNo mask behind which men hide their indolence and complacency and thoughtlessnessYou meet a man whom you have not seen in long yearsand you say to him Whyyou have not changed a bityou are precisely the same as in the old days Have you praised himnecessarilyIf he left you as a childlooking and speaking and thinking and acting like a childought he not to have changedDoes a fruit remain what it was as bud and blossomLife is developmentbut development is a constant self changingDevelopment is an incessant dis loyalty to what is already thereAnd if manjust because he is manand has a will of his own and can set himself against the law of developmentshould sell his life to the force of inertiawould not that be a crime against lifeAnd yeteven such a deed men call loyaltyMen say that they want to be faithful to the heritage of the fathersWhich is often enough simply to say that they mean to store away their heritage where it will be kept from the world s light and air that would destroy itbut wherealsoit can enter into no human intercourseserve no lifefulfil no end of lifeThis loyalty of unchangeableness to the heritage puts the talent in a napkinand there can be no increaseMen say that they mean to abide faithful to their faith unto deathOften enough this is only stubbornness and narrownessIt requires no art and no merit to exercise such faithfulnessAll one needs to do is to close one s eyes and ears to what lies beyond the bounds of this faithto forego the questionings and uncertainties that others must pass throughand then to send in one s claim to the reward and gratitude due such loyaltyToday it is quite the thing at college commencements to spy out the men who are models of such loyalty and to say Look how firm and steadfast and rock like they are But it cannot be denied that much of this illustrious loyalty is nothing but natural or voluntary incapacity to think more widely than others have taught them to thinkorfor theThe Little Review matter of thatpermitted them to thinkBack of this bragging about principles which are vainly declared to be unshakablethere is frequently nothing but an ill natured obstinacy whose so called principles have no other basis than the self interest to which they are con tributaryIt was this loyalty to the finishedfinished cultfinished belieffinished customs and practicesfinished religion and morality that stoned the prophets and crucified JesusIt was this kind of loyalty that the mediaeval church imposed upon theFaithful imprisoning the conscience therein for time and for eternityBound by an oath of loyaltythe priest renounced the worldthe monk and nun under monastic vows dedicated their lives to the churchtheir services toheaven And hence it marked an epoch when Luther called their loyalty a sinand went forth into the worldthe homethe vocationthe businessbreaking the vows of priest and cloisterWas such disloyalty to a sacred obligation loyalty in the sixteenth centuryand shall it be blasphemy in the twentiethIs it not rather a blasphemy to preach to men a loyalty which obligates them to forego the use of their best and noblest powerswhich condemns them to spiritual standstill in the eternal progressive movement of lifeTake some illustrations which will test insight and courageThere is the constitution of the United StatesShall we assume toward it the loyalty of fixedness and finalityor the loyalty of changeNo man of veneration and equipoise would favor capricious or precipitate or superfluous change in so noble a documentButfor all thatthe experience of life made the constitution for life s sakeand the maker is more than the madeIf our national life passas pass it hasinto new seas and under new starswhere life needs a change of the constitutionthen the principle which prompted the people to frame the constitution in the first place requires them to change it to meet the new needs of our growing and changing national lifeThe superficial loyalty to the changeless letter must yield to the profound loyalty to the ever changing spiritThe constitution is for the sake of the peoplenot the people for the sake of the constitutionTheyrather than itare sacredSimilarlythere is the modern problem of marriagethe familyand the homeShall ours be the old loyalty that holds the customs of the past inviolablemarriage indissolublethe inherited patterns of home and family unchangeablethe loyalty of fixedness and finishednessor shall it be the loyalty of change in all these matters to meet the changing needs and situations of our burdened and bewildered modernityAgainno man of sanctity and sanity and stability of soul can favor any arbitrary radicalism that is subversive of time honored institutions for no better reason than a fleeting fancyor the passing of the romance of the honeymoonor raw self willor an unanticipated burden or hardshipButfor all thatthe marriage institutionlike all othersis for the sake of man and not man for the sake of the institutionIt was life that originated our domestic ideas and customs and conventions and codesand if ever lifein the interest of its well being and progressrequires changes suited to new needs and new daysthen thenew loyaltyto life that ever changes must replace the old loyalty to codes that never changeCodestooare for the sake of lifenot life for the sake of codesNo loyalty to the letter that means disloyalty to the spiritAnd there is the everlasting problem of educationEducation in the past had for its subject matter symbolsreadingwritingarithmeticgrammarrhetoriclogicand the likeThe new education has for its subject matter realitiesnature and historyThe old education taught topics or subjectsthe new education teaches boys and girlsAccording to the old educationknowledge precedes actionaccording to the new educationaction precedes knowledgeIn the old

education was atomisticthe new organicThe old education was a donation to the pupilsthe new is an achievement by themThe old education proceeded on the assumption that man is primarily intellectthe new that he is primarily willThe old education preceded life and fitted for itthe new education is a part of life itselfIt is a great changeAccording to the old theorythere was perfection to start withperfection at the topAll that we needed was to pipe it down through aqueducts so well constructed that nothing that was in could get outnothing that was without could get in The Little Review 29 and thusthus onlywould the vain and empty world and life be filled with value and verity and virtuedonation on the one sidereception on the otherBut the time came when men askedif there is perfection

turned upside downThe new theory holds that matters began very humbly and struggled and fought their way slowly upwardAscent from belownot descent from aboveNo values or verities or virtues donatedall

initiativespontaneityfreedomThat is their prerogativeas it was of the king of oldThey need the mechanicalthe automaticthe impersonal in manThis fits into their worldThis is what the old education stands forThe new education unfolds and matures personalitiesPersonalities make good masters but poor servantsBusiness men as a class are perhaps our best menBut the very conditions of business economy and certainty are the impersonalthe unfreethe mechanicalSo business has warped the judgment of some good men and led them astray on the most fundamental problem in the history of the raceWere it not multiplying illustrationsthe same point might be urged as to politicsDoes not party loyalty often mean personal servilityAs a matter of fact what is loyalty in one situationor one agemay be simple cowardice or abjectness in anotherThe upshot is that the modern man has to endure the reproach of not thinking and feeling and judging and acting as men formerly didthe reproach of perfidy toward the pastits solutions and its sanctitiesIn consequenceit would not be a bad idea for him to cultivate respect for the pastgratitude for its achievementsappreciation for its unfinished tasksStillhe should learn to accept the reproach as praise recognition thatthough problems remain the samesolutions changethough sanctity abidethe objects which are sacred changeEvolutionism no longer recognizes any fact as sacredMan is inwardly working on ever fartherever overcoming the old and conquering ever the newthis must also be recognizedIt is said that we ought to love the oldthe finishedBut is love blindDoes it consist in advocating the point of view of one s friendnot because it seems truebut just because love requires itIs loyalty of love the faculty of adaptation with which we remodel ourselves after the image of anotherIs one disloyal in love if one affirm one s self against anotheror if another affirm himself against oneSurely fidelity of friendshipeven of marriageought not to be the grave of one s own beingSurely loyalty should be the life and not the death of one s selfSurely we must all see with our own eyeshear with our own earsjudge with our own judgmentslove with our own heartsfor the quite plain reason that we have no others with which we can do these thingsAnd soif we take up this great subject in a large wayas Nietzsche has donewe see that we have all broken with the old loyaltyand that the consummation of this breach has been life and blessing to usWe moderns all somehow live in a disloyalty which we have committedimputed to us as transgressionviewed by us as our strength and prideWe have all become unfaithfulas children to our parentsas pupils to our teachersas disciples to our mastersWe felt ourselves bound to themwe loosed ourselves from themThe paths they walked we have forsakenIn the strange untrodden land whither our vagrant feet have wanderedwecame to ourselvesin declaring disobedience to the laws of traditionin breaking loyalty to the rules of the schoolsIt is precisely on this account that once again we have won spiritual lifea living art and sciencea living religion and moralityW e have snapped the fetters fastened upon us in the name of the old loyaltyand all that is great and fruitful and constructive in the life of the modern spirit is a monument of the disloyalty which its creators have built theretoNothing is gained any longer by our screening ourselves behind this word loyaltyand making believe that we shall not be found outWe owe it to ourselves and we owe it to the world to confess frankly that we have done with the old loyalty to the unchangeable and the finishedfor that is to be loyal to an unrealitysince there is no such thingEven Godif he be the living Godcannot be the same yesterdaytodayand foreverBut we owe it even more to ourselves and to the world to strive for a clear position in reference to this question which is soThe Little Review 31 profoundly agitating our entire moral world todayW e may not abandon the field to those who would demolish the temple of the old goddess simply that they may celebrate upon its ruins the orgies of their caprice and inconstancy and characterlessnessIf ever there was a doctrine whose right is easily turned into a wrongwhose truth into an errorwhose blessing into a curseit is this Nietzschean doctrine of the right and the duty of ceaseless changeof self dependenceby which we are redeemed from slavery to the pastIf the old loyalty loyalty to the pastno longer holds menwherewith shall they be heldShall they be like the weathervane blown hither and thither by every wind of doctrineor like the rudderless ship driven aimless and planless over the high seas by the midnight hurricaneBetter a thousand times be tethered to the old loyalty than to be doomed to such a life of levity and poiselessness and flightinessBut the new loyalty which we seekwithout which we go forward into no futureshould it not be more stable and enduring and loyal than the oldIf a moment releases itself from what to it is pastand validates its right as a self dependent life to its predecessora birth has transpired in manand birth

arrogantbut sure of powernot timidand yet incredibly soft and shy and seriousShe is plainly foreignshe is Germanlooks Frenchand plays like a VienneseOrto be exactshe merges the Germanheavinesswith the Viennese gay sadnessand the result is a sensuousness that is both deep and clearwith the haunting wail that distinguishes all the music which comes from ViennaShe looks almost like a little girlbut

of it music that is as sacred as an organ meditation and as passionate as a Russian slave songHowevergeneralizations will not serve to give any musician s special qualityand this one is so emphatically individual as to make description easyTo begin withshe was concertising in Europe as a wonder child at the age of sixFor a number of years her playing brought forth a chorus of superlatives from the critics her full blooming toneher great taste in phrasingeconomic use of the bowglowing passion of interpretationher fiery temperamentremarkable earnestness and will powerthe soullifeand emotion in her presentations The verdict of aa veritable artist soulappeared to be unanimous and one man summed up with admirable insight and simplicity Her chief excellence is in thisthat she seeks her main task to be an artist in the real and earnest sense of the wordand whosoever comes to hear music does not go empty from her Friedrich Spielhagen wrote a sonnet to herof which I have a carefulbut metrically inadequatetranslation Thou standst before usa picture of wondrous charmThe little violin thou holdstin tenderessHalf maidenlyhalf like a child in dress Hast soared away from Heaven s angel farm Toward where thy large mild eye is dreamingAnd he ended it with these lines Thou movest thy bowNo sounds are these of nicely moved stringsNoNoThy own sweet soul rings out and sings The melodies that have with you come From yon high wide sphered homeT o where thy longing soul swings upward nowOur apologies to MrSpielhagen for that more than atrocious twelfth line and for the other deficienciesBut the last line is particularly keen in its photographyIt has the spirit of herAfter much touring in Europe she came to this country and played under the same promising conditionsThe critics predicted that if she should decide to stay here she would probably out rival our own few noted women violinistsAnd then came a period of sorrowbereavementhardshipand illnessand in the meantime the problem of livingThat problem becomes a real one when an artist loves life just a bit more than her art and refuses to make that spiritual compromise which life tries to wrest from one in the hard placesOne must liveand it takes money to do it rather than artThe romantic notion that all genius has to do is to stand up and make itself heard is one of the silliest notions the great public suffers fromOnly the hundreth person recognizes genius when it proclaims itself the rest are as blind as this department store audience until the sign posts have been put upwith letters large enough to be easily readAlsothe amount of machinery and money involved in the arrangement of concert engagements would surprise the public as much as the true stories of what it costs thewealthy patronto get his artist started toward recognitionAnd so this particular genius will continue for a while to cast her pearls in a lunch roomand a few of the discerning will find her out and thank their stars that they may hear such beauty at the small cost of a bad club sandwich and a worse cup of coffeeIf you go there you will be haunted by music for days afterwardI sayhauntedbecause that is the only word to describe your feeling of pursuit by melodyAnd I think I have discovered the reason for itA poet once said that the only permanent emotion we human being are capable of isnot loveas we like to imaginebut longingAnd that is what this music says to youIt is the very essence of longingthe enternal seekingthe rapturous satisfactionthe disappoint The Little Review mentand the renewed questI have never heard such a quality of Sehnsucht in any musicit is almost more than you can bearOf coursein these surroundingsyou must listen to the complete gamut of new popular songsbut at intervalswhen the managerial demand fornoisecan be ignored for a momentyou will be rewarded by the Thais Meditation or a Schutt waltz or that exquisite Saint Saens poem called The Swanor even a Tschaikowsky songWhere does the tone come fromyou keep wonderingNot from a wooden instrumentnot from small human fingerssurelyIt is tone of such richness and depth that you sometimes have the illusion of each note being sung twice It transcends music to me entirely and becomes a matter of lifeor of soul said a critic who listened with me the other dayThrough it all the artist s earnest face is still and unchangingThat is part of the fascinationthe contrast of that tumultuous singing and the thoughtfuldreaming face that seems to control it all My violin belongs to meyes she says but that is such a cold wordIt is part of my bodyI feel it is growing on me just like my arms and handsI could not live without it If you watch her closely you will decide that her playing is the result of an extraordinary sensitiveness to lifeIf you know heras I doyou will expand that judgment to this onean extrordinary strength about lifefor she is both deep and strongqualities that are supposed to be

Comedy Theatre wasn t large enough to hold the audiencealthough Scandinavian patriotism accounted for a good deal of itHe came on the stage with Brander Matthewsthe apotheosis of the academicand the contrast was strikingMatthews was talldullprofessionalBrandeswith his keen facealert eyesand shock of grayish hairwas possibly the most fully alive person in the roomHe radiated interesthuman connection with anything vitalWe were all a little sorry his subject was Shakespearewe wanted to hear of something modernAnd when the first part of the lecture was readcouched in scholarly but terse Englishwe felt cheatedIt was good criticismand informingbut it wasn t the sort of thing we had expected from BrandesSuddenly a spark shot out The quotation is from memoryW e cannot emphasize too strongly the fact that all works of literature which have a real effect on mankindall works which endure hundreds of yearsfind their inspiration not in booksbut in lifeThe words were pronounced with excited intensitySoon came another We used to define the genius as the man who interprets his agenow we know that the genius is the man whoworking against his agecreates new timesDrBrandes broke into a lively sally at the BaconiansHe spoke of Shakespeare s errors in scholarshipThese Bacon would surely have avoidedbut of Shakespeare s great lines Bacon could not possibly have written oneHe ended that section with something like thisThe Baconian theory was founded by the uneducatedit was developed by the half educatedand it is now held solely by idiotsThe audience was immensely pleased at his sharp fireDrBrandesepigrams sometimes sound as if he substituted wit for wisdomBut that is because the epigrams stick and are repeatedHis method is to open with an epigram to catch the attentionto proceed with a line of sound argumentand at the end to finish superblyThe Little Review 41 with a sentence that contains his conclusions and impales his opponent at the same timeWith Frank HarrisDrBrandes was no more gentleBy parallel quotation Harris was made to appear ridiculousBrandes showed that whatever in his writings is sound has been said beforeThis was the end of the lectureMrHarris says that it is possible to admire Shakespearebut that it is impossible to worship himLadies and gentlemenI do the impossibleAfterwards came a supper of the Scandinavian Societyat which the guest of honor made a speech that looked brilliant and was lively even as a piece of pantomimebut it was in DanishDrBrandes was beaming and unaffectedly cordial with everybodyHe smilingly interrupted one of the pompous addresses in his honor to correct a quotation from GoetheHe proposed a toast to the charming young lady who acted as his American managerand said that the success of his tour was due entirely to herLater a consul made a highly complimentarybut exceedingly tediousspeechDrBrandes fidgeted until he could stand it no longerthen he quickly got uptook his champagne glassran over to the orator and slapped him on the shouldersaying You are a very nice man The rest was drowned in the toastA NEW LITERATURE The other day an illustrator saw a hand mirror in a publisher s officeHe put the mirror against a book cover and held it at arm s length There he said is the ideal jacket for a novelEvery woman likes to imagine herself the heroine of the book she is reading But the publisher was wiser You are half right he answered But she wants to be a Gibson heroineTo see her own facewithout flatterywould startle her into disapproval of the book A recent symposium in The Sun bore the impressive titleThe Sentimentalization of Woman in American FictionAll the authors were agreed that realism doesn t go because of the desire of the reader to be flatteredIf she isn tthe novel isunpleasantdepressing You may paint your villainess blackbutas your reader will take her for an enemyyou must see that she is properly punishedBut if your heroine does anything unconventionalit must be of the kind that your reader enjoys by imaginationthough she wouldn t have the courageThe Little Review to do itOnly you must not make the thrills so strong as to shock the reader into self consciousness and self disapprovalGeorg Brandes said that our novels are written by old maids for old maidsIf we would only put into our literature the same genius and daring that we put into our skyscrapers The thing none of the authors seemed to see is that it is futile to stop at blaming the readersOf course the great public is comparatively stupidIt is everywhereit always has been and always will beWhat is a leader if he is not someone in advance of the othersAnd the essential act for a leader is to leadHe can t get a following until he does thatOnly a coward stays behind and flatters the crowd because he is afraid they will not come after himPerhaps they won t follow his particular routeBut if he goes on fearlessly he has done the best that is in himanywayThe chances are that if he has a sincere conviction and marches far enough in one direction they will at least struggle along after a whileThey may even follow in hordesWhat we need first is not a more intelligent publicbut courageous writersNaturally the matter is not simpleYour artist has to be fed and clothedIf he is creating a new mediumas did Wagnerhe even needs large resources to produce his artThe solution used to be the wealthy patronThe petty monarch maintained a musician or a painter to enhance the glory of his courtThe noble supported a writer from personal prideThe monastery afforded a refuge for the unworldly creatorIt would be difficult to find a great artist before the last century who did not have some such subsidyunless he had means of his ownSince then democracy has permeated the worldFast pressesadvertisingand royalties have been inventedNow the public is the writer s patronMusic is often subsidizedto be sureand painters can still sell their canvases to the wealthyBut the earnings of the writer are in strict proportion to the number of copies of his books that can be soldThere is a distinct advantage in this situationThe virtue of democracy is not the government of the majoritybut the opportunity of the minorityThe minority becomesnot a defensive close corporationbut a body of fighting visionariesThe emphasis is placed on growthThe eternal impulse of the minority to turn itself into a majority prevents a static ageThe strongest leadinstead of the highly born The Little Review 43 So it must be with our writersDifficulty insures heroesW e can discount at once the truckling commercial writersBut the others must be deeply sincere and strong in order to exist at allThere is little room for the dilletanteLet our young people who have something to say recognize the situationThey must dedicate themselves to a probable povertyThey must gird their loins and sharpen their weaponsThey must be prepared to wait yearsif need beeven for recognitionEvery energy must be devoted to saying as well as may be the thing that is in themAnd sohoping nothingfearing nothingliving simplysupporting themselves as best they maybut always doing the thing that is worth while for its own sakethey may produce a literature that has not been equalled since the world beganOthers of us can share in this glorious undertakingDiscerning critics must sift the true from the falseThey must lay aside the twin snobberies of praising or blaming a work because of its popularityThey must fight eternally for the sincereThey must point out directionsthey must prize meanings above methodsThey must give a nucleus to the intelligent reading public and constantly augment itThey must bear sturdy witness to the fact that art is not an amusement for idle momentsbut the consciousness of the raceThey must show its relation to life as well as to livingThey must be predisposed in favor of no work on account of its nationalityschool or tendencyJust as Brandes enlarged the conception of literature by showing it as a world phenomenonthey must rid it of petty divisions in the realm of thoughtNo more should such a statement asGalsworthy is a poet rather than a novelistbe allowed to pass as criticismA novelist may be a poet or a philosopher or a psychologist or a historian or a sociologistAny of these may combine the intrinsic abilities of any or all of the othersHe is greater for doing soThe only test of his work is its effectivenessA work of art is an organismthe highest product of natureinfinitely more realmore beautifulmore potentthan any flowerOnly when we see it as suchand not as a collection of petals and stamensor as a member of a speciesshall we know itThe whole problem of creating a literatureas of doing anything elseis one of direction and powerIf we blame someone else for our deficienciesif we stand aloofif we bow to circumstances and are afraid to pay for what we wantwe shall of course do nothingAnd we shall not enjoy ourselves or the world much

CompanyNew York It s not a matter of intellect or logicit s lovinglifewith one s insidewith one s stomachIvan KaramazovChiefly concerned with the fester of civilizationliteraturemusicpaintingall the modern forms of individual expression are elliptical in the sense that the old aesthetic values of emotional beauty seem to have become nullifiedor else congealedin the artist s direct application of his instrument to the repudiation of fixed social values or moralitiesto the expansion of life interestsW e today want more than beauty of external form we want the beauty of depth The true artist is such primarily because of his engrossing appetite for lifebecauseas Flaubert saidof the chaos in his soulAnd although Flaubert kept on chiseling words around the lives of men and women totally devoid of inspirating individualityhis dictum has been nobly exemplified in the life and writings of Fyodor Dostoevskythat great hearted epileptic Russian of whose psychological powers Nietzsche admittedly availed himselfTolstoy was reported to have saidin conversation with a writer for Le TempsA woman who has never suffered pain is a beast He could have stretched the allegation to include the other sexif only by way of illusion to that intense spiritual quality in modern Russian literaturea literature that has never beennotablyan off shoot ofas much as a protest againstthe retrogressive structures of its respective periodsThis spiritualor psychicalconcern with the individual s adjustment to the functioning of life has been revealed to highest degree inThe Little Review 45 Dostoevsky s novelsIt is also manifest in the analytical mould assumed by the creative arts of our timeWhile Dostoevsky s personality is separably bound up with his workprofitable appreciation of the latter can be considerably amplified with knowledge of the important facts of his life and the conditions with which he struggledI will record the more essential facts of his life as I have gathered themand try to explain the causes that have made for the distinction in his work from that of all other writersHe was born in a charity hospital in Moscowin 1821His father was an army surgeonhis mother a store keeper s daughterI like to think that he derived his expressive powersor rather the nebulae out of which they subsequently developedfrom his motherperhaps partly because of my theory that men of acute genius ultimately do transcend the difference of sex in the quality of their personalities as well as in that of their workLike most imaginative youths who come into contact with fine artDostoevsky was stimulated to literary expression by his study of classical and contemporaneous European literatureHe had lived twenty three years when he graduated from a StPetersburg school of military engineeringHis first novelPoor Folkwas published three years laterand served to focus upon him the attention of the criticsIn 1 849 Dostoevsky was arrestedwith members of a radical organizationon governmental charges of seditionThe terrible suffering he sustained while awaiting his executionhe was first confined in prison for eight monthshave been set forth in striking passages of his novelsThe Idiot and Letters from a Dead HouseThe sentence of death was finallyand very unexpectedlycommuted to one of imprisonment in Siberia for four yearsAt the expiration of this period he served perforce as a private soldier in the Russian army for three more yearsWhen he was permitted to return to StPetersburg he was accompanied by his first wifewhom he had loved and married while in exileDostoevsky s interminable suffering from epileptic seizuresit has been suggested that these fits originated in a beating administered to him by his father when Fyodor was a boyhis povertyand the constant accumulation of debt the terrific haste with which he found it necessary to write his most profound booksall have made it natural to himin dwelling upon any physiological aspect of his charactersto be as unconvincing as the eremite attempting an analysis of conditions of sex lifeIn shortDostoevsky s nervous disorders pervaded his sensual senseof beautyof beauty in all its manifestationsAt the same time it must be remarked that this negation of physical responsiveness surely intensified the acuteness of his mental visionwhich was otherwise refined emotionally by the results of his imprisonment and lifelong hardshipsAnd this also explains why Dostoevsky s novels are lacking so singularly in the tingle of the physical contact of his characterswhy the suffering of his men and women move us so profoundlywhy his writings are so unevenhis dialogues of such elemental powerand his purely descriptive passages so ordinaryThe elemental power in his dialogues is due chiefly to the vigor of action accredited his charactersIn his work is not to be found the picturesque phrasethe adroitly turned periodthe illuminating metaphorthe sequence of constructionthe tone or shading offered by the commingling of his objectsDostoevsky has no style of formhis outlines are amorphousIt is in his power of transcribing the living voiceof recording in never failing reflex emotionalism the lives and deeds of his startling figures that he is supremeIf you have read one of his books you know much of what he has to sayHis other works are repetitionsmainlyFor Dostoevsky does not attempt to paint characterand rarely does he stop to show the subtly reacting influence of environment upon his men and womenAlways he is concerned with the idea of the individual s personal adjustments to lifeEach book of his throbs with the discordant elements that clash over the establishment of this ideaand always its conclusions are recognizedThat is why I regard Dostoevsky as an optimistAnd his emphasis on humanity s spiritual conception of lifeno matter what the costgrew more and more pronounced in his later worksHis faith in human beings is expressed in one set themewhich can be conveniently resolved into terms of comparison on one hand the individual s evasion of life s realities by the exercise of materialand therefore fictitiousvaluesand on the other handthe frank acceptance of life s realities for the attainment of a proportionate spiritual balanceIn Crime and PunishmentDrRaskolnikov is in doubt as to theThe Little Review 47 ultimate worth of this attainmentuntil he expiates his crime in killing the old moneylenderI forget her namenot by confessingDostoevsky is too fine a realist for thatbut by obtaining personal solace from the regenerating qualities of his resignationAnd it is characteristic of our writer s method that Raskolnikov is assisted toward this state of resignation by his loveSoniathe prostitutewhose regard for the murderer is based upon the confirmation evidenced in him of the faith that has been stimulated in herselfSimilar in thesisthough expressed in terms of minor differencesis Dostoevsky s last and unquestionably finest workThe Brothers KaramazovIt is incompleteactually one third as long as he had intended it to beHe died before he could finish the bookNevertheless it is compactly formed material as the work now standsand superior to his other novels not because his outlines are more constrainedhis movement more co ordinateand the actual writing of a more intensive qualitybut because here he defines his own conception of spiritual beauty in a distinctive fashion not to be found in his other booksHe offers us the history of a familyand what a familyEach figure in this domesticgroup embodies conflicting phases of his great ideaFyodor Karamazovthe fatheris a sensualist of the lowest type imaginableHis three sons are DmitriIvanand AloyshaThere is also anotherillegitimatesonSmerdyakovan epilepticDmitri Karamazov inherits his father s passion for winewomenand songbut the son s pursuit of this tame and conventional item is tempered by frequent lapsesby periods of misgivingThe second son is a materialist and a cynicHe changes his mind after a severe illnessand his materialistic beliefs are all but supplanted by intense spiritual curiosityThe third and youngest son is an idealistlovable and lovingHere again we have Dostoevsky s discordant elements conveyed in terms of human characterizationsThe plot of the story is as formless as life itselffor it is with lifenot with plotsthat Dostoevsky dealsDmitri s hatred of his father is intensified by the rivalry that exists between the two in their common pursuit of Grushenka s affectionsGrushenka is a woman of the demi mondeThe authorI thinktried to draw her in lines that would reveal a physical zest of lifeas evidencedfor examplein Tolstoy s Anna KareninaHis failure to make Grushenka a convincing individualas an individualis typicalfor the reasons I have already advanced The Little Review Development of the story shows how Dmitri s repeatedly avowed determination to kill his father bears fruitThe elder Karamazov is found dead one nightwith his skull crushedDmitri is imprisonedAnd the rest of the bookwhich is devoted to Dmitri s trialthe moral regeneration of Ivanand the urge of life in Aloyshaapproaches psychological heightsor depthsthat have not been surpassed to this daySmall wonder that Nietzsche referred so affectionately to thegiant spirit I have made reference to Dostoevsky soptimism A better word for it is faithfaith of a new high orderHe is the most cheerfulsunlight giving writer in Russian literature The essence of religious feeling says Prince Myshkin in The Idiot does not come under any sort of reasoning or atheismand has nothing to do with any crimes or misdemeanors Prince Myshkin is the central figure of the novelhe is theidiot and everybody abuses himHe is insulted and beatenand robbed and deceived and lovedHe is the most singular figure in literaturehe is Dostoevsky himselfBut he is not an idiot in any senseHe is so profoundly simple and wiseand has such great faith in human beingsthat he is mistaken by the men and women of ordinary passions as a foolWhile he can be readily toyed with by womena significant phase of the writer s own attitude toward the sexPrince Myshkin is regarded by them from a common basis of understandingFor them he holds no quality of sex Perhaps you don t know thatowing to my illness he sayshe too is an epilepticI know nothing of women It is in The Idiot that Dostoevsky s women are at least life likeThe Epanchin sistersespecially the youngestAglaiaare nottypesin the usual sensebut preconceived studiesThe pages devoted to Aglaia s love affair with Prince Myshkin are of the happiest in the bookBesides the books I have already mentionedthe more important works are The Possessedin which national politics play a large partPoor Folkthe story of a poor clerk s love for a poor woman who eventually turns from him and Letters from a Dead HouseThis last is a book of personal experiencesand reveals Dostoevsky s relations with the criminals with whom he was imprisoned in SiberiaThe mental temper of men who disregard and break the common and socialThe Little Review 49 lawsis set forth with the passionate curiosity that lies behind all his probings of the human soulI am strongly tempted to offer quotationsto showin this passage or thathow deeply Dostoevsky looked into the most extreme boundaries of human sensibilitiesbut on the whole extracts from his writings would do more harm than goodHis work is so disconnectedthough not in any sense detachedthat extracts could not serve here to indicate the amazing clarity of his visionHis books arouse a feeling of wonder that there can be so many things in our own individual emotions with which we never before came into contactHe moves us so profoundly because he tears his men and women out of their morally bound lives and makes them confront stupendous questionsthe questions of lifeHe plies detail upon detail of human misery until one feels that the whole world is reeling from himthen grows aware of the sweet white glow of Dostoevsky s faithand feels that life can hold no terrorsthat he is above the petty miseries of human strifeThat is why I say Dostoevsky s optimism is of the new high orderDostoevsky purges one s mindHe makes you conscious of the beauty of a soulBOOK DISCUSSIONAN UNREELING REALIST The Titanby Theodore DreiserJohn Lane CompanyNew YorkTHEODOR E DREISER possesses none of the standard qualifications for the art of fiction writingHe is not imaginative but inventivehe is not clever but clearhe is not excited but calmWhatever the flaws in his considerable body of work no fair minded reader may say that it is made to catch popular applauseIts tremendous distinction is sincerityAnother characteristic which his novels ex The Little Review hibit is resolute purposeDreiser is aiming at somethingand in The Titanthe second book in an unfinished trilogyhe takes a long if wobbly step toward itPreviously to the publishing of this volume he had not even hinted at what he intended to work outOne thing was certainhe was not a triflerhe was not trying to write best sellersliterary success was not in his mindHe had set out seriously and indefatigably to writenot so much what he felt and thoughtas what he sawSome day he would try to get at the realities that lay back of their representationsHe would probably undertake to reveal the soul of the American nationHe would pass through the growth stages of a nationand achieve some kind of spiritual national lifeIn the last two pages of The Titan this guess at his purpose receives appreciable encouragementMoreoverit is made evident for the first timein these concluding paragraphsthat Dreiser s prosaic realism springs not only from a vaguedeep idealism but a largehidden spiritualityFor at the core of him Dreiser is a profoundly religious personNeither his style nor his stuff is far above the dead level of mediocrityin factDreiser s rhetoric is often inexcusably atrocious intentionally crudeone is tempted to assertObviously he is not interested in stylehe is conscious of something bigger than that revealing itself in a hugeuglyunfinished moving picturea net result symbolical of a youngrawriotousunsynthesized national lifeOne is therefore tempted to say that Dreisermore than any other authoris the personification of AmericaHe represents the composite personality of Uncle SamAfter reading The Financier and running far into the interminable pages of The Titan I felt that in the absence of cameraskodaksBaedekersand historians Dreiser would be worth whileHis endless reels of pictorial facts did not impress me as possessing sufficient animation successfully to compete with these odd rivalsbut I admired his consistent sincerity and simplicity and felt that something important was promised by the mere unfinishedness of his picturesI was sure that he did not write as one inspiredand certainly not as one firedAnd after finishing The Titan I felt that here was a work having the aspects of a seriously performed dutyexacted by fidelity to some personal theory of industrial changeI could not imagine the author happy as an artist is happy in his creative workhe was The Little Review 51 too conscious of service to a causeBut in the last paragraph I discovered a bigpersonal note which introduced an attitude that extends beyond the borders of materialismIt presented another Dreiseran author who was much more than a cinematographsnapping superficial impressions of a vast panoramaTwo years ago I should not have attributed the following words to Theodore DreiserIn a mulch of darkness is bedded the roots of endless sorrowsand of endless joysCanst thou fix thine eye on the morningBe gladAnd if in the ultimate it blind theebe glad alsoThou hast livedAfter laboring through arid deserts of descriptionthis memorable passagefraught with recognitionsatisfactionchallengehopeand promisestands out as an oasisThe Titanby virtue of its boldgraphic strokesloses its identity as a treewith sharply defined individual charactersand represents the forestIt is more like a jungleand the jungle is our national lifeinto which the morning sun inevitably will shine DeWitt CWingTHE REVOLT OF THEONCE BORNChallengeby Louis Untermeyer The Century CompanyNew YorkTHERE has recently appeared a volume of verse by Louis Untermeyer which is an excellent example of the determinedly young and eupeptic philosophy so prevalent todaythe philosophy of revoltThe book is named Challenge and as challenge it must be consideredTo be sure it is rhymedbut the fact seems quite incidentalTo rhyme a polemic does not make it poetryand one feels sure that MrUntermeyer is more proud of the spiritual attitude than of the artistryThe book is a revoltbut a careful perusal of its pages fails to reveal against what it revoltsAt first glance one might think it socialisticbut it is not clearly enough visualized for thatSocialism has at least found the enemyMrUntermeyer manfully girds on his armor and sets forth to warshouting his challenge lustily the whileAnd whyafter allbe particular about having an actual enemyLifewith a capital Lcan do duty for thatorthe scornfulThe Little Review and untroubled skies or thecold complacency of earth The revolt is the pointand MrUntermeyer drives it home with all the phrases of frozen impetuosity to be discovered in a very useful vocabulary Athletic courageeager nightLife s lusty bannerimpetuous windsraging mirth etc are scattered carefully through the pagesBut unfortunatelyvirilitywith all due respect to the reviewer who mentioned these poems in the June number of The Little Reviewhas a way of oozing out of such phrasesleaving them empty of everything save a painful determination to be manly at all costsBut though MrUntermeyer is not quite clear on some subjects he is very clear on othersSeveral things seem to have struck him with peculiar forcethat city streets are dirtyfor instancethat strife is tonic for young bloodand that it is difficult for the human soul to conceive of complete annihilationThese things he proclaims passionately and challenges the world to disprove themA little couplet from Kipling s Jungle Book suggests itself rather maliciously as the probable attitude of the world towards this outbreak There is none like to me says the Cub in the pride of his earliest killBut the Jungle is large and the Cub he is smallLet him think and be stillSeriouslyhoweverMrUntermeyer s attitude is what William James calls the attitude of theonce born One feels that he thinks in one dimensionthat he does not see around his subjectnor hear the overtones which surround every happening for a man of deep intellectThe revolt is Walt Whitman s magnificent revoltwhich is overpowering in a giantcropping out in a man of very ordinary staturewhere it sits a little ridiculouslyAs philosophy much of thisprinted on a neat little cardwould do splendidly to hang in a business office for the encouragement of the employeesAs poetry it is negligibleMrUntermeyer lacks entirely the one gift which could redeem itthe gift of poignancyThis lack is particularly striking in the middle sectioncalled Interludesin which he pauses for a little from revoltThese are love songs and lyricsa field in which anything not perfect is no longer acceptableAnd MrUntermeyer s are not perfectHis sense of rhythm is extremely primitive and his lyrics are full of wordsOnly now and thenwhen he forgets for a moment how manly he isdoes he sayThe Little Review 53 anything simply enough to strike homeThese linesfor instancefrom Irony stick There is no kind of death to kill the sands that lie so meek and still But man is great and strong and wiseAn d so he diesBut in the main it is unfortunate that MrUntermeyerwho writes so much and so readably on the subject of poetryshould put out so pretentious and undeveloped a volume as this isIt is inevitable that it should affect his standing as a criticand there seems little doubt that his work in that field is really valuable to the cause of poetry in America today Eunice TietjensTWO BIOGRAPHIESVERLAINE AND TOLSTOYPaul

a ditMon filsil faut m aimer Some months ago in reviewing Edmond Lepelletier s voluminous book Paul VerlaineHis Life and WorkI remarked that the Poet of Absinthe and Violets was still awaiting his BoswellMy view has not changed after reading Wilfrid Thorley s monograph on Verlainebut my wish for an adequate biography of the signer of Romances sans Paroles has now become counterbalanced by an earnest prayer that the memory of the poet may be saved from such indelicate manipulators as MrThorleyWhy this respectable Englishman should have attempted to treat the life of the most wayward French poet since Villon can be explained by no other reason than that it was a case ofmade to order When a Velasquez is pierced by a fanatical suffragette the whole civilized world is roused to indignationbut when an honest philistine unceremoniously puffs his cheap smoke into the face of a dead poet there is not a single protest against that sort of vandalismFear of the editor s blue pencil restrains me from putting my attitude more outspokenly The Little Review 55 A conscientious compilator would have found sufficient material for an unpretentious sketch of the life of Verlaine and for an appreciation of his worksLepelletier gives an amazing mass of facts and personal reminiscencesyou may ignore his naive interpretationsArthur Symons in The Symbolist Movement in Literature has a masterpiece essay on Verlainenot to mention a number of other French and English writers who have given us glimpses of the imperceptible image of the poetwriters who knew what they were taking aboutMrThorley has made use of various sourcesbut in a peculiar wayHe fished out the anecdotal scrapsthe piquant detailsthe filthy hintsand patched up a caricature portrait of a lewdperverseundesirable whose poetryI quote reluctantly was born solely of the genitals whoselife is but the trite old story of the emotions developed at the expense of domestic peace and civic orderof art for art s sake made to condone the manner of its begettingand the trend of its appealof the hushed acquiescence in emotion as a sacred thingwhatever the quality of the impulse from which it ripens or the level of ideas on which it feeds Out of the ninety odd pages of stuff seventy nine are devoted tobiographysufficiently spicy to make any toothless old rake chucklethe rest is given over tocriticisma mutilated melange of some of the views of SymonsGeorge Mooreand othersflavored with the compilator s own commonplacesI quote from the closing linesA specious and high sounding phrase has been invented to excuse the perversities of imaginative genius by speaking of its achievement as aconquest of new realms for the spirit But the worth of such acquisitions depends on the nature of the territoryand if it bemorallya malarial swamp conducive only to a human type found subversive in our normal worldit will always appear to the English mind that we shall do well to forego the new kingdom and to withhold our homage from its discovererThatnice is nastynasty nice and the creative artist the sole arbitermust be hotly opposed so long as a social conscience survivesAnd this was written in Anno Domini 1914A sense of fairness urges me to rehabilitate theEnglish mindby recalling a passage from MrThorley s compatriotArthur SymonsThe artistit cannot be too clearly understoodhas no more part in society than a monk in domestic lifehe cannot be judged by its ruleshe can be neither praised nor blamed for his acceptance or rejection of its conventionsSocial rules are made by normal people for normal peopleand the man of genius is fundamentally abnormal It is high time that this axiom became a truism and that we cease to measure the artist with the yard stick of conventional morality L artmes enfantsc est d être absolument sai même sang Verlaineand somewhere else he reveals a bit of that self with his usual sincerityI believeand I sin in thought as in actionI

consign itin shortinto literary formforgetting all religious ideasor not letting one of them escape usCan any one in good faith condemn us as poetsA hundred times no AndindeedI should echoa hundred times no exclaims the EnglishmanArthur SymonsI cannot resist the temptation of quoting the happiest definition of Verlaine s personality written by Charles Morice back in 1888 The soul of an immortal childthat is the soul of Verlainewith all the privileges and all the perils of so beingwith the sudden despair so easily distractedthe vivid gaieties without a causethe excessive suspicions and the

division of forces between the longing after what is evil and the adoration of what is goodor ratherin the antagonism of spirit and flesh I have not mentioned the most strikingfeatureof MrThorley s

corresponding to the development of mankindthe religion of Jesusbut purified from dogma and mysticisma practical religionnot promising bliss in futurebut giving happiness on earth To work consciously for the union on earth by religion From a letter to the poet Fet in 1898I am so different to things of this life that life becomes uninterestingI hope you will love me though I be blackFrom the fragment There are no guilty peopleThere was a time when I tried to change my position which was not in harmony with my consciencebut the conditions created by the pastby my family and its claims upon mewere so complicated that I did not know how to free myself1 had not the strengthNow that I am over eighty and have become feeble I have given up trying to free myselfStrange to sayas my feebleness increases I realize more and more strongly the wrongfulness of my positionand it grows more and more intolerable to meOn his death bed at the railroad station AstapovoNovember1910I am tired of this world of menTolstoy s failure was inevitablefor he had approached life with the uncompromising logic of a child or a godFor fifty years he preached his religionand during all that time he remained splendidly inconsistentHe opposed private property and proceeded to live on his estatehe had denounced marriage and was a father to thirteen childrenNotwithstanding his deadly hatred for the Russian governmenthe bitterly denounced the liberals and the revolutionists for theirun Christianways of fighting the enemybut his greatest contradictionto the joy of the intellectual worldconsisted in the victory of the artist over the moralist as manifested in his numerous novels and playsThe work of Edward Garnett is conscientious and isto my knowledgethe best short biography of TolstoyIt was a happy idea to discard the traditional portrait and use a reproduction of Kramskoy s paintingwhich dates back to the sixtiesif I am not mistakenIt is when looking at this portraita great piece of art in itselfthat we envisage the author of War and PeaceA few words from the description of Tolstoy s face by PATerzeyeonvoHis face was a true peasant s facesimplerusticwith a broad nosea weather beaten skinand thick overhanging browsfrom beneath which smallkeengrey eyes peered sharply forthOne instantly divines in Tol The Little Review stoy a man of the highest societywith polishedunconstrained mannersOn the one hand an insatiable thirst for power over peopleand on the other an unconquerable ardor for inward purity and the sweetness of meeknessIn this chain of seethingimperious instincts linked with delicate spiritual organization lies the profound tragicness of Tolstoy s personalityMrGarnett succeeds in giving the quintessence of Tolstoy s works and teachings in less than a hundred pagesLike most of the Russian s eulogistic biographersMrGarnett has not escaped the fallacy of exaggerating the moral power that Tolstoy exercised over the governmentTo say that the Czar and his ministersdared not touchthe outspoken anarchist and hereticout of dread of Europenayof Russia is to reveal one s ignorance of the brazen defiance displayed by Muscovite autocrats in regard to public opinionAs the Germans put it Herr Kossackschamen Sie sich Tolstoyas a matter of facthad helped to check the revolutionary spirit of his compatriots in a greater degree than the tyrannic persecutions of Von PlehveHad he not appealed time and again to embrace his doctrine of Non ResistanceHad he not denounced the revolutionists as violent prototypes of their hangersCould the government see any

DoubledayPageampCompanyNew York Did you ever take supper in the apartments of a dear bachelor friendon a night when the wind howled outside the windowand the rain beat against the paneAnd after the satisfying mealwhose The Little Review 59 perfect appointment made you forget all save the luxury of livingdid you retire to the spacious living roomand after accepting an aromatic Havanastretch your feet out to the crackling log fireand as the smoke from your cigar crawled upward listen to the philosophical analyses of your cultured host on that marvelously simple and 0 profoundly complex servant and master of manthe human mindOf such an evening is the atmosphere of ChanceNot academically deepbut deep from the standpoint of a full life and an active intelligenceEveryone loves to analyze his fellow creaturesSome do it wellsome do it badlybut we all do itConrad does it masterfullyThere doesn t seem to be a type which holds a mystery for himThe village pillarthe frailill fated maidthe

expeditions long and shortHis characters liveThey mingle good and badandas strong characters shouldweave for themselves a charming story of loveadventuretrialand victorynever triteand always surprisingIt is a tale built of character studies and garnished with odd conjective philosophyi Our new acquaintance pausedthen added meditatively Queer manAs if it made any differenceQueer manIt s certainly unwise to admit any sort of responsibility for our actionswhose consequences we are never able to foresee remarked Marlow by way of assent The consequence of his action was that I got a ship said the other That could not do much harm he added with a laugh which argued a probably unconscious contempt of general ideasBut Marlow was not put offHe was patient and reflectiveHe had been at sea many years and I verily believe he liked sea life because upon the whole it is favourable to reflectionI am speaking of the now nearly vanished sea life under sailTo those who may be surprised at the statement I will point out that this life secured for the mind of him who embraced it the inestimable advantages of solitude and silenceMarlow had the habit of pursuing general ideas in a peculiar mannerbetween jest and earnest OhI wouldn t suggest he said that your namesakeMrPowellthe Shipping Masterhad done you much harmSuch was hardly his intentionAnd even if it had been he would not have had the powerHe was but a manand the incapacity to achieve anything distinctly good or evil is inherent in our earthly conditionMediocrity is our markAnd perhaps it s just as wellsincefor the most partwe cannot be certain of the effect of our actionsI don t know about the effect the other stood up to Marlow man 60 The Little Review fully What effect did you expect anyhowI tell you he did something uncommonly kindHe did what he could Marlow retorted gently and on his own showing that was not a very great dealI cannot help thinking that there was some malice in the way he seized the opportunity to serve youHe managed to make you uncomfortableYou wanted to go to seabut he jumped on the chance of accommodating your desire with a vengeanceI am inclined to think your cheek alarmed himAnd this was an excellent occasion to suppress you altogetherFor if you accepted he was relieved of you with every appearance of humanityand if you made objectionsafter requesting his assistancemind youit was open to him to drop you as a sort of impostorYou might have had to decline that berth for some very valid reasonFrom sheer necessityperhapsThe notice was too uncommonly shortBut under the circumstances you d have covered yourself with ignominy Our new friend knocked the ashes out of his pipeThere is something about Conrad which gives a warm feeling about the heartA certain fineness of humora certain fullness of sympathyHe never mixes his similesthey always take the same tone and the same colorFor instanceI took a piece of cake and went out to bribe the Fyne dog into some sort of self controlHis sharpcomical yapping was unbearablelike stabs through one s brainand Fyne s deeply modulated remonstrances abashed the vivacious animal no more than the deeppatient murmur of the sea abashes a nigger minstrel on a popular beachFyne was beginning to swear at him in lowsepulchral tones when I appearedThe dog became at once wildly demonstrativehalf strangling himself in his collarhis eyes and tongue hanging out in the excess of his uncomprehensible affection for meThis was before he caught sight of the cake in my handA series of vertical springs high up in the air followedand thenwhen he got the cakehe instantly lost his interest in everything elseNothis illustration is not of Conrad s finestbut in a homely vay it illustrates a deep sympathy with lifewhich this strong worker and writer gives in such bountiful measure in all his literatureandto quote an eminent writer Literature and Conrad are interchangeable termsHenry Blackman SellAN AMERICAN NOVEL Clark Fieldby Robert Herrick Houghton Mifflin CompanyBoston It was but the other day that MrHerrick told us what he thought about the American novelThose who read the trenchant article found not only a criticism of our machine like fictionists and their half baked methodsbut also a sturdy conviction that the day was surely approaching when we should demand and receive a truer andThe Little Review 61 more vital presentation of our national life in our literatureAnd if MrHerricklong since tagged an apostate to our national creed of turgid optimismbelieves thiswe can safely trust to his cool vision and be glad that the tide has turnedThe rich human material lies ready at handand the audience is fast growing intelligent and discriminatingAs yethowever we await the writer or writers keen enough to perceive the opportunitypowerful enough to interest the public in what it has been unwilling to heedand of course endowed with sufficient insight to comprehend our big new world Whatever may be said for our other novelistssurely not one of them can exhibit a mingling of the powers of insight and artistry equal to that of Robert HerrickHis work from the beginning has been an honest and incisive attempt to interpret our life in its peculiar and universal aspectsin spite of the clamor of the public at his tearing away of the veils of sentimentality and pruderyThe errors into which he fell were due to the ardor of his spiritual visionwhich drove him into an impassioned taking of sidesHe has emerged from that stage into what his critics call hisold manner a more objective treatment of his materialBut in the process of change something was lostthe element of flaming intensity which gave the reader a similar capacity to feelIn this latest performanceas well as in One Woman s Lifehe is always coolclear sightedand admirably efficient in the task he sets himselfbut never passionateOn the contrarydespite the pervading atmosphere of earnestnesshe often assumes a playful satiric tonemordant but not bittera method well suited to his matter and purposeClara s Field tells the story of the influence of property upon the human beings who own it and hope to reap gold from its increasing valueAll that is left of the great Clark farm is a fifty acre field in a growing New England townbequeathed jointly to the two brothersEdward and Samuelthe former of whom has emigrated to the West and wholly disappeared from the ken of his relativesSo at first the tale is of the baleful influence of expectation delayed again and again in the case of Samuel who cannot sell the land because of his brother s half interestand who in consequence sinks into a sodden inertiain his son s disintegration into a lazy and drunkenVet in his sister Addie s sordid and pathetic sally into life resulting in the birth of another human being destined to taste of the fruit of their tree and to find itone dayvery bitter 62 The Little Review The greater portion of the novelthendeals with the influence of the realized wealth upon the unformedcolorless little girlAdellethe last of the ClarksIt is a masterly piece of workthe gradual development of the pale rooming house drudge into the silly and insolent woman of fashionand slowly but certainly into a human being with a soulLess promising stuff for a heroine neither fate nor MrHerrick could have chosenthe latter delights in ample admissions throughout the book of Adelle s lack of beautybrainsand charmYet he is always sufficiently temperate to escape the danger of caricatureAdelle is a convincing figureThe slow dawning upon her consciousness of the power of moneyhermagic lampwhich she need only rub to gratify any desireis followed by swift and constant use of the new weaponIt brings her a fresh assurancea few scatter brained friendssome stylish clothesandat lengtha callow youth for a husbandIt never brings her contact with a real person or friendship with a stimulating individualnor can it save her from the failure of her marriagenor compensate her for the death of her little boyAdelle s storythenturns out to be what we least expected it a hopeful oneIt leaves us with almost a sense of securityfor is she not one of those who canderive good from her mistakes and thereforethe safest sort of human being to raise in this garden plot of souls And although we are still saddled withthat absurd code of inheritance and property rights that the Anglo Saxon peoples have preserved from their ancient tribal days in the gloomy forests of the lower Rhine the situation is not without hopesince it has yielded a man of the judge s typein whom the beauty of a past idealism is coupled with the freshness of a new vision of responsibilityTo hark back to the recent article in The Yale Reviewwe believe that MrHerrick himself has given us an American novelthoroughly American in situationcharactertreatmentand even in philosophyWeas a peopleare beginning to suspect our boastful optimism as we become aware of the sordidness beneath the fair exterior of our glorious civilizationAnd in accordance with the western temperamentthe awareness of wrong leads not to bitter cynicism but to sturdy efforts toward ameliorationSuchthenis the spirit of Clara s Field a hopefulness in the power of courageand laborand a growing sense of social responsibility to move mounds that seem to have become immovable

31dary its limit which blocks the vision into the wide worldthe blue skyand the distant seaLoyalty to menWould that it might be soBut such loyalty costs so much trouble and toilFor the faithfulness that is genuine and livingthere is no lawno binding I mustonly a glorious I willOne day we shall have done with the loyalty which means master and servantleader and ledthe loyalty of the dog that is loyalest to him who feeds him best or beats him hardestOne day we shall understand what the loyalty of man meansthis new loyalty toward manin which souls meet and chime and work togetherand live in each otheryet each remains itself and true to itselfSothenthe law of change and of growth is the law of the new loyaltyas the law of fixedness and finishedness and finality was of the oldIt is the duty of such new loyalty to protect itself against the deadening force of habit and of petrifactionto guard itself against any obedience by which it would become disloyal to itselfSuch loyalty is too honorable to humor inertia and laziness under its bannertoo courageous to conceal cowardice behind a slave s patienceBut thought on our theme is usually lifted up to where the sky keeps company with the granite and the grassto a religious elevationNor do we need stop short hereUltimately the new loyalty is loyalty to Godthe new Godof whom something must be said laterThe God in whom all fulness dwells summons us to ever new truthsand reveals underground wells of living water throwing its spray aloft on life s ferns and flowersTo be loyal to him is never to sunder ourselves from his fulness and freshnessbut to co work with him who is forever making all things newAnd now I think we are at the endThe resultIt is needless to state itbut I would not shrink from the thankless taskIn a wordthenthe new loyaltyin harmony with the whole great changed view of the world and of lifeis loyalty to change and becoming rather than to finishedness and finalityto the future rather than to the pastto ideals rather than to conventionsto freedom rather than to authorityto personality rather than to institutionto character rather than to respectabilityto our hunger rather than to our satietyto the God that is to be rather than to the God that isThus the loyalty abidesbut the objects of loyalty change and pass The Little Review 67 A CHANGE OF PRICE With the August issuethe sixth month of our
