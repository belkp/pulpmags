clangor of brass beats against the hot sunlight  They bray and blare at the burning sky Red Red Coarse notes of red Trumpeted at the blue sky In long streaks of sound molten metal The vine declares itself Clang from its red and yellow trumpets Clang from its long nasal trumpets Splitting the sunlight into ribbons tattered and shot with  noise   I sit in the cool arbor in a green and gold twilight It is very still for I cannot hear the trumpets I only know that they are red and open And that the sun above the arbor shakes with heat My quill is newly mended And makes fine drawn lines with its point Down the long white paper it makes little lines Just lines up down criss cross My heart is strained out at the pin point of my quill It is thin and writhing like the marks of the pen My hand marches to a squeaky tune It marches down the paper to a squealing of fifes My pen and the trumpet flowers And Washington s armies away over the smoke tree to the  southwest Yankee Doodle my darling It is you against the British Marching in your ragged shoes to batter down King George What have you got in your hat Not a feather I wager Just a hay straw for it is the harvest you are fighting for Hay in your hat and the whites of their eyes for a target Like Bunker Hill two years ago when I watched all day  from the housetop Through Father s spy glass The red city and the blue bright water And puffs of smoke which you made Twenty miles away Round by Cambridge or over the Neck But the smoke was white white   To day the trumpet flowers are red red And I cannot see you fighting But old Mr Dimond has fled to Canada And Myra sings Yankee Doodle at her milking  The red throats of the trumpets bray and clang in the sunshine And the smoke tree puffs dun blossoms into the blue air  II THE CITY OF FALLING LEAVES  Leaves fall Brown leaves Yellow leaves streaked with brown They fall Flutter Fall again The brown leaves And the streaked yellow leaves Loosen on their branches And drift slowly downwards One One two three One two five All Venice is a falling of autumn leaves Brown And yellow streaked with brown   That sonnet Abate Beautiful I am quite exhausted by it Your phrases turn about my heart And stifle me to swooning Open the window I beg Lord What a strumming of fiddles and mandolins Tis really a shame to stop indoors Call my maid or I will make you lace me yourself Fie how hot it is not a breath of air See how straight the leaves are falling Marianna I will have the yellow satin caught up with silver  fringe It peeps out delightfully from under a mantle Am I well painted to day caro Abate mio You will be proud of me at the Ridotto hey Proud of being cavaliere servente to such a lady Can you doubt it bellissima Contessa A pinch more rouge on the right cheek And Venus herself shines less You bore me Abate I vow I must change you A letter Achmet Run and look out of the window Abate I will read my letter in peace  The little black slave with the yellow satin turban Gazes at his mistress with strained eyes   His yellow turban and black skin Are gorgeous barbaric The yellow satin dress with its silver flashings Lies on a chair Beside a black mantle and a black mask Yellow and black Gorgeous barbaric The lady reads her letter And the leaves drift slowly Past the long windows How silly you look my dear Abate With that great brown leaf in your wig Pluck it off I beg you Or I shall die of laughing  A yellow wall Aflare in the sunlight Chequered with shadows Shadows of vine leaves Shadows of masks Masks coming printing themselves for an instant Then passing on More masks always replacing them Masks with tricorns and rapiers sticking out behind Pursuing masks with veils and high heels The sunlight shining under their insteps One One two   One two three There is a thronging of shadows on the hot wall Filigreed at the top with moving leaves Yellow sunlight and black shadows Yellow and black Gorgeous barbaric Two masks stand together And the shadow of a leaf falls through them Marking the wall where they are not From hat tip to shoulder tip From elbow to sword hilt The leaf falls The shadows mingle Blur together Slide along the wall and disappear  Gold of mosaics and candles And night blackness lurking in the ceiling beams Saint Mark s glitters with flames and reflections A cloak brushes aside And the yellow of satin Licks out over the colored inlays of the pavement Under the gold crucifixes There is a meeting of hands Reaching from black mantles Sighing embraces bold investigations Hide in confessionals Sheltered by the shuffling of feet   Gorgeous barbaric In its mail of jewels and gold Saint Mark s looks down at the swarm of black masks And outside in the palace gardens brown leaves fall Flutter Fall Brown And yellow streaked with brown  Blue black the sky over Venice With a pricking of yellow stars There is no moon And the waves push darkly against the prow Of the gondola Coming from Malamocco And streaming toward Venice It is black under the gondola hood But the yellow of a satin dress Glares out like the eye of a watching tiger Yellow compassed about with darkness Yellow and black Gorgeous barbaric The boatman sings It is Tasso that he sings The lovers seek each other beneath their mantles And the gondola drifts over the lagoon aslant to the coming  dawn But at Malamocco in front   POETRY A Magazine of Verse In Venice behind Fall the leaves Brown And yellow streaked with brown They fall Flutter Fall Amy Lowell   PRAISE OF LOVE  In time of hunger and drought Love is glad For Love is food and wine and fire The eyes of love are gentle as the doves The face of Love fairer than flowers is Her breasts make challenge mutely for caresses Her loins are hollowed for her lover s rest Her hands make new life spring beneath their touch Her lips are velvet smooth and made for kisses Her hair like golden serpents writhes about Down o er her flanks a soft and shining shower Her eyes are pools where violets are drowned Her voice is music and her mind is wisdom Her odor is a heaven sweet perfume Sweeter than woods in spring or summer gardens The tired rest themselves against her heart The feast of a thousand vineyards is hers And the flowers wherewith she decks herself Shall never die shall never die The gardens of God have their seasons Flowerless and fruitless half the year But the gardens of Love are everlasting Their flowers and fruit are eternal The strong man s power is but for a day When it goes tis but as a tale that s told But the power of Love is mightier than the sword s And it stays while life does   Riches come hardly and go swiftly leaving nothing But Love comes early and abides forever A blossom decked altar is the bed of Love Her festivals the sacraments of life The song of songs is the song of Love Ever sung yet never ending The song of Love is the song of life  PRAYER  Many are the cries sent upward to God s throne The cry for justice comes out of the depths The depths of woe The cry for mercy from the depths of sin And mothers of slain soldiers cry for courage Courage to bear the ills that go with life The children pray with souls all innocent  Yet mindful of each little trespass wrought They pray for a pure heart and soldiers pray That God may save their dear ones from war s plagues And beggars pray for bread or pleasant weather But from the high high places of the world The prayer when prayer there is is all for power Power and glory and honor forever nothing more  Jean O Brien SUMMER IN CORONADO  Great sun why are you pitiless All day your glance is sharp and keen Upon the hills that once were green Where summer sere and passionless Now lies brown frocked against the sky And makes of them her resting place For she has drunk the valleys dry You never turn away your face And I who love you cannot bear Your long barbaric searching look Down through the low cool flights of air Your tirelessness I cannot brook For all my body aches with light And you have glutted me with sight With flooding color made me blind To that which is more soft and kind Till I have longed for clouds to roll Between you and my naked soul O great beloved hide away That I may miss you for a day  Marguerite Wilkinson   AT THIRTY HE SINGS OF A DAY IN SPRING  Swift as the push of wind could drive me I ran the brookside Curving in and turning out Toward the reaches of the distant meadows Flaunting in the sun Beyond my sight  I cannot tell you why I ran  I was ten years old And that morning Mother kissed me And Father smiled a curious smile Then both of them turned me loose Within the meadow White and green and gold With the startled color of the May  Perhaps they knew I should find the path To the orchard On the sheltered southern hill Where peach and apple bloom were mingled  Perhaps they knew That dark would find me Waking from my dreams   Of meadows infinite and eternal Greener far than the meadows of the earth Where I could run forever  Perhaps they knew that I would waken Dusted over pollen scented With my eyes like meadow pools Mirroring the stars  DOWN THE WIND  Down the wind The snipes are calling And running fast On many gleaming beaches  And slender birches Flaunting in the wind Are green and silver girls Dancing to the calling To the calling of the snipes Along the gleaming beaches  Clinton Joseph Masseck   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  BRANDED  To that typical plainsman L S  The spell of the desert is on me it s got me fast and sure And I must leave the easy trail to follow the desert s lure I m marked with the signs of its branding wild eye black  lip raw skin Through hunger thirst through hell I ll go to follow the cursed thing  What is the spell of the desert how can a fellow say Is it the sun on the drifting sands of a blinding burning day Perhaps the hiss of a rattler coiled in a clump of mesquite Or maybe the little dust devils running on twisted feet  You say it s the blaze of colors that come when daylight goes Colors that never had a name and only the desert knows And then the sudden drop of night so still you can hear the  tread Of a coyote nosing the water hole or the turn of your broncho s head I tell you the spell is none of these it s something a man can t see But what it is that haunts the place you will never learn  from me I only know it s branded me this much I can understand And I must leave the easy trail to wander that burning land   Branded  The spell of the desert is on me it s got me fast and sure And I must leave the easy trail to follow the desert s lure I m marked with the signs of its branding wild eye black  lip raw skin Through hunger thirst through hell I ll go to follow the cursed thing  Amy Sebree Smith  QUATRAINS  THE WOLF AT THE DOOR  The Russian traveler in the story lest The wolf attack casts out his precious store So we surrender all that we hold best To drive back him who clamors at the door  THE ANNIVERSARY  With no observance is my birthday set From other times aside But once each year would God I could forget Comes back the night I died  Ruth Hall   NIGHT FOR ADVENTURES  Sometimes when fragrant summer dusk comes in with scent of rose and musk And scatters from their sable husk the stars like yellow grain Oh then the ancient longing comes that lures me like a roll of drums To follow where the cricket strums his banjo in the lane  And when the August moon comes up and like a shallow silver cup Pours out upon the fields and roads her amber colored beams A leafy whisper mounts and calls from out the forest s moss grown halls To leave the city s somber walls and take the road o dreams A call that bids me rise and strip and naked all from toe to lip To wander where the dewdrops drip from off the silent trees And where the hairly spiders spin their nets of silver fragile thin And out to where the fields begin like down upon the breeze  Into a silver pool to plunge and like a great trout wheel and lunge   Night for Adventures  Among the lily bonnets and the stars reflected there With face upturned to lie afloat with moonbeams rippling round my throat And from the slimy grasses plait a chaplet for my hair  Then leaping from my rustic bath to take some winding meadow path Across the fields of aftermath to run with flying feet And feel the dewdrop weighted grass that bends beneath me as I pass Where solemn trees in shadowy mass beyond the highway meet  And plunging deep within the woods among the leaf hung solitudes Where scarce one timid star intrudes into the breathless gloom Go leaping down some fern hid way to scare the rabbits in their play And see the owl a phantom gray drift by on silent plume  To fling me down at length and rest upon some damp and mossy nest And hear the choir of surpliced frogs strike up a bubbling tune And watch above the dreaming trees Orion and the Hyades And all the stars like golden bees around the lily moon   Then who can say if I have gone a gipsying from dusk till dawn In company with fay and faun where firefly lanterns gleam And have I danced on cobwebs thin to Master Locust s mandolin Or have I spent the night in bed and was it all a dream  Victor Starbuck  THE FAERIES FOOL  Thus spake my faerie sponsors long ago Weaving wild spells that I might do their will Laughing they spoke and yet my mother wept Cuddling me closer still  We name thee Fey heart little newborn soul Go thou and serve the world s most foolish things Whistle through thumbs to moldy garden seeds And brush the wood gnat s wings  We give thee cobwebs and a reel of dreams To pay the tavern s score for wine and bread Go thou small soul and spend thy elfin coin And make thy storm swept bed  Anita Fitch   ADVENTURING  There little swimmer that was a good game fight If you d gone down again but all s well now The shore is close now scarce a quarter mile And we ll be drinking tea before you know it  Slow work girlie it does seem slow I know But that s no matter so we re moving in The wind I think is holding us back a little  Odd that there isn t anyone in sight It seems we ll have to make it by ourselves We must keep moving in My arm my arm It s all right now I see it s moving yet But I can t feel it Strange   This wind   The water Is fishy did you notice that It smells And then it pulls keeps pulling pulling Cold  No dear that s not the way we go not down That was a strange idea to go down  Still curly head it seems quite simple too You always had uncommon notions dear And figured out such strange adventures always This new idea may be very fine   It may be even wild enough for you My little wild one For there will be caves You ll pick us out a little wonder cave With golden portals golden as your hair It will be very cozy with four rooms And always the clear cool water you and I Will find weird flowers in strange and secret gardens You and I  Yes you are always right We ll go my love we ll go adventuring  GOLDENROD  Heigh ho the proud batallions That tread the gleaming hill That muster for the sun their king To do his flaming will  With golden pennants streaming With myriad brazen spears They drive the fleeing summer Over the fallen years  John Russell McCarthy   ISAAC AND REBEKAH  I  In the cave which he had paid for with his gold Had Abraham laid Sarah unto rest And being past the ordinary old Sent forth his steward on a far behest To bring from out his fatherland a wife Of their own kindred for his son But life Ebbed from him ere the man had long been gone Yet died he calmly dreaming all was done Because he wished it and so loved his son  Isaac was gentle his full beard was soft His eyes were often on the sky and oft They wandered o er the grass for much he mused Though rarely spoke in ample robes was used Reserved to walk A long slow summer dawn His youth had stretched beyond the usual bound Most men are fathers ere his heart had found Preluding stir desire that to be born Grows urgent Now one afternoon he went To sigh out in lone fields the sadness pent By the day s toil for they had been his friends Who were his parents Age at times descends As youth to fill her place grows ripe when though Offices be mutually transferred yet no Breach ever yawns though he tend who was tended   Fresh start they never made since nothing ended Till even the last parting had proved kind And underneath a sycamore reclined Isaac thought of them till he ceased to think For all the cordial stillness of the weather Had passed into his soul and link by link Had melted sorrow s chain Attuned together The fields the trees the dipping dales and tops Russet and mellow with their ripening crops The far off stretches where rich aliens dwelt The sky s vast peace worked through him till he felt So happy that he laughed there to himself A governed laugh of sound uneager health The warm content of every wholesome limb Then when at sundown hints were borne to him Of tinkling camel bells and dogs that barked He backed his ear with hollow hand and harked Saying A coming of much folk is clear Rising Tis from the north east that they near Then smiled for all at once his mind awoke With bliss poured in as red wine brims a cup Swam richly round conceiving beauty s charm The presence of a person sooth as balm Perpetual in his tent So he walked on To meet them with wild heart Shapes wound anon Up from the vale where deepened more and more The phantom dusk Twas Eliezer sate The foremost camel but the next in state   Isaac and Rcbekah  Surpassed all others to her whom it bore The trusty steward questioned prompt replied She veiled herself forthwith Holding his side Isaac was forced to stop and they stopped then While down she lighted mong the serving men Who parted and half running forth she came Surely though soft a new voice called his name He waited to make sure She was so young But lo her veil hung in her way his tongue Seemed tied she tripped tripped stumbled fell too soon Was touching to the earth her brow in sign She owned him lord Mute at portent malign He sobbed ran raised and saw her face a boon For utter wonder She was very fair And seemed but frail to carry so much hair Strung pearls looped round her brow by tens and twelves From tapping soft brown temples scarce had ceased Her eyes abashed looked up despite themselves They did so long to see and were so pleased  Seeing to rest on him He did not kiss She kissed him curbed the impulse forward rushed And gasped while he blushed even as she blushed For thought grew purple with conceiving his Strange backwardness to kiss Suffered to doubt Hangs she in two minds or to cry or pout There is not time their lips are mutually met Till laughter part both radiant faces wet Since joy robs grief of tears has all and wants more yet   At length he found that his held both her hands Straight to be worshipped gently smoothed of dust For she had soiled them falling Who would thrust On such absorption Eliezer stands And waits till they are speckless then is heard But hardly listened to though duties said He has commenced his tale stopped when a word The first time uttered turned his master s head With Ah Rebekah Is thy name so sweet Methinks I heard it broken at my feet Stooping to raise thee Pieced again at last Twas slow in coming for it came too fast Even as thou didst late to come to me Yet am I grown for such felicity I feel still childish Thus with many a break Toward the roused tents they through the gloaming make The steward tells his tale is questioned now And oft ignored before the time allow A perfect answer So to Sarah s tent They came though stopping all the way they went  She was inside he had not longed for this And yet it seemed to pass the bounds of bliss Enraptured he could neither act nor think But the whole weary journey forced her sink Upon a camel s saddle draped with skins All of a heap bead work and quilted things Bunched up about her languid form her head   Isaac and Rebekah  Seeking with droop and loll a needed bed Two heavy lids had shut him from her eyes But one hand warm in his kept paradise About her spirit while the novel scent Of new surroundings nourished its content Her nurse saw now and understood her case Calling for water which his hand maids brought Softly she bathed the almost sleeping face Isaac by this made capable of thought Ordered the daintiest feast his stores could yield Sent for soft cushions built a pillow throne Before which all devotion down he kneeled Pressing choice morsels to her drowsy lips Wooing their toil as rivals of his own Or in the pure milk dipped her finger tips To please himself which pleased her most of all But still the head would obstinately fall  Fain of those pillows So her nurse must plead That sleep not food is now the crying need Like one who doth receive unlooked for gift While friends uncord it sits and cannot lift Finger to help them he whose full veins beat Whose eyes swim kneels while care uncases feet Plunges them in a basin of bright gold Despite their timid shrinking from the cold His worship of their beauty freed the tongue Of the old crone as she the towels wrung To tell how at a stream that morning they   Had halted when by parasol green shaded Her mistress traced its windings some short way To where supported by each arm she waded Over worn hummocked rock Pools floored with sand She lingered at for pleasure paced alone But out flew like a scared bird either hand Soon as her toes encountered the least stone With Ah Oh frightened laughing at her fear To find help still so opportunely near A special toilet afterward went through To please thee please her all that we could do Might barely that my lord the water failed And for it would distort her was assailed With numberless rebukes half laughing things Which wed the rippling mischief that it sings All this as flowers the dew he mute receives Watches lithe arms glide forth from quilted sleeves Watches two women lift her up and hold Her off the ground while broidered fold on fold Rich skirts creep down the white stoled tender form Till her feet droop above an emptied nest As some young almost mother bird s whose rest Deserts her there till she can lay her eggs She hovers just above with pendant legs Until her time be come and will not stray Thus speakingly suspended those feet sway Helplessly there Then at his breast he caught They moved her as a corpse is moved he thought   Straight as by fresh disaster overtaken He sees her tresses from their pearled net shaken Come tumbling forth in downy deluge black  A bed had been preparing at the back Beyond the region of the lamp s warm glow Whispering maids glid dimly to and fro Till called at last they round their mistress bent Then bore her o er hush carpets through the tent And gave her leave to sleep long as she could Laughed and withdrew to share the dainty food Isaac sat long on through the night aloof From the rich bed where that soft breather slept Though she was near him under the same roof He like a bodiless soul one station kept External things usurped him through and through His lips burned not to kiss his voice to woo Nor for a great embrace did his arms ache Sheer bliss retained only his eyes awake Only his ears alert only this thought Which could to clearness by no means be brought How weighed with his good fortune he was naught  II  Ah wakes she Nay but in her slumber speaks For back in Haran gladdening friends her mind   Goes through its smiling kingdom like a queen Bestowing praise and finding all things well At even now wends staidly down to draw The water duly and perchance these words Confused beyond his skill once blessed the ear Of faithful Eliezer smiled she thus Ah time goes fast with her if it be so For now at last her words are audible Thou art our sister be thou mother fair Unto a thousand million so they said She smiles O nurse and it may be I shall With that appears content and journeys on And happy journeys doubtless all the way A second time from Haran thitherward  He knelt enraptured at so gracious sign Lay there no wonder here this virgin come So far and trustfully for his content From inward question overwhelmed he ceased Yet marvelled in believing borne to awe Yearned stranded on that utmost shore of thought Half drowned thus some exhausted seaman late Sport of proud crests on the high running sea Scans long with still bleared eyes deep wooded slopes Close folded up at dusk where ocean ends So his mind fed not yet but gazed and gazed By slow degrees assured of what it saw Lie curled together hugging ease Rich forms   Prepared for motherhood and ready now Wait neath warm wraps as under snow the glebe Lowly and safe She lies with face laid soft To nest in both her hands which hollow down The pillow while her hair mingles with night One darkness one deep odor one repose Divine with promise Evenly breathe her lips Her face set to cleave the gulf of sleep As on tense rigid wings the kite high up Holds its own way through limitless blue noon To watch her silent progress through an hour Real yet a vision drew him through flown days And sucked him down like a grown plant shrunk back Within its earliest compass green and fresh Till in his brooding trance diminished he Transformed into a lightsome child once more Found native just that way of settling down To slumber which her weary limbs re found Yet not to sleep to hide is thus crouched low Ishmael bidding him They are alone Strayed from the tents in bright discovery Of common things and neighbor banks and trees He then as bidden neath a boulder curled Watches his elder planted firm await On sturdy legs among stout thistle clumps A goat that butts full tilt and all too weak For such suspense loses the feel of it Ishmael triumphant Not afraid had laughed   Himself then smiled from absence coming back Nor tried to explain why he was found so calm Again shrunk up with fear bound hand and foot Upon an altar laid at noon he aches A knife arrests its plunge so long that fear Escapes him thus lies on in sweet content Even as she does till the angel voice Cries Abraham Abraham bringing him his soul Truant as seemed a long while strange with awe The servants laugh outside his dreams disperse But still he kneels spell bound beside the bed His need of prayer frustrating utterance Yet sensible what stars watch oe r the tent Silence and stillness give him strength to feel His babyhood and boyhood manhood one With her to be possessed soon with his bride In attitude relation and resource One under heaven one in peace and hope He knows his father s wealth lies round him safe His mother s life had used this furniture Unto his offspring for unnumbered years These pastures wells and pleasant distances Are pledged by Elohim It seems enough His spirit feels indeed too much too much  A joyous wedding theirs in the old days No stint of cheer to welcome limit none Yet tardily the promise worked for them   Rebekah waited long ere she grew great Then went with twins who strove within her womb Made anxious thus enquiring of the Lord To her was straight returned for comfort this Two nations are within thy womb and from Thy bowels shall two peoples separate The one people shall be stronger than the other And the elder he shall serve the younger brother Now when the day of her deliverance was Red and all over as an hairy coat Forth came the first child Esau called they him But since his brother grasped him by the heel As he came forth the second him they named Jacob for that he held him by the heel Her women had much mirth to witness it Bringing the sturdy boys for her to see When eased of pain yea merry were their hearts Yet more for that meek mother fears her babes And shrinks from having them laid close to her So timid she But when the younger yearns And stretches both precocious greedy hands Towards the fairest face yet seen him swift She takes and holds henceforward next her heart For thus her soul had taken bent to love Those who lay claim to service but to dread Those who in self reliance ask for naught Even since a child she first had wended out At herding time down to the village well   Holding her mother s hand had picked her way  Warned to avoid the puddles choice of shoes Silk broidered by maternal love and pride And seen the poorer children splash and wade And not been bold and learned no daring ways But had grown patient sage a nurse of dolls Who late at length was Jacob s fond fond nurse But could not love her hardy Esau so  Thus those whose life was peace gave birth to strife Out of the meek came greed and by content Were clamoring nations reared to age long war  T Sturge Moore  EDITORIAL COMMENT  NEW BANNERS  HA T are we to do with war all these wars  and rumors of wars which absorb man s in  terests and energies waste his treasure and  interrupt his proper modern business the  business of making a more habitable world and more beautiful and noble men and women to live in it What are we to do with this stupid and violent interruption which fills our eyes with ruin our ears with noise our nostrils with sickening stenches and our minds with pompous and brutal melodrama War which as it destroys and maims and kills is in no other detail so disgusting as in its monstrous pretense of heroism Heroism the big bully merely shows us how many heroes we have by destroying them merely brings out tragic evidence of the heroism which existed in its victims before the guns mangled them heroism which should have been preserved for the slow struggles of peace  Europe will be born again through this war thus I have heard people rhapsodize she will rise purified and illumined etc etc in minute detail Ah when the artificial stimulus ceases that produced all the bitter rapture and agony will not men and nations have to resume their old tasks their old lives but with heavier burdens to carry and under harsher conditions than before As Bernard Shaw s war hero says in O Flaherty V C   I see no great differ myself It s all the fight and the excitement and when that quiets down they ll go back to their natural devilment and be the same as ever  Or as Gaudier Brzeska the young French sculptor of genius who died in the trenches said more nobly  With all the destruction that works around us nothing is changed even superficially Life is the same strength the moving agent that permits the small individual to assert himself  The bursting shells the volleys wire entanglements projectors motors the chaos of battle do not alter in the least the outlines of the hill we are besieging It would be folly to seek artistic emotions amid these little works of ours this paltry mechanism which serves as a purge to over numerous humanity  So there is more joy in heaven over one little sweat shop sewing girl who rebels than over ninety and nine V C s won at the point of a bayonet And there is more hope for humanity in the present very definite movement for increase of beauty and joy in our lives than in the triumphant march of a thousand armies  One conspicuous phase of this movement the many sided struggle to abolish poverty may not be in POETRY S province but another phase the impulse toward civic beauty is the beginning of a richer life in this country which will bring a renaissance of all the arts Therefore the sense of joy of spiritual expansion which came to me during a recent visit one fine summer Sunday to Chicago s new Municipal Recreation Pier seemed to bear a direct relation to POETRY Here in this beautiful assemblage of vast halls and towers out door courts and colonnades reaching out into the cool blue lake as a spacious refuge from dust and heat from toil and struggle and ugliness here was the proof   of a new movement in our democracy proof that the people are beginning to express in definite concrete form their demand for beauty  In other cities I should have found other motives for this train of thought even in Chicago I might have taken my text from the long chain of playground parks or the new architectural framing in of Grant Park both prophetic of the future beauty of one of the great cities of the world Everywhere the public impulse toward city planning toward more open spaces and park areas more free music and dancing more masques pageants expositions and other festivals of peace all this is part of the real forward march of modern armies the real struggle of our time toward the light  The organization of society for rapid effective and beautiful movement in peace as hitherto it has frequently been organized for such movement in war that is the modern problem a problem worth the devotion of our best minds our richest treasure Such devotion will destroy war at last by stripping it of its ancient glamour Men live by dreams by the ever elusive dream of beauty Give them dreams more beautiful and heroic than their long cherished vision of the glory of war and they will put away war like a worn out garment and unite for conquests really glorious for the advance toward justice and beauty in the brotherhood of nations H M   CORRESPONDENCES  The annoyance of being forever coupled with something or somebody that has gone before is a part of the artist s reward for creating something worth while one is never curious about the ancestry of mediocrity And yet it is inevitable that a work of genius should start a train of associations The mind instinctively searches for the thing that is like a function that is in itself creative is only set in motion by an active creative source that death which is mediocrity is incapable of imparting any such impetus And this is one reason why one never cares to trace the parentage of bad work in fact it has no lineage As I once heard a painter say Good pictures are alike only the bad ones are different Certainly this is equally true of poetry irrespective of all distinctions of school creed or form  Yet the novelty of work truly creative always excites suspicion the suspicion that it must have been taken from somewhere or copied from something In the search for correspondences one is too apt to trace exact sources to apply the epithet derivative to work which has been done quite independently of all knowledge of that from which it is supposed to be derived The over zealous critic who insists upon this method of pigeon holing needs to be told that the creative mind is creative it has no need of a copy book it does not need to stem directly from this or that influence Artistic achievements may be as accidental and as independent as scientific discoveries At least the seed from which the flower blossomed was not sown overnight   Correspondences  On the other hand this constant reiteration of influences and correspondences should not annoy the artist overmuch He must remember even though he be given fifty seven different varieties of forebears that there is a long tradition to the effect that the poet or artist is myriad minded He must in all truth be a complex rather than a simple creature and it is not at all surprising that he should shelter many diverse spirits under the cloak of an inclusive personality  A C H  REVIEWS  TWO ANTHOLOGIES  Some Imagist Poets I916 Houghton Mifflin Co  Georgian Poetry I913 I915 Poetry Bookshop London  and Putnam New York  If we could only forget schools and labels now and then and assume an Olympian attitude toward modern poetry the superior attitude of the high gods who look before and after and who inhale beautiful words as eagerly as the scent of flowers beautiful words and fleet emotions which outrun the words or sail up and away What would the gods find in these two books what keen and perfumed air  It does not make much difference what instrument a son of the gods sings to so long as it fits his song He may cut his own reed by the river or find an old violin in a junk shop or play the church organ or pound the bass drum or whisper through the elusive piccolo anything so long as he chooses   the right mood for his lingering or leaping or dancing words  the right music for the feeling that outruns them Or in  the words of the late Remy de Gourmont à propos of the  symbolistes translated in the preface of Some Imagists  The sole excuse which a man can have for writing is to write down himself to unveil for others the sort of world which mirrors itself in his individual glass He should create his own aesthetics and we should admit as many aesthetics as there are original minds and judge them for what they are and not for what they are not  If these two books represent two tendencies in modern poetry the conservative and the liberal they do not include either the extreme radicals on the one side or the extreme formalists on the other If the imagists are less elliptical than the choric school the spectrists etc the Georgians are less rhetorical than the Victorians And in both volumes one finds now and then some poet creating if not quite his own aesthetics at least his own mode his own personal magic  I find this to mention two extreme instances not only in H D s lithe nude lyric The Shrine so wonderful in its bright stark purity but also to a certain degree in Gordon Bottomley s brief tragedy King Lear s Wife which marches in Elizabethan draperies H D using a new manner with perfect virtuosity perhaps succeeds in creating her own aesthetics Throughout her group there is in her feeling for sand dunes and rocky sea swept headlands a completeness of sympathy which reminds one of Emily Bronte s love of the moors She is not outside of them but a part of them a spirit informing them wild and free and fleet   like some nymph of long ago And her art is the fit vesture of her spirit it falls in straight sculptural lines like the drapery of certain archaic statues The Shrine tells the formidable allure of beauty as the very winds and waves might tell it  You are useless O grave O beautiful The landsmen tell it I have heard You are useless  And the wind sounds with this And the sea Where rollers shot with blue Cut under deeper blue  You are not forgot O plunder of lilies Honey is not more sweet Than the salt stretch of your beach  Mr Bottomley uses an instrument more familiar but he strikes it in his own way and forces us to confess at last that he has achieved the impossible by setting up beside Shakespeare s figure of Goneril a darkly vivid portrait of that sinister princess in youth And in doing this with all the old aids of the tragic muse a stately long accepted measure an ancient legendary tale and scene royal characters and violent deeds he yet plays the rich old instrument for his own purposes achieves his own personal style  If these are cases in which the special magic is achieved one finds in both volumes more than one instance of too self conscious experiment which however interesting still retains signs of effort remains a study rather than a poem A conspicuous example among the radicals is Miss Lowell s   much talked of rhapsody in polyphonic prose Spring Day whose brightly colored pattern of interwoven rhythms set with glittering rhymes achieves an admirable virtuosity if you will but not quite the authentic magic of perfect art And at the other end of the scale Lascelles Abercrombie s two act play The End of the World is a too deliberate effort to adjust the talk of modern peasants to blank verse high flown poetic language soliloquies and other trappings more or less artificial and unconvincing  If we go through the two anthologies in search of the achieved personal style the special magic where shall we pause  The imagist volume perhaps tempts us first because these poets have stript off many old impedimenta They are at least more simple and direct in presentation than the Georgians and their cadenced rhythms are less bound by metrical rules Of them all H D is no doubt the perfect imagist the only danger which besets her stark style being that which assails all perfection the danger of becoming too keen and cold too abstract too inhuman John Gould Fletcher has more warmth though he also is always the artist Sensitive vibrant aware of strange colors in nature and of the wildness of humanity against them he finds in Arizona our wonderland a congenial subject In the work of D H Lawrence one feels always an abiding sorrow an agony of sympathy with suffering men and women expressed in low far sounding music as of wood winds No one has felt each bitter wound of this war more cruelly than he no one has touched the subject with more tragic beauty than he in   Two Anthologies  Erinnyes And Amy Lowell gives us a beautifully patterned poem in Patterns a finely composed decorative picture rich in color and rhythmic in its handling of background and draperies so to speak its movement of repeated lines around a little eighteenth century figure whose passion is held by the poet admirably in tone Richard Aldington has two or three fine poems especially the filmy rhymed lyric After Two Years but nothing so bewitching as Lesbia Nor is  F S Flint quite at his best Of the Georgians we find Rupert Brooke in his most high spirited mood of joy reaching its climax in the immortal sonnet The Soldier now so much quoted that people forget it was first printed in POETRY We find Walter de la Mare attaining in Full Moon and Off the Ground almost the gaiety and intangible grace of certain earlier poems And William H Davies in The Moon Thunderstorms and Sweet Stay at Home gives us that kind of eighteenth century clarity and grace more like Goldsmith than anyone else which distinguishes his best work In the group of James Stephens is one poignant little masterpiece Dierdré John Masefield is represented by The Wanderer one of the best of his briefer narratives of ships and the sea done in sounding quatrains of long eloquent lines And another poet who swings all the old conventions with the strength of an athlete and the skill of an adept Ralph Hodgson appears with the two poems which have made him famous  The Bull and The Song of Honor Students of modern poetry will require both these books  H M   NEW BOOKS OF VERSE  Cadences by F S Flint The Poetry Book shop London  On first going over this beautifully printed little volume I asked myself was this all Mr Flint had to say But after reading it again and again I found that he had much to say much that was worth saying  There is an unsensational artistic courage in almost the whole book which can hardly be overpraised The poet faces his heart his soul and his mood He faces one or the other in Chrysanthemums in Fragment in To a Woman and in the beautiful and rhapsodic The Star  In Malady the author has achieved vision It is a faithful rendering of a vision done with artistic refinement and economy I believe it will rank with the better work of the sensual visionists Cézanne Brancusi etc in the present renaissance  Not everything in the book is artistically satisfactory Beautiful as The Swan is it is nevertheless tainted with a slight affectation an unconscious imitation of the French symbolists This is more true of Roses and less of London I believe that even in Accident Mr Flint does not speak freely in his own voice You see beyond us and you see nothing really means You look at me and pretend not to see me And part of April is not convincing The roots hear and they quiver etc I have an impression also that the pessimistically toned poems with the exception of Regret are not quite sincere which of course does not mean   that Mr Flint may not be a sincere pessimist outside of his poems  Taken as a whole this poet s gift of artistic courage clothed in beauty wins him a place near Pound H D Aldington and Fletcher It will help build the poetry of the future to which Masters has brought his gift of fire Sandburg that of social vision and protest and Amy Lowell the important gift of strong color yes of gaudiness I believe that the art of the future including poetry will be simple fresh and strongly colored and will be understood and loved by the ignorant as well as by the most cultivated It will be a popular art in the finest sense of the word  I am afraid I have not implied sufficiently how much I like most of the poems in the little volume But most of the reviews of imagists books by sympathizers have been so one sided that one is inclined to emphasize the other side for a change  The readers of POETRY are of course familiar with many of Mr Flint s poems Here is a new one Melody in which the slight vagueness actually helps the poem as it emphasizes the writer s deep emotion  I was making melody of my love Knowing what it was to be A nightingale In the dead stillness of the night Among the apple boughs  I was making melody of my love Even though the organ of my voice Could scarcely follow Yet it was melody That leaped and soared Gliding from note to note   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  It trembled in her ears And she was moved To cling to me more closely  And then she raised her golden head And laughed Not knowing how to take the day and hour The sun shone and the birds were singing In the new budded trees Nor why it gave relief  Max Michelson  In the Town and On the Road by Douglas Goldring Sel  wyn amp Blount London  A few poems in these two volumes qualify Mr Goldring  as a poet and are reason enough perhaps for the serious mention given him by Mr Ezra Pound in his Status Rerum of April For the rest I think he is a victim of a kind of false facility which may defeat even unusual talent and is never to be taken for the real ease of beauty the elemental coveted ease of a poem by Blake or Verlaine for example  On the Road and In the Toiun offer some new poems and some reprinted from earlier volumes one of which Streets POETRY reviewed two years ago with the criticism that his portrayal of London streets came dangerously near to photography That opinion seems relevant here for hasn t the camera just this vice of facility It plays the trick but too cheaply thus the anomaly of the movies as an art  Mr Goldring s poems however have too much the charm of life to be completely and efficiently photographic And one quarrels with him not for this charm which in life might suffice but because having it he is content so often   New Books of Verse  to stop short of the rigor of style which in art is essential One quarrels with him because having in a few instances obeyed the sterner demands of style he is content far too often with a triteness of word of rhyme of rhythm and even of thought that gives to his lines the effect of jogging along in the manner of what is quaintly known as society verse  The lamp gives a softened glow that is like a caress And the fire gleams cozy and red in the open grate Warming your bosom and neck and your shimmering dress And the people begin to arrive for it s five to eight  I m not very near you at dinner it wouldn t be wise  And so he goes on to eyes and then clucking to the horse and flapping the reins a little he reaches the end of the third quatrain and calls the three Dinner Time  Now that is as bad as any though not so satirically clever as some or so graceful as others but its faults I think are too prevalent in the work of a poet who in a more expensive effort tells us he has the moon under his arm He should harness then to the horses of the moon or of some proud sphere that he may give more often that sense of restraint of curb as of skill in league with impetuousness This greater elegance this austerity in company with grace exists in the lovely poem Calle Memo O Loredan which represents Mr Goldring in the Catholic Anthology and which I should like to quote here had it not already appeared in POETRY And there are traits in other poems too that make one resent keenly the less distinguished aspects of his verse  Dorothy Dudley   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The Middle Miles and Other Poems by Lee Wilson Dodd  Yale University Press  This book of quiet poems has a certain grace and charm Its soft music conveys the soliloquies the patterned meditations of a man sensitive to the more delicate aspects of comedy and pathos Neither the tragic nor the comic is here but the smile and the sigh are sincere and the voice has a low sweet resonance The poet s light touch his individual way of saying things and his sense of the permeating and underlying humor of this earthly scheme make him a good companion  His subjects are varied but nearly all are chosen from modern life Even Maitre Arouet s Complaint is not only a vivid sketch of Voltaire as his own father sees him but suggestive of many another wayward son of genius who  bleeds quicksilver From any casual scratch  The Lament of a New England Art Student Mirella Dances Was It a Leaf and others are also studies of temperament the war brings out a few protests and a number of poems especially The Temple probe into the mystery of life Indoor poems all no doubt poems of a scholar and a gentleman but a real man nevertheless  The book suffers from a helter skelter succession of subjects and a confusing arrangement of page headings though certain details of make up especially the paper cover are in excellent taste Some of its best poems are familiar to our readers Here is a new one Night Armies   New Books of Verse  The street is gray with rain The gutters run surcharged All night I heard war chariots sweep the plain In one long rolling wave of fight Now it is dawn and I can see No battle wreck no littered plain Where do wild night armies flee The street is gray with rain And down the street an ash cart jolts Ponderous and I turn away God how the ghost in man revolts Against the day H M The Jew to Jesus and Other Poems by Florence Kiper Frank Mitchell Kennerley  With this modern Jewess intense vitality and passionate conviction demand utterance in a kind of solemn chant as with some of the ancient prophetesses of her race She was born too late for Deborah s heroic simplicity of mood and divine splendor of lyricism but something of Deborah s spirit is in her  The book is largely juvenilia and even the best things in it are more remarkable for their promise of power than for what they actually achieve One feels the drive of a big nature in them of a passion for beauty and justice which forces the muses citadel and rebukes them for idling and lays violent hands on their banners The poet s fervor becomes really lyric in triumphant moments again when the power wanes it spends itself in more or less rhythmic eloquence  The well known sonnet The Jew to Jesus published six or eight years ago in The Century is a tender expression of   inborn racial sympathies And The Song of the Women City of Huge Buildings We Have Done Him to Death  are equally fervent expressions of social sympathies But  perhaps The Movies You and Night mood are keener more  finely tempered poems The last ends thus  Closer Closer What are we A shifting breeze That the winds of the world will gather Yes and these Our souls are separate Oh as a little breeze We shall blow into the darkness Shelter me from space The night is too vast a place  H M Today and Tomorrow by Charles Hanson Towne George  H Doran Co A letter from the publishers calls this book a volume of soundly worthy American verse on modern native themes  Of course the author is not responsible for the damning phrase but he is in danger of falling into line with tendencies noticeable in much magazine verse which it describes with unconsciously delightful accuracy With some men poetry is a mood of youth or of a certain stage of experience and emotion a mood which passes Surely Mr Towne touched it in Beyond the Stars and in the present volume we have evidence of it in Mysteries Johnny Valentine and one or two others He may reach it again there is always a chance that some new experience will bring it back even though most of these poems are too soundly worthy  The brief lyric After is perhaps one of the best Drenched after rain The lilacs tremble again In the cool wind and pour Their fragrance round my door   New Books of Verse  Crushed when Love dies Bravely her spirit cries But through Life s empty room Oh the perfume  H M  The Nameless One by Anne Cleveland Cheney Frederick  A Stokes Co New York  How should a modern poet write a sixteenth century tragedy Of course it is possible to say Don t like Punch to certain other adventurers But that advice would not be final there should be a way  Of one thing however I feel sure it should not be  written in a futile imitation of Elizabethan English like  this  Beshrew me now a gadding it must go To see a limb o Satan in his cell Whatever hap the evil eye to em all I ll to my business dangle an who may  Such a diction artificializes whatever it tries to express The truest most dramatic story could never be convincing in it H M  THE SPIRIT OF 76 IN POETRY  The Spirit of the American Revolution as Revealed in the Poetry of the Period by Samuel White Patterson A M Ph D Richard G Badger This is an excellent study and compilation of American  verse from 1760 to 1783 beginning with Philip Freneau It was a period which produced full grown patriots but its poets were extremely sophomoric POETRY A M a g azin e o f V e r s e  CORRESPONDENCE  THE DEAD IRISH POETS  I Dear Editor As a friend of each of the three poets who were executed in Dublin I should like to thank through you the poets of America for the demonstration of sympathy and protest they made in Central Park New York on the afternoon of 28th June Particularly I should like to thank Mr Markham who presided Mr George Sterling and yourself for clear messages of sympathy Mr Joyce Kilmer and Miss Margaret Widdemer who spoke and read poems for the occasion and especially Mr Louis Untermeyer who read a very powerful poem of protest The three poets who were shot in Dublin in May were of the clan of Byron and Shelley and Walt Whitman they committed themselves to liberty even unto death Thomas MacDonagh speaking of his country and his country s hopes in a book which has just been published Literature in Ireland said  It is well for us that our workers are poets and our poets workers and it is well too that here still that cause which is identified without underthought of commerce with the cause of God and Right and Freedom the cause which is the great theme of our poetry may any day call the poets to give their lives in the old service  Irish literature as he wrote in the same book begins with humanity and nature Later after the English are settled in our land not humanity but the nation Kathleen ni Houlihan is our heroic theme That is true and no men   ever handled an heroic theme more heroically than they did Pearse MacDonagh and Plunkett  I understand that my good friend Joseph Campbell is writing you about Padraic Pearse So I shall say nothing here about him beyond sending you a translation of a little poem of his I discovered lately It is a cradle song from his single volume Sleep Songs and Sorrow Songs and the translation is by MacDonagh  O little head of gold O candle of my house Thou wilt guide all who travel this country  Be quiet O house And O little gray mice Stay at home to night in your hidden lairs  O moths at the window fold your wings Cease your droning O little black chafers  O plover and O curlew over my house do not travel Speak not O barnacle goose going over the mountain here  O creatures of the mountain that wake so early Stir not to night till the sun whitens over you  The monotonous repetition of the one rhyme throughout said MacDonagh speaking of the original and the swaying flow of the verse help to make this poem a perfect lullaby  I shall speak a little of MacDonagh and Plunkett  Search eagerness devotedness these are the words that spell out Thomas MacDonagh s spirit for me His life was an eager search for something to which he could give the whole devotion of his being He was a poet and a scholar an eager friend a happy hearted companion His dream was always of a lofty action It is terrible to think that we shall never see again that short figure with the scholar s    brow and the dominating nose and never listen again to his flow of learned witty and humorous talk I have one deep regret about MacDonagh it is that he left so little in poetry of the happy hearted and humorous part of his nature He knew popular life in the Irish country and the Irish country town intimately but he has put his feeling for popular and humorous life into only one poem quite completely the unique and masterly John John He has left his testament in the poem Wishes for my Son addressed to his first child Donnachd born in 1912 on St Cecilia s day  God to you may give the sight  And the clear undoubting strength  Wars to knit for single right  Freedom s war to knit at length  And to win through wrath and strife  To the sequel of my life  But for you so small and young  Born on St Cecilia s Day  I in more harmonious song  Now for nearer joys should pray  Simple joys the natural growth  Of your childhood and your youth  Courage innocence and truth  These for you so small and young In your hand and heart and tongue When one saw Joseph Mary Plunkett for the first time one was inclined to think that illness had made inroads on all his powers But he had a conqueror s will His and Mac Donagh s friendship was one of the finest things I know of MacDonagh s influence brought him from the study into affairs continually adding to his qualities of decision and command The family of Joseph Mary Plunkett had al   The Dead Irish Poets  ready their martyr the venerable Oliver Plunkett of the seventeenth century for whom a process of canonization has been set up in Rome Joseph Plunkett published one book of verse The Circle and the Sword and he has left the manuscript of another book The poem I regard as our proudest piece of national defiance is called Our Heritage  This heritage to the race of kings Their children and their children s seed Have wrought their prophecies in deed  Of terrible and splendid things  The hands that fought the hearts that broke In old immortal tragedies These have not failed beneath the skies  Their children s heads refuse the yoke  And still their hands shall guard the sod That holds their fathers funeral urn Still shall their hearts volcanic burn  With anger of the sons of God  No alien sword shall earn as wage The entail of their blood and tears No shameful price for peaceful years Shall ever part this heritage  It is stupid to think that the pride that is behind this poem can be quelled by machine guns  Another Irish poet has been condemned to death but has not been executed Sir Roger Casement Casement s life has been all action but he has left a few fine poems His Hamilcar Barca is one of the finest sonnets I have ever read it gives the figure of an unconquerable man who stands lonely against an empire  May I ask the sympathy of the poets of America for one who has been the discoverer of a great body of fine poetry   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  one who has edited and published the authentic Ossianic poetry Professor Eoin MacNeill Professor MacNeill was president of the Irish Volunteers but he used all his influence to prevent the insurrection of Easter Yet he has been sentenced to penal servitude for life At this moment a distinguished scholar is actually enduring hard labor and solitary confinement in a British prison for doing no more than that for which another man Sir Frederick Smith was made a member of the Cabinet an Attorney General and a prosecutor of rebels Let me ask sympathy too for another Irish poet and distinguished critic Darrell Figgis who has been deported and lodged in a prison camp although he had no hand in the insurrection  Padraic Colum  II  Padraic Pearse who on May 1st met his death at the hands of a British firing party was a writer of distinction both in English and Gaelic His English prose has a nervous intensity of style that was but an epiphaneia a showing forth of the spirit burning within the man himself Connacht nurtured he had a profound knowledge of modern Gaelic His anthology of Gaelic poetry which appeared serially in the pages of The Irish Review now defunct is the best thing of its kind that has yet been done The following lyric which I have translated from Suantraidhe agus Goltraidhe Sleep Songs and Laments 1914 his only book of original verse shows that he had for a long time been in love with death   The Dead Irish Poets  A rann I made in my heart  For the knight for the high king  A rann I made for my love  For the king of kings for old Death  Brighter to me than the light of day  The darkness of your clay black house  Sweeter to me than the music of doves  The quiet of your house and its everlasting silence  Joseph Campbell NOTES  Mr T Sturge Moore the distinguished English poet appears this
