I carried them From house to house, And cried them Down hot streets. The sun fell Upon my flowers, And the dust of the streets Blew over my basket. That night I slept upon the open seats Of a circus, Where all day long People had watched The antics Of a painted clown. ##20 amy lowell A  COMPARISON This man is like a mechanical toy Which runs, and streaks, and veers over the carpet, With a noise of thin edges of tin Whirring upon one another In spirals of shrillness. Even when you pick it up, The wheels of the toy continue to whirl. Grating incessantly. They beat, and wobble, and whiz, Inconceivably rapid rings of blurred spokes, And the shrill scraping pierces one's eardrums Like an auger. TREES The branches of the trees lie in layers Above and behind each other, And the sun strikes on the outstanding leaves And turns them white, And they dance like a splatter of pebbles Against a green wall. The trees make a solid path leading up in the air. It looks as though I could walk upon it If I only had courage to step out of the window. ##alanson  hartpence 21 REVENGE I seek my revenge in the stars, The quiet knowing stars. I seek my revenge in the night, The solemn truthful night. And all the infinitude of space Comes to aid in my revenge. Let those who rule, rule. They shall not rule my stars Nor me ; For I am one with my stars And my stars are one with me. Sometimes there is noise in my stars, A whirling noise of cynical joy, And all their voices are lifted with my own In the joy of revenge ; And I am one with the revenge And the revenge is one with me. We laugh with cynical joy Until our laughter echoes and echoes Into the most impenetrable depths of space And beyond— Gyrating through the unknown and beyond And awakening the dumb ears of the world's dead God To an only thought of mankind. ##22                            alanson  hartpence I laugh with joy at the mirth of my stars; 1 laugh with joy at my revenge. And there comes no voice to disturb my mirth, Except the voice of dying men Wailing on the winds of space And death-rattling against the iron-ribbed stars. But the sound of my mirth And the mirth of my stars Drown the wailing with cynical laughter. And our laughter increases Until it beats in time with the death rattle, The hymn of our joy and revenge. Thus all things laugh with my revenge— Except mankind. The very ground of earth laughs with me. The flesh of man laughs with me. The still voice of pathology tickles my ear, And I laugh my revenge with pathology, Understanding that we also shall death-rattle against the stars. But I do not fear, nor does pathology, For we are one with revenge, And revenge is death And death is truth. I sing the glory of death, The beauty and truth of death— And I sing the glory of revenge.## WILLIAM  CARLOS  WILLIAMS 23 PASTORAL The little sparrows Hop ingenuously About the pavement Quarreling With sharp voices Over those things That interest them. But we who are wiser Shut ourselves in On either hand And no one knows Whether we think good Or evil. Then again, The old man who goes about Gathering dog lime Walks in the gutter Without looking up And his tread Is more majestic than That of the Episcopal minister Approaching the pulpit Of a Sunday. These things Astonish me beyond words. ##24 WILLIAM   CARLOS   WILLIAMS PASTORAL If 1 say I have heard voices Who will believe me? "None has dipped his hand In the black waters of the sky Nor picked the yellow lilies That sway on their clear stems And no tree has waited Long enough nor still enough To touch fingers with the moon." I looked and there were little frogs With puffed out throats, Singing in the slime. THE OGRE Sweet child, Little girl with well shaped legs You cannot touch the thoughts I put over and under and around you. This is fortunate for they would Burn you to an ash otherwise. Your petals would be quite curled up. But this is all beyond you—no doubt. ##WILLIAM  CARLOS WILLIAMS 25 Yet you do feel the brushings Of the fine needles : The tentative lines of your whole body Prove it to me : So does your fear of me, Your shyness : Likewise the toy baby cart That you are pushing— And besides, mother has begun To dress your hair in a knot. These are my excuses. APPEAL You who are so mighty, Crimson salamander, Hear me once more. I lay among the half burned sticks At the edge of the fire. The fiend was creeping in. I felt the cold tips of fingers—. O crimson salamander ! Give me one little flame, One ! That I may bind it Protectingly about the wrist Of him that flung me here, Here upon the very center ! This is my song. ##26 SKIPWITH   CANNELL THE COMING OF NIGHT The sun is near set And the tall buildings Become teeth Tearing bloodily at the sky's throat ; The blank wall by my window Becomes night sky over the marshes When there is no moon, and no wind. And little fishes splash in the pools. I had lit my candle to make a song for you. But I have forgotten it for I am very tired ; And the candle. . . a yellow moth. . . Flutters, flutters, Deep in my brain. My song was about, 'a foreign lady Who was beautiful and sad, Who was forsaken, and who died A thousand years ago.' But the cracked cup at my elbow, With dregs of tea in it, Fixes my tired thought more surely Than the song I made for you and forgot. . . That I might give you this. ##SKIPWITH  CANNELL 27 I am tired. I am so tired That my soul is a great plain Made desolate, And the beating of a million hearts Is but the whisper of night winds Blowing across it. TO ENGLAND I am American. My pagan head Bows to old things. Yes ! I, in London, Heart choked with rage, Smile and bow ! As the Vandals, victorious, Cringed their unconquered way Through the streets and temples Of Imperial Rome. ##28 ROBERT  CARLTON  BROWN I I am Aladdin. Wanting a thing I have but to snap my fingers. Jinn, bring me a lady, The lady with the magic kiss That turns troubles into joys. The lady of the soft white throat And shell-tint cheeks. Ah, here you are, Lady ! Thank you, Jinn. Lady, sing to me, A song as gorgeous as the plumage of a Bird of Paradise. Music melts in your mouth Becoming vaporous perfume Utterly intoxicating me. Now you may dance for me a while. Weave a delirious design With your body, Ah, you are like a gold fish Glinting gaily Darting through sparkling waters. There, that will do, Lady. Say you love me, now. Yes, yes, I believe you. I could not doubt that voice of yours As full of the abandon of expression As your dance. And now, Lady, The magic kiss ! Ummm !   That is good. Jinn, take her away. ##ROBERT   CARLTON  BROWN 29 II The other night I dreamed Of a shimmering opalescent mermaid Sitting on a shell of mother of pearl With her tail cocked up on the edge Quite saucily. She was blowing soap bubbles, Irridescent, And flirting with a rainbow fish. I awoke with a stinging in my eyes As though one of her gay drifting bubbles Had burst in my face With a spatter of soap suds. But I could not believe that, Knowing the bite came from bitter tears, I had seen her only in a dream, And that I Could never be A rainbow fish. III I love anything ostentatious Simpler things I despise. I like to hear a nose blown with a bang See teeth picked with a flourish Watch a fat lady wabble her cargo of flesh As though it were worth a thousand dollars an ounce. I think ostentation of any sort Is just grand. ##.30 ROBERT  CARLTON   BROWN IV Big footed people Go about stepping on things ; Ideals, egos, the cosmos They crush Clod-hopperdly. I should hate to have the epidermis Of an ornithorincus On the sole of an elephantine foot. I prefer skipping lightly across egg shells In padded Chinese slippers with blue embroidered tops. V Fly speck, You are such a neat, tidy, unimportant Little thing That no one takes offense At sight of you Or mention of your name. But you irritate me With your polite little airs of decency Why don't you grow up And be something ? Even a fly speck Can aspire to be A manure heap.## WALLACE   STEVENS 31 PETER QUINCE AT THE CLAVIER I Just as my fingers on these keys Make music, so the self-same sounds On my spirit make a music, too. Music is feeling, then, not sound ; And thus it is that what I feel, Here in this room, desiring you, Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk, Is music.    It is like the strain Waked in the elders by Susanna : Of a green evening, clear and warm, She bathed in her still garden, while The red-eyed elders, watching, felt The basses of their beings throb In witching chords, and their thin blood Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna. II In the green water, clear and warm, Susanna lay, She searched The touch of springs, And found Concealed imaginings. ##32 WALLACE  STEVENS She sighed, For so much melody. Upon the bank, she stood In the cool Of spent emotions. She felt, among the leaves, The dew Of old devotions. She walked upon the grass, Still quavering. The winds were like her maids, On timid feet, Fetching her woven scarves. Yet wavering. A breath upon her. hand Muted the night. She turned— A cymbal crashed, And roaring horns. III Soon, with a noise like tambourines, Came her attendant Byzantines. They wondered why Susanna cried Against the elders by her side ; ##WALLACE STEVENS 33 And as they whispered, the refrain Was like a willow swept by rain. Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame Revealed Susanna and her shame. And then, the simpering Byzantines, Fled, with a noise like tambourines. IV Beauty is momentary in the mind— The fitful tracing of a portal ; But in the flesh it is immortal. The body dies ; the body's beauty lives. So evenings die, in their green going, A wave, interminably flowing. So gardens die, their meek breath scenting The cowl of Winter, done repenting. So maidens die, to the auroral Celebration of a maiden's choral. Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings Of those white elders ; but, escaping, Left only Death's ironic scraping. ##34 WALLACE  STEVENS Now, in its immortality, it plays On the clear viol of her memory, And makes a constant sacrament of praise, THE SILVER PLOUGH-BOY A black figure dances in a black field. It seizes a sheet—from the ground, from a bush—as if spread there by some wash-woman for the night. It wraps the sheet around its body, until the black figure is silver. It dances down a furrow, in the early light, back of a crazy plough, the green blades following. How soon the silver fades in the dust ! How soon the black figure slips from the wrinkled sheet How softly the sheet falls to the ground ! ##Others for September are Walter Conrad Arensberg, Maxwell Bodenheim, T. S. Eliot and John Gould Fletcher. OTHERS for October will be devoted to John Rodker and the CHORIC SCHOOL. ## ## ## Hand-set and printed by the workers of the Liberty Print Shop in New York City.##
