tranquillised her perceptions she balanced her eyes on it to keep the tilt of her headThe north light swam inupon her cheeksexposing the shiny down of the lipthe hollow pores on each side of the noseIn front she saw his shoulders cutting the light squareand his bent head black against the light like an auk s egg tilted on the top of a rockFor ten minutes she listened to his pencil inscribing its version of her imageRonsard m a célébré aux temps que j étais belleIt had been a sufficient sentenceShe would be what she was for another ten yearsand more than that when she diedIn the moment s complacency her eyelids felland the corners of her mouth crept upPainters are not concerned with youth or ageThey are not finally interested in your phenomena extended in time and spaceThey use it to present appearance in realityReality swallows phenomena and puffs them out in patterns discerned in the arrangement of antithesesA good painter is free of the pain of oppositesHe leads out the arrangement in reality by hand or clawHe was examining her patternArapture of the intellectstirred herHer eyesshifted from the nail headhad drawn her chin along under themShe fixed them again4 The Little Review Time ran onThe plaster round the nail head blazed and swamShe clung to the dark pointIt put out raysThe shelf above it slidand the books became an arbitrary prismShe stepped out of her bodyImmediately in place of his leaning shouldersa black rock appeareda granite bubbleand over it trembled the black starShe crossed the threshold of the sensesknowing that with the least adjustment the star and the black mountain would slide again into their terrestrial positionsIn the senses or out they were there togethertwo creaturesat perceptiontheir relation sustained by her eyes fixed till they swarted on a black starWhy should it be blackBecause of a formula the hair rose shivering along her backA mountain has roots That will do The phrase followed her about the townShe had said firstInto the darkness at the roots of the mountains curtseying about the beatsThen she considered its meaning and trimmed it into a respectable statementtraining her ear out of its predecessor until each time she saidmountainandrootsit was like a harpoon launched from a masthead into a whale at the bottom of the seaThe next day she walked along the cliffs to his houseshaping her imageShe had remembered that when he looked into her it was with no ambiguity of perceptionShe must hurry where the pace could not be forcedHer eyes picked up the nail head and held onThis time she became a

conger eelsIt seemed that it was ready to be exposedA diving bird could not part itThe moon must be caught waxing and the extreme spring tidesIn the night the water would be drawn back and in the morning she would see the thing it covered and agree for the water to cover it againShe left himexpectant to the point of tranquillityThe days passedThe house where he worked was down sixteen stone stepsand at the end of a passage all of old stones oozing at the cracksShe walked down them and looked up before leaving the uncovered air and saw alake of the moon left on the edge of the roofShe looked down and saw the roots of the house were the roots of the mountain uncovered by the moonWith the moon had risen stormgreen sheets of water were poured in shaken out and flung backuncovering what had been laid there from the foundation of the worldIn a fury of wind the sea was ripped back and exposed a rocklong darkof a precise smooth eleganceand a bird was swooping on itThe sun rolled

eyes on the nailUnder the form of a rock she had seen him nakeda pure shape among the basis of the hillsIn bird shape she had freed herself of his contactShe could now entertain it or as easily leaveShe did not know the rock s significancebut at the end of this observation would come knowledgeand out of knowledge powerHe had explored her imageHe had seen her before she had so much as arrived

Passovathe mistressHer long heavy head was divided by straight bound hairHer high firm bust was made still higher and still firmer by German corsetsShe was excessively talldue to extraordinarily long legsHer eyes were smalland not well focusedThe left was slightly distended from the long use of a magnifying glassShe was middle agedand very slow in movementthough well balancedShe wore coral in her earsa coral necklaceand many coral finger ringsThere was about her jewelry some of the tragedy of all articles that find themselves in pawnand she moved among the trays like the guardians of cemetary groundswho carry about with them some of the lugubrious stillness of the earth on which they have been standingShe dealtin most part in cameosgarnetsand a great many inlaid bracelets and cuff

trouble in StMoritzit was saidwith a wellconnected familyHe liked to seem a little eccentric and managed it simply enough while in AmericaHe wore no hatand liked to be found reading the London Times

when you are tired come back Sometimes she would make him cryTurning around she would look at him a little surprisewith lowered lidsand a light tightening of the mouth Yeshe would sayI know I m trivial well then here I goI will leave younot disturb you any longer and darting for the door he would somehow end by weeping with his head buried in her lapShe would sayTherethere why are you so nervous And he would laugh again My father was a nervous manand my mother was high strungand as for me he would not finishSometimes he would talk to her for long hoursshe seldom answeringoccupied with

in that surprised mannerdrawing her mouth togetherIn the beginning he had asked her a great many timesclinging to herand she moved about arranging her trays with a slight smileand in the end lowered her hand and stroked him gentlyHe immediately became excited Let us dance he cried I have a great capacity for happinessYesyou are very happy she said You understand don t you he asked abruptly

her life had beenif she had or had not been marriedif she had or had not known loversall that she would say wasWellyou are with medoes that tell you nothing and he had to answerNoit tells me nothing When he was sitting in the café he often thought to himselfthere s a great womanand he was a little puzzled why he thought this because his need of her was so entirely different from any need he seemed to remember having possessed beforeThere was no swagger in him about herthe swagger he had always felt for his conquests with womenYet there was not a trace of shame he was neither proud nor shy about Lydia Passovahe was something entirely differentHe could not have said himself what his feeling was but it was in no way disturbingPeople hadit is truebegun to tease him You re a devil with the ladies Where this had made him proudnow it made him uneasy Nowthere s a certain Lydia Passova for instancewho would The Little Review 13 ever have thought Tremblingfurious he would rise Soyou do

out and bury her And when he had buried her he came backhis lips twitching You loved that cat this will be a great lossHave I a memory she inquired Yes he answered Well she said quietlyfixing her

small eyes were slightly openthe leftthat had used the magnifying glasswas slightly wider than the otherFor a minute she seemed quite naturalShe had the look of one who is about to say Sit beside me Then he felt the changeIt was in the peculiar heaviness of the head sensed through despair and not touchThe high breasts looked very stillthe hands were half closeda little helplessas in life hands that were too proud tohold The drawn up limb exposed a black petticoat and a yellow stockingIt seemed that she had become hard setas in a mouldthat she rejected everything nowbut in rejecting had

Rodker J entends mon coeur qui bat C est nanan qui m appelleLaforgueLIMPID efflorescence of light gradually pervaded meNerve endings tingled and life buzzed continually like bees at a hiveVery remotesystole and diastole began quietlyVery remote and limpidand drew nearer until it burnt and quivered in jabs of red and green and chocolateThe rhythmic beat grew systematic and while before I had feared lest it should again fade vaguely into its originsnow my fear dropped and I could freely eat of the continuous and singing buzz of liferocking me endlessly through the electric blue green nightAnd the buds of my joints developed each its separate entityswarmed off from the parent so that I throbbed tiringly with my eccentric regions of systole and diastoleThe life in each joint grew more potentMy existence was less individualI was unable to seize knowledge of my identityMy originsclear and obvious to me beforelost their sharpnessI could not think or be aware of myselfToo much stress of life confused and amazed meWhat was my mother nowWillingly I would have laid hold on her entrails to tearhad she wanted to thwart mebut she was now no longer concerned to prevent meQuietly andto mea little simplyshe allowed herself to be the tool of my lifeThen I would hug myself with joy in the hot close corneras one assured of certain deliverance and who knows there is the world for himQuiet and the green and red and chocolate gave place to orange and my head was streaked with fine nets of palpitating crimson and a nimbus of fire rose from it quivering endlesslyAnd like cottonwool it remained ever between myself and the strained and despairingheart of my mother The Little Review 17 I was conscious of etheran oil bubble on its large surface of nebulae tenuous as my own life at times thinner and more tenuous evenso that I shuddered before incommunicable darknessAgain I withdrew into my hot wet cornerAnd Night came again and with more intensityI shuddered with foreboding feeling the parent life ebband yearningly and undeniably 1 clutched fast to the life giving entrailsSo for a long timeMy mother could not tell what to doShe wanted mebut hated the thought of being tiedIt was a struggle between our separate desires for lifebut hers was a losing gamefor she only half wanted to winAnd the great cold gave place to great heat and that again to great cold and the intricate scarlet threads leapt madly through meIn anguish I could have said Let me go but again she would not and through endless periods of time held me fast adding clay to clay with a sure yet wavering thumbPrimeval darkness enwrapped me and the smells of steaming savannahsthe green pond and the tiger s muskI felt nails and teeth and to tear with themGradually I knew less of my motherMy prescience wavered and fledleaving only the memory that it had beenand like a sultry hermit I wrapped my cloaks more tightly about meadding cloak to cloak to shut out the irrelevant world of my mother and her thoughtsAt certain periods the cloaks would become transparent and again there would be remote prickly nebulaesticking fine needles through meQuickly I buried myself within my cloaks and again darkness and the urgent buzz of lifeworking obscurelyAnd quietly and more quietly life seized meI was aware of lightof density and of milkThen grey green electric darkness spluttered with blue sparks between pole and pole Four Horological Poems by Malcolm Cowley IIF I should go out of this room to walk down the inevitable streethe saysthe houses would reach out after me their long tentacular fingers groping over the sidewalk would clutch and drag me into respectability through these yawning doorwaysForty a week and a small but growing savings accounta cat and two babiescount them twoand yet time is gnawing at the self assurance of these houses time is wound like a worm devouring the entrails of these houses O the slow combustion of plasterO curled yellow wallpaper tickling the ceilings These houses will tumble like rotten fruit to the groundIIAnd observe if you please the action Of time upon the pedestrian worldIt runs lightly over the faces and scrawls its signature in twisted lines under the eyesit strips the flesh from the tendons and causes the tendons themselves to dissolve into their constituent carbon and nitrogen it leaves nothing but a structure of bones two hundred bones strutting down the street in a business suit The Little Review 19 two hundred female bones in crêpe georgette and the empty faces dyed with Pompeianthe rouge that beautifiesand yet these women wear time as lightly as a feather boa about the neckTime is a boa about the neck of all these people constricting slowly see they are choking their skin goes dead white under the rouge the bones rattle under the skin two hundred or rather two hundred and seven bones parade down the street wrapped in a feather BOAIIIThere is nothing at all that lives in this room by day and dust sifts down on the soiled coverlet dust filters among the lace curtains making queer amorphous bars across the avenue of escape into the sunsettread softly there are none but the dead remaining hereBut at night something wakens in the darkness the clock ticks viciously at every second throbbing its heart out against a tin breast the minutes stalk pompously across the field of consciousness an hour is a time unreckoned The Little Review precise and categorical the seconds hammer on the wallAt their touch the flesh disintegrates the mind is reduced to cerebrum and cerebellum dirty grey whorls like a ball of cotton waste like a bundle of soiled linenlike clothes cast off and shoddy the seconds drip from a great height splashing against the tips of my nerves against the shell of my insubstantial body and each erodes like geologic rain a bit of flesh a bit of petrified brainI shall countenance this no longersaid the Philosopher picking up the clock and hurling it out the doorand as he spoke he heard it rolling down the circular staircase punctuating his remarks very regularly as if it clung to rhythm as the sole expression of lifelifeI must have itLife said the Philosopher and returned to his accustomed place the room was grown so dark he could not see and the phosphorescence of his lace curtains dissolved leaving him out of time and space whirled in an eddy of eternity and yet his heart was hammering seventy beats to the minute time was throbbing against the fine skin of his temples time was dripping through his veinsIVThese skeletons which I discusssaid the philosopherrise at seven thirty the rain may fiddle down outsideor the sun turn the window shades into vulgar cloth of gold or the snow fall or any other of the usual phenomena of the seasonbut they rise at seven thirtyThe Little Review 21 O tin alarm clocks detonating simultaneously in hall bedrooms from the Battery to Yonkers from coast to coast and agencies in all the principal cities of the world O explosive clocks you are very evidently the symbol of something AND the quarrel over breakfast at eight fifteen The hurry of the trip to the subway while the hands of the clock of the tower of the building of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company of the greatest city of the greatest country God s country you know it race past like the Bronx expressAll morning they race over their correspondence Yours of the 9th received and in reply we beg to state that all afternoon boredom seeps out of the pigeonholes of their desks to pile up in the wastebaskets until they are seized by a tired jubilation at five o clock sharp O emotions you also have learned to punch the time clock But if at any time the alarm clocks failed simultaneously to function from coast to coast and in the agencies i 1 large foreign cities then perhaps people would forget the following emotional processes to wit the quarrel over breakfast the hurry the efficiency the boredom and the tired jubilation civilization would crumple like a silk hat that somebody sat on and forget to get up and we should be a frightfully long time straightening out the wrinkles Black Umbrellas by Ben Hecht LITTLE people hurry along in the dark streettheir heads tucked away under black umbrellas that float jerkily like expiring balloonsOver them are the great buildings and the rainThe day is darkened and the city is without facesA symmetrical stream of little black arcs stretches from distance to foreground as if emerging from a funnelThe little people drift with precision through the wash of the rainbundled together by the great buildings and the sacred puerilitiesThe tops of their umbrellas run like wavesclinging to each othereddying blindly at the crossings and careening on again with precisionAll day long the umbrellas have been moving their black and endless little current through the rain a monotone of precisionsan unvarying symbol of the unvaryingBeneath them the dresses of women stretch themselves into thin triangles and the trousers of men reach in unchanging diagonals for the pavementThe little people clothed themselves in the morning with much care and there was a stir in the bedrooms of the citya standing before mirrors and a determination to havesome daymore captivating pieces of cloth to hide themselves inNow the little triangles and diagonals make a swarm of patterns identical as the rain andlike the rainthe little people are pouring out of yesterday into tomorrowLife with its head hidden in an umbrella little people with bits of black cloth giving half outline to the impenetrable cells they exchange at death for wooden boxes the rain drums and chatters about them and the day like a dark mirror ignores themThe great buildingsmagnificent grandfathers of the little black arced umbrellasstand dutifully excluding the rainElectric lights already spray their circles of yellow mist upon the airThe stunted little sky of the city the corridor of trade and restaurant signs that almost brushes the tops of the black umbrellas is prematurely ablazeA checker board The Little Review 23 flight of windows gleams out of the spatula topped skyscrapersThe eyes of people wandering beyond the dripping webs of umbrellas catch sudden glimpses through the yellow spaces of the checkerboard of little puppet worlds inhabited by parts of furniture and unexpected facesThus the city looks and moves under an umbrella in the streetI move with itan old dream like a fawning beggar at my elbowIt is the dream of the urge of lifeIt follows me with the eyes of dead yearsI have already given to this dream too many almsYet it fawns for moreSorrowful dream of the urge of lifeinsatiable mendicant at my elbowits lips cajole but its eyesdeep and empty as a skull sstare with many deathsWe walk on and the rain carries a whiimpering into my heart the whimpering of an old dream asking almsI invent names for the half hidden faces and give meanings to themAdjectives are an antidote for the companion at my elbow and perhaps some daywearied of listening to themhe will abandon meThere is a kinship among the black umbrellas bumbing and scraping at each otherI observe thisAnd yet beneath them there are only solitudesThe trousers of men and skirts of women move in solitudes precise little solitudes as identical as the black umbrellas and the rainWalking before me under an umbrella is a young womanHer face hidden from the rain is that of a rouged nunas are the faces of the young women of the city who mask their vacuity with rosesShe has been hurrying but now she moves more slowlyI invent a name for her and a meaningShe is unaware of this for it is the common fancy of little people swarming in streets that their solitudes are impenetrableWithin them they movebrazenly giving themselves to the outrageous underworlds of thoughtSo the young woman walks before me in the streetlocked in her little depthssurrounded by the secret names and images of her yesterdays and tomorrowsI walkfollowing at her elbow as an old dream like a fawning beggar follows at mineFor it has occurred to me that the young woman is peering out of her solitudeShe has become aware of the halloo of the rain as if it had just started24 The Little Review It is obvious that she has been movingaimlessly preoccupiedthrough the downpourher words following lazily upon the pretty tracks of memoryAnd then the words suddenly jumbled and the pretty tracks became a circle in a voidIt is this that makes hurrying little people abruptly slow their step and look up from the groundas if to recover somethingThe young womandeserted by her solitudelooked quickly about her and perceived only the solitudes of others which though identical are always meaninglessI observe and understandShe has for the moment escaped from a cella pleasing enough cell of remembered and expected destinationsto find herself free in a world of cellsUmbrellas run by herLegs and arms thrust themselves senselessly about herIt is a matter of little enough importance a young woman staring bewildered by the rainYet I remain at her elbowThere is in her bewilderment opportunity for the employment of adjectivesSomething has amazed herIn her unoccupied brain the little world darting about under her eyes reflects itself as an unoccupied worldan unoccupied world stripped of destinationsIn the umbrellas alone there seems a startling kinship and an even more startling superiority of purposeThey perhaps have meaningsbut the little people under them have noneTheir destinations have deserted them and they are moving with an incongruous hurryhaving neither beginnings nor endingsFor moments the young woman staresI do not know her thought but I know that a lonesomeness has fastened upon herthat having lost her solitude she has lost the oblivious kinship of people in crowdsThe intricate little furniture of lifeher minutae of preoccupation have vanished from her as if a light that was shining on them had been shut offSo for this instant during which I have been observing her she is free of the world and there is in her the terrible premonition for the world beats remorselessly on without herThe black umbrellas float jerkily like expiring balloonsThe long V shaped stretch of people crawls with continuous patience out of distance into distance Nowhere nowhere chatters the rain and in the mouth of the young woman life lies suddenly tastelessAn old dream like a fawning beggar is at her elbowthe dream of the urge of life that but a The Little Review 25 moment ago was the reality of realitiesWe walk on and the young woman surrounded by an unaccountable emptiness listens with foreign ears to the rain and with scrutinizing eyes regards the fantastic rim of her umbrellaThe contours and noises of life seem not like the contours and noises of life but like haphazard lines and sounds without contentI employ my adjectives and shelost in a curious despairfeels the painthe nostalgia for the unknown slowly distend her breasts and sink thin edged into the depths of her bodyAs she tries to think little fears burst excitedly in warm clouds in her throat keen mists lacerate and darken the little channels of her sensesThen words form themselves and she is saying I want somethingSomething The rain drums and chatters about usThe tides of umbrellas careen with precision along the base of the great buildings and the lights of the citylike bits of vivid pasteboarddrift over us in the downpourThe echo of the cry that rises from all endings burns in my heartCry of the deadpassionless fever of the emptied senses reaching for life beyond contoursI listen to the echo of its murmur in a city street and stare into a tangle of trousers and skirtsLife is a crafty beggar masking its dead eyes with new darknessesDespair with thin fingers caresses the heart of the young woman and her senses sweep furtively the horizon of her little world and she searches in vain for the face of her longing Nowherenowhere chatters the rainThe great buildings and the little black umbrellas say a nowhere and the long crowd in the street the long crowd in the street runs awayI know the thought of the young womanIt has hurried hopefully to the man from whose arms she has comeShe images again the deliciousthrilling hour of his talk and caressesBut as she thinks of them quicklyfrightenedlythey become a part of the puppet worlds that lie within lights shining out of building windowsWe walk on and the young woman stares into the dark mirror of the rain whose odours and lines give fugitive form to the mystery of spaceUnder her umbrella the rouge of her cheeks like a mask slips away and her face is whiteThere is a whiteness in her heartthe 26 The Little Review gathering fear of one who waits for unexpected thingsThe echo of the words of longing swims sickeningly in her bodyFrom the underworld of her thought demoniac impulses raise a dizzying babbleInanimate they burst into wild flight and yet leave her motionlessThe words of her longing have gone into her fingers and I watched her closed hand shiver into her legs that plunge with violence beneath her skirtShe feels them almost coming to life in her breastsSo she is walking swiftly againflying from an emptinessWe walk on until the block is ended and the young woman pauses to smile expectantly into a shop windowShe breathes deeply and moves her umbrella aside so that the rain may wet her faceI know of what she is thinkingThere is a curious sense of guilt the confused shame of little people who turn their backs for a moment upon life as upon a beggarand for a moment give words to the cry that rises from all endingsThe young woman penitent and again alive whispers to herself it was the man from whose arms she has comeFor there was no other somethingIs not love one of the finalitiesSo her thoughts are again with himAgain he talks and caresses and there comes to her the glowthe keen yearning for satiety for some completion that she calls by the name of loveThere was nothing else she wantedThe rain made her dizzyAnd yet the memory of the terror and elation that for an instant beneath the black umbrellas created a vacuum of her solitude clings to her like the ghost of a mysterious infidelityAway from the shop and it too is goneThe little black arced umbrellas swarm about us as if trying to fly over each otherUnder them are the faces of people safely and intelligently locked in little solitudesThe rain drums and chatters about themdropping walls from their umbrellas and burying them deeper in their secret destinationsTo the young woman the thing in the street is again explicableIt requires neither words nor thoughtIt is rain and peoplebuildings and umbrellaslights and a shining pavementand out of it rises the swift urge of lifeWe walk on and her hand touches mineHer fingers close prettily over itWe talk and her words are eagerShe has been thinking of The Little Review 27 me she says and her eyes lie avidlyShe struggles against a confidencewondering what there is to tellIt blurts forth then adroitly in a laugha laugh that belongs to the orchestra of sweet soundsI am so happyshe saysI am so happyThe joy of return has made her buoyantreturn into her solitude with its familiar little furniture among which I stand a decoration of the momentShe has forgotten the beggar who fawned in the rain at her elbow and things are explicablethings are clearand have names and swing vividly through the dark dayWe walk onhands

lifeAie proud malignant corse STUDYBY CHARLES ELLISTHE LITTLE REVIEW EditorMargaret Anderson Foreign EditorsJohn Rodker Jules Romains Advisory Board DiscussionThe Public Tasteby Mary Widney I HAVE been puzzled by that explanatorymaking no compromise with the public tastewhich appears relentlessly upon the Little Review coversIt seems singularly obtuse for so perspicacious a magazineThe whole spirit of the work between its covers belies the obvious interpretationthat you are capitalizing your agnosticismnot too delicately angling for the dilettante iconoclastIf you are sincerely regardless of the public taste why be so blatant about itA true contempt is impersonal a true disregard cannot be cognizant of the thing disregardedThe small boy whistling in the grave The Little Review 33 yard and the Little Review slapping the face of public tasteSomeway it lacks dignityandwhat is more seriouscasts aspersions on the worthiness of the movement it espousesI may be misunderstanding grosslybut as I have saidI am puzzledWon t youI should like to write you a long heart felt letter about that sloganIt has been one of my compromises for the past three yearsIt came to usamong many other precious thingsfrom Ezra PoundTaste in Art is a thing that could never get my attention and soanything as casual as that taste made by the newspaperslectures bureausthe fashion art magazinesand MrMencken could never lead me to endorse the sloganIt does helpas colourto balance the heavy letters at the topand it does undoubtedly save many people their quartersI believe in peace and silence for and from themassesa happy undisturbed peopleI don t know how this can be brought about entirelyI try not to go very far into what the suffragists must be feeling when they contemplate what public taste has

ParisLa BombeLa zut excellsiorNote from an article by May Sinclair in theEnglish ReviewIF the Little Review had never printed anything but what came to it through its foreign editor it might by this time have ranked as an important international concern unfortunately it printed many things for which MrPound was not responsibleand when it trespassed its iniquities were laid on himBesides he gave opportunitiesHis critical manner was deceptiveWhen the Little Review announced The Little Review 37 its Henry James numberwith an article by Ezra Poundsome of us had visions of an irresponsible and agile animal shinning up a monument to hang by his feet from the top What actually happenedI do not know any book yet written on Henry James of more solid value than MrPound sBrief Notein the Little ReviewMy experience and spiritualistic beliefs in international magazines of art and letters make me long for May Sinclair s advice both as an efficiency expert and as a fortune tellerAside fromUlyssesall of the work sent to us by Pound could have gone into eight or ten numbers of the Little ReviewIf this could have captured the international art consciousness we are overcome with grief that we interferedand frustrated what wasn t exactly our aim to become aninternational concern I do hold with Miss Sinclair that if any one could have made us an international concern it could only have been some one as American as Pound with his same interest in and appreciation of foreign workWe are here to trespass we will stand by our own iniquitiesWe have not trespassed in thinking that all

sacrament back into the tabernacle and the choir sang Laudate Dominum omnes gentes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and Edy asked was she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out OlookCissyAnd they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the churchblue and then green and purple It s fireworksCissy Caffrey saidAnd they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the churchhelterskelterEdy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn t fall running Come onGertyCissy calledIt s the bazaar fireworksBut Gerty was adamantShe had no intention of being at their beck and callIf they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she wasThe eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tinglingShe looked at him a momentmeeting his glanceand a light broke in upon herWhitehot passion was in that facepassion silent as the graveand it had made her hisAt last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarksand she knew he could be trusted to the deathsteadfasta man of honour to his fingertipsShe leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like thatsupply soft and delicately roundedand she seemed to hear the panting of his heart his hoarse breathingbecause she knew about the The Little Review 43 passion of men like thathotbloodedbecause Bertha Supple told her once in secret about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the record office that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bedBut this was different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lipsBesides there was absolution so long as you didn t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be woman priests that would understand without telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she toomy dearand besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it didAnd Jacky Caffrey shouted to lookthere was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and shouted to looklook there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying about through the aira soft thing to and frodarkAnd she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees upupand they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after ithighhighalmost out of sightand her face was suffused with a divinean entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things toonainsook knickersfour and elevenon account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and the it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he could see high up above her knee where no one ever and she wasn t ashamed and he wasn t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn t resist the sight like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on lookinglookingShe would fain have cried to him chokinglyheld out her snowy slender arms to him to cometo feel his lips laid on her white browAnd then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and Othen the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O and everyone cried O O and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and 44 The Little Review ah they were all greeny dewy stars falling with goldenO so lovely O so softsweetsoftThen all melted away dewily in the grey airall was silentAhShe glanced at him as she bent forward quicklya

in the valley of the Mississippi River have the eyes of an owlI have risen from the place where I slept under a tree but cannot shake the sleep out of my eyesThe nights in the valley of the Mississippi River are staring nightsThey look at men with the pupils extendedThe skies are empty over the cities and the plainsThe skies have not formulated a thought that I can breathe into my beingIn the whole valley of the Mississippi River there is no bed of thought in which I can lieThere are farm women living in houses that stand beside dusty roads in Illinois and IowaIn Indiana and Ohio there are many townsIn Michigan far up where the valley is no more and where the cold finger of the north touches the earth in September there are men living who wear heavy boots and fur caps and who walk all day under naked treesEverywhere are men and women who arouse wonder in meI The Little Review 59 have awakened the feeling of wonder in myselfI have awakened from sleeping under a treeMy walking far outat the edge of lifeis an adventure upon which I resolved only after I had kissed with my warm lips the cold fingers of deathI am walking in greater and greater circlesSometimes I am afraidI run crazily in wider and wider circles when I am afraidXIIThere was a woman sitting at a desk in an office in Chicago whom I went to visitI told her my feet were cold because I had spent my life walking in the bed of a riverI leaned over the desk and peered into her eyesAs I remember her she was a small woman with yellow hairAs I leaned forward something happenedMy lips touched her lipsMy cheeks touched her cheeksHer eyes opened and closed like the eyes of a cat in a darkened roomHer eyes were like little pools into which I threw myselfLike a beaver of the north I had built myself a home in the pools My lips have made many strange wordsI have been walking since birth in the bed of a river I said to the womanI must return to the seeking of truthThe woman and I had for a long time walked hand in handOne evening I remember we got into a wagon at the edge of a town and rode slowly along through the dust of a roadway under a moonIt was in a land where elderberry bushes grew by the fencesWe stopped by a gate and went into a pastureCattle stood nearby under a treeThe air was filled with a warm milky smellThat must have been in Septemberin the month when the fingers of the north play over the fieldsWe went into the field and sat on wet grassI remember that I spoke of John the BaptistI told her how John sat on a hill all alone for a night and a day before he went away into a forestIt was quiet in the field when I went there with the woman We are brothers and sisters I said let us make love My arms grew very hot and the white arms of the woman grew hotHer handcaressing the grasstouched the back of an insect60 The Little Review The insect sang madlyThe insect went into an ecstasyThe woman and I came out of the field and departed into a cityriding in a wagon that had no springsI remember that we rode under a moon1 remember that we rode slowly along under a moon beside cornfieldsWe came into the streets of a cityWe came into sleeping streetsThe people in the houses in the city were asleepWe rode in a slow going wagon in dark streets under the staring windows of housesLater I went to the woman dressed as you see me nowI went into a building and up a stairway into a roomI leaned over the woman s desk as she sat writing words on a sheet of paperI said the words I have put down here in regard to the matter of wading in riversIt is my own belief the whole plan was matured in advanceIt is my own belief I took hold of insanity asin a crowded city streetone takes hold of the hand of a childThe incidenthowevermay have had more significance than thatInsanity is a slow moving liquid poured into a cupAs you look into the cup your eyes change their colourThe liquid is greenIt is an ultimate blueThe liquid is colorlessIt moves out of the West into the EastMy notionI fancywas to ask the woman a questionI wanted to ask if she would drink with me out of the cupI had no desire to take the woman awayI did not want to lift the woman out of her lifeI am uncertain of my desiresYou have already sensed thatWomen in farm houses by dusty roads I have traveledthe men of The Little Review 61 the north who walk in winter in heavy cloth boots under naked treesall the men and women with whom I have walked and among whom I have gone talking of life have been confusing to meI have conceived of life as a bowl into which I am castIf the outer world is inhabited by godsas I choose to believe it isit is because I am minute and you are minuteI cannot keep my footing on the side of the bowl of lifeThere is however no humbleness in meI constantly strive to reach outIt is that makes me seem strange in your sightIf you have heard my voicelaughing at the bottom of the bowlit is because I have an ambition to be a flea in God s earI have wished to set up a roaring in God s headI have wished to roar of menwomen and children I have seen walking in the valley of a riverI have wished to remind God of my love of my fellowsThat last statement I fear is a lieI am not concerned with the fate of my fellowsIf you think I am you are mistaken about meI am not one who breeds in the beds at nightI am one who walks up and downBreeding does not concern meI have no motive in climbing on the side of the bowlI wonder if my motive in whispering strange words to a woman can be explainedI am sure you will see what I am driving atI am wondering if my motive in asking her to drink with me out of the cup of insanity had back of it a wholesome desireI have an impulse to be wholesomeDid I want to lift her over the side of the bowlDid I want to put my feet on her slender shoulders and leap into the arms of a GodDid I desire only to get into a quiet darknessDid I wish to create a thoughtAm I after all one of the breedersone of those who lie in the bedsAm I crawling on the side of the bowl with some definite desire asleep in my being to be continued The Reader Critic by FESwanseeWalesI wonder if you are interested in impressions
