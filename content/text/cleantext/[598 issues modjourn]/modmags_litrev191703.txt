Certain Critic Amy Lowell WellJohn KeatsI know how you felt when you swung out of the inn And started up Box Hill after the moonLordHow she twinkled in and out of the box bushes Where they arched over the pathHow she peeked at you and tempted youAnd how you longed for thenaked waistof her You had put into your second cantoYou felt her silver running all over youAnd the shine of her flashed in your eyesSo that you stumbled over roots and thingsAhHow beautifulHow beautifulLying out on the open hill With her white radiance touching you LightlyFlecking over you My Lady of the MoonI flow out to your whitenessCopyright1917by Margaret CAnderson 2 The Little Review BrightnessMy hands cup themselves About your disk of pearl and fireLie upon my faceBurn me with the cold of your hot white

a girdle for you of wordsLike a shawl my words will cover youSo that men may read of you and not be burnt as I have been Sere my heart until it is a crinkled leafI have held you in it for a momentAnd

Immortal GoddessDearly BelovedDon t leave meMy hands clutch at moon beamsAnd catch each otherMy DearMy DearMy beautiful far shining ladyOhGodI am tortured with this anguish of unbearable beauty The Little Review 3 Then you stumbled down the hillJohn KeatsPerhaps you fell once or twiceIt is a rough pathAnd you weren t thinking of thatThen you wrote By a wavering candleAnd the moon frosted your window till it looked like a sheet of blue iceAnd as you tumbled into bedyou said It s a piece of luck I thought of coming out to Box Hill Now comes a sprig little gentlemanAnd turns over your manuscript with his mincing fingersAnd tabulates places and datesHe says your moon was a copy book maximAnd talks about the spirit of solitudeAnd the salvation of genius through the social orderI wish you were here to damn him With a goodroundagreeable oathJohn KeatsBut just snap your fingersYou and the moon will still love When he and his papers have slithered away In the bodies of innumerable worms4 The Little Review The Little Review Mary Garden jhWHAT did the critics mean when they used to say that never again in our generation would there come another BernhardtThey didn t mean that there would be no other great actresses because they were writing of actressesall the timewhom they considered greatIn an argument they would talk largely of Bernhardt s personalityLet them call it personality if they are using the better Oriental meaning of the wordIndividualityBut I fear they mean only to limit something unknown so that it may be understoodThe more external nullities they bring to prove it personality the more its unknown nature is emphasizedThe more talk there is of arresting qualities of personactsand dressof frankness and ferocitytears and terror the more talk there is of all its eccentric sanitiesthe more it recedes and becomes definitely itselfaloof and unnamedArthur Symons tried to express it when he wrote of Bernhardt Two magics met and unitedin the artist and in the woman But after all it is only that through the woman you feel the imminence of something as great and impersonal as the sweep Of sea and the growth of flowersIn all the artswhenever the magic of the artist has been united with this other magic the possessor has been of the first greatMichael Angelo and the dark troubled magic of himI wonder whyeven in those people to whom has come some appreciation of the magic of the artistthere is still so often such strong resentment and distrust of this other magicBecause of their adventures in the great emotionsthose who have it loosen new forces of lifethey recreate the great passionsthey add something to FateEveryone feels that he has a right to a share in that which the millions are working together in uproar to add to existenceMany long for a share in that which the artists are making in silence for the soulBut who is there except the artist who is willing to feel in this thing the imminence of something beyond life and personalityWho else in the world except the lonely insanebecause of their adventures in illusions and hallucinationsever add anything to Fate How easy to say that genius is akin to madnessAll great anthithises are akinall unknown things are mysteriously akinas all known things are naturally akinBut how poignantly akin are the 6 The Little Review known and unknownWhy does anyone exclude himself from any connection with the infiniteWhen I was a little child I lived in a great asylum for the insaneIt was a world outside of the worldwhere realities had to be imagined and whereeven through those excursions in illusions and hallucinationsthere ran a strange lonelinessThe world can never be as lonely in those places where the mind has never come as in a place where the mind has goneThere were no books to read in this place except the great volumes in the PatientsLibraryand I had read them allThere was no one to ask about anythingThere was no way to make a connection withlife Out there in the world they were working and thinkinghere we were stillVery early I had given up every one except the InsaneThe others knew nothing about anythingor knew only uninteresting factsFrom the Insane I could get everythingThey knew everything about nothingand were my authority but beyond that there was a silenceWho had made the picturesthe books and the music in the world And how had they made them And how could you tell the makers from just peopleDid they have a light around their headsWere there any of them in the world nowAnd would I ever see oneOne day a name came to me suddenlySome one was talking of awicked French actresswho was touring AmericaSarah Bernhardt Even when they said it the name had a light around itShe would come as far as StLouisI would go at onceBut I was too littleI had no money I would run awayI would walk the whole distance to herBut she would be gone before I could get thereSome day I would go to ParisOther people had got that farI would go on living for thatAnd then she came againI was therethe first nightsitting in the balcony with some other art studentsWe had sold our futures to sit so closeI was burning with hot excitement and shaking with cold fear until the moment it was Camille when the long french doors opened and she came languidly and as if from a great distancehands extended as if balancing her exquisitely upon an enchanted atmosphereher suave voluptuous tawny head bent slightly downI threw myself mind and soul into the waves of that carressing fiery magic which swept out to usAfter this came a new agonythe critics had said there would never be anotherThere was Dusewhom I have never seenbut she has always filled me with a restless troubleWhat artist has ever so dared to offend ArtNever in all her life as an actress did she choose a play in which her great art could come into its ownIt always seems that there is more The Little Review 7 laid upon the artist than a willingness to serveit is almost a command to serveDid Duse deny the command and by so doing add the martyrdom of Art to a great personal tragedyOr was it because she tried to create an art out of nature itself that Art revenged itself upon her through natureAs an actress she hadno resources outside simple human nature As a woman she had no resource in ArtThen a new name came across the worldwith a new radianceNot with the glow of Duse s halonor with the threat of Bernhardt s heat lightningbut with the radiance of the Northern Lights it shone above the horizonMary GardenHer magics have this kind of splendorShe has brought a new temper into the drama something not Latinnot EnglishDuse could never be unnaturalBernhardt can never be unsophisticatedun FrenchEnglish actresses can seldom be unconventionalBut Mary Garden She brings a sharp new ecstasy of lifean inexorable sadness of loveshe brings an energy that is grace and a calm that is energyshe brings a frankness that is mysteryThere is something Norsk about Mary GardenIn her the pure metal of the mind seems to have been annealed by an Oriental fireadding to it a passion without vehemenceThere is something unconquered about heras if she came from that land where the sun shines at midnightfrom that race which never made for itself a beneficent GodI don t know where to begin to write about Mary Garden s artThere is art within art within artand then there is Mary GardenFirst of allshe seems to be the only singer who knows that all the arts come from the same source and follow the same lawsCritics love to say that pure song and pure music do not express human emotionalthough dramapoetrypainting and sculpture doWhat logicPure music and pure song express exactly what dramapoetrypainting and sculpture expressBut none of them expresses human emotionthey express the source of human emotionTo express the emotions of life is to liveto express the life of emotions is to make artI wish I could tell beautifully what a great creative artist Mary Garden isIt is one thing for the artist to create a character within the outlines definitely or indefinitely drawn by the composerto put himself in the place of the character and act as he would actBut the creative artist takes the character to himself and then creates from his imagination in his own image the image of his soulThe more universal the artistthe greater his power to reveal his soul in different imagesWhat an infinite thing 8 The Little Review Mary Garden has shown her soul to beThaisthe JongleurMonna VannaCarmenGriselidisToscaMelisandeSalomeAnd so when she creates a character she recreates the operaMary Garden is the only singer in opera to whom song is speechBecause in opera song and music have been fused with dramathe voice must become a medium for creating characterthought and emotiontogether with the handsface and body of the actor singerThere is no need to discuss here what has or what has not been accomplished toward the creation of a new art by this fusion of the artsYou have but to hear and see Mary Garden in Pelleas and Melisande to find poetrymusicsinging and acting united so that the essence of each art comes to us with a rarer flavor than when freeNo perfect thing can lose by being united with another perfect thingHoweverit is no small task to do this in those older compositions in which music has been written to melodramato be sung by elaborate musical instrumentsWhen the music carries beyond the true emotion of the dramaor when it does not reach to the limits of the dramait is only an artist with flawless intelligence who can break over the barrier of the score and hold the music to the emotion with a backward line of the voice or carry it on by sheer genius to its full taskAnd what a voiceYou can t quite stand it when Mary Garden sings words likeamourpitiééternel It breaks your heart in a strange waybecause she makes you feel more precisely our brief longingour frail tenderness and our deceiving hopeMany people don t like it the same ones who don t like modern paintingthe ImagistsScriabine and the restThey have no idea that it is a new kind of instrumentto which they must bring new earsThey sayWhy does she sing at allWhy doesn t she go into straight dramanever realizing for a moment that she has a longer reach than Bernhardta stronger grasp than DuseThere is not enough resistance for her in pure dramaShe must paint the canvas fullOnce before I called Mary Garden a great decorative actressI am using decoration in the sense in which it is used in paintingwhere elimination and not elaboration is used to emphasize the intention of line and colorShe carries this same idea into her costumesshe can give you the whole spirit and atmosphere of an historical costume by a mere silhouette of its linesAnd she can draw in the whole psychology of a scene with one line of her body the line of her walkIf she is to dominate a situation with her intellect or her beauty she walks from the center of her intelligencewhich is the headgiving a length of line that makes the slightest step a strideif it is a matter of the soul she walks from the center of her The Little Review 9 presencewhich is the top plane of the chestmoving like a Presence not like a beingwhen it is love she walks straight from her heartwith a line that repeats a painwhen it is passion she sinks the line to a point lower than the hipand prowls destructivelyIn Thaiswhen she is trying to enthrall the monkshe winds about the stage and himbending slightly in hip and kneeLaterin a scene of contest with himshe lifts the line to her consciousness and stands to the height of her belief in her own beauty and powerWhen she goes over to the nunsshe moves away with that beautiful unconsciousness of action which is never so mysteriously perfect a thing as in MelisandeThere is nothing so thrilling in life to me as to watch this living painting which moves in rhythm like a friezeHow I should love to see her working out her designs against a background that has carried out the line of intention of a poemImagine Mary Garden in the Tristan Liebestodcoming in upon a scene in which the short lines of a truncated castle rise from the endless planes of a black and purple seaa fleet of violins in the orchestra singing the Love Death and Mary challenging all this dark negation with the one wordTristan in a voice which is a singing painBut most of all I wish some one would make operas for her of those exotic things that lie outside of common experiencebut which have their place in lifenature too heavily laden or too fantastically free or too weirdly truebright precious hidden thingscorroded jewelsheavy hanging flowers of sleepmoon flowers of the dayHow passionately and reverently she performed that ritual of dark heat and sex savagery which is SalomeThe electric abundance of life in Mary Garden and the splendor of her body are dazzling at firstBut it is a stillness of soulan exaltation of passion which really stamp herThere is something inviolate about herOther actresses may be soulfulgraveor innocentbut Mary Garden has authentic purity But what talk of all these things I only want to say AhConchobarhave you ever seen herwith her high laughing turbulent head thrown backward this Aphrodite of the Norththis bacchante from the seathis viking of the soulThere is no other who has all beautyShe is the white sincerest pledge of deityThe Little Review Prose Poems Richard Aldington Thanatos Myrrhinewe have often sung of the sharp end of lifeoften mocked at death in the midst of the fierce esctasy of our embracesWe have heard of this savage and mysterious god from the stately words of Homerand we also have mourned for beautiful BionWe have seen death graven in bronze as a drowsy youth scattering poppies from his delicate handsAnd all this seemed very quiet and lovely a tender farewell to the sweet lips of lifeBut when I saw for the first time the pallid shrunken face of a dead girland that girl our lover Kleone my veins shrank with terror and I feared through all my trembling limbsLet others sing gaily or yearningly of death and deck this sombre lord with garlandswe are too timidtoo frail in hope for thatOthers may dream of the gold islands of the happy dead or of the calm spirits among the phantom flowers in the meadows beyond AcheronWe can only turn asideholding heart to trembling heartand number the dividing moments with close kissescounting all time lost that is not golden with love Drinkmy beloveddrink from this wide silver cupdrink as the Maenads in the pine crowned orgy of IacchusDrinkdrinkAnd as our bodies meet tear the garland from my brow and the thin veil from my breasts Those who are about to die fear only chastity and an empty wine cup Hermes of the Dead Myrrhinewhen I was a girl in white AlexandriaI listened to the talk of poetsand of philosophers who came to my house to buyas they said delicious remorse for five mines From themhad I been another AspasiaI might have learned wisdombut from poets I learned only to love and to know beautyand from the philosophers I learned nothing except thatDeath is not to be feared And this I learned no better than theyfor we are all cowards at the endBut since I must go from yousince already the winged sandals of Kyllenian Hermes are rustling the Olympian air for mesince in your purse now lies the silver obol I must drop in the grim ferry man s handlisten a little to meWhen I am but a cupful of grey dust in a tallnarrow throated stone vasewhen the mouth that sang you and the lips that kissed you are withered and silentwhen the hands that touched you have crumbled in the funeral flameswhen the eyes that lighted at your beauty are quenchedwhen the ears that loved your beautiful voice are vanishedwhen the frail spirit that leaped and mingled with your spiritlike two flamesis a tenuous phantom which scarcelyis when life has left methen you must livelive for yourselfbut for me alsoFor my sake Eos in a cloudless sky gliding from the many isled sea must be more tender and more thrillingfor my sake the scent of ripe apples in the dim gold autumn must be keener and more odorousfor my sake the music of Pindar and Theocritus must be more statelymore flower likemore melancholy sweetfor my sake the ecstasy of love must be sharperwilderfor my sake you must be more beautifulmore alertmore delicateI shall be loveless in a scentless landwhere there is no change of lightI shall be desolate and alone and the memory of the dear words of poets will fade from meBut if you love and live fully and serve beauty for my sakethen some slight glow will lighten the dead sky and there will be some faint perfume for me in the chill blossoms of asphodel Now loose my handfor Hermes of the Dead clasps the otherThe Little Review Harold Bauer s Music Margaret CAndersonThe most interesting art in the modern worldto meis Harold Bauer s playing of the pianoAnd one of the strangest phenomenon in the modern world is the fact that people go to hear him and talk about what he does in terms of what other pianists doNow there is no connection between Bauer s playing and that of any other pianist who has so far come to lightThe whole root and fibre of it is differentAs I have tried to say beforehe has more concern with sound than any other pianistHe loves the piano moreHe believes quite different things about its potentialitiesBut you needn t know what he believes to know that he is doing something differentYou can hear thatsurelyBut still they babblehe does this as well as Hofmannand this less well than Paderewskiand this better than so and soWhy do they keep on talking of what he does or doesn t doas though it were a matter of techniquethis colossal art of conceptionHow I love to think of all the famous pianists who have gone to the piano to reveal themselvesand then of Harold Bauer who has brought the piano to himselfto reveal itIt s something like the difference between the artist and the average manwhen any one talks to you of how the struggles and agonies of the artist mould his art you can show him that it s just the other way aroundthe artist in him is what moulds his struggles and his agoniesAnd it s something of this kind that must be said about Bauer s difference of approachAs for the things he doesmost of them are the things that any good musician doeshe makes his conception run just ahead of his executionlike a switchman who regulates trains from a high towerhe makes tone contrasts that what do the critics usually sayOf course he does many things better than most good musicianshe throws out handsful of color that most of them would give their souls to achievehe makes the piano sing more deeply than any one else has donehe strikes chords that no piano except his Mason and Hamlin has ever given forthhe never hurts the soundsand he never applies music to the instrument instead of drawing music out of itas even the best pianists have a way of doingThere is The Little Review 13 less diffusion of sound in his performancesyou have a feeling that it is the most closely thought music you have ever heardHe edits the composition until it is flawlessly adjusted to the piano s best valuesAll these are essentials of his playingbut they are not thedifferenceof which I wish to writeHarold Bauer uses the piano as if it were an instrument endowed with an intrinsicsignificant form I once heard Fritz Kreisler play some accompanimentsand I shall never forget how he showed his feeling that the piano has a mysterious life of its own with which he did not mean to interfereIt was as though he simply touched the springs which set that life in motionNot being a creator on the piano he did not try to do more than thatBauer believes the same thingbut on top of that theory he builds up the edifice of his ownsignificant form With most pianists you have a feeling that what they want to say is interspersed with what the piano is saying on its own accountand the result is a muddleWhat Bauer has to say is placed carefully on top of that life growing just beneathand the result is the most consciously intelligent art I have ever come in contact withThis is making the piano not what paint is to the painterbut what color is to himThere s a great differenceEven Hofmann can use the keys as if they were paint colors to be mixed into colorbut to touch them as if they were color something already complete and living is to do a significant thingAnd so in the case of Bauer you are made to realize that the piano is the thingeven more than the music that is to be played on it far more than the stunts that can be done with itI believe he says something to this effectthat the piano is the only instrument for which no technique is demandedandHowif I were to practice all daycould I possibly play at night I know that he has no use for the agonizing drill of even the greatest teachers of the pianoYou can imagine him askingIs there any longer any meaning in thatDoes the sound of it interest you You can get any effect you wanton the pianoif you can think clearly what effect you wantYou needn t practise six months to achieve a chord in which the middle note sings lounder than the other twostrike it the fraction of a second before the other two and the sound will be what you are listening forIn January I heard his Modern Program in Chicagoand it was the most beautiful performance on the piano I ever dreamed of hearingThe other day in Aeolian Hall he and Casals gave a joint recitalin which 14 The Little Review Bauer played the Schumann Papillons as his soloIn almost every measure of it you could hear effects attained by the kind of thinking I have described marvelous values that can be offered only by one who can conceive greatlyBut I heard musicians in the audience saying that they couldn t discover any new thing in this musicCasals is very close to the soul of musicof coursebut sometimes his mastery of the instrument is unrelated to its best beautyHis playing seems not to be built solidly on the beauty of soundwhile with Bauer the emphasis is always on soundwhich means merely thisthat an interesting and compact phrasing made out of thin or harsh sound is as worthless as beautiful tunes played on a worn out piano How I love these concerts of his in which you need never think of the magic of finger tipsthe hand the perfect instrument etc etc because of long patient years of diabolical muscular exerciseOnce I believe I said that Harold Bauer was not a geniusIt must have been in that period when I thought that the genius carries around with him always the look of being submerged in great emotionsI know now that he is probably the genius of our world the man who has made something entirely of his ownand something that will live not only as a tradition of great piano playing but as a great invention of new soundThe Little Review AndjhThe WarMadmenHonorSpeculations in miseryforced

volume of Pelle the Conquerer if you did not go any deeper than the storyIt is so silentAll the people seem to be gone all the people who passed through the other books like a dark secret processioneach carrying his story in his handsYou miss the sounds of the manymany footsteps the heavy footsteps of the workersthe fagged footsteps of the womenthe searching footsteps of the childrenand the wandering footsteps of the godforsakenwhich made a dull pattern of sound behind the story of PelleIn this book the strong confident footfall of Pelle strikes out clear against the faint fall of those who walk beside him or those who walk far offIt is only when you have finished the book that the design of the whole story becomes clear and perfectthe design back of the life of man16 The Little Review In his childhood he walked with animalsin his youth he gathered to himself knowledge and those after his own heartin his manhood he became a leader of multitudesand thenforsaken by allin solitude he found his own soulFor those who wish to read it that way Jelle the Conquerer may be a labor novelBut it seems to me that through all the story Nexo has gone the stronge way of the artist and not the strict way of the reformerHere in the last volume he leaves the labor questionleaves the question as to whether Pelle s cooperative workshop is the solution or whether his working men s homes are a success as part of something that will work out its own fate or be worked out by the Pelles of the worldIt is not something he has been teaching or solvingIt is something he has been creatingOut of the drama of material poverty he has created the more profound tragedy of the poor in heartAnd as if he could never forget them he turns to them againWith a few reluctant stories of prison life told by Pelle he makes the prison loom against our lives likethat dark mill over hellgrinding misery into crime And thenso that you may never forgethe chooses not with that mere truth which is life but with that absolute truth which is Art the child of the lovely dreaming Hannewhom life so ironically sacrificedto be again a sacrificeThe story of the death of this petulant child of little airs and sudden angersof her pathetic and furious wrestle with the ghastly memories of her lifebites into your heart and you are maddened by the brutality of the life that takes away everything before it has given anythingI should like to tell all over again why I think this book is the novelgreater than Jean ChristopheJacob Stahlor any of themA BlowIMAGINE what it did to us to have Harriet Monroe say in Poetry that there is too much art in Amy Lowell s MenWomen and GhostsToo much artAnd she is an editor and we know what kind of poems she has to readI can imagine a book having all sorts of too muchbut art means not too much or too little of anythingHow does Miss Monroe expect Amy Lowell to writeif not like Amy LowellShe has not come the way of Masters or of DreiserShe is really the first poet in America to express in her writing something of that leisure from which they tell us Art flowers bestMenWomen and Ghosts is a beautiful bookfull of stately measuresThe Little Review 17 James JoyceTHERE isn t time for me to write about James Joyce s The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in this issueIt came too late from the publisherSo far as I have seen the whole comment of the reviewers has been on the background for the portrait the socialpoliticaland religious life of Ireland today etcBut there is the portrait itself bearing a slight

shiningSurely it isn t obligationHarold Bauer s Hands HAVE you ever noticed how Bauer brings his hands in when he comes out to playHe carries them as if he didn t want to brush them against anythingfor fear they would strike out music from whatever they touchedOr as if they were precious violins that might be brokenZoluaga THERE is an exhibition of Zoluaga touring the galleries of

magazine has just arrivedBe happyYou are sowing seeds of BeautyYou dig into the earthcut the worm in twobring the chrysallis to the light that it may fluter is wingsand even he mole mile blinks and maybe after a while may seeAllan TannerChicagoWhy so much worship of Bauer s artHe is a mere man who has approached the goal of art through human effort through such a material thing as hard practiceAnybody will tell you that when he was in Paris he was not even out of the ordinary in technical skilland that he really transgressed the pianoThose beautiful tonal effects are only mechanical things done to perfectionWhile Paderewski that spiritual thing who dares not even listen to his own breathingwho makes the piano a living thingcapable of everythingThat godwho was born to touch the piano with such divine significance that you sometimes dare not listenWith Bauer it is only that you can listen so wonderfully beautiful it isIt is the same with Mary GardenThere you have that same spiritual thingWith Paderewski it is now serenityWith Mary Garden it is the sameAnd Bauer can never reach that for he is not born into itPaderewski may sometimes play badly make mistakes but that is only when something material disturbs or penetrates that far a way vision that mind which communes with spaceWhen Bauer expresses passion it is only that physical nervous tensionBut when Paderewski playsIt is that scarlet colored heat which dims the light of day This sounds like my own ravings in the early days of The Little Reviewwhen I talked straight out of the air without anything to back up my wordsSo I will have to excuse youBut if you re going to talk aboutspirit with any meaning behind ityou will have to give up those wild phrases likecommuning with spaceandthe goal of art through human effortand that very awfuldimming the light of day I heard a woman say the other day that Marcella Craftspiritualizedthe role of Salome because she made her a spoiled child instead of what she really was a woman in whom sex had become too mad a thingHow such denials of the essence of things can becomespiritualizationsis beyond my comprehensionI supposeby the same reasoningthat because Mary Garden understands that drama ofnature too heavily ladenher performance should be called amaterialization The Little Review 19 What do you mean when you say that Paderewski has that spiritual thing and Bauer has not is notborn into it Any one with the slightest discrimination of human values will know from one glance at the two men that Paderewski was born with the look of a magician and that Bauer was born with the look of a makerBoth qualities are matters ofspirit What vague mist is in your mind when you talk ofspiritual And what is this about transgressing the pianoAs you sayPaderewski makes the piano capable of everythingThat is what nearly all other pianists have tried to doBut the piano isn t capable of everythingIt is capable of some very special thingsand Bauer is the first man to prove itHe has stood for that all alone in a world of ignorant criticismNospirit And then what do you mean byout of the ordinary in technical skill Is that one of your criterions of an artDon t you remember Arthur Symons saying that it isn t what you can perform but what you can conceiveMCA Alice Groff AgainAlice GroffPhiladelphiaIn answer to Clive Bellin the November issueI would saywords are easyWhat doessignificant formmeanWho is to decide what issignificant form An art form may be divinely significant to one mindand be utterly insignificantindeed without form at allto anotherThere is only one absolutely necessary condition to a good work of artwithout which indeed no work of art can be brought into beingevenand that iscreative artistic faculty in the mind of some one artistThere is no human being or group of human beings capable of deciding whether such expression or embodiment of an artist s creative faculty is a work of art or notThe artist alone can decide as to his own work and leave it to evolution and time to bring a portion at least of humanity to agree with himMeanwhile the petty critics continually spew out of their mouths the greatest miracles of art that have ever been given to the world Answer this nowif words are so easyI suppose if the sun were taken out of the universe tomorrow everything would hold its place as now and keep on goingThe universe would hold without its significant formDo you think we are talking of the shape of a vase when we say it has significant formI don t see where you get the word insignificant out of this talk eitherYou are like those people who talk about good and bad artThere isn t any such thing as bad artthere is Art and rotten stuffAnd who decides whether or not a man hascreative artistic faculty According to your generosity any one can elect himself an artistYou are the woman who is always writing about art being the embodiment of an idealWhat s the ideal in OEdipus Rex or in Salome or in the Mona Lisain any of themAnd speaking of idealswhat is the art in Uncle Tom s Cabin I am sick at my heart and I want to lie down An Artist The Little Review Let Them Fight It OutLouise Gebhard CannSeattleThis came out of me after reading MrPuteklisletter in the January Little ReviewI notice that all my socialist and anarchist friends hold a similar viewone going so far as to declare in the course of an argument on art with a well known etcher that his etchings could not live because they did not portray the struggles of the massesBeing in principle an anarchist myselfand sympathetic towards much of socialismI cannot speak as an antagonist to these people but as one of their number who sees that on this point of art s purpose they are mistakenMrPuteklis s communication reminded me again of the misconception of art s essence noticeable among various classes of those today who possess what they termsocial consciousness For though it is true that the strongest names in contemporary literaturepaintingsculpture are those of men and women who in some extreme way are opposed to the existent social orderand the only being capable of producing profound and significant art is of revolutionary mindessentiallyneverthelesswe find in the socialistic university professoras when DrCox of the University of Washington writes in The South Atlantic Quarterly ofThe Distemper of Modern Art and its Remedyin the intelligent working man and the revolutionary workerthe same misunderstanding of art that we suffer from in the well to do bourgeois and in the church and other capitalistic institutionswith the same determination to degrade art to some form of direct utilityThe communal art of the past ncessarily served the emotional life of the communityIt was thehandmaiden as MrPuteklis puts it of oppression and superstition Much of pre modern painting and sculptureas we all so well knowwas not painting and sculpture per seIt was merely symbols used like language for information on extrinsic topics by means of illustrationA fallacy lurks in the too close judging of modern arts and institutions by their ancient historyArt as part of human progress has its revolutionsOnce weak and a slave to ideas alien to itselftodayby recognition of the truth that it is entitled to its own intrinsic lifeit is rapidly becoming muscular and self sufficientThose who continually regard modern art in the light of its history obstruct the progress of artfor in the course of art s century long process of coming to itselfa transmutation took placethe precise moment of which is difficult to seizeand the aspect engendered by this transmutation is so different from the ancient aspects of art that many nonplused by it or dazzledor blinded to ignorance of itfail to grasp the fact of its quite complete newnessBy this one would not be understood as saying that the history of art is illogical and contains bottomless and wide gulfsThe modern mind deeply cognizant of evolved art can trace relationship just as an anthropologist can trace the steps in the evolution of manbut we all admit in this latter department of human knowledge the looseness of judging modern man by the cave manWe concede modern man to be an entirely different being a being in whom the struggle for animal existence is vastly complicated and modified as compared to his primitive ancestorwhose motives would be unseizable by that ancestorand whose sensualexpressiveintellectualmoral and aesthetic forces have attained a volume which would The Little Review 21 overwhelm to the mereness of a wolf or a bear that progenitorIt is not for nothing that humanity has the vision of going beyond itself the vision of the more thanhumanSomewhere in the history of animal lifespirit slipped in and we have a new speciesSomewhere about the time of Cezanneor a trifle earlierfrom the old communal pictorial representations of sindeathChristianitythe will to be itself slipped into painting and today we are witnessing the evolution through several varieties of manifestation of a new species of artWe of today are not discussing in contemporary art the old art of the Renaissancebeautiful as that revelation wasWe are not discussing art as the Greeks understood it nor as the Japanese of the past understood itnor the IndiansWe are discussing the new speciesthe birth of which we have almost ourselves witnessedBut now we need an Emmanuel Kantwho in a Critique on Pure Art will investigate tor us art s necessary limits and authentic nature and free it for us from its inheritance of superstitionTruly much of thesocial visiontoday is blindas blind as the vision of any fanaticThose who are under its spelland one does not deny it to be a world renovating spellon the wholeare determined to halt art and shackle it with the command that it serve themasses These humanitarians are still deluded by the idea that subject is the important part of artthey would retain art as a part of informative literature denying it even the right to be a literature of power and they would have it reduced to the level of illustration for the propaganda of socialism and anarchyThis attitude is tyrannicaland it is a refusal to allow art its place under the sunThose of true social vision should perceive that all the forces of lifeand are is perhaps the most potent should be accepted and allowed to lift humanity along their courseThe human spirit is broader and deeper than mere class consciousnessfor among other consciousnesses it includes the consciousness of the rights of the masses as against those who deny those rightsIf we narrow all our activity to a direct service of social bettermentwe shall never attain social bettermentfor this conditionlike the condition of happinessor healthor any other valued stateis missed by a too narrow and direct seekingArt fulfilling itself will be an inexhaustible source of powermental and moral fertilizationof vitalizing spiritual life to all who come within its influenceBut art reduced to illustration of class strugglebound in service to mere social consciousnesswill soon turn sterile and will fail to inspire even those it servesIt is significant that only those individualities that have attained self realizationtrue freedom have inspired and lead humanityThe same must be true of any spiritual movementArt s strength today is in its revolutionary characterAnd the revolution of artlike the social revolution which accompanies it in the world s awakeningwill react beneficially on the human spirithelping it to ever greater realizations and liberationsBut artas suchcannot even exist if ENSLAVED to the social movement22 The Little ReviewThis month really begins the fourth year of The Little Reviewbut since

native countrysave to a few literary peoplewho knew that he had written sonic volumes of stories and a book full of sunshiny reminiscences from SpainAnd even nowafter his great success withPelle very little is known about the writerHe was born in 1869in one of the poorest quarters of Copenhagenbut spent his boyhood in his beloved islandBornholmin the Balticin or near the town Nexofrom which his final name is derivedTheretoohe was a shoemaker s apprenticelike Pelle in the second part of the hookwhich resembles many great novels in being largely autobiographicalLater he gained his livelihood as a bricklayeruntil he somehow managed to get to one of the most renowned of ourpeople s high schools where he studied so effectually that he was enabled to become a teacherfirst at a provincial schooland later in Copenhagen Pelleconsists of four partseachexcept perhaps the lasta complete story in itselfFirst we have the open air life of the boy in country surroundings in Bornholmthen the lad s apprenticeship in a small provincial townnot yet invaded by modern industrialism and still innocent of socialism nextthe youth s struggle in Copenhagen against employers and authoritiesand lastthe man s final victory for the benefit of his fellow workersThe background everywhere is the rapid growth of the labor movement but social problems are never obtrudedexceptagainin the last partand the purely human interest is always kept well before the reader s eye through variety of situation and vividness of characterization The great charm of the book seems to me to lie in the fact that the writer knows the poor from withinhe has not studied them as an outsider maybut has lived with them and felt with themat once a participant and a keen eyed spectatorHe is no sentimentalistand so rich is his imagination that he passes on rapidly from one scene to the nextsketching often in a few pages what another novelist would be content to work out into long chapters or whole volumesHis sympathy is of the widestand he makes us see tragedies behind the little comediesand comedies behind the little tragediesof the seemingly sordid lives of the working people whom he lovesPellehas conquered the
