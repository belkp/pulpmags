No4Journalism in ChicagoCARY succeeds like an indiscretionI was indiscreet enough last IN winter to speak my minda little of itabout TH E LITTLE Review The DialPoetryThe Dramaand the audience to which these papers appealThe result is that I have been flattered or intimidated into speaking it ever sinceIn the present instance both methods have been used most charminglyand shamelesslyYou seeMiss Anderson and I live in the same villageAnd yet I said nothingand have nothing to say about any paper except what everybody knows knows that The Friday Literary Review of The Chicago Evening Post under MrFrancis Hackett andlaterunder MrFloyd Dell gave us the most alertthe most eagerthe most intelligentand the best written discussion of literature in the United StatesThat eight page supplement did what had hardly been done west of England before it made book reviews worth readingThere was almost as much difference between the Friday Review and The Dial as there is between MrGeorge Bernard Shaw and MrNicholas Murray Butleralmost as much difference between the Friday Review and The New York Times Literary Supplement as there is between MAnatole France and MrHenry Van DykeThere was good writing in the Friday Review and good thinking behind itIt was almost never dull and if it was young it was not wholly unsophisticated and if it was sometimes dead wrong it was not stupidIf there were half as many persons interested in the discussion of ideas as most of us like to believe the Friday Review would inevitably have continuedIt wouldthat s allBut as things are it was fatedNeither the mechanics nor the economics of daily journalism permitted itThe Post could not continue to give usit quite literally gave useight pages of what so few of us wanted so muchEverybody knows that if a weekly paper dealing not only with literature but with all the other arts in the spirit and with the journalistic competence of the Friday Review were established in Chicago everybody would have to read itis the point I wished to makeIt is perfectly obvious that THE LITTLE REVIEW is not the kind of newspaper of the arts I have in mindTH E LITTLE REVIEW is published only once a monthIt is therefore not a newspaperbut a magazineIt is three times as good as The Dramawhich is published only once a quarterBut my point is that we ought to have something four times as good as TH E LITTLE REVIEW in shorta weeklyIt may be that T H E LITTLE REVIEW has other failings than its infrequencyBut why consider these lesser mattersTH E LITTLE REVIEW has one virtue in addition to its eagernessIt is informalInformality is the breath of life to journalismNobody can write anything the way people want him to unless he feels perfectly free to write the way he wants toIt is far more a matter of manners than a matter of truthA journal which insists on formality almost never has any good writing in itGood writing is nothing but the artistic expression of a personalityScientifically speakingit can be nothing elseNot that one must be thinking about expressing his personality in order to write wellThe very point is that he must not be thinking about itHe has got to be thinking about what he has to say and nothing elseTake the use ofIas an apparently trivial but actually significant exampleIf the paper for which he is writing regards the use ofIas a breach of good form a man will find that one finger of his left hand is mysteriously drawn to the shift key and one finger of his right hand to the key between theuand theoin order to make anIall the time he is punching his typewriterThe least excusable riot ofI sI ever saw in print was in a journal of literary discussion which believes in the reality of that invention of the old fashioned logician objective criticism and which regards the use ofIby any but elderly gentlemen of the walnuts and wine school as impossibleI did it myself in the absence of the editorIn a paper which does not in the least object to the use ofIwriters soon forget all about itand when they do that they begin to use it only when it is effectiveIt is the virtue of TH E LITTLE REVIEW that it permits its contributors to useIas often as they pleasethat it permits them to make fools of themselves occasionallyThis means that it is not impossible to write well for TH E LITTLE REVIEWI do not say that it is not possible to write badly for TH E LITTLE REVIEWPerfect freedom to be idiotic does not inevitably eliminate idiocy I have no more compliments for TH E LITTLE REVIEWis another matterMiss Monroe s magazine has printed some bad verseBut this is notas its most envious critics imagineits distinctionEvery magazine prints bad versePoetry has printed poetry that nobody else dared to printPoetry has boldly discussed the poetic controversy when everybody else hid behind languagePoetry introduced us to Rabindranath Tagoreto Vachel Lindsayin a wayto Edgar Lee MastersPoetry printed Ford Hueffer s poem On HeavenPoetry has heard of Remy de Gourmont and the Mercure de France an incredible achievement for a Chicago literary journalPoetry has done more than any other paper to furnish a meeting ground for writers in ChicagoIf Poetry were concerned about novels it would not decide two or three years after intelligent people had discovered Jean Christophe that MRomain Rolland is a successor to Tolstoi andfor the first timeprint a few paragraphs about himIf Poetry were interested in psychology it would not ignore Sigmund Freud and Carl JungBut Poetry is not interested in these thingsIts great wealth is devoted only to poetry and it comes out only once a monthIt is a pityFor the spirit of Poetry is nearer to the spirit of the old Friday Literary Review than anything else in ChicagoThat is the spirit I likethat seems suited to the place and the occasionBut it needs a weekly paper of wide scope to express itselfA man is an artist to the extent to which he regards everything that inartistic people callformas

through the long forenoonIn the midst of itwe each looked up and out through the barred window to the nearest elmwhere a song sparrow had just finished a perfect expression of the thing as he felt itThe song was more elaborateperhapsbecause the morning was lofty and gloriousOld Mother Nature smelled like a tea rose that morningone would know from that without the sense of direction that the wind was from the southThe song from the sunlight among the new elm leaves was so joyous that it choked usIt stood out from all the songs of the morningbecause it was so nearand we had each been called by it from the pleasant mystery of our tasks little girl leaned toward the windowWe heard the other bird answer from the distanceand then ours sang again and againWe sipped the ecstacy in the hushesLike a flicker the little bird was gone a leaning forward on the branchand then a blur and presently the words in the roomsang four songs and flew awaywas a word portraitand told me much that I wantedThe numberof coursewas not mentalclearly a part of the inner impressionHoweverno explanation will help if the art of the saying is not apparentI told the thing as it is hereto a class later in the dayand a woman saidthose six words make a Japanese poem wonder if it is orientalRather I think it belongs especially to our new generationthe elect of which seems to know innately that an expression of truth in itself is a master strokeSomehow the prison house has not closed altogether upon the elect of the new generationThere are lines in the new poetry that could come forthand have their beingonly from the inner giant that heretofore has been asleep except in the hearts of the rarest few whose mothers mated with Godsmerely using men for a symbol and the gift of matterI believe that the literary generation which has the floor in America today is the weakest and the bleakest that ever made semi darkness of good sunlightso I believe that the elect of the new generation contains individuals who are true heaven borns that they bring their own light with them and do not stand about stretched for reflection that they refuse to allow the world lie to shut the passages of power within thembetween the zone of dreams and the more temperate zones of matterThey have refused to accept us that is the splendid truthnew generation does not argue with usThey are not a race of talkersThey do not accept what they find and begin to build upon thatas all but the masters have done heretoforeThey are making even their own footings and abutmentsAnd to such clean and sure beginnings magic strength has comeThe fashions and the mannerisms which we knew and thought of as the heart of things the artfulness of speech and written wordthe age of advertising which twisted its lie into the very physical structure of our brains the countless reserves and covers to hide our want of inspirationfor light cannot pass through a twisted passageall thesethe new age has put awayIt meets life face to face and a more subtle and formidable devil is required for its workers than that which seduced usfew great workmen heretofore have come up in the lieand in midlifethe sutures closing they were warned because they had labored like menFor their work s sake and for their religionwhich is the same to great menthey perceived that they must tear the lie out of their heartseven if they bled to deathWe call it their illuminationbut it was a very deep and dark passage for themExcept that ye become as little childrenthat was all they knewperhapsbut quite enoughAnd the old masters invariably put their story down for us to read RodinPuvis de ChavannesWhitmanBalzacTolstoi only to mention a little group of the nearer names all have told the storyIn their later years they told no other story the beginning they served menas they fancied men wanted to be servedbut after they confronted the lie of itthey dared to listen to reality from their own natureThey fought the fight for that cosmic simplicity which is the natural flowering of the child mindand which modern education patronizingly dresses down at every appearanceThe masters wrenched open with all their remaining strength the doors of the prison houseand become more and more like children unto the endI do not ask a finer fate than to write about the New Age and Children and Education by Children for THE LITTLE REVIEWI think of you as one of its throbbing centersI can say it better than that ILittle Review 7 of you as a brown Arabian tent in which the world s desire is just rousing from sleepI would like to be one of the larks of the morningwhose song makes it impossible for you to doze againI would not come too near lest you find me oldthe brandings of past upon meYet because of the yearsI think I know what will be thatmore formidable and subtle devilwaiting to make you forget your way is not a strangerHe is always near when people dare to be simpleThere are many who call him a God stillbut they do not use their eyesYou who see so directly must never forget that bad curve of him below the shouldersForeverthe artists lying to themselves have tried to cover that bad curve of Pan as it sweeps down into the haunches of a goatPan is the first devil you meet when you reach that rectitude of heart which dares to be naked and unashamedraces of artists have lied about Pan because they listened to the haunting music of his pipesIt calls sweetlybut does not satisfyHow many Pan has called and left them sitting among the rocks with mindless eyes and hands that fiddle with emptiness Pan is so sad and level eyedHe does not explainHe does not promise too wise for thatHe lures and enchantsHe makes you pity him with a pity that is red as the lusts of fleshknow that red in the breast It is the red that drives away the dream of peaceyet the pity of him deludes youYou look again and againand the curve of his back does not break the dreamas beforeYou think that because you pity himyou cannot fall and all the pull of the ground tells you that your very thought of falling is a breath from the old shamesyour deadbut as yet unburied heritagefrom generations that learned the lie to itselftouch the hair of the goatand say it is NatureBut Pan is not Nature a hybridhalf of man s makingratherYour eyes fall to the cloven hoofbut return to the level steady eyesmiling with such soft sadness that your heart quickens for himand you listenas he saysAll Gods have animal bodies and cloven hoofsbut I alone have dared to reveal mineHow brave you areYour heart answersand the throb of him bewilders you with passionYou who are so high must fall farwhen you let goAnd many of you will want to fallPan has come to you because you dareYou have murdered the old shamesyou have torn down the ancient and mouldering churchesYou do not require the bloodthe thornthe spikesbut I wonder if even you of a glorious generationdo not still require the CrossIt is because you see so surely and are level eyed that Pan is back in the world for youand it is very strange but true that you must first meet Pan and pass him bybefore you can enter into the woodlands with that valid God of Naturewhose back is a challenge to aspirationand whose feet are of the purity of the saintsTo M slavekiss your lips abloomyou not hear the surging voices the tomb you guard the candles of the deadyou not hear the

worldbe united for the less noble mottoDefend your country Even when the European armies had already been mobilized the Socialists held protest meetings at which they threatened to call a general strike if war should be declaredBut with the first cannon boom the theoretic brotherhood evaporated and gave way to patriotic sentimentsThe workers declared that they were GermansRussiansetc firstthen SocialistsTruein the beginning the German Socialists claimed that they were fighting against the reactionary Czardomwhile the Socialists of the Allies tried to justify the international carnage as the struggle against Prussian militarismbut ultimately such clear headed thinkers as Kautsky and some of the English Socialists came to see the futility of endeavoring to discover idealistic causes for the mutual slaughterThe country is in dangerconsequently we must defend itregardless of the Tightness or wrongness of its policythis is the prevailing sentiment among the workersThe grandiose

other hand appliedSocialism has won a considerable victory with the development of the warNearly all the belligerent countries have adopted State Socialism in such measures as the nationalization of

ever heard MrBryan pronounce it you will know what I meanHe says itpeo pulAnd that is the way they actSometimes I see peo pul in this kind of picture a cosmic squirming mass of black caterpillars moving first one way and then the otherslowly and vaguelynot like measuring worms who cover the ground or like ants who have their definite businessbut heavilyblindlyin the stunned manner peculiar to caterpillar organismsThey peer and poke and nod and ponder and creep and crawl and scramble and grow dizzy and turn around and aroundwondering whether they shall go on the way they started or go back the way they came or refuse to go at allOnce in a hundred years one of the caterpillars breaks his skin and flies away a butterfly through the unfriendly airThen the black mass writhes in protest and arranges that the next butterfly shall have his wings well clippedI know my metaphor is not scientifically intactbut what does it matterIt satisfies my impulse which is simply to call namesSo I might as well sayPeople are caterpillarsand be done with ithave a painter artist friend who says that to talk about the artist in life is simply to repeat one of those silly phrases that mean nothingBut it means entirely too muchI think which is the reason there are so many of the species in evidenceabout two in a million perhaps and I know that is far too optimisticThat would mean some four or five thousand people in the living world who have nothing in common with caterpillarsThe count is too high really there are no artists among usLiving picturesquelyartisticallyhas nothing to do with being an artist in life and even living with the poise that marks a good piece of art hasn t necessarily anything to do with itIf you ask me to choose a type of the real artist in life I shall say Nietzsche rather than GoetheFor the artist in life has inevitably to do with prophecy rather than with holding up the mirrorand that means chiefly to have strength Now where are the strong peopleOf coursestrengthis an indefinite termSometimes it seems a matter of dominating the superfluous sometimes it seems the powerto meet fate with an equal gazeand sometimes the resource or the daring to push one s fate to a farther goalBut these are beginningsIf you pick up what is known as your soul from a Little Review and make it march on you think you are very strongIf you manage to make it march with pride and joy you think you are a SupermanBut this is easily within the effort of EverymanI am talking of artists now and of the radiant possibility that such beings may develop in this uninspired land andin these termsto be strong is to help create the farther goaldisgusting to realize that the people we know are not this sortTake any twenty of your friends and classify them briefly as typesPerhaps there are five who havepersonalitybut one of them has no energyone no willone no brainsone no imaginationand the other nospirit there are five who haveintellect one of them has nocharacter one no strengthone can t see or hear or feelone sees so inclusively that he has no goaland one sees sostraightthat he misses the road on both sides there are five who have a capacity for art one is lazyone is ignorantone is afraidone is vainone has a lie in him and there are five who have a capacity for livingone can t thinkone can t workone can t persevereone can t stand aloneone wastes his gift on others and never realizes himselfYou can work out such combinations ad infinitum and you can excuse them to the same distance by calling it all a matter of having the defects of your qualitiesWhy not call it a matter of having the complacency of your defects you ve not got imagination you can t help it if you ve not got strength you can get itIt won t make you an artist but it will make it impossible for you to be confused with the caterpillarsIf you ve got a vision an Idea and can find the strength to fly toward it you ll be an artist in lifeThis is not to confuse the artist with the prophetYou can t very well do that because the terms are so interdependentThere has never been an artist without the prophet in himand there has never been a prophet who was not an artistIt s a different thing if you re talking about priests or about inferior artistsAnd then of course you have to remember that there are no such things as inferior artistsPriest and demagogue are the names for those who fail as prophets or as artistswhat is the use of such a harangueThere is very little usePeople won t be artistsPeo pul don t changeBut the individual changesand that is the hopeIndividuals are persons who can stand aloneThere ought to be Individuals coming out of a generation brought up on NietzscheSuch an upbringing has taught us at least two thingsfirst that he who goes forward goes aloneand second that it is weakness rather than nobility to succumb to the caterpillarsYesand something elsethat it is from superabundance rather than from hunger that creation comesWe start out fortified with all thisWe don t need to wrestle with our gods every time the old laws threaten to submerge us our universe doesn t totter when the caterpillars groan that we will be loneley if we go alone or hurt if we are misunderstood or tragic if we don t compromiseWe don t mind these thingsreally all comes to one end Life for Art s sakeWe believe in that because it is the only way to get more Life a finer qualitya higher vibrationThis bigger concept doesn t mean merely more BeautyIt means more IntensityIn shortit means the New HellenismAnd that is a step beyond the old Greek ideal of proportion and moderationIt pushes forward to the superabundance that dares abandonment and nothing else Art is the great means of making life possiblethe great seducer to lifethe great

to be an embodiment of inspired opinionan abandonment of mental emotionYouthLike some of the people who read it and even some of them who write for itit flies at the throats of contemporary Chimeras and leaps upon the Pegasi of the momentIt slashes and roarshates and lovesIt never considers the right and never considers the wrongIt does not endeavor to be just and fairThis is at once a great crime and a great virtueIt is criminal to be unjust and it is virtuous to be truthfulTo me THE LITTLE REVIEW is always bothI sympathize with its spirit and share itLeave justice to the greybeardsWhy should a soul which has the capacity for inspiration quibble in prejudicesI thinkhoweverthat shuddering at mediocrities is a grave errorEvil is the monopoly of the few as well as geniusHating and loving them are luxuriesTherefore it is that this writing is not composed in the luxurious spirit of THE LITTLE REVIEWMy opinion is not an inspired onemy emotion is not an abandonmentI write with a photographic dispassion of the three great divisions of mediocrity SlobberdomSneerdomand Boredomis not an art and it is not an evilIt is not even important except as an object of analysisTrueif encountered in print or in the flesh it is likely to have a nauseous effect upon sensitive soulsbut then one can easily avoid encountering itOne does notfor instancehave to attend a Walt Whitman dinnerWhen one hears that a Walt Whitman dinner is to be given on a certain night in the Grand Pacific Hotel all one has to do to remain happy and free from suffering is to stay at homeMy friend Kand I went to a Walt Whitman dinner because we were young and curious and hungryand because Waltafter allis a great artist dinner proved to be like most dinners of its kind a glorious opportunity for saccharine drool at the expense of a great nameAppreciation and love of an artist a poet are highly commendable qualities if practiced in privateif put into proper printIt is the same as with love of a womanBut to stand up in a public placeto shed tears of ecstasywave one s armspull at one s hair and strike at one s bosom these areas they always have beenthe slobbering methods of egotistical mediocrityIt is simply a prostituting of the emotionsis not insensible to artIt is very probable that the RevPreston Bradleywho insists he is a reformed clergymanreally likes Walt Whitmanfeels thrilled with the reading of himBut the joy the RevBradley derives from reading Walt in his library is not enough for himIn factit is not a joy at allIt is an irritationGive the RevBradley an opportunity to show what he thinks of Walt Whitmanto stand up on his feet before three hundred and fifty sympathetic souls and prove what a keen sense of taste and an advanced instinct of culture heRevBradleypossesses by yawpinglove WhitmanI adore WhitmanHe is this to meHe is that to meand not till then does the RevBradley feel the real joy of appreciation forgood olddear oldwonderful old Walt Give the RevBradley a decent chance to platitudinizeattitudinizeand blatitudinizeand the love he bears old Walt oozes from him in dewy sighs and briny wordsnot imagine that I am violently indignant with the RevBradleyor wish the reader to befor his insincerityIt is indeed one of his best qualitiesBy being insincereby having no actual ground for his ecstacythe RevBradley mustperforcepay a great deal of attention to what he saysHe is free to pick out the best wordsthe best posethe most arresting and perhaps enlightening point of viewI say he is free to do thisbut of course he doesn tIt is not the fault of his insincerityhoweverIf the RevBradley were an artist he would profit by it and be greatBut why all this talk about such a person as the RevBradleySurely not because he is deserving of careful censureThe reason is that there were at least three hundred male and female RevBradleys listening to himslobbering in silencenow the next division of mediocrityMrCarence Darrow was another of the talkersMrDarrow sneeredMrDarrow sneered at HomerEuripidesShakespeareDanteLandorWhittierTennysonMiltonKiplingand Heine because they didn t write as good old Walt wroteBecause they wore fetters in their art and insisted on making the last word in the first line rhyme with the last word in the third lineThey were weakignoble creaturesthese copybook writerssaid MrDarrowthey insisted on using a singular subject with a singular predicate and believed that a violation of such procedure was a sinOne of the things you learn in your school text books on physics is that a gentleman by imposing a pencil point before his eye can obscure his vision of the ColossusThe idea seems apropos in the Little Reviewof MrDarrowMrDarrow by imposing his soul upon the figures of the world s big men can obscure them entirely for himself and evidently his sympathizersAfter he had concluded three hundred and fifty personsevery one present so far as I could see except my friend K and myselfstood up and sneered with MrDarrowThey passed him a rising resolution of love and cheered him three timesomittinghoweverthe customary tigergreatest trouble with MrDarrow was his sincerityHe didn t slobber any more than a public speaker has to in order to have a public to speak toBut his sneers were deep and earnestThey were entirely intellectualthe intellectual essence of mediocrityAll of us sneerof courseThe sneer is the one great American characteristicWhen I told a man in the office in which I work that I had attended a Walt Whitman dinner he sneered at mehe said I can t see how you put that highbrow stuff overA lot of long hairedflea ridden radicalsain t I rightI wouldn t let my wife associate with a bunch like thatis my office friend s highest conception of manly virtuea thoroughly American onebeing careful of whom his wife associates with my office friend went on to assert that Whitman was undoubtedly an immoralnot to say degeneratepartythat hegot by with his stuff because it was raw and that everybody who professed any admiration for him was a suspicious character and one hewould think twice about before inviting to his home where his wife is is rather a complicated matterthis sneering business and after attending a Walt Whitman dinner I don t know whose sneers disgust me moreMrDarrow s or my friend sThey are bothhoweveridentical in spiritthe spirit of mediocrity and sincerity when sincerity becomesas it most always doesthe cloak for ignorant convictions and bigoted fanaticismnow we come to the third and last condition boredomAmong the speakers at this memorable dinner was MrLlewellyn JonesMrJones is a critic of literature by profession if not qualification although I do not say itreallyOf all the orators at good old Walt s memorial gabfest MrJones was the least offensiveHe said nothing that shocked the taste or violated one s innerself or harrowed one s soulI don tof courseremember what MrJones did sayOne never doesnot only in the case of MrJones but in the thousands like himThey occupy time and space and leave them emptyNot for them the sneer or the slobberMrJones wouldn t sneer for the worldAnd as for slobbering MrJones has too much good taste and discretion for thatNot that he is above themHis fear of themhis apparent uncertainty in distinguishing between these two characteristics and the characteristics of inspired opinionindicate this plainly enoughto be safe MrJones resorts to the time honored entrenchment of mediocrityHe barricades himself behind the bulwarks of boredomHe discharges no cannonhe commits no sinshe makes no false steps or takes no Little Review 25 flightsHe is boredom incarnatethe eternal convention in the arts whether he deals with Nihilismradicalismor stands pat on the isms of the pastMrJones never gets anywhereI repeatI speak of all the JonesesNobody derives anything from him from them except ennuiHetheynever offendnever elateHetheyare always MrJonesto the Joneses is as elevating an experience as watching the water blop blop out of the kitchen hydrantAnd this idea leads me back to where I started THE LTTLE REVIEWyou imagine what a thorough contempt a kitchen hydrant would have for a fountain rising from the rocksfor a brook gurgling down the hillsideor a strong river capering to seaIt wouldn t exactly sneer at themMrJones doesn tBut it would feel moved to spirited reproofHow juvenile it is to gurglethe hydrant would sayhow vain and foolish it is to rise from the rockshow upsetting it is to be continually capering to seaI do not claim any super intelligence in the matter of hydrantsBut MrJones and all the Joneses do sayand I have enough intelligence to understand them if not to sympathize with themthat THE LITTLE REVIEW is young and idiotic and given to unnecessary emotions and so forthAll of which is truelooked at from the elevation of a kitchen sink Why don t you remonstrates the hydrant to the brook blop blop with meafterthoughtat this Whitman dinner there was one among the speakers who sustained a dying faith in Walthumanityand vers libre in generalHe was Carl Sandburg who read a free verse poem of his own on Billy SundayIt is provided in the essence of things that from any fruition of successno matter whatshall come forth something to make a greater struggle necessaryWhitmanDeath of Anton Tarasovitch Short Story of the Present WarKIPER FRANKTARASOVITCH lay dyingHe lay in a pleasant cornfieldhe had dragged himself in the heat of the afternoonfor a shelter against the merciless sunBut now it was evening and the stars were outand dying was not now so bad an affair as it had been in the dust and the blinding sunlightTruethe pain was at times terriblebut at other times it made one only light headedso that oneself or the part that was Anton Tarasovitch seemed to be a different thing altogether from the body of Anton Tarasovitch which lay beneath It shot to pieceswhile It fluttered and hovered abovehad not been lying for many hours in the Austrian cornfieldHe knew that by the progress of the sun downward downward until it made the long summer shadows that he loved in the fields at home downward until it brought a breath of coolness and a gray light that had brushed out the clear distinction of shadows and sunlight downward until it was gone forever and a few stars burned quietly in the sky overheadIt was the last sunset that Anton Tarasovitch was to see in this worldBut time had no longer any meaning for Anton TarasovitchLying on one s backsoand waiting to diea minute can seem all there is of the worldand then an hour can be burned up like a minutewhile one faints into unconsciousnessbefore one is slowly dragged back again to the thought I am Ithe thought that makes the world for each manthat creates for him the stars and the shadows and the sun sinking downwardAnton Tarasovitch knew that now that it was this thought that made the worldAnd when he stopped thinking itthe world would again be nothingDowndowndownone would plungeand then the world would be nothingBut it would exist still for other menYet how could that beTomorrow the sun would come up again into the sky just as every day it had come up in the fields at homemaking the long shadows that he had so loved in the mornings and in the eveningsTomorrow other men would see the sun many other men would see itBut if Anton Tarasovitch did not see it In vain he struggled to create for himself a universe in which there would be no Anton TarasovitchWellhe was not clever enough to understand such mattersMen in universities and men who wrote books had figured them out and knew all about themBut how was hewho had never been to a Universitywho had not been to school evento understand this much he understood that he was dying for his countryThis the general had told themand he had known alwayssince a boythat it was a brave and fine thing to fight for one s country and to die if need beAnton Tarasovitch was dying that his country might be savedit was strange that the big Russia had need of himjust one common peasantThe great Russia had so many men that were strong and powerfulmen with uniforms that glittered men that were much cleverer and braver than AntonWhy should the country have need of himSasha needed himand the childrenSasha needed him in the fields and she needed him in her heart tooShe had often called him the light of her heartin the strange words so different from the words of other women that Sasha often usedAnd he knew by her face that she needed himShe didn t have to tell him soHe knew by the kindling of her faceas of a curtain behind which suddenly a candle appearsSo her face would light up when she saw himSasha would mind greatly if she never saw him againwas dying because it was a glorious thing to die for one s countryfor the White Tsarthe little FatherYou died to protect your countryso that your great country might live foreverBut if you weren t there to know that it lived forevernow why couldn t he think of the world without Anton Tarasovitch in itWhy did he land against a black wall every time he tried to think of tomorrow without Anton Tarasovitch was needful that he die to save his countryWhat ifto the generalhe were only one of thousands and to Sasha and the children all of lifeneverthelessif every man should think thatthen there would be no one at all to save the countryIt was rather clever of him to figure it out soespecially with the fire in his side that made his head so light and his thoughts fly off from it and refuse to anchor down for more than a minuteIt was clever of him to reason it out Anton Tarasovitch who had never been to a Universitythat if every man should say to himself OI don t countJust one more or lessthen there would be no army at all to fight the Tsar s battleshe was not fighting or dying now to save SashaNor was he dying to save his children even in the years to comeThat wouldn t be bad to die so that years afterwardseven though it might be many years afterwardsone s children would prosper and would live more happilyThat would be a sort of living when one was deadbecause one s children were in a way oneself in different bodiesBut he couldn t see how Maxim and Ignat and Sofya and Tatya would at any time be better off because he was dying right nowHe couldn t see but that the land would be poorer and that they would have to work harder because he and the other peasants were dying for the Little Father and for their countryif he couldn t figure out just what people he was savingat least he knew against what men he was fightingHe was fighting against the AustriansThe Austrians were a horrible people who spoke a language one couldn t understand at allWhen you tried to understand themyou couldn t understand a word they were sayingHe had known an Austrian once a big blonde fellow who had stayed a few days at their little villageOne day Anton had been walking with the tiny Tatya on the road that led to the market and they had met the Austrianwho had stopped and had given Tatya a flower out of his button holeAnton remembered Tatya s crows of delightThe Austrian had smiled at hera nicefriendly smileand Tatya had grabbed for his hand as children willeven when the people they grab at are Austrianshad seemed to like the AustrianAnd Anton had had to confess to himself that he wasn t a bad fellowBut he must have been pleasant only because of TatyaNo one could help being pleasant to TatyaThe Austrian had been for a moment friendly because of herAt heart he was a hateful fellowAll Austrians were hatefulThey all hated the Tsar and the Fatherland and they all hated himAntonbecause he was a Russianmust be some Austrians lying in this cornfield nowwounded as he was woundedBut he could see no oneFlat on his backhe could see only the stars which were thick now against tse skyAnd he began to think that this was a cruel thing that a man should be alone when he was dyingEven when a chap was just illhe wanted someone to take care of himOnce when Anton had been ill of a fever he had been just like a babyso weak and helplessHe had cried then because the milk that Sasha had brought him had been too hot for his tongue and had burned himIt was silly for a big man to crybut that was the way you became when you were sick weak and sillyHe had never in his life cried when he was wellWhen men were well they were never sillywere differentFive times had Sasha been so ill that it was terrible four times for the children that were living and once for the little one that had diedSasha had almost died too that timeShe had been so white and so hopeless looking for weeks after But in all the times she was ill she had not complained as much as he hadthat one month that he was sick with the feverThat must be because women were used to painThe good God had so ordained itFor every life that they brought into the world they had to suffernot only at the timebut for months before and then for years afterward were strange creatureswere womenIf a child became ill or diedits mother suffered againjust as the day she had borne himAt least so Sasha had suffered when the baby had died and other women that he had seen in the villagewas a strange thing now He had never really thought of it beforebut wasn t it a strange thing that each time a person was born into the worldthere should be pain and the long months of waitingThen in one second an Austrian shell could blow away the body that some woman had waited for and had carried in her own bodyIn one second whyso he had been waited forheAnton TarasovitchNow wasn t that wonderfuland he had never until this minute really thought of itHeAnton Tarasovitchhad been carried in the body of his mother and had been born in pain and in rejoicingLittle Review it was like a miracle And he had thought so lightly of ithad just taken it for granted that he should be born and that she should love him would like to make it up to her in some way nowBut it was too lateShe had been dead for very many years now and he also was dyingWellhe could tell her about it when he saw her with the saints in Heaven Heaven He would go thereof coursebecause he had alwayssince a boybeen obedient and had done just what the priests had told himHe ought to think now about HeavenBut somehow he did not care to think about itand the strange part was that it did not trouble him that he did not careEven if he woke tomorrow in Heavenhe would not be the same AntonHe might live foreverbut that wouldn t be the same thing as waking up in the morning with Sasha at his sideHe tried to think whatforevermeantand he fetched up against the same black wall that he had when he had tried to think of a world without Anton Tarasovitch to know himself in itForeverevereverNo stoppingOn and onBut that would be horribleNo no he couldn t bear thatOne could do nothingnothingto get out of itEven if one could be blown to pieces with a gunsay a thousand years from nowin Heavenone s soul would gather itself together again and go on and onforever and foreverhe mustn t think about itIf he thought about it any morehe would lift his hands and strangle himselfso as to be able to stop thinking about itNow he would think about SashaWhen he thought about herhe could feel her right next to himHe couldn t see her face exactlynor could he see her standing thereAnd yet it was as if she really were thereand he could see herThat was the way it was when you loved a personShe wasas it werein youor at least right next to youand yet she was separate from youtoohad liked life with SashaHe didn t know until now how much he had liked itTrueit was a hard life they had lived togetherOne was on the go every minute in bad weather when the frost stung and to walk even a mile became an agony and in good weather one was constantly on the gowhen it might perhaps have been pleasant to sit under the trees and play with the childrenBut life was goodfor all thatOf courseif they could have saved money only a little money it would have been betterBut the little money they could save had had to go for the taxesThe taxes were for the Fatherlandthe priest had told himThe taxes were paid so that when the need cameAnton would be able to die for his countryBut there was something confusing about thatLife would be better if it were not for the taxesand the taxes were paid so that he might nothat was bewilderingWith the fire in one s side and in one s brainhow could one think clearly about so difficult a matterBesidesthere were many matters of that sort that heAnton Tarasovitchwas not clever enough to think aboutOne left such things to the priestswho were good menand to the clever men at the universitiesLittle Review stars were sometimes a long way off now and sometimes very near to himBut neither near nor far away did they seem to care about himThey were the only things he could see in the world and they did not seem to care about himUndoubtedly they had seen many men dyingHe knew about the stars A young teacher who had come to the village when he was a boy had talked about them and Anton had never forgotten young teacher had not stayed long in the villageHe wasdangerous they saidand Anton heard afterwards that he had gone to AmericaIt gave one many thoughts to listen to the teacherHe had said that the stars were worldsjust like our own earth the earth that Anton knew the good Christ had come down to saveAntonwho was just a boyhad wanted to ask him if Christ had had to save all these worlds that were starsBut that was only one of the many confusing thoughts one had in listening to the young teacherOne felt strange in listening to himas if the world weren t solid at allbut were flowing like a river felt very sorry for himselflying there under the stars that did not care for himHe began to cry sillyweak tears that tasted of salt as they touched his mouthIt was only at times that he knew that he was cryingAt other times the soul of him entirely left his body and went shooting up and upto be recaptured only with a struggletwo of them the burning body and the light soul would have held together betterhe knewif someone could grip his hand tightlyAt least that was the way they had done in the feverWhen Sasha had gripped his handas if by a miracle he had been restored for a moment to a complete manand was no longer two pieces a body below and a soul that went fluttering above it only he could touch someone s hand now anyone s hand the hand of a human beingTo be all alone with the cruelflickering stars up abovethat was no way to die snuffed out into the darknessThat was no way for any man to goeven though he were just a peasantBut Anton knew himself important nowalmost as important as a generalHe knew himself importantwith a strangetremendous importanceHe was as important as almost anyone in the worldand he was dying alone in the darknessThen he remembered that there must be other men in the cornfieldHe had thought of that beforeand afterwards he had forgottenIf therewere other men here even one other manan enemy he would find that comrade and they would die

part an inland race spread over the great monotonous PlainLittle Revieware inclined for melancholy introspective searchings and spiritual struggles rather than for actual physical adventuresTheir writers need not create for their heroes an atmosphere of dizzying stunts and elemental cataclismsthey find sufficient dramaticplotin the soul experiences of the restless yearning men and women who dwell not on a South Sea island but in ordinary cities and villagesfighting their human fightswrestling with God and mangaining their ephemeral victoriesbut more often suffering defeatsYetdespite their lack of adventurousnessthe stories of the Russian and Polish writersfrom Dostoevsky to Kuprin and from Orzezsko to Zeromskyhave seldom caused a yawn in their readercheckered life of Conrad has placed a distinct stamp upon his worksdistinct from both the writers of his race and from the Western writersWe observe a dualism in his artan eternal collision between fact and fictionbetween realism and symbolismHis inborn Slavic mysticism is weighed down by the ballast of his rich experiencesand he continually wavers between the Scylla of lyric melancholy and the Charybdis of picturesque plotpreserving the equilibrium at times more and at times less skilfullyThe reader thus finds in Conrad that which he is afterFor my partI am rather distracted by the over complex plot of VictoryI should much prefer to meet Hieyst and Lena in less dizzy surroundingsfor then the interesting psychology of the quaint lovers would appear accentuatedlike the flame of a candleand would not be blurred by a pyrotechnic mass of startling coincidences and marvellous adventuresThe atmosphere of Doom that breathes throughout the story is reduced in the end to a sensational Eugène Sue like climax a heap

ostracize andhaving relegated him to his proper placeenjoy thoroughly or secretly or not at allwas Wedekind who first made people blush by a tasteless dissertation on the ignorant smugness recognized by society as the proper state for a young woman s mindHe called it Spring s AwakeningIt was chiefly instrumental in awakening theatrical writers and managersThey spread the blush at2 a head and waxed

nastinessThe argument is an endless oneIt leads to nothing except blows or blushesfor the plays I almost forgot I was reviewing them Wedekind explodes volcanically on the subject he treatsand blows the question mark out of womanHe takes all the crimes a policeman ever heard ofrolls them up in a package of soft warm flesh and labels itWoman He cracks his showman s whip and calls attention to the texture of her skin and the white meat of her bodyAnd then he sends her forth to ruinto sweep like a polluted and wreck strewn wave through lifebreaking at last in a dirty crest on a foreign shore and leaving a scum behind herAre these the worst things Wedekind could find to label woman incestbutcherylecherous animalismbloody business and abandonmentWho but a sick idealist would pick a careless and care free prostitute as a flaming example of woman at her worstAnd is the power to destroy the most terrible power woman possessesimagines that people idealize sex and hold it a beautiful forcePoor Wedekindwhere did he get such an ideaAnd then he imagines that in reality sex passion is a smashing force that knocks people into each other s armstumbles their heavenssmears their livesHe imagines that men and women love without thoughtmate with the irresponsibility of hyenasAnd imagining all this Wedekind creates a sort of droll fiend to prove itBehold her a creature to confound saints and

powerWere I in these plays I would as soon think of kissing Lulu as biting a stick of dynamiteBut I am not an ideal conceptionThere are other men Wedekind digs them up from every corner of life who

with a single human moral conviction merely for the sake of completing her diabolicallyIf only he had made it possible for her to sin against somethingBut she hasn t anything to sin against not a convictionnot a moralIn this country she would be tried for her murders and treasons and sent to an asylum for incomplete peopleWhat she does she does simplyWhen this hussy kills the father who owned her in order to save herself from his threats and then throws herself laughingly into the arms of the sonshe does it all without maliceIt is all naturalspontaneousWhen she rebukes her own father for making love to hershe tells him he s getting too old for such trickswhen she murdersdeceives and pollutes she hasn t any feeling of doing wrongany reaction except one of satisfactionIf this isn t an ideal I d like to know what isIf everybody was like she is there would be no sorrow or suffering in the worldWe would all be simple animals dashing aroundbiting each otherdrinking from each other s

exchange of notes was building up between the two governments and to re establish a genuine vehicle of communicationThe conversation may not lead to agreementbut at the top of a peculiarly forbidding

DecemberI have more than enjoyed each issue with your own impulsivewarm hearteddauntless personality coming through its pagesand it is for that reason I do not hesitate to ask you for an explanation of a sentence that you wrote in the April numberwhich led me to subscribe for that horrible outputviz The MassesYou pronounced it indispensable to intelligent livingOn that I sent in a subscriptionand whereas I am not so awfully stupid I cannot understand how youwho are evidently an artist with high idealscould possibly have such a magazine on your deskThe cartoons are so untrueso damnably vulgarwhich good art never isthe insistent harping on the shadows of lifethe exaggerated outlook which tinges the whole paper quite as one sided on its side as other papers are on theirs all of which I know must be in complete contradiction to your selfIt fills me with astonishmentW e acknowledge with our ever increasing complex civilization that we must more than ever perhaps help each otherbut I don t just understand which class this perfectly rotten sheet is intended to reachIf it s the so called down troddenthey are apt to have so much unhappiness any way 1 should say a good brace up does more good than harping on injustice in generalas for the class thatdoes not think its inartistic drawings alone would be enough to queer itWhen I am down and out I happen to be a working woman too I

The MassesIt is too trueIt is not got up for themThe Cosmopolitan is the ideal of the massThe Masses is for the few brave spirits who want to know life as it isthe shadows as well as the flights up into the sunshineThe Masses to my mind has as broad a range of feeling reflected in its pages as any magazine I know ofHumortragedylightshadedramacoloryesand mud tooas you sayBut isn t mud a part of lifeIn some respects mud is the condition of lifeThe great need of the sensitive mind of today is contact with the vital life giving things and ideas which come from the earthThe life of such a mind is like the life of a plantIts roots must go down beneath the surface or it will dieThe Masses to my mind is the spirit of the earth put into magazine formand to read it understandingly is to put the roots of the soul down into the earth where they should be if a healthy growth is desiredOne could get too much of that contact of coursebut that is another matterLittle ReviewPOETS vFREE VERSE

movement owes its origin to the large discovery ofPoetry as an art my italics He then proceeds to point out that the Imagist verse fails as poetry not because the writers love poetry lessbut because they love expression moreBeing what it is it would be no better if Tennyson had written itand no worse if it proved to be bysayMrRudyard KiplingIndeedit is not poetry any more than little Congreve s tiresome stream of depreciation is comedydespite what certain hopeless apprentice play critics assert to the contraryPoetryI supposée MrMonro would sayis not expression but the thing expressedAll this is good and trueBut MrMonro fails to make one thing quite clearThe Imagists have been mistaken in their very conception of poetry which lives alone by the power to see it as Art and not asan art I am convinced that some at least of the Imagists are not without the secret of this powerand if they will be guided by the vision they gain therebyto the extent of forgetting their literary eruditionit will transform their conception of poetryThe strict literature at which they aim is not proper poetryIn factliteary technicians do notas a rulewrite poetry for the simple reason that even if they dream the poet s dream of reality they at once proceed to smother it under literary formW e must look to those rich in poetical experienceand free to express itfor the true expression of poetryIn plain words Poetry as an art that isas expression or formis not the same as Poetry as Artthat isthe thing expressed The distinction is so big and vital and so necessary to be maintained at this
