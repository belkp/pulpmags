are really the finest I have ever tasted anywhere in the  World    THE LITTLE REVIEW POEMS by Jessie Dismorr Spring THE excessive sweetness of bird s singing pierces the thin epidermis of inattentive thought  Pale poison  it creeps along the channels of the nerves  thrills in the finger tips  becomes diffused in the blood  Because of it all appetite for appearances turns to nausea  the senses reject their diet of accustomed joys  Only essential seems that singular stabbing of edged notes  irregular  mercilessly unsubdued to music  The Enemy The microbe that inhabits my body makes me sick  but it is he that pushes me to impossible and exasperated feats of skill  He drinks my strength  then pushes me to unwilling exploration  Promenade With other delicate and malicious children  a horde bright eyed whose bodies easily tire  I follow Curiosity  the refined and maidenly governess of our adoration I am surprised to notice in an emerging thoroughfare Hunger  the vulgar usher  whipping up his tribe of schoolboys  who  questing hither and thither on robust limbs  fill the air with loud and innocent cries  The suspicion quickens within me that there is an understanding   We are being led by different ways into the same doubtful and prohibited neighborhood  4 The Little Review Islands In that restless sea which is eternity the little islands of event float among the waves   Are they water blossoms with roots continually shaken  floating their petals on the pulsating water  Are they a flotilla of frail boats trembling to the touches of interminable ripples   Even at flood time when from some ocean of inconceivable vastness the great tides pour into the brimming sea  the imperishable islands  fragile and obstinate  achieve their breathless equilibrium  Twilight Erect and of a curious emaciation the tall virgin paces the sands at nightfall  Around her limbs the wind twists her sinuous garments  the locks are whirled about her bossy temples  The treasure within her bosom is the finely selected material that fits into a little space  The talisman is discreet but absolute  She is immune from dissolution forever   Oh Sorrow  Oh Penalty  Life has eluded her contact   The pain that is her heart  the swiftness of her limbs  these are the last gift of civilization  But her arbitrary erectness is eternally menaced  Sea and sand and the bars of sinking cloud do not cease to urge her to the level of Nature s indiscriminate embrace  Landscape The immense gray sky  wheeling towards me and on to me  against it I have what resource  In the swarthy limbs of the trees that march over me as I lie pallid  holding to the earth  what danger Nevertheless a creature thus drugged and bound by immortality  am I not already destroyed by the rigorous onrush of time  The Little Review 5 S D  Having pricked the polished surfaces of life and defaced them and having dammed in thin close limits of expediency the perilous tides of affection she now for sole occupation cherishes a little pure flame  thin as a mist without heat    INTERIM by Dorothy Richardson Chapter Three COMING in at nine o clock on the day Sissie had had her first French lesson Miriam was quietly scuffing her muddy shoes on the mat in the gloom of the doorway with her eyes on the opposite gloom where beyond the glimmering gaslight about the hall table and the threatening dining room door the dim staircase beckoned up into darkness  when she was roused by the sound of a laugh coming from the far end of the passage  There was a line of bright light there  coming through the chink of the little door usually hidden in the darkness beyond where the Baileys disappeared down the basement stairs  Then there was a room there  The little door was pushed open and a man s figure stood outlined against the bright light and disappeared  shutting the door  There had been a table and a lamp upon it       the sound of the laugh rang in her head  a single lively deep chested note followed by a falsetto note that curved hysterically up  Men  gentlemen  How long had they been there  They would not stay  How had they come  Where had Mrs  Bailey found them  Had they already found out that it was not their sort of house  Who were they afraid of shocking with their refinement and freedom  They were making a bright little world in there by feeling themselves surrounded by people who would be shocked  They did not know there was someone there they could not shock       She imagined herself in the doorway       hullo  Fancy you here        The dining room door had opened and Mrs  Bailey was standing in the hall with the door open behind her  Miriam was not prepared with a refusal of the invitation to come in   She glanced over Mrs  Bailey s shoulder and saw the The Little Review two girls sitting at the fireside  Two letters on the hall table addressed to the Norwegian told her that the Baileys were alone  She yielded to Mrs  Bailey s delighted manner and went in  She would stay  keeping on her outdoor things  long enough to hear about the new people  The close sickly sweet air of the room closed oppressively round her heavy garments Here you are young lady sit here said Mrs  Bailey piloting her to a chair in front of the fire  There was a stranger sitting at the fireside Mr  Mendizzable murmured Mrs  Bailey as Miriam sat down  Miriam s affronted eyes took in the figure of a man sitting on the wooden stool between the lintel of the mantlepiece and the easy chair occupied by Sissie  a man from a café          a foreign waiter in his best clothes  sheeny stripy harsh pale grey  a crimson waistcoat showing up the gleam of a gold watch chain  and crimson cloth slippers  an Italian  a Frenchman  a French Swiss  He was sitting bent conversationally forward with his elbows on his knees and his hands clasped  quite at home  They had evidently been sitting there all the evening  The air about the fireplace was dense with their intercourse  Miriam received an abrupt nod in response to her murmur and her stiff bow and followed with resentful curiosity the little foreign tune the man began humming far away in his head  He had not even glanced her way and the tune was his response to Mrs  Bailey s introduction  The remains of a derisive smile seemed to snort from the firmly sweeping white nostrils above his tiny trim bushily upward curving black moustache  It moulded the strong closed lips and shone behind the whole of his curiously square evenly modelled face  The Bailey girls were watching him with shiny flushed cheeks and bright eyes  His skin was white and clean     mat  like felt     untouched and untried in the exhausted air of the shabby room  An insolent waiter  He had turned away towards the fire after his nod  From under a firm black lashed white lid a bright dark eye gazed derision into the flames  Go on Mr  Mendizzable smiled Mrs  Bailey brushing her skirt with her handkerchief we are most interested  Hay  madame that is all  he laughed derisively in rich singing swaying tones towards the middle of the hearthrug I skate from one end of their canal to another  faster than them all  I win their prize  Je m en fiche You skated all the way along the canal  Ieeea skate their canal  That was Amsterdam  I do many things there  I edit their newspaper  I conduct a café  I play in their theatre  The Little Review 7 You have had some adventures That was not adventures in Amsterdam mon dieu  he squealed musically  swaying from side to side  his thrust out face pointed       like Mephistopheles  He was like Mephistopheles  Had he really beaten those wonderful skaters  Perhaps he had not  She glanced at his brow calm  firm  dead white under the soft crisply ridged black hair  Perhaps he was Dutch  and that was why he looked common and also refined    Adventures I can tell you for a weekMts  sighed Mrs  Bailey  2  At ten o clock the youngest girl was sent to bed  Miriam scornfully watched herself miss her opportunity of getting away  She sat fascinated  resenting the interruption  enviously filching the gay outbreaking kindness that robbed the departure of humiliation and sent the child away counting on tomorrow  He went out of his way to make Polly Bailey happy        and sat on by the dying fire unwearied  freshly humming to himself towards the dingy hearth scattered thinly with sparse dusty ash  Mrs  Bailey returned  raked together the remains of the fire and settled herself in her chair with a shiver  In a moment she would begin her questionings and the voice would sound again  You cold mother darling  Come nearer the fire  Mrs  Bailey pulled her chair a few inches forward arching her neck and smiling her bright sweet smile Oogh  its parky upstairs Miriam implored herself to go parky reiterated Mrs  Bailey uncertainly  glancing daintily from side to side and smiling away a yawn behind her small rough reddened hand Parky  What is parky  Parky said Mrs  Bailey cold  like a park Ah  I see  That is good  When I go upstairs I go to Hyde Park      Ishall have in my bedroom a band  and a mass meeting  and a policeman  Salvation Army Band Miriam sat stiffly through the laughter of the Baileys  Her refusal to join brought the discomforting realization of having laughed  several times during the past hour  She had laughed in spite of herself  flinging her laughter out across the hearthrug towards the dying fire  leading the laughter of the Baileys  holding them off and herself apart  Now suddenly by refusing to share their laughter when they led the way she had openly separated herself from them  Then they knew she stayed on under a charm  They had witnessed her gathering  in the garden they themselves had provided  clusters of vivid things for memory   They 8 The Little  Review had seen her eagerness and her hunger and gratitude  It was the price  It stung and tried to humble her  She sat steadily on  flouting it  The grouping would not recur  Why did not Mrs  Bailey make him go on talking  A cold gloom spread sideways from the polished arch of the grate  encroaching on the corner where he sat drumming and humming  She drew her eyes with conscious absorption towards the dying fire  Its aspect was unendurably bleak  Her mind shrank from it  to meet the sense of the cold darkness waiting upstairs  Mrs  Bailey s voice bridged the emptiness  Some inner link was restored  Somewhere in her voice was something that rang restoringly round the world  The disconnected narrative was flowing again  The chilly hearth glowed with a small sombre brilliance        The foreign voice went on and on  narrative dialogue commentary  running flowing leaping in the voice that rang whatever its burden in bright sunshine  She listened openly  apologizing in swift affectionate glances for her stiff middle class resentment of his vulgar appearance  Was he vulgar  She tried in vain to recall her first impression  That curious blending of sturdy strength and polished refinement in the handsome head was like something wellknown in the head of a friend  She forced her friends to apologize and submit to the charm      3  It was nearly midnight  The grey of tomorrow morning kept pressing on her attention  She gathered herself together to go and rose reluctantly  The outer chill came down to meet her rising form  The glow of life was left there at the heart of the circle by the fire  The little man leapt up Hah  good night all and pushed past her and out of the room  Mrs  Bailey had made some remark towards her as she neared the door  She professed not to hear and went slowly on in the wake of the footsteps leaping up the dark flights  On the landing next below hers light blazed from a wideopen door  When she rounded the stairs a little melody sounded for an instant in a smooth swaying falsetto at the open door  As soon as she had passed the door was violently slammed      all those stories were true  And the first one about the skating  She imagined the white brow under a fur cap and the square short strong well knit form swaying strongly from side to side  on and on  ironically winning  The Little Review 9 4  Sissie read her set of phrases in heavy docility  Her will and the shapeless colourless voice murmuring from the back of her throat were given to the lesson  but the kindly sullen profile smouldered in slumber  Miriam pondered at ease  contrasting the two voices as they placed one after the other the little trite sentences upon the dreaming air  That Sissie should speak her French in the worst kind of English way did not really matter  But why was it  What did it mean  They all had something in common all the people who spoke French like that      a slender young man darted noiselessly into the room and began busily dusting the sideboard  He was wearing a striped cotton jacket  Mrs  Bailey had engaged a manservant     It was impossible  He would not be able to kept  It was like a play  He was like a character in a farce  rushing on and whisking things about  It was a play  amateur theatricals  Mrs  Bailey rushing radiantly about  stage managing  It was pretending things were different when they were not  breaking up the atmosphere of the house  Where did she get her ideas        Coming back to her surveillance she listened intently  Wait a minute  she said  we will begin all over again  I see exactly what it is  There s no difficulty  You can learn all about pronunciation in a few minutes  Sissie had started  Controlling herself she took her attention from the book long enough to give Miriam a sympathetic glancing smile  Let them ring in your head  into your nose and against your forehead  Sissie sat back smiling  and sat watching Miriam s face  It s we who speak through the nose  And mouth  In gusts  whoof  whoof  from the chest  all emptiness and no pronunciation  Sissie s eyes were roving intently about Miriam s face  They stop the breath at the lips and in the nose  Bong  That s through the nose  Bon  D you hear  like a little explosion  Hold the lips tight before the b and explode the word up into the nose partly closing the back of the throat and mouth  It s all like that and the pronunciation does not vary  When you know the few rules and get the vowels pure and explode the consonants  that s all there is  Sissie waited  controlling an apologetic smile  She had realised nothing but the violent outburst and was secretly laughing over the idea of explosions        Say matin  suggested Miriam patiently  Mattong  murmured Sisise  Say mattah  persisted Miriam  The youth came flourishing in with the coal box  That s right  Now try forcing the ah up into your nose and shutting your nose on it   It s time to lay the table Emyou  said Sissie reprovingly 10 The Little Review towards the hearthrug  Pliz  The young man reared a mild fair crested head above the rim of the table  Lay the table  tarb  paw dinnay snapped Sissie  I shall have to go Miss Henderson she added  getting gently up and ambling to the door  The young man shot murmuring from the room  They appeared to collide in the hall  Miriam found herself in the midst of a train of thought that had distracted her during her morning s work  Cosmopolic  she scribbled in her note book  The world of science and art is the true cosmopolic  Those were not the words in  Cosmopolis  but it was the idea  Perhaps no one had thought of it before the man who thought of having the magazine in three languages  It would be one of the new ideas  Tearing off the page she laid it on the sofa head and sat contemplating an imagined map of Europe with London  Paris and Berlin joined by a triangle  the globe rounding vaguely off on either side  All over the globe  dotted here and there were people who read and thought  making a network of unanimous culture  It was a tiring reflection  but it brought a comforting assurance that somewhere beyond the huddled hurrying confusion of everyday life something was being done quietly in a removed real world that led the other world  People arrived independently at the same conclusions in different languages and in the world of science they communicated with each other other  That made Cosmopolis  Yet it was an awful thought that the might gradually become all one piece  perhaps with one language  perhaps English if those people were right who talked about Anglo Saxon supremacy   England and  America together could rule the world   It sounded secure and comforting  like a police station  it would be wonderful to belong to the race whose language was spoken all over the world  All the foreigners would simply have to become English  But that idea brought a dreadful sense of loss  Foreigh languages had a beauty that could not be found in English  and the world would be ruled by the kind of English people who could never get the sound of a foreign word and who therefore had all sorts of appalling obliviousness  the kind of shouting prosperous English people it was a relief to get away from in Germany  The kind who said  I say  What   And who could only feel confident as long as someone else was in some way at a disadvantage   You write that miss   Yes  said Miriam leaping through surprise and indignation to delight  Sissie and Emile were back again in the room hurrying and angry  the little man bid them a loud good evening  a tablecloth The Little Review 11 was flountering out across the large table  Miriam returned to her note book  He was writing  with a scrap of pencil taken from his pocket  on her piece of paper  held against the wall  There miss he shouted gruffly  handing it to her   Lies she read  scribbled in a rounded hand across her words  and underneath there is NO Cosmopolis   Bernard Mendizabal   Oh yes  there is a cosmopolis  argued Miriam looking up and out from a confusion of convincing images  He was walking about in the window space in his extraordinary clothes  short and somehow too square for his clothes  making his clothes look square  His square roundly modelled head was changeably sculptured by the gaslight as he paced up and down  His distinction seemed to be sharpened by her words as she said vous avez tort monsieur  She had a sense of Emile and Sissie glancing and affronted while she slid down her sentence to leap  flouting them  forsaking her thrusting visions  and catch at any cost the joy of saying and hearing no matter what  in foreign speech  She would pay for the moment any price to make it sound and keep it sounding in the room  The spaces of her separate life in the house had become a background for this familiar forgotten joy so unexpectedly renewed   No miss   shouted Mr  Mendizabal  She cast a fierce general scowl towards his promenading figure  He was another of those foreigners who care for nothing in England but practising English  Then she would fight her theory   Je n ai pas tort  he thundered  standing before her with his hands in his pockets  He was taking her French for granted  In her thankfulness she sat docile before a torrent of words taking in nothing of their meaning  throwing out provisional phrases  according to his tone of question or assertion  The Baileys coming in and out of the room would see  an animated French conversation  and Sissie and Emile would forget her desperate onslaught in their admiration of the spectacle  The more she kept it glowing and emphatic and alive the further in their eyes she was redeemed  She gave no glance their way  Dinner must be almost ready  Soon she would have to go  The gong would tell her  Till then she could remain immersed in the tide of words  The little man was earnest and enraged  he used his French easily and fluently  It was not wonderful to him suddenly to become French  to feel the things he expressed change  become clear neat patterns  lose some of their meaning  fall open to attack  the pain of the failure of words so set out was made bearable by the wonder of the journey from speech to speech  He remained himself  apparently unaware of the change The Little Review of environment  or indifferent to it        En déche  what did that mean  Vous devez me voir en déche  You ought to see me en déche  That seemed to be his summing up  the basis of his denial of a cosmopolis  She attended  The only way he declared  as if recalling an earlier assertion  of proving the indifference of everyone to everyone else is to be en déche  Smiling comprehensively just before he turned on his heel and swung round  she drifted out of the room amidst the clangour of the gong     en déche       déchéance        somehow at a disadvantage  She thought her written phrases in French  They sounded a little grandiloquent  Someone seemed to be declaiming them from a platform  He probably had not realised what she was trying to say  But he was a cosmopolitan  he denied that there was any cosmopolis  any sympathy between races  even between individuals  He was a pessimist  With all his charm and zest he believed in nothing nobody  And he spoke from experience  Perhaps it was only in thoughts not in life that these things existed  People talked about cosmopolis because they wanted to believe it   Had he said that   Chapter  IV  After the first wonder of hearing an echo of a Queen s Hall Wagner night in Mrs  Bailey s dining room  Miriam forgot the music  Mr  Bowdoin had passed on from the overture to Tannhauser to unfamiliar fragments  unmelodious but haunted by suggested melody and with a curious flattened abrupt intimate message in their phrases  perhaps Russian  or Brahms  She could not listen to them here in the midst of the inattentive group sitting so closely round the piano  He had played the overture  imperfectly  but self forgetfully  in the foreign way  getting it  and rendering it  so that she had had sitting near the broken down piano  witnessing his difficulties and makeshifts  the whole orchestral impression from end to end and the hope that perhaps if Mr  Mendizabal stayed  he would come again  Perhaps the Baileys would ask him to come again  It would not occur to them  They were drowned in the occasion sitting like strangers in their own dining room  with the wonderful evening going on all round them  She consulted Sissie s expression  and probed enviously for the dark busy sulkily hidden thoughts going to and fro behind her attitude of sullen listening and painfully resented her opportunity of drawing pictures of Mr  Bowdoin s appearance and his movements at the piano  Passing swiftly to Mrs  Bailey she found her still in a tumult between her pride The Little Review 13 in the visitor and her circling contemplation of the things Mr  Mendizabal had told them  looking proudly at the slender shabby form and the back of the thatch of soft fine fair hair she saw the disorderly roomful of men slowly painting second rate posters  the sudden arrival of Mr  Mendizabal  their envious resentment of his quick clever work  the posters he thought of in the night and executed in the last hour before the office closed  Mir  Bowdoin forced by him to play a sonata on the typewriter with his hair in curl papers       perhaps she would be too distracted by these things to think of asking him to come again  Mr  Mendizabal lounging back in his chair with his hands in his pockets had a pleased proud wicked smile hovering about his face  He respected Bowdoin s playing  He respected music       He was showing him off  It was charming  like Trilby  Mr  Bowdoin had an English profile  a sort of blunted irregular aquiline  a little defaced about the mouth and chin by the influence on the muscles of his common way of speaking  But the back of his head was foreign  the outline of his skull fine and delicate  a delicate arch at the top and the back flattened a little under the soft fall of hair  He was stopping  He sat still  facing the piano  There were stirrings and murmurs and uncertain attempts at applause  Mr  Mendizabal rose and stood over him  as if to smite him on the shoulder  What do you think about when you play Beethoven  said Miriam hastily  His face came round and Mr  Mendizabal turned hilariously away to the room   By toven himself I think said Mr  Bowdoin quietly  If I get a Beethoven s Sonatas would you play one  I will play one for you  But not this evening I think He turned back to the piano and Miriam gazed at his indrawn profile  He was quite English and had all the English thoughts and feelings about the little group gathered behind him in the room  But there was something besides  He was a musician and that made him understand  He knew the room was impervious to music and was ill at ease after the first joy of playing  and could not convince his hearers by vitality and exuberance as a foreigner would do even with quite fragile subdued delicately controlled music  If you care about music he said towards the piano  will you come one evening and let me play to you on my own piano  I should like it more than anything said Miriam  quivering and clenching her clasped hands  It will be an honour and a great peasure to me if you will come he said in his quiet weary voice  I will take the liberty of writing to suggest an evening  Miriam s abrupt rising and blind movement left her standing opposite the lady help  who was stand 14 The_ Little Review ing with a foot on the fender and an elbow on the mantelpiece  on the other side of the hearthrug  After only two days in the house she seemed already more at home than the Baileys  talking derisively across at Mr  Mendizabal who was marching up and down the far side of the room with his hands in pockets shouting raillery and snorting  D you like London Miss Scott  said Miriam uncontrollably to her averted talking face  Miss Scott completed her sally  the Baileys were talking to Mr  Bowdoin  just behind  at the piano  Perhaps no one had witnessed her wild attack  But she could not take her eyes of Miss Scott s face  It turned towards her still wearing its derisive smile  What was that you said Miss Henderson I beg your pardon  she stated encouragingly  She was not in the least impressed by being spoken to  Her single swift glance flashed a glimmer of amusement  She seemed to be holding laughter in her throat  Her person was the centre of a barricade of derision  casting an immense shadow  Miriam repeated her question  fearfully consulting the small sheeny satin dress  with the lace collar  the neat slipper on the fender  the heavy little fringe stopping abruptly at the hollow temples above high cheekbones and slightly hollow cheeks and leading back to a tiny knot at the top of the head  Perhaps she was a lady  Ye see so little of it unless yerra wealthy  she said in curious tonguey guttural tones  standing upright on the hearthrug and flinging back her head with every other word as she backed away with a little balancing movement from foot to foot  She was Scotch  It was impossible to classify her  She laughed on her last word and stood shaking with laughter her elbow on the far corner of the mantelshelf and her foot once more on the fender  Perhaps she was still laughing at some jest of Mr  Mendizabal s  Arrya fond of London Miss Henderson  she chuckled and went on without waiting for an answer  with rhythmically flinging head  its ahl very well if ya can go out to theeaturras and consurruts and out and about  but when the season comes and the people are in the parruk and in thayre grand houses having parrties and gaities and yew ve just got to do nothing I think its draydefle  She laughed consumedly  throwing back her head  Miriam moved away  Everyone seemed to be talking  She escaped to the door  There was a letter from Eve in the hall  a thick one  In her cold room Miriam read that she would be surprised to hear that Eve had made  up her mind to give up governessing and learn to be a lady florist  She sat stupefied  It seemed impossible  terrifying  that Eve penniless  with her uncertain health should leave The Little Review the wealthy comfort of the Greens after all these years  Too excited to read word by word she scanned the pages and learned that Madame Leroy a friend of Mrs  Green who had a flower shop in Bruton Street had engaged her     I decorated the table for dinner each night when she was here at Christmas        the Greens have been charming  quite excited about the plans      the children       school       coming up next week       Miriam leapt to her feet and began hastily putting on her things   Eve is coming to London for a six months course in floral decorations  She is putting up at a hostel   She pulled on her cold sodden shoes   Eve is going to be an assistant in a flower shop at fifteen shillings a week  She has taken a cubicle at a branch of the Young Women s Bible Association   By the time she was ready she felt she must have dreamed the news  Eve  not a governess  free  in London  just as she was herself  Another self  in London  Eve being led about and taught London  going about under the same skies  in the same streets  feeling exactly as she felt  Nothing would have changed before she came  The rain gently thudding on the roof and rattling against the landing skylight was Eve s rain  She was listening to it and hearing it in exactly the same way       The girls did not realise the news at all  They kept going off into questions about details until the fact of Eve s coming disappeared altogether and only Eve s point of view and Eve s courage and her possible difficulties remained  One had told it the wrong way  Better not to have given any facts at all but just to have said Eve s coming to London  isn t it weird  But then they would have said is she coming to London to see the Queen  The Queen  That would have been true  She was coming to London partly to see the Queen  Perhaps the trouble was that they had been cheated by not being told exactly how Eve was only just managing to come at all and how slender everything would be  But at least they realised that one had people belonging to one who made up their minds and did definite things  like other people  It was amazing to decide to come to London and be a florist  like Napoleon  They realised that and nothing else  She would be able to tell Mr  Hancock on Monday  first him  first thing in the morning and the Orlys during the day  Mr  Hancock understood at once  making no response at all at first and then standing quietly about near her as she busied herself with her dusting really giving himself to taking in the simple stupendous fact  and really realising it before asking any questions and asking them in a tone that showed he knew what 16 The Little Review it meant and going on showing all day in his manner that he knew what it was that kept her so joyously brisk about her work  He was divine  he was a divine person  She would never forget being able to say just anyhow  h m  I ve got a sister coming to London  and his immediate silent approach across the room  drying his hands  Of course the Orlys immediately said Oh how nice for you  you won t be so lonely  What did people mean about loneliness  It was always the people arranged in groups and seeming so lost and isolated and lonely who said that      Everyone in London had been told  There would be the Wilsons to write to about it and the Brooms to tell  That could wait  To night she would begin turning out her room for Eve s reception  No  It was the Dante lecture      The day Eve came she would buy some flowers  She understood now why people wanted to put flowers in their rooms when people were coming  She would be a hostess for the first time  Some people bought flowers and carried them home when they were alone      It must be like inviting a guest to keep you company  Like saying you were alone and not liking being alone and putting flowers about to tell you all the time that you did not want to be alone but were  People talked about these things   I always buy flowers when I am alone   Like suddenly taking off all their things and showing that they had a crooked spine  If they were really miserable about being alone they would be too miserable to buy flowers  If they really wanted the flowers enough to buy them they were already not alone  If they bought the flowers in that fussy excited thoughtless way people seemed to do things they were neither really ever alone or ever really with people        they were in that sort of state that made social life a talkative nothingness sliding about on nothing       At the end of the afternoon she wandered forgetfully into the warmth of the empty waiting room  The house was silent  Her footsteps made no sound along the carpeted hall and were lost in the thick turkey carpeting of the waiting room floor  The room was lit only by the firelight  From its wide clear core striped by black bars a broad rose gold shaft glowed out across the room reaching the copper vessels on the black oak sideboard in line with the door and the lower part of the long mirror between the windows where the midmost piece of copper gleamed again in reflection  She stood still  holding the warm air in her nostrils  everything on a sudden blotted out and restored to its place       what place  why was it good  what was she trying to remember        In the familiar fire lit winter darkness amidst the secret familiar The Little Review  _17 glow of copper on dark oak was faint dry warm scent       mimosa   It was a repetition       It had been there last year  suddenly  drily fragrant in the winter darkness of the warm room preparing for the light and warmth of the evening   It had seemed then like some wealthy extravagance  sudden and rootless  bringing a sense of the freedom of wealth to have things out of season and a keen sudden memory in the dark London room of the unspoken inexpressible beauty of Newlands      its whole soft toned softly carpeted and curtained effect fragrant with clusters of winter flowers  stealing secretly forward with her in her life  standing complete somewhere in the secret black spaces of her mind       But now here it was again  just at the same moment  just before the winter darkness began to give way  Perhaps mimosa came at this time of year suddenly in the shops  before the spring flowers and careful people like Mrs  Orly could buy it        then in London mimosa was the sign of spring   It was like the powdery fragrance of a clear warm midsummer evening  like petal dust  like pollen dust  the whole summer circling in the glow of firelight   Then Eve would not come this winter   The darkest secret winter time of London was over again   It would come again in single moments and groups of days  but its time Was gone  The moment of keenest realisation of spring had come by surprise  there lay all the spring days ahead leading on to summer spread out for anyone to see  calling to Eve or to anyone who might have come into the room and to whom one could have said doesn t the smell of mimosa make you realise the winter is over  and here  within  lit up as if by a suddenly switched on electric light was one s own best realisation  going back and back  pictures that grew richer and clearer  each time something happened that switched on a light within the black spaces of your mind  Things that no one could share  coming again and again just as some outside thing was beginning to interest you  as if to remind you that the inmost reality can be shared only with yourself   The prospect of Eve s coming was changed   The pang of the mimosa came nearer than anything she could bring   Perhaps it would be possible to tell her about this moment   Perhaps her coming had made it more real  Yet now it did not seem to matter so much whether she came or not   In a way it seemed as though the fact of her coming threatened something  2  A note  brought by hand  scrawling rounded formally re18 The Little Review served handwriting covering nearly the whole of the envelope  filling the hall table  bringing disturbance into the crowded evening  She read it hurrying to the station   Mr  Bowdoin  She had forgotten him        The note did not bring any renewal of the hours of music  Its request in formal courtly old fashioned phrases for her fulfilment of her undertaking put the enterprise amongst those social occasions  offering only dread in anticipation  and to be lived through like a scene from a play in which she had in a moment of confidence risked being asked to take part  The  few friends  had been gathered expressly that she might go and hear him play  She would have to sit  conscious of this  not really hearing him  and afterwards find something to say  An Englishman  solemn and polite playing foreign music  with English friends politely and solemnly sitting round  There was no word of Mr  Mendizabal  He was not going  If he had been Mr  Bowdoin would not have said I will call at six thirty for the purpose of escorting you to my rooms  He was like a goaler  Perhaps the walk would be an opportunity of getting over nervousness  There would be music at once  no meal to get through  She would thank him very much for the great treat and when it was over there would only be Eve and the accomplishment of having heard a good piano played by a musician  He could be dropped        He could be asked to come just once and play for Eve  That would be a great London evening for her  The sense of a complex London life crowded with engagements made her pace in spite of her weariness up and down the platform at Gower Street station  Its familiar sulphurous gloom  the platform lights shining murkily from the midst of slowly rolling clouds of grey smoke  the dark forms and phantom white faces of waiting passengers emerging suddenly as she threaded the darkness revived her  By the time the train rolled slowly in behind its beloved black dumpy high shoufdered engine with its large unshrieking mushroom bell whistle the journey had changed from its first character of an expedition to a spot within five minutes walk of Sarah s unconfessed to Sarah  and had become a journey on the Metropolitan  going indeed outside the radius into blackness  but going so far only because the Dante lecture  wandered out of London was waiting there  and to be repeated at the end of the evening safely returning through increasing gloom until the climax of Gower Street was reached again  She reached the little hall in the suburban road in good time and sat in a forward row staring at the little platform where presently the educative voice would be standing   She was con The Little Review 19 scious of a stirring and buzzing all about her that had been absent in the London hall  The first series of lectures had not brought any sense of an audience  Here  the many audible centres of culture  the eager discussions and sullen incisive remarks  the triumphant intensity on the faces of some of the women caught as she glanced now and then fearfully about  the curious happy briskness of the men  had her feel that the lecturer was superfluous  All these people were the cultured refined kind who did not trouble much about their clothes  There were no furs to be seen  the women wore large rather ugly coats or ulsters or capes and bashed muddly looking hats and had mufflers or long scarves  In the London audience herself and her clothes had been invisible  here they were just right  a sort of hall mark  In her black dress with her clumsy golf cape thrown back from her shoulders  her weather worn felt hat softened perhaps to harmony with her head in the soft light she could perhaps pass for a cultured person  Bianchi and Neri whispered her neighbour eagerly in the midst of a long sentence addressed to a girl at her side  She was an Englishwoman  But her mind was so at home in the middle ages that she spoke the names and used the Italian pronunciation without a touch of pedantry  and as eagerly and interestly as anyone else might say  they re engaged   The clergyman in the row in front would drawl out the words with an unctuous suggestion of superior knowledge  He would use them to crush someone  Most of the men present Were a little like that  using their knowledge like a code or a weapon  But the women were really interested in it  they were like people who had climbed a hill and were eagerly intent on what they could see on the other side  It was refreshing and also in some way comforting to be with them  They represented something in life that was going to increase  Perhaps it would increase too much  they seemed so headlong and unaware of anything else  Did she want a world made up of women like this  If she spoke to them they would assume she was one of themselves and look busily at her with unseeing eyes  fixed only on all the other things they thought about  until they perceived that she was a fraud  Long intercourse with these might make her able to talk as they did  but never to think in the way they did  Never to have the extraordinary busy assured appearance presented by their persons when you could not see their eager faces  a look that made them seem to be going very fast in some direction that completely satisfied them  so that if a fire broke out behind them suddenly they would regard it not as an adventure that might have been expected 20 The Little Review but as an annoying interruption  like tripping over a stone       She could see that when he read the sonnets he forgot how learned he was  The little lecture had had its own fascination  But it was a lecture  something told by a specialist to an audience  This was Dante s voice  and they all listened as they could  the lecturer as well  All his knowledge was put aside and he listened as he read  She sat listening  her shocked mind still condemning her for not having discovered for herself that it was wrong to have a post office savings account  and that betting and gambling and lotteries were wrong because they produced nothing  For a time she flashed about with the searchlight of the new definition of vice     money can t produce money        then all trade was wrong in some way      dissipation of value without production        there was some principle that all civilisation was breaking        how did this man know that it was wrong to imagine affection if there was no affection in your life  that dreaming and brooding was a sort of beastliness      love was actual and practical  moving all the spheres and informing the mind  That was true  That was the truth about everything  But who could attain to it  Dante knew it because he loved Beatrice  How could humanity become more loving  How could social life come to be founded on love  How can I become more loving  I do not know or love anyone but myself      it did not mean being loved  It was not anything to do with marriage  Dante only saw Beatrice  But this is the awful truth  however one may sit as if one were not condemned and forget again  This is the difficult thing that everyone has to do  Not dogmas  This man believes that there is a God who loves and demands that men shall be loving  That is what will be asked  That is the judgment  It is true because it breaks into you and condemns you  Everything else is distraction and evasion  The humble yearning devotion in the voice reading the lines made it a  prayer  the very voice a prayer to a spirit waiting all round  present in himsef  in everyone listening  in the very atmosphere  It was there  to be had  It was like something left far behind one on a dark road and still there  to be had for the asking  to be had by merely turning towards it      She looked into the eyes of Dante across the centuries as into the eyes of a friend  But then these people were the same  It was the truth about everybody  the struggling goodwill in all of us       She travelled back towards London in a dream  Her compartment was empty  All the people in the world  full of goodwill without troubling or even thinking about it were away somewhere The Little Review 21 else  Just as she had learned what people were there was nobody  There was no love in her nature  If there were any she would not have been sitting here alone  If a man love not his brother whom he hath seen how shall he love God whom he hath not seen  There was a catch in that like a riddle   Heads I win tails you lose      If you keep that quiet and gentle  asking for nothing  not being anything  not holding on to anything in your life  nor thinking about anything in your life there is something there      behind you       that must be God the way to Christ  the edge of the way to Christ    Keeping quiet and  coming to  that  you  feel  what   you  are  and  that  you  have never begun being anything but your evil natural self   You feel thick with evil      oh      that was prayer  One could become more loving   It is answered at once   Just turning towards that something in a desire to be different begins to change you   At Praed Street the carriage began to fill with seated forms   This was the beginning of new life         Keeping perfectly still and looking at no one she realised the presence of her fellow travellers  all just like herself  living from within by the contact with the edge of Christ      all knowing the thing that to her was only a little flicker just dawning in a long life of evil   It made them kindly in the world and able to understand each other   Perhaps it was the explanation of all the fussing   Everyone in the world was bathed in the light and love except herself       It was not certain that a whole lifetime of prayer and gentleness and self control would destroy enough of the thick roots of evil in her to bring her through into the Paradiso      But if prayer  just the turning away from all one knew begging to be destroyed and made loving brought such an immediate sense of the evil in oneself and the good in everyone else  there was no end to what it might do  Prayer was the work to do in her life  nothing else   But the turning to the unseen God of love and giving up one s self will meant being changed in a way one could not control or foresee  dropping everything one had and cherished secretly and having things only in common with other people   It would mean going forward with nothing into an unknown world  always being agree  ble   and agreeing   I love all these people she murmured in her mind and felt a glow that seemed to radiate out to all the corners of the compartment   It s true   This is life   This is the only way in  It may be that I am so bad that I can only sit with all my evil visible silent amongst humanity for the rest of my life  learn  ing to love them  and then die out completely because I am too 22 The Little Review bad to be quite new born      her eyes were drawn towards the face of the woman sitting opposite to her  a shapeless body  a thin ravaged face strained and sheeny with fatigue and wearing an expression of undaunted sweetness and patience  Children and housework and a selfish husband and nothing in life of her own  She was at the disposal of everyone for kind actions  She would be really sympathetic and shocked about an earthquake in China  Was that it  Was that being inside  Was that all there was  She did not see the wonderful gold brown light in the carriage  nor the beauty of the blackness outside  In her brain was the pain and pressure of everything she had to do  She was good and sweet  perfectly good and sweet  But there was something irritating about her        her obliviousness of everything but  troubles   other people s as much as her own  Yet she would love a day in country  The fields and the flowers would make her cry  It washer obliviousness that made one afraid of associating with her  Being in conversation with her or in any way associated with her life there would always be the dreadful imprisoned feeling of knowing she did not think        Her glance slid over the other seated forms and fell  leaving her struggling between her desire to feel in loving union with them and her inability to ignore the revelations pouring from their bearing and shapes  their clothes and the way they held their belongings  They were terrible and hateful because all their thoughts were visible  The terrible maddening thing about them was the thoughts they did not think  It made them worse than the woman because to get on with them one would have to pretend to see life as they saw it  It would be so easy and deceitful with each one alone  knowing exactly what line to take  She wrenched herself back to her prayer        instantly the thought came that all these people far away in themselves wanted to be more loving  She drew herself together and sat up staring out towards the darkness  That was an answer to prayer  A state of mind that came from the state of prayer  But then one would need always to be in a state of prayer  It would be very difficult it would be almost impossible even to remember it in the rush of life     it would mean being a sort of fool      having no judgments or opinioins  It would spoil everyhting  There would be no time for anything  Nothing beyond one s daily work and all the rest of the time being all things to all men  It meant that now at this moment one must give up the sense of the train going along in the darkness and the sense of the dark streets waiting lamplit under The  Little  Review 23 the dark sky and go out to the people in the carriage and thenon to the people at Tansley Street     she thought of people she knew who did this  appearing to see nothing in life but people and recoiled  Places to them were nothing but people  there was something they missed out that could not be given up  Something goes if you lose yourself in humanity  You cannot find humanity by looking for God only there  Making up your mind that God is to be found in humanity is humanism      It was Comte s idea  Perhaps Unitarians are all Comtists  That is why they dress without style  They are more interested in social reform than the astoundingness of there being people anywhere  But to see God everywhere is pantheism  What is Christianity  Where are Christians  Evangelicals are humanitarians  rushing about in ulsters  Anglicans know all about the beauty of life and like comfort  But they are snobs and afraid of new ideas        convents and monasteries stop your mind  But there is a God or a Christ  there is something always there to answer when you turn away to it from everything  Perhaps one would have to remain silent  for years  for a lifetime  and in the end begin to understand  3  At Gower Street it was eleven o clock  She was faint with hunger  She had had no dinner and there was nothing in her room  She wandered along the Euston Road hoping to meet a potato man  The shopfronts were black  There was nothing to meet her need but the empty stretch of lamplit pavement leading on and on        Rapid walking in the rain freshened air relieved her faintness but she dreaded waking in the night with gnawing hunger to keep her awake and drag her up exhausted in the morning  A faint square of brighter light on the pavement ahead came like an accusation  Passing swiftly across it she glanced bitterly at the frosted door through which it came  Restaurant  Donizetti Brothers  The whole world had conspired to leave her alone with that mystery shut in and hidden everyday the whole of her London time behind its closed frosted doors and forcing her now to admit that there was food there and she must go in or have the knowledge of being starved through fear  Her thoughts flashed painfully across a frosted door long ago in Baker Street and she saw the angry handsome face of the waiter who had shouted roll and butter and whisked away from the table the twisted cone of serviette and the knives and forks  That was in the middle of the day  It would be worse at night  Perhaps they would even refuse 24 The Little Review to serve her  Perhaps it was impossible to go into a restaurant late at night alone  She was coming back  There was nothing to be seen behind the steamy panes on either side of the door but plants standing on oil cloth mats  Behind them was again frosted glass  It was not so grand as Baker Street  There was no menu in a large brass frame with Schweppe s at the top  She pushed open the glass door in angry hatred and was confronted by another glass door blankly frosted all over  Why were they so secret  Inside the second door she found herself at the beginning of a long aisle of linoleum  On either side people were dotted here and there on short velvet sofa seats behind marble topped tables  In the close air there was a strong smell made up of all kinds of meat dishes  A waiter flicking the crumbs from a table glanced sharply round at her and went off down the room  He had seen the shifts and miseries that haunted all her doings  They were apparent in the very hang of her cloak  She could not first swing down the restaurant making it wave for joy as it did when she walked across Trafalgar Square in the dark and then order a roll and butter  After this it would never wave for joy again  A short compact bald man in a white apron was hurrying down the aisle  towards her  He stopped just in front of her and stood bowing and in  dicating a near empty table with his short arm and stood silently hovering while she dragged herself into place on the velvet sofa  The waiter rushing up with a menu was gently waved away and the little man stood over the side of the table blocking out the fuller end of the restaurant  Hardly able to speak for the beating of her heart she looked up into a little firm round pallid face with a small snub nose and curious pale waxy blue eyes and said furiously oh please just a roll and butter and a cup of cocoa  The little man bowed low with a beaming face and went gently away  Miriam watched him go down the aisle bowing here and there right and left  The hovering waiter came forward questioningly to meet him and was again waved aside and she presently saw the little man at a speaking tube and heard him sing in a chalky high monotone  Un cho co lat  He brought her things and arranged them carefully about her and brought her an Illustrated London News from another table  She sipped and munched and looked at all the pictures  The people in the pictures were real people  She imagined them moving and talking in all manner of circumstances and suffered their characteristics gently  feeling as if some one were there gently half reproachfully holding her hands tied behind her back   The waiter roamed up and down the aisle   People The Little Review 25 came in  sometimes two or three at a time  The little man was sitting writing with a stern bent face at a little table at the far end of the restaurant just in front of a marble counter holding huge urnsand glass dishes piled with buns and slices of cake  He did not move again until she rose to go when he came once more hurrying down the aisle  Her bill was sixpence and he took the coin with a bow and waited while she extricated herself from the clinging velvet and held the door wide for her to pass out  Good evening thank you very much she murmured hoping that he heard  in response to his polite farewell  She wandered slowly home through the drizzling rain warmed and fed with a glowing heart  Inside those frightful frosted doors was a home  a bit of her own London home bought with terrors  All the way home the little scene kept playing itself through her mind  4  The hall gas was out  The dining room door was ajar showing a faint light and light was coming from the little room at the end of the passage  Miriam cautiously pushed open the dining room door  Mrs  Bailey was sitting alone poised socially in a low armchair by the fire with the gas turned low  Miriam came dutifully forward in response to the entrancement of her smile and stood on the hearthrug enwrapped in her evening  played over by the sense of beginning it anew with Mrs  Bailey  When had she seen Mrs  Bailey last  She could tell her now about Eve in great confidential detail and explain that she could not at present afford to come to Tansley Street  That would be a great sociable conversation and the engagement with Mr  Bowdoin would remain untouched  She stood in a glow of eloquence  Mrs  Bailey preened and bridled and made little cheerful affectionate remarks and waited silent a moment before asking if it rained  Miriam forgot Eve and gathered herself together for some tremendous communi  cation  Was it raining  She glanced at the outside London world and was lost in interchanging scenes  her mind split up  pressing several ways at once  Mrs  Bailey saw all these scenes and felt and understood them exactly as she did  There was no need to answer the question  She glanced stonily towards her and saw the downcast held in embarrassment of her waiting form  In a dry professional official voice she said gazing at the hearthrug with an air of judicial profundity  no  at least oh yes  I think it is raining and drifted helplessly towards the window  The challenge was be  26 The Little Review hind her  She would have to face it again  A borrowed voice said briskly within her yes its pouring  I hope it will be fine tomorrow  what weather we have had  well goodnight Mrs  Bailey  I have been to a lecture  she said in imagination to Mrs  Bailey  standing by the window  It was what any other boarder would have said and then so fine  such a splendid lecturer and told the subject and his name and one idea out of the lecture and they would have agreed and gone cheerfully to bed  with no thoughts  To try and really tell anything about the lecture would be to plunge down into misrepresentations and misunderstandings and end with the lecture vanished  To say anything real about it would lead to living the rest of her life with the Baileys helping them with their plans      she turned and came busily back  It s very late she murmured  Mrs  Bailey smiled and yawned  At least not so very late  not quite tomorrow  she pursued turning round to the clock and back again to consult the pictures and the wall paper  Just staying there was answering Mrs  Bailey s question  Suddenly she laughed out and turned  laughing  as if she were about to communicate some mirthful memory  It s too absurd she said distracted between the joy of her lingering laughter and the need for instantly inventing an explanation  Mrs  Bailey was laughing delightfully  There was a most absurd thing chanted Miriam above her laughter  a gentle tap took Mrs  Bailey scurrying to the door  May I have a candle Mrs  Bailey murmured a low voice in a curious solidly curv  ing intonation  Certainly doctor answered Mrs  Bailey s voice in the hall  She scurried away downstairs  Miriam turned towards the window and stood listening to St  Pancras clock striking mid  night  Then those men in the little back sitting room were doctors  How pleased and proud Mrs  Bailey must be and how wonderful of her to say nothing about them  Can I have a candle missuz Bailey  Wrapped away in the suave strong courteous voice were the knowledge and the fineness of a world no one in the house knew anything about  Mrs  Bailey dimly knew  and screened it fearing to lose it  She had the wonderful voice all to herself   Good evening    The voice was in the room  Miriam turned instantly  a square strong looking man a little over middle height with flat pale fair hair smooth on a squarish head above grave bluntly moulded features was moving easily forward from the door  They met at the end of the table standing one each side the angle of the fireside corner  smiling as if her murmured response to his greeting had been a speech in a play ready made to bring them together   Miriam felt that if she had said oh I m so glad he The Little Review would have responded yes  so am I  My name s von Heber he announced quietly  his restraind uncontrollably deepening smile send ing out a radiance all round her  It was as if they had met before without the opportunity of speaking and here at last was the opportunity and they had first to smile out their recognition of its perfection  They stood in a radiant silence  his even tones making no break in their interchange  She felt a quality in him she had not met before  in the ease of his manner there was no trace of the complacent assumption of the man of the world  His deference was no mask worn to decorate himself  It was deliberate and yet genuine  It was the shape in which he presented to her  personally  set above and away from her ugly clothes and her weariness  the gust of delight which had been his inward greeting  The completeness and confidence of his delight his own completeness and security revealed to her  a joyous reading of life that she longed to hold and fathom  She proferred in return as a measure of her qualification the laughter she had laughed to Mrs  Bailey  hoping he had heard it  I find this custom of putting down the light at eleven very inconvenient he was saying  Miriam smiled and listened eagerly for more of the low  even  curiously curving intonations  I propose to take the London medical examination in July and I ve a good deal of hard work to get through prior to that date  He had not been going to stop speaking but Miriam found an immense welcoming space for the word she summoned in vain desperately from far away Wimpole Street  The conjoint she declared at last eagerly  almost before the word reached her consciousness  The Conjoint he repeated and as his voice went on Miriam contemplated the accumulation they had gathered  She felt as if they were talking backwards  towards something already said and when he had said I m taking the post graduate course at your great hospital near here  she tried in vain to resist the temptation of leading their talk down into detail  The way to preserve the charm unbroken would be to let him go on talking  She might learn more about the post graduate course and find out what it meant and what part of the London medical world it was  the whole of the London medical world was being transformed by this man into something simple and joyful  But the eager words had escaped her oh  that s the one with the glorious yarn Tell me the yarn he chuckled gently  showing a row of strong squarish brilliant teeth  Well  she said the big surgeons were operating and the patient was collapsing and one said I think it is time we called in Divine aid   Nonsense said the other I don t believe in The Ltttle Review unqualified assistants  That s great he declared  that s one of the greatest yarns I ve heard  I shan t forget it  He was not shocked and she had told the story as evenly and as much without emphasis as he would have done himself  She suddenly realised that this was the way to say things  It made no pause and did not disturb anything  She was learning from him every moment  He was utterly different to the men she knew  He did not resent her possession of the story nor attempt to cap it  You ve got some very great men over here he said  some of the very greatest  When Mrs  Bailey came up at half past twelve he accepted his candle and thanked her gravely and gravely took his leave  When the door of the little back room had closed Miriam confronted Mrs  Bailey again  They stood smiling at each other  Well we must go to bed said Miriam at last  Mrs  Bailey turned out the gas with a laugh  They moved into the hall and hurried off laughing in opposite directions  Mrs  Bailey trotted down the basement stairs humming a tune  Your Barker and your Horsley mused Miriam slackening her speed on the stairs  The sound of the low quiet glad confident voice steadying the aspect of the world and a strange new sense of the London medical world dotted by men who were world famous approached from afar  reverently  for specialist training  by already qualified medical men  competed to  gether within her as she prepared for bed  going serenely through all the tiresome little processes  Something in the centre of life had steadied and clarified  It sent a radiance like sunlight through all the endless processes of things  even a ragged tooth brush was a part of the sunlit scene  not unnoticed  or just dismal and threat  ening  but a part of the sunlit scene   to be continued  A SENTIMENTAL SCHEME by Emanuel Carnevali SHE is a sweet  It s the man who is ferocious and a savage  poor sad man  they didn t give him any motherly care at all  But she s a sweet  He wants to drag her  ferociously  into his cave you must excuse him  he wants to make a statue of Death and there is no other model  there was no other model when the open sun had burnt out or scorched or melted all the other girls  But she went around on a morning and having found a simplified little flower she sat down by it and she s smiling still  sitting down by the flower  Flowers and chips of sunlight and grey pebbles shame the furious will to do of the man  so he hides his head in the day and at night only he lifts a frowning face to the stars  Poor boy  he loved the stars and they deceived him  and as he loves them still he frowns at them in the night and shrieks  Flirts   He shrieks  but his heart is as lonely as a leafless tree standing companionless over the shroud of the dunes  Now the time has come for the last fight  He has the good chance of seeing a darkness in the eyes of her and from that darkness images of death arose before the hungry hands of the man  That s the only reason he is still after her  Once she stood  shamefully naked  before the cave of the man and sang  I shall laugh until your heart be a dark accompaniment to the shrill and thin music of my teeth   Then I ll go  then I ll go away  I m shaking this bouquet  I m shaking don t you see  this bouquet  to make you come out of there  Then you can have the bouquet  spoiled for your sake  and I ll go gather other and more flowers  30 The Little Review I ll make a kid of you  you ll follow me  Follow  follow  in the cortege of the Fairy Queen whom children follow  But the time for Fairy Queens was shut in the graves of books  so the man smiled pleasantly  And he smiled well  Because he knew no Fairy Queen to have ever had legs as beautiful as the old whore Death  He was proud of his love  his unrequited love  and he was waiting for his love  His old love would come and lie down by him and say not a word  his old love would be a rock to echo his last word  that is what he thought  He thought so  and he waited  his last word gripped within the fist of his dry heart  smiling  It takes indeed a strong man to smile in such circumstances  and the girl knew she was beaten at her own game  ADVICE TO A BUTTER CUP by Maxwell Bodenheim Undistinguished butter cup Lost among myriads of others  To the red ant eyeing you You are giant stillness  He pauses on the boulder of a clod  Baffled by your nearness to the sky  But to the black loam at your feet You are the atom of a pent up dream  Undistinguished butter cup  Draw your lone breath of contemplation Undisturbed by haughty tricks of space  Form is but a loftily clownish gown Upon the limbs of stillness  The Little Review 31 GOD BLESS THE BOTTLE by John Rodker A REMOTE and hitherto untouched aspect of man is his relation to the bottle as vehicle  The philosopher  engaged in an instinctive process of denigrating his fellows  begins to see man as a more than laborious ant appurtenance of an indubitable egg  occasion for sudden alarms and heroisms  Story has it that ringed by fire instinctive processes madden him  make him swallow his burden  knowing that still it will persist in the heart of the race  The unexpected oblation fills him with strange intoxication  Whether the brain grew spongier or sudden contractions exuded new and never before envisaged possibilities is the problem set before us  Nevertheless there would seem to be no occasion of life without its bottle  In at the front door  out at the back  life itself could not be more simple  These bottles are of as many species as they who minister  relieving them of the burden of a self sufficient existence  From the expansible djinn of a carboy to the drawf  atom moulded to bottle shape for the dolls  service  they range with an equal relative density  the thousandfold refined essences of science attain to an homeopathic dose  To all these man   responds  This test of man as G  C  M  should once and for all prove his adaptability placing him anywhere in an infinite descending and ascending series  Des Esseintes has never been that exotic the 90 s found him  for all men are his peers  As a detonator for the dramatic that jigger embedded by a benign providence so close under the skin of strong and weak the bottle is of course without parallel  The little heart begins pumping  the moderately large blood streams race  the little brain flops all over the place  a corner begins to chatter like the whirring of a dynamo  One is flung off at a tangent plotted equidistant to time and space with geometrically increasing velocity  This you will admit is considerably more to the point than all the bombs improvised out of empty bottle  powder and rusty nails  and the mode of ingestion is by so much the more dignified  The analogy is that of a water mattress  What was empty swells  assumes the vertical  rigidity  even gives itself airs  is no longer the creature of circumstance  It has become rock like in comparison  Why in  troduce a brain which now assumes merely its real and eternal function of emanation   That is so much to the good  32 The Little Review Divagations in the manner of the Purple Pileus need not de  tain us  but half a dozen bottles passed out of the back door with a hollow gurgle of the belly is more dispiriting than any carcase   for here was that indubitable afflatus which makes man so rare a creature  just as the completeness of its lack makes man more vegetable than phanerogams  more salt than a mineral  And there are certain human essences Science would do well to bottle   Musk is not so far removed as certain flower essences  I have met people whose essences attain vast proportions in rooms  themselves as tight as any spider in the centre web deployed around them  POEMS by Mark Turbyfill A Young Man  Talking About  a Woman  To J  S   I SHE is touched with a beauty the sere of reeds by an old water  Her being is of a duality  the idea that waits unconquered  in and beyond a vast ice  of the fine sharp green which wakes in young shoots at the base of trees she is impelled  and given motive  Slowly we have walked together  knowing the meaning of earth  and small twigs  II I am the surprised young man  light walker on night lawns  My mind is the mould into which has fallen the beauty of things  Pour into me your metal  your tears  and phases in queer places  and I will give them back to you in little shining shapes and patterns  The Little Review 33 III She is a woman older  and more wise than I  Her mind is the channel without form  through which beauty has raged  Through her no kindling thought has crytalized in jewel or phrase  Yet I can not say that the storm has eluded  or defied her  for she is of the storm  IV Our moments have tangled themselves in odd rhythms  and in resolving cadences we have spent our days  How many hours have we dreamed to the curve of this or that song  How many dreams woven in the color of a red persimmon moon  When shall we have unravelled the strange cadence of love as we have known it          V As for me  the months have brought no added wisdom   I have suffered the malady of becoming mature   Already resignation willingness a little mellow comes subtly  secretly  working its ravages        A little wearing away  and a little wearing down        Will the sense of form endure  VI She is wise but unfettered with wisdom   Somewhere white violets are springing large and single on a hill  I should like to find a sort that grow stark amid ice   Somewhere in her consciousness repose the isolated virtues of duality  Violets and daisies there do not together bring forth the hya  cinth  but each is each  single  shape for shape  and primitive  34 The Little Review Fragment of Vision  To J  S   Creation is the thought of spring  Loveliness falling  Calling a semi circle of action To respond in completion  Flowers ascending through rain  The texture of your mind And the flavor of your consciousness Intact remain  We walked in a broad space And to us it was revealed  that Afted the rainbow fades  After the fringe of rain  After cloud shapes vanish  Their imprint clings forever  It was not the stripped plane of land  Nor the stretch of sea beyond  Nor the sting of lime from sand and shell That fell on everything  Not the fierce unheeded sweep Of two convergent figures Meeting by chance against the sky  These physical things Have shifted now to other springs  Only the untouched forms of daisies Resist translation to changing phases     THE LITTLE REVIEW Editor  Margaret Anderson Foreign Editors  John Rodker Jules Romains Advisory Board  DISCUSSION Aldington s  Images  of  Desire by Mary Butts THE images of Mr  Richard Adlington s desire shows the perception that the chief value of love is not the loved one but the unique state of being  the sense of power she evokes in us  Women put on hats and gowns with trains  men create theologies and the ritual of games to the same end  the extension of personality  and to enjoy the series of states from well being to ecstasy this extension gives  Love is the best device  but among certain lovers this  grande egoisme seul  is crossed with a divided attention  There is a curiosity as to the real nature and habits of the beloved  even a generosity which would enquire whether the man or the woman is satisfied  Out of a sincere passion of this quality these poems are 36 The Little Review made  Conceptions of love and proportions are in transition  Ecstasy is modified by affection made hesitant by a modesty of mind  In the dedication he writes  Though I have given you all of myself  what have I gained       Can I be glad seeing the life weariness in your eyes   This turns into an evasion of sentiment  fanées comme les vieux gants    To be loved is nothing  to receive is nothing  If you seeks happiness  love and give       In  An Interlude  he has observed the stations of a passions  but the naive poems that follow are spoilt by sophisticated phrasing  To write plainly about the body of one s lover it should not be necessary to use images which are Museum pieces of literary association crushed flowers and asps and Lesbia s eyes  Her body is honey and wheat The taste of her mouth is delicate Her eyes overcome me with desire Her feet are a woman s  This poem is a good moving piece of sentiment  It is Solomon speaking with the  all in  rhetoric of Hebrew erotics  It has precision and weight and conveys longing  In  Daybreak  he uses the Fleckerised  ghazel   Not all the blood of all our dead  the bright gay blood so gaily shed Shines with so clear a glow as gleams your breast flower from our candid bed So on to the war  Passion hurries through the paces of the poem to its finale  The pleasure is broken off clean  the emotion is bare and carries  I would not have her pine and weep  I would not have her love again  Whatever comes after I die There will be only pain and pain  In the decent stoicism of the epilogue pleasure is buried with a hope of recurrence  It will recur  Similar things will be said about it  But in the epilogue the most sincere and competent poet of his group has summarised with an emotional sincerity that gives beauty  his realisation that this is a very bad universe whose chief mitigation is love  It is something to say of love poetry that there is not a poem in the book which has not the same quality of sincerity  The Little Review 37 A Maker by William Carlos Williams IT never fails to anger me when I have read ten paragraphs of hair splitting argument in this or that modern paper of literary pretensions to come to the end and find it is a book boost  The trick seems to be to air a number of more or less pleasant fancies and then to refer casually at the end to a new book by Mr  Soandso  I have a definite and constant determination to set up in his place the man whom I find to be a poet and to revile and beat down endemic critics such as the Louis Untermeyrs who leave their pock marks wherever they are given an inch of entry and who are opposed to my excellences  What if I do not succeed  What if I am wrong in my judgments  To the full of my power I intend to maintain my fight as long as I live  This is no time to quibble over nice merits or demerits  Wallace Gould is an exquisite performer upon his instrument  By his instrument I mean his Maine  I have said my say against  the chance lovely singers  who pipe up and do conventional ditties in Wyoming or Texas or Delaware or Nebraska  taking in the ready scenery of the place  and whose poetry is judged to be excellent by the  connoisseurs  because it is so charming  Wallace Gould is not one of these  Yes  he sticks to what he sees  what he knows  but the quiet scorn of his music has set him free  He is free in form  since any other freedom for an artist does not exist  free to turn his emotion into the use he sees fit to put it to without a thread to bind it upon some sterile track  If he is lovely in his portrayal of a landscape  always a pure Maine landscape  one had better be on his guard for that pigment is in the hands of a master  If you dare to praise him for his loveliness you will find out that he has perhaps turned you around in the dark and soon you are out of the house by the back way  The artist throughout everything is conscious and working at his images with unerring leisure and often with horrid intention  This is the thing that no tissue paper critic can stand  That an artist should be a man of power  that he should use a catbird to proclaim the death of the whole world  that he should be such a mean fellow as to befool the poor critic who has been trying so hard to explain things  I am not writing of a book  though book there must be when a publisher shall have emerged  I am writing of certain manuscripts 38 The Little Review of Gould s which I had the good fortune to hold in my hands and read through and more especially to poems published in Others and the Little Review  An artist of immaculate craft Gould is  But I have another reason for praising him  It is because he has stuck to what he knows for his songs  No artist cares a damn where a man comes from or how he comes by the knowledge of perceptive values he uses in his work  But to me there is an overwhelming satisfaction in feeling that a man can be a poet under any circumstances and that this has not removed him from his world but has fastened him upon it with such a deadly grip that he has transformed it in spite of itself  It is for the poet to announce that no condition can change him  that be he American  Russian Chinese  Jew he is poet first  last and always  But one way of announcing this is to take any  thing  take the land at your feet and use it  It is as good material as another  It is no better but it is as good  In fact the material is nothing  But to prove it is nothing one must no depend on special circumstance  one must use it  It might one day become imperative for a man to write of some environment foreign to his own provided the use of his own had grown to be a fetish  but Gould s heroic battle  his determination to use nothing but his Maine  at least in the poems I speak of  gives me an additional sense of joy in his mastery  Poetry is made by the hands of the poet out of nothing  This must be continually proclaimed  Not only must the assertion be made to a possible public but there must be a proclamation by the poet to himself which is far more important  Then for God s sake let us proclaim to ourselves that it isn t made out of the brains of Frenchmen  Englishmen or dead Greeks  Poetry is as fully at home in the woodsy brain of Wallace Gould as in another man s living in Teheran  I for one am inspired to feel the presence of so capable an artist north of me  a man full of quietness and love and bitterness and infinite bravery and pointed scorn for the world of jackasses  I have nowhere said that Gould is a great poet  I wish I could find the material for making such an assertion  I don t know the man s range  I only begin to feel the depth of his intensity  but that he is a splendid artist I declare now as well as I am able  The Little Review 39  Editor s note  Disagreeing with most of Dr  Williams s ar  ticle  as with Marsden Hartley s last month  I shall try to carry forward this discussion in the September number  not that I wish to use Wallace Gould s poetry as a special point of debate  but that I am interested in  putting over  certain abstractions about art which most people in this country seem to look upon as unintelligible  THE end of the war sees a great deal of artistic activity on this side  but of an excessively diffuse nature  Art and Letters which made some stir with a first number containing Wyndham Lewis s long story  The War Baby   in its second number dished up a feeble mush of Beardsley s Venus and Tannhauser  A newer venture  Coterie  contains an excellent poem by T  S  Eliot  and one or two other names  among them T  W  Earp  though badly represented  The Athenaeum is a rather solid weekly now being edited by J  Middleton Murry and contains good critical stuff by Eliot  James and Lytton Strachey and Aldous Huxley  It is about the only weekly with some constructive literary standard  In the theatre the newest upstarts are the Art Theatre  directed by Madame Donnet  and the Everyman Theatre  The former made its debut with a first performance of Tchekhoff s  Seagull   After a manifesto which reads  The aim of the Art Theatre is to unite under one roof and under one direction all the various allied arts necessary for the proper expression of Drama  In the productions equal care will be bestowed upon ensemble and upon the individual interpretation of each part         the show was trifling  The play was badly produced  the cast  drawn from revue and musical comedy  worked badly together there was no ensemble in fact and the setting was paltry  One hopes the wealthy patron was pleased  This waste of public money is however very trying  The Everyman Theatre is anxious to raise a preliminary 8000 pounds apparently to produce Dunsany s plays and those of others unspecified Ibsen seems to be indicated and Rann Kennedy  John Drinkwater  Gilbert Cannan and Bernard Shaw have been lecturing for the venture so no doubt they are to be included   They have a paper called Theatrecraft   M C A   Notes by John Rodker 40 The Little Review a symposium of ill assorted names with no coherence of aim  The Arts League of

has been subject to a rigid  merciless control  having for its object the systematic suppression of ideas  The  motivation is very clear  It is in essence economic  just as its modus operandi is economic  Irving Kaye Davis Company  new book publishers  believe that the public is entitled to an absolutely free  absolutely in  dependent  and fearless press  We believe that a publishing house should be so thoroughly permeated wtih the spirit of the artist and of the aesthete as to be only secondarily a business concern  We have set out to demonstrate that literature and idealism are not incompatible  that they are in the very broadest and deepest sense synonomous  We shall attempt to mirror the epic transformations  the cataclysmic changes which are taking place in the life of the world  Before our eyes unfolds the greatest pageant of all history  the drama of the Social Revolution  It is our hope that we may serve in some small measure as the interpreter of this tremendous movement  and of the concomitant changes in politics  economics  industry  art  ethics and science  American literature has need of free  unfettered expression of the profoundest realities ofexistence  We must break away rom the popular and prevalent sentimentalism of the day  We must stop appealing to the jaded intellect of the  Tired Business Merit  not popularity  should be our ultimate criterion  It is with you  thinkers and dreamers of America  that we rest our case  Regardless of your opinions  regardless of your individual beliefs  we invite your support  Believing in youth and freedom  proud of being visionaries  we are confident of the outcome   We pre keen to follow the beateous lure of a dream    We will publish the books  but it is you  our unknown friends who will read them and give them success  Others ho have tried to be untrarmmelled have failed  But we are just innocent enough not to worry about that  If you are interested in the experiment will you send us your name  IRVING KAYE DAVIS COMPANY Publishers 116 West 11th St   New York
