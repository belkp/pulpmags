OCTOBER 1922  AVENEL GRAY  VENEL GRAY at fifty had gray hair Gray eyes and a gray cat coincidence Agreeable enough to be approved And shared by all her neighbors or by all Save one who had in his abused esteem No share of it worth having Avenel Gray At fifty had the favor and the grace Of thirty the gray hair being only a jest Of time he reasoned whereby the gray eyes Were maybe twenty or maybe a thousand Never could he persuade himself to say How old or young they were or what was in them   Or whether in the mind or in the heart Of their possessor there had ever been Or ever should be more than room enough For the undying dead All he could say Would be that she was now to him a child A little frightened or a little vexed And now a sort of Miss Methusaleh Adept and various in obscurity And in omniscience rather terrible Until she smiled and was a child again Seeing with eyes that had no age in them That his were growing older Seneca Sprague At fifty had hair grayer such as it was Than Avenel s an atoll as it were Circling a smooth lagoon of indignation Whereunder were concealed no treacheries Or monsters that were perilous to provoke  Seneca sat one Sunday afternoon With Avenel in her garden There was peace And languor in the air but in his mind There was not either there was Avenel And where she was and she was everywhere There was no peace for Seneca So today Should see the last of him in any garden Where a sphynx child with gray eyes and gray hair Would be the only flower that he might wish To pluck wishing in vain I m here again Seneca said and I m not here alone  You may observe that I ve a guest with me  This time Time being the guest Scythe glass and all  You have it the whole ancient apparatus  Time is a guest not given to long waiting  And in so far as you may not have known it  I m Destiny For more than twenty years  My search has been for an identity  Worth Time s acknowledgment and heretofore  My search has been but a long faltering  Paid with an unavailing gratitude  And unconfessed encouragement from you  What is it in me that you like so much  And love so little I m not so much a monkey  As many who have had their heart s desire  And have it still My perishable angel  Since neither you nor I may live forever  Like this I ll say the folly that has fooled us  Out of our lives was never mine but yours  There was an understanding long ago  Between the laws and atoms that your life  And mine together were to be a triumph  But one contingency was overlooked  And that was a complete one All you love  And all you dare to love is far from here  Too far for me to find where I am going  Going Avenel said Where are you going   There was a frightened wonder in her eves Until she found a way for them to laugh At first I thought you might be going to tell me That you had found a new way to be old Maybe without remembering all the time How gray we are But when you soon began To be so unfamiliar and ferocious Well I began to wonder I m a woman  Seneca sighed before he shook his head At Avenel You say you are a woman And I suppose you are If you are not I don t know what you are and if you are I don t know what you mean  By what she said A faint bewildered flush covered her face While Seneca felt within her voice a note As near to sharpness as a voice like hers Might have in silent hiding What have I done So terrible all at once that I m a stranger  You are no stranger than you always were He said and you are not required to be so You are no stranger now than yesterday Or twenty years ago or thirty years Longer ago than that when you were born You and your brother I m not here to scare you Or to pour any measure of reproach   Out of a surplus urn of chilly wisdom For watching you to find out whether or not You shivered swallowing it would be no joy For me But since it has all come to this Which is the same as nothing only worse I am not either wise or kind enough It seems to go away from you in silence My wonder is today that I have been So long in finding what there was to find Or rather in recognizing what I found Long since and hid with incredulities That years have worn away leaving white bones Before me in a desert All those bones If strung together would be a skeleton That once upheld a living form of hope For me to follow until at last it fell Where there was only sand and emptiness For a long time there was not even a grave Hope having died there all alone you see And in the dark And you being as you are Inseparable from your traditions well I went so far last evening as to fancy Having no other counsellor than myself To guide me that you might be entertained If not instructed hearing how far I wandered Following hope into an empty desert And what I found there If we never know What we have found and are accordingly   Adrift upon the wreck of our invention We make our way as quietly to shore As possible and we say no more about it But if we know too well for our well being That what it is we know had best be shared With one who knows too much of it already Even kindliness becomes or may become A strangling and unwilling incubus A ghost would often help us if he could But being a ghost he can t I may confuse Regret with wisdom but in going so far As not impossibly to be annoying My wish is that you see the part you are Of nature When you find anomalies here Among your flowers and are surprised at them Consider yourself and be surprised again For they and their potential oddities Are all a part of nature So are you Though you be not a part that nature favors And favoring carries on You are a monster A most adorable and essential monster  He watched her face and waited but she gave him Only a baffled glance before there fell So great a silence there among the flowers That even their fragrance had almost a sound And some that had no fragrance may have had He fancied an accusing voice of color   Edwin Arlington Robinson  Which her pale cheeks now answered with another Wherefore he gazed a while at tiger lilies Hollyhocks dahlias asters and hydrangeas The generals of an old anonymous host That he knew only by their shapes and faces Beyond them he saw trees and beyond them A still blue summer sky where there were stars In hiding as there might somewhere be veiled Eternal reasons why the tricks of time Were played like this Two insects on a leaf Would fill about as much of nature s eye No doubt as would a woman and a man At odds with heritage Yet there they sat A woman and a man beyond the range Of all deceit and all philosophy To make them less or larger than they were The sun might only be a spark among Superior stars but one could not help that  If a grim God that watches each of us In turn like an old fashioned schoolmaster Seneca said still gazing at the blue Beyond the trees no longer satisfies Or tortures our credulity with harps Or fires who knows if there may not be laws Harder for us to vanquish or evade Than any tyrants Rather we know there are Or you would not be studying butterflies   While I m encouraging Empedocles In retrospect He was a mountain climber You may remember and while I think of him I think if only there were more volcanoes More of us might be climbing to their craters To find out what he found You are sufficient You and your cumulative silences Today to make of his abysmal ashes The dust of all our logic and our faith And since you can do that you must have power That you have never measured Or if you like A power too large for any measurement Has done it for you made you as you are And led me for the last time possibly To bow before a phantom in your garden He smiled until he saw tears in her eyes And then remarked Here comes a friend of yours Pyrrhus you call him Pyrrhus because he purrs  I found him reading Hamlet Avenel said By which I mean that I was reading Harriet But he s an old cat now And I m another If you mean what you say or seem to say If not what in the world s name do you mean  He met the futile question with a question Almost as futile and almost as old Why have I been so long learning to read   Edwin Arlington Robinson  Or learning to l gt e willing to believe That I was learning All that I had to do Was to remember that your brother once Was here and is here still Why have I waited Why have you made me wait so long to say so Although he said it kindly and foresaw That in his kindness would be pain he said it More to the blue beyond the trees perhaps Or to the stars that moved invisibly To laws implacable and inviolable Than to the stricken ears of Avenel Who looked at him as if to speak He waited Until it seemed that all the leaves and flowers The butterflies and the cat were waiting also  Am I the only woman alive she asked Who has a brother she may not forget If you are here to be mysterious Ingenuousness like mine may disappoint you And there are women somewhere certainly Riper for mysteries than I am yet You see me living always in one place And all alone  No you are not alone Seneca said I wish to God you were And I wish more that you had been so always That you might be so now Your brother is here And yet he has not been here for ten years   Though you ve a skill to crowd your paradigms Into a cage like that and keep them there You may not yet be asking quite so much Of others for whom the present is not the past We are not all magicians and Time himself Who is already beckoning me away Would surely have been cut with his own scythe And long ago if he had followed you In all your caprioles and divagations You have deceived the present so demurely That only few have been aware of it And you the least of all You do not know How much it was of you that was not you That made me wait And why I was so long In seeing that it was never to be you Is not for you to tell me for I know I was so long in seeing it was not you Because I would not see I wonder now If I should take you up and carry you off Like an addressable orang outang You might forget the grave where half of you Is buried alive and where the rest of you Whatever you may believe it may be doing Is parlously employed As if to save His mistress the convention of an answer The cat jumped up into her lap and purred Folded his paws and looked at Seneca Suspiciously I might almost have done it   Edwin Arlington Robinson  He said if insight and experience Had not assured me it would do no good Don t be afraid I have tried everything Only to be assured it was not you That made me fail If you were here alone You would not see the last of me so soon And even with you and the invisible Together maybe I might have seized you then Just hard enough to leave you black and blue Not that you would have cared one way or other With him forever near you and if unseen Always a refuge No I should not have hurt you It would have done no good yet might perhaps Have made me likelier to be going away At the right time Anyhow damn the cat  Seneca looked at Avenel till she smiled And so let loose a tear that she had held In each of her gray eyes I am too old She said and too incorrigibly alone For you to laugh at me You have been saying More nonsense in an hour than I have heard Before in forty years Why do you do it Why do you talk like this of going away Where would you be and what would you be doing You would be like a cat in a strange house Like Pyrrhus here in yours I have not had My years for nothing and you are not so young   As to be quite so sure that I m a child We are too old to be ridiculous And we ve been friends too long  W e have been friends Too long he said to be friends any longer And there you have the burden of a song That I came here to sing this afternoon When I said friends you might have halted me For I meant neighbors  I know what you meant Avenel answered gazing at the sky And then at Seneca The great question is What made you say it You mention powers and laws As if you understood them Am I stranger Than powers and laws that make me as I am  God knows you are no stranger than you are For which I praise Him Seneca said devoutly I see no need of prayer to bring to pass For me more prodigies or more difficulties I cry for them no longer when I know That you are married to your brother s ghost Even as you were married to your brother Never contending or suspecting it Yet married all the same You are alone But only in so far as to my eyes The sight of your beloved is unseen Why should I come between you and your ghost   Whose hand is always chilly on my shoulder Drawing me back whenever I go forward I should have been acclaimed stronger than he Before he died but he can twist me now And I resign my dream to his dominion And if by chance of an uncertain urge Of weariness or pity you might essay The stranglings of a twofold loyalty The depth and length and width of my estate Measured magnanimously would be but that Of half a grave I d best be rational I m saying therefore to myself today And leave you quiet I can originate No reason larger than a leucocyte Why you should not since there are two of you Be tranquil here together till the end  You would not tell me this if it were true And I if it were true should not believe it Said Avenel stroking slowly with cold hands The cat s warm coat But I might still be vexed Yes even with you and that would be a pity It may be well for you to go away Or for a while perhaps I have not heard Such an unpleasant nonsense anywhere As this of yours I like you Seneca But not when you bring Time and Destiny As now you do for company When you come   Some other day leave your two friends outside We have gone well without them for so long That we shall hardly be tragedians now Not even if we may try and we have been Too long familiar with our differences To quarrel or to change  Avenel smiled At Seneca with gray eyes wherein were drowned Inquisitive injuries and the gray cat yawned At him as he departed with a sigh That answered nothing He went slowly home Imagining as a fond improvisation That waves huger than Andes or Sierras Would soon be overwhelming as before A ship that would be sunk for the last time With all on board and far from Tilbury Town  Edwin Arlington Robinson   NOVELETTE  DIAGONALS  Now this is the strangest thing since the world began  You tell me that you are a bad and a violent man But I see only A child little and lonely  Crying with fright in a desolate place apart  While I am known as chaste and reasonably good  But you are blind to my virtuous womanhood Somehow you see Dragged out of the depths of me  The wanton that every women hides in her heart  IGNIS FATUUS  Your fires are false they tell me So I knew it long and long ago  But I choose false ones for my play They are the safer any day  And if I burn my hands a bit Why who will ever know of it  All this I said when I was proud Under my breath almost aloud    Then I plunged boldly in and played By my own fires I am betrayed  WEEK END  I am glad I have come Let me stay let me stay I would not go home Let me rest in your kindness Your blessed blindness For a night and a day Your sweet incurious eyes Would widen in sharp surprise If you knew how under my breath I pray Let me sleep to death O God let me never go home But I speak through the fragrant gloom Of your hushed and decorous room Yes I am glad I have come  RELEASE  All that I had of wings And they were not large nor bright I broke against the harshness of your grieving Night after night   Aline Kilmer  All that I had of song It was weak and low I fear Was sung to ease the ache of your own sorrow But you would not hear  All that I had of tears And my tears were warm and blest Were shed to make your agony less lonely Upon your breast  All that I asked to share Was the pain that you would not show Now I have given you all that I had to give you Will you let me go  ESCAPE  indifference may snare me but only devotion can hold me Where is the net you spread in hope that its meshes might fold me Like a shadow I slipped through a web too slight to bind me Now free and wise I cast the last frail threads on the wind behind me  Aline Kilmer   TWO POEMS  OPEN HANDS  Answer now you watch the full stalks of ironweed break And carry their red seed among the leaves and spray Beats them from the wind  I wish that sowing ironweed seed With children bringing me full stalks running to the  orchard To strip seed for me took my time now Their wet hands This grass white headed because the seed s threshed  raked The sand rising when I imagined love when I was Too proud for children Go down again they are grown You sand moving you sharp duning sand sing against The dead grass blades and fall here and cover me Fill  my hands Dry me out like dead bird quills milk my strength still I know That spirit is come to an end There is no pain  You talk to the sand and let me go let me go When the wind rose I thought that spirit knew of the sand And desired voice and hands and that I knew that  strength But your words hold me too close to my own grief And make me remember what I desired and know   H L Davis  DOG FENNEL  Today burn tree prunings Dead branches are cut and piled And the soft stemmed grass broken and raked to kindle  them Rain beats a little light dust up from the sand This is the time when birds come to pick the grass seed Exposed white on the ground sweetened with dead roots Grown since you marked the scoured furrows with your  name You made prints of your breasts here when you were lately  grown But they are beaten out and all the dog fennel Is burned that stung your eyes with its white bitter dust O dead sister your pride keeps seasons like the birds  H L Davis  THE SEEKER  Your life seemed consecrated to a vow To seek for truth even though the seeking led Through solitary frozen ways And now You ve found it yet they speak of you as dead  Antoinette De Coursey Patterson   THE LINE FENCE  It was boots and spurs and hat and gun In a hole by a willow tree And that is how we planted him Where the line fence ought to be  Bill left his gun with the town marshal An I at the livery An I only had two jolts of gin An a little rye in me When up comes this Hyannis Hal An he wouldn t drink with me  He snorted some an cavorted some He slobbered an wagged his chin An he swore that he would wade in the gore Of us an all our kin Roll up your pants Hyannis An come a steppin in  I got my gun from the livery An Bill at the town marshal An we was joggin pleasantly Along the Wolf Creek trail An at Warbonnet Springs rides out This same Hyannis Hal  Says I You missed the section line She s on my land five rod   I put her there an there she stays If I got to wade in blood  I ll wade in blood to my belt gets red I ll wade in blood to my chin I answered back like a feller does On a couple of jolts of gin It seemed like there was too much talk So the doin s they begin  It was boots and spurs and hat and gun In a hole by a willow tree And that was how we planted him Where the line fence ought to be  Edwin Ford Piper  CARE  Care now lies Where Care was not  Shoved in the corner But not forgot Care in the corner  I would call Laughter Out of the trees  But Laughter has bird eyes And Laughter sees Care in the corner  Janet Norris Bangs   OCTOBER  The sob that comes after the weeping is over The smile after laughter Faith when youth s gone and death beckons The sum of life plus a dream  GENDER  I don t know whether October s a man or a woman When I say She He looks at me with such masculine eyes And when I say He She shakes her red head at me So I think maybe October s a child or a god  FOOLISH BIRD  Foolish bird Do you think because the rain s over And the sun s in your eyes Summer s here again Don t you know it s October  Foolish bird that sings in my heart  GRAY RIVER  Gray river Do you care that the wind s kisses are cold now That they are putting away the little summer boats   Jewell Bothwell Tull  SUM  Just when the year learn What life is all about Just when she learns it s not youth  Nor summer s hot kisses Nor even maternity Just when she knows  What it s all for Winter and spring and summer The sum of it October  Next month you ll be so gray and tired And then so still and white October  GOD LIKE  Having given you all and got nothing Having built here a fire for you A fire that burned red and blue And white now Having given you all and got nothing Why should I care I am more like God now  Jewell Bothwell Tull    ON THE EDGE  GONE UNDER  Rob had ambition came to Africa To live the strenuous life and make a fortune He had energy his mother s money and a boy s high hope He met a planter tobacco was the thing Was offered shares He put in all he had He worked God he sweat blood Rounding up niggers in the broiling sun Planting digging trying hard for sales Cigars were not two pounds the thousand lot His partner used to loll in a long chair Groggy with whiskey kissing his black girl Rob cleared out finally picked clean He tried for jobs had fever lost his nerve Bubunde nursed him cynical old chief Rob took his girl to wife to get her cows And grows his manioc on her fertile land And smokes his pipe and drinks banana beer Sometimes we chat of evenings But by day he keeps away  THE WHITE FATHER  Men never know what s written in their stars Paul was a cadet of an old French line   A lad he was devout on fire to serve Became père blanc wore robes and grew a soft brown  beard Three times in Africa he learned new tongues To bring the blacks to Christ He baptized greasy babes confirmed half naked urchins Wed savages in skins and beads And heard thick lipped confessions He heard one too many A slim young jade in scarlet calico Bare shouldered saucy eyed Came whispering  Later he in his turn confessed the wrong he d done The coming trouble One child more or less To native wenches would not shake the world But his superior was virtuous Paul was unfrocked no longer a père blanc He married that black girl He brought their black brat to the Holy Fount By his small hut he tried to keep it clean He grew good vegetables to sell to the few Europeans of  the post At last he shot himself  Not in the consecrated ground Could he find burial But on a lonely hillside weighted down With stones to keep the beasts away   TH E TOSS  It s a million miles from Here to There And not a soul who s here to care  Whether I sit by my lonely fire And smoke till the last grey ashes expire  Or whether I go down the narrow way The goats spring up at break of day  Past the huts where the thatched roofs gleam Silver domed in the moonlight s beam  Past the shambas where shadows deep Beneath the broad banana leaves sleep  On to a hut in the thorn tree glade Where a brown skinned ankleted slim young jade  Sulky and supple is waiting for me Well shall I go Toss a coin and see  Cecil John    OLD COURTESAN S LAMENT  Faces faces faces Why do ye turn away  Young and old Why will ye not gaze into my face  Come I am thirsty Give me the chalice of your faces  How can I forget Limbs helpless with lust  How can time take from me The woundings of claw sharp hands  And the pleading anger of eyes That burn with hate of love  1 am withering with hunger I who fed your famished sex  Bring me the bare pittance of your pleasure Young and old faces faces faces  Dhan Gopal Mukerji    WORLDS  I have known or seen all the worlds of this world And some of the worlds of the world to come And I say to you that every world lives to itself And is known to itself alone Though it moves among the other worlds of this world  I was in a hospital and given up to die That is one of the worlds I had turned blue And they moved me to the charity ward of the dying And that is one of the worlds They had screens around us So that we could not see each other die But they had no way to shut out from each of us The cries and prayers of the others Next me was a little woman they called butter ball She was yellow from cancer And had been cut to death by the surgeons She cried all night she died at dawn Just as I began to mend  There is the world of the internes making love to the  nurses And the world of the surgeons hurrying to dinners And the applause of learned societies And the world of their children at school or in play Ignorant of what it means to be learned and notable   And to be the children of such men There is the world of the policeman who walks by The hospital at night And the world of the taxi drivers Who never see the hospital as they rush past There is the world of the man and the woman in the taxi Kissing each other in anticipation of the place of assigna  tion There is the world of the train crew Who make up the limited back of the hospital  And the world of travelers happy or anxious  Going or coming  And this day there was for myself  This world of getting well  With its meaning and its happiness  Unguessed by the world of the well  And my eyes were opened to the worlds By suffering and coming from that world  Of the charity ward of the dying  And I saw that there is the world of a merchant  And the world of a judge  And the world of a legislator or a president  And the world of a rich man  And the world of a poor man  And the world of a defeated man  And the world of a victorious man  And the world of a ruling nation  And the world of a people who are ruled   And the world of a servant a laborer And the world of a master and a user And the world of passion And the world of love And the world of envy And the world of hate And the world of strife And the world of convicts And those condemned to death And the world of war and warriors And the world of the young And the world of the old And the world of desire unceasing And the world of desire that is dead And the world of those who see God And the world of those who see Him not And the world of the faithful the hopeful And the world of doubters and the hopeless And the world of those who have loneliness forever And the world of those who ease loneliness With futile activity And the world of those who seek truth and find it not And the world of those who never give up In the search for beauty And the world of those to whom the world is harmonious  sound And the world of those to whom the world is atoms or stars   Edgar Lee Masters  And the world of those to whom the world is a machine And the world of those to whom the world is life And the world of those to whom the world is an infinite  mass To be carved as the will wills And the world of those to whom the world is chaos And the world of those to whom the world is memory And the world of those to whom the world is regret And the world of those entangled in subtle horrors And eaten minute by minute by thoughts that die not And the world of those who front and touch The mystery of closing and suffocating horizons And the beleaguering Infinite With brows of sentinel and armed thought Standing at the heights and the Thermopolae of life Even to the hour of surprise from the plains By Death the Persian And I saw that every soul is a world to itself Making its own murmurous music night and day And having its realest world in itself And knowing none of the other worlds  And what worlds beyond our world Know our world of worlds All worlds of this world and all worlds May be but the world of the mind of God Of which He is not conscious Himself Unless He chooses to think of them  Edgar Lee Masters  COMMENT  TEN YEARS OLD  MEASURED by the stars ten years are but the trillionth of a twinkle Measured by earth aeons they are a tiny fraction of a heave Measured by historic time they are a little tenth of a century one of a thousand or more brief decades which have unrolled an open scroll for man to write his record on in ink or blood Measured by human life they are one seventh of its allotted span a fourth or a fifth of its period of power A slight affair all this a mere wink of watchful eyes that somewhere somehow look on at the mysterious march of life But measured by events of literary history ten years may be long enough to outlast the language or the race In ten years the Greek drama became in our limited human sense of the word immortal In ten years the urbane Roman inscribed his civilized message on the scroll In a third of ten years a vagabond Galilean told a few stories and preached and died In ten years was it more or less a melancholy exile in Italy made the affairs of his neighbors important forever In ten years Hamlet and King Lear and Much Ado About Nothing were born into imperishable life In ten years Byron Shelley and Keats were singing songs too beautiful to be forgotten In ten years Poe uttered his last lyric cry and Whitman began to gather his Leaves    And so of our ten years what will be said the ten years of the World War of falling and rising nations of the Russian revolution of a thousand new movements and new hopes In the face of events so tremendous will the world little heed nor long remember what we say here or will it accept our offering as adequate and repeat over and over through the crowded ways of the new time the songs which our poets have sung to a changing age  Who are they these poets of the decade which POETRY has counted off from month to month with never a break since October 1912 since Ezra Pound with much tumult and shouting buried the dry bones of the past and sounded the tocsin for a new era In singles and pairs and cohorts they came trooping Vachel Lindsay Robert Frost Carl Sandburg and Edgar Lee Masters Wallace Stevens D H Lawrence and T S Eliot Conrad Aiken and Rupert Brooke Sara Teasdale and Edna St Vincent Millay the imagists H D and Amy Lowell Richard Aldington John Gould Fletcher the ironists Carlos Williams Alfred Kreymborg Maxwell Boden heim Marianne Moore Robinson had begun over a decade before Masefield and Witter Bynner and Arthur Ficke a few years Ford Madox Hueffer repented Victorian sins and swung new made into the procession Tagore translated himself Waley and others translated the Chinese and aboriginal singers were interpreted by Frank Gordon Constance Skinner Mary Austin and the    other poets of the Rainbow Anthology And besides these poets of other nations have come in by the translator s by path poets from France from the Spanish countries from Russia from Scandinavia  At least it is a long list and a varied one which we of the past decade offer to the serene choice of the next age On this tenth anniversary it would be idle for POETRY to deny a certain pride in its share of the record in its measure of responsibility for the gathering together of these poets in its offer of an exhibition gallery and an audience The gallery may have been far from perfect and the editorial jury far from wise but the audience though smaller than it should be has been choice and penetratingly cosmopolitan POETRY has readers all over the world  We may take some pride also in the stimulating effect of the magazine upon this far flung audience POETRY has changed my point of view says one the verse I wrote ten years ago seems stilted Another writes Here in China you are my only contact with the new poets the new ideas A wandering Englishman sends us from Port Said the group of sketches included in the present number confessing I don t know whether these are poetry or not but a friend showed me a copy of your magazine and I decided to offer them From Madrid from Constantinople from Brazil and the City of Mexico and far away antipodal Tasmania come constantly these evidences that POETRY is enriching lives   and stimulating the impulse toward artistic expression toward the creation of beauty  Still more precious than these evidences from lands remote are the proofs we receive from people nearer home such proofs as the following mentioned recently by Lew Sarett after a lecture trip in Iowa and written out at the editor s request  The January number of POETRY which I found on file in the reading room of the Public Library of Council Bluffs was much thumbed and dog eared The librarian said that the magazine is read by many  At Mt Ayr tucked away down in the south west corner of the state a man drove in for my address thirty odd miles He told me that he subscribed for POETRY believed that it was doing a fine work He was an exceedingly well read man a leavening force I imagine in that remote corn fed section  At Clear Lake twelve miles from Mason City half a dozen women came up to me after the lecture and said that they had come over from Mason City to hear me One of them asked why I failed to read one of the stanzas in one of my poems I was surprised she apparently knew my poems as well as I did The facts came out she and the other women were librarians in Mason City they said that they read POETRY every month that many people in Mason City read it and that as soon as the magazine arrives each month all the librarians read it  These facts should be very heartening to you they were to me They show this much if no more POETRY is reaching and molding the what shall we call it the rank and file the non esthetes you name it to a larger degree than one might think Too often the statement is made that a literary journal like POETRY reaches only a limited pinched out art group so it does one s heart good to see that it is a force in the lives of many just plain folk It pleases me particularly because it tends to show that the Gopher Prairies of Sinclair Lewis are not all so benighted and artistically dead as he alleges  Such testimony is precious because it proves an influence profound and fundamental exerted by the mag   azine If America is ever to have a rich spiritual life and to express that life in art this art must come not from super civilized coteries but from the vital strength of the nation Too much of the vital strength of the nation is now being frittered away in Gopher Prairie banalities an emptiness in which the art impulse is smothered in which the seed of genius can never come to flower The spiritual enrichment of the Gopher Prairies is the great problem the stimulation of faith in the heart of the people faith in their power not only to perceive but to create beauty Without such faith life is stagnant everywhere there are pitiful gropings toward it which need impulse and direction If POETRY is one of the quickening influences which will make a vital people aware of its imaginative and creative power then we may feel indeed that our ten years of labor have not  been thrown away  The great ages of art we have said it often come only when a wide spread creative impulse meets an equally wide spread impulse of sympathy A masterpiece is rarely an isolated phenomenon a single tree from a chance sown seed dropped from the wings of Pegasus but almost always the product of group influence the highest tree in a forest When every Gopher Prairie has its local exhibition its dramatic society producing not only ready made plays but also the experiments of its members its musical society hospitable to local compositions and its poetry group writing and criticizing   poetry from within as well as reading it from without when all this happens the future of American art will take care of itself  On its tenth birthday POETRY acknowledges with thanks the monthly salutation of its readers and salutes them in return  Ten years as we said above are a long time measured by events of literary history and may be multiplied indefinitely in human memory Whether the magazine will be recorded in the history of twentieth century literature only the future can decide But in the history of such enterprises POETRY may claim a proud preeminence The Germ The Chap book The Yellow Book Blast Poetry and Drama New Numbers Others none of these lived ten years Nor could POETRY have survived so long without its guarantors to whose loyalty its poets and readers as well as its editors owe their appreciative thanks It may be that no such work as ours can be done without endowment indeed precedents in the other arts would seem to prove this Whether we cease tomorrow or continue another decade we shall hope that such endeavors for the art may go on under abler minds and ever more liberal auspices  H M   REVIEWS  A GEORGIAN INTELLECTUALIST  Real Property by Harold Monro Poetry Bookshop  London  Mr Harold Monro is fairly well known to that part of the English speaking world which concerns itself with poetry as the organizer and chief showman of the Georgians This position which he holds is slightly unfair to Mr Monro If he is a Georgian it is a Georgian with a difference To speak the truth there are in him two poets the first a patient and tireless observer of little things who persuades himself daily and hourly that whatever is nearest in life is also most important and that the only way to write poetry is by simplifying technique down to the most bare and arid statement of fact the second a restless dissatisfied seeker always wondering if the veil of consciousness will somehow lift and reveal the hidden purpose of God The first Mr Monro is a Georgian the second is or should be a metaphysical poet The difference and the contrast between the two their combination in a single writer is enlightening and instructive  The poetry that ought to interest Mr Monro the most and possibly does interest him the most is the tortuously convoluted elaborately artificial work of such poets as Donne or Lord Herbert of Cherbury in the past or Mr  T S Eliot today but for some reason which I do not   A Georgian Intellectualist  pretend to fathom he has attempted to avoid the consequences of being a poet whose path of approach to the subject is more largely intellectual than emotional The passion for emotional rapture does not seize upon him and he has elected to avoid equally the passion for thought That passion expresses itself in the case of Donne in an elaborate play of verbal conceit and in a vocabulary stiffened with inner scholastic meanings and strained to the utmost point of expression Unfortunately it is not possible for a modern poet to write in this style The old rhetoric having gone by the board for once and for all the modern poet whose interests are intellectual rather than emotional has either to invent an elaborate technique of his own or to give up writing Mr Monro has done neither Instead he has tried to express very complex ideas in the simplest language with the result that his poems now read like this  You only need to close your eyes And go within your secret mind And you ll be into paradise  I ve learnt quite easily to find Some linden trees and drowsy bees A tall sweet hedge with the corn behind  I will not have that harvest mown I ll keep the corn and have the bread I ve bought that field it s now my own I ve fifty acres in my head I take it as a dream to bed I carry it about all day   Sometimes when I have found a friend I give a blade of corn away  These lines are taken from Real Property which is the latest of Mr Monro s slim volumes I have quoted them here as a fair sample of his technique It is worthy of note that the idea which these lines express is a very subtle one But we are neither attracted to the idea nor ensnared by its subtlety for the reason that it is expressed in a style which recalls a child s primer The author has given us not the full thought together with the essential brain processes that made it what it is but merely the schemed out result of a certain amount of preliminary thinking He has like some cubist painters given us a geometrical diagram instead of a complete picture  I cannot help thinking that to write poetry in this way is an affectation as dangerous though not so likely to be popular as the Georgian affectation which Mr Monro apparently dislikes if one may judge from the verses he has printed at the close of this volume He has acquired apparently the habit of thinking it sufficient for both the writer s and the reader s purposes merely to state his subject in the most summary terms without either developing or solving it It is a habit which has grown upon him with the years  Fortunately it is comparatively absent from his first volume Children of Love In this he is as interesting as any seeker who has not yet found a convenient for   A Georgian Intellectualist  inula in which to express himself and he is content to set down the important reactions that occur to him The book is fairly well known and its first poems like Overheard on Salt Marsh The Rebellious Vine and The Strange Companion are frequently quoted in anthologies  It is in his second book Strange Meetings that this poet ran up against the problem which has since tormented him a problem expressed in the title poem  How did you enter your body Why are you here At once when I had seen your eyes appear Over the brim of earth they were looking for me How suddenly how silently We rose into this long appointed place From what sleep have you arrived That your beauty has survived You the everlasting you Known before a word was  Obviously the only answer to that question is some form of pantheism or unanimism And Mr Monro took the hint and wrote the excellent if a little too long poem entitled Trees He also attempted unanimism in the curious but not infelicitous Everything and The Journey These three poems together with certain parts of the title poem above mentioned remain in the memory as the solid substance of Strange Meetings  Unfortunately however he did not stop there Pantheism or unanimism are at best but half solutions of the problem of the one become many of fragmentary godhead If we are God why are we temporal to   begin with and is there anything that may be called not temporal but eternal Attracted by these questions or something like them Mr Monro stripped his style still further of what he regarded probably as useless excrescences and plunged into the gulf of the unconscious dedicating himself beforehand to any careful and thoughtful reader whose mind may move in harmony with my own  The result as I have above indicated is unfortunate Mr Monro does not exert himself sufficiently to make the careful and thoughtful reader s mind move in harmony with his In consequence the whole of his first sequence becomes a series of mere schematizations outlines rather than complete poems The problems the author has set before himself remain for us also problems to the solution of which we are no nearer at the end than at the beginning and the mind gratefully turns to the comparative ease and relief of the more Georgian poems at the close such as Gold fish slightly reminiscent of Brooke as it is or the excellent City Storm which remains one of the poet s best achievements to the moment  On the whole therefore we must look on Mr Monro s work as an interesting specimen of poetry manque It somehow just misses that fire and rapture which are the possession of far less thoughtful and more slipshod practitioners of the art In general with the exceptions above noted it attracts us without moving us In this   respect it is akin to the work of most of the other Georgians though it is grounded on an intellectual honesty and willingness to experiment far greater than theirs  John Gould Fletcher  A CANADIAN POET  Moonlight and Common Day by Louise Morey Bowman The Macmillan Co of Canada Toronto A rare and exquisite spirit sometimes dancing some  times brooding companions us in this book a spirit so fine that one accepts with little question a certain looseness of technique and forgives phrasing sometimes too careless and obvious Mrs Bowman happily possesses a modern and individual imagination Her feeling is her own not inherited or borrowed her style is simple and direct and such faults as she might be accused of are not Victorian reminders  There is a certain appealing intimacy for example in the familiar and expansive poem Time pieces and it succeeds in linking up a well worn subject the rhythmic march of time not only with clocks and sun dials but with power house engines Here is the finale  At first their rush and their crashing roar Terrified me I wanted to scream and to run gasping Now the noise has become rhythmical awesome And I think queerly of deep green caverns Far under the roar of the ocean How slow slow slow   The old clock s striking at midnight In comparison With this hurrying rhythmical beat of these mighty engines Timed to the fraction of a second  Now I shall simply write down laboriously As a child writes And very reverently  God Sundials Clocks Engines Time and Eternity  This child like approach may be found in many of the poems mature feeling conceived in a child s fresh  imaginative terms One finds it in Sacrament and Earth born in Sea lavender and The Birthplace but sensitively enriched with the spirit of love which is beyond a child s experience It is love more maternal than erotic allying itself with nature in such poems as Moonlight and Common Day and The Apple Orchard and reaching a rare intensity of maternal passion in the beautiful war dialogue And Forbid Them Not and in that intuitive and poignant baby tragedy The Little Death  It is difficult to reveal in a poem or two a personality so rich and fine and a talent which attains in certain poems such a delicate bloom of beautiful and adequate expression Dinner of Herbs is strikingly quotable but neater and less original than others ditto The Pod Others mentioned above are too long to quote including And Forbid Them Not which was in POETRY some years   ago Perhaps this one Darkness is as representative as any of the briefer poems  It seems to be a foregone conclusion That if I worship the new gods Sincerely in the sunshine I must not pray in the moonlight By the shrines of the old gods Where the cherry blossoms still shine But sometimes in the darkness I mistake the shrines  And I kneel and pray and the gods speak to me And until I breathe suddenly The scent of the cherry blossoms I do not know whether they are really The old or the new shrines And by then I have wept and prayed And been answered So what does it matter  No a few extracts are not enough The book has unusual unity and personality To make friends with the poet one should read it all H M  CROSS PURPOSES  Igdrasil by Royall Snow Four Seas Co  Igdrasil is an attempt a sincere attempt at grafting together the new and the old manners but because temperamentally Mr Snow is a romantic and to an extent a moralist and because the infusion of the new has not been basic Igdrasil is after all reactionary It is when the formal device becomes a habit and appears in the creative synthesis simultaneously with image and   idea that it has matured I speak of the poet who in schooling himself has been conscious and determined enough to forego using esthetic and mental experiences which are not individual as well as common Man in love for instance has been done and done again many times here certainly the poet must have a new reaction to offer or be able by association of image to carry the old thought successfully into a new context Emotion alone will not do the trick But poetry is a well that is never exhausted for after many empty pails came The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock Royall Snow in his love poetry is too much the idealist too little the psychologist One must not be deluded by his natural ear and excellent memory for sound per se This must be inherent in the poet as in the musician as well praise a singer for being able to carry a tune Rhapsody for a Girl is the best of the love poems  I pass over the excursions into the romantic A Vision of Dead Ladies Salome and Herod Omar s Grave I pass over also such lines as  Here where we together used to lie and  They have the unplumbed cleanness of the uncaressed  and come at last to the City Sketches all interesting but one Vista which is not concrete enough These are objective and economical as well as original one wishes there were more of them For example Flirtation  Sluggishly the city   Draws her head back of a fan of night mists To hide her yawns while with her thousand eyes She coquettes lazily with the river  In the last analysis these sketches are doubtless prose divided with precision into short lines An Old Old Story includes several apt phrases As for Humanity  A poor devil of a puppy Staring half intelligent Out of great hungry eyes  here as well as in the rest of it the comparison is only too neatly hit upon Mr Snow is at his best when he effaces himself and looks on when he notes down an observation without perverting it into a text Pearl Andelson  THE POET AND INSPIRATION  Le Poète et l Inspiration by Francis Jammes Gomes Nimes France  The poet is that pilgrim sent down to earth by God to discover what may remain of our lost Paradise and of Heaven regained  The poet is that beggar seated at noon on the steps of the old garden where the first man and the first woman were so beautiful He holds in his hand his wooden bowl and his dog at his feet asks of the heedless passerby and even of God alms of the beauty which was which is and which shall be  The poet is he who watches through the high grill of the park the couples blurred in the evening blue and who hears the frail invitation of the mandolins He is not bidden to the feast but the white convolvulus rises over the gate from the shadows leans toward him who alone knows all its honey and all its warm snow And while the tender murmurs of maidens drown the song of the nightingale that song is yet   perceptible to the poet whose heart fills with its divine harmony as a stream of pure water answers the voice of the bird  The poet is he who having nothing receives everything who renounces his earthen cup to drink directly from the cool reflection of the sky  The poet is he who in the tedious and commonplace situation of an accountant in lassitude and bitterness in the monotony of office dust under the goad of an acid master perceives the luminous profile of a little five year old girl and on his work table a morsel of bread for her  The poet is he who tapping the rock with his wand draws from it in the altered village water that floods to the banks in the thick grass  The poet is he who ears heavy with silence or the noise of insult hears ascending from his heart as from a temple the song of seraphim and the voice of wisdom  The poet is he who never having taken in his arms a triumphant and beautiful wife seizes the clay of which we are made and carves out beauty  The poet is the young man I saw in an attic one day at Anvers twenty five years ago wrapped in shadows so profound that his father told me Citizens of the town have forgotten he exists He profited by this darkness to see at the bottom of the abyss a nameless star  The poet is he who leaning over a sick child gazes kindly on the agonized mother He gives her a healing bark from the tropical forest And the child s temperature falls slowly with the dusk  The poet is he who goes to sea  The poet is he who goes into the forest  The poet is he who takes in his hand a grain of wheat like a common pebble And he sees there in little the bread which the laborer s child carries under his arm and the harvest with its cornflowers its poppies and cries of insects and the church and the priest ascending to the altar and the mysterious traveller who in the evening at Emmaus confounds the light of his forehead with the shining of the Host  The poet is the man to whom God restores splendor  With these fourteen beatitudes of the poet given above only in part Francis Jammes in Le Poète et l Inspi   ration approaches the mysteries of creative beauty Happily edited by Gomes of Nîmes with two suggestive etchings by Armand Coussens one of the younger contemporary French artists the small book was published last March in a limited edition of a thousand copies It is purely an essai by a poet for poets  Francis Jammes deals with his ideas as delicately and firmly as the spider with his cobweb In his poetry he throws over the subjects of his poems small and apparently insignificant a veil of curious softness and color streaked with a humor so simple as to be deceptive One does not always know whether to smile But behind or beyond the shifting hues of his words one is aware of the mystic who seeks to discover à l extrémité de l abîme une étoile sans nom That is the key to his book  The beatitudes as I cannot help calling them come first like an abstract prologue M Jammes convictions begin with a discussion of the poets inspired by good and evil angels he places Verlaine and Baudelaire in a sort of pénombre musicale et spirituelle where the victory is won alternately by good and evil He then tries to make clear the relation of the poet to les états contemplatifs and gives him there the place of any mortal with in addition ce privilège d entendre mieux qu un mortel ordinaire les voix qui nous découvrent le Ciel Jammes believes that all mystics are not necessarily poets but that all poets are somewhat mystic His classification of poets as to their inspiration follows   I Poets dominated by evil qu i sont uniquement voués au mal ils ne sont point poètes en vérité  II Poets glorifying God indirectly by praise of his universe To this group belong Theocritus Vergil Ronsard Musset among others  III Poets lifted to regions où nous sentons par instants le tremblement de Dieu le vent d une aile d ange  In this group are Dante Cervantes Lamartine the Verlaine of Sagesse Paul Claudel  The creative mysteries attendant upon the situation of places and the invention of characters are illustrated by a reference to the case of Anne Catherine Emmerich a German saint who in an ecstatic vision the mystic describes accurately as later revealed by archaeologists the country where Christ lived and who in an imaginative flight the artist draws an unforgettably moving picture of Mary Magdalen wandering about the sepulchre But M Jammes adds Je ne dirai point que l inspiration  poétique suive le même processus This is very unsatis  factory One feels that M Jammes came to a wall here  and couldn t or wouldn t scale it  Symmetry is maintained by a concrete epilogue a presentation or picture of the house of life within which dwells the spirit characteristically enough a young girl atteinte de troubles psychiques that shall live in the soul of the poet  This little book is the wistful voice of a poet who in the quiet of his village in the Pyrenees particularizes in   esthetic terms something not all of his reactions to the creation of poetry One responds gently to his words one s eyes are softened by glimpses of his heaven one feels the blending of Catholicism with his art But I should have been content with the beatitudes alone They make the music that sustains the rest  Berenice K Van Slyke IRISH ANTHOLOGIES Anthology of Irish Verse edited with an Introduction  by Padraic Colum Boni amp Liveright Irish Poets of Today An Anthology compiled by L D O  Walters E P Dutton amp Co  It has been the peculiar misfortune of the rich and lovely body of Anglo Irish poetry that no adequate anthology has yet been made of it The two outstanding attempts in this direction hitherto have been the Golden Treasury of Irish Poetry and the Dublin Book of Irish Verse but in both these collections especially the former there is such a deal of chaff that the discouraged reader will with difficulty find the wheat The reason for this result is largely that the compilers included too much material and chose most of it from the earlier and middle decades of the nineteenth century a period when the true Irish had not yet fully mastered the English idiom with the consequence that their poetry written in English was apt to be either imitative or cramped in expression With a few exceptions it is only since the eighteen   eighties with the appearance of the group headed by  W B Yeats that the native Irish have become masters of English style Accordingly a satisfactory anthology which to my mind means a selection of the best must be drawn largely from the poetry of this period  The two collections recently published might conceivably satisfy this long felt want When we take up Mrs Walters volume however it is a keen disappointment to find that so far from being over crowded its hundred or more pages are entirely inadequate to cover its chosen field Some of the most important poets like Eva Gore Booth and Nora Chesson are represented by only a single poem each And the selections show little real discrimination for example the two lyrics by Dora Sigerson give no hint of the powerful and stark ballad poetry which is her best title to fame Moreover a number of important authors such as Eleanor Cox and Alice Milligan are omitted altogether while such relatively insignificant writers as Isobel Huske and Patrick Chalmers are given place What this collection gives us is not bad but it is not good enough  The second collection is edited by that real poet and true Irishman Padraic Colum who states in his preface that his anthology is intended to give a representation of the Irish national spirit throughout its history From such a standpoint nothing but praise can be given to this volume which is a discriminating and effective revelation of that vital and subtle spirit which is Ireland from its   earliest recorded manifestation in the fifth century A D down to the present day But Mr Colum s title should have indicated his intention and not have misled us as it does The unsuspecting reader will take up this book expecting to find in it the best of Anglo Irish poetry but instead he will find a large part of it devoted to patriotic and personal verse popular in its day but essentially journalistic and temporary For unfortunately a poem may be an excellent example of a national spirit and still be bad poetry In other words Mr Colum s collection excellent as it is in its own field is yet not a real anthology of Anglo Irish verse  In spite of these two volumes therefore the Irish poetic genius as expressed in English with its special racial passion its novel feeling for words and figures and its haunting and peculiar music still awaits a satisfactory  anthology Jack Lyman TRANSLATING OLD ENGLISH Old English Poetry Translations into Alliterative Verse by  J Duncan Spaeth Princeton University Press  Widsith Beowulf Finnsburgh Waldere Deor translated by Charles Scott Moncrieff E P Dutton amp Co Someone is always taking the joy out of life for book  reviewers by attempting a poetic translation in the original rhythmical structure of a foreign poem Once in a hundred times the attempt is successful In translations of Old English poetry into modern English the proportion  of successes is even slighter The best are doubtless Tennyson s Battle of Brunanburh which suggests rather than reproduces however the structure of the original and Ezra Pound s beautiful version of The Seafarer  The fundamental reason for the numerous failures is that Old English is in vocabulary phonology and grammar much more foreign to modern English than many realize It is more nearly akin to modern German for the poet translator most significantly in similarity of consonantal sounds and there are several good German translations of Beowulf the principal Old English poem in the original alliterative verse structure  Professor Francis B Gummere s translation of Beowulf and the poems associated with it reproduces the original spirit and metrical structure better perhaps than any other English translation  Neither Professor Spaeth s nor Mr Moncrieffs version is an outstanding addition to modern renderings of Old English verse The notes which fill a third of the former s volume form a useful commentary on the epic lyric gnomic and historic poetry which is presented The translations are workmanlike but the rhythms resemble those of modern metrics rather than the old alliterative verse and in other respects the translator shows himself the scholar more than the poet  One must search in vain for a reason for Mr MoncriefFs translation whatever interest may attach to the charming portrait of the author on the jacket and the   fatuous introduction by Lord Northcliffe within the book itself The translation preserves exceedingly well the metrical structure of the original but aside from this it is a curiosity in archaisms inversions and other peculiarities While it professes to be done into common English it contains such words as meinies oxter hythewarden seely wist and quothey In his use of modern English words Mr Moncrieff shows lack of feeling for the factors of sound implication and connotation which must be observed if the spirit of Old English literature is to be presented Nelson Antrim Crawford CORRESPONDENCE  A WORD FROM MRS HENDERSON  Dear Editor For a long time it has seemed to me hardly fair to leave my name on POETRY as Associate Editor even in an honorary capacity hardly fair that is to the rest of your active staff and now that POETRY has reached its tenth birthday I think it is high time for me to resign officially though retaining as strongly as ever my deep interest in the magazine  When I left Chicago in March 1916 I thought that I should perhaps return but now after six years in Santa Fe I feel myself as firmly rooted as a pinyon tree So here I am and there is POETRY with a distance between us but with a world in common and for me many happy   memories of my four years of active service in the old offices on Cass Street  You suggest that I send you some reminiscences for POETRY S tenth birthday but you have already covered the early years quite fully on other anniversaries and if I were to give a backward glance o er travelled roads it would probably be to recall innumerable small incidents far more amusing to us than to the general public Those were strenuous days when we had to buck the poets on the one hand and the public on the other and when 1 think of the way you have carried on during the past six years I am filled with admiration for your tenacity and zeal and high purpose You have now won the public to a deeper appreciation of poetry and the poets particularly the younger generation have to thank you for a world far less unfriendly than that into which they would have come but for your unselfish tireless services  And so with congratulations for your fine achievement I say Man y happy returns of the day and remain as ever POETRY S devoted friend and yours  Alice Corbin Henderson Santa Fe New Mexico August 18 1922
