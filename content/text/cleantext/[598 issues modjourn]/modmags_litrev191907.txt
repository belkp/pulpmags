againIt was too late now even to go round to Kennett StreetFor good or ill she had spent New Year s Eve alone in a cold bedroomWhy could one not be sure whether it was good or badIt was only by sitting hour after hour letting one s fingers sewthat the evening had come to an endIt could not be wrong to make up one s mind to begin the new year with a long night s rest in a tidy room with everything mendedBut the feeling that the old year ought to be seen out with people had pricked all the time like conscienceIt only stopped pricking now because it was too lateAnd there was a sadness left in the eveningShe lifted her coat from her knees and stood upThe room shoneShe felt in her throat and nostrils the smell of dust coming from the floor and carpet and draperiesBut the bright light of the gas and the soft light of the reading lamp shone upon perfect orderEverything was mended and would presently be put away in tidy drawersShe was rested and strongundisturbed by the changes that would have come from social hoursNo one had missed herMany people scattered about in houses had thought of herIf they hadshe had been there with themShe could not be everywherewith all of themThat was certainThere was nothing to decide about herThe Brooms had missed her they would have enjoyed their new year s eve better if she had been thereIt would have been jolly to have gone again so soonafter the short half week and sat down by the fire where Christmas lingered and waited for the coming of the year with themIt would have been a loyalty to somethingBut it was too soon to be sitting about between comfortable mealstalkingexplaining thingsmaking life stop while you looked at it with time and things rushing along far awayOne still felt rested from Christmas and wanting to begin doing thingsPerhaps it was not altogether through undecided waiting that the evening had come and gone by here in this roomPerhaps it was some kind of decision that could not be seen or expressedNow that it had come to an end in solitudethere was realisationQuiet realisation of new year s evequiet realisation of new year s eveThe resolutions for the new life were still distinct in her mindShe found an exercise book and wrote them downThere they stoodpitting the calm steady innermost part of her against all her other selvesFree desperate obedience to them would bring a revelationNo matter how the other selves felt as she kept themif she kept them every moment of her life would go out from inward calm The room was full of clear strengthThere must always be a clear cold room to return toThere was no other way of keeping the inward peaceOutside one need do nothing but what was expected of oneasking nothing for oneself but freedom to return to the centreLife would be an endless inward singing until the end came in song and spring sunlightBut not too much inward singingspending one s strength in songthe song must be kept down and low so that it would last all the time and never failThen a song would answer back from outsidein everythingShe stepped lightly and powerfully about the room putting away her mended thingsOne would move like the wind alwaysa steady human south west wind alive and enliveningwithout personality or speechNo more booksBooks all led to the same thingThey were like talking about thingsAll the things in books were unfulfilled dutyNo more interest in menThey belonged to all the fuss and flurry of the worldWomen who had anything whatever to do with men were not themselvesThey were astray in a noisy confusionplaying a part all the timeThe only real misery in being alone was the fear of being left out of thingsIt was a wrong fearIt pushed you into things and then everything disappeared Not to listen outsidewhere there was nothing to hearIn the end you came away empty with time gone and lostTo rememberwhatever happenednot to be afraid of being aloneShe stood staring at the sheeny gaslit brown yellow varnish of the wall paper above the mantelpieceThere was no thought in her silenceno picture of past or futurenothing but the strange thing for which there were no wordssomething that was always there as if by appointmentwaiting for one to get through to it away from everything in lifeIt was the thing that was nothingYet it seemed the only thing that came near and meant anything at allIt was happiness and realisationIt was being suspendedin nothing It came out of oneself because it came only when one had been a long time aloneIt was not oneselfIt could not be GodIt did not mind what you were or what you had doneIt would be there if you had just murdered someone it was only there when you had murdered everybody and everything and torn yourself awayPerhaps it was evilOne s own evil geniusBut how could it make you so blissfulWhat was one what had one done to bring the feeling of goodness and beauty and truth into the patch on the wall and presently make all the look of the distant world and everything in one s experience sound like music in a dreamShe dropped her eyesFrom the papered wall radiance still seemed to flow over her as she stooddefining her brow and hairshedding a warmth in the cold roomLooking again she found the wall less brightbut within the radius of her motionless eyes everything in the brightly lit corner of the room glowed happilynot drawing her but standing complete and serenelike someone standing at a little distanceexpressing agreementa remark thrown over the shoulder before a departure that would in time loop back into a return Just in front of her a single neat warning tap sounded in the airtouching the quick of her mind StPan eras clockstriking down the chimneyshe ran across to the dark lattice and flung it openIn the air hung the echo of the first deep boom from WestminsterStPancras and the nearer clocks were telling themselves off against itThey would have finished long before Big Ben came to an endWhich was midnightLet it be StPancrasShe counted swiftly backwardsfour strokesOut in the darkness the dark world was turning away from darkness Within the spaces of the darkness she saw the spread of a landscapeFull daylight and early morning freshness gleamed together over itLittle sounds came snapping faintly up through the darkness from the street belowvoices and the creaking open of doorsWindows were being pushed open up and down the streetThe new year changed to a soft moonlit breath stealing through the darknessbrimming over the faces at the doors and windowstouching their brows with fingers of dawnsending fresh soothing healing fingers in amongst their hairEleventwelve Across the rushing scale of StPancras bells came a fearful clangourBicycle bellscab whistlesdinner bellsthe banging of tea trays and gongs of course New Year It must be a Bloornsfoury custom She had had her share in a Bloomsbury New YearRather jollyrowdybut jolly in that sort of way She could hear the Baileyslaughing and talking on their doorstepA smooth firm foreign voice flung out a shapely little fragment of songMiriam watched its outlineIt repeated itself in her mind with the foreign voice and personality of the singerShe drew back into her room2Her resolutions kept her at work on Saturday afternoonA steady morning s work disposed of the correspondence and the inrush of paid accountsAfter lunch she worked in the surgeries until they were ready for Monday morning and made an attack on the mass of clerical work that remained from the old yearShe sat working until she grew so cold that she knew if she stayed on in the cold window space she would have the beginning of a coldBetter to goand have late evenings every day next weekcheered by the protests of the Orlys and ending with warm hours in the denAs she got up and felt the aching of her throat and the harsh hot chill running through her nerves she realised that anyhow she was in for a coldThere was no room to go to get warm before going outThere seemed to be no warmth anywhere in the worldTorpid and stupidmiserably realising the increasing glow of her nose and the clumsy numbness of her feet she put away the ledgers and got into her outdoor thingsShe resented the sight of the bound volume of The Dental Cosmos that she had put aside to take homeHer interest in it was uselessas useless as everything else in the freezing worldSounds of dancing and chanting came up the basement stairsWhen their work was done they could laugh and sing in a warm roomTurning northwards toward the Marylebone Road she met a bleak wind and turned back and down Devonshire Street and eastwards towards StPancras through a maze of side streetsThe icy vind drove against her all the wayWhen she crossed a wide thoroughfare it was reinforced from the northEddies of colourless dust swirled about the pavementsAt every crossing in the many little side streets there was some big vehicle just upon her keeping her shrinking in the cold while it rumbled over the cobbles overwhelming her with a harsh grating roar that filled the streets and the skyDarkness was beginninga hard black January darknessutterly different to the friendly exciting twilights of the old yearStanding far far away with summer just behind them and Christmas aheadInside the house a cold grey twilight was blotting out the warm brownnessA door opened as she turned the stairhead on the second floor and a tall thin pale faced young man in dark clothes and a light waistcoat flashed past her and leaped lightly downstairs Miriam carried her impression up to her roomgoing hurriedly and stumbling on the stairs as she wentSomething hardmetalliclike a wire springcold and relentlessBelonging to a cold dreadful darkness and not knowing itconfidentHe had whistled going downstairsor sungHad hePerhaps he was the foreignerwho had sung last nightPerfectly and awfully dreadfulThe whole house and even her own room had been changed in a twinklingComing in it had had a warmth even in the cold twilightNow it lay open and bleakall its rooms naked and visiblea houseforeign young gentlemenheard of and came to live inHe must be of theNorwegian young gentlemenwho had lived in MrsReynold s boarding house in Woburn Place and this was just another boarding house to himPerhaps the house was full of boardersShe had grown accustomed to the Baileys having come up from the basement to the ground floor and had got into the habit of coming briskly through the hall with a preoccupied mannerignoring the invariable appearance of a peeping form at the partly opened door of the dining roomIt was strange now to reflect that the house had always been full of lodgersWhat sort of people had they beenShe could not remember ever having met a lodger face to faceor heard any sounds of their occupation of the many downstairs rooms perhaps it had been partly through going out so early and coming back only when the ABCclosed and being out or away so much at week ends but also she must have been obliviousThe house had been her ownwaiting for her when she found itthe quiet road of large high grey mysterious housesthe two rows of calm balconied facadesthe green squares at either endthe green door she waited for as she turned unseeing into the road from the quiet thoroughfare of Endsleigh Gardensher triumphant faithful latchkeythe sheltered dimness of the hallthe great staircasethe many large closed doorsthe lonely obscurity of her empty top floorWhat had come now was the fulfillment of the apprehension she had had when MrsBailey had spoken the word boardersHere they wereThey would come and go and go up and downstairs from their bedrooms to that dining room where the disturbing disclosure had been made and the unknown drawing room Perhaps it would be a failureShe could not imagine MrsBailey and the two vague furitive children in skimpy blue serge dresses dealing with the young Norwegian gentlemanHe would not stayIf boarders failed MrsBailey might give up the house altogether She found herself sitting in her outdoor things with the large volume heavy on her knees in the middle of the room She felt too languid and miserable to get up and take the small chair and the large book to the table and began wretchedly turning the pages with her gloved handsHere it wasShe glanced through the long article reading passages here and thereThere seemed to be nothing moreshe had gathered the gist of it all in glancing through it at Wimpole StreetThere was no need to have brought it homeIt was quite clear that she belonged to the lymphatieo nervous classIt was the worst of the four classes of humanityBut all the symptoms were hers She read once more the account of the nervo biilous typeIt was impossible to fit into thatThose people were dark and sanguine and energeticIt was very strangeHaving bilious attacks and not having the advantages of the bilious temperamentIt meant having the worst of everythingNo energy no initiative no hopefulness no resisting powerand sometimes bilious attacksShe was uselessan encumbranceleft out of life foreverbecause it was better for life to leave her outshe sat staring at the shabby panels of her wardrobehating them for their quiet merciless agreement with her thoughtsTo stop now and come to an end would be a reliefBut there was nothing anywhere that would come in and end herWhy did life produce people with lymphatieo nervous temperamentsPerhaps it was the explanation of all she had suffered in the pastof the things that had driven her again and again to go away and awayanywhereShe wrenched herself away from her thoughts and flung forward to the sense of sunshinesudden beautiful thingsunreasonable secret happinesswaiting somewhere beyond the blacknessto come againBut it would mean to take themShe brought nothing to anybodyShe had no right to anythingShe ought to be branded and go about in a cloakThere was no one in the world who would care if she never appeared anywhere againShe sat shrinking before this thoughtIt was the plain and simple truthNothing that any kind and cheerful person might say could alter itIt would only make it worseShe wondered that she had never put it to herself beforeIt must always have been there since her mother s deathThere were one or two people who thought they caredBut they only cared because they did not knowIf they saw more of her they would cease even to think they caredand they had their own lives She had gone on being happy exactly in the same way as she had forgotten there were people in the housejust going lymphatico nervously about with her eyes shutBut any alternative was worseInsincereIf one could not die one must go dragging onkeeping oneself to oneselfThat was why it was a relief to be in Londonsurrounded by people who did not know what one was really likeSocial lifeany sort of social life anywhere would not helpIt only made it worseBeing like this was not a morbid state due to the lack of cheerful societyPeople who said that were wrongThe sign that they were wrong was the way they went about being deliberately cheerful and sociableThat was worse than anythingthe refusal to face the truthBut at least they could endure peopleIf one could not endure anyone one ought to be deadto sit staring in front of one until one was dead the wardrobe did not disagreeShe averted her eyes as if from an observerThey fell upon her hopeless person dressed in the clothes in which she moved about in the worldShe was bitterly coldBut she sat on unable to summon courage to turn and face her roomHer eyes wandered vacantly back to the panels and down to the drawer below them and back againThe warm quiet booming of a gong came up through the houseShe got to her feet and stood listening in amazementMrsBailey had insti tuted a boarding house gongShe went out on to the landingthe gong ceased and rattled gently against its framework released from hands that had stilled its reverberationA voice sounded in the hall and then the dining room door closed and there was silenceThey were having teaOf courseevery daylife going on down there in the dining roomInvoluntarily her feet were on the stairsShe went down the narrow flight holding to the balustrade to steady the stumbling of her benumbed limbsWhat was she doingGoing down to MrsBaileygoing to stand for a moment close by MrsBailey s tea trayNoimpossible to let the Baileys save herhaving done nothing for herselfImpossible to be beholden to the Baileys for anythingRestoration by them would be restoration to shameShe had moved unconsciouslyHer life was still her own She was in the worldin a housegoing down some stairsFor the present the pretence of living could go onShe could not go back to her roomnor forward to any other roomShe pushed blindly on a bitter anger growing within herShe had moved towards the BaileysIt was irrevocableShe had departed from all her precedentsShe would always know itWherever she found herself it would always be there at the root of her consciousnessshaming hershowing in everything she did or saidHalf way downstairs she restrained her heavy movements and began to go swiftly and stealthilyMeanmeanmeanutterly mean and damneda sneaking evil spiritShe pulled herself upright and cleared her throat in a business like wayThe echo of Harriett s voice in her voice plumbed her for tearsBut there were no tearsOnly something close round her that moulded her face in lines of despairThe hall was in sightShe was going down to the hall to look for letters on the hall table and go backShe paused in the hallIf the dining room opened she would kill someone with a cold blind glance and go angrily on and out of the front doorIf it did not openIt remained closedIt was not going to openIt came quietly wide as if someone had been waiting behind it with the handle turnedMrsBailey was in the hall with a firm little hand on her armWellyoung lady Miriam turned full round shrinking backwards towards the hall tableMrsBailey was clutching her hands Won t you come in and have a cup of teaI can t whispered Miriam briskymoving towards the dining room doorI ve got to go out she murmuredstanding just inside the open doorGoing outasked MrsBailey in a refined little voice throwing a prbud fond shy glance towards Miriam from her recovered place behind the tea trayHer cheeks were flushed and her eyes sparkled brightly under the gaslightMiriam s glance elastic in the warmth coming from the room swept from the flood of yellow hair on the back of the youngest Bailey girl sittingclose at her mother s left handacross to the far side of the tableThe pale grey blue eyes of the eldest Bailey girl were directed towards the bread and butter her hand was stretched out to take with the unseeing look they must have had when she had turned her face towards the doorAt her side between her and her mother sat the young Norwegian gentlemana dark blue upright form with a narrow gold bar set aslant in the soft mass of black silk tie bulging about the uncreased flatness of his length of grey waist coatHe had reared his head smoothly upright and a smooth metallic glance had slid across her from large dark clear easily opened eyesHe was very youngabout twentythe leanness of his dart like perfectly clad form led slenderly up to a lean distinguished headBut above the wide high pale brow where the bone stared squarely through the skin and was beaten in at the temples the skull had a snakelike flatnessthe polished hair was poor and worn and the glance of the eyes was the glittering glance of a serpentYesmurmured Miriam abstractedlyI m just going outDon t catch cold young ladysmiled MrsBaileyOlh wellI ll trv not tosaid Miriam departingThey ll never do itshe told herself as she made her way through the darkness towards her A B Cin the Tottenham Court RoadHe ll find outHe thinks he is learning English in an English family3MrsBailey came up herself to do Miriam s room on Sunday morningMiriam wondered as she came archly in after a brisk tap on the door how she knew that her visit caused dismayThe visit of the little imaid did not break into anythingIt only meant standing for a minute or so by the window longing for the snuffling and shuffling to be overBut if MrsBailey were coming up every Sunday morningShe stood at MrsBailey s disposal sheepishly smilingin the middle of the roomYou didn t expect to see meyoung lady Miriam broadened her smileI want to talk to youThey stood confronted in the room just as they had done the first time MrsBailey had been there with her and they had settled about the rentOnly that then the room had seemed large and real and at once inhabitedthe crown of the large house and the reality of all the unknown roomsNow it seemed to be at a disadvantageone of MrsBailey s unconsidered atticsapart from the life that was beginning to flow all around her downstairsSomething in MrsBailey s face when she said I was wondering if you would give Sissie a few French lessons spoke the energy of the new feeling and thoughtMiriam was astoundedShe called up a vision of Sis sie s pale steady grey blue eyesher characterless hairher thickset swiftly ambling little figureShe was the kind of girl who after good schooling could spend a year in France and come back unable to speak FrenchBut if MrsBailey wished it she would have to learnfrom somebody So she conspired with an easy contemptuous conscience and they stood murmuring over the planMrsBailey producing one by onefearfullyin a low motherly encouraging tone the things she had arranged beforehand in her own mindBefore she went she bustled to the window and tweaked the ends of the little Madras muslin curtainsWhy don t you go down to the dron room for a while she asked tweaking and flicking You ll have it all to yourselfMrElsing s gone outI should go down if I was you and get a warm upMiriam thanked her and promised to go and wondered whether the Norwegian s name was Helsing or ElsenWhen MrsBailey had gone she walked busily about her affronted roomIt must be HelsingA man named Elsen would be shorter and stouter and kindlyOf course she would not go down to the drawing roomShe ransacked her Saratoga trunk and found a Havet and phrase bookShe would teach Sissie the rules of French pronunciation and two or three phrases every day and make some sort of beginning of syntax with HavetThere would be no difficulty in filling up the quarter of an hourBut it would be teaching in the bad cruel old fashioned wayTo begin at once with Piccola or Le Roi des Montagnes and talk to her in the character of a Frenchman wanting to become a boarder would be the bestBut Sissie would not grasp that slow wayIt would be too long before she began to see that she was learning anything But the smattering of phrases and rules from a book handed outwithout any trouble to herself on her way to her room and before she wanted to go out was too little to give in exchange for a proper breakfast ready for her in a warm room every day and the option of having single meals at any time for a very small sumBecause the Baileys were trying to turn themselves into an English family prepared to receive foreigners who wanted to learn Englishand she had promised the lessons as if she thought the plan good She crept downstairs through the silent empty housepausing at the open drawing room door to listen to the faint far away subterranean sounds coming from the kitchenAll the furniture seemed to be waiting for someone or somethingThat was a console tableShe must have noticed the jar on it as she came into the roomor somewhere elseit looked so familiarOne ought to know the name of the material it was made ofIt was like a coarse veined agateIn the narrow strip of mirror that ran from the table high up the wall between the two french windows stood the heavy self conscious reflection of the elegant jugIt was elegant and completethe heavy minutely moulded flowers and leaves festooned about its tapering curves did not destroy its eleganceIt stood out alone and complete against the reflected strip of shabby roomExtraordinaryWhere had it come fromIt was an imitation of somethingA reflection of some other lifeHad it ever been seen by anybody who knew the kind of life it was meant to be surrounded byShe backed into an obstacle and turned with her hand upon the low velvet back of a little circular chairIts narrow circular strip of back was supported by little wooden pillarsShe took possession of itThe coiled spring of the seat showed its humpy outline through the velvet and gave way crookedly under her when she sat downBut she felt she was in her place in the roomout amongst its strange spacesIn front of her about the fireside were two large armchairs upholstered in shabby Utrecht velvet and a wicker chair with a woolwork cushion on its seat and a dingy antimacassar worked in crewels thrown over its high backTo her right stood a small battered three tiered lacquer and bamboo tea tableand beyond it a large circular table polished and inlaid and strewn with dingy books occupied the end of the room between the fireplace and the wallOn the other side of the fireplace stood a chiffonier in black wood supporting and reflecting in its little mirror a large square deeply carved dusty brown wooden box inlaid with mother of pearlCrowding agianst the chiffonier was a large shabby bamboo tea table and a scatter of velvet seated drawhig room chairs with carved dusty abruptly curving backs and legsAway to the left rose one of the high french windowsThe dingy cream lace curtains almost meeting across itwent up and up from the dusty floor and ended high upunder a red woollen valence running along a heavy gilt cornice Between the curtains she could cafch a glimpse of the balcony railings and strips between them of the brown brickwork of the opposite houseShe stared at the vague scatter of vases and bowls and small ornaments standing in front of the large overmantel and dimly reflected in its dusty mirrorTwo tall vases on the mantelshelf holding dried grasses carried her eyes up to two short vases holding dried grasses and standing on the wooden pillared brackets of the overmantelback again tothemselvesShe rose and turned away to shake off their influence and turned back again at once to see what had atract ed her attentionSatsumaat either end of the mantelpiece shutting in the scatter of vases and bowls two large squat rounded Satsuma basins with arched lidsOn the centre of each lid was a little gilded knobExtraordinaryUnlike any Satsuma she had ever seenWhere had they come fromShe wandered about the roomeagerly taking in battered chairs and more little tables and whatnots and faded pictures on the faded wallsWhat was it that had risen in her mind as she came into the roomShe recalled the moment of coming inThe pianothe quiet shock of it standing there with the shut inwaiting look of a pianoconfronting the large stillness of the roomTurning to face it she passed into the world of drawing room pianosthe rosewood casethe faded rose silk pleating strained tautits margind hidden under a rosewood trellisthe little tarnished sconcesfor shaded candlesthe small leather easily twirling stool with its single thick deeply carved lega lady sittingtwinklingflourishing delicately through airs with variationsan English pianoperfectly wrought and finishedmusic swathed and hidden in elegance a little musicbut chiefly of the seated formthe small cooped bodythe voluminous draperies bulging over the stool and spreading in under the keyboard and down about the floorthe elegantly straying arms and mincing handsthe arch swaying of the head and shouldersthe face bent delicately in the becoming play of lightShe opened the lidIt went back from the keys till it lay flatpresenting a little music stand folded into the sweep of its upper edgeMustiness rosefrom the keysThey were loose and yellow with ageSoftly struck notes shattered the silence of the roomShe stood listening with loudly beating heartThe door would open and show a lace with surprised eyes staring into her betrayed consciousnessThe house remained silentHer fingers strayed forward and ran up a scaleThe notes were all run down but they rang fairly true to each otherMoskowski s Serenade sounded fearfully patheticas if the piano were heart brokenIt could be made to do betterBoth the pedals workedthe soft one producing a woolly sweetnessthe loud a metallic shallow brilliance of toneShe shut the heavy softly closing loose handled door very carefullyIts cold china knob told her callously that her real place was in the little room upstairs with the bedroom crockery cold in the mid morning lightBut she had already shut the doorShe came shyly back to the piano and sat down and played carefully and obediently piece after piece remembered from her schooldaysThey left the room triumphantly silent and heavy all round herIf she got up and went away it would be as if she had not played at allShe could not sit here playing ChopinIt would be like deliberately speaking a foreign language suddenlyto assert yourselfPlaying pianissimo she slowly traced a few phrases of a nocturneThey revealed all the flat dejection of the registerWith the soft pedal down she pressed out the notes in vain attempt to key them upThrough their mournful sagging the magic shape came out She could not stay her handsPresently she no longer heard the false tonesThe notes sounded soft and clear and true into her mind weaving and interweaving their familiar reverie of moonlit watersthe sound of summer leaves flickering in the darknessthe trailing of dusk across misty meadowsthe stealing of dawn over grassthe faint vision of the Taj Mahal set in dark treeswhite Indian moonlight outlining the trees and pouring over the pale facadeover all a hovering haunting consoling voice pure and clearpassing as the pictufes faintly came and cleared and melted and changed upon a vast soft darknesslike a silver thread through everything in the worldClosing in upon her from the schoolgirl pieces still echoing in the room came sudden abrupt little scenes from all the levels of her lifedeep rooted moments still alive within her challenging and promising as when she had left themdriven relentlessly on The last chord of the nocturne brought the room sharply backIt was unchangedlifeless and unmovednothing had passed to it from the little circle where she sat enclosedHer heart swelled and tears rose in her eyesThe room was old and experiencedfull like her inmost mind of the unchanging pastNothing in her life had any meaning for itIt waited impassively for the passing to and fro of people who would leave no impressionShe had exposed herself and it meant nothing in the roomLife had passed her by and her playing had become a sentimental exhibition of unneeded life She was wretched and feeble and tiredLife has passed me bythat is the truthI am no longer a personMy playing would be the nauseating record of an uninteresting failure to people who have lived or a pandering to the sentimental memories of people whoim life has passed by you played that like a snail crossed in love perhaps he was rightBut something had gone wrong because played with the intention of commenting on Alma s way of playing That was not allIt did not end thereThere was something in music when one played alonewithout thoughtsSomething presentand newNot affected by life or by any kind of peopleIn BeethovenBeethoven was the answer to the silence of the roomShe imagined a sonata ringing out into itand defiantly attacked a remembered fragmentIt crashed into the silenceThe uncaring room might rock and swayIts rickety furniture shatter to bitsSomething must happen under the outbreak of her best realityShe was on firm groundThe room was nowhereShe cast sidelong half fearful exultant glancesThe room woke into an affronted silenceShe felt astonishment at the sudden loud outbreak of assertions turning to scornful disgustEntrenched behind the disgust something was declaring that she had no right to her understanding of musicno business to get away into it and hide her defectsto get out of things and escape the proper exposure of her failureIn a man it would have been excusableThe room would have listened with respectful flattering indulgent tolerance till it was over and then have relapsed untouchedThis dingy woman playing with the directness and decision of a man was like some strange beast in the room It was too late to go ba ckShe could only rush on re affirming her assertionshouting in a din that must be reaching up and down the house and echoing out into the street the thing that was stronger than the feeling that had prompted her appeal for sympathyIt was the everlasting parting of the waysthewrenching away that always cameThe Baileys were going on downstairs with their planningthe Norwegian busy with his cold watchful grappling with Englandall of them far awayfloutedThe room became a background indistinguishable from any other indifferent backgroundAll round her was height and deptha sense of vast ness and grandeur beyond anything to be seen or heardyet stretching back like a sheltering wing over the past to her earliest memories and forward ahead out of sightThe piano had changedIt came out a depth and dignity of toneBy careful management she could avoid the abrupt contrast between the action of the pedalsPresently the glowing and aching of the muscles of her forearms forced her to leave offShe swung roundThe forgotten room was filled with friendly lightTriumphant echoes filled its wide spacespressed gainst the windowsfiltered out into the quiet street out and away into LondonWhen the room was still there was an unbroken stillness in the house and the streetStriking thinly across it came the tones of the solitary unaccompanied violin to be continued POEMS by HHBellamann Derriere L Echo Regnier wrote of youYou are that one who stands behind the echoYour hair Is like a gold wind My heart dances the inescapable bacchanalia Of spring You nod to me over the cash register And straighten the jonquils on your georgette waist As I leave the restaurant It was jonquils made me think of RegnierThere is sleet on the pavement outsideThe Dancer in the Mirror Your eyes are green mirrors of Venetian glassThey remember pageants And festivalsI can see transparent shapes pass there Dressed in brocadelaced with pearlsI can see tall poplar trees And blue mantled equerries on white horses There is always a little dancer in the green mirrors Who dances out of timeThe dancer is a dwarf Like that one Velasquez painted With the InfantaAtavistic You stand under a Yiddish sign Listening to an automatic piano That rattles in the arch of a cinema entranceYou sway from the hipsThe king s eyes glaze And the courtiers stir uneasily Your white body curves in a fringed and glittering mistIts slow bending concavities Elicit sharp drawn breathsThe revolving electric sign scatters ruby and emerald lights over your small head and into your gold brown eyesGarden Corner Three white peacocksIdleelegantpoisedStroll beneath the pagoda shape Of a Himalayan firThey are sereneTheir jewelled heads Are regalChrysanthemumsLike neighborschildrenWith curiosity on their facesPeep over the box hedges And listenBut they cannot understand What the peacocks sayInto this retreat Where philosophy and fashion Meet in delicate conversationComes a sudden flirt of blueGesture of self assurance A flood of common talkChatterAnd slangA Gascon jay With a cocksure eye And a loud loose tongue And a mockingarrogant airLaughs at fashionAnd hoots at learningAnd boasts of the leagues he s traveledHe jeers at reposeAnd sneers at foesAnd hopes the world will learn That those who talkAnd those who walk In shady old places like thisMake a very small stir And are never known Outside a garden wallHe s witty and boldBut his glance is coldAnd he sprinkles his talk With some very bad wordsA Gascon jay With a cock sure eye And a flood of comimon talkThree peacocks turn enquiring eyes In haughty wondering glancesBut they do not understandFor they only speak in Old Chinese Ancientpureand correct ChineseSo the gibes and jokes And the modern slang Of a gascon minded jayAre lost on ears That only know Chinese Ancientpureand correct ChineseThe loud street laughs At the loose tongued jayHis jests And his very bad wordsBut three jeweled headsIn conscious prideNod in grave and assured assent As

successfully in men s clubs than it is supposed to have been in the woman governed salons of Fmnce in the 17th18thand early igth centuriesIn those days the presence of woman proved we have always believed as active a stimulant to the exercise of conversation as that other undeniably useful stimulant whose beneficial influence is acknowledged by MrYeatsBut since there seems to have been little

those who would destroy you that I am saying my little say hereinShall I begin by asking a questionIs anything added to the minute aggregate of beauty in the world by sneering at the multitude and boasting of a self acclaimed mystical insight into the secret shrine of artSurely you do not feel that spiritual bastinadoing will open the soul of the aesthetically recalcitrantEven were it possiblewould it be justifiable to whip mankind to cultural salvationYou recognizefor I have heard you say sothat beauty need lay no eeige to the heart of the true artistIt is an authentic case of

aesthetically recalcitrantI have tried tobeing of the ecclesiastical typeBut I must beg exemption from your verbsneer I have not sneeredThe sneer is one of the finest things in natureand a weapon of incomparable effectI have not achieved itMCA The Poet of Maine by Marsden Hartley THIRTYSEVEN years ago a tidal wave washed up on the shores of Maine a titanIt left him sitting on a rockand never returnedInstead of a rock to sit uponthe whim of the world changed rock to piano stooland for the last eighteen years or more said titan has been drumming out everything ever written for piano that could be transcribed or multilated for movie purposesfrom silver threads among the goldgoodbye summeron down to the last march or aria in the field of operaSix hours a day on a piano stool for eighteen years is not exactly the most inspiring occupation for a poetmuch less for a man of powerful imaginationwith the tension of a Balzac in his brainWallace Gould is the titan the sea brought upand it left him pondering on a shore that he understands now so perfectlyhardly ever having left itas to make him truthfully the voice of Maine in modern poetryThe promising Seven Arts of two years ago which perished certainly too soon to show what it could dobrought out the first printing of a series of poetic pieces of this original poetI met Waldo Frank on Fifth Avenue one day at the time the Seven Arts was flourishingWaldo queried Marsdencan t you help find us some new poets for our magazine I replied I happen to know a genuine one at this moment who has waited yearsand still waits for the proper chance to appear I gave the addressand the Seven Arts published five pieces from Wallace Gould s first book The Children of the Sun Braithwaite of Boston wrote Gould to ask for permission to reprint him in his Anthology of poetry for that periodand also at the same time the Cornhill Publishing Cosought him out with a view to publication If you publishyou do so entirely at your own risk replied GouldThey were eager apparentlyandThe Children of the Sunmade its appearance duly in flagrant orange boards with black buckram backIt was reviewed lengthily by Braithwaite in the Boston Transcriptand a few minor issues gave it scant attentionmostly to sneer or condemnwith a faint smattering of praisePossibly the book had faultsbut the faults did not lie in the quality The Boston Shops subscribed for a few copiesand one dealer ordered twenty five copies and in a week s time returned them saying the book was decidedly too flagrantly of the sunthat it was too indecentor something of that sortOther retailers quietly cancelled their ordersAnd the titan sits upon a rock stillwith not even a leaking ferryboat to get him to shoremuch less a solid shipas it ought to beWallace Gould sits on his piano stool drumming for an existenceand after the labours of eighteen yearsfor Gould has been a merciless pruner of his pieceshis second book The Drift of a Year lies ready for considerationor possible neglectThis has happened before in Maineto that other and very distinguished poetEdwin Arlington Robinsonso the poets from Maine are ironically trained to the habit of neglectDuring the last year or so several reviews have been on the waybut nothing has quite come offowing to illness or the pressure of eventsand the matter of making Gould known outside of his printed work has been inadvertently deferredThe titan sits upon a rock and waits for the tidal wave of deliverance to come and show him something besides a piano and a reel of movie with the background of the solemnity of Maine as the clue to human experienceAt present Gould is playing piano in the mill town of MadisonMaineon the banks of the majestic Kennebec RiverHe draws all of his material naturally from the mountainslakesriversrockstidesskiesand ocean movements of MaineHe is therefore literally the poet of Maineas well as its first modern voice in poetryWe allow here for Robinson whois one of the best poets America has so far producedwe all of us know the plight of his existenceand know that but for the few discerning poets and friends of his nineand the efforts at a later time of Theodore Roosevelthe might still be suspended in the limbo of neglectBut Robinson is not Maine in precisely the sense that Gould is Mainefor Robinson made a stiff abstraction out of itwhile Gould has given the flavour of the place and the characteristics of the place with a poetic fidelity that might be called by some rough realismbut it is a realism that is in no sense photographyIt is rather the life of things and people and places in Mainethe life of Maine as it isunchangeduntransmutedGould knows the state in the actual sense as Nero knew his RomeHe possesses itand presents accuracy of substance with a fine virility of handlingHe is behind every shade of its significanceits majestyits dramatic brillianceits queer humoursand its fine fantasyas well as its historyI am myself a native of Mainethough having lived there but little in the sense of nativeyet I know the degree in which Gould has produced his valuesHis methods may be quarreled withI suppose the eclectics would find Gould this or that impossibleand the others would find him this or that brutish or flagrantor lacking in sentimental delicaciesWellit s rugged poetryand there is the differenceIt is the poetry of a titan on a rock with the salt spray still on his flanksand with mountain winds and the rush of great rivers around himthe terror of the silences of deep woodsand the thunder rumbling in his hairWhen Gould talks of the seasonsthey are the seasons of Maineand when he talks of events they are the events of MaineHe is Maine inside and out in his poetryNo state has ever been so voiced in poetry as Maine is voiced in the work of Wallace GouldThere is lyric beauty in all of Gould s poems and rhapsodiesand there is dramatic intensity born out of a fierce simplicityand there is most of all a fine grip of the substance around himIf you want to get the flavour of Maineyou shall find it in the poetry of Wallace GouldFrost is of New Hampshireand that is New Englandand it is New England with poetic vengeanceThis is argument only for the virile sense of place that underlies the work of modern poetsor at least the best of themGould must be counted among the very best poets of America today by virtue of his personal distinctionand by the feeling for his own specific soiland his work will bear him out to the endThe endhoweverno one worried aboutor the beginningfor that matterIt s the deadly middle ground upon which everything is fought out that distracts and boresand nauseatesIf Gould s poetic pieceOut of Seasonis the moral eyesore in theChildren of the Sun if it is too much for polite and virtuous eyesand if it is too much for Boston to sein print thatbuttons is a castrated torn what happens with theChildren of Adam or do people draw the jalousie when they want to read section nine of that tgroup inLeaves of Grass and pull up the blind again onCaptainmy captain I am amused and delighted when I hear of one individual who went traveling for the recovery of health and took as diversion the bible and a copy of RabelaisBut real books are read by real peopleand I am certain there are more threadbare volumes of the fascinating wit of this french geniusthan there are of the bibleAt least Rabelais is closer to the average human experienceAnd so the adorably immoral city of Boston had to give back Wallace Gould s orange book because it was too filled with things in universal sunlightThe exposure is too much for the so highly respected violet glass windows of the best families of State House hillIt couldn t have a book with lines telling of performing duties which make men shudder the dressingthe washingthe feedingAnd other things which make men shudder People are shuddering at James Joyce nowJoyce speaks of unmentionable loves inExilesI beliveI suppose Joyce has unfolded the lily too farGould has the dagger well in handand doesn t hate to use it to rip up the sleek laowels of natureI expectThe Drift of a Yearwill be hailed as an interesting book by someSo it isIt will not be shut by Boston for Boston is too near MaineIt may not even be opened by Bostonbut there s Chicagoand there s the rest of the worldI hear the Gould is being spoken of across the water tjo the french modernsLets hope the frenchmen find a go that sounds like virility and American originalityMeanwhile Gould sits strumming everything from Over ThereOver Thereto the Meditation fromThaisand beyond to anything that would suit the exquisite pantomine of Charles Chaplin or Tom Mixor the sadly passing WmSHartWith Gould s two hundred and eighty pounds averdupois and most of it in his brainhe at least crowns his six feet two with the intelligence one might expect of a titan washed up on a tidal waveGould is of the big school of SandBalzacand Byron in his en thusiamsand wonders if the world will ever see such masters againGould was born out of placegeographically speakingHe needs a Russiaor an Egypt or earlier times for his playgroundHe needs a Paris of the Louis s and an Italy of the Borgias and of CelliniHe is wasting large material on small spaces for lack of room to make titantic gestures He has been tied toMaine by circumstanceNature does all sorts of things to moles and mastodonsNow and then it sets one freeGould has the power but not the spacePiano stools are trivial in the long runBut there isThe Drift of a Yearjust ready and somewhat in printand there areKennebec Portraitsand dramatic projects on the wayMaine at least has its original poetGould will not rhyme you to deathand he will not exalt you to extinction with tritenessHe may nauseate you with his vitalityYou shall take your chance with Wallace GouldYou can tseehim first and hear him afterwardHe must be listened toor given upHe doesn t inspireHe demands I print this article as a good example of what passes for criticism in AmericaMrHartley has simply made up words about Wallace GouldAlmost nothing that Gould has written justifies any of MrHartley s praiseWallace Gould is a writer who has not yet learned to writeI have seen a few of his newer prose things and they are betterthey show Wallace Gould at that point in his development where he can select what may be called significant materialand in this respect they bear out MrHartley s idea of Gould as a significant human beingBut this fact is not necessarilly followed by the conclusion that he has grasped his material as an artist MCA POEMS by Wallace Gould 22I send these violetsMadamefor you to wear upon your breastI send these violetsMadamewithout

towndilettanteconnoisseurbookmanand Secretary to the Admiralty of Charles Secondis usually taken to be the prince of diaristsBut across the British Channel there is another whose diary if and when it is ever publishedin selectionswill befound to stand very close alongsideMrPeeps as his contemporaries called himIndeed in some things he is surpassed by the surprising wealth of detailsif not by the meticulous care the French diarist tookafter the laboursand the jestsand the news tellingsand the eatings and drinkings and gallantries of each day and nightto write up his most voluminous tell taleHis work has been described asun des monuments les plus etran ges de la manie humaine and it is certainly ail that and moreBefore it could appear to the public eye it would require a much more drastic expurgation than even the Memoirs of Jacques Casanova and others of that ilkfor much of Henri Legrand s diary deals withhistoire des fernmes que j ai connues But thenLegrand moved in the highest circles at a time when women made history in FranceHis dairy was rescued some forty years ago from a bookseller s stall on the Quai Voltaireand consists of a manuscript in forty five volumes written apparently in Oriental charactersFor some time it puzzled manyboth as to contents and writeruntilon the cipher being decoded at lastit was found to be the diary of one Henri Legrandan architectborn in France of a good family in 1814and married at Madrid in 1847 to an illegitimate daughter of the third Earl of ClarendonFrom 1835 and for thirty years onward Legrand reports in his diary everything that happens to himand deals minutely with great events in FranceHe not only outdoes Pepys in voluminousness but also in minuteness and abundance of detailHe throws light on wellknown and notorious facts and namesand transcribes certificates of birthmarriagedeathofficial papersand passportsEvery document or letter is fully commented ontogether with description of sealspostal marksand stampsthe writing and paperNothing escapes Legrand s attentionVery handsomeand with a deep knowledge of occultismhe was a favourite in Government circles and the best society in Parisand made full use of his opportunities for commitment to his diary He had a liaison with a young lady of one of the great historic French familiesand her confidences supplied him with intimate stories and all the scandalmost circumstantially relatedof the courts of Louis PhillipeIsabella Secondand the Tuileries under Napoleon ThirdShe not only wrote most fully and confidentially to him but allowed him to read her friendslettersand some 10 000 of them are to be foundcopied in full into the diaryIn it also are faithful transcriptions of numerous documents bearing on the secret history of the middle of the nineteenth century which the fires of the Paris Communists so effectually destroyedand much other matter throwing light upon apparent mysteriesThe cipher Legrand used has been stated to be comparatively simplebut to add to outsidersdifficulties in reading it he multiplied its intricacies by often writing in three languagesand his handwriting is small almost to minutenessAs another obstacle in the way of elucidationLegrandthough he wrote to be read from left to rightran the letters of each word from right to leftButthe French Pepys also has had to render up his secretsand in one
