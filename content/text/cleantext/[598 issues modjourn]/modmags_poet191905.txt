housetops Earth s prophet through whom the Almighty chanted His  works Walt Walt Up there Do you hear us hallooing to you  Out of stinking alleys Out of gutters and dead fields Out of the eternal monotony of the factories From all abominable trades and places Swarms an egregious horde Speaking all tongues they come Singing new songs and loving and praying And mauling and being mauled And pushed down under the slime and bursting out to the  heavens   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  We do not know them We futile men in white collars do not know them  Walt Walt You burly old lover of men and women Can t you get a furlough Stop shouting above the noise of the harps Loose your arm from Abe Lincoln s And come down  Eat with this horde Walt And laugh with them And weep with them Then come forth chanting You prophet and diviner You lover and seer of men Find for us the perfume of their stench Shout forth the beauty of their dreams Translate their hundred tongues Come Walt Come John Russell McCarthy  WALT WHITMAN  Noon on the mountain And all the crags are husky faces powerful with love for  the sun All the shadows Whisper of the sun Emanuel Carnevali   THE SHIP S PROW  Standing out as from the confusion Of dark masses ebbing and flowing In surging wastes on all sides I saw the signal figure of a man Standing as though On the moving forepoint of a ship A sea going dragon like monster ship Always I saw this man figure The ship s prow was always in the picture And the sea blue and continent Swept its silhouette beyond and around him But I had my soul s knapsack strapped on Ready for the brave climb After the far flung bloomy mass That fringes every woman s sky line And so I passed by the ship s prow And its picture of power  O wooing Wonder of Life You cast your spell upon me You swept over me with shivers of frightened delight And made every leaf and crevice Turn into a fairy hiding place and brownie fane You egged the trees to follow me And brought them to a standstill When I turned and caught them You taught the bluffs and hills   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  To kneel and offer their breasts to me With spiring cyclones and flooding gullies You whirled me out into the world floods  O wooing Wonder of Life Your spirit of adventure pushed me You rushed me with hot deeds For humanity that workshop where ever must Young talent whittle itself into shape Where the only hindrance is the crawling hour of youth And oh how I chafed like the steed of some boy Galahad Begging to be unleashed from the plow of Time  But somehow I escaped you O wooing Wonder of Life For another wonder wooed me Always this massive figure of the man indeed Face outward toward the limitless Stood ready for the subduing leap into the blue Filling me with terror lest he take it  One restless morning Something made contact And the voiceless one broke into quiet words As though those words had called To my heart s Sesame A great wall lifted And I found myself behind it shaking Like a lily that had nestled unwisely   A roistering bee And then something was stolen Something that had swapped my honey for a bitter dew  What had toppled What was broken What had been committed what wrong done To the trust and charge that had been softly Handed through the gate When birth had kept its tryst with me  There came a rust gray swamp before me Where once the drowsy blueness of the day Had lured me out into the shimmering mirage That I had called my work Moonlights of promise and longing Which had been opal before Turned to bronze brown glare The warm rose of the cloud edges Of my daily doings shone off into a slimy silver void Haloes that had beckoned me to wear them Fell into shivered icicles Roses I had reached for now were rags and sticks Songs that had called me to dizzy heights Now tripped off in silly jingles Stories that had hungered me with plot power died Garments that had helped me feel beauty and freedom Fell as tatters and I felt cold and naked For I saw my primal self swung orbit Against the zenith of the myriad   My solitary life against the solitary figure On the ship s prow With the whole sea to rest its shadow  Then the shadow of the sea flooded from my eyes And as though the whole of my future Had gulped me in I stood there completed yet rebelling Lost in a boundless forest main For I realized his as a life that had the contour Of the spreading prodigal English oak With a soul aspiring as the top shoot Of a Norwegian fir tapping the sky for space With a fantasy complex as the cypresses of Lebanon With a power to structure itself Even as Lebanon s blossomed into building For a temple ridden race which bore David In its lute slumbering womb   His ear and throat made the memory Long for an hour to prowl In the nightingale haunted terraces Of the Black Forest pines Where mix the scents of wine and resin And again like Lebanon s planks There was laid in him an everlasting sounding board Against which the mighty resonance Of a choral heart might throw itself in song And sing as the Jehovah mad Jew has sung to the ages   A song which ever after mocked the little gods As his melody since has mocked my littleness   His stern resolves were as the unfaltering spheres That endless forward backward thread their silver paths Without a time keeper or a score line Since some paternal force inhibiting Has seeded them with constancy  A delirium of historic deeds ever battled To break into the world through him Yet through the canyon of his fretless life There threaded such a line of fine refreshment That the merest weed and tiniest bird Might lave itself as I had learned to lave myself To lose my littleness  And his untrammelled instinct Swung him to the plumb of daily life Honor sobriety and self control Were swallowed up in a rage of instinctive Tightness That held him ever at the ship s prow Staying his acts as a relentless tide  And the same tide caught me And swayed my life And fie for shame found me too small Or else it might have made a poet of me  Andrea Hofer Proudfoot   SHE IS OVERHEARD SINGING  Oh Prue she has a patient man And Joan a gentle lover And Agatha s Arth is a hug the hearth But my true love s a rover  Mig her man s as good as cheese And honest as a briar Sue tells her love what he s thinking of But my dear lad s a liar  Oh Sue and Prue and Agatha Are thick with Mig and Joan They bite their threads and shake their heads And gnaw my name like a bone  And Prue says Mine s a patient man As never snaps me up And Agatha Arth is a hug the hearth Could live content in a cup  Sue s man s mind is like good jell All one color and clear And Mig s no call to think at all What s to come next year  While Joan makes boast of a gentle lad That s troubled with that and this   But they all would give the life they live For a look from the man I kiss  Cold he slants his eyes about And few enough s his choice Though he d slip me clean for a nun or a queen Or a beggar with knots in her voice  And Agatha will turn awake When her good man sleeps sound And Mig and Sue and Joan and Prue Will hear the clock strike round  For Prue she has a patient man As asks not when or why And Mig and Sue have naught to do But peep who s passing by  Joan is paired with a putterer That bastes and tastes and salts And Agatha s Arth is a hug the hearth But my true love is false   RECUERDO  We were very tired we were very merry We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry It was bare and bright and smelled like a stable But we looked into a fire we leaned across a table We lay on a hill top underneath the moon And the whistles kept blowing and the dawn came soon  We were very tired we were very merry We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry And you ate an apple and I ate a pear From a dozen of each we had bought somewhere And the sky went wan and the wind came cold And the sun rose dripping a bucketful of gold  We were very tired we were very merry We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry We hailed Good morrow mother to a shawl covered  head And bought a morning paper which neither of us read And she wept God bless you for the apples and pears And we gave her all our money but our subway fares  Edna St Vincent Millay   CHANGES  He thought it was a goddess in merry making mood But it was just a lady who wanted to be wooed  He knelt before that lady as suddenly to find Within his arms a woman who did not know her mind  He whispered to that woman discovering instead An insolent young savage who tried to kill and fled  He made after that savage high mounted pulse elate Ah will he know the beggar maid outside his postern gate  THE DECEIVER  He looks into my truthful face Beneath the rising moon And on his balalaika He plays a lying tune  My lover is but playing The real deceiver I Who look up with my truthful face And love him for his lie  Helen Muckley   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A T SEA  To A B G U S S M   Far out at sea a sail is drifting  Like a petal  Like a white moth  Like a scrap of paper blown by the wind  O white petal sail  Like a moth  Like a scrap of paper  Like me  O ebb and flow and infinitude of the sea As strange as insurgent as inevitable As my love  DAISIES  My lover is a sailor If he misses me at all The gold eyed daisies tell me One two three the petals fall  In some sunny southern harbor Where the girls line up to see Les Americains Bonjour M sieur He will pass them by for me   Every day I greet a sailor Walking lonely down the street Give him cigarettes a sweater Or a box of something sweet  And I tell him if he s thinking Of a girl somewhere out west Not to worry or be lonesome Just keep liking her the best  One two three the daisies tell me Four five six the petals drop Seven eight nine yes he still loves me He will never never stop  And those black eyed French cocottes With strange words upon their lips Waiting there with smiles of welcome For the sailors from the ships  Much a little not at all He s so far away so free Loves me not but last he loves me He will pass them by for me  Marjorie Meeker   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THREE POEMS  TH E BELOVED  You are my holy city my beloved Dark as Jerusalem and bright as Rome The gates of you are opened generously To take the prodigal home  What foreign towns I knew have never dimmed The burning memory of your altar fire My backward hungering heart has always heard In other songs your choir  I kiss your lips and dream of Lebanon You are my living Zion and I rest Here in the temple of your body s grace Beneath the white wall of your breast  CONQUEST  You have not conquered me it is the surge Of love itself that beats against my will It is the sting of conflict the old urge That calls me still  It is not you I love it is the form And shadow of all lovers that have died That gives you all the freshness of a warm And unfamiliar bride   It is your name I breathe your hands I seek It will be you when you are gone And yet the dream the name I never speak Is that that lures me on  It is the golden summons the bright wave Of banners calling me anew It is all beauty perilous and grave It is not you  END OF THE COMEDY  Eleven o clock and the curtain falls The cold wind tears the strands of illusion The delicate music is lost In the blare of home going crowds And a midnight paper  The night has grown martial It meets us with blows and disaster Even the stars have turned shrapnel Fixed in silent explosions And here at our door The moonlight is laid Like a drawn sword  Louis Untermeyer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WINGS OF SPRING  THE MARVEL  Up on the hill where trees were bare I saw her go the first spring dawn The thrushes came while she was there And sang when she had gone  I looked at noon and saw how light Had crept into the apple row The hill I said will soon be white With April apple snow  So I was sure that I had learned Why thrushes sang where she went by Yet on the day that she returned The leaves began to die  MARGOT  Dear one I cannot tell you in a word How sweet I think you are for you are gone Gone like a lovely song that I have heard But never learned from new leaved woods at dawn I think of fluting from a distant hill Blown in the spring by some light shepherd boy   Startling the winds and making birds be still And in my soul awakes a sudden joy A joy that rising to my lips must die With such pain as the night feels when afar Day s silver fingers slip along the sky And tremble up to take a fainting star You are the memory that a dream awakes Like dwindling music that an echo makes  SPARROW  O bird on the wire What is the world to you No vast place of unseen pressing things Designed by hidden gods Just light and warmth And air to beat your wings upon And that wet green bough Sparkling in the sun Where you are fluttering Is that your heaven  George O Neill   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SONGS TO A WOMAN  I  You are like startled song wings against my heart Which flutters like a harp string wounded By too much quivering music You cover me with a blue dream robe Whose silk ripples out like imaged water And when for a moment you leave I am a black sky awaiting its moon  II  If I could be moon light scattered out Over the blowing dark blue hair Of kneeling flowing crystal breezes Breathing a litany of pale odors If I could be moonlight scattered out Over the whispers meeting in your heart The marriage of our souls would be No more complete than now  III  Like a delicately absent minded guest Your smile sometimes lingers after Your lips are solemn And once I saw a tear in your eye   Playing hide and go seek with some leaping dimpled mem  ory These things to me are like scattered perfume Wavering down upon my heart  IV  The struggle of a smile craving birth Invades her little weeping faun s face And even makes her tear drops leap She smiles as only grief can smile A smile like ashes caught within A tiny whirlwind of light When the light goes the ashes drape her face Till even her lips seem grey  V  Wave your veils to pallid gavottes Blow them on with dimly spiced laughs And catch them breathlessly against your breast You have prayed too long in your sinking temple Night has come with her fumbling release Her moment in which you may play with sad thoughts So wave your veils to pallid gavottes Blow them on with dimly spiced laughs And catch them breathlessly against your breast  Maxwell Bodenheim   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FAUN  Your eyes are like the wind Grey clean and shining Behind them little lamps are lit eternally Making them the altar of your inextinguishable spirit I have seen a dream burn them blue And tenderness warm them to hazel And I have seen them black with thought But when I love them most they are the color of the wind Sweeping over the grasses and the sea  WISDOM THROUGH TEARS  I cannot seek to hold you Holding is losing Never my arms can fold you But by your choosing  What if beside me lie Flesh and blood merely And the soul wanders high I love so dearly  Miriam Allen deFord   SAINT SEBASTIAN  On slow and smoky fire thou burn st and art consumed O thou my soul On slow and smoky fire thou burn st and art consumed With hidden dole  Thou droopest like Sebastian pierced with pointed arrows Harassed and spent Thou droopest like Sebastian pierced with pointed arrows Thy flesh all rent  Thy foes encircle thee and watch with gleeful laughter And bended bow Thy foes encircle thee and watch with gleeful laughter Thy torments slow  The embers burn and gentle is the arrow s stinging Neath the evening sky The embers burn and gentle is the arrow s stinging When the end draws nigh  Why hastens not thy dream unto thy lips now pallid With deadly drouth Why hastens not thy dream unto thy lips now pallid To kiss thy mouth  From the Russian of Valéry Bryusov Translated in the original metre by Abraham Yarmolinsky   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THIS MAN  If only you were here Walt Whitman To tell the largeness of this man For only you could forget in space his enemies You who saw Lincoln stand up before the faces of a city Alone like this man Alone even when friended Alone with destiny You who saw him facing Manhattan Manhattan hating him Never a cheer That silence That anger That misunderstanding What would you say now Of this American This liberator This man of destiny Choired by the voices of slaves who would be freemen And of freemen who would renounce their slaves Called to be a witness of joy before the peoples of the earth Would you not say that lilacs have bloomed again And that out of their death their odor is the odor of life And that a star which had risen at evening grew pale toward  a morning of sun And that the beauty of the sinews of These States Summoned now   By this man To a new stature Shall become the beauty of the sinews of the world  Witter Bynner  MAYTIME  Out of darkness into light Out of dumbness into song Though the earth was wintry white  Though the cold stayed over long Spring we loved so it has come Without any sound of drum  Be it life we knew last year Wandered far and home once more Or a new babe cradled here Born of life that went before  We who linger while the days Shyly bud and bloom anew Are content that all the Mays Faithful are steadfast and true  William H Simpson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  GREEN AND GRAY  SOLID EARTH  Scurvy doctrine that the world is a bubble It is much more solid than that  A monument built out of rubble If you will a high silk hat With the inevitable brick inside A perfect whale of a brick  Love to make you vain and pride To make you sick  Scurvy doctrine that love s a tambourine A Love that is fond and true Is exactly like a tame hyena I m telling this to you A perfectly tangible hyena With perfectly ponderable paws You could climb a mountain in Argentina But you d know it was  Scurvy doctrine that joy is fleeting Joy is howling aloud At everyone in every meeting In every crowd Joy is what the heavens shake with At the earth beneath Joy is the thing you tame the snake with And grit your teeth   INFORMATION  He had green eyes that excellent seer And little peaks to either ear He sat there and I sat here  He spoke of Egypt and a white Temple against the star strewn night  He smiled with clicking teeth and said That the dead were never dead  Said old emperors hung like bats In barns at night or ran like rats But empresses came back as cats  GRAY  Fold on fold the purple crimson then Gold I shook my head and turned away What I turned and glared in that barbaric den Gray  Ashes rats You cannot cannot mean it surely Yes I chirped I m weary I have had a day One thing only suits me purely and demurely Gray  Doves and twilight seas fog and thistle down Granite quarried too pearl with all array   Of colors quenched within But you said a clown Gray  Yes I understand but you don t understand I m the clown of heaven and mean to have my way Cut me cloak and doublet This is my command Gray  William Rose Benêt  GRAVES OF DREAMS  So softly bright the golden twilight hung Over the graveyard where my dead dreams lay In other times I often passed that way You see they died so pitifully young  But now I shun the graying line on line For sterner tombs are rising crowding there And dreams are dead full grown and fair oh fair Soon shall they all be dead and none be mine  Robert Rand   POEMS  THE BUDDHA  The little gilded Buddha sits Patiently on my table With delicate quiet folded hands Musing upon eternity The lines of his drapery are Fluent as the ages Drooping gracefully in curves As life droops gently into death His face is calm he ignores me And all the fret and trouble of the world Contemplating me indifferently From the divan where I lie alone Vaguely I consider the gilded Buddha I cannot reach to his serenity He is not of my age I am not of his race He is not to me an inspiration To emotionless contemplation To me he is only a work of art The lines of his drapery drooping gracefully If I were to make an idol a symbol It would not be beautiful It would be a great Hammer And the world lying in fragments Or a woman with an angry face Tearing her breasts   But on my table an alien a foreigner Sits the gilded Buddha with face serene And patient quiet folded hands Musing on eternity  Life is greater than eternity  KITTY  I say you are a spirit So delicate and pale You are not flesh But in you love is meshed Which makes earth heaven or near it So all words fail  Your face is moon white and withal Sad as the moon And in your eyes a light As of a temple lit by night Where tired souls creep and fall Asking God s boon Prostrate am I before your soul For I have seen That it is luminous as love as pure as pain And kept forever washed by sorrow s rain A chosen one to stand before the goal And lead the bruised one in   SONGS FROM THE ADVENTURER  I The robin is out in a speckled vest And his day is a day in June Oh what cares he for the old dead nest October will give him a new red breast And April the old old tune  II O road road whither will you take me What is round the bend Will you make me or break me And will the day forsake me Before I reach the end  O road road whither are you flowing  So far so far so far Is any knowing where you are going Through woods and up the hills to where is showing  On the world s edge a star  FUCHSIAS AND GERANIUMS  What is Life  To me life is to sit on these stone steps Under the peach tree eating green almonds Watching the indolent shadow arabesques Shift on the terrace   While you couch on the coping of the steps On cushions of velvet from old Venice Reading Endymion Up from the city far below Comes the noon scream of whistles I watch the shadows of the slim peach leaves Gently finger your brown soft coiled hair And know the sun is in love  Suddenly a lustrous humming bird Poises under the bell of a fuchsia flower His green back shimmering opal fire He hangs there a moment a jewel suspended from nothing How can his wings move so fast He is gone Sun god are you a mechanic a painter designer A yellow butterfly wanders aimlessly So it seems to me among the red geraniums It is gone  The fuchsias are gouts of blood The geraniums are leaping flames You couch on the coping of the steps On cushions of velvet of old Venice And I am suspended before you a moment This to me is life  It is gone  Charles Erskine Scott Wood COMMENT  WALT WHITMAN  NE hundred years ago this month Walt Whitman was born His simple self sufficient life is a record of unhurried cumulative power which waited until mid career before setting itself to address the world Though he lived seventy two years his complete works of verse and prose are easily contained in two volumes  Rereading the Leaves consecutively instead of repeating my favorites over and over I have been reminded of a visit in 1910 to the Rembrandt galleries at the Hermitage in Petrograd where in two hundred or more canvases good bad and indifferent one could study the great painter in all his moods search his genius through days of faltering or excess as well as days of triumph  Even so with Whitman though he was less prolific than Rembrandt his spiritual kinsman His Leaves show his genius entire the times when it lagged into prosy moralizing or leaped into bombast as well as those proud hours of the Lincoln elegy or Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking or the Whispers of Heavenly Death They show again like Rembrandt his power as a colorist as a draughtsman of immense and revolutionary rhythms as a democrat and lover of men and as a serious minded thinker also his limitations of perspective and range caused by lack of humor and certain disabilities in self criticism  Almost everything has been said about Whitman from   the sneers of his first detractors to the large praise of present day enthusiasts as when a recent article in the Mercure de France mentioned him quite casually and as a matter of course with Dante Homer Shakespeare and the few other greatest masters His centenary finds his fame established and his mockers rebuked already his bearded figure has grown and simplified into colossal monumental granite as indestructible as a mountain a place of pilgrimage for the imaginations of men There he is as Henry James might say and there whether we like it or not his spirit may have the power of the vates to bring These States to his feet and mold ideals for the democratisation of the world  It may be our province at this moment of general tribute to record with special emphasis certain details of Whitman s service to poetic art Even that noble shelf monument The Cambridge History of American Literature by closing one period with Lowell and opening another with Whitman shows how two exactly contemporary poets may live in different ages and be ruled by contrary stars Whitman began a new era and the finis which he uttered to the old was heard by foreign nations and the next age  Of course his first and most obvious service to poetic art was his insistence on freedom of form his rejection of the usually accepted English metrics and his success in writing great poems without their aid Not that he misprized Chaucer Shakespeare Shelley and the rest but he must find for himself a rhythm as personal as theirs His second service was corollary to the first the rejection of clichés   Walt Whitman  including archaic diction and so called poetic phrasing That this rejection was not wholly instinctive but enforced by conscious labor is proved by a sentence from Specimen Days  Commenced putting Leaves of Grass to press for good after many manuscript doings and undoings I had great trouble in leaving out the stock poetical touches but succeeded at last  Such authority as he had for these rejections of the long accepted the worn was derived rather from Asiatic than European classics the Hebrew Bible the mighty Hindu epics and a hundred lesser but typical works And this brings us to his third service to the art a service larger than the others and purely spiritual his reassertion of the ancient conception of the poet as prophet and of poetry as religion as an ecstatic expression of faith He says  All the poems of Orientalism with the Old and New Testaments at the centre tend to deep and wide psychological development with little or nothing at all of the mere aesthetic the principal verse requirement of our day  To biblical poetry especially he ascribes  Faith limitless its immense sensuousness immensely spiritual an incredible all inclusive non worldliness and dew scented illiteracy the antipodes of our Nineteenth Century business absorption and morbid refinement no hair splitting doubts no sickly sulking and sniffling  And he asks  Will there ever be a time or place ever a student however modern of the grand art to whom those compositions will not afford profounder lessons than all else of their kind in the garner age of the past Could there be any more opportune suggestion of what the office of poet was in primeval times and is yet capable of being anew adjusted entirely to the modern   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Thus his effort as a poet was to free the art of conventions of form and phrase and to kindle in it the old sacred fire Poetry was to be no longer an ornament of the libraries it was to get out of doors and sing the large faiths faith in life and death in love and war in mountains and trees and rivers in the sun and sky and the good hard flesh of the earth and it was to sing these large faiths in large rhythms rhythms that follow the beat of winds and waves rather than man made metrics  He was but one of many there would be armies of poets to follow him The personnel in any race he insists can never be really superior without superior poems And in Blue Ontario s Shore he cries Of all races and eras These States with veins full of poetical stuff  most need poets and are to have the greatest and use them the greatest Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their poets shall Soul of love and tongue of fire Eye to pierce the deepest deeps and sweep the world Indeed at this point enthusiasm begets his one besetting sin the poet is lost in the rhapsodist and we have turgid pages describing this bard of the future west bred and of the common stock Such turgidity such excess should hardly be mentioned however only the lesser masters are impeccable artists Let us pause rather over certain poems in which spirit and art are in complete accord  I find this on the whole and in spite of lapses which are carried in triumph as it were in the poem Walt Whitman which if I am not mistaken opened the first edition   of Leaves of Grass This poem was a declaration of spiritual and artistic independence and technically it established his rhythmic system which follows the diversified regularity  of waves sweeping the shore or of hills curving along the horizon rather than the exactness of closer intervals The poem has magnificent passages from the much quoted  I loaf and invite my soul  I lean and loaf at my ease observing a spear of summer grass  to that trumpet note near the end  I too am not a bit tamed I too am untranslatable  I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world  This poem was also the poet s declaration of faith a faith fundamental universal  Waiting responses from oracles honoring the Gods saluting the sun Making a fetish of the first rock or stump pow wowing with sticks  in the circle of obis Helping the lama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession rapt and  austere in the woods  Children of Adam also contains magnificent passages but as a poem it moves less surely than the other as if the poet in asserting the nobility of sex were more conscious of fighting a battle and therefore less spontaneous In most of Calamus Salut au Monde and Song of the Broad axe the poet is lost in the rhapsodist In the Song of the Open Road we find him again and follow him through the gates of the West and Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking with that song of the sea bird to its lost mate is a perfect and prodigious masterpiece   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  In many of the Drum taps we hear as in no other mod  ern songs of war the gathering and mighty tramp of armies  also the rush of city crowds at the call the spirit of dread  ful hours and the ultimate spirit of reconciliation  Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be utterly lost That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly wash again and ever again this soiled world  Superb also are certain of the Marches Now that the War is Over and most glorious of all of course is that grandest most serene of elegies President Lincoln s Burial Hymn When lilacs last in the door yard bloomed In all his songs of death heavenly death delicate death some of them beautiful beyond praise is the same high serenity  I hear America singing he cried and it is for us and those who follow us to fulfil the prophecy The London Times has pointed out how accurately in Years of the Modern he foresaw the present situation of the world the tremendous exits and entrances the new combinations the solidarity of races the issuing forth against the idea of caste the marching and countermarching by swift millions Perhaps at this moment of epic climax in the affairs of this nation and all nations we may close with his word of warning  To The States or any one of them or any city of The States  Resist much obey little  Once unquestioning obedience once fully enslaved Once fully enslaved no nation state city of this earth ever afterward resumes its liberty  H M   MANNERISMS OF FREE VERSE  However much it may be claimed that free verse is closer to natural speech to the natural breath cadence and pause than metrical poetry the reverse is actually true of the majority of examples published today Open any magazine at random and you will find that the score of the poem resembles a score of music in which the rests exceed the notes Nor does the pattern even so resolve itself into music into any organic rhythm of any sort it is rather as jerky as a doll that is pulled by strings strings which occasionally stick and elicit only Pa when one is waiting for Pa Pa or Ma a a when one expects the full maternal salutation Like an arrested movie of a man walking the verse halts foot high in air without any apparent rhyme or reason until the machine starts it going again  Timidly Against a background of brick tenements Some trees spread their branches Skyward  Or on another page  A late snow beats  With cold white fists upon the tenements  Hurriedly drawing blinds and shutters  Like tall old slatterns  Pulling aprons about their heads  Is it symptomatic of the disorganization and disconnection of modern life that so much free verse is composed of momentary impressions stabbing sensations the mere statement of which is supposed to make a poem as in the above passage images and sensations piled one on top of the   other with no continuity of thought or emotion as with no fluidity of rhythm a result momentarily arresting but with no power to hold beyond the moment and as examples multiply certain to prove infinitely irritating and wearisome Perhaps it will further illustrate the point to quote other passages following the one just given  Lights slanting from Mott street Gibber out Or dribble through tea room slits Where anonymous shapes Conniving behind shuttered panes Caper and disappear  Only the Bowery  Is throbbing like a fistula  Back of her ice scabbed fronts  Where livid faces  Glimmer in furtive doorways  Or spill out of the black pockets of alleys  Formerly we used to think that something was supposed to happen in a poem but in these poems full as they are of movement and as restless as a jumping jack nothing really ever happens at all The Jack jumps up and down on the stick but beyond Jack and the stick there is nothing Yet it is hardly the nothingness of the mystic  Another pleasing characteristic of free verse as it is written today is the pompous solemnity of its platitudes which broken into fragments would seem to the author to be less bromidically obvious than if stated in plain prose But it need hardly be said that the author deceives himself A pleasing title for a book of this kind would be Cracked China And then there is the very simple statement reiter   ated upon which much free verse builds itself in what we may call the Primer Style of Vers Libre I am sitting in my room I am looking out of the window At the leaves The brown leaves They fall They flutter They drop Do you see the leaves fall It is night The wind is blowing Oh how it blows Do you hear it blow Perhaps indeed the first readers of the next generation will be completely made up of the free verse of this  But does it not seem odd that those who insist that poetry should be at least as well written as good prose should have descended to a second childhood in free verse and that the most of free verse is written in what is such incredibly bad prose And does it not seem odd that the question of style has been overlooked by all the critics in a barren discussion of rhythm rhythm which does not for the most part exist  Truly free verse as a vehicle exhibits many varieties which still await classification and analysis and yet there is such a marked similarity among free verse practitioners today that without a signature it is difficult to tell one poet from another Mr Bernard Berenson thinks he can tell Botticellis by the shape of the thumb but unless one is   expert in some such detective method one is at a loss to assign correctly the ownership of much free verse that is if one plays fair and refuses to look at the signature until one has ventured a guess  It is difficult for instance to know whether Miss Lowell is writing Mr Bynner s verse or whether he is writing hers With one or two exceptions almost any of the free verse writers now practicing could have written Mr Bynner s Songs of the Unknown Lover whose recent anonymous publication gave one a good opportunity to guess  But the proof of the poet is as always in the thing that distinguishes him from the crowd the thing that makes one pick him out by the divine sign as Whitman would say And this operates no less in free verse than in rhymed Nor need one fear Mediocrity in free verse like mediocrity in metrical verse will pass and be forgotten While it lasts however it is if anything the more tiresome of the two A C H  REVIEWS  CHAMBER MUSIC OLD AND NEW  Chamber Music by James Joyce B W Huebsch Corn from Olde Fieldes an Anthology of English Poems  from the XIVth to the XVIIth Century with biograph  ical notes by Eleanor M Brougham John Lane Co  Mr James Joyce is better known as a novelist and playwright than as a poet and deservedly so For after every   thing has been said that could possibly be said in favor of his poems after one has noted their musical phrasing their verbal felicity their delicate charm the fact is that the general tone is rather pale and anaemic and the music thin The music indeed has been compared to that of the Elizabethan song books but this is hardly fair to Mr Joyce and the spirit of the poems is much closer to the 1890 s than to the Elizabethan mood which is very much fuller and richer in every way There are however Elizabethan echoes in the book as there are echoes of W B Yeats Herrick Francis Thompson and others In fact this is one tantalizing feature of the book there are so many undefined echoes in it in a single poem one sometimes finds several distinct threads of reminiscence which one may not be able to trace all at once an occurrence which proves as disturbing as failure to remember a name or a word Of course for some people this does not detract from a poem it seems rather to add a certain classic flavor to it but unless this  tendency is offset by something very positive of the author s own it is I think likely to prove annoying  Such a poem for instance as VII My love is in a light attire has several leads that start one off on false scents making one forget the poem itself and hark back to the originals and although one may not be able to put a finger on any exact source though one may vacillate from Herrick to Francis Thompson and back again stopping at certain anonymous song writers by the way it is enough to make one wish for something more stable and resolute in   the poem itself The last poem in the book I hear an army charging upon the land is complete Yeats and would be a good poem even so were it not for the weak last line Other poems although musical and fairly free from echoes are somewhat colorless Admitting therefore all the delicacy and grace of the lyrics it is impossible at the same time not to feel disappointed in the book as a whole It is not that I love Mr Joyce the less but that I love Elizabethan lyrics more  A sharper more distinctive mood is found in XVII and XXXIII and XXXV are among the best of the poems but the general effect of many of them is somehow benumbing This one is typical enough to quote  My dove ray beautiful one  Arise arise  The night dew lies  Upon my lips and eyes The odorous winds are weaving A music of sighs  Arise arise  My dove my beautiful one  I wait by the cedar tree  My sister my love  White breast of the dove  My breast shall be your bed  The pale dew lies  Like a veil on my head  My fair one my fair dove  Arise arise  Set Mr Joyce s book beside some of the formless free verse of today and this is not to say that free verse is necessarily formless quite the reverse and one appreciates its   form even when that form is quite definitely artifice but set it beside Miss Brougham s anthology Corn from Olde Fieldes and one realizes that there is more stuff in a single Elizabethan lyric than in Mr Joyce s whole book  Take for instance almost at random two slight songs from this anthology the first Two Loves by an unknown author  Brown is my love but graceful  And each renowned whiteness  Matched with thy lovely brown loseth its brightness  Fair is my love but scornful  Yet I have seen despised  Dainty white lilies and sad flowers well prized  And the second Of Beauty is by Sir Richard Fanshawe  Let us use it while we may  Snatch those joys that haste away  Earth her winter coat may cast  And renew her beauty past  But our winter come in vain  We solicit spring again  And when our furrows snow shall cover  Love may return but never lover  Although so slight and seemingly hackneyed and ephemeral these have a fulness which we of a later more complex day may envy And I have purposely chosen two which are inconsiderable as compared with others  Miss Brougham s anthology is admirable in every respect She has omitted from it almost all the better known poems included in the usual anthologies and has given instead the poems of lesser known authors or the lesser known poems of well known authors which might otherwise escape those readers who care for poetry but have not the antiquarian   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  bent And she has thus rendered a very great service to the majority of us who care very deeply for these old English songs It is impossible to quote the book itself is a quotation from centuries rich in poetic ore One notes a remarkably high standard of excellence Good form and fine taste poetically speaking characterize it throughout It makes one wonder whether after some years our present welter of modern verse may not consolidate into some general really excellent mode of expression which shall serve to express the mind of our time for the mind of this book although it covers three or four centuries is practically one mind One reason for this may be that the outstanding spirits the high turbulent souls are not represented here or if represented in the less individual aspect Today each one of us wants to be a high turbulent soul an individual each one is less concerned with creating good art than with producing something which may be considered original and we spend more time talking about art than learning how to make it It is a fact that one gets paid more for criticism today than for creative work A book of verse gives employment to countless reviewers but will not support the author But ours is not the age of faith and that is I think the chief trouble with our poetry and our pictures although by faith of course I do not mean anything dogmatic or theological But no matter what the individual attitude the poems in this anthology seem to live in a free world of faith of faith that is in art Their mood is not hesitant it is not analytical but synthetic and hence   their abundance and their richness even under the guise of a seeming carelessness A C H  OLD ENGLAND  Last Poems by Edward Thomas Selwyn and Blount  London  I do not know of any recent poetry which conveys more of the feeling of unchanging England the old England of heath and down and woodland the wild savage England that still strangely persists through the centuries than does the poetry of Edward Thomas With the solitary exception of Thomas Hardy no poet seems less concerned with the industrialism the cosmopolitan culture of this century than does this brooding semi Celt from Wiltshire who began to write poetry when he was forty and who but a year or two later found a soldier s grave in France  Reading these Last Poems of his makes one forget that Thomas became a soldier forget even that he is dead His voice in these pages still seems to vibrate in the air about us as of one living and very near The soldiering the sacrifice seem the merest accident Indeed Thomas would have wished it to be not otherwise thought upon He was the sort of man to pass to death without a gesture of heroism without a word of protest Unless we understand this we cannot understand how greatly he loved England We cannot understand either the minds of thousands of other English soldiers who have died in the same way   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I do not mean to assert by this that Thomas was a great poet He was not We especially if we are not Englishmen must be careful not to read him except in a responsive mood He annoys us otherwise as the English climate is likely to annoy travellers to these shores His persistent mood of melancholy his perpetually letting one down his harping always on some quite ageless and dateless past his stumbling awkward technique reminding me of roughcast walls and ragged hedges all these prevent one from coming to immediate grips with him For these reasons though he is a deep sincere poet he never carries you quite away on a first reading He is one to be studied to be taken up and re read from time to time  In this respect as indeed in most respects he is a writer spiritually akin to Robert Frost And I think it is no secret to say that but for Frost Thomas might never have turned to poetry at all or at least might have written less well Americans should feel proud to think that it was the work of the poet of New England that made it possible for Edward Thomas to express what was latent in him  In the present volume one s mind naturally turns first to the conversational quasi narrative poems in loose blank verse which show most of the Frost influence The English critics have generally avoided praising any of these poems Wind and Mist The Chalk Pit and The New Year T o these we may add The Other The Gipsy Man and Dog and The Private which are in rhyme but essentially poems displaying the same sort of motive and technique It is in   these poems however that I think the essential Edward  Thomas is to be found and not in the lyrics which show  strong traces of W H Davies and in some cases of Yeats  Wind and Mist is in my opinion the finest of these poems  It is almost impossible to state the contents of this poem  without quoting it entirely Two men meet on a hilltop  and fall to talking Says one  If you like angled fields Of grass and grain bounded by oak and thorn Here is a league Had we with Germany To play upon this board it could not be More dear than April has made it with a smile The fields beyond that league close in together And merge even as our days into the past Into one wood that has a shining pane Of water Then the hills of the horizon That is how I should make hills had I to show One who would never see them what hills were like  T o which the other replies  Yes sixty miles of South Downs at one glance Sometimes a man feels proud of them as if He had just created them with one mighty thought  The two men then begin discussing a house near by The first speaker admires it and wonders why it is empty It turns out that the other man has lived there and has left it hating it And in these words we are given a picture of  the life there  Doubtless the house was not to blame But the eye watching from those windows saw Many a day day afer day mist mist Like chaos surging back marooned alone We lived in clouds on a cliff s edge almost You see and if clouds went the visible earth Lay too far off beneath and like a cloud   There were other things Real too In that room at the gable a child Was born while the wind chilled a summer dawn Never looked grey mind on a greyer one Than when the child s cry broke above the groans  There were whole days and nights when the wind and I Between us shared the world and the wind ruled And I obeyed it and forgot the mist My past and the past of the world were in the wind  But the mere setting down of these fragments does not suffice to give the whole power and strength of this poem Here we obtain a picture of an England not to be found in the writings of most present day English poets and we owe this to the insight the knowledge and the love of Edward Thomas John Gould Fletcher  THREE WHITMAN BOOKS  Visits to Walt Whitman in I89O I89I by J Johnston  M D and J W Wallace Egmont Arens The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman edited by Thomas B Harned Doubleday Page and Co Patriotic Poems of Walt Whitman Doubleday Page amp Co  Of Walt Whitman s prophetic utterances about his poetry none was more true than This is no book who touches this touches a man His touch reached with undiminished thrill across the ocean as alive as though his personal presence went with it Visits to Whitman in I89O I89I exhibits hero worship in its most exalted form and its most amiable Not only may one savor the character and per   sonality of Walt Whitman in these accounts but taste enviably the glamour that was about the poet his sanctity for the two young Lancashire men who came so far on their pilgrimages of devotion and recorded them with such exact love  The influence of a great soul over those few of its generation great enough to make answer to it takes many forms knows many degrees in the discipleship it evokes The response of a noble woman to a noble man must perhaps be expected to hold some tinge of sexuality in its blended force if it reaches perfection completeness It is too early to generalize about women Anne Gilchrist s reaction to Whitman aroused all her nature Intellectually her appreciation of Whitman her appraisal of his greatness as a poet of his message of his future have not been excelled in enthusiasm or acumen by any of the poet s eulogists though her estimate came at a time 1869 when Whitman s detractors were many and those who understood him were few By study and instinct Anne Gilchrist was scientific in outlook and her analysis of Whitman s work in relation to evolutionary discoveries and revisions is significant of her time and of her character From her Confession of Faith which is reprinted in this volume as prefatory to the letters comes the following passage to be remarked by those who would talk of democracy and greatness  True Inequality is one of Nature s words she moves forward always by means of the exceptional But the moment the move is accomplished then all her efforts are toward equality toward bringing up the rear to that standpoint But social inequalities   class distinctions do not stand for or represent Nature s inequalities Precisely the contrary in the long run They are devises for holding up many that would else gravitate down and keeping down many who would else rise up for providing that some should reap who have not sown and many sow without reaping But literature tallies the ways of Nature for though itself the product of the exceptional its aim is to draw all men up to its own level The great writer is hungry for equals day and night for so only can he be fully understood The meal is equally set all are invited Therefore is literature whether consciously or not the greatest of all forces on the side of Democracy  Perhaps it is enough tribute to Walt Whitman that the year of his centenary finds the world discussing democracy as never before It is a good year in which to call attention to Whitman as a patriot and democrat and this his publishers have done in an effective way by bringing out the small book of selections containing the poet s war poems and poems of his hopes for America his challenge to those who would be America s leaders and poets  I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals The American compact is altogether with individuals The only government is that which makes minute of individuals The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one single  individual namely to You  H H  LAMARTINE  The Life of Lamartine by H Remsen Whitehouse Hough  ton Mifflin Co  This is biography in a fascinating sense and it is impossible to do it justice in the space of a short review It is in two volumes the first dealing with Lamartine the poet the second almost entirely with the brilliant career the disap   Lamartine  pointments and the final days of Lamartine the statesman With tireless research into a veritable maze of material with unsparing honesty the author has coordinated force and weakness has sifted out truths half hidden in falsehoods and given us a living personality  The author quotes Lamartine himself as saying that he held his poetic gift in slight esteem compared to his ambitions to be a statesman The credulous public believe that  have spent thirty years of my life publishing rhymes and contemplating the stars I have not spent thirty  months in so doing Mr Whitehouse s work proves that whatever may be said Lamartine s political and poetical ambitions went almost evenly hand in hand throughout his life Certainly to be a poet was to be handicapped as a politician Lamartine once wrote to a friend  The reputation of poet is the worst of any in the eyes of the men who rule this matter of fact world  And the author comments  All his life long Lamartine was to experience the truth which underlies this axiom His political career was to be continually subjected to the jeers and sneers of those who saw in every humanitarian measure he advocated even in his unflinching faith in the future of railways and other economic innovations the poetic idealization their souls abhorred  It would seem that a discussion of Lamartine s contemporaries might well have had its place in this biography A few years after the appearance of his second Meditations Victor Hugo Alfred de Vigny Casimir Delavigne Alfred de Musset Madame de Girardin and many others were conspicuous Even then Gautier may have been chiselling   out his Émaux et Camées and Béranger was still thrilling France with his downright songs Where such names as these do occur they occur only incidentally and there is no attempt at any discussion of the works they represent  Lamartine has been called the French Byron I see no reason why Byron should not as well have been called the English Lamartine Though each denied a school each really represented the romantic movement in his own country But they were as different as are their two languages True Lamartine was in his early days influenced by the Englishman whom he held in the highest admiration But he was influenced even more by Rousseau and Goethe even going so far as to speak of Werther as the mental malady of my poetic youth Those who derive from Mr White house s work merely an echo of Byron should look deeper They may be surprised to see how the French poet writing in a time now so far from our own was in touch with today differing from his contemporaries in his use of form in his free handling and varying of rhythms and metres and in his setting aside of tradition whenever to do so seemed to serve his purpose This led him to be looked upon askance by at least one publisher whom he visited with the manuscript of the Méditations hidden under his coat poems which later were to set the literary world aflame The publisher having looked it over returned it to him saying  I have read your verses sir they are not devoid of talent but they show no study They resemble in no way that which is accepted and expected in our poets One knows not where you have found   Lamartine  the language the ideas the imagery of this poetry it can be classed with no definite kind it is a pity for there is harmony in your verse Give up this innovation which would simply upset French tradition go back to our masters Delille Parny Michaud Raynouard Luce de Lancival Fontanes those are the poets the public loves imitate somebody if you want to be accepted and read  Lamartine was of today too in his insistence that improvements in material life for instance steam boats and railroads have their poetical side and may be used successfully for poetical ends In this connection passages are quoted from La Chute d un Ange wherein the poet discarding the wings of Icarus as hackneyed invents an airplane and the biographer goes on to say The illusion produced is sufficiently plausible to impress the reader as to his knowledge of mechanics  Several intensely interesting chapters of the first volume are devoted to the friendship between the poet and Madame Charles Those who would understand the poet and his writings must take into account this vital factor As to the actual character of this relationship there have been many opinions but Mr Whitehouse records that it purified the poet completely of any former taste for merely vulgar affairs of the heart Whatever conjecture may have to say the world is indebted for many imperishable lyrics to this one great love of his life this spiritual union with Madame Charles His friendship with this rare woman began long before he met the Englishwoman who became his wife and who stood beside him so staunchly through his triumphs and misfortunes About this marriage there has been much misunder   standing his wife s wealth having given it a mercenary aspect But we must remember that the French custom of arranging for a dot was adhered to even more rigorously in those days than now They were congenial comrades from the first and Miss Birch fell deeply in love with her brilliant suitor That she married him with full knowledge of the dominating picture he still held in his heart is well known When his wife s austerity discountenanced any audacity of thought or form it was this picture that forced the poet to be himself and stand by aspirations then considered chimerical but today justified for as Mr White house points out He spoke for the future and the present has vindicated him  Le Lac and Le Crucifix share equal honors in being not only the two most exquisite of Lamartine s lyrics but the two perhaps most directly traceable to the spiritual significance of his romance with Madame Charles Le Lac is reminiscent of his first meeting with the woman he loved and Le Crucifix as poignantly tender and beautiful an elegy as was ever written in any language sprang from his anguish over her death A little ivory crucifix was given to Lamartine which his beloved had held in her hands in her last agony and which had received her last breath The poet has said of this elegy le ne relis jamais ces vers c est assez de les avoir écrits  The author has shown discernment in his poetical quotations which are none too many Among them we are glad to see that outcry against injustice the memorable address   Lamartine  to Count d Orsay Here are the closing lines  Au pilori du temps n expose pas mon ombre Je suis las des soleils laisse mon urne à l ombre Le bonheur de la mort c est d être enseveli Je ne veux pas de vos bruits qu un souffle dans la brise  Un nom inachevé dans un coeur qui se brise J ai vécu pour la foule et je veux dormir seul  Almost throughout the first volume we find the poet filled with a restless craving for political action a craving satisfied in the second volume where we follow his contact with the affairs of state his parliamentary progress his dealings with the provisional government his foreign and domestic policy etc all of which brought him so conspicuously to the fore Both volumes are enriched by good portraits Agnes Lee Freer CORRESPONDENCE  WITH THE ARMY OF OCCUPATION  The following letter comes from the witty
