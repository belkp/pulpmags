Clarence Turnerhis bookthank Godhad already reached its eighth editionand there was the reasonable possibility of his play appearing on BroadwayThe successin facthad been immediateNot that Turner was low enough in the scale of jackals to have actually pandered to the public tastesOn the contraryhe had written in all sincerityand it was simply a lucky accident that those subjects which were nearest to his heart happened to scratch the itch of the muck and glut of America s reading publicIfclimbing upon the ruins of Americawe have reached Clarence Turner11 PART TWO ArgumentOr ratherhaving cast about for a themewe came upon that of Clarence TurnerIt isperhapsworth further developmentON the third floor he stopped at a room which was done in purplesFlorence was lying downappropriately Ahthen you can come to see meClara she said to him with a certain commendable richnessHe went over to herand kissed herand kissed herand all the memories of herGlancing at the mantelpiecehe noticed that the lion s head had been restored to its place Oncehe had gone over to touch itcalling forth from Florence a startled crypretty but honestAnother timewhen he was looking at it steadilyshe walked between themBut Clarence got the thing laid out quite clearly after a whileas is evident from thisWhile they were taking tea togetherhe had blurted out quite inconsequently It strikes me that the lion s head has a most fatherly look The next time he camethe head had disappearedand within a week he had attained herYesI can comeand I dare comein spite of your loveliness he answered in tune See what I was readingYour book again and againone chapterYou can not tell me that that chapter was not written to meohyou know the one Not being quite sure of the oneClarence bowed his head in mute acknowledgement that he knew itohtoo wellThen a trembling came over himand he ate her hand with kisses But above and beyond the fact that she had set Rimbaud to musicand had even published songs of her own in which Turner figured indubitablyabove and beyond the yield of her kimonos and the genius she had for draping shadows about a roomthere was the fact that she slid as gracefully into other arms as into his ownwhich explains after a fashion why he suddenly broke off the affairmarrying some one of a less accomplished quality in her voiceSoon after thisas a divine vengeancecame the success of his novel 12 Suddenly she aroseand thensignificantly But we shall have tea He looked at her deadlyand let his head sag into his handsShe sang three or four weak litle bars of a song of hersand wrapped her kimono more tightly about herThese little touches had been almost brutally definiteeach understood just what had been given and takenIt wasroughlythisBut we shall have tea WhatClarenceyou think I can be put down and picked up again at willI shall break the whole trend of our emotions with the irrelevant tinkling of the tea things His sagging headI accept itFlorenceperhaps after a fashion even welcome itbut I am not too proud to have you see me desolate over the lossLookI am frankly miserableour friendship has meant so much Her timid little flurrry of songStillyou deardear boyit must be that wayif our memories are to be retained in all their purityOh Godto see it of a suddenjust what we hadand what we have lostAndthe wrapping of the kimonoBut all that is settled nowsnapit is finishedThere is a wall between usSilence for a few momentswhile they listened to the far echoes of a relationship which was irrevocably gone It was all quite sympathetic to his mentalitythis thick aura of soul which in the course of centuries has come to interpose itself between the agent and the feminal The silence continued all during the preparation of the teaOver against the general formlessness of their emotions came the definite clinking of the ChinaClarence s eyes worked earnestly about the designs in the carpetThen she noddedand he pulled up his chairTheir feet met beneath the tableshe did not withdrawbut looked at him steadilyHow far their relationship had retrogradedShe laughed after a time in anticipation of a sentence which she was going to say Hait almost seems it had been only the littlest laugh it almost seemsClaraas though you will not really be here until you have left Then she became agitated A history of teaA history of teaIs there anything but walls and beds which has seen humanity more intimatelyIndeedI vote for teaClarencefor here the great organ notes of our passions are turned into the neatesttiniest little cameos13 Think of a murder across the tea tableWhat a lovely hokku the whole idea would makeIt should be doneof coursewith some sort of poisonous needleheld out along with a very properly turned complimentand barely scratching the skin An the final deathwould the victim fall across the tableWould the tea things come rattling to the floorthe destruction of a miniature empireReallyit is all very lovelydon t you thinkBoth being very conscious that MrsTurner could not do this sort of thing at all And thenBut let me put away the tea thingsI must put them away nowFor I shall not be able to bear itseeing the room all cluttered up by youAnd I must rearrange the chairs Without ostentationClarence took the ends of the cigarettes which he had lined along his saucer there should be no fetishes and carried them to the gratethrew them out of his lifeand hersIt was all so plain that this day was his last hold upon their intimacyNow he could still go to her and take her in his armsbut after leaving this room this daywhen he met her on the streethe would touch his hatask a few words about her brothertell her some recent anecdoteand then hurry awayHe resented any distraction as a sin against this woman in front of himYet his wife would surely be expecting him from now onHe felt subconsciously that he should offer Florence a pure immersion in the presentin the emphatic this ness and here ness of their partingTheir partingsince that was certainEverything that had happened this afternoon seemed to leave some little broken endHe arose abruptlywent to his hat and coat and threw them across his armWalking to the doorhe opened itand paused with one hand on the knobFlorence dripped into her chairlooking at him without meaningOn her little writing table the phone began ringingOncetwicethen with a nagging impatienceTacitlyhoweverthey agreed to rule it out of the sceneStillit did increase the tempo of their leave takingfor he began to close the door with a jerk of sudden decisionShe leapt from her chairbolted toward himHe received her with a groancrushing his hat between 14 themThen he turned and went stumbling blindly down the stairswhile the phone peeled forth one wildunbroken plaintReaching homeTurner hurried straight to his roomwhere for some hours he wrote feverishlyPART THREE ArgumentBecoming impatientthe author finally wanders elsewhereand seems in the direction of a positive beautywhen the old subject returns like a gastric juice in the throatHE fell asleep in the early morningand when he awoke again at eight he found that the life had faded out of himHe went down for a walkbought an orange at an Italian fruit store on Sullivan Streetand ate it standing on the cornerA drayhorse had fallen in the slush Turner watched the agony of its feet as it struggled to risewhile its team mate looked about with indifferenceFinally he surrendered himselfHe accepted it more or less consciously that he had given time enough to the burial of his love taking the termthat isas a technical expressionby which is meant that lovelike potato farming or marine insuranceis developing a specific nomenclature as the manifestations thereof are becoming more standardized with the help of educationNowif our more prominent novelistsof the type of Turnercould have taken two years of the classics and then two years intensive study in amoristic engineeringthis fact could have been put upon its right basis long before nowA graph of the human heartfor instanceby a senior AE could have traced the curve from Seeing Her Passthrough Poignant Night and With Her Aloneending perhaps with Burial of His LoveTo look upon this as a scientific terminologythat isso that the phraseBurial of his loveshould not be dismissed as banalbut rather accepted as the accurate dictionary equivalent for the thing itselfand sanctioned by the consensus of the leading minds of the nationThe steady rumble of every day had gradually reclaimed himso that he turned from the drayhorses Christafter Florence could not his wife even be called a drayhorseStand up the sorry thing and look at herHe could do thatthat was his 15 tradeThe brutewalking along these streetsexciting no interestand yet tearing the

gunGun is the name of cannonHe fell off of a cannon and was seriously woundedHe is now a cabinet makerIn recounting the glories of France she never forgets the father of her childHer child is a girl I can not give a description of her characterI have been puzzled she saidI have been puzzled as to her 19 characterI know nowShe is a sovereignThis is not what was saidShe had a brother killed not in the warShe said to me Come to BrittanyI said I did not like BrittanyShe said have you ever been thereI said I have met many people who have been thereAnd what do they sayThey say it is a very pretty countryyou can see it only in one dayWe then went togetherGodivaGodiva is fairShe has two places instead of hairAnd she movesnicelyI am describing Brittany to dayTo day there are a great many Bretons who take part in fishing hunting in harvestingin manufacturingand in auditingA great many of them are in hospitalAnd a great many of them love women children ducks and ribbonThey nourish restrictionWe said to SinnyCan you clean bronzeShe saidI live beside quarriesBut there is a lake tooYes there is a lake and supperWe have coffee for supperMy mother makes the fireAnd what does your father doMy father grows cameliasNot in BrittanyWhy certainly in Brittany it is very warm in BrittanyWarm enough to learn knittingIf you have religionIf you have a wound and religionIf you have lost your hand and there are womenif you are a woman and have been teachingyou teach knitting you teach knitting to the childrenIn words of pleasure resulting from a union of activity with anticipation and discernment concerning losses a great many people can be rougherSay policman your ears are frozen said the driverYou go to hell was an answerReading and butter there is more than one sayingAnybody can buy sugarAny money can buy sugarIn this country there are a great many disclosuresLet us take a calfTo breed a calf takes the feed for a cowTo wean a calf takes a stallTo learn that calf is killed is too disagreeableLet us give it honeyVeal is allall sunnyNow to continue the narrativeWe have three causes for vindicationThe first is France20 The second is liberty and third is observationYou do observe that there is a reasonBBis indicatedWhen next we see the south we will not expect anybody to deny that birds fly northBirds fly south sometimeand north all togetherWhen this you see remember your sisters in BrittanyA great many of them have no sisters with themSisters can frequently come from the WestWe have guessed that others are equally caressedSinny said of her brothers1 have three brothersOne is in the railroadthe other is a restaurant keeper and the third is a cabinet makerAnd as to the father of my child he is a butcherHe was apprenticed to a butcher and he married the butcher s daughterIn the meantime it is not difficult to realise that a woman who has borne eleven children can easily have a herniaAnd her grandchildHe inherits itFrom his motherWould you be equally satisfied with the queenYes indeed she wouldYes very much indeed she wouldVacaville is a place for cowsVacaville rhymes with whip poor willVacaville is a land of cowsWhip poor will is a birdI recognise a third a third a third place to seeWhen we went visiting we forgot about halosThe saintif you take a photograph of a saint under a tree she has a haloShe said one must reinforce one s selfOne must try to be preparedOne must really speakOne should speak to oneselfBut in the presence of othersOne is not in their presence when one speaks to oneselfYes but if one does recognize the otherThen one must be content to take wagesIn this way she was not satisfiedThe weather was very warmthere was very little wind and no rainI do not neglect my dishesAnd in ParisI found themNow for a conversation21 Margot said to Sinny I do not cause terrorAnd as for me what can I do with my brotherHe is too youngGermaine why does Germaine toilConversation to dayCan we see meatWe prefer coffeeAnd how many sisters do you refuse to seeWe do not refuse to see any sisters but there is one that we prefer not to visit and there is another one that we find disagreeableAnd for the restFor the rest there are a great manyEgyptians Scandinavians and Portugesethe Bretons are more regular than theseThey can spread their anger about most successfullyBut they are not angryTo be sure they are notHow can you copy a letterRead tenderly about how the saint leaving suddenly did not receive her photographI often think that the Queen meant what she said when she said that they had not been so disrespectful no not for two hundred yearsHow can you steal a pinWhy very easily with a hammerI do not know how stupidity is exercisedPlease me to see Please me to see Please me to see IndyPlease me by not seeing a neglected caseHow can you neglect a caseSuppose a mother suddenly singsSupposing a wife sleepsSupposing a brother has meansAnd let us suppose that a husband is curedDo you mean by that completely curedI think I mean by that that a husband is completely curedOf whatOf that to nightI can treat any one like thatBut now to remember what Margot and Germaine and Sinny and the same one and the saint said about playsThey each one said they knew about handkerchiefsThey also believed in comforting themI comfort themLet us have that conversation togetherLet us mean to be tall and strongAnd indeed can we carry a treeIndeed a tree is planted and so are ironsIrons and hills and can you drink waterExplain to me why you drinkIndeed it is so satisfactory that nearly everybody hopes to prayI pray tooCan you see stillCan you still seeIt did workAnd what astonishes me is that it will work again22 Suppose we think a minuteIf it wants to come again will you be indignantNo but disquietedYou

STELLA LA PRIERE D UN ENFANT BY STELLA THE SONG OF THE NIGHTINGALE BY STELLAFERN FACE flowed into her eyesFlowed in soft cream foam and plaintive ripplesin such a way that wherever your glance may momentarily have rested it immediately thereafter wavered in the direction of her eyesThe soft suggestion of down slightly darkenedlike the shadow of a bird s wingthe creamy brown color of her upper lipWhyafter noticing ityou sought her eyesI cannot tell youHer nose was aquiline SemiticIf you have heard a Jewish cantor singif he has touched you and made your own sorrow seem trivial when compared with hisyou will know my feeling when I followed the curves of her profilelike mobile riversto their common deltaThey were strange eyesIn thisthat they sought nothingthat is nothing that was obvious and tangible and that one could seeand they gave the impression that nothing was to be deniedWhen a woman seeksyou will have observedher eyes denyFern s eyes desired nothing that you could give herthere was no reason why they should witholdMen saw her eyes and fooled themselvesFern s eyes said to them that she was easyWhen she was young a few men took herbut got no joy from itAnd thenonce donethey felt bound to herquite unlike their hit and run with other girls felt as though it would take them a lifetime to fulfill an obligation which they could find no name forThey became attached to her and hungered after finding the barest trace of what she might desireAs she grew up new men who came to town felt as almost everyone did whoever saw herthat they woud not be deniedMen were everlastingly bringing her their bodiesSomething inside of her got tired of them I guessfor I am certain that for the life of her she could not tell why or how she began to turn them offA man in fever is no trifling thing to send awayThey began to leave herbaffled and ashamedyet vowing to themselves that someday they would do some fine thing for hersend her candy every week and not let her know who

himAs you know men are apt to idolize or fear what they cannot understandespecially if it be a womanShe did not deny them yet the fact was that they were deniedA sort of superstition above themBeing

it were sunsetrested idly where the sunmolten and gloriouswas pouring down between the fringe of pinesOr maybe they gazed at the grey cabin on the knoll from which an evening folk song was comingPerhaps they followed a cow that had been turned loose to roam and feed on cotton stalks and corn leavesLike as not they d settle on some vague spot above the horizonthough hardly a trace of wistfulness would come to themIf it were duskthen they d wait for the search light of the evening train which you could see miles up the track before it flared across the Dixie Pikeclose to her

the bookbut no art sharks attendedBurton Rascoewho runs the Bookman s Day Book in the New York Tribuneperhaps speaks for them all when challenged for a past valuation of the book he explained that he

werewithout a mark of our own upon itJoyceI have heardrewrotemade corrections and revisions in the proofs of the book itself until the cost of perfection far outstripped all possible returnsUlysses as it appeared in the Little Review is now in demand as a first printingWe have been asked how we ever got a printer in New York to set it for usWe found a Serbian printera man of educationtemperamentand fantastic business methodsHe and his two daughters were the shopHis mother had been the poet laureate of Serbia and heknew the beautiful words He did not ask to be freed from liability in case of trouble with the post officeUlysses was discussed in the shop with easy understanding and acute prideSometimes we were asked in troubled English about certain words Ah yesI knowin Serbia those words are good for the people but in America it is not goodthe people are not brave about wordsthey are not healthy about wordsin America you go in prison But to get back to the reviewsRichard Aldington s was internationally bad and unrelated to UlyssesThen there was John Eglington s piercing blindnessBut the praise is as unthought and as hysterical as the rejectionsThere aren t any critics in this

society in which she playsIf she just wouldn t try to write about it with understandingHow can any one understand anything that one has been part of for years and yearsThe book is in Atherton Glynn styleabout two people who have a tragedy every time they commit some trivial dishonesty or make a social deflectionbut who are given a glimpse of the moon whenever they exchange their behavior for a fundamental crime or stupiditySomething should be said about Ben Hecht s latest efforts GargoylesandFantazius Mallare if he hasn t said it all in his titles Fantaziushas brought the obscene government

question in hand you are apt to miss fireAnd I think you did so in your jeer for Secession in the last LR husky booter that you areNumber 2 Secession had some good stuff in itand you may have noticed

PICASSO IF we knew all the gods would awakenBorn of the profound knowledge which humanity has kept of itselfthe adored pantheisms which resemble it have grown drowsyButdespite the eternal sleep there are eyes where humanities similar to the phantomsjoyous and divineare reflectedThese eyes are as attentive as the flowers whose desire it is always to behold the SunO fertile joyThere are men who see with these eyesAt that time Picasso had looked upon the human images which float in the azure of our memories and partake of divinity to damn the metaphysiciansHow pious are his skiesall alive with flighthis lights low and dull like the light in grottoesThere are children who have gone astray without learning the catechismThey stopand the rain ceases Lookthere are people in these buildings and their garments are poor These children who one does not fondle understand so much Mamalove melove me well They know how to frolic and the turns they make are mental evolutionsToday these women whom

the little children smile because they know they are so goodThey have often given thanks and the gestures of their forearms tremble like their eyeballsEnveloped in frozen mist old men wait unthinkinglyfor it is children only who meditateThese old menanimated by memories of distant countriesby the quarrels of beastsand visions of roughened haircan beg without humilityOther beggars have been used up by lifeThese are the infirmthe cripples and ragamuffinsThey are amazed to have reached the end that has remained bluebut is no longer the horizonGrowing oldthey have become foolish like Kings who have too many troops of elephants carrying little citadelsThere are travelers who confound the flowers and the starsGrown old they die like oxenat twenty fiveThe young have led the sucklings to the moonOn a clear day some women are silenttheir bodies are angelic and their glances trembleAs for danger their smiles are interiorThey wait until frightened to confess innocent sinsFor the space of a year Picasso lived through this damp paintingblue as the humid depths of an abyssand full of pityPity made Picasso harsherThere apeared in the squares one who had been hangedstretched against the houses above the oblique passerbyThose who have been tortured awaited a redeemerMiraculously the gallows overlapped the roofsthe panes flame with the flowers of windowsIn the rooms poor painters drew fleecy nudities by lamp lightA woman s shoes abandoned by the bed signifies a tender hasteCalm came after this frenzyThe harlequins live beneath the faded rags when paint gathers 42 warmth or whitens its colours to tell of the strength and duration of their passionswhen the lines limited by the tights bendcut themselves offor shoot forthIn a square room paternity transfigures Harlequin while his wife bathes herself in cold water and admires herselfas frail and slim as her husband the puppetNearby fire warms the gypsy wagonpretty songs mingle in the air and somewhere passing soldiers curse the dayLove is good when one adorns itand the habit of loving at home doubles the paternal sentimentThe child brings the woman whom Picasso desiredglorious and immaculatecloser to the fatherThe primiparous mothers no longer await the childperhaps because of certain raven like chatterers of ill omenChristmasThey brought forth future acrobats amid familiar monkeyswhite horses and dogs like bearsThe adolescent sisters treading in Equilibrium the great balls of mountebanks ordain to these spheres the radiant movement of worldsThese impubereal adolescents have the solicitudes of innocencethe animals teach them the mystery of religionHarlequins accompany the glory of women whom they resemblebeing neither male nor femaleThe colour has the flatness of frescoesthe lines are firmBut at the extremes of life the animals are human and the sexes undecidedHybrid beasts have the conscience of the demi gods of Egypttaciturn harlequins have foreheads and cheeks withered by morbid sensualityThese mountebanks must not be confounded with actorsTheir observer must be pious for they celebrate mute rites with difficult agilityIt is this which distinguished this painter from the Greek potters whose designs he sometimes simulatedOn the painted pottery bearded and loquacious priests offered in sacrifice animals who are resigned and without destinyHere the virility is beardless but manifests itself in the nerves of their arms of the flat parts of the face and the animals are mysteriousPicasso s taste for the line which fleeschanges and penetrateshas produced examples almost unique of linear dry points where he has not altered the general aspect of the world43 This Malaguegne bruised us like a brief coldHis meditations bare themselves in silenceHe came from afarfrom the richness of composition and of brutal decoration of the Spaniards of the 17th CenturyAnd those who knew him recall the rapid truculences which were already past the point of experimentsHis insistence upon the pursuit of beauty has since changed everything in artThenseverely he questioned the universeHe accustomed himself to the immense light of depthsAnd sometimes he has not disdained to confide actual objects to the lighta tu penny songa real postage stampa bit of oil cloth on which is printed the caning of a chairThe art of the painter would not add a single picturesque element to the verity of these objectsSurprise laughs savagely in the purity of the lightand it is legitimate that numbersmoulded letters should appear as picturesque elementsnew in artbut long since impregnated with humanityIt is not possible to divine the possibilitiesnor all the tendenciesof an art so profound and minuteThe real object or an illusion is no doubt called upon to play a more and more important roleIt is the inner frame of the picture and marks the limits of its profundityin the same way that the frame marks its exterior limitsImitating the planes to represent volumesPicasso gives to the divers elements which compose the objects an enumeration so completeso sharp that they do not take the shape of the objectthanks to the work of the spectators who are forced to see them simultaneously by the mere reason of their arrangementThis art is it more profound than elevatedIt does not dispense with the observation of nature and acts upon us as familiarly as nature herselfThere are poets to whom the muse dictates their versethere are artists whose hand is guided by an unknown being who makes use of them as of an instrumentFor them there is no 44 fatigue for they do not work and can produce much every hourevery dayin every countryand at any season these are not men but poetic and artistic machinesTheir reason is powerless against themselvesthey do not struggleand their works show no signs of effortThey are not divine and can do without themselvesThey are like prolongations of natureand their work does not pass through the intelligenceThey can arouse emotion without humanizing the harmonies which they exciteThere areon the contraryother poets and other artists who exert themselvesthey turn to naturebut have with her no immediate contactthey must draw everything from within themselvesand no demonno muse inspires themThey dwell in solitude and nothing is expressed but what they have themselves stutteredstuttered so often that they many times make effort after efforttrial after trial to formulate that which they desire to expressMen created in the image of God will one day rest to admire their own workBut what fatiguewhat imperfectionwhat grossnessPicasso was an artist like the firstThere has never been so fantastic a spectacle as the metamorphosis which he underwent in becoming an artist like the secondFor Picasso the design to die formed itself while he was looking at the circumflex eyebrows of his best friendwhich were restlessly jumping up and downAnother of his friends brought him one day to the confines of a mystical country where the inhabitants were at once so simple and so grotesque that one could easily remake themAnd thenreallyanatomy for example no longer existed in arthe had to reinvent itand to execute his own assassination with the science and skill of a great surgeonThe great revolution of the arts which he accomplished almost alone is that the world is his new representationEnormous conflagration45 A new manthe world is his new representationHe enumerates the elementsdetails them with a brutality which also knows how to be graciousIt is a newborn infant who puts order in the universe for his own personal useand to the end also of facilitating his relations with his fellow menThis enumeration has the grandeur of an epic poemand with order the drama will burst into flowerOne may contest a systeman ideaa datea resemblancebut I do not see how one can contest the simple act of enumeratingFrom the plastic point of view it might be that he would have been able to get on without so much of the truthbut this truth once seen it became necessaryAnd then there are countriesA grotto in a forest where one cut capersa trip on a donkey to the edge of a precipiceand the entry into a village where everything smells of warm oil and rancid wineOr again the expedition to a cemeterythe purchase of a beaded wreatha wreath of immortelsand the mention ofMille Regretswhich is inimitableI have also heard of candelabra in glazed clay which were so applied upon canvas that they seemed to spring from itPendants of crystaland that famousReturn from Havre As for meI am not afraid of Art nor have I a single prejudice as to the paintersmaterialThe Mosaicists paint with marble or woods of different coloursAn Italian artist has been mentioned who paints with fecal matterduring the French Revolution some one painted with bloodOne may paint with anything he wisheswith pipeswith postage stampswith post cardsor playing cardswith candelabrawith bits of oil clothwith collarscoloured paperor newspapersFor me it is enough to see the workthe work must be seen for it is by the quantity of work furnished by the artist that the value of a work of art is measuredDelicate contrastsparallel linesthe trade of a workingmansometimes even the object itselfsometimes an indication of itsometimes an enumeration which individualizes itselfless of sweetness than of coarsenessOne does not choose in the modernas one accepts fashionwithout discussing itPainting an astonishing art whose light is illimitable46 GEORGES BRAQUE PEACEFUL appearances in plastic generalizationthis is whatin a temperate regionthe art of Georges Braque has joined togetherGeorges Braque is the first of the new painters to renewafter his aesthetic metamorphosishis contact with the publicThis important event took place at the Salon des Indépendants in 1908Today the historic role played by the Salon des Indépendants begins to be clearly definedThe art of the 19th Century the art by which the integrity of French genius hasonce againshown itselfis one long revolt against academic routine to which the rebels opposed the authentic traditions which escape the masters of that degenerate art which defends the citadel of the rue BonaparteThe Salon des Indépendants has played since its foundation a preponderating role in the evolution of modern artIt has revealed to us in turn the tendencies and personalities which have for twenty five years composed the history of French paintingToday it is the only school which countsand which pursues in the presence of the universe the logic of great traditions and shows a great intensity of lifeIt is but proper to add that the grotesque does not appear in the Salon des Indépendants in any larger proportion than it does under the guise of so called legitimate art in the official salonsFor the rest the artistic culture of our days no longer rises from social disciplineAnd it was not the least of the merits of the art manifested in 1908 in a work of Georges Braque that it was in accord with the society in which his evolution has taken placeThis featurewhich had not appeared since the good period of Dutch paintingconstitutes in sum the social element of the Revolution for which Georges Braque was the spokesmanIt would have appeared two or three years earlierif Picasso 47 had exhibitedbut silence was necessary for himand who knows whether the mockeries of which Georges Braque was the butt would not have caused a Picasso to turn aside from the difficult path whereinat firsthe had walked all aloneButin 1909the revolution which renewed the plastic arts was an accomplished factThe pleasantries of the public and of the critics could no longer hinder itMore astonishing perhaps than the novelties which appeared in the pictures of Georges Braque was the fact that one of the young painterswithout abandoning himself to the affectations of the illustrators had restored to honour the order and craftsmanship without which there is no artHere then is Georges BraqueHis role was heroicHis art peaceful and admirableHis exerts himself seriouslyHe expresses a beautya beauty full of tendernessand the pearl like quality of his pictures irridiates our understandingHe is an angelic painterHe has taught men and other painters the aesthetic use of forms so unknown that only a few poets had suspected themThese luminous signs glow around usbut only a few painters have disentangled their plastic significanceWorkmanshipabove all in its grossest realisationscontains a multitude of aesthetic elements whose novelty is always in accord with the sentiment of the sublimewhich permits man to order chaosthat which appears new must not be despisednor that which is dirtynor that which we usethe imitation wood or marble of house paintersEven if these appearances seem trivial a man mustwhen the action requires itbegin with these triflesI detest artists who are not of their epochandjust as the language of the people wasfor Malherbethe proper language of his periodthe workmanship of the artisanof the house painters should be for the artist the most vigorous material expression of paintingm m Georges Braque should be called the verifierHe has verified all the novelties of modern art and he will verify yet more48MARIE LAURENCIN ALBERT GLEIZES PABLO PICASSO JEAN METZINGER GEORGES BRAQUE JEAN METZINGER NO one of

discretion of the contrasted lights a style which sets them apartand perhaps even above the most of the works of the painters who are his contemporariesNo painter makes me think of Molière as does Seuratof the Molière of theBourgeois Gentilhomme which is a ballet full of gracelyricism and good senseAnd canvasses like theCirqueor theChahutare also ballets full of gracelyricism and common senseThe Neo Impressionist painters are those whoto cite Paul Signac have since 1886 inaugurated and developed the socalled technique of division in employing as a means of expression an optical mixture of tones and shades This technique might recall the art of the Byzantine mosaicistsand I remember that one dayin a letter addressed to MCharles MoriceSignac also referred to the Libreria of SiennaThis techniqueso luminous in itselfand which set in order the impressionistic noveltieswas divined and also applied by Delacroixto whom it had been revealed by a study of the pictures of ConstableIt was Seuratwho in 1886 exhibited the firstdividedpictureUn Dimanche à la grande Tatte It was he who carried furthest the contrast of complementary colours in the compo49 sition of picturesThe influence of Seurat is felt today even at the Beaux Artsand will still further vitalise paintingJean Metzinger played a role among the clever and laborious divisionistsHowever the coloured minutiae of the Neo Impressionists were only used to indicate what elements formed the style of an epoch whichto contemporary eyesappeared in nearly all its aspectsboth industrial and artisticto be devoid of itSeuratwith a precision which might be called geniushas drawn certain pictures of his epoch in which the firmness of the style is equalled by the almost scientific clearness of the conception Le ChahutLe Cirque which almost belong toscientific cubismHe assembled everything in the art of his time to fix the gestures which characterize this fin de sièclethis end of the 19th Century where all was angularenervatedpuerilely insolent and sentimentally comicSo beautiful an intellectual spectacle could never be prolongedand once the picturesque style which disengages itself from the art of the 19th Century had been indicatedNeoImpressionism ceased to play an interesting roleIt brought no noveltiesother than the contrast of complementary coloursand indicated the esthetic value of the novelties which the preceding schools had discovered since the end of the 18th CenturyToo many new elements solicited the young paintersThey could not immobilise themselves in an art whichbeing the last and strictest expression of an artistic periodhadwith the first strokegiven its full artistic measureThis discipline became a tiresome ruleThe loud coloured shrieks of the Fauves were bursting out in the distanceThey attracted Jean Metzingerandwithout doubtopened up for him the symbolic significance of the colours and the forms which they representAnd when the Barbarians had left that barbarous but unsavage city given over to luxury and violent orgiesand the Fauves had ceased to bellowthere remained nothing but peaceful bureaucrats who resembled feature for feature the functionaries of the rue Bonaparte at ParisThen the kingdom of the Fauves whose civilization had appeared so newso 50 powerfulso startlingtook on suddenly the aspect of a deserted villageH It was then that Jean Metzingerjoining Picasso and Braquefounded the Cubist CityThe discipline there is strictbut does not yet run the risk of becoming a systemand freedom is greater there than anywhere elseFrom his association with the Neo ImpressionistsJean Metzinger has kept a taste for minutiae a taste by no means mediocreThere is nothing incomplete about his worksNothing which is not the fruit of a rigorous logicand if he has ever been mistakenwhich is something I do not knownor care to knowit has not been by chanceWhen one wishes to explain the art of our epochhis work will be one of the surest documentsIt is thanks to the pictures of Metzinger that a point of departure can be made between that which has an aesthetic value in our art and that which has notA painting of Metzingers always contains its own explanationThat is perhaps a noble weaknessbut it is certainly the result of a lofty conscienceand isI believea case unique in the history of artFrom the moment that one approaches a picture of Metzinger s one feels that the artist has had a firm resolve to take seriously only that which is seriousone feels thatin accordance with a method which seems to me excellentevents furnish him with the plastic elements of his artButeven if he accepts them allhe does not use them haphazardlyHis work is sanemore so no doubt than that of most of his contemporariesHe will charm those who love to know the reason of thingsand these reasons have the qualities necessary to satisfy the mindThe works of Jean Metzinger have purityhis meditations take beautiful forms whose harmony tends to approach the sub51 limeThe new ensembles which he composes are entirely stripped of all that was known before himHis art always more and more abstractbut always agreeableapproaches and seeks to resolve the most difficult and unexpected problems of aestheticsEach one of his pictures contains a judgment of the universe and his entire work resembles a nocturnal firmament when it is clearfree from all clouds and trembling with adorable lightsThere is nothing incomplete in his workspoetry ennobles the smallest detailsALBERT GLEIZES THE works of Albert Gleizes are powerful harmonieswhich must not be confounded with the theoretical cubism devised by the scientific paintersI recall his essaysIn them his desire to bring back his art to his simplest elements could already be feltAt his début Albert Gleizes found himself face to face with flourishing schoolsthe last impressioniststhe symbolistssome of whom had become intimiststhe neo impressionistsdivisionistsFauves he was almost in the situation in which the custom house officer Rosseau found himself face to fact with the academic and intellectual qualities of the official salonsIt was then that he understood the works of Cézannewho had influenced the first CubistsThen those harmonies developed which are among the most serious results which the plastic arts which have produced for the last ten yearsand the most worthy of attentionThe portraits of Albert Gleizes show sufficiently that in his artas in the art of most of the new paintersthe individualisation of the objects is not solely the work of the spectatorsThe pictures of Albert Gleizes and those of many of the young artists are often regarded as timid generalisationsAnd yet in most of the new pictures the individual characters are marked with a decisiona minuteness evenwhich could not escape those who have seen the new painters at work or who have studied their paintings with a little attentionSoft generalization is rather a trait of the intellectual painter 52 of the decadenceWhat individual characters are there in the paintings of a Henry de Grouxwho generalizes the decadent sentiment of the imitators of Baudelaireor in the pictures of a Zuloagawho generalizes the conventional Spain of the last romanticsTrue generalization goes with a more profound individulisationwhich lives in the light as in the pictures of the Impressionists in the style of Claude Monetor of Seurator of Picasso himselfthese artists generalize their sincerity and have renounced the defining of superficial characteristicsThere is not a treea houseor a personnage whose individual characteristics the impressionists have keptIt was an impressionist painter whobefore starting a portraitannounced that he would not make a mere likenessBut there is a generalisation at once vaster and more preciseIt is thus that portrait painting is one of the important branches of the art of the new paintersThey can always guarantee the likeness and I have never seen one of their portraits which was not a resemblanceWhat regard for the reality of the individual characters could painters like Bouguereau have hador HennerWith many of the new painterseach plastic conception is again individualised in the generalisation with a patience which must be recognizedBecause they do not concern themselves with chronologyor historyor geographybecause they bring together that which had never been brought together beforebecause a Gleizes attemptsin disengaging the elements of artistic emotionto dramatise the objects which he depictsone might say that the goal of their art has a sublime precisionAll the figures in the pictures of Albert Gleizes are not the same figuresall the treesa treeall the riversa riverbut the spectatorif he can rise to general ideasmight very well generalize this figurethis treethis riverbecause the work of the painter has raised these objects to so superior a degree of plasticitya degree of plasticity such that all the elements which constitute the individual characters are represented with the same dramatic majestyMajestythis is whatabove allcharacterizes the art of Albert 53 GleizesHe thus brings a startling innovation to contemporary artSomething that before him was found in but few of the modern paintersThis majesty arouses and provokes the imaginationconsidered from the plastic point of viewit is the immensity of thingsThis art is vigorousThe pictures of Albert Gleizes are realised by a force of the same sort as that which realised the Pyramids and the Cathedralsthe constructions in metalthe bridges and the tunnelsThese works have sometimes a slightly awkward aspect like the great works which humanity rates highest because trulythe aim of him who produces them is always to do the best possible workAnd the highest aim an artist can have in his work is to do his bestAnd he is base indeed who contents himself by succeeding in his work without effortwithout workwithout having done the very best that he couldOUR epoch has permitted feminine talents to flourish in art Women bring to art a new vision full of the joy of the universeThere have been women painters in every age and this marvelous art offers to the mind and the imagination such delicate charms that one would not have been astonished had there been an even greater number of women painters16th Century Italy produced SophonisbaAngussolacelebrated by Lanzi and VassariPaul IV and the King of Spain disputed for her worksThey are to be found in MadridFlorenceGenoa and LondonThe Louvre has noneBorn at Cremonaabout 1530she quickly excelled her master Bernardino and carried far the art of portrait paintingThe moderns have occasionally attributed some of her portraits to Titian himselfAfter having achieved the greatest success at the Court of Philip II she ended by retiring to Genoawhere she became blindLanzi says that she passed for the best thinker on art of her Centuryand Van Dyckwho came to hear MLLEMARIE LAURENCIN 54 her affirmed that he had learned more from this blind old woman than from the keenest sighted painterSophonisba Angussola isup to the present timethe most notable example of feminine glory achieved in the plastic artsMlleMarie Laurencin has known how to expressin the major art of paintingan entirely feminine aestheticIt could be divined from her first paintingsdrawings and etchings although these attempts were signalized only by a certain natural simplicity that the artist who was soon to reveal herself would one day express the grace and charm of the worldThen she painted pictures in which the arabesque turned into delicate figuresEver sincethrough all her studiesthis feminine arabesquethe knowledge of which she has managed to keep intactcan always be foundWhile a Picasso preoccupies himself with exalting the hitherto unknown picturesqueness of an object to make it render all that it can give of an aesthetic emotionMlleLaurencinwhose art is derived from that of Henri Matisse and Picassodevotes herselffirst of all to expressing the picturesque novelty of objects and figuresHer art is consequently less severe than that of Picassowith whose artneverthelesshers is not without analogyThis anology lies in the enumeration of the elements which compose the pictureThus she adheres to naturestudying it intentlybut carefully avoiding all that is neither young nor gracefuland she accepts the unknown elements of things only when they have a youthful aspectI think that it is with deliberate design that she has turned her artwhether grave or gayto the young and newFeminine aestheticswhichup to the presenthave never shown themselves except in the applied artssuch as lace and embroideryhad to expressabove all in paintingthe very freshness of this femininityLater other women will come who will explore still other feminine aspects of the universeAs an artist MlleLaurencin may be placed between Picasso 55 and Le Douanier RosseauThis is not a hierarchical indication but a simple statement of relationshipHer art danceslike Salomebetween that of Picassowho like a new John the Baptist bathes all the arts in a baptism of lightand that of Rosseaua sentimental Heroda sumptuous and puerile old man whom love led to the outskirts of intellectualismwhere the angels came on heavy wings to distract his grief and prevent him from penetrating into the frightful kingdom of which he had become Le Douanierand finally they admitted the old man to their midstLe jeunesse artistique have already borne witness to the honour in which they hold the works of what that poor old angelHenri RosseauLe Douanierwho died toward the end of the summer of 1910He might also be called the Master of Plaisanceas much on account of the quarter in which he lived as for the reasons which make his pictures so agreeable to contemplateFew artists have been more mocked at during their life than Le Douanierand few men opposed a calmer front to the railleries and insults with which he was drenchedThis courteous old man always maintained the same tranquil humorandby a happy turn in his characterhe managed to find even in the mockeries and insults an evidence of the interest which even the most malevolent were obliged to take in his workThis serenitybe it well understoodwas only prideLe Douanier was conscious of his powerHe happened once or twice to say that he was the ablest painter of his timeand it is possible that to a certain extent he was not so very much mistakenIt is trueand this can be feltthat he lacked in his youth an artistic educationbut laterwhen he desired to painthe contemplated the masters with passion and it seems that he has been almost alone among the moderns to divine their secretsHis defects consistedand then only at timesof an excess of sentimentof a popular good humour above which he could not riseand which contrasted somewhat sharply with his artistic enterprises and the attitude he had been able to take in contemporary artBut against these defects what qualities he hadAnd it is indeed significant that le jeunesse artistique understood these 56 qualitiesHe can be congratulated especially if his intention was not only to honour but to garner themLe Douanier went to the very end with his picturessomething very rare todayOne finds in them no mannerismsno mode of procedureno systemTherein lies the variety of his workHe did not mistrust his imagination any more than he did his handTherein lies the grace and the richness of his decorative compositionsAs he had taken part in the Mexican campaignhe kept a very precise plastic and poetic recollection of tropical vegetation and faunaThe result has been that this Bretonold inhabitant of the outskirts of Parisis without doubt the strangestthe most audacious and the most charming painter of the exoticHisSnake Charmershows this well enoughBut Rousseau was not only a decoratornor an image maker eitherhe was a painterAnd it is this that for some people makes a comprehension of his work so difficultHe had orderas is shown not only in his pictures but in his drawings which are as methodical as Persian miniaturesHis art had clearnessas is shown in his feminine figuresin the composition of his treesand in the harmonious song of the different shades of the same colora style which belongs only to the French paintersand which distinguishes the French pictures wherever they are foundI speakof courseof the pictures of mastersThe will of this painter was of the strongestHow can this be doubted in the face of his minuteness which was not feeblenesshow can it be doubted before the song of the bluesthe melody of the whites in thatNoce where the figure of an old peasant makes one think of certain Dutch picturesAs a painter of portraitsRousseau is incomparableA half length portrait of a woman in blacks and delicate greys is carried even further than a portrait by CézanneTwice I had the honour of being painted by Rousseau in his littlelight studiorue PerrelI have often seen him work and I know the care he bestowed on all the detailsthe faculty he had of keeping the original and definite conception of his picture until he had completed itandalso how he left nothingabove all nothing essentialto chance57 Among the beautiful sketches by Rousseauthere is none so astonishing as the litle canvas entitledLa Carmagnole It is the sketch for the centenaire de 1 Independance under which Rousseau wroteAuprès de ma blonde Qu il fait bonfaitfait bon The varietythe charmthe delicacy of the tones make this little sketch an excellent bit of nervous designHis flower pictures show the resources of charm and emphasis which were in the soul and hand of the old DouanierIt may be remarked in passing that the three painters between whom I establish no hierarchybut simply seek to discern the degree of relationshipare all portrait painters of the highest orderIn the genial work of Picassoportraits occupy an important place and some of themthe portrait of MVollardand the portrait of MKahnweilerwill rank among the masterpiecesThe portraits of Douanier Rousseau seem to be prodigious works whose full beauty it is as yet impossible for us to measurePortraits form also an important part of the work of MlleLaurencinThe prophetic element in the work of a Picasso and the intellectual element which entersin spite of everything into the work of Rousseauthe work of an old manfinds itself transfigured in MlleLaurencin into an entirely new picturesque elementIt is analogous to the dance and is a rhythmic enumerationinfinitely gracious in paintingHere we find everything which has so far made for the originality and delicacy of the feminine arts in laceembroidery and the tapestry of Bayeux transfigured and glorifiedFeminine art has become a major art and will no longer be confused with masculine artFeminine art is bravecourteous and gayIt dances in the light and languishes in memoryIt has never known imitationit has never descended to the servility of perspectiveIt is a happy artApropos ofLa Toiletteone of MlleLaurencin s tenderest canvasesMMario Meunierthen secretary to MRodinand 58 excellent translator of SaphoSophocles and Plato told an amusing anecdoteHe showed the sculptor some photographs of pictures of the School of the FauvesBy chance there was also among them a reproduction of a picture by MlleLaurencin At any rate said the illustrious old man here is one who is only afauvette she knows what grace isShe is serpentine That is just itfeminine painting is serpentineAnd it is perhaps that great artist in colour and movementLoie Fullerwho was the forerunner of the feminine art of todaywhen she invented the successive lights in which were mingled

originate anything themselves and thinking that what we are doing is a hoaxthey in their turn are trying to put over the hoax of the primitivesThey hope that this painting of long ago is sufficiently forgotten to become again the fashion but in that case it would be the true primitives that would be noticed and not those who imitate them conscientiouslywith a great naïvetéa naivete which unfortunately has nothing to do with that of the good custom house officerRousseauOn the other hand according to Signacthe winners of the Prix de Rome pattern themselves after Van Dongenpoor winners and the revolutionists after Paolo UccelloTruly the cubists can rejoicethere are fine days ahead for themAll things considered I prefer the strained attempts at originality of Picasso to the sugary postal cards of Signacand Braque has certainly more freshness than Luc Albert Moreauwho uses colour as a glazier uses cement to fix window panes Good paintingdoesn t imitate something already done good paintingisn t a matter of squeezing out tubes of paint on a canvasSegonzacwho exhibited some cows standing in a meadowwas much surprised to find them at the end of the exhibition lying on the edge of the frameThe colour had quietly run and made quite a pretty bas reliefThegood paintingdoes not selldoes not exist even at the risk of displeasing the picture merchantsthat which does exist is the man who has something to say and who uses the medium of painting the artistic mediumas it is called to express his personalityHenri Matissefor exampledoes the contraryHenri Matisse is a painterhe loves paintinghe uses all the old trickswhich to him mean paintinghe doesn t make the mistake of thinking that like the sunwhich is neither electricity nor candle nor gas jet nor oil lamp but only lightart is only a mirror in which life is reflected and which it is impossible to put into bottles with labelsHenri Matisseafter having astonished and charmed us by a slight sympathetic audacity is now content to be merely a good artist painterlike VuillardBonnard or Roybetfrom morning till night he paints little canvases and startles the shopkeepers by the size of his collection and seems always to say This will prove good luck to the collectorit s very prettyvery expensive but he promises that it will sell for more than it costIn shortit is the kind of painting for MSacha Guitry or the young American girl too ill to play tennisHenri Matisse is only a good workmanhe thinks that making a picture is the same as manufacturing a table or a clockCertainly the image reflected by the mirror Artof which we spoke a moment agomust be a marvellousi sensibility and change continually and since it is life which it representsit is impossible for certain people to seize it the spirit of an epoch is like the pollen of a flowerif you do not know how to create it and if you touch it there will remain upon your fingers a little yellow or rosebut the flower will have lost its beauty only celluloid flowers are capable of resisting the touch of certain hands61 The pictures of Matisse are flowers without pollen he has not yet urinated the ocean of old conventions and it is indeed a pity that he believes himself too much of a success to lose all audacitynot to dare to empty his bladder swelled up by his box of coloursPaul Signac is delighted that the cubist black is fadingonly because he hope9 to see the return of the petits points it is true that the return of the fashion of shearing poodles like lions is predicted this winterHe seeks the lightit appearsit existsit is certainbut it has nothing to do with the white of silvera picture may be luminous painted with the black of ivoryas an entirely white picture may remain as obscure as the brain of certain bungling masonsThe personality which springs from a system can no more interest us than that of a maniac who could only write with orange ink everyone would recognize from whom his letters came but I doubt if their sheer monotony could interest anyoneThe pictures of Signac remind us of the colour merchants in the Galerie BernheimHis position as president of a salonso called independentwould only offer a guarantee of his merchandise if he were manufacturer of putteesAhcertainly I prefer the cubism of Picasso and of Braque in 1913which represented the spirit of that period which showed up the senselessness of thespotswhose only exponent with any interest was Seuratthe pity is that many people do not yet see how much creative spirit there was in these two menthey confound them with the group of idiots who followed in their wake in the hope of profiting by the stir made by these two namesIt was the same with Impressionism SisleyPissaroRenoir at his best but followed by

all that they like and accept only that which horrifies them in this way we should perhaps have an exhibition less stupid and less monotonous and some innovators would run the risk of having the great luck to exhibit in a gallery consecrated to the glory of French art and considered a public utilityFRANCIS PICABIA 62MSTEINERT and SONS Steinert Hall162 Boyleston StBoston PLAY WRITING A professional
