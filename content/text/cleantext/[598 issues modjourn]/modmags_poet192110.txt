moon blotches on the walls  The yellow rocked across the still façades Or else sat spinning on the pinnacles While he imagined humming sounds and sleep  The walker in the moonlight walked alone And each black window of the building balked His loneliness and what was in his mind   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  If in a shimmering room the babies came Drawn close by dreams of fledgling wing It was because night nursed them in its fold  Night nursed not him in whose dark mind The clambering wings of birds of black revolved Making harsh torment of the solitude  The walker in the moonlight walked alone And in his heart his disbelief lay cold His broad brimmed hat came close upon his eyes  FROM THE MISERY OF DON JOOST  I have finished my combat with the sun And my body the old animal Knows nothing more  The powerful seasons bred and killed And were themselves the genii Of their own ends  Oh but the very self of the storm Of sun and slaves breeding and death The old animal  The senses and feeling the very sound And sight and all there was of the storm Knows nothing more   Wallace Stevens  THE DOCTOR OF GENEVA  The doctor of Geneva stamped the sand That lay impounding the Pacific swell Patted his stove pipe hat and tugged his shawl  Lacustrine man had never been assailed By such long rolling opulent cataracts Unless Racine or Bossuet held the like  He did not quail A man so used to plumb The multifarious heavens felt no awe Before these visible voluble delugings  Which yet found means to set his simmering mind Spinning and hissing with oracular Notations of the wild the ruinous waste  Until the steeples of his city clanked and sprang In an unburgherly apocalypse The doctor used his handkerchief and sighed  GUBBINAL  That strange flower the sun Is just what you say Have it your way  The world is ugly And the people are sad   That tuft of jungle feathers That animal eye Is just what you say  That savage of fire That seed Have it your way  The world is ugly And the people are sad  THE SNOW MAN  One must have a mind of winter To regard the frost and the boughs Of the pine trees crusted with snow  And have been cold a long time To behold the junipers shagged with ice The spruces rough in the distant glitter  Of the January sun and not to think Of any misery in the sound of the wind In the sound of a few leaves  Which is the sound of the land Full of the same wind That is blowing in the same bare place   Wallace Stevens  For the listener who listens in the snow And nothing himself beholds Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is  TEA AT THE PALAZ OF HOON  Not less because in purple I descended The western day through what you called The loneliest air not less was I myself  What was the ointment sprinkled on my beard What were the hymns that buzzed beside my ears What was the sea whose tide swept through me there  Out of my mind the golden ointment rained And my ears made the blowing hymns they heard I was myself the compass of that sea  I was the world in which I walked and what I saw Or heard or felt came not but from myself And there I found myself more truly and more strange  THE CUBAN DOCTOR  I went to Egypt to escape The Indian but the Indian struck Out of his cloud and from his sky   This was no worm bred in the moon Wriggling far down the phantom air And on a comfortable sofa dreamed  The Indian struck and disappeared I knew my enemy was near I Drowsing in summer s sleepiest horn  ANOTHER WEEPING WOMAN  Pour the unhappiness out From your too bitter heart Which grieving will not sweeten  Poison grows in this dark It is in the water of tears Its black blooms rise  The magnificent cause of being The imagination the one reality In this imagined world  Leaves you With him for whom no phantasy moves And you are pierced by a death   Wallace Stevens  OF THE MANNER OF ADDRESSING CLOUDS  Gloomy grammarians in golden gowns Meekly you keep the mortal rendezvous Eliciting the still sustaining pomps Of speech which are like music so profound They seem an exaltation without sound Funest philosophers and ponderers Their evocations are the speech of clouds So speech of your processionals returns In the casual evocations of your tread Across the stale mysterious seasons These Are the music of meet resignation these The responsive still sustaining pomps for you To magnify if in that drifting waste You are to be accompanied by more Than mute bare splendors of the sun and moon  OF HEAVEN CONSIDERED AS A TOMB  What word have you interpreters of men Who in the tomb of heaven walk by night The darkened ghosts of our old comedy Do they believe they range the gusty cold With lanterns borne aloft to light the way Freemen of death about and still about To find whatever it is they seek Or does   That burial pillared up each day as porte And spiritous passage into nothingness Foretell each night the one abysmal night When the host shall no more wander nor the light Of the steadfast lanterns creep across the dark Make hue among the dark comedians Halloo them in the topmost distances For answer from their icy Elysée  THE LOAD OF SUGAR CANE  The going of the glade boat Is like water flowing  Like water flowing Through the green saw grass Under the rainbows  Under the rainbows That are like birds Turning bedizened  While the wind still whistles As kildeer do  When they rise At the red turban Of the boatman   Wallace Stevens  HIBISCUS ON THE SLEEPING SHORES  I say now Fernando that on that day The mind roamed as a moth roams Among the blooms beyond the open sand  And that whatever noise the motion of the waves Made on the sea weeds and the covered stones Disturbed not even the most idle ear  Then it was that that monstered moth Which had lain folded against the blue And the colored purple of the lazy sea  And which had drowsed along the bony shores Shut to the blather that the water made Rose up besprent and sought the flaming red  Dabbled with yellow pollen red as red As the flag above the old café And roamed there all the stupid afternoon  Wallace Stevens   FROM CITY LANES  The dawn comes to me sweetly as a soft new child Leans with its soul to drain a bit of milk And I am new O gray old city Lift your head a moment from the pots and streets Wash over me your meaning as a flask of fire Tipped and spilled over at the altar s base  There are new augurings that go in blue gray smoke Up from your shops New Ups that rain a torrent in me as of words Be still a moment city while the dawn tells tales  CITY WED  I lie by the bricks at night Do you think I am lying by you And this is your breast I lean against No Bricks are my lord With them I shall procreate Until I wake some morning with my litter of stone  Not that I want to lie with bricks O beloved of the white limbs and strong neck But how can I help it when they come tumbling These bricks that come fumbling At my breast   Loureìne Aber  IF  If it were not for this dream upon me I should make my coin I should grind my way to fortune with the little wheels I should count the flying heels my slaves to bind I should count the eardrums and the fingers mine But I keep thinking I can touch the sky With my lips  ELEVATOR MAN  You in your little cage and I in mine Elevator man We will pierce the wide world s heaven Far as we can You to go up and down beating up and down I to brush my wings off On the walls of Merchant Town  BEREFT  O my country I am crying to you piteously as a hungry bird I am crying to you for your beautiful ports And harbors For the slow beauty of your Statue and its silent hope O my country I would slink into the crevices of your  egoism And squat on the doormat of your excellences   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But what shall I do when mad spring comes And blossoms come And wild sap comes But my lover comes not  O my country I might be a thin thread in your flag Or the little wind blowing your ships to sea But what shall I do when the spring comes in And flowers shoot up in me  OLD MAN  Dawn sprang wildly to her lips And the little hard breasts burst as a waterfall over the  rocks I the dark pine at the precipice edge Lunged and was still Then swiftly as wild birds go to the kill Toppled and ran with her youth to the sea  They said I was wanton and cruel To have taken her youth at the height To have matched the great might Of my years With her slender beauty and tremulous fears  I tell you I lunged and was still Then swiftly as wild birds go to the kill   Loureine Aber  Toppled and ran with her youth to the sea Pity me  GIRL  Dreamily girl  Duskily night Cover your dead  Make a plot by the old stream s head Plant him and pray  Till worlds make way  And the blooms come  Duskily night  Dreamily girl  DEATH  I am waiting for the white winds to come  White with the long whispering dust Withered under hoofs and feet White with the mountains that blow their sleep  Into the sea  I am waiting for the white winds to come  Lifting their hands as beautiful women clad for the moon  And soon ah soon  Lifting my heart to be ashes and wind Loureine Aber   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  JOY  Joy Joy run over me  Like water over a shining stone  And I beneath your sweet shall be  No longer hungry and alone  The light at my heart s gate is lit  My love my love is tending it  CEREMONY  The unpeopled conventional rose garden Is where I shall take my heart With this new pain Clipped hedge and winter covered beds Shall ease its hurt When it has grown quiet I shall mount the steps slowly And put three sorrows in the terra cotta urn On that low gate pillar And leave them there to sleep Beneath the brooding stillness of a twisted pine  FIRST COMER  Gold bee You cling too still and drowsily   Maurine Smith  In the frosty noon Think you The dandelion is a sun To warm your body through  WIND  Gulls take veering way Through the fresh day Crisp brown oak leaves whirl and rise Though my heart flies I must go Carefully and slow  Eager is the wind shy As any butterfly I ll not blur life with my frosty breath Nor think again of death  SWALLOWS BRUSH A POOL  Let there be end of talk of good and evil Thirst hunger and the rest Beauty has

blind man wears The calloused scar Of outlived despairs Courage is Fear That has said its prayers   Karle Wilson Baker  NOT IN THE WHIRLWIND  Do I speak soft and little Do I offer you a drop of honey in a bent brown leaf Yet I too have been rent by the whirlwind I have lain trembling under its bellowings I have endured its fangs I have heard it hiss and groan Bitterness bitterness But all I have left After its searchings and its rendings May be told in a soft voice And is sweet Sweet Like a drop of thick honey in a bent brown leaf  Karle Wilson Baker  KEEP MY HAND  Keep my hand because I am afraid To be alone I am afraid of all the dreams I made If you were shown  Dream after little dream that I made gay  To keep my spirit strong upon the way  You would hold my hand closer than you do Within your own  Louise Driscoll   UNDER THE CLIFF  SHADOW CANYON  The earth has carved a hollow cup In which most delicately set Tall redwood boughs are lifted up To form a sky enlacing net  There on the ground made green with fern The sunshine lies in pools of light And iris holds a fragile urn With morning s gems of dew bedight  There is no sound but water going And sunlight thrilling through the air There is no breath but breezes blowing And wild quail rustling to their lair  Here is a deep and drowsing haven That woven sun rays pierce and cross And on the peaceful trees are graven The little footprints of the moss  Sweet dreaming canyon shadow bound Yet sunshine stippled all the day The calm skies circle you around But you lie deeper hushed than they   Miriam Alien deFord  THEMES  I remember and I wish Of such stuff are poems fashioned Poems lyric with regret Vibrant poems dream impassioned  In your honor and your praise I would strike a richer chord Sing I have you and am yours O adorer and adored  WILL IT BE LIKE THIS  Will it be like this Climbing the hill at midnight While the rain seeps from the plumaged pepper trees And the damp air is rank with eucalyptus And our little house black and untenanted Soundless where your hurrying footsteps Used to run to the door to greet me Black and cold and I alone there Will that be the way of it On that silent day when I shall begin waiting For Death to release me to you  Miriam Allen deFord   POETRY A Magazine of Verse SIC PASSIM The Angel Now here s the road to Allencourt And here s the road to Tyre And he who goes to Allencourt Is purged of all desire The Youth The Angel But what of him who goes to Tyre Among the cedar trees Why he who goes to Tyre has none But just himself to please While he who goes to

full sincerity And all the peace that God has willed Is the reward eternally  But toll upon the other road Is crucible of burn and freeze For he who goes to Tyre has none But just himself to please  While he who goes to Allencourt Is purged of all desire Lord lead me on to Allencourt For me I go to Tyre   RECALLED  You see it not This Rose of Rhone Has something of the flow Of light like a liquid lacquer on the wall And old Madrid I swear it shone More with your light your glow Than that of the sun Why do your eyelids fall  You hear it not The Prado was A sweeping meadow then The swing of the tunes of time was in your tone No dream comes to you now because You hear my voice again No dream of a youth you passed at dusk alone  Three hundred years you mark them not And yet you loved me then Who now in the light of mullioned windows stand And it is you who have forgot That once O sought of men When I was the king of Spain I kissed your hand  Joseph Andrew Galahad   SEA QUATRAINS  I  Too fast the silly white caps run Their helter skelter races  They stumble when the goal is won And fall upon their faces  A purple light is shaken over The greener ocean shadows  Like clover on the cooler depths Of grass in upland meadows  III The sea hangs kelp upon the sanai Like garlands on a grave Mourning the dead and silent land With every living wave  IV  The breakers thunder in the night With which the sea is drenched Only one plunging line is white Even the stars are quenched v The fairest ship ever a wreck Had not so white a sail As this fair wave cast up to break Driven before the

love s gift loveliest I know not what to do Now sleep has pressed Weight on your eyelids  Shall I break your rest Devouring eager Is love s gift best Nay song s the loveliest Yet were you lost What rapture could I take from song What song were left  I know not what to do To turn and slake The rage that burns With my breath burn And trouble your cool breath So shall I turn and take Snow in my arms Is love s gift best   H D  Yet flake on flake Of snow were comfortless Did you lie wondering Wakened yet unawake  Shall I turn and take Comfortless snow within my arms Press lips to lips that answer not Press lips to flesh That shudders not nor breaks  Is love s gift best Shall I turn and slake All the wild longing Oh I am eager for you As the Pleiads shake White light in whiter water So shall I take you  My mind is quite divided My minds hesitate So perfect matched I know not what to do Each strives with each As two white wrestlers Standing for a match Ready to turn and clutch Yet never shake Muscle or nerve or tendon So my mind waits   To grapple with my mind Yet I am quiet I would seem at rest  I know not what to do Strain upon strain Sound surging upon sound Makes my brain blind As a wave line may wait to fall Yet waiting for its falling Still the wind may take From off its crest White flake on flake of foam That rises Seeming to dart and pulse And rend the light So my mind hesitates Above the passion Quivering yet to break So my mind hesitates above my mind Listening to song s delight  I know not what to do  Will the sound break  Rending the night With rift on rift of rose  And scattered light  Will the sound break at last  As the wave hesitant   H D  Or will the whole night pass And I lie listening awake  SONG  You are as gold As the half ripe grain That merges to gold again As white as the white rain That beats through The half opened flowers Of the great flower tufts Thick on the black limbs Of an Illyrian apple bough  Can honey distil such fragrance As your bright hair For your face is as fair as rain Yet as rain that lies clear On white honey comb Lends radiance to the white wax So your hair on your brow Casts light for a shadow  AT BAIA  I should have thought In a dream you would have brought Some lovely perilous thing Orchids piled in a great sheath    As who would say in a dream I send you this Who left the blue veins Of your throat unkissed  Why was it that your hands That never took mine Your hands that I could see Drift over the orchid heads So carefully Your hands so fragile sure to lift So gently the fragile flower stuff Ah ah how was it  You never sent in a dream The very form the very scent Not heavy not sensuous But perilous perilous Of orchids piled in a great sheath And folded underneath on a bright scroll Some word  Flower sent to flower For white hands the lesser white Less lovely of flower leaf  Or  Lover to lover no kiss No touch but forever and ever this  H D  COMMENT  POETRY AND THE ALLIED ARTS  POETRY would like to celebrate its ninth birthday by inaugurating a closer affiliation with the allied arts of music and the drama perhaps also the dance If the movies and the scarcely less photographic commercial plays are banishing poetry from one end of the stage it must needs go around to the other door and re enter hand in hand with the opera and lyric song with the ballet and perhaps paradoxically symbolic pantomine Times are changing and the arts with them the poet the composer the dancer should prove their pliancy their mobility They should not indeed they cannot stay apart they must get together and co operate and accept each other s influence  At present our poets and composers move in different orbits have scarcely a bowing acquaintance with each other either personally or professionally POETRY would be grateful for suggestions as to the best available method of establishing closer relations  Not long ago Musical America published an article by Charles Albert Case a well known tenor entitled The Quest of the American Song and sub titled A Challenge to Poets rather than Composers Mr Case thinks that the American public wants American songs and that the singers are eager for this change from the usual polyglot programs but that it is impossible to make up   a sufficiently interesting and varied recital without foreign aid And for this condition he thinks our poets are more to blame than our musicians He says  The fact that there are few American songs which are truly great is a challenge to American poets rather than to American composers The question what to sing is the most vital and the most persistently intrusive one that a busy song recitalist has to face Naturally American singers want very much to sing American songs and most of us do sing them but in building our recital programs we invariably find ourselves limited in the number of such songs we can use for we must avoid singing a succession of songs in the same humor and when one is face to face with the assembled material one finds that the contrasting elements which make for essential variety in the group unit are astonishingly lacking  Mr Case then contrasts our meagreness with German  and French richness and continues  Being a loyal American I admit it reluctantly but there is far less variety in American songs even when one plans to choose a group from several different composers than one can find in any single one of the greater German song writers   We have some splendid American songs and some of them are truly noble but most of them are not good enough Many of the most successful of them are settings by other than American poets Some of the best of them are not even in English  Mr Case then reminds us that a good song must unite two arts a fundamental truth which both singers and auditors too often forget He inquires What constitutes a good song and answers his query thus  A good poem adequately set to music There is the whole matter in a nutshell  The many bad American songs are bad either because the text was trivial to begin with or else was carelessly read and consequently inadequately interpreted in music In some cases the text was even   Poetry and the Allied Arts  adapted distorted pinched and pulled into the approximate shape of a ready made melody Ready made melodies are like ready made clothes They fit nobody because they were made to fit everybody  Schubert read Mueller Goethe Heine Rueckert Uhland Shakespeare Schumann read Rueckert Geibel Uhland Eichendorff Moerike Chausson read DeLisle and Gautier These men read the best poetry of their time and they read it with true understanding and genuine respect What greatness there was in them lay largely in their power to discriminate to select fine poetry from the mediocre and then to bend to the task of making worthy musical settings Too often our young Americans write as though they thought the lyrics of which they try to make songs were not good enough for them   I have frequently been asked by young aspiring composers to help them find words to set to music They say You know something you consider singable I haven t time to read This is rank impudence I never offer such people much sympathy I do not think they should be encouraged It seems to me that one must read much poetry to understand a little Reading and reading with unusual intelligence is part of a song writer s job  Thus far Mr Case s indictment accuses the composers  but he concludes with a fling at the poets  I have real sympathy for the trained educated honest intentioned American composer who reads native poets and finds so little to inspire him to exercise his genius Surely his material is limited Eventually we shall have truly noble American songs But first there must be noble American poetry From the mass of it the song writer must choose with a fine exercise of discrimination We have many Americans who have the taste to choose and the ability adequately to set beautiful poetry to music But American song writing is at the same stage of development as American poetry Let us hope that some of the lyrically gifted will start soon to write about something besides the sunset and the skyline from the Jersey shore or the sensation of ascending Woolworth tower in a modern elevator  Now with all due deference to Mr Case and his trained educated honest intentioned American com   poser we doubt whether either one of them has sympathetically investigated the extraordinary range and variety of modern American poetry We doubt whether either one of them having discovered a poet suggestive for his purpose has ever tried to get acquainted with him even if he was a neighbor and discuss this highly interesting esthetic problem on which the future of American song depends  There is among American artists poets musicians and all the others a curious professional aloofness which fights against co operation The architect makes his design the sculptor models his isolated figure the painter paints his easel picture all separate and alone they do not get together as in the Phidian or the Gothic age or the Renaissance to pool their energies and make a grand complete and monumental building In the same infertile way the poet writes his poem apart in his traditional garret and the musician seeking a song poem or a ballet motive or an opera libretto reads in his library uncharted seas of poetry history and romance instead of going where modern poetry is created and swinging into its current so that the two arts may move along together and mutually inspire each other  Among themselves poets and doubtless musicians painters and the rest are free and easy enough in intercourse and criticism But this professional aloofness this shyness comes in the way of attempts at cooperation A distinguished Chicago composer says he   Poetry and the Allied Arts  is very familiar with the work of certain equally distinguished Illinois poets though to his regret he has never succeeded in harnessing up their poetry to his music but we doubt if he has ever attempted to work together with any modern poet in the frank give and take of such a partnership toward the production of a wholly modern and American work of art When I protest against his going back to the nineties for a pseudo romantic motive for a ballet when I suggest Stevens or Kreymborg H D or Edna Millay he answers by what might be called a flank attack  I am very grateful to you for the copies of POETRY which you sent to me containing the Stevens and Kreymborg pieces I like particularly the Three Travelers although I doubt whether I could improve it any with music  It seems to me that the thing we must all remember in talking about an opera libretto is the fact that we must depend for our effect on the poetry or the drama of the action rather than on the poetry or drama of the words Therefore the ideal opera librettist would be the poet gone dumb who by his simple gesture could make us jump through any hoop he pleases  But even if this composer and others are turning toward pantomime and ballet rather than opera preferring the orchestra to the human voice even so they cannot eliminate the poet for though no word be said no song sung the imaginative invention of some poet dead or living must furnish the motive the story the plot And no doubt the ballet of the future will include the poem either as an introductory recitative or a series of lyric perhaps choral interludes as in Rimsky Kor   sakov s ballet opera The Golden Cockerel Thus it is for the composer to choose whether he will be true to his own age and race by linking up with modern poets and deriving his stimulus from imaginations now actively functioning or go back to dead poets for his motive and thereby run the risk of endangering the vitality of his own art of not connecting it up with either the present or the past  But however important ballet and pantomime may prove as motives for modern music it is safe to predict that the human voice will not lose its prestige And it must be safe to predict that the sooner our composers look to their poet neighbors for the texts of opera oratorio cantata song cycle ballad madrigal song instead of searching all ages myths and languages of the past the sooner will our musical art become as up to date and as racially expressive as the musical art of Russia  Something has been done no doubt The present writer would be ungrateful not to recall Mr Chadwick s fine choral and orchestral setting of the lyrics in The Columbian Ode Another effective instance is John Carpenter s beautiful setting of Tagore s lyrics from an early number of POETRY And we are permitted to announce an oratorio which is to be the joint creation of Louise Ayres Garnett and Henry Hadley the text of which will appear under the title Resurgam in POETRY for December But such instances are isolated cases they do not yet represent a general tendency   Poetry and the Allied Arts  If POETRY can do anything toward such a tendency by making poets and composers more aware of each other bringing them more in contact personal and spiritual we should be most happy to offer to the utmost any service in our power And we shall be very glad of discussion and suggestions H M  INFLUENCE OF THE ART THEATRE ON POETIC DRAMA  If the new movement in the theatre had accomplished nothing else it would nevertheless be justified by the release it has brought to poetic drama and to the poetic mood in drama The new movement long since established in continental Europe still struggles precariously in the virgin soil of America It exists however and having existed thus far it probably will continue to exist until in time it flourishes  Meanwhile by the creation of a modern technique it offers poetic drama in English the first justifiable hope of escape from the senile lethargy into which three centuries of imitation had plunged it Strictly speaking there had been no poetic drama since the Puritans stopped the rich stream of Elizabethan eloquence by closing the theatres in 1642 Occasionally a dramatist deriving his method from a compromise between the continentals the Greeks and Shakespeare had made a play in verse or more stagnantly had built a romantic hodge podge verbose and rhetorical around the pseudo realistic   formula of the days of gas lamp illumination But there had been no impetus no technical incentive towards a renascence of poetic drama until the new movement cleansed the theatre by challenging theatric values  To save the theatre said Eleanora Duse the theatre must first be destroyed And the younger men the revolutionists set themselves to destroy it in theory and to recreate it in practice and theory both by the simple but incisive idea of re theatralization No better proof could be offered of the sterility of poetic drama than the fact that these men were all without exception men of the theatre directors scenic artists actors none of them playwrights In other words the new movement differed from any earlier developments of the kind so far as I know in being almost wholly independent of the drama The emphasis was shifted decisively from the drama to the theatre as the dominant art form  Now that habit of mind which insists that the theatre shall be the handmaid of the arts and particularly of the art of writing is apt to view such a transfer of emphasis with alarm For the theatre to assert its own inherent vitality is permissible so long as it does not intrude this vitality into the sacred traditions of the drama But the new movement involves an esthetic too fundamental not to re open the entire problem of dramatic construction Concerned chiefly with the production of the play in the theatre it uncovers an esthetic resource that touches the very definition of poetic drama   Influence of the Art theatre on Poetic Drama  The reform in stagecraft is a protest against the fallacy of a realistic technique against that ineptitude of the mise en scene which has made theatrical a synonym for the imitation of beauty by tinsel and exaggeration It is toward a simplified and therefore an allusive and poetic decoration toward an emotional and therefore a poetic use of light toward a rhythmic and therefore a poetic movement In synthesizing these visual elements into an organic whole the new stagecraft has released in them a dramatic value entirely apart from representation Just as poetry is the rhythmic expression of a theme to be developed by words so these visual elements in the theatre serve both the purpose of representation and of rhythmic beauty Thus the background may be both a statement of locality and a design holding the production in key Movement may be utilized not only for its obvious and objective purpose but also for the intrinsic beauty of motion Light treated emotionally is capable of following emphasizing or even leading the mood of the action  I have attempted briefly to indicate the trend of the new stagecraft because in this discovery of an independent esthetic resource in the visual elements of the theatre originates the essential difference between the new technique and the old as it affects the dramatist The central rhythm of the play instead of being developed through words only is developed through all the media of production through light stage decoration and movement   as well as through the spoken word These visual elements become a part of the inner structure of the play and because of their poetic quality they bind the theatre inseparably to poetry to poetic drama making the theatre a place well fitted for the renascence of poetic drama  But with these additional factors of expression it is no longer necessary for the dramatist to trust so exclusively and cling so tenaciously to words In the Elizabethan drama even the locality of the scene was often stated in words every mood every emotion was projected verbally It was a drama of eloquence and as such it suited as no other form could the torrential flood of Elizabethan poetry But modern poetry irrespective of the drama is more restrained it tends to leave much unsaid to project the meaning by ellipsis and overtones Unless I am mistaken though I know little of the technique of poetry this brevity is sometimes carried to extreme lengths in which the imagination of the reader supplies much more at the poet s instigation than the poet himself expresses It is a subtle technique and it is pre eminently the technique of the dramatist  With this distinction that instead of restraining verbal expression to stimulate the imagination of the reader the dramatist uses words cautiously in adjustment to the other media of his expression To take an obvious and well understood example a gesture is sometimes equal in effectiveness to many words In the theatre where   Influence of the Art theatre on Poetic Drama  economy of expression is imperative gesture and words will often complement each other without duplication And what is true of gesture becomes true in the art theatre of all phases in movement of stage decoration of light and on occasion of music  The effect of this upon the poetry of the poetic drama and especially upon verse structure is significant and far reaching It necessitates the development of a verse form that will admit of distortions interruptions and irregularities These are more apparent than real As soon as the poetic drama is conceived as a fusion of many arts into an organic whole the rhythm of the play becomes an inclusive rhythm to the progression of which all the media are contributory and in a sense subordinate The irregularities in such a drama would be due to the separation of the verse from its theatric context When the play came into being in the theatre these irregularities would disappear merging into the larger current of rhythmic beauty To the dramatist this may seem the weakness or the strength of the new poetic drama that it comes to fulfilment only in the theatre as a symphony lives only in the orchestra  Blank verse which alone of the standard forms has been accepted as a proper medium for the poetic drama in English depends for acceptance upon an insidious flexibility This flexibility serves the purpose of the theatre so long as the characters keep talking But talk they must and the terrified volubility of the poetic drama is   I think one of the reasons why it has been in general a form displeasing to modern audiences This is no fault of blank verse which has been deflected from its original and legitimate intention to serve as best it might an art that lacks its own form It has thus created a compromise between the printed page and the theatre which has made the poetic drama neither fish nor flesh neither wholly satisfactory for reading nor wholly satisfactory for acting  Moreover the need for well rounded periods has reacted upon the dramatist by giving him a false sense of untroubled leisure The time element which scarcely exists in the printed page is in the theatre of the utmost importance The reader may take his own pace the auditor must listen he must accept the pace of the actor The verse is spoken apparently with a retarded movement and must therefore be quantitatively less and more compact for the purpose Such a compactness is hostile one would say judging by examples to the mood of blank verse One need only refer among many instances to the plays of Stephen Phillips or Zoë Akins each of whom has a keen dramatic instinct or to that parody of Elizabethan grandeur that reductio ad absurdum of rhetoric in a theme not without power Caius Gracchus to note the clogging result of the intrusion of the stricter verse forms into the theatre It may almost be stated as a generality that other things being equal the more smoothly a play reads the worse it will act   Influence of the Art theatre on Poetic Urania  A new verse form that will be native to the theatre that will be an inseparable component of the flow of the complex rhythm of the play cannot be created out of hand It too like the modification of painting for stage decoration of illumination for emotional lighting must develop through knowledge of the exigencies of the medium To understand the poetic theatre is to understand the use of poetry in that theatre In America the dramatist has grasped neither the technique nor the possibilities in expression that it offers him Toy plays Columbine plays gay and adolescent trifles thin tragedies all superficial experiments in the externals of the new stagecraft follow one another in an almost but fortunately not quite unbroken succession  In a recent article the most brilliant director that the new movement has produced this side the Atlantic Maurice Browne summarizes thus the situation in respect of finding a drama for the art theatre  A fight which has hardly begun the fight for the play That is where the Chicago Little Theatre failed and where all the artist groups in America have failed except perhaps the Provincetown Players  But it may be true that out of a clearer understanding will come the dramatist who will evolve the form which his medium demands And after him the deluge  Cloyd Head   REVIEWS  MUSEUM SHIPS  Ships in Harbor by David Morton G P Putnam s Sons  What is there in David Morton s verse that seems to save it that intervenes in moments of irritation with its punctual urbanity There is not an original line in it Not one cry one intense expression comes from it one vision that the poet has kept from his privileged dreaming which can draw the mind an inch out of even the shallowest rut  Is it its cleanly manufacture its unstraying measures and kempt familiar figurines To me its charm has been a charm too soon worn out the charm that sometimes attracts us to a diffident guest when we are overborne by the intrusions and ineptitudes of the vivacious when the quiet and subdued deceptively appear to be powerful and profound  It is fatal however to turn closely to the poems themselves for verification They are demure enough but thin and fragile and made with earnest and helpless plagiarism Never the robust piracies of a Shakespeare or Sterne but a pallid imitativeness that paints the past more ruinous with perfunctory restorations and blows about it feeble ghosts pale mute and not recognizable as ghosts should be of any of the shapes of destiny  The book is called Ships in Harbor there is such a poem in the book and other occasional verses on ships But   Museum Ships  the reader who expects salt and storm or anything authentically of the sea should look elsewhere in the dubious prose of Joseph Conrad for instance There are some conventionally nautical words and phrases and the tidy thoughtfulness about mystical things that gives to diffident cornered people their misleading impressiveness It makes David Morton talk twice on successive pages of weightless cargoes and one might add lifeless crews and meaningless uses and tinsel The sea is brought in because it is on the same wall with Greece and Rome spring and patriotism and not being so bent with overuse is more convenient to hang poems upon Sonnets for David Morton writes mostly in sonnets  We agree that grammar is spoken language stagnant out of which nevertheless speech drips and sometimes splashes We agree that rhetoric is literature stagnant that as there can be limitless variations of the correct sentences phrases clauses and what nots of grammar so there can be a limitless variation of forms of rhetoric These verses are rhetoric often skilful and surprising often mildly intricate but never poetry  There should be a word bearing the same relation to subject matter which grammar and rhetoric bear to language Pageant perhaps but pageant is free ringing and dramatic Pageant is play and this other thing pretends solemnly to poetry but uses pageant properties It rounds up all the popular places and heroes the storybook locales and personae and treats them with apologetic   sophistication and with a snuffling sentimentality very wide of the crude romantics of the pageant crowd  The favorite property is the Past After reading this book through a Spartan exercise I turned the pages casually at various places to see whether the Past appeared as often as I thought I read in On Hearing a Bird at Night  Out of what ancient summers of soft airs  Christ Dante Athens Time Roman pyramid Phidias are all in one sonnet called Moments Pan and the Gods are in Redemption and in Encore  This old slow music with dancers who were graceful long ago  Does Mr Morton make a confession in Inviolate  For present loveliness there is no speech A word may wrong a flower or face And stars that swim beyond our stuttering reach Are safer in some golden silent place Only when these are broken or pass by Wonder and worship speak or sing or cry  The thought seems more penetrating than it is If the present and the future are inviolate to the pen of the poet the past is equally so and Mr Morton should quietly take to other things He knows that the past is beautiful only through the poets who recorded its beauty and ugliness The Past is a convention time is a unity and no fragment of it is less alive than another unless one wittingly puts on blinders  To continue our census this from Transfiguration   Museum Ships  What old historic dust gives back the rose What crumbled empires yield the creeping vine  And these from Survival and Ruins  Lead back the tragic chariots of Troy The spring comes in to me like spring in Rome  I might add and so on and so on because Mr Morton s obsession is the Past and it stalks him like a shadow everywhere he goes although the other commonplaces of poetry the ready rapture articles of every variety are not neglected and although he succeeds as little in vitalizing the past as the sea Perhaps for him the sea has run out and the past has been neatly embalmed in a general history There is even a curious indifference about them as if they were a poetaster s shop talk  And oh yes the sonnets are very carefully made They are trim rhythmic proper sonnets in every respect  Isidor Schneider  NEW FIRE  A Canopic Jar by Leonora Speyer E P Dutton amp Co  This is the first book of a mature woman too intelligent to be content with gifts already fulfilled and creations accomplished The book hiding the hidden thing making protection for Hapi who is within indicates careful research into the forms of verse and contains poems in various forms The task of the reviewer is somewhat to disentangle the set of perceptions for which   the development of appropriate rhetoric will yield most to her ambition  Mrs Speyer s ambition is neither historical evangelical nor journalistic but esthetic This in itself is noteworthy It is often said that pursuits and ideas must now be estimated upon their contribution to the war problem the food problem or the proletariat problem If this were true every healthy minded man should strive in a chemical laboratory to find the secret lair of energy which men will control in the good day coming so that drudgery will cease and food and power become so cheap that they will not be worth fighting for  But in the meantime if conviction fails us or an unscientific education has forever limited our activities there is a phase of thought in which a gifted woman may participate as well as a chemist or war correspondent these speculative adventures and flashes of interpretive insight which when fixed in pattern or rhythmic utterance we call art And if art is to remain as vital as protozoology or for that matter as prize fighting its principal concern must be the search for new form its own lairs of energy however useless in the end  In this search Mrs Speyer is engaged For convenient examination of the book I shall take up certain qualities in more or less arbitrary order In the construction of phrase which shall convey precisely a precise idea or impression not a matter of verse technique alone her imagination is deft Occasionally her abstraction is as   New Fire  sharp edged as a tangible object O pompous cry O puny sin These are even stronger and cling to the memory  I am the path that my own feet tread  Gulls flap unevenly through the muffled hours Spaces listen in hiding  Rhythm is of course the special problem of verse Two divisions of it may be dissociated The first indicates an inner logic not otherwise shown or an emotion not otherwise evoked as in traditional or imposed forms The other fuses with the rhythm of the fact as that the old man walked amid the green rye so that the old man may seem to walk Movement is duplicated by movement ofwords Coleridge is full of examples of this  The moving moon went up the sky And nowhere did abide Softly she was going up And a star or two beside  Of this rhythm Leonora Speyer may become a distinguished exponent The lovely after battle poem April on the Battlefield  And birds sit close for comfort On broken boughs  Squall and First Snow on the Hills indicate this ability Curiously although an excellent musician she does not invent musical schemes which are interesting in themselves   The American genius has taken up satire The axe which has rusted since Swift but for such bourgeois holidays as Thackeray afforded is used with new intent and no reformatory zeal The bias given to perceptions by scorn not spleen is recognized to be as true an emotional bias as another and perhaps in a world of newspapers and languid religions the most pertinent of all In her speech Leonora Speyer may capture the most mordant and bewildering humor of her time It is not negative wit and may not be completely conscious but it strips away all hoakum however sweet leaving our intent and passion like a shell crusted with salt There are traces of this trenchancy in her verse  O bottled widow s woe Standing in ostentatious row Within the gloom Of dear departed s tomb Evaporated lover s grief  A Canopic Jar has unpretentious beauty and clear thought and no earmarks of vulgar success or sacrosanct largeness She seems able to endure the inward conflict and sedentary work required even to commence art And one may be sure that she will not rest upon the achievement of this book or repeat it in her second betraying those who have faith in her Already her Magdalene ballad in a recent issue of the Nation is a finer episodic lyric than any in this book She is able to create passages of such intransient beauty as this   New Fire  Does the heart grieve on After its grief is gone Like a slow ship moving Across its own oblivion  Who shall say that her fire in the rushes which gives so  fair a light may not come to burn gold  Glenway Wescott  PAGEANTRY AND RHETORIC  Rip Van Winkle by Percy Mackaye Alfred A Knopf Two Mothers Eight Hundred Rubles and Agrippina by  John G Neihardt Macmillan Co  The talent of Percy Mackaye lies in the field of pageantry and it is no mean talent as he proved in his St Louis masque In pageantry the picture must speak louder than words and Mr Mackaye unquestionably speaks louder with pictures than with words For years he has been laboring to find his medium through poetry The sensibilities of an artist and a laudable ambition have led him to fake poetry but his words fail to augment or enhance his pictures Until he practically discards the use of words he will not be a free artist  Rip Van Winkle has pageant values rather than poetic Written as light opera it is patterned in the usual manner dialogues lyrics comedy dance It lacks the snap of light opera but its pictures and ensembles are distinctly valuable as sublimated extravaganza and poetically effective as pageant material The author has a vision for pictorial symbolism in broad compositions filling large   canvases for extravagant effects to be put across great distances and to register in the conglomerate comprehension of fifteen thousand people  The story of Rip Van Winkle is a tradition It is material for a drama if the protagonist Rip lighthearted humorous pathetic tragic is sincerely and profoundly characterized Playing drinking dreaming the outcast we want it all to the bitter end not a sugarcoated substitute Mr Mackaye s more palatable arrangement of the story lacks the original tang His tampering with the legend is like changing the theme of a play which has made the play Washington Irving Thomas Jefferson Tony Sarg s puppets all retain the old flavor Mr Mackaye s version is flat lacks the old richness  In the beginning of Act III Rip for the first time takes the characterization familiar to us a fantastic figure without locale Later in the act he assumes the dialect of a New England farmer and at the close he is suddenly transformed by the magic flask into a romantic youth  Something of a fakir and something of an artist Mr Mackaye paints living pictures on an enormous canvas in a public park  Eight Hundred Rubles by John G Neihardt is a tragic episode compact in scenario but unbalanced in its development The long speeches the digressions and the song at the beginning of the episode hamper the progression at the start They do not to any extent promote suspense   Pageantry and Rhetoric  nor establish the exposition In so short a play the exposition must be precipitated into the drama immediately Without premonition the tragedy is revealed and the play is over before we know it has begun The verse lacks ease and the flow of line into line it jolts over a corduroy road  In Agrippina he again indulges in long speeches and they in turn indulge themselves to the point of licentiousness in rhetorical luxury The licentiousness of Nero pales by comparison and the delayed story grows dull  The stories of these two plays seem far removed as does the verse but it is possible that Mr Neihardt s spirit lives and breathes and has its being in the far removed All a poet can do and all that one can demand of a poet is to react honestly The sincerity of Mr Neihardt is generally acknowledged but Bacchus cannot be revived by filling his cup with grape juice  Laura Sherry  THE NOVELIST AS POET  As the Wind Blows by Eden Philpotts Macmillan Co  Not a few novelists try their hand at poetry Apparently it seems to them somehow the fitting thing to do Commonly they write poetry which shows taste and literary craftsmanship rather than emotional impulse  Mr Philpotts book is of this kind It manifests skill in the handling of rhyme and conventional rhythms It has the sense of fitness which has characterized the   English literary tradition for generations It has also the poetic vocabulary and attitude which have been a part of the same tradition For example  For June must joy though joy departs And life must laugh though sorrow smarts And buds must break as well as hearts  Most of the author s work of course is better than this though still lacking in intensity and originality of expression His lighter verse such as Gaffer s Song and Scandal possesses humor and charm As would be expected in the work of a novelist however the narrative poems carry most entertainingly the rather boyish naiveté of subject and style Tiger for example or The Fruit of the Tree which solemnly offers the suggestion that if ape or sloth had eaten of the Tree of Knowledge it might have ruled the kingdoms of the world with kinder wit than man In Tiger there is a good deal of spirit and vividness suggested by the rattling rhythm of the opening lines  To the barking of the monkeys to the shrieking of the birds To the bellow of the bison and stampeding of the herds At fiery edge of sunset from the jungle to the wold Death stalks in shining ebony and orange tawny gold  N A C  THE PROFESSOR AS CRITIC  The Function of the Poet and Other Essays by James Russell Lowell Houghton Mifflin Co The Kinds of Poetry and Other Essays by John Erskine Duffield amp Co   The Professor as Critic  James Russell Lowell during his Harvard period was the leading professor of English literature in the United States John Erskine now professor of English in Columbia has a distinguished position in academic circles of the present day The earliest essay in the Lowell volume was originally published in 1845 the latest in 1894 The earliest paper in Dr Erskine s book first appeared in 1912 the most recent in 1920 The two books therefore afford opportunity to compare academic critical opinion of two quite distinct periods  Few persons nowadays read Lowell s criticism The preface to the present volume contributed by Albert Mordell admits that some of Lowell s literary opinions are old fashioned to us though the learned commentator characteristically claims that Lowell before Freud understood the psychoanalytic theory of genius in its connection with childhood memories Whether or not Lowell realized the influence of childish repressions it is certain that he is old fashioned He speaks a language that we of today are not quite at home in and are not interested enough to learn His classifications his reduction of criticism to scientific laws his rhetorical style belong to the journalism of an earlier day We shall not again attire our thought in this sort of raiment any more than we shall wear the kind of clothes that Mr Lowell wore  This does not mean that Lowell s critical work was valueless It was not He contributed to American criticism a degree of scholarship and fairness and except   when puzzled by the intrusion of a man of genius like Poe he welcomed sometimes very cordially the new writer He did much to turn criticism away from the personal blind alleys into which it had previously been so often led He is a figure of interest in the history of criticism but we do not turn to him for guidance today  Dr Erskine s book belongs to its own time as much as Dr Lowell s The difference is that Dr Erskine s day is ours His four essays make an interesting book with a flavor of sly humor now and then which adds a zest toits solid value I think the universities should require every student who expects to teach English literature to read it not because it is the best book on poetry of the present day but because it is the best on the subject for the sort of person who usually teaches literature But the publishers will probably not get out an extra edition on the prospect of orders from the universities They doubtless know that Lowell s book is more likely to get the academic orders than is Erskine s Dr Erskine has the quality never forgiven by the true academician of not being interested in what everybody else has forgotten  The Erskine book is also suggestive for the poet especially the closing essay Scholarship and Poetry in which the author shows the value to the poet of an unpedantic literary background The essay on The New Poetry is hospitable to the new but contains little material which the ordinary student of the movement does not already know I must however quote one delicious sentence   The Professor as Critic  Many of the new poems do look at first a bit outrageous especially to old fashioned readers who have not read widely in old fashioned literature  Lowell was in tune with his time and Erskine is with his It is unfortunate that much academic criticism of today is living in Lowell s time instead of Erskine s  Nelson Antrim Crawford  NOTES  Mr Wallace Stevens of Hartford Conn has appeared often in POETRY since 1914 Two years ago his Pecksniffiana received the Levinson Prize Mr Stevens has been a frequent and valued contributor to the special
