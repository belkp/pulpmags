ether You would become electrons out of whirling Would rise to atoms then as an atom resting Till through Yourself in other atoms moving  And by the fine affinity of power Atom with atom massed You would go on Over the crest of visible forms transformed Would be a molecule a little system Wherein the atoms move like suns and planets With satellites electrons So as worlds build From star dust as electron to electron The same attraction drawing molecules Would wed and pass over the crest again Of visible forms lying content as crystals Or colloids ready now to use the gleam   Of life As it were I see You with a match As one in darkness lights a candle and one Sees not his friend s form in the shadowed room Until the candle s lighted even his form Is darkened by the new made light he stands So near it Well I add to all I ve asked Whether You knew the cell born through the glint Of that same lighted match could never rest Even as electrons rest not but would surge Over the crest of visible forms become Beneath our feet life hidden from the eye However aided as above our heads Over the Milky Way great systems whirl Beyond the telescope become bacilli Amoeba star fish swimming things on land The serpent and then birds and beasts of prey The tiger You in the tiger on and on Surging above the crest of visible forms Until the ape came oh what ages they are But still creation flies on wings of light Then to the man who roamed the frozen fields Neither man nor ape we found his jaw You know At Heidelberg in a sand pit On and on Till Babylon was builded and arose Jerusalem and Memphis Athens Rome Venice and Florence Paris London Berlin New York Chicago did You know I ask All this would come of You in ether moving   The Conversation  A Voice  I knew  Man  You knew that man was born to be destroyed That as an atom perfect whole at ease Drawn to some other atom is broken changed And rises over the crest of visible things To something else that man must pass as well Through equal transformation And You knew The unutterable things of man s life from the first You saw his racked Deucalion soul that looks Backward on life that rises where he rose Out of the stones You saw him looking forward Over the purple mists that hide the gulf Ere the green cell rose even in the green cell You saw the sequences of thought You saw That one would say All s matter and another All s mind and man s mind which reflects the image Could not envision it that even worship Of what You are would be confused by cries From India or Palestine that love Which sees itself beginning in the seeds That fly to seek and wed each other maims The soul at the last in loss of child or friend Father or mother And You knew that sex Ranging from plants through beasts and up to us Had ties of filth and out of them would rise   Diverse philosophies to tear the world You knew when the green cell arose that even The You which formed it moving on would bring Races and breeds madmen tyrants slaves The idiot child the murderer the insane All springing from the action of one law You knew the enmity that lies between The lives of micro beings and our own You knew How man would rise to vision of himself Immortal only in the race s life And past the atom and the first glint of life Saw him with soul enraptured yet o ershadowed Amid self consciousness  A Voice  I knew But this your fault you see Me as apart Over removed at enmity with you You are in Me and of Me even at one With Me But there s your soul your soul may be The germinal cell of vaster evolution Why try to tell you If I gave a cell Voice to inquire and it should ask you this After me what a stalk a flower life That swims or crawls And if I gave to you Wisdom to say You shall become a reed By the water s edge how could the cell foresee What the reed is bending beneath the wind   The Conversation  When the lake ripples and the skies are blue  As larkspur Therefore I who moved in darkness Becoming light in suns and light in souls  And mind with thought for what is thought but light Sprung from the clash of ether I am with you  And if beyond this stable state that stands For your life here as cells are whole and balanced  Till the inner urge bring union then a breaking  And building up to higher life there is No memory of this world nor of your thought Nor sense of life on this world lived and borne Or whether you remember know yourself  As one who lived here suffered here aspired  What does it matter You cannot be lost As I am lost not Therefore be at peace  And from the laws whose orbits cross and run  To seeming tangles find the law through which  Your soul shall be perfected till it draw  As the green cell the sunlight draws and turns Its chemical effulgence into life My inner splendor All the rest is mine In infinite time For if I should unroll  The parchment of the future it were vain  You could not read it   ARABEL  Twists of smoke rise from the limpness of jeweled fingers The softness of Persian rugs hushes the room Under a dragon lamp with a shade the color of coral Sit the readers of poems one by one And all the room is in shadow except for the blur Of mahogany surface and tapers against the wall  And a youth reads a poem of love forever and ever Is his soul the soul of the loved one a woman sings Of the nine months which go to the birth of a soul And after a time under the lamp a man Begins to read a letter having no poem to read And the words of the letter flash and die like a fuse Dampened by rain it s a dying mind that writes What Byron did for the Greeks against the Turks And a sickness enters our hearts the jeweled hands Clutch at the arms of the chairs about the room One hears the parting of lips and a nervous shifting Of feet and arms  And I look up and over The reader s shoulder and see the name of the writer What is it I see the name of a man I knew You are an ironical trickster Time to bring After so many years and into a place like this This face before me hair slicked down and parted In the middle and cheeks stuck out with fatness   Arabel  Plump from Camembert and Clicquot eyelids Thin as skins of onions cut like dough round the eyes Such was your look in a photograph I saw In a silver frame on a woman s dresser and such Your look in life you thing of flesh alone  And then As a soul looks down on the body it leaves A body by fever slain I look on myself As I was a decade ago while the letter is read  I enter a box Of a theatre with Jim my friend of fifty I being twenty two Two women are in the box One of an age for Jim and one of an age for me And mine is dressed in a dainty gown of dimity And she fans herself with a fan of silver spangles Till a subtle odor of delicate powder or of herself Enters my blood and I stare at her snowy neck And the glossy brownness of her hair until She feels my stare and turns half view and I see How like a Greek s is her nose with just a little Aquiline touch and I catch the flash of an eye And the glint of a smile on the richness of her lips  The company now discourses upon the letter But my dream goes on  I re live a rapture Which may be madness and no man understands Until he feels it no more The youth that was I   From the theatre under the city s lights follows the girl Desperate lest in the city s curious chances He never sees her again And boldly he speaks And she and the older woman her sister Smile and speak in turn and Jim who stands While I break the ice comes up and so Arm in arm we go to the restaurant I in heaven walking with Arabel And Jim with her older sister We drive them home under a summer moon And while I explain to Arabel my boldness And crave her pardon for it Jim the devil Laughs apart with her sister while I wonder What Jim the devil is laughing at No matter To morrow I walk in the park with Arabel  Just now the reader of the letter Tells of the writer s swift descent From wealth to want  We are in the park next afternoon by the water I look at her white throat full as it were of song And her rounded virginal bosom beautiful And I study her eyes I search to the depths her eyes In the light of the sun They are full of little rays Like the edge of a fleur de lys and she smiles At first when I fling my soul at her feet   Arabel  But when I repeat I love her love her only A cloud of wonder passes over her face She veils her eyes The color comes to her cheeks And when she picks some clover blossoms and tears them Her hand is trembling And when I tell her again I love her love her only she blots her eyes With a handkerchief to hide a tear that starts And she says to me You do not know me at all How can you love me You never saw me before Last night Well tell me about yourself And after a time she tells me the story About her father who ran away from her mother And how she hated her father and how she grieved When her mother died and how a good grandmother Helped her and helps her now and how her sister Divorced her husband And then she paused a moment I am not strong you d have to guard me gently And that takes money dear as well as love Two years ago I was very ill and since then I am not strong  Well I can work I said And what would you think of a little cottage Not too far out with a yard and hosts of roses And a vine on the porch and a little garden And a dining room where the sun comes in When a morning breeze blows over your brow And you sit across the table and serve me   And neither of us can speak for happiness Without our voices breaking or lips trembling  She is looking down with little frowns on her brow But if ever I had to work I could not do it I am not really strong  But I can work I said I rise and lift her up holding her hand She slips her arm through mine and presses it What a good man you are she said just like a brother I almost love you I believe I love you  The reader of the letter being a doctor Is talking learnedly of the writer s case Which has the classical marks of paresis  Next day I look up Jim and rhapsodize About a cottage with roses and a garden And a dining room where the sun comes in And Arabel across the table Jim is smoking And flicking the ashes but never says a word Till I have finished Then in a quiet voice Arabel s sister says that Arabel s straight But she isn t my boy she s just like Arabel s sister She knew you had the madness for Arabel That s why we laughed and stood apart as we talked And I ll tell you now I didn t go home that night I shook you at the corner and went back   Arabel  And stayed that night Now be a man my boy Go have your fling with Arabel but drop The cottage and the roses  They are still discussing the madman s letter  And memory permeates me like a subtle drug The memory of my love for Arabel The torture the doubt the fear the restless longing The sleepless nights the pity for all her sorrows The speculation about her and her sister And what her illness was  And whether the man I saw one time was leaving Her door or the next door to it and if her door Whether he saw my Arabel or her sister   The reader of the letter is telling how the writer Left his wife chasing the lure of women  And it all comes back to me as clear as a vision The night I sat with Arabel strong but conquered Whatever I did I loved her whatever she was Madness or love the terrible struggle must end She took my hand and said You must see my room We stood in the door way together and on her dresser Was a silver frame with the photograph of a man  I had seen him in life hair slicked down and parted In the middle and cheeks stuck out with fatness   Plump from Camembert and Clicquot eye lids Thin as skins of onions cut like dough round the eyes There is his picture she said ask me whatever you will Take me as mistress or wife it is yours to decide But take me as mistress and grow like the picture before you Take me as wife and be the good man you can be Choose me as mistress how can I do less for you dearest Or make me your wife fate makes me your mistress or  wife I can leave you I said You can leave me she echoed But how about hate in your heart  You are right I replied  The company is now discussing the subject of love They seem to know little about it  But my wife who is sitting beside me exclaims Well what is this jangle of madness and weakness What has it to do with poetry tell me  Well it s life Arabel There s the story of Hamlet for instance I added Then fell into silence  Edgar Lee Masters   NOVEMBER IN THE PARK  The lamps hang low in the silent park A hundred milk white moons The trees weep gently in the dark In dim festoons The trees reach outward upward Long dark arms In tearful dancing and in prayer The small pond bares to drifting skies The furtive charms Of her silver eyes And lies where white paths gleam around Like something rare For Beauty and Romance have drowned A princess there  Dorothy Dudley   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SONGS FOR A VIOLIN  I  Blown gold was the hair of the child In the wind and the sun by the sea And the sea was silver and jade And pearl where the breakers played Like children strange and wild In a pagan ecstasy And the child cried out to his mother Oh let me play in the sea But I heard the voice of the mother Weary with waiting long Hush my child come near to me The sea is cruel and strong  II  I groped through blooms in the dark And a fragrance stirred to me And I knew that I touched a rose Although I could not see  So for your soul I would grope In the dark if you were dead As I knew the rose I would know Your soul and be comforted   Songs for a Violin  III  It seems sometimes that I have been Upon an island far at sea Shipwrecked alone and I have seen  White sails beyond the call of me Have seen them pass to what fair skies Beyond the hunger of my eyes  IV  The dead may know How can we say So when the tomb is over me You who in life could never give The things that with the dead may live Come all alone and silently Give unto me at close of day A red rose for your lips I pressed So oft in dreams and bending low Give me a lily for your breast The dead may know  Glenn Ward Dresbach   REFUGEES  Belgium 1914  Mother the poplars cross the moon The road runs on so white and far We shall not reach the city soon Oh tell me where we are  Have patience patience little son And we shall find the way again God show me the untraveled one God give me rest from men   Mother you did not tell me why You hurried so to come away I saw big soldiers riding by I should have liked to stay  Hush little man and I will sing Just like a soldier if I can They have a song for everything Listen my little man  This is the soldiers marching song We ll play this is the village street Yes but this road is very long And stones have hurt my feet   Refugees  Nay little pilgrim up with you And yonder field shall be the town I ll show you how the soldiers do Who travel up and down  They march and sing and march again Not minding all the stones and dust They go God grant me re6t from men Forward because they must  Mother I want to go to sleep No darling Here is bread to eat O God if thou couldst let me weep Or heal my broken feet  THE LITTLE ROSE IS DUST MY DEAR  The little rose is dust my dear The elfin wind is gone That sang a song of silver words And cooled our hearts with dawn  And what is left to hope my dear Or what is left to say The rose the little wind and you Have gone so far away  Grace Hazard Conkling   WAR  There was a time When there was no war Deep I look into that pool of memory  And see the things I thought of then the dreams I dreamed Like strange corals at the bottom of the sea Each for being so far so lost Shining with a beauty past its own They lie like jewels that have slipped into the ocean Unattainable and gone A moment of great sweetness a day of great beauty a dream  a longing a happy chance  Never shall I touch them again Never I believe shall I see their like again In the dark horror of these days  Catherine Wells   CHARCOALS  A MAN TO A DEAD WOMAN  A child half sleepily piecing together bits of paper I draw close the remnants of my mind And when they are quite together the lack of you blows  them apart My spirit curving as a pliant burdened tree Sitting with your spirit and plaiting the shadows of its hair Does not see the child and his labors  I do not know whether to be joy white with my spirit Or rent gray with the blown remnants of my mind  THE CRUCIFIXION  Her body was flowing and close woven A slippery whispering curtain which could not stop Streams of dim gleams behind it One day with a long knife I cut a rent in the curtain I saw a soul nailed to a cross Slender perfect lipped trying to laugh at its agony Counting its spattering blood drops amusedly And somehow I could not find the sight dreadful   THOUGHTS WHILE WALKING  A steel hush freezes the trees It is my mind stretched to stiff lace And draped on high wide thoughts  My soul is a large sapless park And people walk on it as they do on the park before me They numb my levelness with dumb feet Yet I cannot even hate them  STREETS  Rows of exact streaked faces Each afraid to be unlike the other Recalling the rows of people I have bowed to O bare yellow houses let me batter different shapes into you With cracked knuckles Glass globes on signs and in shops with a light not their own Recalling the small souls that festoon the streets of my  remembrance Oh let me place you between large thumbs And break you to showers of falling splinters and sparks   The Steam Shovel  THE STEAM SHOVEL  There was an unsightly arm And a cupped hand with three crusted fingers The hand sank into earth and bulged with it Then swung aloft in sudden exaltation And the seamy blotched man beside me said I ve stood here for two hours watching that steam shovel Can t seem to get enough of it  I stood for hours but I did not see the shovel I saw the man in smirched blue Jerking a rope at the precise moment When the laden hand dipped over a freight car His strained wet face and his eyes pressed to specks I saw the knotted up man at the engine His face dead and dented like old tin Life to him is the opening and closing of levers And heavy sleep  When I walked away the two men were fixed paintings In the little art gallery of my mind Where portraits are weighed well before admitted The steam shovel I had forgotten it  Maxwell Bodenheim   ALONE  Ah never in all my life Have I ever fled away From the loneliness that follows My spirit night and day  Though I fly to the dearest face It follows without rest To the kind heart of love And the beloved breast  Though I walk amid the crowd Still I walk apart Alone alone I lie Even at the loved one s heart  SONG AT NIGHT  Under your window deep in the heart of the night Something is crying under the starry sky Between the going night and the growing light It is I it is I  Under your window cries without quiet or rest Something that cries with the hurrying winds that cry For the You that sleeps deep in the heart of your breast It is I it is I   Beethoven  BEETHOVEN  Behold the tormented and the fallen angel Wandering disconsolate the world along That seeks to atone with inconsolable anguish For some old grievance some remembered wrong To storm heaven s iron gates with angry longing And beat back homeward in a shower of song  John Hall Wheelock   THE HOUSEMOTHER  They cling to the skirts of my spirit with their tiny imperious clutch With bonds of my love they enmesh me woven close by their satin soft touch Not an hour of their clamorous waking they spare me the whole day through Till the weight on my wings is an anguish and I faint for the fetterless blue Then washed by the wild wind of freedom that sweeps from the heavenly steep I swoop from the violet spaces to hover and bless them asleep  I bring him his wheat bread and honey I run for his sandals and staff Though the day may have drained me at evening I must still be his goblet to quaff Dear despot of love little recks he of vigils untamed that I keep I the server who rise from my pillow to watch him fulfilled and asleep Then I toss back the hair of my spirit bare my feet for the heavenly streams And range with him lover and lover hand in hand through the world of his dreams  Karle Wilson Baker   THE CHARWOMAN  She was grown old in misery and want Her threads of life heckled by sordid need Stretched taut by lack of love and woven plain And then by pain and fear worn very thin One would not look for prettiness and grace In such a fabric  Yet this charwoman Dun and bedraggled though she surely seemed By a brave miracle of God s good love Is rich and sweet and lovely in my eyes  Because I met the morning with a smile Because I gave a pleasant kindly word Which was small gift out of my happiness For this with utmost gracious courtesy She touched her lips one morning to my hand And my heart leaped in me to follow her  BIRTH  This was the blessing of his draught of power And this the sudden ripple of her hope And the swift current of their great desire The eddying wonder of their silent hours   The rising floodtide of her agony The billowing beauty of the Infinite Borne in a miracle upon the shallows Of their small individual human lives  Yet is it but a little human babe Given at last into his reaching arms And carried to the hollow of her breast  Marguerite Wilkinson  NOVEMBER SUN  Rain softened mellow Sunshine of waning November Dapples the apple leaves russet and amber and yellow Don t you remember Trailing behind him Jocund red fungus heads why does he hide in December Where we can t find him Changed to a frost crimsoned orange faced sleep headed  fellow Blizzards behind him  J C Chadivick   SUNDAY MORNING  I Complacencies of the peignoir and late Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair And the green freedom of a cockatoo Upon a rug mingle to dissipate The holy hush of ancient sacrifice She dreams a little and she feels the dark Encroachment of that old catastrophe As a calm darkens among water lights The pungent oranges and bright green wings Seem things in some procession of the dead Winding across wide water without sound The day is like wide water without sound Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet Over the seas to silent Palestine Dominion of the blood and sepulcher  II She hears upon that water without sound A voice that cries The tomb in Palestine Is not the porch of spirits lingering It is the grave of Jesus where he lay We live in an old chaos of the sun Or old dependency of day and night Or island solitude unsponsored free Of that wide water inescapable Deer walk upon our mountains and the quail   Whistle about us their spontaneous cries Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness And in the isolation of the sky At evening casual flocks of pigeons make Ambiguous undulations as they sink Downward to darkness on extended wings  III  She says I am content when wakened birds Before they fly test the reality Of misty fields by their sweet questionings But when the birds are gone and their warm fields Return no more where then is paradise There is not any haunt of prophecy Nor any old chimera of the grave Neither the golden underground nor isle Melodious where spirits gat them home Nor visionary South nor cloudy palm Remote on heaven s hill that has endured As April s green endures or will endure Like her remembrance of awakened birds Or her desire for June and evening tipped By the consummation of the swallow s wings  IV  She says But in contentment I still feel The need of some imperishable bliss Death is the mother of beauty hence from her Alone shall come fulfilment to our dreams   Sunday Morning  And our desires Although she strews the leaves Of sure obliteration on our paths The path sick sorrow took the many paths Where triumph rang its brassy phrase or love Whispered a little out of tenderness She makes the willow shiver in the sun For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze Upon the grass relinquished to their feet She causes boys to bring sweet smelling pears And plums in ponderous piles The maidens taste And stray impassioned in the littering leaves  V Supple and turbulent a ring of men Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn Their boisterous devotion to the sun Not as a god but as a god might be Naked among them like a savage source Their chant shall be a chant of paradise Out of their blood returning to the sky And in their chant shall enter voice by voice The windy lake wherein their lord delights The trees like seraphim and echoing hills That choir among themselves long afterward They shall know well the heavenly fellowship Of men that perish and of summer morn And whence they came and whither they shall go The dew upon their feet shall manifest  Wallace Stevens   EDITORIAL COMMENT  A NATION WIDE ART  DURING my recent travels through our scenic  West I was moved to wonder what would  be the ultimate effect upon our art and liter  ature of those great heights and depths and  spaces those clear skies and living waters those colors incredible and magnificent For in spite of a few pioneers we have not yet taken possession of our inheritance entered into our kingdom  Mark Twain was the greatest of our continental adventurers of course His Life on the Mississippi is an epic of the great river which puts it on the map of art even as the Iliad placed Troy there and Don Quixote Spain With this book American literature crossed the Mississippi But although its author and Bret Harte and Mary Austin and other writers of tales John Muir and other essayists and to a far less degree a few poets have given us episodic glimpses into the vast region beyond revealed something of its drama and poetry and mystery they have as yet but skirted the edges of the new domain  But some day American poets will become aware of all this magnificence of nature as English poets have been aware of the sea and their art will be inspired to a new richness a new spaciousness Of course the long eastward gazing of our artists their obstinate residence in the Atlantic states their more obstinate preoccupation with the arts and liter   A Nation wide Art  atures of feudal Europe all this cannot last much longer They will be forced out of their corners their prejudices by those hardy pioneers steel rails journalism moving pictures popular tales and songs local festivals world s fairs clamorous cities At last they will have to follow the people obey the people s need of them They will have to go west leaving Europe and even New Europe behind And in that day our art our literature will cease to be provincial will resume the continental habit which began with Whitman and Mark Twain  Who can measure for example the future spiritual influence of the Grand Canon of Arizona the architectonic effect of its beauty of structural line and subtly harmonized color Years ago I wrote in the Atlantic for December 1899  It is as though to the glory of nature were added the glory of art as though to achieve her utmost the proud young world had commanded architecture to build for her and color to grace the building The irregular masses of mountains cast up out of the molten earth in some primeval war of elements bear no relation to these prodigious symmetrical edifices mounted on abysmal terraces and harmoniously grouped to give form to one s dreams of heaven The sweetness of green does not last forever but these mightily varied purples are eternal All that grows and moves must perish while these silent immensities endure Lovely and majestic beyond the cunning of human thought the mighty monuments rise to the sun as lightly as clouds that pass And forever glorious and forever immutable they must rebuke man s pride with the vision of ultimate beauty and fulfil earth s dream of rest after her work is done  That journey took me across the strange desert in a stage  coach and ended in a log shack at Grand View This year   my sleeper brought me to sumptuous El Tovar and Grand View sixteen miles away has been bought by Mr William Randolph Hearst doubtless for presentation to the people of the United States Yet I was not content with the modern comforts no longer was the Canon mine alone the world whom I had invited was there by the carload the trainful the million Surely it was right it must be but my democracy was not equal to the strain Oh for a cave at Navajo Point where never a tourist disturbs the solitude where only ten years ago I watched a thunderstorm stalk up and down the abyss spreading a gray curtain behind the Temple of Vishnu that rose on purple terraces prodigious and sublime  If the Canon is not of this world if it is at one hour of the day or mood of the sky a terraced Inferno of still fires at another the crumbling capital of a dead planet at another the New Jerusalem peopled by spirits of the blest in the Yellowstone in the Yosemite we have this world in full joy the old earth quickening her paces and singing for the dance Nowhere else is she so alive in the Yellowstone with fountains in the Yosemite with cataracts In the Yellowstone the prodigious variety of boiling waters shames the imagination Out of the hot dark earth they come in pinprick bubbles that sputter and spit in little fairy fountains that spread their gauze over the rocks in great geysers that spurt slowly out of their holes and then spring skyward on sparkling wings and finally in the Giant grandest of all which darts up straight and tall as a sequoia and plumes the   A Nation wide Art  blue heavens with steam And there are pools of every most brilliant hue often shaped and dyed like flowers hot blooms with stems to the hidden deeps of the earth And at last for a climax the great Gorge spread with color like the palette of God sloping down vividly to the bright green river which foams into crystal far below  The Yosemite was out of my range this year but who that has once possessed its cliffs and cataracts can lose them The valley means for me gleaming walls and domes of white granite with great waters falling slenderly at every cleft and the vast park above means flowery valleys between ranged white peaks it means long tramps beside foaming rivers nights under the pines days of mountain trails over rocks and snow One day climbing out of the valley I stopped for two hours under Upper Yosemite Fall listening to its shout of triumph as it plunged sixteen hundred feet over the cliff It was like a young Greek god poised white and tall against the rock summoning snow spirits from the heights to fill the air with wings  Each of the falls has its own character Bridal Veil is a wraith whose scarf of lace the wind spreads wide Illillouette is a dancer with foamy feet free as air Nevada is a princess white fingered leaping into the sturdy arms of Vernal who shouts as he carries her to his cave  But if I talked of Lac Léman and the Matterhorn more of my readers would follow me Some day all this glory will belong to all the world Who will be its interpreters to the world our poets and artists or our journalists photograph   ers movies Centuries ago the Egyptian desert inspired its people with an art so expressive that we still cherish it who will meet the challenge of Arizona a desert more varied more richly painted and cut to its granite heart with canons What poet will dare drink his nectar from the glacier and seek out Alaska smiling her brief summer smile between icebergs  When we make these things our own in spirit and truth our art will cross the seass and our poems be on all men s tongues H M  A POET S DECLARATION OF RIGHTS  We have each a right to four lives No one has the right to more or less than that  The first life we have a right to is the life of work Thankless grinding that is what it comes to It is cramming an engine each day with its fuel so that it may go on grinding out something that is convertible into more fuel for its strength  The second life we have a right to is the life of thought How many steps in advance and hurried retreats to the rear must we have before we can attain to this life How few really care to attain to it at all For thought brings not peace but a sword  Our third right is the life of feeling and experience Are we afraid of this life Then let us turn from the arms that   A Poet s Declaration of Rights  cradled us and the breasts we sucked for without feeling and experience life is a void of living death  Our fourth right is the life of creation Out of all these other lives it springs and it is greater than them all for it looks beyond them  We have each the right to these four lives These are our rights and we must fight for them for none are easy to attain Yet no one has any right to more or less than these  Only when we have attained them all can we become complete men and women And when we have attained them for all men and women we shall be neither socialists nor supermen but human beings knowing and understanding humanity John Gould Fletcher  REVIEWS  JAPANESE POETRY  The Spirit of Japanese Poetry by Yone Noguchi E P  Dutton amp Co Japanese Lyrics translated by Lafcadio Hearn Houghton Mifflin Co Japanese poetry because of its brevity is sometimes con  sidered ephemeral and slight even trivial like those little Japanese gardens which the westerner appreciates as a toy but whose deeper significance as a small mirror or reflection of nature is concealed from him  Japanese poetry is never explanatory its method is wholly suggestive yet in its power to evoke associations or to appeal   to the imagination it is profound rather than trivial Brevity is occasioned by intensity Nor is the effect of the Japanese hokku at all similar to that of the epigram as commonly conceived which like the serpent with its tail in its mouth is a closed circle As Mr Noguchi says  Although my understanding of that word epigram is not necessarily limited to the thought of pointed saying I may not be much mistaken to compare the word with a still almost dead pond where thought or fancy nay the water hardly changes or procreates itself The real hokkus are a running living water of poetry where you can reflect yourself to find your own identification  In this little book Mr Noguchi gives us many unintentional examples of the hokku in his way of expressing his thought there is no dead phrasing This in itself is a hokku in spirit  A great hokku poem never makes us notice its limitation of form but rather impresses us by the freedom through mystery of its chosen language as if a sea crossing wind blown in from a little window  To appreciate Japanese poetry we must identify ourselves as much as possible with the vision of the Japanese poet and artist the two arts are more intimately connected in the Japanese mind than with us The ancient sages said that a poem is a painting without visual shape and a painting is poetry put into form To understand the deeper significance of Japanese poetry indeed we must go back to its foundations in the body of art and poetry produced during the Sung dynasty in China under the influence of Zen Buddhism this gentle Zen doctrine which holds man and nature to be two parallel sets of characteristic forms between which   Japanese Poetry  perfect sympathy prevails W e can then understand why although we speak of Japanese poetry as suggestive the word is not used as in connection with certain French symbolist poets to denote vagueness  Th e following passage from Ernest Fenollosa s Epochs of Chinese and Japanese Art gives us more than a glimpse into the mind of the Zen poet  That such a doctrine The Zen should become a powerful adjunct of poetry is due to its keen perception of anal ogies All real poetry is just this underground perception of organic relation between things which custom classifies as dif ferent This principle lies at the very root of the enlargement of vocabulary in primitive languages Nature was so plastic and transparent to the eye of early man that what we call metaphor flashed upon him as a spiritual identity to be embodied at once in language in poetry and in myth Zen only tried to get back to that primitive éclaircissement A word like a thing means as much as you can see into it and therefore lights up with a thousand chameleon like shadings which of later days only the poet knows how to use with a hint of the original color So in Chinese poetry every character has at least two shades of meaning its natural and it s spiritual or the image and its metaphorical range In Chinese poetry we find extreme condensation for every word is packed with thought Hence also the parallelism goes on to couplets or stanzas contrasted in their apparent yet unlike in their real meanings  It is clear too that such a doctrine must have a still more powerful influence over art When Sung went to nature with Zen it practically declared for landscape painting a form that before had been used in art only sporadically Sung and Tang are par excellence the epochs of landscape art not only for China but for the world No such apotheosis of landscape has ever been vouchsafed to the west Even in landscape poetry we ought to notice the lateness as well as the thinness of the stream that began to flow with Wordsworth The Wordsworth of China lived more than a thousand years ago and the idealistic intimations to which the English bard somewhat timidly gave aPLATONIC form only hinted at instead of unfolding a system   The sounding cataract haunted him like a passion but what did it say to him In our landscape art we were long satisfied with pretty backgrounds for saints and even in Dutch landscape it was rather the peaceful suburbs of cities or the rustic life of farms that greets us not the free forms of nature in its violence and creative motion The truth is that all through the Middle Ages the dualistic view of nature wild nature was essentially evil the horror of grand rocks and lonely valleys the hostility of matter to the heaven directed human spirit delayed the European perception of beauty in mountains and storms until the nineteenth century  I do not know enough of the Japanese language to realize how much of the music or rhythm of the original may be lost in translation Mr Noguchi says When our Japanese poetry is best it is let me say a searchlight or flash of thought or passion cast on a moment of life and nature which by virtue of its intensity leads us to the conception of the whole it is swift discontinuous an isolated piece Andfeel sure that the vivid sense of the originals is conveyed extremely well in many of the translations given by Mr Noguchi and Lafcadio Hearn Both translators are intelligent enough not to mar the effect of the original by attempting to recast it in rhyme and metre It is interesting sometimes to see how the two men have translated the same poem This for instance is a popular song of which the first version is Hearn s and the second Noguchi s  Things never changed since the time of the gods The flowing of water the way of love  What does never change Since the days of the gods Is the way how a river runs What does never change   Japanese Poetry  Since the days of the gods  Is the way how love flows  The two following hokkus which I cannot forbear quoting for the sake of the vivid pleasure they convey recall Mallarmé s direction To be instituted a relation between images exact and that therefrom should detach itself a third aspect fusible and clear offered to the divination  When I saw the fallen flower return to the branch lo it was only a butterfly  The second is a lament of a mother for her child  The hunter of dragon flies  To day how far away  May he have gone  If the ideal of Japanese poetry through its more intimate connection with the visual image may have tended towards concentration and brevity our western poetry may have tended towards verbosity through its greater dependence upon vocal rhythm its greater inter relation with music with sound The roots of the matter go back to the genesis of the two languages one phonetic and the other ideographic which it is impossible to do more than mention here Mr Noguchi in explaining the nature of Japanese poetry perforce contrasts it with English poetry and his remarks are sometimes illuminating  I come always to the conclusion that the English poets waste too much energy in words words words and make doubtless with all good intentions their inner meaning frustrate at least less distinguished simply from the reason that its full liberty to appear naked is denied My Japanese opinion shaped by heredity impulse and education was terribly shattered quite many years ago when Edwin Markham s The Man with a Hoe   made a furore in the American press I exclaimed What You say it is poetry How is it possible It appeared to me to be a cry from the socialist platform rather than a poem I hope I do not offend the author if I say that it was the American journalist whose mind of curiosity always turns to use a Japanese expression to making billows rise from the ground Before Edwin Markham there was Whittier who sent out editorial volleys under the guise of poetry it is not too much to say I dare think that An American Anthology by Mr Sted man would look certainly better if it were reduced to one hundred pages from its eight hundred we are bewildered to see so many poet journalists perfectly jammed in the pages One cannot act contrary to education we are more or less the creation of tradition and circumstance It was the strength of the old Western poets particularly Americans that they preached theorized and moralized besides singing in their own days but when I see that our Japanese poetry was never troubled by Buddhism or Confucianism as such I am glad here to venture that the Western poet would be better off by departing from Christianity social reform and what not   I deem it one of the literary fortunes a happy happening but not an achievement that till quite recently our Japanese poetry was never annoyed fatigued tormented by criticism What I am thankful for is that it has never degenerated into mere literature when the Western poetry is in the hand so to say of men of letters the greatest danger will be found in the fact that they are often the prey of publication it is true that the Western poets minor or major or what not have had always the thought of printing from early date till today I have seen so many poets who only live between the covers and die when the ink fades away  I have quoted these passages because I think the impression made upon the mind of a Japanese by our poetry assists us in forming our own conception of Japanese poetry  Considering the importance of the oriental influence upon all western art of the last half century an influence that is only now curiously enough beginning to make itself felt in   Japanese Poetry  our literature it is highly necessary that our conception of Japanese and Chinese poetry should be based upon a wider knowledge of originals In a sense this widening of artistic boundaries is only a part of that general internationalizing of thought which many people hope will be however indirectly the one truly lasting victory of the European conflict We need not venture to say what English poetry may gain from a possible infusion of oriental influence It has gained much in the past from many derivative sources all of which have contributed their share of richness and beauty to English verse It is a mistake to judge poetry even English poetry as one critic recently insisted only by English standards of comparison We have yet to realize as Ernest Fenellosa says how much the alien is at the root of the national Here in America influences pour in upon us from both sides We may yet become the melting pot of the arts as well as of races  For the student of comparative poetry Yone Noguchi s little book will serve as a key to a vast store house of treasure The Japanese lyrics translated by Lafcadio Hearn and reprinted conveniently in a single volume have been selected from his many essays on the subject So much is lost however of the fine flavor of Hearn s personal scholarship that I think certain selections from the essays themselves should have been retained or at least that a reference list of the essays from which the poems were taken should have been given A C H   MASEFIELD ON SYNGE  John M Synge a Few Personal Recollections with Biographical Notes by John Masefield Limited Edition Macmillan  John Synge was and is one of those ideal and romantic figures about whom controversy does not flourish but on whom the imagination loves to linger There was no paradox in Synge no inconsistency to puzzle or illuminate He was an artist an artist with none of that admixture of the man of the world which is not uncommon among artists who are also men of letters and none of the priest or the prophet or the pedagogue a character too simple to explain Mr Masefield who was perhaps as close an intimate as Synge had in his later years is one to sympathize with Synge s pleasure in all that is wild in life and shares with his subject that love of phrases which is so like the artist s love of line and so opposite to the mob s satisfaction in catchwords It is a rare thing in our day if not in any day to find a voluntary vagabond and a genuine craftsman in the same person Mr Masefield feels it is a fine thing especially when the man is not interested in politics or religion or indeed in ideas of any sort but only in life He records that Synge s talk was all about men and women and what they did and what they said when life excited them and on the same page calls him the perfect companion He emphasizes the fact that Synge was a spectator and a listener seldom a par   Masefield on Synge  ticipant or a talker Is it not curious that the favorite author of such a man should have been Racine  By far the greater part of Synge s work is in the form of plays But what these could possibly owe to Racine is a mystery They are the work of a man with a deep vein of irony a malicious insight into life but above everything else they are the work of a poet Riders to the Sea is a poem and for the matter of that so is The Playboy of the Western  World  But Mr Masefield remarks that the few short poems reveal the Synge he knew more directly than the plays By this I think he means that the poems are the most intimate personal confession that this singularly quiet man ever made They are indeed personal They give us little touches of his life as he lived it in Paris hoarding his sack of coals or in Wicklow walking the roads or in the Arran Islands fiddling for a dance And they give too that most poignant epitaph prepared for a day that Synge knew to be not far distant  With Fifteen ninety or Sixteen sixteen We end Cervantes Marot Nashe or Green Then Sixteen thirteen till two score and nine Is Crashaw s niche that honey lipped divine And so when all my little work is done They ll say I came in Eighteen seventy one And died in Dublin What year will they write For my poor passage to the stall of Night  The poems have too that love of the flavor of all that is wild the austere phrasing and the restraint characteristic of the man and of the plays Lucian Cary   IN MEMORIAM  Since our last number went to press death has hushed the voice of Remy de Gourmont the distinguished French poet and man of letters who contributed two brief poems Je n aime plus and La Vasque and an article on French Poets and the War to POETRY last January  M de Gourmont dying at fifty seven is best known as a prose writer of curious enigmatical and beautiful works but he has published a small volume of verse Divertissements and remarkable experiments in prose poetry like Les Litanies de la Rose quoted with admiration in our pages  As a critic of literature morals institutions and life he is perhaps most eminent every intellectual person is bound to read sooner or later his L Idéalisme La Culture des Idées Le Latin Mystique Le Livre des Masques and other works of penetrating intelligence Add to these his numerous novels short stories plays translations from old French Spanish and Latin and his poetry and you have evidence of one of the most catholic minds of his time one whose motto is best expressed in his own words Ne laissons pas mourir la tradition des libres esprits  A more recent lamentable death is that of a young American poet Alan Seeger a member of the Foreign Legion who was killed in the trenches A year or more ago he volunteered because Paris was in peril the old haunts were desolate the boon companions gone it was unthinkable to leave the danger to them and accept only the pleasures oneself   In Memoriam  Seeger s article in the New Republic of May 22nd from which the above sentence is quoted seemed to me at the time the best brief presentation of a modern idealist s plea for war which I had ever read Profoundly mistaken as I think it mediaeval guff a Chicago lawyer called it with precise exactness yet this time honored belief in the sublimity of war is sanctified by so many young lives as many heroic deaths that the world struck to the heart hesitates too long to give it up and recognize war as a brutal and insane debauchery  The death of this young poet in his neighbor s quarrel is one more heroic sacrifice to Moloch one more note of beauty in the glamour H M  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  AUTUMN LEAVES FROM ENGLAND  Little serial leaflets are an adventure of poets in war ridden England today We advise our readers to subscribe for all of them they cost but a few pennies apiece or two or three shillings for a series now and some day a few at least may be precious first editions And the art in England needs fostering if it is not to be crushed under the heels of war  We have for example the Poets Translation Series reprints from The Egoist of translations of the less familiar Greek and Latin poetry and prose literature which has too long been the property of pedagogues its human qualities   obscured by the wranglings of grammarians who love it principally because it is so safe and dead  But to poets it is not dead but more alive more essential than anything we can find in contemporary English literature And the new translations will be done by poets whose interest in their authors will be neither conventional nor frigid and who will take no concern with glosses notes or any of the apparatus with which learning smothers beauty  The first number has just reached us Mr Aldington s translation of the surviving poems all from the Anthology of Anyte of Tegea whom Antipater of Thessalonika called the woman Homer The translator s fitness for his labor of love can hardly be challenged and the beauty of his texts is indicated by these two poems  A SOLDIER The earth of Lydia holds Amyntor Philip s son he gained many things in iron battle No sickness led him to the house of night he died holding his round shield before his friend  THE HE GOAT Watch the horned he goat of Bromios how proud are the fierce eyes in his shaggy head He is proud because as they go together over the hills Nais holds in her hand a lock of hair on his cheek  For the other numbers Edward Storer has translated most of the fragments old and new of Sappho H D choruses from the Rhesos of Euripides Richard Aldington certain Latin poems of the Italian Renaissance James Whitall the poems of Leonidas of Tarentum and F S Flint the   Autumn Leaves from England  Mosella of Ausonius And all six numbers may be had postpaid by sending fifty cents to the London Egoist  Another set of six leaflets which began in October is announced by D H Lawrence as a small fortnightly journal called The Signature the subscription for the six being three shillings or seventy five cents to be sent to 12 Fisher Street Southampton Row London W C Mr Lawrence writes Will you take it and get one or two friends to take it not for the money s sake but for the spirit which is struggling in it And he adds How is poetry going in America There is none in England the muse has gone like the swallows in winter This is the real winter of the spirit in England we are just preparing to come to fast grips with the war  A third set of leaflets is Loose Leaves in which Edward Storer issues his verse and prose from time to time No I is a series of delicate prose poems The Country Walk No II is a brief suggestive essay on The Case of the Modern Artist which we may return to later and No III is Helen the one act play or rather dramatic essay in poetic prose which was first printed in Poetry and Drama Helen bears perhaps the same relation to drama which posturing bears to the dance in it Paris Helen and Menelaus pass slowly statelily across the stage uttering the rich speech of a modern poet who has thought out their destiny for them  The first series of eight numbers may be had for seventy five cents from the author at 12 Harper Street London  W C   ANNOUNCEMENT OF AWARDS  Once a year it becomes the agreeable duty of the editors and Advisory Committee of POETRY to award one or more prizes This year we shall have the pleasure of awarding three In addition to the Levinson prize of two hundred dollars two guarantors who wish to be nameless have requested us to honor two other poets of our third year with prizes of one hundred and of fifty dollars The Levinson prize must go to a citizen of the United States but the two other prizes are offered without such restriction  The jury feels that there is a certain presumption in offering and awarding a prize for the best poem since no jury can pass final judgment and that it will be in better taste and perhaps in the end more truthful to omit the word best from our offers and awards in the future The prizes will continue to be given naturally for the poems or groups of poems which seem to the jury the most worthy of the honor but we shall not assume to rob Father Time of his prerogative by deciding which are the best Our prizes are awarded in the same spirit which art juries aim at in making the numerous and munificent awards at the annual exhibitions in our large cities they express the admiration of fellow artists for work of superior quality but they do not express infallible or irrevocable judgment  In this spirit then we award the three prizes so generously offered for the encouragement of the art Works of members of the jury are ineligible including this year Old   Announcement of Awards  Songs for New by Alice Corbin Mrs Henderson Poems by Miss Edith Wyatt Poe ns by Mr Ezra Pound and Mountain Poems by Miss Monroe Other exemptions are Miss Amy Lowell withdraws her poems from the prize competition Metal Checks by Miss Louise Driscoll has been judged ineligible because it received the war poem prize Mr Carl Sandburg may not again compete for the Levinson prize because he received it last year and death has removed from competition poems by Rupert Brooke Madison Cawein and Remy de Gourmont  The HELEN HAIRE LEVINSON PRIZE of two hundred dollars offered by Mr Salmon O Levinson of Chicago for a poem or group of poems by a citizen of the United States published by POETRY during its third year October 1914 to September 1915 is awarded to  MR VACHEL LINDSAY of Springfield Illinois for his poem The Chinese Nightingale published in the February number The prize of one hundred dollars offered by a guarantor for a poem or group of poems published by POETRY during its third year is awarded to MISS CONSTANCE LINDSAY SKINNER of New York for her group of poems Songs of the Coast dwellers published in October 1914 The prize of fifty dollars similarly offered by a guarantor is awarded to H D MRS RICHARD ALDINGTON   of London England for her Poems published in the March number  Besides the above prize winners the jury desires to mention with special honor Nineteen fourteen by Rupert Brooke the three war sonnets published in the April number just before the young poet s death And the following poems also are given honorable mention  The Syrian Lover in Exile Remembers Thee Light of My  Land by Ajan Syrian June Silence by Edgar Lee Masters February The Love song of J Alfred Prufrock by T S Eliot  June Polonius and the Ballad Singers by Padraic Colum July The New

Genevieve by Dorothy Dud  ley June The Temple by Lee Wilson Dodd January Phases by Wallace Stevens November Rain at Night by Helen Hoyt August   Announcement of Awards  Annie Shore and Johnnie Doon by Patrick Orr January A Statue in a Garden by Agnes Lee October Harp of the Wind by Frances Shaw July Sub Terra by William Carlos Williams May Post Annos by James Branch Cabell August  The HELEN HAIRE LEVINSON PRIZE of two hundred dollars will be continued under the same conditions as before for POETRY S fourth year also the prize of one hundred dollars offered anonymously by a guarantor In addition to these Mrs Julius Rosenwald has offered a prize of one hundred dollars the conditions of which will be announced next month  Last month we announced a prize of one hundred dollars donated by the Players Producing Company of Chicago for a one act play in metrical verse or vers libre the play to be American in subject or substance and to be actable  Decision is to be made by the staff of POETRY and the donor who reserve the right to withhold the prize if no suitable plays come in The prize winner will be published in the magazine and the Players Producing Company will have the acting rights customary royalties being given  Plays must be received at this office before Feb 1 1916 The manuscript must not be signed but a sealed envelope must accompany it containing the title the name of the author and a stamped self addressed envelope for return  We continue to urge the permanent endowment of prizes and scholarships in this art corresponding to such endowments in the other arts Poetry is the worst paid of all the   arts and no Fund or Foundation or University or American Academy in Rome or other institution offers scholarships or foreign travel or anything else to young poets As yet POETRY S prizes and two of fifty dollars offered for the best lyrics by our local contemporary The Trimmed Lamp are the only ones in sight May they breed competitors  H M for the Jury
