like flowers undone For the first time now for the first time seen  ALL OF ROSES  I  By the Isar in the twilight We were wandering and singing By the Isar in the evening We climbed the huntsman s ladder and sat swinging In the fir tree overlooking the marshes While river met with river and the ringing Of their pale green glacier water filled the evening   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  By the Isar in the twilight We found our warm wild roses Hanging red at the river and simmering Frogs were singing and over the river closes Was scent of roses and glimmering In the twilight our kisses across the roses Met and her face and my face were roses  IIWhen she rises in the morning I linger to watch her She stands in silhouette against the window And the sunbeams catch her Glistening white on the shoulders  While down her sides the mellow Golden shadow glows and her breasts Swing like full blown yellow Gloire de Dijon roses  She drips herself with water And her shoulders Glisten as silver they crumple up Like wet and shaken roses and I listen For the rustling of their white unfolding petals  In the window full of sunlight She stirs her golden shadow And flashes all herself as sun bright As if roses fought with roses   III Just a few of the roses we gathered from the Isar Are fallen and their mauve red petals on the cloth Float like boats on a river waiting For a fairy wind to wake them from their sloth  She laughs at me across the table saying She loves me and I blow a little boat Rocking down the shoals between the tea cups And so kiss beladen that it scarce can float  IV  Now like a rose come tip toe out of bud I see the woman s soul steal in her eyes And wide in ecstasy I sit and watch The unknown flower issued magic wise  And day by day out of the envious bud My treasure softly slips uncurled And day by day my happiness vibrates In wide and wider circles round the world  FIREFLIES IN THE CORN  A woman taunts her lover  Look at the little darlings in the corn The rye is taller than you who think yourself So high and mighty look how its heads are borne   POETRY A Magazine of V erse  Dark and proud on the sky like a number of knights Passing with spears and pennants and manly scorn  And always likely Oh if I could ride With my head held high serene against the sky Do you think I d have a creature like you at my side With your gloom and your doubt that you love me  O darling rye How I adore you for your simple pride  And those bright fireflies wafting in between And over the swaying cornstalks just above All their dark feathered helmets like little green Stars come low and wandering here for love Of this dark earth and wandering all serene  How I adore you you happy things you dears Riding the air and carrying all the time Your little lanterns behind you it cheers My heart to see you settling and trying to climb The corn stalks tipping with fire their spears  All over the corn s dim motion against the blue Dark sky of night the wandering glitter the swarm Of questing brilliant things you joy you true Spirit of careless joy ah how I warm My poor and perished soul at the joy of you   Poems  The man answers and she mocks  You re a fool woman I love you and you know I do Lord take his love away it makes him whine And I give you everything that you want me to Lord dear Lord do you think he ever can shiner  A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND  Ah stern cold man How can you lie so relentless hard While I wash you with weeping water Ah face carved hard and cold You have been like this on your guard Against me since death began  You masquerader How can you shame to act this part Of unswerving indifference to me It is not you why disguise yourself Against me to break my heart You evader  You ve a warm mouth A good warm mouth always sooner to soften Even than your sudden eyes Ah cruel to keep your mouth Relentless however often I kiss it in drouth   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  You are not he Who are you lying in his place on the bed And rigid and indifferent to me His mouth though he laughed or sulked Was always warm and red And good to me  And his eyes could see The white moon hang like a breast revealed By the slipping shawl of stars Could see the small stars tremble As the heart beneath did wield Systole diastole  And he showed it me So when he made his love to me And his brows like rocks on the sea jut out And his eyes were deep like the sea With shadow and he looked at me Till I sank in him like the sea Awfully  Oh he was multiform Which then was he among the manifold The gay the sorrowful the seer I have loved a rich race of men in one But not this this never warm Metal cold   Poems  Ah masquerader With your steel face white enamelled Were you he after all and I never Saw you or felt you in kissing Yet sometimes my heart was trammelled With fear evader  Then was it you After all this cold hard man Ah no look up at me Tell me it isn t true That you re only frightening me  You will not stir Nor hear me not a sound Then it was you And all this time you were Like this when I lived with you  It is not true I am frightened I am frightened of you And of everything 0 God God too Has deceived me in everything In everything   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE WIND THE RASCAL  The wind the rascal knocked at my door and I said  My love is come But oh wind what a knave thou art To make sport of me when the days of my heart  Are drearisome And wearisome  THE MOTHER OF SONS  This is the last of all then this is the last I must fold my hands and turn my face to the fire And watch my dead days fusing into dross Shape after shape and scene after scene from the past Sinking to one dead mass in the dying fire Leaving the grey ash cold and heavy with loss  Strange he is to me my son whom I waited like a lover Strange as a captive held in a foreign country haunting The shore and gazing out on the level sea White and gaunt with wistful eyes that hover Always upon the distance as his soul were chaunting The dreary weird of departure away from me  Like a young bird blown from out of the frozen seas Like a bird from the far north blown with a broken wing Into our sooty garden he drags and beats   Poems  From place to place perpetually and seeks release From me and the hound of my love that creeps up fawning For his mastership while he in displeasure retreats  1 must look away from him for my fading eyes Like a cringing dog at his heels offend him now Like a toothless hound pursuing him with my eyes Till he chafes at my cringing persistence and a sharp  spark flies Into my soul from the sudden fall of his brow And he bites his lip in pain as he hears my sighs  This is my last it will not be any more All my life I have borne the burden of myself All the long years of sitting in my husband s house And never have I said to myself as he closed the door Now I am caught you are hopelessly lost O self You are frightened with joy my heart like a frightened  mouse  Three times have I offered my soul three times re  jected It will not be any more no more my son my son Never to know the glad freedom of obedience since long  ago The angel of childhood kissed me and went I expected A man would take me and now my son 0 my son I must sit awhile and wait and never know A bridegroom till twixt me and the bright sun   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Death in whose service is nothing of gladness takes me For the lips and the eyes of God are behind a veil And the thought of the lipless voice of the Father shakes  me With fear and fills my eyes with tears of desire But the voice of my life is dumb and of no avail And the hands in my lap grow cold as the night draws  nigher  ILLICIT  In front of the sombre mountains a faint lost ribbon of  rainbow And between us and it the thunder And down below in the green wheat the laborers Stand like dark stumps still in the green wheat  You are near to me and your naked feet in their sandals And through the scent of the balcony s naked timber I distinguish the scent of your hair so now the limber Lightning falls from heaven  Adown the pale green glacier river floats A dark boat through the gloom and whither The thunder roars But still we have each other The naked lightnings in the heavens dither And disappear What have we but each other The boat has gone   Poems  BIRTHDAY  If I were well to do I would put roses on roses and cover your grave With multitude of white roses and just a few  Red ones a bloody white flag over you  So people passing under The ash trees of the valley road should raise Their eyes to your bright place and then in wonder  Should climb the hill and put the flowers asunder  And seeing it is your birthday They would say seeing each mouth of white rose praise You highly every blood red rose display  Your triumph of anguish above you they would say  Tis strange we never knew While she was here and walking in our ways That she was as the wine jar whence we drew  Our draught of faith that sent us on anew  And so I d raise A rose bush unto you in all their hearts A rose of memory with a scent of praise  Wafting like solace down their length of days  D H Lawrence   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A DAY FOR WANDERING  I set apart a day for wandering I heard the woodlands ring The hidden white throat sing And the harmonic West Beyond a far hill crest Touch its Aeolian string Remote from all the brawl and bruit of men The iron tongue of Trade I followed the clear calling of a wren Deep to the bosom of a sheltered glade Where interwoven branches spread a shade Of soft cool beryl like the evening seas Unruffled by the breeze And there and there I watched the maiden hair The pale blue iris grass The water spider in its pause and pass Upon a pool that like a mirror was I took for confidant The diligent ant Threading the clover and the sorrel aisles For me were all the smiles Of the sequestered blossoms there abloom Chalice and crown and plume I drank the ripe rich attars blurred and blent And won Content  Clinton Scollard   HEART S HOLIDAY  Without a city s whirling dust A city s alley wall Without a bleak pale strip of sky Within high festival  Without no greeting between friends From the hurrying crowd no smile Within mv heart s slow pageant moves In glorious solemn file  There was no call for revel Day Who summons us each morn Came forth in dreariest garb and blew No gala herald horn  But slave of day I am not nay Her mistress still I wield The crystal sceptre of my mood Bearing my dream s white shield  Exultant rapture flooded mad With mystic inner mirth My heart holds her strange carnival Unseen of all the earth   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  IOLÉ  I long for white lilies White roses and rest White raiment and silence Like a dove s white breast  Thy faun came too near me Well loved I the dance My garland he blighted With his ribald glance  Thy faun danced too wildly His wreath was awry His pipe was discordant Too harsh was his cry  I long for white raiment My garland so gay I ve plucked at in horror And flung far away  I long for white lilies I ask to be still Oh silence his singing Come cover and kill   OH HUSH MY HEART  Oh hush my heart while I recall The rosy footed years When I had no heart at all Only quick smiles and tears Oh sweet it was and safe it was And oh I would I were Still running with white dreams that pass Like clouds across the air  Oh hush my heart while I recall The silent sandaled days When I had no heart at all Only my soul s white ways Oh sweet it was and very strange To find a white soul so Oh would that I again might range Heartless her fields of snow  Oh would I had no heart at all For oh the stormy hour When my hot heart rose to a call Bearing a crimson flower Alas my soul s wide wanderings My limitless desire Now all my dreams have heavy wings And hover round a fire   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Now all my world is made of hands That cling to mine again And I am bound with iron bands Of passion and of pain  ALLEGRA AGONISTES  A gleam of gold in gloom and gray A call from out a fairer day Oh pang at heart and ebbing blood Hush bread and salt should be thy mood Stern woman of the Brotherhood  Clamor of golden tones and tunes Hint of faint horns breath of bassoons They wound my soul again I lie Face earthward in fresh agony Oh give me joy before I die  World world I could have danced for thee And I had tales and minstrelsy Kept fairer I had been more good Hush bread and salt should be thy mood Soul of the breadless Brotherhood  Some thou hast formed to play thy part The bold the cold the hard of heart   Poems  Thy rue upon my lips I toss Rose was my right 0 world the loss When Greek limbs writhe upon the cross  Grace Fallow Norton  TO A FRIEND  As a child parts the petals of a rose Seeking perplexed within the perfumed core A tangible sweetness so my thoughts explore This twilit hour through many a fragrant close Our interfolded years Proud Memory shows Old visions of far days bright in her store Beside the light last speech we loitered o er So thornless fair our Rose of Friendship blows But whence the subtle sweetness which makes rare Slight common joys so they be shared by you Or why that distant hour each spirit chose Instant the other Sense may not lay bare The mystery of love I thus pursue As a child parts the petals of a rose  Minor Watson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE ROSE I remember a day when I stood on the sea shore at Nice holding a scarlet rose in my hands The calm sea caressed by the sun was brightly garmented in blue veiled in gold and violet verging on silver Gently the waves lapped the shore and scattering into pearls emeralds and opals hastened towards my feet with a monotonous rhythmical sound like the prolonged note of a single harp string High in the clear blue golden sky hung the great burning disc of the sun White sea gulls hovered above the waves now barely touching them with their snow white breasts now rising anew into the heights like butterflies over the green meadows Far in the east a ship trailing its smoke glided slowly from sight as though it had foundered in the waste I threw the rose into the sea and watched it caught in the wave receding red on the snow white foam paler on the emerald wave And the sea continued to return it to me again and again at last no longer a flower but strewn petals on restless water So with the heart and with all proud things In the end nothing remains but a handful of petals of what was once a proud flower John Cournos after K Tetmaier   Poems  POEMS  I I have drifted along this river Until I moored my boat By these crossed trunks  Here the mist moves Over fragile leaves and rushes Colorless waters and brown fading hills  You have come from beneath the trees And move within the mist A floating leaf  O blue flower of the evening You have touched my face With your leaves of silver  Love me for I must depart  II LESBIA  Grow weary if you will let me be sad Use no more speech now Let the silence spread gold hair above us Fold on delicate fold Use no more speech You had the ivory of my life to carve   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And Picus of Mirandola is dead And all the gods they dreamed and fabled of Hermes and Thoth and Bel are rotten now Rotten and dank  And through it all 1 see your pale Greek face Tenderness Makes me eager as a little child to love you You morsel left half cold on Caesar s plate  III ARGYRIA O you O you most fair Swayer of reeds whisperer Among the flowering rushes You have hidden away your hands Beneath the poplar leaves You have given them to the white waters  Swallow fleet Sea child cold from the waves Slight reed that sang so blithely in the wind White cloud the white sun kissed into the air Pan mourns for you  White limbs white song Pan mourns for you   Poems  IV THE POPLAR  Why do you always stand there shivering Between the white stream and the road  The people pass through the dust On bicycles in carts in motor cars The waggoners go by at dawn The lovers walk on the grass path at night  Stir from your roots walk poplar You are more beautiful than they are  I know that the white wind loves you Is always kissing you and turning up The white lining of your green petticoat The sky darts through you like blue rain And the grey rain drips on your flanks And loves you And I have seen the moon Slip his silver penny into your pocket As you straightened your hair And the white mist curling and hesitating Like a bashful lover about your knees  I know you poplar I have watched you since I was ten   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But if you had a little real love A little strength You would leave your nonchalant idle lovers And go walking down the white road Behind the waggoners  There are beautiful beeches Down beyond the hill Will you always stand there shivering  v GLAUCOPIS O maidens whom I loved And now love not at all  Nor even the memory of your shadowy faces Who loved me also Striving with delicate and sensuous days To thrall my soul Behold From the hush and the dusk Come like the whisper of dawn Her frail her magical feet From the desert she blossoms A flower of the winds Tremulous shaken by love  Ah Gods And I may not hearken Nor stoop to the flower Richard Aldington   EDITORIAL COMMENT  THE TRADITION  Penitus enim tibi O Phoebe atlributa est cantus  THE tradition is a beauty which we preserve  and not a set of fetters to bind us This  tradition did not begin in A D 1870 nor  in 1776 nor in 1632 nor in 1564 It did  not begin even with Chaucer The two great lyric traditions which most concern us are that of the Melic poets and that of Provence From the first arose practically all the poetry of the ancient world from the second practically all that of the modern Doubtless there existed before either of these traditions a Babylonian and a Hittite tradition whereof knowledge is for the most part lost We know that men worshipped Mithra with an arrangement of pure vowel sounds We know that men made verses in Egypt and in China we assume that they made them in Uruk There is a Japanese metric which I do not yet understand there is doubtless an agglutinative metric beyond my comprehension  As it happens the conditions of English and forces in the English tradition are traceable for the most part to the two traditions mentioned It is not intelligent to ignore the fact that both in Greece and in Provence the poetry attained its highest rhythmic and metrical brilliance at times when the arts of verse and music were   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  most closely knit together when each thing done by the poet had some definite musical urge or necessity bound up within it The Romans writing upon tablets did not match the cadences of those earlier makers who had composed to and for the Cythera and the Barbitos  As touching the parallel development of the twin arts in the modern world it may be noted that the Canzon of Provence became the canzone of Italy and that when Dante and his contemporaries began to compose philosophic treatises in verse the son or accompaniment went maying on its own account and in music became the sonata and from the date of that divorce poetry declined until such time as Baif and the Pléiade began to bring Greek and Latin and Italian renaissance fashions into France and to experiment in music and quantity  The Italians of that century had renewed the art they had written in Latin and some little even in Greek and had used the Hellenic meters DuBellay translated Navgherius into French and Spenser translated Du Bellay s adaptations into English and then as in Chaucer s time and times since then the English cribbed their technique from over the channel The Elizabethans made to music and they copied the experiments of Paris Thus as always one wave of one of these traditions has caught and overflowed an earlier wave receding The finest troubador had sung at the court of Coeur de Lion Chaucer had brought in the making of France and ended the Anglo Saxon alliterative fashions The   Editorial Comment  Canzon of Provence which had become the canzone and sonnet had become Minnesang it had become the ballade and it became many an Elizabethan form And at that age the next wave from Paris caught it a wave part Romance in the linguistic sense and part Latin But Provence is itself Latin in a way for when the quantities of syllables had been lost through the barbarian invasions rhyme had come in as courtly ornament The first fragment of Provençal poetry is Latin with a Provençal refrain  Dr Ker has put an end to much babble about folk song by showing us Summer is ycummen in written beneath the Latin words of the first known example of a canon  II  A return to origins invigorates because it is a return to nature and reason The man who returns to origins does so because he wishes to behave in the eternally sensible manner That is to say naturally reasonably intuitively He does not wish to do the right thing in the wrong place to hang an ox with trappings as Dante puts it He wishes not pedagogy but harmony the fitting thing  This is not the place for an extensive discussion of technical detail Of the uses and abuses of rhyme I would say nothing save that it is neither a necessity nor a taboo   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  As to quantity it is foolish to suppose that we are incapable of distinguishing a long vowel from a short one or that we are mentally debarred from ascertaining how many consonants intervene between one vowel and the next  As to the tradition of vers libre Jannaris in his study of the Melic poets comes to the conclusion that they composed to the feel of the thing to the cadence as have all good poets since He is not inclined to believe that they were much influenced by discussions held in Alexandria some centuries after their deaths  If the earnest upholder of conventional imbecility will turn at random to the works of Euripides or in particular to such passages as Hippolytus 1268 et Seq or to Alkestis 266 et seq or idem 455 et seq or to Phoenissae 1030 et circa or to almost any notable Greek chorus it is vaguely possible that the light of vers libre might spread some faint aurora upon his cerebral tissues  No one is so foolish as to suppose that a musician using four four time is compelled to use always four quarter notes in each bar or in seven eighths time to use seven eighth notes uniformly in each bar He may use one 1 2 one 1 4 and one 1 8 rest or any such combination as he may happen to choose or find fitting  To apply this musical truism to verse is to employ  vers libre  To say that such and such combinations of sound and tempo are not proper is as foolish as to say that a painter   Editorial Comment  should not use red in the upper left hand corners of his pictures The movement of poetry is limited only by the nature of syllables and of articulate sound and by the laws of music or melodic rhythm Space forbids a complete treatise on melody at this point and forbids equally a complete treatise on all the sorts of verse alliterative syllabic accentual and quantitative And such treatises as the latter are for the most part useless as no man can learn much of these things save by first hand untrammeled unprejudiced examination of the finest examples of all these sorts of verse of the finest strophes and of the finest rhyme schemes and by a profound study of the art and history of music  Neither is surface imitation of much avail for imitation is indeed of use only in so far as it connotes a closer observation or an attempt closely to study certain forces through their effects Ezra Pound  SOBRIETY AND EARNESTNESS  This society whose purpose is the encouragement of sobriety and earnestness in all the arts  Thus Mr Meredith Nicholson to the National Institute of Arts and Letters during its recent session in Chicago And thus in effect the National Institute to the artists of the United States  That is the trouble with institutions intended for the benefit of art and artists It is not their fault perhaps but merely inevitable in any such organization the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  membership being numerous must be composed chiefly not of exceptional high spirits in the arts but of sober and earnest workers These latter far outnumbering the former will necessarily protect and perpetuate their own kind by admitting without question the sober and earnest candidate and rejecting the adventurous and original one  For this conservatism the sober and earnest are hardly to be blamed They have no means of recognizing genius when it appears they honestly suspect original thought original style They lack the prophetic imagination to hear in advance the verdict of time which is merely the reiterated opinion of exceptional spirits Thus with all possible good will toward genius in the abstract and with much palaver of praise tor entombed genius they inevitably shut their door in the face of genius in the concrete embodied in an actual living young man or woman  Thus we can not too frequently remind these elders who sit in judgment that sobriety and earnestness are precisely the two attributes of mediocrity which need no institute to encourage them without such aid they win most of the prizes and sit at most of the banquets The original creative spirit is earnest no doubt but his is the earnestness of courage not that of sobriety It is the earnestness of fire which scorches and destroys and gives light not that of the fog which decently veils the sun If the torch bearer is not encouraged if he batters   Sobriety and Earnestness  his head against the blind wall of public apathy it becomes physically and psychologically impossible for him to keep his soul and his light alive For only when the creative impulse meets an equally strong impulse of sympathy is the highest achievement possible in any department of human effort  The strongest argument for the Institute s existence and for the congressional charter which gives it a certain aspect of official sanction is as one or two speakers suggested the scattered and unorganized condition of the arts in the United States In England and France the capital is the center and out of a discord of conflicting claims the verdict of London and Paris emerges recognizably and goes around the world Here there is no center and no person or group of recognized authority whose verdict crosses state lines and at least gives the dissenters something to raise a hue and cry about The well meaning but preoccupied barber s wife of the Middle West has nothing but the opinion of her neighbors to pin her faith upon or to hit with her bludgeon of common sense Probably her distraught condition is inevitable in a democracy and we shall have to await the slow development of her intellect but it is possible that she may be assisted by the imposing name and the belettered membership of the National Institute of Arts and Letters and its more special inner circle the American Academy  If she is to be thus assisted if these bodies have this excuse for being it is of course absurd that they should   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  draw the line of sex Either they exist for the benefit and development of American arts and letters or they do not If they do they are bound to admit to membership such American artists and men and women of letters as deserve the recognition regardless of race color sex or previous condition of servitude If they do not exist for such benefit and development they deserve neither a charter from Congress nor any other official or popular sanction In this case their purpose is not even the encouragement of sobriety and earnestness in all the arts but only in those creations of art which proceed from sober and earnest males H M  REVIEWS  The Little Book of Modern Verse American edited by  Jessie B Rittenhouse Houghton Mifflin Co  For a contemporaneous anthology this is far from up to date It includes deceased poets Richard Hovey William Vaughn Moody George Cabot Lodge Arthur Upson Trumbull Stickney also a number born in the fifties or earlier Messrs Woodberry Santayana Cheney Sherman Carman et al On the other hand it omits most of the younger men and women who have anything essential to say Messrs Pound Oppenheim Reed Ficke Stringer Leonard the Misses Widdemer Akins Wyatt Mrs Wilkinson and others being conspicuous by their absence Even when anyone of the more radical progressives is quoted as in the cases of Messrs   Reviews  Robinson and Lindsay and Mrs Evans Florence Wilkinson the poems selected usually represent their more academic moods  In fact if this anthology were complete evidence our living American poets would deserve the common reproach of having little or nothing to say in immediate relation to modern life and thought and of saying that little as a rule in a too self conscious early Victorian manner Also their morality would seem to be of a Puritan primness more appropriate in a young ladies boarding school than in a wind swept continental nation We have many love songs frequently graceful many landscape poems ditto much rhymed eloquence of advice or reflection whose tameness prose would reveal but few poems which remind us that the artist lives only to give himself away to the world and give his world away to coming ages  Our bards may be too timorous and conventional but they are not so home bound and hide bound as this A less conservative editor would have presented a better case for them The true modern American anthology in short has not yet been assembled Meantime this incomplete and heavily padded one contains Mr Robinson s Lincoln Mr Markham s Man With the Hoe Mr Lindsay s Eagle Forgotten Mr Schauffler s Scum o the Earth Miss Cather s Grandmither Mrs Evans Memorial  Tablet Mr Kilmer s Martin Miss Guiney s Kings and a few other things of inextinguishable fire H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Minions of the Moon The Republic two volumes of poetry by Madison Cawein Stewart amp Kidd Company Cincinnati In the reviewer s judgment the two best poems in  the first volume are Wasteland and The Old Home originally published in POETRY These have a genuine and homely sincerity that distinguishes them from the other more conventionally facile poems of the volume The Republic the first poem in the second book is a patriotic ode full of the usual high sounding meaningless abstractions touching earth only once in the fourth strophe manifestly imitative of the third strope of Moody s  Ode in Time of Hesitation  By the long leagues of cotton Texas rolls And Mississippi bolls By the wide seas of wheat The far Dakotas beat Against the barriers of the mountainland And by the miles of maize Nebraska lays Like a vast carpet in Her House of Nights and Days Where glittering in council meet The Spirits of the Cold and Heat With old Fertility whose heart they win By all the wealth replete Within our scan From Florida to where the snows begin Made manifest of Nature unto Man Behold The land is as a mighty scroll unrolled etc   Review  Streets by Douglas Goldring Max Goschen London  A Country Boy by Douglas Goldring Andrew Melrose  London  Mr Goldring exhibits a determined intention to por  tray contemporary subjects The portrayal is largely external objective consisting of graphic sketches of houses streets places and people He does it very well with a certain bare directness but after all one misses just that note of subjective feeling which furnishes the necessary bridge of sympathy In this sense Mr Gold ring s work comes dangerously near photography representing scenes with which we are indeed familiar but to which if anything more than casual importance is to be attached the personal vision must be added  All down Acacia Road there are small bow windows Jutting out neighborly heads in the street And in each sits framed a quiet old woman They watch the couples who pass or meet  This for instance one of the best stanzas in the book is more than photography but if the external eye is to dominate literature as it has dominated and destroyed drama what hope will there be for poetry The Poems of Paul Marten Mitchell Kennerley  Young as he was Paul Mariett did not die without record without achievement This small volume of posthumous poems reveals a mind that had to a large extent escaped the swaddling bands of imitation and convention There is an unmistakable note of sin   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  cerity and honest originality in his work There is structure and beauty not lacking in restraint and a stern quality as of iron in these poems The twilight of the nerves that pervasive note of modern poetry or of the poetry of the nineties has no place in this book Twilight is here but it is the twilight of a strong mind and a strong body not unakin in spirit though not in expression to the hard unblinking acceptance of the tragic side of life that we have recognized in Synge As Mr Walter Lippman says in his preface In Paul Mariett the tragic is always active sharp and colored it was not so much a regret over life as an insight into it Not all of the poems represent an equally high grade of achievement I should especially recommend Coming Home from the Play Exotic The Temple of Azzi Rep The House of Eric And A Wife in Every Port Crew Practice Lyric but the reader must make his own choice after all Some Letters of William Vaughn Moody edited with an  Introduction by Daniel Gregory Mason Houghton  Mifflin Co  It is a pity that the glamour of personal friendship should have permitted the publishing of these early letters of William Vaughn Moody These letters not without charm to those who are able to feel through them the renewed warmth of a magnetic personality yet reflect very little of the poet s literary maturity and can contribute little to the public appreciation of his genius   Reviews  In a larger group of letters representing the fuller development of the man they would have found their place William Vaughn Moody was a conscientious artist scrupulously exacting and reserved deliberately refusing to give anything but the best of himself to the public The most inspiriting phase of this volume is found in the letter to Mr Henry Miller protesting against a certain deterioration in the stage presentation of The Great Divide and in the note supplied by Mr Mason of the author s refusal for artistic reasons to allow the novelization of the successful play a refusal estimated modestly at a cost of from twenty five to fifty thousand dollars To how many American authors would not such a refusal seem quixotic and extreme Or how many English authors would have resisted the temptation It is by such an action that one may measure the strength of the man and refute the European belief in the complete commercialism of American letters A C H A WORD FRO   The following letter to the editor of POETRY explains  itself  When I got the very unexpected letter with the prize of 50 my first emotion was how much it would have meant to me even ten years ago and then I thought surely there must be some young American writer today to whom it would mean a great deal not only in practical help but in encouragement I want you therefore not to think that I am in any way ungrateful to you or in any way anxious to put myself into a different category to your other contributors because I send   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  back to you 40 I will keep 10 and with that I will get Mr Sturge Moore to make me a book plate and so shall have a permanent memory of your generous magazine I vacillated a good deal until I thought of this solution for it seemed to me so ungracious to refuse but if I had accepted I should have been bothered by the image of some unknown needy young man in a garret Yours sincerely  W B YEATS  In another letter Mr Yeats says  I want to make a suggestion which you need not follow in any way Why not give the 40 to Ezra Pound I suggest him to you because although I do not really like with my whole soul the metrical experiments he has made for you I think those experiments show a vigorous Imaginative mind He is certainly a creative personality of some sort though it is too soon yet to say of what sort His experiments are perhaps errors I am not certain but I would always sooner give the laurel to vigorous errors than to any orthodoxy not inspired  I would like to say however that I have liked other work in your magazines I remember finding one number particularly charming But I think one is always safest if one selects a personality Of course there may be other men equally creative but then you see I am in ignorance and that is precisely why I feel I can only suggest to you a little timidly not to put my judgment before yours but because I may help you out of a difficulty  The prize having been awarded to Mr Yeats the editor of POETRY accepts as final his suggestion as to the disposition of the portion of it which he returns And she does this with the more
