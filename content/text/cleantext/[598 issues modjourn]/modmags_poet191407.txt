room Give the engines room Louder faster The little band master Whips up the fluting Hurries up the tooting He thinks that he stands The reins in his hands In the fire chief s place In the night alarm chase The cymbals whang To be read or sung in a heavy buzzing bass as of fire engines pumping    POETRY A Magazine of Verse The kettle drums bang Clear the street Clear the street Clear the street boom boom In the evening gloom In the evening gloom Give the engines room Give the engines room Lest souls be trapped In a terrible tomb Shriller and The sparks and the pine brands higher Whirl on high From the black and reeking alleys To the wide red sky Hear the hot glass crashing Hear the stone steps hissing Coal black streams Down the gutters pour There are cries for help From a far fifth floor For a longer ladder Hear the fire chief call Listen to the music Of the firemen s ball Listen to the music Of the firemen s ball    Poems to Be Chanted  Tis the night of doom Heavy bass Say the ding dong doom bells Night of doom Say the ding dong doom bells Faster faster The red flames come Hum grum say the engines Hum grum grum Buzz buzz Says the crowd Shriller and higher see see Calls the

manner  of languorous The band master sways insinuating  music Changing the strain That the wild band plays With a red and royal  Intoxication A tangle of sounds And a syncopation Sweeping and bending From side to side Master of dreams With a peacock pride A lord of the delicate Flowers of delight He drives compunction Back through the night   Poems to Be Chanted  Dreams he s a soldier Plumed and spurred And valiant lads Arise at his word Flaying the sober Thoughts he hates Driving them back From the dream town gates How can the languorous Dancers know The red dreams come When the good dreams go Tis the night of love Call the silver joy bells Night of love Call the silver joy bells Honey and wine Honey and wine Sing low now violins Sing sing low Blow gently wood wind Mellow and slow Like midnight poppies The sweethearts bloom Their eyes flash power Their lips are dumb Faster and faster Their pulses come   POETRY A Magazine of Verse Though softer now The drum beats fall Honey and wine Honey and wine Tis the firemen s ball Tis the firemen s ball To be whispered I am slain Cries True Love There in the shadow And I die Cries True Love There laid low When the fire dreamsThe wise dreams go come Interrupting with heavy bass But his cry is drowned By the proud band master And now great gongs whang Sharper faster And kettle drums rattle And hide the shame With a swish and a swirk In dead Love s name Red and crimson And scarlet and rose Magical poppies The sweethearts bloom    Poems to Be Chanted  The scarlet stays When the rose flush goes And Love lies low In a marble tomb Ti s the night of doom Call the ding dong doom bells Night of doom Call the ding dong doom bells  Hark how the piccolos still make cheer Tis a moonlight night in the spring of the year In a high key

first Khandaka of the Mahavagga There Buddha thus addressed his disciples Everything O mendicants is burning With what fire is it burning I declare unto you it is burning with the fire of passion with the fire of anger with the fire of ignorance It is burning with the anxieties of birth decay and death grief lamentation suffering and despair A disciple becoming weary of all that divests himself of passion By absence of passion he is made free    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  To be intoned I once knew a teacher Who turned from desire Who said to the young men Wine is a fire Who said to the merchants Gold is a flame That sears and tortures If you play at the game I once knew a teacher Who turned from desire Who said to the soldiers Hate is a fire Who said to the statesmen Power is a flame That flays and blisters If you play at the game I once knew a teacher Who turned from desire Who said to the lordly Pride is a fire Who thus warned the revellers Life is a flame Be cold as the dew Would you win at the game With hearts like the stars With hearts like the stars   Poems to Be Chanted  So beware Very loud  So beware So beware of the fire Clear the streets boom boom Clear the streets boom boom Give the engines room Give the engines room Lest souls be trapped In a terrible tomb Says the swift white horse To the swift black horse There goes the alarm There goes the alarm  They are hitched they are off They are gone in a flash And they strain at the driver s iron arm Clangaranga clangaranga Clang clang clang Clang a ranga clangaranga Clang clang clang   Clang a ranga

another name lark or thrush or the like No jes Rachel Jane  I  In which a racing auto comes from the east  To be sung This is the order of the music of the morning  or read delicately to an First from the far east comes but a crooning improvised  tune  The crooning turns to a sunrise singing Hark to the calm horn balm horn psalm horn Hark to the faint horn quaint horn saint horn  To be sung or Hark to the pace horn chase horn race horn  speed And the holy veil of the dawn has gone Swiftly the brazen car comes on It burns in the East as the sunrise burns I see great flashes where the far trail

the wind mills taunting ringing Dodge the cyclones Count the milestones   Poems to Be Chanted On through the ranges the prairie dog tills Scooting past the cattle on the thousand hills Ho for the tear horn scare horn dare horn Ho for the gay horn bark horn bay horn Ho for Kansas land that restores us When houses choke us and great books bore us Sunrise Kansas harvester s Kansas A million men have found you before us Deliberately in a rolling bass II In which many autos pass westward I want live things in their pride to remain I will not kill one grasshopper vain Though he eats a hole in my shirt like a door I let him out give him one chance more Perhaps while he gnaws my hat in his whim Grasshopper lyrics occur to him in a deliberate manner I am a tramp by the long trail s border Given to squalor rags and disorder I nap and amble and yawn and look Write fool thoughts in my grubby book Recite to the children explore at my ease WOR K when I work beg when I please Give crank drawings

drunk horns going by Up round this apple earth they come Blasting the whispers of the morning dumb Cars in a plain realistic row And fair dreams fade when the raw horns blow On each snapping pennant A big black name The careering city Whence each car came  Like a train They tour from Memphis Atlanta Savannah  cal1er in a  station Tallahassee and Texarkana They tour from St Louis Columbus Manistee They tour from Peoria Davenport Kankakee Cars from Concord Niagara Boston Cars from Topeka Emporia and Austin Cars from Chicago Hannibal Cairo Cars from Alton Oswego Toledo Cars from Buffalo Kokomo

edge of the wheat ridge speaks to me I talk with the leaves of the mulberry tree And now I hear as I sit all alone In the dusk by another big Santa FÃ© stone The souls of the tall corn gathering round

Oregon Illinois  Hawk of the Rocks Yours is our cause today Watching your foes Here in our war array Young men we stand Wolves of the West at bay  Power power for war Comes from these trees divine Power from the boughs Boughs where the dew beads shine Power from the cones Yea from the breath of the pine   Poems to Be Chanted  Power to restore All that the white hand mars See the dead east Crushed with the iron cars Chimneys black Blinding the sun and stars  Hawk of the pines Hawk of the plain winds fleet You shall be king There in the iron street Factory and forge Trodden beneath your feet  There will proud trees Grow as they grow by streams There will proud thoughts Walk as in warrior dreams There will proud deeds Bloom as when battle gleams  Warriors of Art We will hold council there Hewing in stone Things to the trapper fair Painting the gray Veils that the spring moons wear   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  This our revenge This one tremendous change Making new towns Lit with a star fire strange Wild as the dawn Gilding the bison range  All the young men Chanting your cause that day Red men new made Out of the Saxon clay Strong and redeemed Bold in your war array  Power power for war Comes from these trees divine Power from the boughs Boughs where the dew beads shine Power from the cones Yea from the breath of the pine  Nicholas Vachel Lindsay   POEMS  FROM A CLUB WINDOW  Life as I see young old men fight With sails or rifles scheme or faith And witness oldish young men pass This section of your hour glass I doubt if War may not be right Your substance Peace your dawdling wraith  RODIN  Cold bronze he has made articulate More scorching in its eloquence than the flames That melted it to his will of fire Cold marble he has made compassionate Wisdom unfathomable which understands All pain all dread all hunger all desire Cold clay he has made animate Life that exclaims You are but babbling shells I life entire All these things he has done this god Not as a god by sure austere commands But by thinking seeing feeling believing By invincible patience and tireless hands With a back of scorn for the self deceiving   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  With faith s disdain for The Day s demands A Titan self made by his masterful mold Who has fused into copper the meaning of gold All the truth he could scan All his ardor innate Breathed his soul in each stone poured his heart in each  clod A man Who stands shoulder to shoulder with Fate  Out of bronze and marble and clay formless cold One man has given death the lie  STAR MAGIC  Though your beauty be a flower Of unimagined loveliness It cannot lure me tonight For I am all spirit  As in the billowy oleander Full bloomed Each blossom is all but lost In the next One flame in a glow Of green veined rhodonite   Poems  So is heaven a crystal magnificence Of stars Powdered lightly with blue  For this one night My spirit has turned honey moth And has made of the stars Its flowers  So all uncountable are the stars That heaven shimmers as a web Bursting with light From beyond A light exquisite Immeasurable  For this one night My spirit has dared and been caught In the web of the stars  Though your beauty were a net Of unimagined power It could not hold me tonight For I am all spirit  Richard Butler Glaenzer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SITTING BLIND BY THE SEA  Oh sing me a song of the sea my son  Oh sing me a song of the sea For my eyes they are blind and I peer in the dark But my man s heart leaps when the sea dogs bark Can thy young eyes follow the yelping pack Wild bounding streaks of yellow and black Do they track over meadows of seething foam And will they be fetching the white gulls home  Perhaps they ll retrieve one to me To me sitting blind by the sea  To me in my door by the sea sitting blind  To me sitting blind in my door Days be when a battle is raging afar And the tramp of the cavalry crossing the bar Comes nearer and clearer with many a gun So plain to my ears while I sit in the sun That I m sure there ll be many a rainbow at play In and out of the manes and the tails of the spray  As the chargers plunge down in the roar To me sitting blind in my door  To me sitting blind in the night by the sea  Sitting blind by the sea in the night Times be when she purrs a gray cat at my knee Oh the glow on the hearth and the mother and thee Twas a hitch in her rocker that memory kept   Sitting Blind by the Sea  And I d know when it eased that our wee laddie slept  The sea has it all to the creak in her chair And I peering blind see the glint in her hair And it floods my lone soul with delight Sitting dark in my door in the night  To me sitting dark by the sea in my door To me by the sea sitting blind Rare times comes a silence as still as a cave And I know tis His night when He walks on the wave And strong in the faith with my feet on the land My soul speeds beside Him I d strive for His hand T o lay on my eyes but ah ever before I reach Him He s gone and I back in my door All alone by a whiff of the wind In my door by the sea sitting blind  Still it s sing me a song of the sea my son Oh sing me a song of the sea  And sorrow s slow leaven I ll nurse nevermore  For the soul of the sea signals mine on the shore  Deep calling to deep high answering high  Till my bosom seems gemmed with the stars of the sky  And when the moon nestles a pearl on my vest I feel her white soul come again to my breast And with this lad the mother and thee Are we lonely or blind by the sea  Ruth McEnery Stuart   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ROUMANIAN POEMS  WE WANT LAND  Hungry and naked and without a home am I My shoulders you have charged them with loads And you spit at me and you have beaten me And I have been to you a dog Wandering landowner brought by the wind If you have an understanding with Hell That we shall be dogs to you beat us more We will endure loads so will we endure want Bridle of horses yoke of cattle  But we want land  A piece of corn bread left from yesterday If you see it in our home you take it away Away you take our boys to the war And our girls you take them too You curse our dearest and our holiest things No pity have you nor faith Hungry our children are dying on the road And we submit out of pity for them Our lives would not be such dreadful things  If we had land  The cemetery that was ours in the village You wanted it for wheat We behind the plough   Roumanian Poems  Ploughing O God it is too dreadful Out come bones oh what a sin They are the bones of our own flesh and blood But what is that to you You took us out naked from our homes In frost and wind you took us Even as you took our dead out of their graves Oh for the dead and for their sake  We want land  We would like to know we long to know That our bones shall lie still in the grave That children of yours will not sin With us when we shall be dead Orphans and all who are dear to us If they should wish to weep on our graves They would not know what earth we lie in Because even for a grave we have no land And we are all Christians  And we want land  You have put seed of wheat in the field But we have buried here our forefathers and fathers Mothers sisters and brothers Away you heretics Our land is dear and holy to us Because it is our cradle and our grave   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  With hot blood always we have defended it And all the waters that moistened it Are but tears that we have shed  We want land  We have no time even for praying Because our time is in your hands We have still a soul in our breast It seems you have forgotten All of you have made an oath That we shall have no rights no words to say Weapons and tortures when we protest Loads and chains when we move And dull lead when exhausted we cry  That we want land  We have no strength and we can t go on To live always a life of beggary And of tortures put upon us By the bosses brought by winds Oh beware you God Almighty That we ask not for land but for blood When the time shall come that we can endure no more When hunger shall rouse us all beware of us Even were you all Christs beware  Even in your graves From the Roumanian of George Cosbuc   Roumanian Poems  PEASANT LOVE SONGS  I  He  In the garden of my sweetheart Sing two birds beautifully And the sun proudly shines And my darling sits and dreams Near the garden of my sweetheart Runs a river clear and crystal Where my darling sits and weeps  She  When you are here little man I dress all the time like a bride Wearing flowers and pearls So you will like them Since you have gone away little man The red belt and the tulip have vanished It is so sad Green leaf of the citron My little man has gone to the army He is gone and does not write to me Neither on the leaves nor on the river Nor on the wings of the wind  II  Bad O mother is fever But far far worse is love   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  For fever you can eat and drink But for love there is naught but pain From fever my mother can cure me But love is far from her care From fever the priest can pray me But not from the evil of love All of us learn this evil As did I a year from last spring The longing is slowly killing me Yes love is an evil thing  III  If you did not love me little man God shall curse you for it You should marry nine times And you should have nine boys You should have a girl too She shall bring you water in prison Because when you left me You broke my heart and my love  IV  Little man tell me is it true Be honest and tell me please Do you love me or not   Roumanian Poems  If you like me only a little Take any road that you wish But never the one that leads to my house  V  Goodbye darling good luck  Remain beautiful as a violet In a glass on the table  VI  Beautiful girl with blonde hair When I see you I begin to lean Like the leaves in the acacia When the wind is blowing through them Like the leaves of the oak tree I lean When the breeze is blowing through them  VII  I had a beautiful neighbor And a path to her garden But she went and got married And said not a word to me I would have taken her myself If she had married three villages away It wouldn t have hurt me so   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But she married a man down our street The third door from my mother s home When I am in I hear her voice When I go out I see her face It makes my heart burn like fire  THE CONSCRIPT  I  Down there in the prairie Met two brothers from the army Said one brother to the other Take this saddle from my horse And strike me on the head What shall we two do at home Mother father both are dead The cattle have grown old in the stable Where the house stood all is grass  II  Mountain mountain hard rock Let the youths pass by Let them go to be shepherds So they may run away from the army   Roumanian Poems  The army is a yoke of wood Which the boys pull until they die The army is a yoke of brass That they pull without ceasing  III  When a man goes to the army The house becomes so poor Children have not even a hearth If some day they grow up They will not know they had a father  IV  Why are you leaning pine of the woods Without swaying and so sad  Why shouldn t I bend so sadly When near me stand three woodsmen with their axes They ve come to chop me down And put me in three wagons And take me to their town Just to make of me a prison Four stern walls they ll make of me Where bravest men shall die  Translated by Maurice Aisen  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COMMENTS AND REVIEWS  A FRENCH POET ON TRADITION  Bouvard penchait vers le neptunisme PÃ©cuchet au contraire Ã©tait plutonien Flaubert  We must not boast too much of tradition It is no great merit to place our feet exactly in the tracks which the road indicates it is a natural tendency Though it is not very wrong to give way to this tendency it is better to attempt a new path Necessarily it becomes confounded here and there with the old We must resign ourselves but without arrogance The deed is less meritorious than unavoidable  Tradition is a great power opposing the originiality of writers That is why the present so strangely resembles the immediate past which again resembles the preceding past This subjection which is always very oppressive even in epochs of apparent literary innovation tends to become a real yoke when the fashion is obedience to tradition Hence the literary eighteenth century hence the literature of the First Empire  There is the continuous tradition and there is the renewed tradition They must not be confounded The seventeenth century believed that it was renewing the bond with antiquity The romanticists believed that they had re discovered the Middle Ages These discontinued traditions are more fertile when the period which is renewed is distant and unknown   A French Poet on Tradition  It seems then that today would be a propitious moment for renewing the seventeenth century It is an illusion The seventeenth century with its appearance of distance is infinitely near us It has served as a part of our education It is known even to those who have not frequented it We still breathe its atmosphere Everything derived from it would savor of imitation  The seventeenth century is relative to the renaissance in the position that we are to romanticism the seventeenth century does not continue the renaissance for there are erasures changes in taste it does take up the renaissance again but unconsciously and thanklessly Does it not seem to us that romanticism understood nothing of its own work We have attempted to refashion it with an unconsciousness comparable to that of the seventeenth century The works of George Sand and of Alexandre Dumas seem absurd to us we deny their genius but we refashion them We are as incapable of refashioning the novels of Balzac and of Stendhal as the seventeenth century was of refashioning Montaigne and Rabelais  You take literary tradition as far back as the seventeenth century Why Is it from ignorance of the past Do you not know that our great literary centuries were the twelfth and thirteenth otherwise good judges would not prefer the Vie de Saint Alexis to a tragedy by Racine  I like the seventeenth century so much that its most furious admirers will never succeed in disgusting me with it But   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  if I had to pick out a unique book I should take it from the nineteenth century  Tradition I find it everywhere All the past can be a part of tradition Why this and not that Why the laborious mysticism of Bossuet and not the spontaneous irony of Voltaire  Tradition is a long chain with alternate rings of gold and lead You do not accept the whole of tradition Then tradition is a choice and not a fact Considered as a fact tradition is merely a mass of contradictory tendencies  As soon as we choose we commit an act of arbitrary criticism  The true masters of tradition were those who like Sainte Beuve despised nothing and wished to understand everything  Do you believe that anyone who goes back no farther than Flaubert and Baudelaire can possess a good literary tradition I know such men and women and they astonish me with the delicacy of their taste  Tradition is sometimes nothing more than a bibliography sometimes a library BrunetiÃ¨re was a bibliography Sainte Beuve a library  The best French writer of the seventeenth century is HÃ©lisenne de Crenne I was informed by a woman who possessed a somewhat feminist erudition and who besides that was a bibliophile  People who say to me You are in the tradition of Montaigne amuse me for I am no great reader of the Essays   A French Poet on Tradition  a fact of which I am almost ashamed The greater part of the discoveries of professors on the formation and tradition of minds is of this sort The traditional man cannot see analagous tendencies in two minds without thinking that the later comer is an imitator of the earlier School habits  My tradition is not only French it is European I cannot deny Shakespeare Dante and Byron who taught me what poetry is not Goethe who enchanted my reason nor Schopenhauer who began my philosophical education I cannot deny Nietzsche who gave a principle for my repugnance to spiritualistic morality I cannot deny Swift and Cervantes And yet the two first books which opened the world to my soul were Stendhal s Amour and Flaubert s Madame Bovary found in a cupboard of the house  A curate who taught me Latin during the war when the schools were shut revealed MoliÃ¨re to me I have always been grateful to curates on that account The remainder of the classics were matters for lessons and impositions I read them much later in life Such is my tradition  What most strikes me in the young men of today is their docility They learn what is taught them In my time a professor had no authority We recognized in him a mission for preparing us for a degree  I have only enjoyed that which does not teach This plunged me into the Latin of the Middle Ages I have never put foot in the Sorbonne except to look at pictures Puvis de Chavannes and the frescoes of Mile   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Dufau It is apparent how much I have been inspired by discussing the teaching at the Sorbonne  When I see a hand painted on a wall indicating a direction I instinctively look the opposite way In the street I always walk against the crowd I go where nobody goes The voice crying Follow the crowd makes me afraid  I have often fought against my natural tendencies often praised a state which was quite inaccessible to me and several of my books are merely protests against myself For a long time I have had no aggressive opinions on anything but with the dÃ©bris of my old convictions deeper convictions have been formed in me with which I judge even those matters on which I am silent  We are always tempted to imitate what we love when we do not love enough If we push love as far as admiration we become discouraged from imitation  The true classics of the seventeenth century the models of all men of taste are today forgotten They were Patru Balzac d Ablancourt Boileau in his day was a breaker of dishes  The punishment of the tribe of professors is that it is eternally destined to despise La Fontaine alive and to venerate him dead The great classic poet was first of all a kind of Ponchon who entered life with his hat over one ear and with a girl on each arm He has the reputation of a ThÃ©ophile but La BruyÃ¨re at that time still hesitated between ThÃ©ophile and Malherbe   A French Poet on Tradition  The true tradition of the French mind is the liberty of the mind To discuss all questions anew to admit none save those which can be resolved a priori only to admit the best reasons and to consider as the best those which contain a principle of independence T o remember that no tradition is worth the tradition of liberty To be oneself to disregard those who speak to one in the name of a dogma but not to be one s own dupe and not to wish to impose on others that liberty of which the constitution of their brains renders them incapable  Preferences a good word to use in a matter of literary or even philosophical taste It contains no negation no dogmatism  Yet some negations are necessary there must also be a little dogmatism Affirm valiantly what you like Then you also are a tradition  And you are more complex than you imagine However religious you are be certain you are also slightly Voltairian However positive you think yourself you contain in yourself so much mysticism that you would be terrified if you could see everything clearly Your admiration is for the great classics but if you were quite sincere you would admit that nothing has so taken you as the beautiful works of romanticism  At bottom everything in literature is useless except literary pleasure but literary pleasure depends upon the quality of sensibility All discussions die against the wall of personal sensibility which is flesh on the inside and on the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  outside is a wall of stone There is a way to turn it about but this you do not know  We have put art above everything and it must remain there in spite of those who wish to replace it by opinions I put Candide and RenÃ© into my sack Take away your Voltairian blague and Chateaubrian faith they have nothing to do with me  The French tradition is so vast so contradictory that it lends itself to all tastes A famous poet once told me that his master was Dorat Why not I might have liked Dorat myself if I had known him  How heavy is the burden of this literary tradition which goes from Emile Deschamps to Verlaine across Villon Rabelais Ronsard Montaigne Malherbe Corneille Bossuet Voltaire Rousseau Chateaubriand Hugo Sainte Beuve Flaubert and so many others It is chaos a bog in the forest We can no longer see the sky Cut them down Cut them down  They have taken beforehand all my works all my phrases all my ideas Oh these obligatory ancestors They bind me They suffocate me Far from drawing tighter the bonds of tradition we should release the brains which it binds Bend your branches great tree  Flecte ramos arbor alta  What we need is less of models and more of the free light of life which you hide from us Remy de Gourmont Authorized translation by Richard Aldington   Mr Lindsay on Primitive Singing  MR LINDSAY ON PRIMITIVE SINGING  Mr Yeats asked me recently in Chicago What are we going to do to restore the primitive singing of poetry I find what Mr Yeats means by the primitive singing of poetry in Prof Edward Bliss Reed s new volume on the English lyric He says in his chapter on the definition of the lyric With the Greeks Song was an all embracing term It included the crooning of the nurse to the child the half sung chant of the mower or sailor the formal ode sung by the poet In all Greek lyrics even in the choral odes music was the handmaid of verse the poet himself composed the accompaniment Euripides was censured because Iophon had assisted him in the setting of some of his dramas  Here is pictured a type of Greek work which survives in American vaudeville where every line may be two thirds spoken and one third sung the entire rendering musical and elocutionary depending largely upon the improvising power and sure instinct of the performer  I respectfully submit The Firemen s Ball as an experiment in which I endeavor to carry this vaudeville form back towards the old Greek precedent of the half chanted lyric In this case the one third of music must be added by the instinct of the reader He must be Iophon And he can easily be Iophon if he brings to bear upon the piece what might be called the Higher Vaudeville imagination The essential points are close attention to the turning point in   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the middle of the piece and delicate rendering of the first half of the second section set in abrupt contrast to the second half in which the death whisper of True Love and if you will of all fine things is drowned by the noise of the brass band But his cry is drowned by the proud bandmaster  The first half of the third section including the quotation could be intoned in a semi priestly manner Then comes the final clamor of the engines  The Santa FÃ© Trail is another experiment in this manner  Big general contrasts between the main sections should be the rule of the first attempts at improvising It is the hope of the writer that after two or three readings each line will suggest its own separate touch of melody to the performer who has become accustomed to the cadences Let him read what he likes read and sing what he likes sung  The actual Firemen s Ball occurred in Springfield Illinois November 13 1913 The vast I N G Arsenal was jammed with fire laddies and their sweethearts of an hour  N V L  DOINA  It is difficult to explain what the word Doina suggests to a Roumanian peasant It seems to mean the very spirit of the popular poetry which is sung by native bards to the accompaniment of a simple instrument  Mr Aisen the translator of our group of poems who is a Roumanian living in Chicago says   Reviews  The Doina has been created by our bitterly persecuted peasants to keep themselves alive without it they would have disappeared Singing or chanting their sufferings imagining absent happiness has brought them consolation given them their only joy One poet sings to the Doina Stay with us for you are our Queen if you go away we shall have nothing to live for  Living through their poetry the peasants had to create more and more The Doina is an immense body of wonderful poetry George Cosbuc the leader of these peasant poets and a man of genius expresses the very quintessence of the Doina His lyric We Want Land is the cry of the peasant that has gone on for centuries and still goes on  Indeed it is the cry of the Mexican peon today  REVIEWS  Love and Liberation by John Hall Wheelock Sherman French amp Co Mr Wheelock s verse has a true lyric quality it is  simple sincere spontaneous musical For the best things in this latest volume we can only be grateful And perhaps we should not complain if like Wordsworth and many another immortal he leaves the task of weeding out to his readers  But these are crowded days the poet should do his own weeding out especially in a large garden of love songs For one is cloyed by excess one wearies of repetition in these two hundred and thirty seven lyrics of love the good things are smothered by the over facile the sentimental one has to search too long for them   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And then while these poems seem sincere they come too easily In these days it were idle to criticize any frank revelation of the reserves of passion but one has a right to demand that such a revelation shall be as it were dragged out of the depths of human agony and rapture that it shall seem reluctant in proportion to its intimacy In these lyrics is no reluctance there is ecstasy even to the very word on every page scattered so lavishly that sometimes it spills over and becomes ridiculous Indeed if Mr Wheelock had a sense of humor he would be saved such lines as  Where four lips are joined together Oh abandon yourself to an ecstasy sheer  But in spite of these lapses and of the over profusion of sweets in this volume one finds now and then a lyric as lovely as this Tell me why I love you Name yourself my Heart Every inward bounty Every outward art The hands the lips the eyes The beauty in your breast Your very inmost spirit Separate from the rest When your lips have ceased When your words have done I will answer you Not for these alone Also there are a few fine poems on other themes as The Return to New York and the song first printed in POETRY Shed my Song on the Feet of All Men In all these best things one feels warmth of sincerity real tenderness and clear lyric simplicity H M   Reviews  Little Verse for a Little Clan by F D W Privately printed  Now and then in some stray book of poems the personal note is struck with singular poignancy The book is a confessional where the hidden penitent feels deep relief in pouring out his story to the mysterious listener behind the veil This tiny half anonymous volume is of that kind and its simple and humble lyric cry comes from a weary and bewildered heart chained to the treadmill which yet hears now and then through the grinding whir of the machinery strains of a far away music  It is flute like music never loud or rich but often delicate and clear manifestly the utterance of a fine spirit The first stanza of O Dulcis Pimplea strikes the key note  Never was I a hoarder All that I had I spent Upon the twilight border Of dreams I pitched my tent The wind to me is brother The stars are kind as bread The old brown earth my mother Is pillow for my head  Adversity Keats Titian s Mary Because Flawed and Metamorphosis might be quoted as fitly as this one called Sacrifice  As love s last treasure to the fire you bore What was it lured your hand You did not speak nor I but all the more I could not understand  Winged words once passed our lips I know But there all words seemed vain   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The while before that flame we trembled so Like reeds beneath blown rain  At last it fluttered wavered paused and fell What was it loosed your hand Propitiation to what heaven or hell Do you yet understand  H M  Unconditioned Songs Anonymous Sydney J Endacott  Melbourne  From Australia comes a pleasant little volume anonymous called Unconditioned Songs Perhaps its charm or a good part of it lies in the fact that it makes so little pretense at being great poetry These are simple but genuine little songs the occasional flutings one would say of a young and very active man who turns to poetry when there is no hard work to be done at the moment And because he takes it so naturally he has given us what so often eludes the frantic striving of our muse kissed youth a true and faithful portrait of his own emotions  The songs are sometimes derivative as to form and not always clearly crystallized as to content but they have a distinctly personal tang and a pleasant one They have no titles but of the lyrics the two beginning I want to go away away and If I reach the ocean ever are perhaps the most distinguished and of the others They made me foreman of the job and Who smashed the sliprails down  E T   Notes  Men of No Land by Mildred McNeal Sweeny T Fisher  Unwin London  Men of No Land is a book of creditable craftsmanlike verse of a rather unusually even quality This is perhaps unfortunate since though there is nothing very bad in it there is by the same token nothing very good They are conscientious transcriptions of emotional facts but they are quite lacking in the vitality this method often brings forth Any one of these verses taken singly would probably have more effect than a whole book E T  The Foothills of Parnassus by John Kendrick Bangs Mac  millan  This is a book of the fifth age of man full of wise saws and modern instances full too of Mr Bangs characteristic humor It is homely wisdom treading sometimes on the heels
