ferns and flowers Rock towers Watch the invading shadows  Hills mother children Hills watch while children sleep  Fathomed in coulees The spirit water falls Say all there is to say   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A NATIVE  There ain t no poetry Like these middlin hills And a slow stream gurglin over stones Them pines has lived four hundred years And asked nothin of no one Straight and tall and strong Nothin crooked about a pine Religion I call it Pointing to the sky And slinging incense free Did you ever hear A cedar valley moan a dirge Or sing an anthem  NOTHIN SOMETHIN  It ain t worth nothin as land goes And yet it s somethin Kinda nice A hill of boulders Smilin in the sun I only took it because twas cheap I wasn t one of them That had the earnin guts To pick and choose My girl and I have worked   Laura Sherry  To coax the crops around these stones She was pretty once Lord now her bones stick out Like ridge poles in a tent I ain t complainin The land She d say it wasn t any good Except to hold the world together It s held her And me  HOWARD BENTLY  Jim Burgantine said I f any other man had tried To put over a plug hat In this Western burg He d a been egged  Howard Bently Didn t follow fashion He brought his hat from Massachusetts It was a good hat And lasted forty years For the matter of that Eight months of the calendar He didn t wear a hat He never did unnecessary things   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He split a cracker If the scales tipped over a pound He split a cracker If the scales tipped under a pound When a neighbor was sick He sat up nights And took the orphans home  Twenty five thousand dollars Earned in his corner grocery Was scattered about the country Among the struggling farmers Howard Bently died Without trying to collect  He never said unnecessary words He was a quiet man No tombstone Shouts his name above the sod  GRAND DAD S BLUFF  I knelt all day Grand dad Pleading with you But you had nothing to say Night fell And a message came Through your ravines   Laura Sherry  It did not speak either  But I heard it pass among the leaves of the trees  I drank it through my nostrils  As one drinks wine through the mouth  And it tingled to the finger tips of my spirit  I came to you Grand dad with my heart  God bless you Grand dad  IN MIST  When you can see the ground s breath And the sky goes muggy And drops before the world Like a perspiring window glass When beasts and humans creep to cover And the steam boats speak fog language The farm buildings sit still Folding their hands As if they hadn t a thing in the world to do A chimney s belch smudges into nothing The earth s breath noses around the roots of trees Heaven mist seeps through branches And wraps the country s heart  LIGHT MAGIC  The valley curves like a bridge span to the sky Blue granite stew pans spill pink begonias along the road   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The town hall blazing red focuses the red stubble of the  fields Which stretch away to gold stacked corn stalks And Wisconsin hills piled cubes of red and yellow The sunset catches the landscape in layers Its amber floats a banner of pastels around the town  LATE AUTUMN IN THE HILLS  A flock of birds Spurts down the trail of autumn  Bare hills  Wrap fog blankets about them And nod A whirl of wind  Scatters wild rice over the lake  There is a shake of snow in the air My boat moors in the sedges  My hand Droops over the side of the boat My fingers Touch a lotus pod The seeds rattle in the husk  Autumn is anchored   Laura Sherry  THE SEASON  It is mating time How can I go gipsying  It is planting time How can I go adventuring  It is harvest time In the twilight the camp fire smoulders On the hearth stone Ashes hold memories  It is dying time And the unknown road  Laura Sherry   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ANTAGONISMS  LAUGHTER See I thrust at you laughter Clusters of pomegranate in the sun  See I dangle clusters of red sun ripened laughter Before your eyes that are colorless Like the eyes of the fishes  What are you peering at Sallow face Your hand It is limp and clammy It has never clutched at a thing Strongly Those pale pinched lips of yours Have never blossomed under kisses Have never whispered little words Luminous with tenderness  Rigid one My laughter Let it shake you like a wind Red wind Tearing to shreds Your pale hypocrisy   Emmy Veronica Sanders  My laughter Let it thaw Those boulders of black ice Your hard moralities Your bleak utilities And sow violets in their place  There is laughter ringing softly From the golden shell of the sky There is laughter ringing in the rills That come tripping down the bronze and purple hillside Insolently Trees are swaying to and fro Laughter in the rustle and the flitter of their leaves And the air is warm and tremulous with laughter Rising from the lips that lie Mute beneath tombstones  Deaf one Listen  To the scarlet wind  There are sobs in the wind  INTO THESE THINGS  The grasp of their hands has grown cold Furnaces needed Red fire   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Their little souls  Their cowardly cramped souls  Bigness went  To steel and to stone  Slow and feeble their breath  Do you hear the white steam  Panting  There is no music in their hearts  Engines know rhythm  Engines make  Loudness  If their eyes are Without longing Do not numbers  Create themselves  And if their lips show not The deep proud curve of passion Are not cities Passionate  Furnaces steel towers engines cities And the pale eyed people crawling Emptied Into these things   Emmy Veronica Sanders  PASSING  I am tired of roads I am tired of the going the going And I am tired of passing people  In the east a narrow streak of gold And the flutter of wings of the little desires Bleakness of snow in the north And in the south the taste of ashes on hot lips Westward a loneliness Roads over sand and roads over snow and roads across  rivers  I am tired of roads I am tired of the going the going And I am tired of passing people  I am tired of passing them on the glistening pavements  under the lamplight And in the places where you order things to eat I am tired of passing them at noon under the flat stare of  the sun And in the street cars the elevated trains and the taxis Passing glances and feet passing Feet of six million people passing and gliding by Shuffling and jostling by Passing passing And those that pass on the screen in the movies   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And the people that pass slowly hurriedly With a half caught gest through the pages of books  I am tired of the winds that hasten by And of the little waves that skip and never once look back And of stars coming and going  Fleeting glimpses Hands fluttering past like autumn leaves  I am tired of roads I am tired of the going the going And I am tired of passing people  HILL SPEECH  I listened to the hills as they spoke At nightfall  I listened to the haughty calm flowing of line speech And to vehement words Jagged and bitten into the sky face I saw hieroglyphs scrawled on a pale wall of sky With fingers of granite There was motion gripping the masses Urging and waving Onward I heard cadences of hill speech   Emmy Veronica Sanders  Falling and rising Softly With soothing interference  And there was one standing alone on the smoldering  horizon Standing aloof and detached Always Saying I and I and I Answering No and No and No Always To the biting words and to the flowing line speech And to the hieroglyphs scrawled with fingers of granite  There was one Saying No To the dull gray abysses Of sky and of sea Saying No To the masses  Emmy Veronica Sanders   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TWO SONNETS  ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME  She bore the smear of insult on her face And heard the ruffian voices and the din Of penny horns and whistles that had been  Her heart and she knew only this disgrace  That one had dressed her in a ragged gown Caesar had been met in various ways Like thought too vast to feel or to erase  She knew the hosts of Rome were sweeping down  In various fashions Caesar had been met With crimson violence or more brilliant lies The poisoned fang or chain of chariot She did not choose but slain by her surprise She could not see the choice that waited yet The veiled derisive plebeian disguise  JEST  In a gutter between wind bitten glaciers A little man stands blowing upon a toy Is he not mad is he not audacious In such a curious place in such employ  The wind s blue insult swells upon his face A whisking hunger like a mouse at bay   Louis Grudin  Has cowed his eyes which vaguely in disgrace Bear up the heavy menace of Broadway  A dim presentiment of an awful hoax Scalded his heart and simmered to his feet The secret jest that counted off the strokes Of hours men spent at various tasks secrete That made of some of them quite obvious jokes And saved for others labors more discreet  Louis Grudin  ANGUISH  Pain is cutting through my heart Like a thin knife With the keen abiding smart Men call life  Pillowed cool in marble state Ah let me sleep And afar from love or hate Bury me deep  Sally Bruce Kinsolving   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REFLECTIONS  DUET  I sing with myself  Out of my sorrow I ll build a stair And every tomorrow Will climb to me there  With ashes of yesterday  In its hair  My fortune is made Of a stab in the side My debts are paid In pennies of pride  Little red coins  In a heart I hide  The stones that I eat Are ripe for my needs My cup is complete With the dregs of deeds  Clear are the notes  Of my broken reeds  I carry my pack Of aches and stings Light with the lack Of all good things   Leonora Speyer  But not on my back Because of my wings  AT THE HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE  They said to me We are not crazy dear But they are mad and so they keep us here  I thought We are all mad in this walled place And out beyond and through all time and space Save he who looks his madness in the face  SONG OVERHEARD  I wrote your name within my heart Most carefully I never could remember names or faces And then one day I lost my heart along the shining places  I must have let it fall Plucking a flower I did not want And listening to a bird I did not see Now would I call And you would answer me  Do hearts have wings I am so careless about losing things   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  KIND FATE  You strike at hearts of gentle ways  And in their grief they give you praise  Once once you struck at me And will not strike again You do not like to bruise your hands On hearts that hoard their bright hard pain  THE STRONGHOLD  Here he lies Under the solemn stones Secure from Life a little while Old Death With his ready smile Busy among his bones  LOOKING ON  I urged my mind against my will My will shook like a rocking wall But did not fall My mind was like a wind swept tree And neither knew the victory  I dashed my mind against my will They did not break or bend or spill But in my heart the songs grew still   Leonora Speyer  A TRUTH ABOUT A LIE  I lied trusting you knew I could not lie to you Beloved friend I lied and am forgiven but I Cannot forgive that you believed my lie  COUPLETS  Forest Fires  Summer is burning From trees red crown Ashes of June pour hotly down  Night of Stars  They crowded round me more and more I had to shove to shut the door  Ascent  Mountains take too much time Start at the top and climb  Reproach  You gave me wings to fly Then took away my sky  Down to the Heights  In the deep valleys and deeper still I found my heights against my will  Leonora Speyer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SHADOW SONGS  LAMENTATION  Chrysanthemums and late roses And the plane leaf s fall All that is left us now Hoarsely the flower girls cry Pale shake the street lamp lights Chilled gusts come puffing by Sigh the poor year away All that is left us now Regrets without perfume dead thoughts Chrysanthemums and late roses  VIRGIN MOON  Having chattered out The overbrimming of their light hearts When the old moon had traveled over the housetops Far enough to dangle dancing shadows of leaves Across their bed Veils of silence also were let down And they slept virgin beside virgin The whisper of leaves outside the window Filled the room Long after the moon had trailed Her net of shadow boughs across their dreams And was gone    Iris Barry  AN UNPOSTED LETTER  How bitter must the smile Of the wise Future be Behind her veil O letter of last year Can my hopes and aims  Like moons Have changed so Those dead desires Like shriveled fruits Hang shamed On the bough of time  NOCTURNE  The veil of light slipped  From the sky  Only greyness  And in the valley  One home light  Not mine  I most remember then  Shadows of boughs  Lattice wise falling  On white walls  Of my home  Beneath the moon  Iris Barry   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A TRIFOLIATE  BEAUTY  Over beauty I am a weeping willow  I begged of God to grant me a look at beauty  And He sent me traveling a billion years  To come to this world  I came my way an empty vessel longing for beauty  I shall go my way fulfilled glorifying beauty  When I look on beauty  I secure a day s provision  Thus I accumulate food for another billion years  When I see beauty  It propels wheels in me  And puts me in communication with God instantly  To thank Him that I am arrived  My only grief in life is to see a thing without beauty Over beauty I am a weeping willow  MY WEDDING  My adopted little sister dreams As soon as they heard The wedding news of their brother Shouted Brother our brother You have cared for and sustained us All our painful lives   Leon Herald  For this hour we have been waiting The hour of our culmination Brother you were betrothed when you were born Then they danced alone to the garden To gather star daisies  Now comes the lady of my heart In her purple bordered lightning colored gown The maiden Day in whom I breathe comes With the sun bouquet at her breast Led by my sister dreams the maids of honor And Life the best man leads me to her  The pagan musicians Ocean and Wind Ocean the pianist with jeweled and manicured fingers Thunders and pounds the wide ranged key board of the  shore And the Wind with hair unbound Holding the violin woods under her chin Thrills my bride and her maids of honor And Life my best man And me  IN YOUR EYES  To M H  Never before did I dare To look in your eyes To see one s self In love s mystic eyes   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Is leading  Life in Paradise  Creator dreamed  And looked deep in space  Then Being the grace of His dream  Began to evolve  Thus He became famous  And God is His name  When the light from my eyes  Falls in yours  Immortal songs will take course Tuneful songs the grace of my dreams  Leon Herald  TRIAD  In the church of St Pierre August 1918  Old music wove its beauty through each word Which echoed from the chancel down the nave  Old beauty of fled twilights stained each beam Carved like the fingers of some soul in prayer  A woman veiled in black knelt on the stone The beauty of old suffering on her face  Arthur H Nethercot    A WALKING POEM  I believe there is moving more than colored jackets Down the street among the city rackets I do not think the sun rain on the corner wall Is all  I cannot think the swirl is much More than a little touch Of souls to steady to an equipoise Their private thunderings the subterranean noise  For I have gathered scowl and elbow thrust And glint of pupil of the eye there must I think be lashing foam in canyons under there And this a heavy silence on the little empty air  I do not think her ankles mincing through And round smile are the flowers that we thought we knew Red jacket stealthy lioness yawning in the wood And stealthy passion creeping in the blood  The sun moves and the colors of the air I think each canyon river keeps its flowing there Within the deepest constancy Call then the sun and jackets pageantry  Edward Sapir   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  THE LITTLE DEITY ALONE IN THE DESERT  My life is here A contemplation of slow days and distant women  Women standing in the sky line As if about to turn into their shawls and leave their doorways  The illimitable movement of my hand Across the desert Contrives against their motions and my being  LATE WINTER  The duller plains of dawn near this Gray dobe of bare fruit trees  hesitant A foot upon the sill  A REQUIEM FOR THE MEMORY OF BEES  Lake Michigan  A brown flowering tree On twilight Was but a farther spinning of  the sprinkled blackbirds   Yvor Winters  A woman walking The evening dying Her dress among low blossoms  Among low blossoms Lake water humming  CHICAGO SPRING  Before returning to Santa Fe  I walk on the streets Before nightfall The lake clear and still Between young leaves  My body is gentle As the light on the pavement My fingers play on the air Like evening wind running in leaves  But there is no one Only return Only old roads of last summer An old fence like dead leaves  The hand of God Is heavier than mountains It stands on the air Like an odor   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  OLD SPRING  The flowering crabtrees Have melted like the twilights  Here a brown road Dull amid bark shadows And an old man walking  And between the woods The dandelions Like dried scattered leaves  But in my country The spring is old The violet and red Are laid in earth Will not be lost  And I there standing Or moving slowly  THE SILENT DAYS  Here men go In and out of doors And women stand  Beneath dry trees A child drifts and is still   Yvor Winters  With brevity  Men break a bitter bread  My books Are fallen leaves I unidentified As books passed by at will  LAMENT BESIDE AN ACEQUIA FOR THE WIFE OF AWA TSIREH  Two caballeros Smooth in the valley Laughed their horses bucked The summer foaming  San Ildefonso  In colors  Faint as dust  Flower dripping dancers  One cannot think  So far away  And thinking  Women die  O Awa tsireh  The faded roads May never move    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE FRAGILE SEASON  The scent of summer thins The air grows cold  One walks alone And chafes one s hands  The fainter aspens Thin to air The dawn Is frost on roads  This ending of the year Is like the lacy ending of a last year s leaf  Turned up in silence  Air gives way to cold  Yvor Winters COMMENT  MEA CULPA  WITH this number POETRY completes a decade October first it will be ten years old The eve of one s birthday may be the appropriate moment for reflection and more or less penitential confession  Mea culpa so the orthodox confession begins with a humble mind must one approach the sacred closet And the mood is not difficult considering how frequently we are prodded toward humility You have wasted a great opportunity writes one correspondent You are possibly five per cent better than The Century says another no less trenchant an authority than Ezra Pound I have loved POETRY but your disparagement of the great Rostand makes me wish I had a five year subscription to withdraw deposes a third Will you never stop dealing out free verse and pretending it is poetry cries a fourth And a fifth complains that only the rhymer s tinkle rings through our pages now  All this and much more on the artistic side Of course we might put up a defence setting forth our manifold achievements but that would not be fitting in a penitent And the editor realizes only too deeply the magazine s many errors and derelictions whatever it has done for the cause unquestionably it might have done much more under the all wise guidance of complete and perfect competence   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But it is on the business side that the editor is most sincerely penitent and humble here somehow or other we have indeed missed our opportunity we have not persuaded the poetry loving public to subscribe in sufficient numbers to support the magazine Ten years ago our guarantors more than an hundred they were then accepted the responsibility of a rash experiment for the benefit of an art then neglected and decried It seemed reasonable to hope that within five years a circulation of ten thousand or more would assure the magazine s continuance by making it modestly self supporting Now that twice five years have passed there is still no prospect of the fulfilment of this hope the future of the magazine is precarious because it still rests on the generosity and continued loyalty of its guarantors  The editor accuses herself If she had had a small modicum of ordinary business instinct she might have found a larger audience and rallied it to the support of the poets organ for imperfect as it may be POETRY is by general consent the leading organ of the art in the English speaking world There must be at least ten thousand people in this country who would wish to help support this organ if we could reach them and persuade them of their need of it of the country s need of it But unfortunately we have not known how to reach out and persuade Small advertising in these days of enormous expenditures for publicity is simply money wasted Circularizing in these days of over burdened   Mea Culpa  mails doesn t pay for the stamps on the envelopes Yet the public has become so accustomed to the advertiser s dope that they rely on it like a morphine eater and pay no attention to those who do not supply in conspicuous and never ceasing profusion the artificial stimulus  What is to be done The editor confesses frankly that she does not know The magazine ought to go on it would be bitterly missed this seems beyond question if one may believe the proofs that come by every mail and the emphatic assurances of people who know the work it is doing Its influence is out of proportion to its subscription list because it is widely quoted by the newspapers and is used in extenso by all the innumerable modern anthologists not to mention the young men and women far and near who receive from it their first stimulus toward artistic expression and feed their souls on it often in remote corners of this vast country and against formidable spiritual isolation  The editor is tempted to quote here an editorial which appeared in the magazine eight years ago this month By this time we should have outgrown the need of it but mea culpa it is as true now as it was then It was entitled A Word to Our Readers  Are you convinced of the value of our unique experiment for the support and encouragement of a universal and indispensable art Do you wish the magazine to continue beyond the period for which it is subsidized Do you wish its policy to be one of increasing liberality toward the poets and their public working always toward more just appreciation and recompense for the former and for the latter a presentation of the best the art has to offer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The permanence of the magazine lies not with us but with you Given life and health we can pledge to its support our best service and under the usual limitations of human error increasing knowledge and efficiency for there is much education in such work as this But our labor will not avail for permanence unless we can reach the public for poetry which must exist in this vast country and in the wide provinces of the English speaking world And we can not find that public unless you help us  We must be advertised by our friends Other advertising in these days of enormously expensive displays of it is costly and often futile We have preferred to reserve our endowment fund for our contributors the poets in order to increase the intrinsic value of the magazine The direct advertisement of recommendation is the only possible means of increasing its scope and influence  Thus you and you alone can give us really effective aid toward reaching a circulation large enough to enable us to stand alone You can help us in any or all of the following ways  First send or renew your own subscription  Second persuade one or more of your friends and neighbors to subscribe Third see that your social and literary clubs subscribe Fourth see that the public library in your town carries one or more  subscriptions Fifth talk about the magazine either praise or blame will indicate your interest  To those who wish to give more to the magazine than the amount of their subscription we extend a cordial invitation to join our body of guarantors Full guarantors pay fifty dollars a year or in a few instances one hundred They receive the magazine each month as many copies as they order and full reports once a year Like members of art institutes and of operatic dramatic and orchestral societies like donors of prizes and scholarships in schools and exhibitions of painting sculpture architecture and music like these our guarantors are patrons of a great art one which equally with the other arts needs public encouragement and even endowment if it is to achieve its triumphs By encouraging the art by staking something on their faith in those who practice it they increase their own enjoyment of it and receive   Mea Culpa  perhaps more than they give so that the adventure is of mutual benefit  Another way of contributing largely is to offer a prize This way is recommended especially to clubs We should like to give as many prizes annually as the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh or the Art Institute of Chicago  In this art an urgent need is for the endowment of scholarships especially traveling scholarships The modern world modern thought and art is cosmopolitan A young poet even more than a young aspirant in the other arts needs a certain amount of cosmopolitan training and experience For the lack of it he may develop narrowly remaining provincial and laggard minded It is an incredible and inexcusable omission that the expensively endowed American Academy at Rome does not include poets among the young artists it subsidizes indeed they are precisely the ones who would perhaps benefit the most by a few years residence in Rome The editor has in mind now three or four promising young poets to whom a scholarship would be of incalculable benefit  Many inspiring words encouraged me while I was explaining the project of the magazine to possible guarantors One of these a Chicago lawyer said Of course put me down I don t know any better way to pay my debt to Shelley What do you owe you who read this article to Shelley to Coleridge Milton Shakespeare to Moliere Dante Sappho Homer to all the great poets whose immortal singing has incalculably enriched life become an integral part of the mind of the race Have you ever felt an obligation to pay a little of that immeasurable debt Is there any other way to pay your debt to the great dead poets than by supporting and encouraging the poets now alive Among them may be the founders of a renaissance among them may be an immortal In a sense not only actual and immediate but permanent mystic and profound their fate is in your hands  Like many another penitent confessing his sins the editor ends with a nefarious attempt to shift or at least to share responsibility She does not know how to make the magazine self supporting do you  H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ON TRANSLATING CHINESE POETRY  II  Probably most of us met these poems first in the translations by scholars Herbert A Giles of Cambridge or Legge of Oxford Legge s translations are in scrupulous prose Giles in rhymed verse which Arthur Waley says combines rhyme and literalness with wonderful dexterity Giles translations are the more widely known but are now rather scoffed at by many of the newer school of poets In justice to Giles however it must be remembered that at least the greater part of these translations appeared in 1896 before the present movement towards simplification of poetry was started and before the English poets themselves had discovered that English may be used with classic simplicity They are therefore in a poetic idiom foreign to our day But we owe Giles none the less a great debt of gratitude on this as well as on other scores  In 1913 Helen Waddell published a slender volume Lyrics from the Chinese the first translations into English so far as my knowledge goes which belong to the new movement in English poetry They are done from Legge s literal translations and although they have never been so generally known as they deserve to be they seem to me to controvert the claim made by the publishers of Amy Lowell s and Florence Ayscough s new volume Fir flower Tablets that This is the first time that an English version of Chinese poems has been   On Translating Chinese Poetry  at once the work of a sinologue and a poet They are in rhymed verse as direct as Sara Teasdale s lyrics and to me often very beautiful Here for instance is her version of one of the odes  How say they that the Ho is wide When I could ford it if I tried How say they Sung is far away When I can see it every day  Yet must indeed the Ho be deep When I have never dared to leap And since I am content to stay Sung must be very far away  If one bears in mind the fact that the original is rhymed and patterned does Miss Lowell s new free verse version with its American colloquialisms seem an improvement  Who says the Ho is wide Why one little reed can bridge it  Who says that Sung is far I stand on tiptoe and see it  Who says the Ho is wide Why the smallest boat cannot enter  Who says that Sung is far It takes not a morning to reach it  L Cranmer Byng with his A Lute of Jade and A Feast of Lanterns struck a more popular chord and it is perhaps a personal matter that they do not move me as the Waddell translations do They are partially rhymed and partially unrhymed To me it seems that they are not   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  quite one thing or the other neither very good English verse nor very scrupulous translations  Another interesting though slightly Latinized volume is Whitall s rendering of the French versions of Judith Gautier s Le Livre de Jade And we have had other sorts of translations the airy snatches of Ezra Pound some years ago who chose a single image that pleased him from a long poem and gave us that only the fantasies of E Powys Mathers so over decorated as to be genuinely dishonest the dreadful doggerel of W A P Martin the trite and wearisome mouthings of Charles Budd not to mention the numerous interpretations  Then came Arthur Waley s admirable translations at once so simple and so scholarly carrying with them an instant conviction of authenticity This we felt was the substance and spirit of these old poets at last  Yet such is the carping nature of mankind we no sooner had so much than we began to wish for the magic also For Mr Waley s word sense excellent as it is still falls short of the ultimate subtlety of magic It is probably with the hope of restoring this magic that Amy Lowell with Florence Ayscough and Witter Bynner with Dr Kiang Kang hu have now taken up the work Miss Lowell s book is a welcome addition since it gives us many new and charming poems in a contemporary technique Yet I for one cannot quite trust Miss Lowell She has given us so many racial interpretations Japanese Indian and others which were all essentially herself   On Translating Chinese Poetry  that when I find that this too reads like her own poems  doubt their essentially Chinese quality She has surely too vivid a personality to make a good translator Mr Bynner s book is not yet out but from the examples I have seen it promises to be the most satisfying of the free verse translations in the matter of magic  Such roughly is the history of the recent attempts to translate Chinese classical poetry into English Let me give for comparison three different versions of the same poem It is by the Lady Pan Chieh Yu chief favorite of the emperor who ruled China B C 36 32 and was sent him with a fan by the lady when she had been supplanted by a younger rival The first translation is by Giles in his history of Chinese literature  O fair white silk fresh from the weaver s loom Clear as the frost bright as the winter snow See friendship fashions out of thee a fan Round as the round moon shines in heaven above At home abroad a close companion thou Stirring at every move the grateful gale And yet I fear ah me that autumn chills Cooling the dying summer s torrid rage Will see thee laid neglected on the shelf All thought of bygone days like them bygone  Here is Ezra Pound s version he does not call it a  translation of the same from the first Imagist anthology  O fan of white silk  clear as frost on the grass blade  You also are laid aside  The third is Amy Lowell s from Fir flower Tablets   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Glazed silk newly cut smooth glittering white As white as clear even as frost and snow Perfectly fashioned into a fan Round round like the brilliant moon Treasured in my Lord s sleeve taken out put in Wave it shake it and a little wind flies from it How often I fear the autumn season s coming And the fierce cold wind that scatters the blazing heat Discarded passed by laid in a box alone Such a little time and the thing of love cast off  Perhaps by comparing the three the western reader may arrive at some idea of what the Chinese poem is like as a surveyor by taking three slants at a mountain can measure it And if he adds thereto a knowledge of the complex form in which it is written he may even get a fairly correct idea It is a laborious process but can one who does not read Chinese find a better  Eunice Tietjens  REVIEWS  HIS HOME TOWN  Slabs of the Sun burnt West by Carl Sandburg Harcourt Brace amp Co The books of this man are piling up Chicago Poems  Cornhuskers Smoke and Steel and now these Slabs all these since that day in 1914 when unknown to fame he stormed POETRY S doors and picked up the first Levinson Prize thereby exciting a loud hee haw of protest from the arbiters of taste indeed all these since 1916   His Home Town  when the first book was published Eight years and the arbiters of taste have come round so that two of these books have been beprized without arousing their derision Eight years and this radical of 1914 is becoming vieux jeu to the young radicals of 1922 who would elbow him out of the muses presence even as he unwittingly elbowed out Neihardt and George Sterling and Madison Cawein  What of this fourth book does it keep up the pace Well any book which contains The Windy City and Washington Monument by Night can not be said to show a flagging of poetic energy The former is more compact more definitely planned and shaped than either Prairie or Smoke and Steel and it carries its big subject throughout with an assured and easy power It is perhaps too early to say whether it contains passages of such imaginative intensity as a few in these other two long poems for example the finale of Prairie with the line The past is a bucket of ashes but it does achieve a certain splendor it is a magnificent interpretation of a great modern town with all her imperfections on her head and all her glories too  Let us examine this modern ode the poet s latest word about Chicago as Hog butcher of the world was his earliest The early poem had the forthright directness of a powerful etching done in a few bold lines The second swings a big brushful of color puts in background and foreground light and shadow shapes up a balanced   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  composition on a large canvas We see the lean hands of wagon men shaping the junk of the earth to a new city we see how the junk stood up into skyscrapers We hear the red men naming  The place of the skunk The river of the wild onion smell Shee caw go  And later the poet commands  Lash yourself to the bastion of a bridge And listen while the black cataracts of people go by baggage bundles balloons listen while they jazz the classics  And this is what we hear  Since when did you kiss yourself in And who do you think you are Come across kick in loosen up Where do you get that chatter  Beat up the short change artists They never did nothin for you How do you get that way Tell me and I ll tell the world I ll say so I ll say it is  You re trying to crab my act You poor fish you mackerel You ain t got the sense God Gave an oyster it s raining What you want is an umbrella  Hush baby It ain t how old you are It s how old you look   His Home Town  It ain t what you got It s what you can get away with  Tell em honey  Ain t it the truth sweetheart Watch your step You said it You said a mouthful  We re all a lot of damn fourflushers  The American temperament is there American good humor joshing itself in a slouching march movement of slang  We feel a big poet spirit going along with the founding of the city and the lifting up of the living lighted skyscrapers going along with all the man size jobs that changed a few huts on a marsh into a great modern town and there is a large broom sweeping irony for the comfortable people who profit by these labors in their smoothly ordered lives and for the superior people who criticize the results  It is easy to listen to the haberdasher customers hand each other their easy chatter it is easy to die alive to register a living thumbprint and be dead from the neck up  It is easy to come here a stranger and show the whole works write a book fix it all up it is easy to come and go away a muddleheaded pig a bum and a bag of wind  And then the spirit of the city rises and shakes off these little encumbrances with a grin Chicago fished from its depths a text Independent as a hog on ice   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  That grotesque old saying was as familiar as Yankee Boodle in my childhood for my father found it a beloved simile Applied to Chicago it is a true text in spite of the seeming sensitiveness of local pride And like other grotesques flirting for an instant their rags of scarlet it trails the purple shadow of tragedy  Forgive us if the monotonous houses go mile on mile Along monotonous streets out to the prairies If the faces of the houses mumble hard words At the streets and the street voices only say Dust and a bitter wind shall come Forgive us if  There are many ifs especially  Forgive us if we work so hard And the muscles bunch clumsy on us And we never know why we work so hard If the big houses with little families And the little houses with big families Sneer at each other s bars of misunderstanding Pity us when we shackle and kill each other And believe at first we understand And later say we wonder why  And out of it all beauty beauty beaten out of the innumerable desperate dreamful shifts of change  The library building named after Crerar naked as a stock farm silo light as a single eagle feather stripped like an airplane propeller takes a path up  Two cool new rivets say Maybe it is morning God knows  Put the city up tear the city down put it up again let us find a city Let us remember the little violet eyed man who gave all praying Dig and dream dream and hammer till your city comes   His Home Town  Every day the people sleep and the city dies every day the people shake loose awake and build the city again  I will die as many times as you make me over again says the city to the people  So the poet goes on to mention proud things there is a high pride throughout the poem as well as the hog on ice independence of the man who cares not whether all the world decries and defames Proud things such as  The jack knife bridge opening the ore boats the wheat barges passing through Three overland trains arriving the same hour  a carload of shorthorns  And the final section of the poem is an invocation to the winds the city s fierce breathing blessing and bane  Winds of the Windy City Winds of corn and sea blue Spring wind white and fighting winter gray Come home here they nickname a city for you  The winds of Chicago are in the poem it has a big sweeping generous movement It goes and it goes forward  Washington Monument by Night is one of its author s finest lyrics and that is saying a great deal At the Gates of Tombs has something of the big sad grotesque humor we remember in Losers and we linger a minute with Primer Lesson and the closing lines of Harsk harsk But the rest of the book seems loosely put together The unknown soldier poem And So Today says nothing   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  new or in a new manner surely there was a subject here but this serves up what we all read in the newspapers As for the title poem in the second section it succeeds at first in suggesting something of the exalted but flabbergasting bewilderment as of a man knocked cold by sublimity which overwhelms many a tourist at his first view of the Grand Canyon of Arizona The interview with God and the summing up of man s absurd incompetence are not bad through their rough and tumble humor one feels the deeper inexpressible emotion But the mood thins out lifting again for only the final lyric which is fine  Perhaps Mr Sandburg hasn t stayed long enough as yet in the sun burnt Far West He doesn t feel it as  deeply as he does his own Windy City H M MURIEL STUART The Cockpit of Idols by Muriel Stuart Ltd London Methuen amp Co  Courage and passion blow out the structure of these poems The initial idea is slight as in the heartrending tale of war It s Rose time Here and sometimes fantastic as in The Centaur s Love but always it is handled with sureness with a high fearlessness and passion is always there sweeping each poem along farther and farther away from the commonplace There is never any sentimentality even with such a subject as The Bastard Miss Stuart manages to keep gloriously free of this customary fem   Muriel Stuart  inine weakness This poem like most of the others is too long to quote in its entirety  Here thou art safe as roses in the bud Safe from the wind that will not spare the rose Here thou art daily and divinely fed  On holy wine and bread That none deny my body and my blood I housle thee myself the sacrament And I am great with thee as souls with God  Lie still awhile thy beauty builds my shame The shame thou dost so innocently bring At thy beseeching blood my blood grows tame Thy body makes my own most wearisome And with thy kindling lips my lips become Colder within me something daily dies Yet oh most sweet I do not quarrel thee For more desired thou art than chastity Closer thou art than eyelids over eyes Than kissing lips or clasping hands can be As flame with flame as tide with tide thou art Nearer much nearer than myself to me I carry Heaven beneath my laboring heart  In The Cockpit of Idols a young priest converses with a harlot a melodramatic theme yet it justifies itself because here again Miss Stuart is sure in her treatment and unfaltering in her courage And the inevitable and obvious end when the priest says  I walked with God in every noisy street And saw in every creature that passed by Christ go forth too and mingle with the crowd  though weak is forgiven because of such lines as   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  In the dim church the warm deep bosomed air Swelled on remembered music whose last note Yearned in the organ s throat  The shorter poems are like charming asides which are not unusual but linger because of the directness of their appeal For instance Common Fires  The fern and flame had fought and died together From fading front the failing smoke crept grey The heath drew close her old brown shawl of heather  And turned her face away  Today the bee no bell of honey misses The birds are nesting where the bracken lies Green tranquil deep quiet as dreams or kisses  On weary lips and eyes  The heath has drawn the blackened threads together My heart has closed her lips upon old pain But somewhere in my heart and in the heather  No bud shall grow again  Marion Strobel  TRANQUIL TUNES  Cross currents by Margaret Widdemer Harcourt Brace amp Co A pleasant and well mannered collection which has  what might be termed a stage presence for the fundamental idea of each poem and all of them have an idea though seldom a very original one is put across with authority Miss Widdemer is no novice Her ear is keenly attuned to the popular taste sometimes too keenly attuned for occasionally she overdoes her effort to please   Tranquil Tunes  and her verses become as conventionally sentimental as the Blue Danube waltz It is as though she shouted to her audience Stay with me I have pleased you I can please you still more And as a proof of it she offers Wisdom  I wonder was it well That you should lift your hand And call me from the withered ring I thought was fairyland  For where I heard the pipes and flutes  Now I can only hear A little sad wind blowing A little wind of fear  And where I saw wild banners wing Gold purple in the sky I see the world where sorry folk With heavy hearts go by  Oh it is true is true But oh the cruel hand That called me from the withered ring I thought was Fairyland  However though there are several poems as mild as the above and though we look in vain for unusual wording or rhythm or for an arresting simile nevertheless the poems have a charm of simplicity They are clear cut An emotion though at times a superficial one is there And in a number of instances most of which are to be found under the subdivision About Living there is delicacy of feeling knowledge of life and sweetness without sentimentality For instance Liberation   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I used to think I mattered so That when I laughed and when I cried  The sun and stars would turn to know If what I asked for was denied I did not know of this my pride  Nor how my thoughts with stars were strung Such stately dreams God lets us ride When we are innocent and young  Instead of dancing down my spring Oh I went grave and watchfully  They seemed so very great a thing My ways to Life and hers to me How good it is to go so free  To let all stars and sceptres fall For nothing matters now to me Who do not matter now at all  Miss Widdemer speaks many times of God and Heaven two words which do not appear often in modern poetry And her belief that He is so serviceable and so kind is in itself refreshing and an interesting contrast to the popular pagan cry Marion Strobel  ONE POET SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF  The Magpie s Shadow by Yvor Winters Musterbookhouse Chicago Yvor Winters is one of the rare American poets who  are active critically and whose theories are not laid by during the creative process With him art is sacrosanct therefore he says let us discover the nature of this art His first book The Immobile Wind was an inquiry and an answer The elementary thought what Croce calls   One Poet Speaks for Himself  the intuition forms unforms and re forms itself like protoplasm Ultimately it assumes a conclusive shape However no matter what the terms into which it has been translated the elementary thought will still be sensed as a nucleus Form is indigenous although certain formal habits may accrue Thus one finds in the same small book a poem as dry and sparse metrically as Hawk s Eye and another Death Goes Before Me transforming the English language by attention to harmony of vowel pitch into a medium as fluent as that employed by Verlaine The Magpie s Shadow is prefigured by lines like these from poems in The Immobile Wind  Far whispers creeping through an ancient shell  Life is in lichens That sleep as they run  And if men pass They pass like birds With necks craning aside  Stillness is like the beating of a drum  A disillusionment which knows science and discounts reality universalized through the emotions I have found Vico quoted as saying Metaphysics lifts itself above the universals the poetical faculty must plunge itself in particulars Yvor Winters does both forcing the first into coherence by means of the second  Of The Magpie s Shadow there is little to say It has violent friends and violent antagonists who argue viciously   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and futilely with I like and I don t like For myself when I find in twenty eight six syllable poems not only a complete seasonal cycle but such a cycle with both individual and universal implications I like Here is one of them No Being  I bent Thin nights receding  It is impossible to classify this poetry which is so new to us It is as fundamental and economical as a primitive I am thinking of certain Chippewa poems and at the same time with its surgically conscious introspective ness distinctly modern One might say impressionism one might say symbolism It includes both and more  Spring Rain My door frame smells of leaves Fields I did not pick a flower Alone I saw day s shadow strike  I should say Mr Winters speaks for himself  Pearl Andelson  TEACHER AND CRITIC  On English Poetry by Robert Graves Alfred A Knopf  There is an abundance of books which analyze poetry and of books which tell how to write poetry Since Poe however few poets have explained how they write Robert Graves does this and does it well He gives concrete examples from his own experience as a poet and   Teacher and Critic  discusses the subjective experiences which he holds are the bases of a number of well known poems not of his own composition  At the same time this is no mere textbook on the writing of verse The author treats of the fundamental subjective basis for poetry He adopts largely the theory of Dr Freud with which I believe most practicing poets will agree This in brief is his explanation  The poet consciously or unconsciously is always either taking in or giving out he hears observes weighs guesses condenses idealizes and the new ideas troop quietly into his mind until suddenly every now and again two of them violently quarrel and drag into the fight a group of other ideas that have been loitering about at the back of his mind for years There is great excitement noise and bloodshed with finally a reconciliation and drinks all around The poet writes a tactful police report on the affair and there is the poem  The book contains also comments on a wide variety of subjects related to poetry ranging from the poet s dress to details of cross rhythm and resolution The remarks are of varying merit the discussion of vers libre for example is inconsequential but Mr Graves makes no claim to utterance ex cathedra  This is one of the few works on English verse that possess any magic of style In this respect it deserves a place in the honorable succession represented by Sidney Shelley Poe and Eastman Indeed the style is one of the chief charms of the book The fanciful humor the aphoristic satire and the quiet whimsicality which are present in Mr Graves poems are evident to an even   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  greater extent in this prose volume Never does he commit the common fault of the critic taking himself too seriously Nelson Antrim Crawford  ASIA  Early Persian Poetry by A J Williams Jackson Mac  millan Co Selections from the Rubaiyat of Hafiz translated by a member of the Persia Society of London John Lane Chips of Jade and Betel Nuts translated by Arthur  Guiterman E P Dutton amp Co The Garden of Bright Waters and Colored Stars by Edward  Powys Mathers Houghton Mifflin Co  China and Japan their literature and their art have had of late a renascence within another renascence that of our own art and literature Discussions and imitations of Chinese and Japanese poetry have inundated the poetry magazines and publishers and some modern poets go so far as to tell the vers librists that they should all write like the Japanese of old or bosh to that effect Although the discussions and imitations bore us we stand in awe at the portentous spectacle that artistic Asia offers  This portentous spectacle would be made more magnificent by the advent of two little books by E Powys Mathers would be translations of folk songs and ancient and modern poems of Asia love songs mostly if there is an if if said poems and songs were actually of ancient and modern Asia and not as some scholars   Asia  assure us more or less faked But Mr Mathers is not just a faker he is a poet as the following whether a translation or not bears witness  I thought it was snowing Flowers but it was this young lady Coming towards me  These two books bearing such lovely titles are full of such poems as that Colored Stars being the shorter is the better book  A laudatory word should be due to every person who gives us a glimpse of the art of Asia But sometimes this glimpse is so perverted as in the case of the Hafiz selections and the translations we find in Early Persian Poetry that our thanks are given grudgingly if at all This member of the Persian Society of London translator of Hafiz his being unnamed is probably an apology ought to have had one good friend to tell him to keep his hands off Hafiz said friend would have proved a good friend of Hafiz also This turban and slippers ancient and venerable Turk who they assure us is as great as Dante is made up by the member of the Persia Society of London to look like the Sweet Singer of Michigan And all this because the translator has taken it upon himself to render in rhyme the Rubaiyat of Hafiz rhyme being one too many for him Possibly he would have done a better job had he undertaken to translate Hafiz literally and in prose The effort wasted in frantically fishing for the rhyme might have been turned to better   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  use in a search for the right word But who knows it might have turned out something like Mark Twain s translation of his own Jumping Frog from the French It s no use Mere scribblers ought to leave the poets of other nations alone they ought to let dead poets sleep the sleep of the just in their cool tombs Only a poet and a good one may translate adequately the work of another poet It is this fact that makes works of art of Fitzgerald s translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam Baudelaire s translations of Poe s tales etc  We make the same complaint concerning Chips of Jade and Betel Nuts except that the rhymed translations by Arthur Guiterman are graceful and attractive  Oh when the Whale lies floundering in the Shoal How all the Minnows laugh to see him roll But who knows whether the originals were merely graceful and pretty or sheer funny as some of these proverbs of China and India are Who knows how much of the spirit of majestic Hindu and Chinese proverbs how much of the mysticism of them was lost in this graceful and pretty handling which inevitably makes the proverbs petty and levels them all Early Persian Poetry is interesting as a book of history But if we must consider the translations included as fair examples of the work of these Persian poets we must perforce reach the conclusion that they are a race of drivellers and doggerel makers which cannot of course be true Emanuel Carnevali   NOTES  Mr Ezra Pound announces the formation of a group called the Bel Esprit to consist of thirty or more persons who will have the high privilege of contributing fifty dollars each a year toward the support of some literary artist in order that this artist may have enough leisure and freedom from care to devote himself to his art  The first beneficiary of the fund so contributed is to be T S Eliot whose work in Lloyd s Bank has been exhausting not only to his art but to his health as well A three months rest last winter was insufficient to restore him as anyone with jangled nerves would know and work in a bank is at best hardly conducive to intimate service of the muse  About ten more subscribers are needed in the Bel Esprit If any of POETRY S readers should care to join this group the editor will be glad to forward his name or money or both to the committee in charge It is understood but not precisely stated that the beneficiaries of the Bel Esprit are to be Americans as this country unlike
