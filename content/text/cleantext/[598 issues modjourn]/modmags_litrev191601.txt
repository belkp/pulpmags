and ebony moving out of the shadowand the silence that hangs there before the musician playsThere is nothing like it in the world nothing more wonderful There arerevolutionsgoing on in all the artsThe revolution in poetry is coming in for a lot of discussionso that even the layman is conscious of itHis feeling about it is that some effeminate beings called Imagists are trying to emasculate the noble art of poetryBut the thing is happening right under his nose and he is careful to keep postedin order to be able to defend his favorite theoryAs for the stagehe knows that Gordon Craig and Rhinehart have been using screens instead of marble pillars painted against red velvet curtainsIn painting he knows all about the cubists and futuristshe even knows that the donkey s tail story was something of a jokeIn sculpture he has heard of an unreasonable reaction from Rodinand he has probably seen Brzeska s head of Ezra PoundIn the ballet he has a rather clear idea of why the old classical form wouldn t serveperhaps because the Russians have demonstrated so clearly what it was they could do with the new formIn opera he thinks very little is happeningHe is rightBut the slowest revolution of all and the most interesting is that which is just beginning in the art of the pianoIt is the slowest because it is not the public alone that is bound to the old formThe masters themselves have not visioned toward a need that would make a new form inevitableThe need is a deeper musicAnd it is the most interesting because the convention that has bound the pianovirtuosityis a more worthy convention than that which has restricted any of the other artsThere is a universe of the arts in the pianoBut it is not a universe nowIt is a stuntThe piano has been used for stunts for years and years and yearsIt will go on being used that way for yearsWellI am the last one to deprecate the art of these stuntsI think they are beautifulsome of themI think they have their placeBut they have served it too wellI love them more than I love all the opals and rubies and sapphires and emeralds and topaz and amethyst and pearl a jeweller can dip his fingers into and spread out for your dazzled sensesBut I love poetry more than jewelsAnd I love music more than poetryIn the music of the piano you get the best illustration that music is a thing beginning and ending in itselfa thing not of story or image but of sounda thing that must be understood quite simply in its own termsas Hiram Kelly Moderwell puts ita thing that must be heard and not seenAnd in the revolution that is beginning you get this first pure principle combined with another that the music of the piano must reach to the passion of lifeThis is quite different from saying that music must be a dramatization of human lifeIt is merely saying that ballet dancing could never have produced an Isadora DuncanI imagine that Harold Bauer must have said something of this sort to himselfHe has certainly said it on the pianoHis attitude toward the piano has this sort of prophecy in itIt is a matter of the beauty of soundThe methods of approach of all themastershave been the sameThey have imposed something upon the pianoBut Bauer has approached the handling of the piano as Debussy approached composition or SchönbergWhen Schönberg wrote thatthe alleged tones believed to be foreign to harmony do not existthey are merely tones foreign to our accepted harmonic system and thattonality is not a hard and fast compulsion directing the course of music but a concept which makes it possible for us to give our ideas the requisite aspect of compactness he was saying practically what Bauer has suggested about the touching of the pianothat virtuosity is only a means to an endthat the springs of the art have been drying upand that until the musician can hear better he is not worthy of the sounds the piano has to give himYou can t play César Franck with the same hands you use for LizstYou must change your hands into differentfeelers The piano will give you the quality of almost every instrumentIt is as though Bauer had saidThey call this an instrument of percussionThey have laid down its limitationBut I doubt very much whether it will stay within that limitationI suspect it does not stop there but goes on into a realm where sound is of infinite development That is why you hear an organ when he plays César Franckthat is why you realize how the Imagists have worked when he plays Debussythat is why you get a sense of painting in all his musicBauer puts on the sound like paintHe knowsas Romain Rolland has saidthat every art tends to become a universe in itselfthat music becomes painting and poetrythat painting becomes musicetcAnd Bauer is not a geniusHe has merely suggested what will happen to the pianoand paved the way for an openness of mind about itHe has made a good many people gossip of how his scales won t compare with those of the other great ones but he has made a good many more suspect that there has been something lacking in the ultimatums of the piano athletesHe has done many simple and dynamic things to bring the piano into its ownBut the full achievement of this will go beyond what has been heard yet anywhere and the man who does it will be scorned as the greatest fool or madman of his time before it is fully understoodIt doesn t matterThe thing will happen I hardly know howI hardly even know words with which to tell what it will be likeIt can only be told on the pianoIn his Spiritual Adventures Arthur Symons has a story of a musician who says more true things about the piano than I have ever found anywhere elseOne of them is this Most modern music is a beggar for pityThe musician tries to show us how he has suffered and how hopeless he isHe sets his toothache and his heartache to musicputting those sufferings into the music without remembering that sounds have their own agonies which alone they can express in a perfect manner This is where thelions and panthers of the pianohave failed mostthey have not loved the sounds enoughThey have not allowed each sound its full lifeThis is the real reason why the piano has stopped short of itselfThey might almost as well have played bellsYou can strike bells which will bring out any number of tunesloud or softwith every possible variety of phrasingBut your interest will be in the tune rather than in the soundYou can t limit the piano to the tunes that can be played upon itYou don t treat a violin that waynor an organAnd of course you can register a piano almost as fully as an organ with thestopsthat are in the ends of your fingersHow fascinating it isand how wonderful But most piano recitals are like recitations or some sort of performance on a school platformTheir beauty ends with the beauty of stylephrasingfinishtonetasteIt is diction rather than musicIt is scienceBusoni is not a prophethe is an orchestraHofmann loves style more than he does soundGodowsky loves patterns more than soundGabrilowitsch loves delicate sounds intenselybut has no feeling for the sounds of great chordsZeisler loves rhythm more than soundAnd so onPaderewski loves the pianoHe is geniuspure and simple though of course there is nothing less pure or simpleHe may do what he likes break sounds into bitscrack them like nutsIt doesn t matterHe never fails to communicate a mood to the instrument the mood of his personal equationAnd that is art Przybyszewski playing Chopinthat would also be artWhat have the excellent piano concerts you hear to do with artwith inspiration Piano playing is certainly something to be surpassedMusic is the thing And that means ecstasymadnessdivinitythe beauty upon which all the ends of the world are comeThe design of sound Each sound that comes out of the piano is something alive And now for the interesting partWhen I talk of thenew musicwhich will be different from Debussy and Schönberg and all the rest of them I am not talking of how far beyond the limits of known harmonyor the anarchy which disregards any harmonic systemwe shall goUndoubtedlyas far as all that is concerned some day some one will dig down to the roots and turn up music as it is before it is tamed to the scale This seems to me a settled factBut I am much more interested in the piano itself and the deliverer who is to set it free from the lie which has grown up around it and make it vibrate to a truer colorIt is all in the plane of vibrationI believeIt will come about in three ways through the mechanical development of the pianothrough a new type of musicand chiefly through the new type of pianistYou will have your Mason and Hamlinthis is not advertisingit is merely a convictionyou will have that great dark winged victory standing alone on a stage you will care a great deal about the color of the light around and above it the tones of the walls within which your beautiful sounds are to liveyou will touch that ivory and ebony ohthere are no wordsYou will see those sounds against the colorYou may write a program for your audience something like thisI believe the right technical approach is simply a different are the most beautiful there are anywhere in the world more beautiful than the wind in trees or the moan in the sea or the silence that is heard on desertsI believe that these sounds live only by a certain magic of invocationThere are no rules for them unless perhaps you want to read BergsonI believe the right technical approach is simply a different kind of friendship or love affair with each soundI believe that tone goes way beyond the range between pianissimo and fortissimobetween legato and staccatoetcTone is radianceeagernesslightdarknessdevastationsomething that meltssomething that cries and burnssomething that shattersI do not believe in playingprogramsending with a blaze of LizstI couldn t play the Campanella to save my lifebut I don t see that it mattersI do not believe inprogrammusic beginning with Bachnow that the public has learned to applaud himand ending with LisztI couldn t play the Campenella to save my lifebut I don t see that it mattersI do not believe in nature music babbling brooks and warbling birdsI believe in nature moodjust as I do in the mood of all great phenomenaThe music I have made will be sometimes merely the curve of a mood like the curve of line in Watts s Orpheus and Eurydiceor merely the design of a color or a scentBut always it will keep close to two fundamentals thathard gemlike flameand the rhythm of sexAll this will come under the classification of those things which are so worth knowing that they can never be taughtIt will belong to that individual who can say the new word his own wordIt will make the piano something we have scarcely dreamed ofIt will make up an art that has nothing to do with the four walls of a roomIt could not be set toQuestions and Answersin The LadiesHome JournalIt will have little to do with accomplishmentbut everything to do with that

sybariticizing with thirteen beautiful little volumes of Oscar Wilderecently published by GPPutnam s SonsIt is a usefulalthough often painfulordeal ventilating the store room of your old godsThere was a time when I worshipped Wilde unqualifiedlyAs a freshman I wrote a pathetic paper in which I demanded the canonization of the author of De ProfundusAlasI have come to discern spots on the sunAs a decorative artist Wilde has no flawsThe perfect design applied in his multifarious productions makes one compare him to the titans of the High Renaissance Nihil tetigit quod non ornavitThe graceful form justifies even his obvious moral fairy taleseven his unoriginalKeats esque and Poe esque poemsIt is for the style that we accept his De Profundisthat insincerest attempt for sincerityBut Wilde strove for more than mere external artistic effectIn his critical essays he lifted the critic to the heights of coand re creationand instructed him to demand from a work of art eternal values The critic rejects those obvious modes of art that have but one message to deliver and having delivered it become dumb and sterileand seeks rather for such modes as suggest reveries and moods and by their imaginative beauty make all interpretations true and no interpretation final Wehis disciples in aesthetic valuationscome to our master with his own criterionand find him on more than one occasion grievously wanting in the requirements that he had set up for the artistHe either has no message to deliveras in his clever playsor he delivers his message in such an outspoken way that no field is left for suggestion or imaginative interpretationHe had transgressed Mallarmé s maxim To name is to kill to suggest is to createnot only in The Ballad of Reading Gaolthe work that belongs to the crushedsemi penitent Wildehe committed this unpardonable sin in his masterpieceSaloméThat wonderful harmonious ghastlinesswoven out of moods and motivessurcharged with suggestive tragedy and fatalismsuddenly breaks into a criminal vulgarity through the introduction of arealdead headwhich drives away illusion and atmosphereand strikes your nostrils with the odor of theatrical grease paintThe rehabilitation of Oscar Wilde was imposed upon the Anglo Saxon world by the continentespecially by Germanythe expropriator of English geniuseswhere the production of Wilde s plays has rivalled in frequency those of ShakespeareI know of a German pundit who chose as a topic for his doctor s dissertationsThe Influence of Pater on Oscar Wilde But continental depreciation is as fast as Anglo Saxon appreciation is slowNeue Zeitenneue Vögel neue Vögelneue LiederEuropean literature in recent decades has had more meteors than starsWilde s flash is rapidly vanishingYou may call me a Cassandrabut I venture a prophecy that soon Wilde will find his peaceful place in American colleges alongside with AustenEliotMeredithetcSalome will always remain one of the world s great symphoniesa symphony in which the motive of doom rends your soul from the first sound to the lastPoems in Prose will never lose their charm as ivory carved bits of ideal conversation the art in which Wilde was supremethe art that is almost unknown in this country where it is substituted by talkHis other works are doomed to be time s victimsNot because they are worthlessbut for the reason of their adaptabilityOne must be a propheta Nietzschewho hurls his seeds over many generationsin order to endureWilde was aware of this dangerand he wished to be misunderstoodbut he lacked the profundity for such a meritHe did not mirror his age but he had realized the potentialities of his agehad popularized them to such a degree that they have become the possession of the crowdWe are not any longer dazzled by the clever witticisms in his Plays they have become almost commonplaceEven the gracefulradiating Intentions appear to us somewhat obviousWhyIt is the pathos of proximity Wilde s paradoxesmotstheorieshave proven so appropriateadaptableand digestible for our agethat it took only one decade to absorb them into our blood and marrowCleverism for the sake of cleverism has come to be an epidemic in our days cleverists find Wilde an inexhaustible source for parasitic exploitationOur Hunekersand under this appellative I have in mind the legions of our omniscient boulevardiers criticsdon a Wildesque robeand have little trouble in passing as genuine before the good natured publicUnfortunately the constitution of the Hunekers is too weak to absorb Wilde s big truths they prefer the digestible chaffAdaptability spells forgetabilityCrime and punishment Solitude DAVID O NEIL Youththere be madness your soulto the mountain solitudes you can grow up your madness The Novelist SHERWOOD ANDERSON THE novelist is about to begin the writing of a novelFor a year he will be at the task and what a year he will haveHe is going to write the story of Virginia Bordendaughter of Fan Bordena Missouri river raftsmanThere in his little room he sitsa smallhunched up figure with a pencil in his handHe has never learned to run a type writer and so he will write the words slowly and painfullyone after another on the white paperWhat a multitude of words For hours he will sit perfectly stillwriting madly and throwing the sheets aboutThat is a happy timeThe madness has possession of himPeople will come in at the door and sit abouttalking and laughingSometimes he jumps out of his chair and walks up and downHe lights and relights his pipeOvercome with weariness he goes forth to walkWhen he walks he carries a heavy walking stick and goes muttering alongThe novelist tries to shake off his madness but he does not succeedIn a store he buys cheap writing tablets andsitting on a stone near where some men are building a housebegins again to writeHe talks aloud and occasionally fingers a lock of hair that falls down over his eyesHe lets his pipe go out and relights it nervouslyDays passIt is raining and again the novelist works in his roomAfter a long evening he throws all he has written awayWhat is the secret of the madness of the writerHe is a small man and has a torn earA part of his ear has been carried away by the explosion of a gunAbove the ear there is a spotas large as a child s handwhere no hair growsThe novelist is a clerk in a store in Wabash Avenue in ChicagoWhen he was a quite young man he began to clerk in the store and for a time promised to be successfulHe sold goodsand there was something in his smile that won its way into all heartsHow he liked the people who came into the store and how the people liked himIn the store now the novelist does not promise to be successfulThere is a kind of conspiracy in the storeAlthough he tries earnestly he continues to make mistakes and all of his fellows conspire to forgive and conceal his mistakesSometimes when he has muddled things badly they are impatient and the manager of the storea hugefat fellow with thin grey hairtakes him into a room and begins to scoldThe two men sit by a window and look down into Wabash AvenueIt is snowing and people hurry along with bowed headsSo much do the novelist and the fat grey haired man like each other that the scolding does not lastThey begin to talk and the hours passPresently it is time to close the store for the night and the two go down a flight of stairs to the streetOn the corner stands the novelist and the store managerstill talkingPresently they go together to dineThe manager of the store looks at his watch and it is eight o clockHe remembers a dinner engagement with his wife and hurries awayOn the street car he blames himself for his carelessness I should not have tried to reprimand the fellow he saysand laughsIt is night and the novelist works in his roomThe night is cold and he opens a windowThere isin his closeta torn woolen jacket given him by a friendand he wraps the jacket about himIt has stopped snowing and the stars are in the skyThe talk with the store manager has inflamed the mind of the novelistAgain he writes furiouslyWhat he is now writing will not fit into the life story of Virginia Borden butfor the momenthe thinks that it will and he is happyTomorrow he will throw all awaybut that will not destroy his happinessWho is this Virginia Borden of whom the novelist writes and why does he write of herHe does not know that he will get money for his story and he is growing oldWhat a foolish affairPresently there may be a new manager in the store and the novelist will lose his placeOnce in a while he thinks of that and then he smilesThe novelist is not to be won from his purposeVirginia Borden is a woman who lived in ChicagoThe novelist has seen and talked with herLike the store manager she forgot herself talking to himShe forgot the torn ear and the bald spot where no hair grew and the skin was snow whiteTo talk with the novelist was like talking aloud to herselfIt was delightfulFor a year she knew him and then went away to live with a brother in Colorado where she was thrown from a horse and killedWhen she lived in Chicago many people knew Virginia BordenThey saw her going here and there in the streetsOnce she was married to a man who was leader of an orchestra in a theater but the marriage was not a successNothing that Virginia Borden did in the city was successfulThe novelist is to write the life story of Virginia BordenAs he begins the task a great humbleness comes over himTears come into his eyesHe is afraid and tremblesIn the woman who talked and talked with him the novelist has seen many strangebeautifulunexpected little turns of mindHe knows that in Virginia Borden there was spirit thatbut for the muddle of lifemight have become a great flameIt is the dream of the novelist that he will make men understand the spirit of the woman they saw in the streetsHe wants to tell the store manager of her and the little wiry man who has a desk next to his ownIn the Wabash Avenue store there is a woman who sits on a high stool with her back to the novelistHe wants to tell her of Virginia Bordento make her see the reality of the woman who failedto make all see that such a woman once lived and went about among the women of ChicagoAs the novelist writes events grow in his mindHis mind is forever active and he is continually making up stories about himselfAs the Virginia Borden whom men saw was a caricature of the Virginia Borden who lived in the mind of the novelistso he knows that he is himself but a shadow of something very realAnd so the novelist puts himself into the bookIn the book he is a largesquare shouldered man with tiny eyesHe is one who came to Chicago from a village in Poland and was leader of an orchestra in a theatreAs the orchestra leader the novelist married Virginia Borden and lived in a house with herYou see the novelist wants to explain himself alsoHe is a lover and so vividly does he love that he has the courage to love even himselfAnd so it is the lover that sits writing and the madness of the writer is the madness of the loverAs he writes he is making loveSurely all can understand thatBecause sexual love is the most useful and common type of excitement we are apt to think it necessary to lifewhen the truth is that it is excitement itself which is life s essential Rebecca West

FSFLINT AM Y LOWELL has sent me her bookSix French Poets who areEmile VerhaerenAlbert SamainRemy de GourmontHenri de RégnierFrancis Jammesand Paul Fort and it occurs to me that I must be her severest critic are we not rivalsWhenin the summer of 1914before the war was dreamed ofshe told me over her dinner table of her intention to write this book and of the names of the poets she had chosenI objected to SamainSamainI saidwas exquisitebut not importantand he could only be read a few pages at a time without wearinessStuart Merrill and Francis Vielé GriffinI went onare both more considerable poets and both are Americans and since you insist on including Remy de Gourmont as one of your poetsyou might increase your number to sevenin many ways an appropriate number where poets are concerned and so onBut she only motioned the waiter to fill my glass with champagneand what can a man do against such argument and such a willAnd noweven if I wished to damn her bookI do not she will have already heaped coals of fire upon my head in her prefacewhere she says kind things about me because I happened to mention the names of one or two books to herinformation she did not really needMiss Lowell states that she hasmade no attempt at an exhaustive critical analysis of the various worksof her poets RatherI have tried to suggest certain things which appear to the trained poet while reading themThe pages and pages of hair splitting criticism turned out by erudite gentlemen for their own amusement has been no part of my schemeBut I think the studentthe poet seeking new inspirationthe reader endeavoring to understand another poetic idiomwill find what they need to set them on their way That is so this book contains six causeries in which Miss Lowell tells you why she loves these poetsand what she loves about theminterrupting her talk every now and then to read some poem to you which illustrates her meaningintroducing every now and then a fragment of biography to correspond with the stage of the poet s work to which she has brought youor stopping every now and then to pick out rare phrases and rare music of words for your especial delightNo oneI supposewill have listened to Miss Lowell s causerie in so happy a setting as the sitting Six French Poetsby Amy LowellNew YorkMacmillan Companyroom on the third floor of a hotel in Piccadilly in which she talked to us in the August of 1914Through the long French window open in the corner could be seen the length of Piccadillyits great electric globesits shining roadwayandon the leftthe tops of the trees of Green Parkdark grey in the moonlightthe noise of the motorbusses and of the taxis reached us in a muted murmurand at the corner of the park oppositebeneath a street lampstood a newsboywhose headlines we strained our eyes from time to time to catchIt was in this tenseness created by the expectation of news that Miss Lowell read Paul Fort and Henri de Régnier to usshe reads French beautifullyand it is the emotion of those eveningsmore than anything elsethat her book brings back to meThis is not criticismI knowbut I am a critic displumedI have quoted Miss Lowell s statement of her aimslet me now give my impression of what she has doneYou can take up her bookand read it from beginning to end without weariness or boredomyou will be continually interestedcontinually delightedcontinually movedMiss Lowell s method of quoting whole poems and long poems as well as detached and beautiful fragments has filled her book with an emotional content that almost makes me afraid to open itthe fear of too much beautyAndfinallyshe has flattered the sense of personal superiority in us all by allowing little slips to remain where we may find themand preen ourselves on our clevernessWhen you have absorbed all these sensationsyou will have come to Appendix Awhich is 140 pages of the finest translations into English that exist of the six poets in questionorit might truly be saidof the French poets of the symbolist generationIn these translationsMiss Lowell has rarely been tempted away from proseand you have only to compare her work with the work of other translators to be immediately aware of how much she has gained by her prudenceher artistry had better be saidThat Miss Lowell had all the equipment for a task of this kindher own two books of poems left no doubt at allIn them you will find the same delight in beautiful word and phrase which has undoubtedly led her to modern French poetry as to a friendly countryand to the achievement in these translationsIf she had done nothing more than just publish theseshe would have earned our gratitudebut she offers them to you as the least of her bookas an appendixafter you have been amusedinterestedinstructed and movedI can conceive of no greater pleasure my pleasure in the book is of a different kind than that of the lover of poetry who reads in Miss Lowell s book about modern French poetry for the first time it must be like falling into El DoradoI should add that the book contains an excellent signed photograph of each poet The Picnic MARJORIE SEIFFERT Here they come in pairscarrying basketsPale clerks with

the State and of the Prussiansa sick mana great artist in words to be read with delight and your tongue in your cheek This is from John Galsworthy sSecond Thoughts on this Warin the January Scribner sAnd so it goes onhe identifies Nietzsche with the new German philosophywhich the poor man would have hated as he did Prussianism he talks of the Will to Power and the Will to Love as two forces at opposite polesquite in the manner of the Chestertons and he derides Shaw s clear headed understanding that there is no real struggle of ideals involved in the war as the statement of a brilliant intellect withno flairno feelersnone of that instinctive perception of the essence and atmosphere of things which is a so much surer guide than reason These things are heart breakingIf the artists can

promised to try itPSSince writing the above something has happened which my brain still refuses to believeI have just been told that MrKnopf has pleadedguiltyto this asinine chargein order to avoid the expense and the publicityand that Homo Sapiens will no longer be circulated in this countryIf it is true it is the most inexcusably ridiculous thing that has happened for many monthsIt is incredibleThe World s Worst FailureREBECCA WEST S brilliant articles in The New RepublicMargaret Sanger and the Issue of Birth Control makes me so positively ill as the average radicalThe average

Manyradicalshave advised MrsSanger that the wisest thing to do is to plead guilty to thisobscenitycharge and to throw herself upon the mercy of the court which would mean that she could get off with a

significance of formAlasthis theory is obsoleteColor itself should become formproclaims MrWrightand he quotes the manifesto of his beloved SynchromistsIn our painting color becomes the generating functionPainting being the art of colorany quality of a picture not expressed by color is not painting With a sigh of relief we reach the chapter on SynchromismAll art up to the year 1912 has been nothing but preliminary experimentationIn Rubens were consummated the aims of the old paintersbeginning with the fifteenth centurythe Primitives are dismissed as not deserving

themoralfrom the sordid panorama that is revealed before himthat malodorous dunghill swarming with human beingswhose crawling and writhing is called lifeThe book should have been much shorterthe super abundance of details makes it Dreiserian or BennetianAnd here I should like to touch upon a sore which reviewers customarily do not discussfor fear of mauvais tonWhy are the English translations so careless and comical The book in question is full of such glaring errorssuch nonsensical misunderstandingssuch atrocious ignorancethat it has made me pull my hair in despair of solving the dilemma whether I should laugh at the comicalness or whether I should rage at the impertinenceI am quite sure that the translatorhis name is not revealedknows as much Russian as Percy Pinkertonthe crucifier

could never quite tell themThe supreme virtue of Ben Hechf sDregsis that he could tell themThat is the artOf course I have nothing to say to those people who deplore MrHecht s subject matter and urge

my ability MrO Brien s rather vague reference to and nebulous listings of the stories to be published in his anthologyThe Best Stories of 1915 and Year Book of American FictionI can but come to the startled conclusion that Ben Hecht s three stories are all to be reprinted in the estimable collectionGood for Ben HechtTHE LITTLE REVIEWand MrO Brien s catholicity of judgmentSome of us there are who

Forbids negative as literature If he had found it bad architecture or mediocre sculpture I should have been less pleasedPlay makingto my mindis not a form of literatureeven though its medium chances to be wordsbut it is an art of spacing focusing buildingStructure upon structure FoundationOrnamentDesignAn art as distinct from other forms of word utility as color medium is from plastic artDrama is related to literature only in so far as all arts are inter relatedNo more than thisBy drama I meanof courseplays intendedat least in the writer s mindfor productionThese alone are playsFor one reason or another they may never reach the boardsbut they must have lived in the writer s fantasy as things producedDesk drawer dramas are not playsI believe that the hope of the modern drama lies in the artist who can learn to look upon himself as a builder a maker and not a writer of playsAnd so again I thank your critic whose charity has made me feel that I am on the road which leads toSomewhere

veiled in amethystThe trees spread grateful branches Above a smiling sodFor thirsting slakedfor hunger fedAll things are praising GodHuntly CarterLondonThe letter by CSmith of Chicagoin the October issue of THE LITTLE REVIEWis so phenomenally stupid and so intellectually dishonest that it is almost beneath noticeIf I consent to notice itI do so in order to warn Smithsonian understudies that they will be severely dealt with if they attempt to repeat Smith s brazen offence of writing to a significant journal and cooly suggesting that a single and relatively unimportant wrong attribution is to be regarded as a fair and honest sample of the whole subject matter of an article occupying several pages and mainly devoted to a metaphysical explanation of the origin and nature of poetryFurthermoresuggesting that I am applying to a poetBrowninga rigid test of poetryseeking to prove his words poetically good or bad by my poetical experiencewhen as a matter of fact I am offering certain wordssome of which are wrongly attributed to Browningas indisputable evidence that in venting the emotions versifiers find descriptive figures efficaciousNo doubt some of the words flaunted by Smith are wrongly attributed to BrowningThey are so wrongly attributed that anyone can see they are wrongly attributedAnd anysaneintelligent and decently responsible man to use Smith s yellow press tautologywould have given me an opportunity of saying they are wrongly attributed before venturing to put on silly airs of hypercriticismThen he would have learnt that the first and third line of the quotation belong oddly enoughto another piece of 33 The Little Review poetryand have got mixed up with Browning s stuff in some unaccountable way have not the least idea how the mix took placeAll I know is that my article was finished off in great haste to catch the mailIt was sent in handscript and not typescriptAnd there was no time to send me a proof otherwise the quotation would certainly have been correctedand the many errors which now appear in my article would have disappearedI feel I am justified in saying it was not my intention to send the words which have crept into print by the discovery that I have actually written down Browning s very wordsHere is BrowningAnd the sun looked over the mountain s rimstraight was a path of gold for himthe need of a world of men for me The first line of the verse is missingThe three lines however serve the purpose of my comparisonI had also set down these lines by BrowningOne lyric woman in her crocus vestWoven of sea woolsI intended to include this with my quotationsFor here in my view is a figure as original and precisely felicitous as anything the Imagists have given usThat this dragging in of some wrongly attributed words so obviously wrong as to deceive no one for the sole purpose of discrediting an important article is dishonestis clear from the fact that Smith does not drag in any other quotation from the many givennor produce any other evidence whatsoever in support of his contention that my article is inept and careless throughoutIn fact he has nothing more damaging to offer than his own fatuous statement that he happensto consider my article an ill digested congeries of vague views whichwhen one comes to examine it is found to contain a baseless assertion and a clear admission that my article is above and beyond Smith s headAs to the silliness of Smith s letterthis may be judged from the followingSmith begins with the generalization that magazines diewhose pages are as a rule carelessinconsidered and inept note the repetition and consequent lack of thoroughness The publications of the capitalist press answer this descriptionThe news sheetsfor instanceare rotten with carelessnessinconsiderednes and ineptnessThey would be rottener if they couldYet they do not dieOn the contrary they sell by the millionIf sothen THE LITTLE REVIEW should sell by the millionBut Smith says it will dieAnd Smith is a carefulserviceableand accurate manBy way of comparison Smith relieves himself of this matchless composition Your magazine will dieas a steam engine would grow useless in which no direction towards any cylinder was given to the indubitable forces generated in the boiler What is the precise meaning of this bombastic twaddleIn homely wordsit means that a steam engine isnotwould grow useless when the steam power developed in its boiler is not utilised in any cylinderAnyone who examines this analogy will agree with me that Smith is a carefulserviceableand accurate manFrom the general Smith comes to the particular and quotes what he is pleased to call an example of myineptitude and carelessnessas an example of the generalineptitude and carelessnessof THE LITTLE REVIEWWithout knowing anything as to the circumstances under which the wrongly attributed words found their way into printwithout stopping to inquire to what extent I contributed to the mistakeand upon no other evidence whatsoever than the said wrongly attributed wordshe proceeds to saddle me with the astounding intentionto obliterate all sense of accuracyall love of clear and rational communicationall fidelity to honest statementand all interest in truth which makes four ways of uttering the same inverifiable statement Finally Smith challenges the editor of THE LITTLE REVIEW to print his ghastly ineptitudeShe has taken the short way and done soIt serves Smith right34 The Little Review MSilvermanChicagoYour last issue is a failure with two exceptionsMiss Goldman s article onPreparednessand MrHecht s letterBoth

before the unknown beauty of itthinking Oddbut no doubt it s all right Alsoto my untutored mindthe frequent use of profanity in an everydayconversational way in two or three of the articles is amusingand makes me wonderIt reminds me of the days when I first took up the artand used to feel a shudder of delight when I ripped out a goodmouth filling Damn it all to hellPerhaps it has lost its charm for me as a literary ornament because I swear so much myselfjust as a matter of habit without deriving the oldtime pleasure from itOther places where these boys put it all over me are in music
