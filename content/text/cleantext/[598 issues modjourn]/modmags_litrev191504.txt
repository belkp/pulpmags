Resourceful PoliceMARGARET CANDERSONI want to write about so many things this time that I don t know where to beginAt first I had planned to do five or six pages on the crime of musical criticism in this country particularly as focused in the critcisantics with Scriabin s beautiful Prometheus recently played by the Chicago SymphonyTruly that was an opportunity for the American music critic He could be as righteously bourgeois as he wished and his readers would credit him withsanityand a clear vision or he could be as ignorantly facetious as he wished and increase his reputation for witIt didn t occur to him that there might be something wrong with his imagination rather than with Scriabin s artHow exciting it would be to find a music critic whose auditory nerves were as sensitive as his visual or gustatory nerves Surely it s not asking too much of people engaged in the business of sound that they be able not only to listen but to hearWell there were many other matters I wanted towrite ofFor instancethe absurdity of our music schools the pest of writers who begin their sentencesButhoweverthe so far unnoticed strength of Saninthe fault with George Middleton s Criminalsthe antics of the Drama Leaguethe stunning things in The Egoistexaggeration as a possible basis of artthe supremacy of Form the undefinable standard of those of us who hate standardizationsetc etcBut for the moment I have found something more important to talk about MrAnthony ComstockOf course there is nothing new to say about him and nothing awful enoughThe best thing I ve heard lately is this Anthony Comstock not only doesn t know anythingbut he doesn t suspect anything Francis Hackett can write about Billy Sunday and resist the temptation of invectivePerhaps he s too much an artist to feel the temptationI wonder if he could do the same about Anthony ComstockCertainly I can tEven the thought of Billy Sunday s mammoth sentimentalizations and the 35 135 people whoaccording to the last reportshad been soothed therebyfills me with shudders of hopelessness for the eventual education of menAnd the thought of Anthony Comstock is ten times more horribleHis latest outrage is well known by this time his arrest of William Sanger for giving to a Comstock detective a copy of MrsSanger s pamphletFamily LimitationThe charge wascirculating obscene literature I have seen that pamphletread it carefullyand given it to all the people I know well enough to be sure they are not Comstock detectivesThere is not an obscene word in itnaturallyMargaret Sanger couldn t be obscene she s a gentleseriouswell informed woman writing in a way that any high minded physician mightI have The Little Review 3 also seen her pamphlet called English Methods of Birth Controlwhich practically duplicates the leafletHygienic Methods of Family Limitationadopted by the Malthusian League of England and is sentto all persons married or about to be marriedwho apply for itin all countries of the worldexcept to applicants from the United States of Americawhere the Postal Laws will not allow of its delivery These pamphlets tell in simple language all the known methods for the prevention of conception methods practised everywhere by the educated and the rich and unknown only to the poor and the ignorant who need such knowledge mostMrsSanger says in her preface Todayin nearly all countries of the worldmost educated people practise some method of limiting their offspringEducated people are usually able to discuss at leisure the question of contraceptives with the professional men and women of their classand benefit by the knowledge which science has advancedThe information which this class obtains is usually clean and harmlessIn these same countrieshoweverthere is a larger number of people who are kept in ignorance of this knowledge it is said by physicians who work among these people that as soon as a woman rises out of the lowest stages of ignorance and povertyher first step is to seek information of some practical means to limit her familyEverywhere the woman of this class seeks for knowledge on this subjectSeldom can she find itbecause the medical profession refuses to give itand because she comes in daily contact with those only who are as ignorant as herself of the subjectThe consequence isshe must accept the stray bits of information given by neighborsrelativesand friendsgathered from sources wholly unreliable and uninformedShe is forced to try everything and take anythingwith the result that quackery thrives on her innocence and ignorance is perpetuated The result of this propaganda was Margaret Sanger s arrest last fallI ve forgotten the various steps by whichthat blindheavystupid thing we call governmentcame to its lumbering decision that she ought to spend ten or fifteen years in jail for her efforts to spread this knowledgeBut MrsSanger left the country thank heavenHoweverI understand that when she has finished her work of making these pamphlets known she means to come back and face the imprisonmentI pray she doesn t mean anything of the kindWhy should she go to jail for ten years because we haven t suppressed Anthony ComstockLast year his literary supervision was given its first serious jolt when Mitchel Kennerley won the Hager Revely suitBut that was not nearly so important as the present issuebecause Hagar Revely was rather negative literature and birth control is one of the milestones by which civilization will measure its progressThe science of eugenics has always seemed to me fundamentally a sentimentalization something that a man might have conceived in the frame of mind Stevenson was in when he wrote OlallaBecause there is no such thingreallyas the scientific restriction of love and

APPEARED IN The Masses The MassesBY THE WAYIS ONE OF THE MAGAZINES INDISPENSABLE TO THE LIVING OF AN INTELLIGENT LIFE THE STORY IS CALLEDPUTTING ONE OVER ON WOODS When Commissioner Woods took office as head of the New York police force a year agohe brought with him some enlightened ideas about the relation of the police to the publicA week before a meeting had been held at Union Square which by police interference had been turned into a bloody riotA week later another Union Square meeting took placewith the police under orders tolet them talk The meeting passed off peaceablyThus the enlightened views of the new commissioner of police were vindicatedThe right of free speechand of free opinionwas conceded as not being A menace to civilizationThe Little Reviexu 5 But a police force which is enabled to exist and enjoy its peculiar privileges by virtue of protecting the public against imaginary dangerscould not see its position undermined in this wayIt was necessary to persuade the public that SocialistsAnarchistsand IWWs were plotting murder and destructionThe public was prone to accept this melodramatic viewbut Commissioner Woodsbeing an intelligent manwas inclined to be cynicalSo it became necessary toput one over on Woods They framed it up in the regular police fashionA clever young Italian detective named Pulignanoit appears from the evidencewas promised a raise of salary and a medal if he would engineer a bomb plotPulignano got hold of two Italian boys not anarchists or socialistsbut religious fanatics and urged them on to blow up StPatrick s CathedralHe planned the deedbought the materials of destruction for themand shamed them when they wanted to pull out of the plot the night beforeThe next morningat great risk to an innocent publicthe bomb was carried into the cathedrallightedand then the dozens of policemen and detectivesdisguised as scrubwomenetc rushed in to save civilizationAnd Woods fell for itHe swallowed the whole sensational businessThey have got himHe is their dupeand henceforth their faithful toolReaction is in the saddle All radicals to be expelled from the city says a headlineA card catalogue of IWWsympathizersSocialism under the official banFree speech doomedSo they hopeAt the least it means that the fight has for the lovers of liberty begun againBut one wonders a little about Arthur WoodsHe is on their side now the apologist of as infamous and criminal an agent provocateur as ever sent a foolish boy to the gallowsBut will Woods fail to see how he has been used by the police in this latest attempt to crush freedom in the interest of a privileged groupIs he as much a fool as they thinkGiovannitti s Italian magazine77 Fuocostates that the bomb was made of caps and gravel the kind of thing children use on the fourth of JulyI know that Mother Earth has started a fund to prevent the two boys from being railroadedWill there never be an end of these ghastly things As too much light

preserve me from saying MFort is vulgarbut if to hate pomposity and moral pretentiousness be vulgarthen let us be vulgaras MFort isBetter be obscene than a ninnyThose who have not read MFort s work and who suspect from the foregoing quotations that he is really a prose writer impudently palming off his productions assweet poesy are asked to read the following poem with attentionLA RONDE Si toutes les filles du monde voulaient sdonner la maintout autour de la mer elles pourraient faire une rondeSi tous les gars du monde voulaient bien êtrmarinsils fraient aves leurs barques un joli pont sur l ondeAlors on pourrait faire une ronde autour du mondesi tous les gens du monde voulaient sdonner la main That is saidI don t know with what truthto be the most popular of MFort s poemsIt certainly wasI am toldin everybody s mouth in Paris when it was first published rather as Dolores was in London in the sixtiesThe cadence of the poem isof courseobvious and markedas it should be in achanson It is rather a good poem to start onas MFort s way of printing rhymed and accented verse as prose is there forcibly exemplifiedMFort has not abandoned the Alexandrinebut he is not its slaveConfident in his theory that most poetry is a matter of typography he writes rhymed alexandrinesrhymed vers libres and rhymed and unrhymed prose in exactly the same mannerthe effect is curious and charmingIt is of course not the very commonplace device of daily newspapers when they want to be funnybut a genuine artistic principleThe effect is very different from that received from a perusal of tedious quatrains written as prose in the latter case one is disgusted immediatelyknowing that no mannot even a paid journalistis such a fool as to write such stuff in prosein MFort s case the typographical arrangement prevents the ear becoming fatigued with the stressed rhymes of linear verse and at the same time gives a richness to the apparent prose that no real prose possesses For

descriptionIt is better than Hugo s descriptions in Notre Dame de Parischiefly because it is more natural and familiarIn this little article I have barely touched the rim of Paul Fort s workHe is

THROUGHOUT THE PAST CENTURYAND TO A GREAT EXTENT THIS HOLDS TRUE TO OUR VERY DAYREVOLUTIONISMTERRORISMSOCIALISMHAVE BEEN PROPAGATED THROUGH THE MOUTHS OF NOVEL HEROES AND HEROINES FOR THE ARDENT EMULATION OF THE SEEKING SUSCEPTIBLE YOUTH THE FUROR PRODUCED INRUSSIA BY THE APPEARANCE OF ARTZIBASHEV S Sanin SOME EIGHT YEARS AGO HAS HAD NO PARALLEL EVEN IN THAT COUNTRYWHERE A NEW WORD IN BELLES LETTRES HAS ALWAYS TAKEN ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A NATIONAL EVENTTHE IMPORTANCE OF THIS NOVEL IS PARTLY DUE TO CHRONOLOGICAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE FACT THAT IT CAME AS A LURING WILL OTHE WISP IN THE POSTREVOLUTIONARY GLOOM OFRUSSIAN LIFETHE YOUNG GENERATION WAS ON THE VERGEof despondency the collapse of the Revolution brought to nought the long strugglethe thousands of sacrificed livesthe high aspirationsthe Constitutionwhich had been the ideal of generationsthe religion of all pure minded Russiahad degenerated into a mocking buffonadethe subservient DumaAt such a time Artzibashev steps forward offering the disillusioned youth a new type the strongsane Saninwho derides the altruistic strivings of his compatriots and advocates simple animalistic lifesans principlessans standardswith the sole aim of satisfying one s impulsesSo strong and timely was the appeal that it immediately created a large following clubs and societies were formed for the promulgation of the new religionSanin s ideas were hotly discussed from the lecture platform and in the press in shortsuch a formidable movement burst forth that the governmentwhich has usually welcomed any sign of deviation from revolutionary thoughtbecame alarmed and withdrew the book from circulationBut the importance of Sanin has been far more than localIn Germany it was translated and even dramatizedand has created a literatureEven Franceoversatiated with pornographywas for a moment stirred at the appearance of the sensational noveluntil a new scandal captured the limelightFinallywith the customary Anglo Saxon retardationwe have the book in English The universality of Artzibashev s appeal is thus evidentand the question arises What is the underlying force that makes the book arouse interestadmirationand indignation in various tongues and countriesTo my mindthis is the answerThe authora typical representative of our agehas performed a purely subjectiveintrospective studyhence he has voiced the ideas of his contemporarieshence he is so readily understood and appreciated by the children of our civilizationFrancis Hackettwhowhen he writes on bookshas no equal in this countryhas remarked with his usual insight It is plain that for himself Artzibashev has made not a manbut a heroa god To this true statement I wish to add that when we humans erect a godwe endow him with those qualities and virtues which we ourselves lackwhich to us are but unattainable desiderataArtzibashev glorifies Sanin because he himself is Sanin s antipodethe whiningimpotent Youriiwhom he paints with obvious disgustThis is no sheer presumption I have followed the author s Sanineby Michael ArtzibashevBWHuebschNew York There is hardly any danger of the book being persecuted by Anthony Comstockfor whatever pernicious influence it might have had has been splendidly neutralized through the wretched translation which evidently was rendered from the French versionin its turn a poor translation from the Germanthis explains does it justify the cosmopolitan transliteration of the proper names and the numerous nonsensical errorsThe publisher threatens to present the public with Artzibashef s

as I sneezed just nowWas that the right thing to doWill it not cause harm to some oneHave Iin sneezingfulfilled my destinyBut the idealist Artzibashev Yourii lived not in the cloudsbut in the midst of the StPetersburg Bohèmewith the decadent crowd of the restaurantViennaa life of questionable virtuousness and of dubious hygieneHe conceived the idea of Sanin when he had become almost a physical wreckforced to spend his timewhen not inVienna in a resort in CrimeaIncapable of enjoying carnal life any longeryet morbidly craving to empty the cup of sensuous pleasures to the dregshe creates for himself a fetishan ideal malestripped of all human weaknessesdoubtingsand questioningsfree of all principles but the principle of professing no principlesliving to the full the life of a healthy

with one another and with the general ennui of their lifeaimlessly piningstriving purposelesslyIn such a setting the figure of Sanin naturally looms up as the least boring individualBut try to transfer the hero from this stage of marionettes into real Russianorfor that matterinto any life full of struggle and love and passionand what a platitudinousuninteresting figure he will make In what he says is nothing strikingly new his discourses on Christianity or on morality could have been borrowed from any modern rank and file radicalAs to what he does wellit is zoologyA witty critic has endeavored to pin to him the label of Supermanwhat an insult for our herowho after a feast of vodkacucumbersand cheap cigarettes undressed and got into bedwhere he tried to read Thus spake Zarathustra

disaffection and unrestraintOur taste is childisha capriciousintermittent taste good once in a whilenever lastingand by no means frequentSuch a taste gives a few pleasures but not the developed one of judgmentIt never lasts long enough to be imposedWe are unable to pair two congenial traditions and get a tendencyThere is nothing for it but to welcome another generation of incomprehensible foreigners in the hope that among them will be found a mate for our very real desire for fine thingsOne country has sent us little inspirationHer natives do not willingly leave her soft sky for our harsh brilliant western sunThey have a proverbial preference for her gentle manner and speechFor our youth she has the admiration and envy of agefor our red knuckles and large ankles she has the indulgence of one who has been beautiful for many loversbut for our loud mouthed demand for adulation she has the aloofness of one who has still many courtiersIf we go fearfully as befits our youth and humbly as befits our awkwardness to Parisinstead of waiting for Paris the beautiful to come to usperhaps we shall receive what Berlin and London have not yet given usLondon came to us willingly with a scholarly something that was better than our previous nothingBerlin forced on us a manner of strong professionalism that was better than our previous weaknessNow we are beyond the age of facile conquests and we mustat the risk of being rebuffed and made unhappyseek the favor of a lady who stays at homeSince the spirit of Mozart and Beethoven and Schubert left ViennaMusic has loved no cityWe shall soon agree that she did not love Weimar greatly nor Munich at all nor Leipsig enoughAs for the lusty person who flaunts a passion for Berlinwe must call her a maid masquerading in her mistress s cloak ifindeedwe concede her a resemblance to music at allThe joy of loveliness admiredthe frankness and naivetethejeu perleand natural melodiousness that were the life of Viennese Music vanished utterly with the death of Schubert unknownIt seemed that he and his predecessors must have brought music into a cul de sac from which it would have to extricate itselfGerman music did and received new impetus from the professionalism of Weberthe literary romanticism of Lisztthe savoir vivre of Chopinand the cosmicality of WagnerFrancemeanwhileentertained loyally the older mannernursing it through its unpopularity into the convalescence it now enjoysWhen we come to discover that the spirit of Berlin is rather of something hyphenated toKulturthan of music purelywe shall also discover the spirit of Viennavigorous and slightly Frenchifiedin the Conservatoire and the Schola CantorumSomehowwithout the least effort or meritwe have strolled into the position of thedistinguished amateur It is an eminence from which one may see everything if one but keep a clear eye and a doubting mindWhat fools we should be to view the road before us as we can only this oncewearing a prejudice like a pair of smoked gogglesTo doubt is a privilege which the wise will make a dutyWe should doubt what has given us our artistic existenceand if it can only stand by our faith it will fall but we shall not fall with itWe should doubt the things we desire so that when we abandon them we cannot be reproached with broken faithWe must doubt the strength of organized professionalism that Berlin would teach usthe value of hard work the contrapunctalists of the Royal Academy preach we must doubt the superiority of art and the artistthe inviolability of traditionthe legitimacy of the Beethoven Wagner Strauss succession for the reason that they have been so freely offered if for no otherSurely such eagerness to be accepted does not prove great worthLet us pooh pooh all these magnificentPooh Bahsof music to see if their threats to have our heads off are real or bluffThen with our tongues still in our cheekslet us continue on to other courts If we have enjoyed the simple and fine art with which Beethoven and Schubert enlivened and refined the salons of Viennawe shall enjoy FranckIf we should prefer our Mozart livelier by a notch of the metronome and lighter by one half of the strings than we hear it nowwe should be pleased by Chabrier and Faure and the way they are played by the half dozen youngsters who get their premier prix at the end of each year s work in the ConservatoireFrom pure inertia

the promise of occult things was not fulfilledfor with the cessation of the music came a rosy glowand then a gracious lady with a wistful presenceAnd she seemed quite at ease in her mise en scèneShe read to us of herselfof Prince Hassan s feast in Parisof her theatrical meeting with Strindbergand of how he talked with her all the evening and later walked home with her of how she stopped on the bridge to toss snowballs and Strindberg dried her hands upon his handerchief and of how she dreamed of him that memorable night a strange symbolicdreamAnd as she readher face was as quiet water

audience seemed frozen into inarticulatenessThose few who did venture stammered for a moment and then drooped into silenceMadamehoweverwas not discouragedShe read us Strindberg s views on divorceIn reply to the mumbled questions she replied that she considered eugenics impractical and indelicatethat her husband had believed intensely in peace and had written a beautiful story in its favorwhich she had meant to read us but to which an accident had occurred that Strindberg was a democrat in theory but an aristocrat in feelingthat he was not a misogynistbut had reviled bad women because he

his cue from the adorable will of this new God he framed ever more earnest and more sacred rules of lifeThese were radical and revolutionary novelties to the old culturewhich speedily scented the dangers menacing itand as speedily dispatched executioners to the rescueIn the language of its old theologythe language of StAugustinethis was called the war of the Kingdom of the World against the Kingdom of GodAny well informed scholar can recall what were said to be the hindrances which the Kingdom of God had at first to overcomeand how today these hindrances still offer the same resistance degenerate paganismwith its powers of unbeliefand with its supremacy of theflesh Judaismapostate from Godwith its priests and scribes It is not within the scope of my task to inquire how far this traditional schema of the upheavals at the tumultuous beginnings of our era coincide with the factsOnly one consideration concerns me at this timeand that one is not open to question change as the phenomena of history maythe laws of those phenomena remain ever the sameAccordinglyeven the resistances which time s new unfolding life has to surmountever returnusually under a changed nameindeedand they will continue to do so as long as there is a history of human culture in the life of the worldPassing onnowto speak of the forces which the most modern prophet of a new cultureFriedrich Nietzschelooks upon as the most grievous hindrances to a new kind of manwe shall surely expect to see first of allquite other faces than those which the pious fathers of the old church saw in the foes of the civitas die stillwe shall re discoversignificantly enoughmany an old acquaintance behind the strange re modeled maskAs in that old dayso in ourswe shall perceive in these foes of a new lifenothing of their hostility to lifeIn partthey appear quite harmless in partthey are the universally dined and wined celebrities of the day at whom the masses stare as the special pioneers of our cultureand in whom the masses applaud the bearers and promoters of the best achievements of our cultureIt would be certainly a very one sided and unhistorical way of looking at things were we to hold those particular individualswho did duty in the olden days in synagogues of the scribe s learningprimarily responsible for the warfare which ancient Christianity had to sustain against the dominant religious partiesespecially against the scribes and their followersThe war was not waged against personsbut against a systemThe synagogue was the school of the Jewsthe scribes were the masters in that schoolViewed from this sideChristianity seemed to be rebellion against the authority of the schooland an emancipation of humanity from the influence which the toasted masters of the school exercised over spiritsApproaching the problemthenas to how far such an emancipation would be serviceable todayone need scarcely say that one does not at all have in mind the institutions whichin a narrower sensewe now have come to callschools Asfor broad gauge philosophersthe concept priesthood is by no means identical with a definite officethe so calledThe Little Review 39 clerical officeso what we understand by school and its mastersin Nietzsche s senseembraces a much wider circle than we are wont to thinkThere are schoolmasters in all vocations and callings and positionsnot alone among scholarsbut also among artistspoliticianslaborers and merchantsWe find them in the household and in the nurseryfor schoolmaster ism is a certain kind of spiritand it is this kind of spirit whichunder various namesNietzsche pursues with his bitterest scorn and ridiculewhich he stigmatizes as the most perilous hindrance in the path of the new cultureWe modern men must concede that Nietzsche is right

serious question stares at us in the name of the school todayThis question is above all questions of school reformwhich seem so important to usfor the improvednaythe best school remains just schoolAnd something of schoolmasterism and scholasticism cleaves to school And therefore Nietzsche was its so bitter foe because he would have menmen who spoke and thought and felt powerfully and not as the scribes Nietzsche was its foe because he would have among menpersonalitiesindividualitiesdiversitiesnot uniformity and identity of spiritual lfeIfnowwe have rightly comprehended the force of this censure against the school and its masterwe are already in the way to overcome and to heal this school maladyThe malady does not inhere in the school as suchbut in the false evaluation which we of today attribute to itand in the dominion which the school exercises over human spiritsby virtue of this false appraisalWe think we can read if we have learned to read in schoolBut this learning to read has yet to begin Whoever does not begin it his own selfwill never truly learn it at allWe call our schools educational institutions and yet they are altogether mutational institutionsafter which the true human education first beginsWe do not think of thisthat this man whose knowledge still tastes of his schoolwhose art shows his schoolis still stuck in his schooland has not made proper use of his school which is to apply itespecially to overcome it Orrather we think still lessWe rest on the laurels of our schooland if we won them we think that we have carried off the warrior s prize of lifeBut it is our faultnot the school sif the school narrows rather than broadens our visionif it binds us to its rules instead of releasing us from themWhere are the men who still learn after schoolnaywho first begin then to learn what after all is the main thing of all learninghow they can become greaterfreer menindependent personalitiesHow does it come that all stirring and moving of the modern spirit is at the same time an insurrection against some kind of schoolHow does it come that all creativepath breaking spirits can begin to createto liveonly when they have snapped the fetters of some schoolAnd how does it come that great discoveries of unknown islands of the human have never been made withinbut only withoutthe schoolsMost of allhow does it come that a Christ can speak with power only when he has learned not to speak as the scribes and schoolmastersThe answer in every case is that we are accustomed to expect of the school whataccording to its very natureit cannot donamely to give lifeto create lifeThereforeit is all important that we keep the path openwide opento the fountain of life in the abyss of the human heartin the unfathomableness of the worldso that we too may learn to speak with power and not as the scribes so thatThe Little Review 43our schools may not be diseases to be overcomefor many never overcome during an entire lifebut a staff with which we

American music critic to quote a naive English journalAnd Pippa dancesIBN GABIROL 46 The Little Review Music GABRILOWITSCH AND THE NEW STANDARD MARGARET CANDERSON make their impressions very slowlybut they travel very fastThat is why Gabrilowitsch s playing of the piano on March 21 was two different kinds of revelation to two different kinds of peopleTo a great many it was a rich fulfillment of promise to a few it was the end of something that had had a great beginningThe trouble is that there s a new standard to reckon withWe used to argue that what a man had to say was more important than the way he said itThen we reversed thatclaiming that a man may say anything provided he say it wellThen the socialistic school tried to go back to the first premisebut what they were really groping for was the new standardwhich is simply this A man may still say anything he wishes and if he says it well it will be art provided he really has something to sayTennyson knew how to say things wellbut he missed being an artist because he had nothing to sayOn what basis do we establish such a criterionNot merely on that ofideas because you may have no ideas at all and yet have profound reactionsand not merely on that ofsocialismor sincerity or ideals and not oh wellI mean to get through this discussion without dragging in the artist s alleged monopoly of the eternal veritiesBRussell Herts got very close to what I mean when he said that Arnold Bennett missed real bigness because he had only a great and mighty skill without having a great and mighty soulWell you can t make Artwe think nowunless you belong in the great and mighty soul classAnd what does that meanexactlyPerhaps the whole thing can be explained under the termenlarged consciousness I wish Dora Marsden would discuss it in one of those clear headed articles she writes for The EgoistThe confusion in all our discussions of matter and mannerof subject and formof what determines geniushas come about in two main ways firstbecause we have made Taste a synonym for Art so that if we like Beethoven or Mozart we don t accept Wagner or Max Regeror if we like classic rules we call romanticismbad artand secondbecause we have decided who had great and mighty souls on an ethical basisWe said that Browning and Tennyson had them chiefly because they talked a great deal about GodI suppose which only shows how confusing it is to judge that wayit leaves no room for the distinctionThe Little Review that Browning had and Tennyson hadn tIt s all as silly as insisting that the cubists ought to be considered great if they are sincereGrant that they areTo be sincere is easy to say what you believe is simple but to believe something worth saying is the test of an artSincere stupid people are as bad as any other stupid ones and more boringI don t know what else to say about itbut Iknow you can recognize thatenlarged consciousnessin the first bars of a pianist s playingor in a singer s beginning of a songPaderewski has it to such a degree that he can play wrong notes and it doesn t matter and Duse has itand Kreislerand Isadore Duncanand Ludwig Wullnerwho breaks your heart with his songs though he hasn t even a singing voiceAnd the disappointment in Gabrilowitch is that lie hasn tI went to hear him play Chopin and Schumann with positive excitementGodowskywith all his perfectly worked out theoriesalways leaves me with the feeling that he would be an artist if he weren t an empty shell and Bauerwith all his beautiful workleaves me with a sense of how he might play if a fire could be started inside himI expected that fire in Gabrilowitsch partly because I heard him play ten years ago and partlyI supposebecause he is RussianBut the ten years have left him unstirredIt s as though the man in him had stood curiously still as though life had passed himHe is like a poet who has somehow escaped unhurt or a technician who perfects his expression and then wonders what he shall expressAs for his formhe does many exquisite things for instancehis Des Abendswhich was extremely poetic and which seems to be the type of thing he likes to play mostAnd he played the D Flat Prelude with an exquisite perspective and then a Chopin Waltz without any perspective at allTechnically his worst feature is his chord work Bauer s chords sound like an organ in comparisonBut Bauer knows how to touch the piano for deep darkeffectsand Gabrilowitsch appears to likebrightsoundsHe takes his chords with a hightight wrist and brings them out by poundingThese things are not done any more the piano has shown new tone capacities since a few of the moderns abandonedor modifiedwhat is supposed to be thestraightLetschitizky methodWeilall this wouldn t matter so much if Gabrilowitsch had the ultimate inspirationSomehow

with an extraordinary brillianceilluminating a theretofore unknown world ofha sbeens of Nietzschean BosyakiGorky s geniuswe may saywas elemental and local it revealed a great spontaneous force on the part of the writer in a peculiar atmosphereonthe bottomof lifein the realm of care free vagabondsAs soon as Gorky trespassed his circle he fell into the pit of mediocrity and began to produce second rate playssermon novelspolitical sketchesand similar writings that may serve as excellent material for the propaganda lecturerThe present volume may be looked upon as Gorky s swan songif we consider his ill health in fact he outlived himself long ago as an artistand in these Tales we witness the hectic flush of the autumn of his careerThe exotic beauty of Italy appears under the pen of the Capri invalid in a morbidconsumptive aspect the author is too self conscioustoo much aware of the fact of his moribund existence to see the intrinsic in lifeThe tendency to preach socialism further augments his artistic daltonismwhich is particularly evident in the Russian TalesThe doomed man casts a weary glance over his distant native landand he sees there nothing but dismal blackhopeless pettiness and retrogressionThe satire is blunt and fails the markthe allegories are of the vulgarwoodcut varietyGorky has been dead for many yearsBREAKING INTO AN OPEN DOOR Plaster Saintsby Israel Zangwill The

superiors in sinfulness50 The Little ReviewIt is all very wellif we grant that society is still in need of sermons on chastityif the Hebraic ideal of monogamy is still the most important problem in the life of a communityto be discussed and advocated from the pulpitwhile ignoring the economic and social complexities of the present ageBut can we grant this anachronismIs it not high time to follow the policy of laisser faire in regard to individual moralsMrZangwill appears in the unenvious position of one quixotically breaking into an open dooryet he has been accused of possessing a sense of humor MAGAZINE VERSE Anthology of Magazine Verse1914selected and published by William SBraithwqite The proper way to review this collection of verse would beno doubtto quote some of the best and some of the worstmake a learned and perfectly empty comment upon so and soand say that the book was better or worse than last year s compilationBut MrBraithwaite has sifted and re sifted the entire crop of poems until there is in his book nothing but the bestsuch as it isAnd the general trend of the volume is scarcely a matter for enthusiasmA fair conclusion must be that magazine editors were frequently hard pressed for copyAs a faithful and stupidly patriotic Americanone should ponder long over certain attempts to found newAmericanverse formsbut it is to be regrettedpossiblythat the most enjoyable poems in the collection are written upon foreign or mediaeval topicsAs a true aestheteone ought to reek with admiration for nameless or badly labelled sonnetts thatfor some reasonfail to delightAndas an exponent of politico poetic modernitythere should be wild raving over theradicalart of formless formbut this also is shamefully wanting in one s reaction to this anthologyA number of intelligent humans have been observed in their expectant approach to this collectionthey closed the book with neither smiles nor frownsIt is difficult to forget that good poetry will bear rereadingor prove its worth by clinging to the memoryand it is still more difficult to remember that art has only to be newrudeor extreme to be called wonderfulWhy is this The Little Review 51 John Cowper Powys on Henry JamesSome more jottings from one of MrPowys s lectures Henry James is a revealer of secretsbut never does he entirely draw the veilHe has the most reluctancethe most reverence of all the great novelistsHe is always reluctant to draw the last veilThis greatplump handed moribund figurewaits afraidAll of his work is a mirror never a softening or blurring of outlinesbut a medium through which one sees the world as he sees itIn reading his works one never forgets the authorAll his people speak in his characterAll is attuned to his tone from beginning to endHe uses slang with a curious kind of condescensionall kinds of slangwith a tacit implicit apology to the readerSo line a spirit he is not at home with slangHis work divides itself into three periods best between 1900 and 1903In reading him approximate 1900 as the climateric periodHis character delineation is superbRalph in The Portrait of a Ladyis the type of those who have difficulty in asserting themselves and are in a peculiar way hurt by contact with the worldOsborne in the same book is one of those peculiarly hardselfishartisticsuper refined people who turn into ice whatever they touchHe personifies the cruelty of a certain type of egoism the immorality of laying a dead hand upon lifePoe has that tendency to lay a dead hand upon what he cares for and stop it from changingWho of us with artistic sensibilities is not afflicted with this immoralityThis is the unpardonable sin more than lust more than passion anecrophilism to lay the dead hand of eternal possession upon a young headNothing exists but civilization for HJThere has been no such writer since VergilAnd for himHJ there is but one civilization EuropeanHe is the cosmopolitan novelistHe describes Paris as no Frenchman does Not only Parisbut AmericaItalyanywhere the reader falls into a delicious passivity to the synthesis of nationsHe knows them all and is at home in allHe is the novelist of societySociety which is the one grand outrageit is not pain it is not pityit is society which is the outrage upon personalitythe permanent insultthe punishment to lifeAs ordinary people we hate it often as philosophers and artists we are bitter against itas hermits we are simply on the rackRut it is through their little conventionalities that HJdiscovers peoplehuman beingsinSocietyHe uses these conventionalities to portray his charactersHe hears paeans of liberationhells of pity and sorrowand distress as people signal to one another across these little conventionalitiesHe fills the social atmosphere with rumors and whispers of people toward one anotherIn describing city and country he is equally greatHe does not paint with wordsbut simply transports you thereRead The Ambassadors for French sceneryEverything is treated sacramentallyHe is the Walter Pater of novelists with an Epicurean sense for little things for little things that happen every dayThere is another element in his work that is psychic and beyond magnetic and beyondHis people are held together by its vibrationsRead The Two MagicsHJis the apostle to the richMoneythat accursed thingHe understands its importanceIt lends itself in every direction to the tragedy of beingHe understands the art of the kind of life in which one can do what one wantsHe understands the rich American gentleman in Europe touches his natural chastityhis goodnessthe

WhistlerOscarPater all together and something added the arch ghost the moth of the cult of artThe countenance of HJsays that he might have been the crudest and is the tenderest of human beingsTo him

the churchyardwhereunder the dank earth he knows that the changing lineaments mold themselves into the sardonic grin of humanity The Reader Critic William Thurston BrownChicagoI have just read your article on MrsEllis s lectureand I wish to congratulate you upon its sentimentsAlthough I did not hear MrsEllissome of my friends didand their report quite agrees with your judgmentI must confess I did not expect much from her to begin withFrom interviews and quotations it seemed clear that she was simply one who had never faced realities franklyBesidesher rather mawkishreligiousnessbetrayed a mind unfitted to deal adequately with such a problemI wish also to congratulate you upon your recognition of the genuine worth of Emma GoldmanI had thought you were in danger of making a fetich of herbut this article shows that you appreciate the things for which she standsI cannot believe that the superiority of Emma Goldman to such people as MrsEllis I mean in the discernment of real values is due to a difference of psychologyor rather of temperamentbut rather to the difference of point of view from which Miss Goldman has seen the problems of human lifeHer experience as a protagonist of Labor in its struggle for freedom from exploitation has been a vital factorI thinkin her developmentAll good wishes to THE LITTLE REVIEW Albrecht CKippIndianapolis Some time ago a friend of yoursand mineunder guise of a Yuletide remembranceinnocently and unapprehensive of the consequences no doubtpresented me with a year s subscription to the magazine which you purport to editOur mutual acquaintance made some point of the fact that you wereas I aspire to bea Truth Seekerand also alludedin passingto a feminine pulchitrude which you possessednot ordinarily a concomitant of an intellectual curiosity sufficiently keen to delve to the bottom of things material and spiritualI therefore looked forward with undeniable expectation to a gratification of an insatiable desire to view the remains of many idols and statues still unbrokenwhich have been laboriously erected by the prejudicecredulity and ignorance of mankind for eonsPermit me to apprise you of my keen disappointment in perusing what I have found ensconced between the covers of your magazineI was given to understand that you were a quasi missionaryin the most elastic sense of that wordand as one who is sincerely trying to fathom your missionif one you haveI am writing to ascertain what it may bebecauseowing either to an utter failure of a somewhat impoverished sense of humor or a too ordinary quantum of common senseI seem to miss what you are driving atIf your magazine is designed to interest a coterie of semi crazedhalfbaked fin de siècleideologistsI would appreciate a recognition of your objectTo be quite frank with youhoweverI do not yet consider myself in the proper frame of mind to be classified in that category of readers without demurI am only a humble Searcher for the Truth in Life in all its phases and being congenitally opposed to the baleful spreading ofBuschwa I seem to find my mental equipoise disturbed by an attempt to diagnose by any rational standard most of the alleged literary ebullitions which find place in your REVIEWIf we were still living in the Stone Age and reading matter of any sort were still a scarce articleit might be necessary to put up with the poetical balderdash which you publishBut having the daily newspapers to contend with and other pernicious thiefs of valuable timeit seems a heinous offense to a perfectly respectable mind to offer itthe unripe or overripemayhapproducts of insane mentalitiesNo doubt the fault is entirely that of an unschooled intellectbut at thatI have to take my mind as it isJust as it is unable to fathom this Christian Science drivelin that same measure does it utterly fail to be touched by what has appeared in THE LITTLE REVIEW of the past four monthsLet me assure you that I have made an honest effort to understated your viewpointUnlesshoweverI am cleared up as to what your aim and goal may lie1 am compelledin self defenseto request you to kindly discontinue sending your magazine to meIt may deflour my joy of life and ruin a saving and virtuous sense of the funnyYou are too kindhearted1 am sureas our mutual acquaintance informs meto be an accessory before the fact to such an ungracious crimeSada CowanNew YorkYour article on MrsHavelock Ellis was wonderfulMrsEllis failed herejust as in ChicagoI admire the clear and concise way in which you illumined the reason of her failureThere is so much work to be done it seems wicked that a womanto whom the world is so ready and willing to listenwho has the gift of poetic expression and direct logical thinkingshould waste her powersIt is as though she held understanding and wisdom in her hands tightly clenched then when she should hold out those gifts to the worldshe opened wide her fingers here a flash there a glimmerAnd all vanishes ECASmithGrosse IleMichiganI was delighted with your critique on MrsEllisnot that I feel she fell as short as you seem to thinkhut because your own article made a beginning on things which must be said1 also emphatically endorse your views on enabling the poor to restrict their birthratenot on sentimental groundsbut because I know by experience it would be a wise economy for the stateIt is natural for wholesome people to want children the rise in the labor market caused by the dropping off in production by the cowardly and incompetent would be amply compensated by the reduction in the ranks of economically valueless dependentsIt would take lessper capitato support orphan and insane asylumsdispensariesand jails not to speak of the wasteful drain of unestimated sporadic charityThe contention that it would contribute to immorality is absolutely absurd to anyone who has tried rescue work girls have child after childundeterred by pain or shamejust as the mentally deficient in other lines injure themselves in their frenziesThe only way one has a right to judge life is to look at it from the insideBefore I read Havelock Ellis 1 was unable to take this view of the subjects you so sanely and clearly project on our imaginationsAfter laying down his book I found my only shock came from some of the methods employed incuringthese unfortunatesFrom the histories of cases he citesI should consider it fair to conclude that the nervous organization of inverts tended to average below par as is the usual medical viewThis may be a psychicnot physicalresultPersonallyI cannot see any effect the reading of that material has had on me except to make me more wisely charitable in my viewsIt has broadened my idealswithout weakening themIt has put a new value on normalityIt has not modified my personal theory of love any more than the not entirely aesthetic conditions of carrying and bearing my children didThere are points about that sort of experience especially the attitude of the inexperiencedwhich makes the prude s attitude to the whole broad question ridiculousAnother generation will regard ours as we do the Victorians nay shade will grind its spirit teeth to hear them laughI am not sure your point of view as a writer rather than a speaker does not make you overlook legitimate limitations in MrsEllis s positionA speaker can often suggest far more than she actually utters the conclusions people are inspired to make for themselves are of far greater value than if they were cast forth with inspired eloquenceTo antagonize an audience by forcing your point is to lose efficiencyIn print one has not the personal element so strongly and immediately to considerPerhaps she was subtler than Emma Goldmanbut not so much weaker as you thinkTHE LITTLE REVIEW is the most satisfactory source of mental stimulation I have yet discoveredIf I do not always agree with it I at least have the sense of arguing with a friend whose intellect I respect never did I feel that for any other publicationAnd I love freshness and freedom and enthusiasm as I love youth its elf they re the qualities that promise growthStella Worden SmithMonte Vista HeightsCalFor six months or so I have been blessed with the presense of your LITTLE REVIEWMany times I have wanted to tell you soIt is a matter of deep gratitude that at last one can open the pages of a magazine and feel that sense of freedom and incomparable beauty that one does insaylooking out at a sunset across the mountainsand no more hamperingYou give new horizonsfresh inspirationand revive the creative impulse that is more likely to be snuffed out than stimulated when one peruses the majority of ourbestmagazinesForgive me if I seem over enthusiasticbut it springs from a gratitude born of great needAnd you have filled itYour review of MrPowys s lectures have carried me back four years into a period when I was studying music in New York with a Norwegian singerand she and IThe Little Review listened to him at the Brooklyn Institute week by weekNever will I forget itAnd she wellshe is a genius herselfan interpreter of Norwegian folk songs and Powys lit her soul until it flamed forth like a beaconIf you heard his ShelleyI think yuii saw the veritable incarnation of that transcendent spiritThen I listened to him again in Buffalolast yearon KeatsAnd the audiencemostly womenGod forgive them seemed like school children noI will not confound such innocent souls with the inert mass that confronted himAnd this is our cultureI think the spirit of your magazine is to other magazines what Powys is to other lecturersHe makes you forget that he is suchYou become part of his themeor is ithimself 7 And so it is I seem both to lose and find myself when I read the pages of TriE LITTLE REVIEW TheLittle
