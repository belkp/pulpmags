carrying a canecrept through the underbrush bordering the corral of the Buckler farmAs he moved small twigs snappedfell and were silentHis knees were green from wounded shrubbery and grassand his outspread hands tore unheeded plantsHis wrists hurt him and he rested from time to timealways caring for his hat and knotted yellow caneblowing through his moustacheDew had been falling covering the twilight leaves like myriad facesdamp with the perspiration of the struggle for existenceand half a mile awaystanding out against the darkness of the nighta grove of white birches shimmeredlike teeth in a skullHe heard the creaking of a gateand the splashing of late rain into the depths of a dark cisternHis heart ached with the nearness of the earththe faint murmur of it moving upon itselflike a sleeper who turns to throw an arm about a belovedA frog began moaning among the skunk cabbagesand John thrust his hand deep into his bosomSomething somnolent seemed to be hereand he wonderedIt was like a deepheavyyet soft prison wherewithout sinone may suffer intolerable punishmentPresently he went onfeeling his wayHe reached a high plank fence and sensing it with his fingershe lay downresting his head against the groundHe was tiredhe wanted to sleepbut he searched for his hat and cane and straightened out his coat beneath him before he turned his eyes to the starsAnd now he could not sleepand wondered why he had thought of itsomething quick was moving the earthit seemed to liveto shake with sudden immensityHe heard a dog barkingand the dim light from a farm window kept winking as the trees swung against its square of lightThe odor of daisies came to himand the assuringpowerful smell of the stableshe opened his mouth and drew in his moustacheA faint tumult had begunA tremor ran under the length of his body and trembled off into the earth like a shudder of joydied down and repeated itselfAnd presently he began to trembleansweringthrowing out his handscurling them up weaklyas if the earth were withholding something preciousnecessaryHis hat fell offstriking a log with a dull hollow soundand he pressed his red moustache against the grass weepingAgain he heard itfelt ita hundred hoofs beat upon the earth and he knew the horses had gone wild in the corral on the other side of the fencefor animals greet the summerstriking the earthas friends strike the back of friendsHe knewhe understooda hail to summerto lifeto deathHe drew himself against the barspressing his eyes under thempeeringwaitingHe heard them coming up across the heavy turfrounding the curve in the Willow RoadHe opened his eyes and closed them againThe soft menacing sound deepenedas heat deepensstrikes through the skin into the very fleshHead onwith long legs risingfallingrising againstriking the ground insanelylike needles taking terribleimpossible and purposeless stitchesHe saw their belliesfawn coloredpitching from side to sideflashing bystraining the fenceand he rose up on his feet and silentlyswiftlyfled on beside themSomething delirioushystericalcame over him and he fellBlood trickled into his eyes down from his foreheadIt had a fine feeling for a momentlike a manelike that roan mare s mane that had passed him red and long and splendidHe lifted his handand closed his eyes once morebut the soft pounding did not ceasethough nowin his sitting positionit only jogged him imperceptiblyas a child on a kneeIt seemed to him that he was smotheringand he felt along the side of his face as he had done in youth when they had put a cap on him that was too largeTwining green thingsmoist with earth bloodcrept over his fingersthe hotimpatient leaves pressed inand the green of the matted grass was deathly thickHe had heard about the freeness of naturethought it was soand it

Pipe leaned against his neckstaring with black eyesand John opened his mouthrunning his tongue across his lips snapping it offsighingMove as he wouldthe grass was always under himand the crackling of last autumn s leaves and last summer s twigs minute dead of the infinite greatness troubled himSomething por tentuous seemed connected with the patient noises about himAn acotn droppedstriking a thin fine powder out of a frail oak podHe took it uptossing itHe had never liked to see things fallHe sat upwith the dim thunder of the horses far offbut quickening his heartHe went over the scene he had with Freda Bucklerhack there in the housethe long quivering spears of pot grass standing by the window as she walked up and downpulling at themtalking to himSmallwith cunning fiery eyes and a pink and pointed chinA daughter of a mother who had known too many admirers in her youtha woman with an ample Jap on which she held a Persian kitten or a trifle of fruitBountyavaricedesireintelligence both of them had always what they wantedHe blew down his moustache again thinking of Freda in her floating yellow veil that he had called ridiculousShe had not been angryhe was nothing but a stable boy thenIt was the way with those small intriguing women whose nostrils were made delicate through the pain of many generation that they might quiver whenever they caught a whiff of the stables As near as they can get to the earth he had said and was Freda angryShe stroked his arm always softlylooking awayan inner bitterness drawing down her mouthShe saidwalking up and down quickylooking ridiculously small

horsesrealizing that when he should have married this smallunpleasant and clever womanhe wouid know them no moreIt was a game between themwhich was the shrewderwhich would win outHeA boy of ill breedinggrown from the gutterfancied by this woman because he had called her ridiculousor for some other reasonthat he would never knowThis kind of person never tells the truthand thismore than most thingstroubled himWas he a thing to be played withdebased into something better than he wasthan he knewPartly because he was proud of himself in the costume of a groompartly because he was timidhe desired to get awayto go back to the stablesHe walked up to the mirrors as if about to challenge thempeering inHe knew he would look absurdand then knewwith shamethat he looked splendidly better than most of the gentlemen that Freda Buckler knewHe hated himselfA man who had grown out of the city s streetsa fine common thingShe saw him looking into the mirrorsone after the otherand drew her mouth downShe got upwalking beside him in the endbetween him and themtaking his arm You shall enter the army you shall rise to Generalor Lieutenant at least and there are horses thereand the sound of stirrups with that physique you will be happy authority you know she said shaking her chinsmiling Very wellbut a common soldier As you like afterwardAfterwardVery wella common soldier He sensed something strange in her voicea sort of irony and it took the patience out of him I have always been commonI could commit crimeseasilygladly I d like to She looked away That s natural she said faintly it s an instinct all strong men haveShe knew what was troubling himthwarted instinctscommon beautiful instincts that he was being robbed ofHe wanted to do something final to prove his lower ordercaught himself making facesidiot facesand she laughed If only your ears stuck outchin receded she said you might look degeneratecommonbut as it is And he would creep away in hatcoat and cane to peer at his horses never daring to go in near themSometimes when he wanted to weep he would smear one glove with harness greasebut the other one he held behind his backpretending one was enough to prove his revoltShe would torment him with vasesbookspicturesmaking a fool of him gentlypersistentlymaking him doubt by cruel meansthe means of objects he was not used toeternally taking him out of his sphere We have the best collection of miniatures she would say with one knee on a low ottomanbringing them out in her small palm Herelook He would put his hands behind him She was a great woman Lucrezia Borgia do you know historyShe put it back again because he did not answerletting his minda curious onetorment itself You love things very muchdon t you she would question because she knew that he had a passion for one thing onlyShe kept placing new ladders beneath his feetonly to saw them off at the next rungmaking him nothing more than a nervous irritable experimentHe was uneasylike one given food to smell and not to tasteand for a while he had not wanted to tasteand then curiosity beganand he wanted toand he also wanted to escapeand he could do neitherWellafter he had married herwhat thenSatisfy her whim and where would he beHe would be nothingneither what he had been nor what other people wereThis seemed to himat timesher wish a sort of place between lying down and standing upa cramped positiona slow deathA curious womanThis same evening he had looked at her attentively for the first timeHer hair was rather prettythough too mousyyet just in the nape of the neckwhere it met the lawn of the collar it was very attractiveShe walked well for a little woman tooSometimes she would pretend to be livelywould run a little catch herself at itas if she had not intended to do itand calm down once moreor creeping up to himstroking his armtalking to himshe would walk beside him softlyslowly that he might not step outthat he would have to crawl across the carpetOnce he had thought of trying her with honestywith the truth of the situationPerhaps she would give him an honest answerand he had tried Now Miss Freda just a word what are you trying to doWhat is it you wantWhat is there in me that can interest youI want you to tell me I want to know I have got to ask someoneand I haven t anyone to ask but you And for a moment she almost relentedonly to discover that she could not if she had wishedShe did not know always what she meant herself Ill tell you she saidhoping that thissomehowmight lead her into the truthfor herselfif not for himbut it did not You are a little nervousyou will get used to it you will even grow to like it Be patientYou will learn soon enough that there is nothing in the world so agreeable as climbingchangingWell he said trying to read her And thenThat s allyou will regret the stables in the end that s allHer nostrils quiveredA light came into her eyesa desire to defyto be defiedAnd then on this last night he had done something terriblehe had made a blunderThere had been a partyThe guestsa lot of themwere mostly drunkor touched with drinkAnd he too had too muchHe remembered having thrown his arms about a tall womangowned in black with loose shoulder strapsdragging her through a danceHe had even sung a bit of a songmadlywildlyhorriblyAnd suddenly he had been brought up sharp by the fact that no one thought his behavior strangethat no one thought him presumptuousFreda s mother had not even moved or dropped the kitten from her lap where it satits loud resolute purr shaking the satin of her gownAnd he felt that Freda had got him where she wanted himbetween two rungsGoing directly up to her he said You are ridiculous and twirled his moustachespitting into the gardenAnd he knew nothing about what happened until he found himself in the shrubbery crawling toward the corralthrough the dusk and the dampness of the leavescarrying his canemaking sure of his hatlooking up at the starsAnd now he knew why he had comeHe was with his horses againHis eyespressed against the barsstared inThe black stallion in the lead had been his special peta rough animalbut kindlyknowingAnd here they were once moretearing up the grassgalloping about in the night like a ball room full of real peoplepeople who wanted to do thingswho did what ithey wanted to doHe began to crawl through the barsslowlydeftlyand when half way through he pausedthinkingPresently he went on againand drawing himself into the corralhis hat and cane thrown in before himhe lay there mouth to the grassThey were still runningbut less madlyone of them had gone up the Willow Road leading into a farther pasturein a flare of dustthrough which it looked immense and faintOn the top of the hill three or four of the horses were standingtesting the weatherHe would mount onehe would ride awayhe would escapeAnd his horsesthe things he knewwould be his escapeBarebackhe thoughtwould be like the days when he had taken what he could from the rush of the streetsjoyexhilarationlifeand he was not afraidHe wanted to stand upto cry aloudAnd he saw ten or twelve of them rounding the curveand he did stand upThey did not seem to know himdid not seem to know what to make of himand he stared at them wonderingHe did not think of his white shirt fronthis sudden arisingthe darknesstheir excitementSurely they would knowin a moment moreWheelingflaring their wet nostrilsthrowing up their manesstriking the earth in a quandarythey came onwhinnied faintlyand he knew what it was to be afraidHe had never been afraid and he went down on his kneesWith a new horror in his heart he damned themHe turned his eyes upbut he could not open themHe thought rapidlycalling on Freda in his heartspeaking tenderlypromisingA flare of heat passed his throat and descended into his bosom I want to liveI can do it damn it I can do itI can forge aheadmake my mark He forgot where he was for a moment and found new pleasure in this spoken admissionthis new rebellionHe moved with the faint shaking of the earth like a child on a woman s lapThe upraised hoofs of the first horse missed himbut the second did notAnd presently the horses drew apartnibbling here and thereswitching their tailsavoiding a patch of tall grass POEMS Wallace Stevens Architecture for the Adoration of Beauty I What manner of building shall we build for the adoration of beautyLet us design this chastel de chasteteDe pensee Never cease to deploy the structure Keep the laborers shouldering plinths Pass the whole of life earing the clink of the chisels of the stone cutters cutting the stonesII In this housewhat manner of utterance shall there beWhat heavenly dithyramb And cantileneWhat niggling forms of gargoyle patterOf what shall the speech beIn that splay of marble And of obedient pillarsIII And how shall those come vested that come thereIn their ugly remindersOr gaudy as tulipsAs they climb the stairs To the group of Flora Coddling HecubaAs they climb the flights To the closes Overlooking whole seasonsIV Let us build the building of lightPush up the towers To the cock topsThese are the pointings of our edificeWhichlike a gorgeous palmShall tuft the commonplaceThese are the window sill On which the quiet moonlight liesV How shall we hew the sunSplit it and make blocksTo build a ruddy palaceHow carve the violet moon To set in nicksLetus fix

a dark skingrey eyes and thick lipsShe was tall and strongWhen black thoughts visited her she grew angry and wished she were a man and could fight someone with her fistsShe worked in the millinery shop kept by MrsNate McHugh and during the day sat trimming hats by a window at the rear of the storeShe was the daughter of Henry Carpenter bookkeeper in the First National Bank of WinesburgOhio and lived with him in a gloomy old house far out at the end of Buckeye StreetThe house was surrounded by pine trees and there was no grass beneath the treesA rusty tin eaves trough had slipped from its fastenings at the back of the house and when the wind blew it beat against the roof of a small shedmaking a dismal drumming noise that sometimes persisted all through the nightWhen she was a young girl Henry Carpenter made life almost unbearable for his daughterbut as she emerged from girlhood into womanhood he lost his power over herThe bookeeper s life was made up of innumerable little pettinessesWhen he went to the bank in the morning he stepped into a closet and put on a black alpaca coat that had become shabby with ageAt night when he returned to his home he donned another black alpaca coatEvery evening 14 The Little Review he pressed the clothes worn in the streetsHe had invented an arrangement of boards for the purposeThe trousers to his street suit were placed between the boards and the boards were clamped together with heavy screwsIn the morning he wiped the boards with a damp cloth and stood them upright behind the dining room doorIf they were moved during the day he was speechless with anger and did not recover his equilibrium for a weekThe bank cashier was a little bully and was afraid of his daughterShehe realizedknew the story of his brutal treatment of the girl s mother and hated him for itOne day she went home at noon and carried a handful of soft mudtaken from the roadinto the houseWith the mud she smeared the face of the boards used for the pressing of trousers and then went back to her work feeling relieved and happyBelle Carpenter occasionally walked out in the evening with George Willarda reporter on the Winesburg EagleSecretly she loved another manbut her love affairabout which no one knewcaused her much anxietyShe was in love with Ed Handbybartender in Ed Griffith s Saloonand went about with the young reporter as a kind of relief to her feelingsShe did not think that her station in life would permit her to be seen in the company of the bartenderand she walked about under the trees with George Willard and let him kiss her to relieve a longing that was very insistent in her natureShe felt that she could keep the younger man within boundsAbout Ed Handby she was somewhat uncertainHandbythe bartenderwas a tall broad shouldered man of thirty who lived in a room upstairs above Griffiith s saloonHis fists were large and his eyes unusually small but his voiceas though striving to conceal the power back of his fistswas soft and quietAt twenty five the bartender had inherited a large farm from an uncle in IndianaWhen sold the farm brought in eight thousand dollars which Ed spent in six monthsGoing to Sanduskyon Lake Eriebe began an orgy of dissipationthe story of which afterward filled his home town with aweHere and there he went throwing the money aboutdriving carriages through the streetsgiving wine parties to crowds of men and womenplaying cards for high stakes and keeping mistresses whose wardrobes cost him hundreds of dollarsOne night at a resort called Cedar Point he got into a fight and ran amuck like a wild thingWith his fist he broke a large mirror in the wash room of a hotel and later went about smashing windows and breaking chairs in dance halls for the joy of hearing the glass rattle on the floor and seeing the terror in the eyes of clerkswho had come from Sandusky to spend the evening at the resort with their sweetheartsThe affair between Ed Handby and Belle Carpenter on the surface amounted to nothingHe had succeeded in spending but one evening in her companyOn that evening he hired a horse and buggy at Wesley Moyer s livery barn and took her for a driveThe conviction that she was the woman his nature demanded and that he must get hersettled upon him and he told her of his desiresThe bartender was ready to marry and to begin trying to earn money for the support of his wifebut so simple was his nature that he found it difficult to explain his intentionsHis body ached with physical longing and with his body he expressed himselfTaking the milliner into his arms and holding her tightlyin spite of her struggleshe kissed her until she became helplessThen he brought her back to town and let her out of the buggy When I get hold of you again I ll not let you goYou can t play with me he declared as he turned to drive awayThenjumping out of the buggyhe gripped her shoulders with his strong hands I ll keep you for good the next time he said You might as well make up your mind to thatIt s you and me for it and I m going to have you before I get throughOne night in January when there was a new moon George Wil lardwho wasin Ed Handby s mindthe only obstacle to his getting Belle Carpenterwent for a walkEarly that evening George went into Ransom Surbeck s pool room with Seth Richmond and Art Wilsonson of the town butcherSeth Richmond stood with his back against the wall and remained silentbut George Willard talkedThe pool room was filled with Winesburg boys and they talked of womenThe young reporter got into that veinHe said that women should look out for themselvesthat the fellow who went out with a girl was not responsible for what happenedAs he talked he looked abouteager for attenionHe held the floor for five minute and then Art Wilson began to talkArt was learning the barber s trade in Gal Prouse s shop and already began to consider himself an authority in such matters as baseballhorse racingdrinking and going about with womenHe began to tell of a night when he with two men from Winesburg went into a house of prostitution at the County SeatThe butcher s son held a cigar in the side of his mouth and as he talked spat on the floor The women in the place couldn t embarrass me although they tried hard enoughhe boasted One of the girls in the house tried to get fresh but I fooled herAs soon as she began to talk I went and sat in her lapEveryone in the room laughed when I kissed herI taught her to let me alone George Willard went out of the pool room and into Main StreetFor days the weather had been bitter cold with a high wind blowing down on the town from Lake Erieeighteen miles to the northbut on that night the wind had died away and a new moon made the night unusually lovelyWithout thinking where he was going or what he wanted to do George went out of Main Street and began walking in dimly lighted streets filled with frame housesOut of doors under the black sky filled with stars he forgot his companions of the pool roomBecause it was dark and he was alone be began to talk aloudIn a spirit of play he reded along the street imitating a drunken man and then imagined himself a soldier clad in shining boots that reached to the knees and wearing a sword that jingled as he walkedAs a soldier he pictured himself as an inspectorpassing before a long line of men who stood at attentionHe began to examine the accoutrements of the menBefore a tree he stopped and began to scold Your pack is not in order he said sharply How many times will I have to speak of this matterEverything must be in order hereWe have a difficult task before us and no difficult task can be done without order Hypnotized by his own words the young man stumbled along the board sidewalk saying more words There is a law for armies and for men too he mutteredlost in reflection The law begins with little things and spreads out until it covers everythingIn every little thing there must be orderin the place where men workin their clothesin their thoughtsI myself must be orderlyI must learn that lawI must get myself into touch with something orderly and big that swings through the night like a starIn my little way I must begin to learn somethingto give and swing and work with lifewith the law George Willard stopped by a picket fence near a street lamp and his body began to trembleHe had never before thought such thoughts as had just come into his head and he wondered where chey had come fromFor the moment it seemed to him that some voice outside of himself had been talking as he walkedHe was amazed and delighted with his own mind and when he walked on again spoke of the matter with fervor To come out of Ransom Surbeck s pool room and think things like that he whispered It is better to be aloneIf I talked like Art Wilson the boys would understand me but they wouldn t understand what I have been thinking down here In Winesburgas in all Ohio towns of twenty years agothere was a section in which lived day laborersAs the time of factories had not yet come the laborers worked in the fields or were section hands on the railroadsThey worked twelve hours a day and received one dollar for the long day of toilThe houses in which they lived were small cheaply constructed wooden affairs with a garden at the backThe more comfortable among them kept cows and perhaps a pighoused in a little shed at the rear of the gardenWith his head filled with resounding thoughts George Willard walked into such a street on the clear January nightThe street was dimly lighted and in places there was no sidewalkIn the scene that lay about him there was something that excited his already aroused fancyFor a year he had been devoting all of his odd moments to the reading ofbooks and now some tale he had read concerning life in old world towns of the middle ages came sharply back to his mind so that he stumbled forward with the curious feeling of one revisiting a place that bad been a part of some former existenceOn an impulse he turned out of the street and went into a little dark alleyway behind the sheds in which lived the cows and pigsFor a half hour he stayed in the alleywaysmelling the strong smell of animals too closely housed and letting his mind play with the strange new thoughts that came to himThe very rankness of the smell of manure in the clear sweet air awoke something heady in his brainThe poor little houses lighted by kerosene lampsthe smoke from the chimneys mounting straight up into the clear air18 The Little Review the grunting of pigsthe women clad in cheap calico dresses and washing dishes in the kitchensthe footsteps of men coming out of the houses and going off to the stores and saloons of Main Streetthe dogs barking and die children crying all these things made him seemas he lurked in the darknessoddly detached and apart from all lifeThe excited young manunable to bear the weight of his own thoughtsbegan to move cautiously along the alleywayA dog attacked him and had to be driven away with stones and a man appeared at the door of one of the houses and began to swear at the dogGeorge went into a vacant lot and throwing back his head looked up at the skyHe felt unutterably big and re made by the simple experiencethrough which he had been passing and in a kind of fervor of emotion put up his handsthrusting them into the darkness above his head and muttering wordsThe desire to say words overcame him and he said words without meaningrolling them over on his tongue and saying them because they were brave wordsfull of meaning Deathhe muttered nightthe seafearloveliness George Willard came out of the vacant lot and stood again on the sidewalk facing the housesHe felt that all of the people in the little street must be brothers and sisters to him and he wished he had the courage to call them out of their houses and to shake their hands If there were only a woman here I would take hold of her hand and we would run until we were both tired out he thought That would make me feel better With the thought of a woman in his mind he walked out of the street and went toward the house where Belle Carpenter livedHe thought she would understand his mood and that he would achieve in her presence a position he had long been wanting to achieveIn the past when he had been with her and had kissed her lips he had come away filled with anger at himselfHe had felt like one being used for some obscure purpose and had not enjoyed the feelingNow he thought he had suddenly become too big to be usedWhen George Willard got to Belle Carpenter s house there had already been a visitor there before himEd Handby had come to the door and calling Belle out of the house had tried to talk to herHe had wanted to ask the woman to come away with him and to be his wifebut when she came and stood by the door he lost his self assurance and became sullen You stay away from that kid he growledthinking of George Willardand thennot knowing what else to sayturned to go away If I catch you together I will break your bones and his too he addedThe bartender had come to woonot to threatenand was angry with himself because of his failureWhen her lover had departed Belle went indoors and ran hurriedly upstairsFrom a window at the upper part of the house she saw Ed Handby cross the street and sit down on a horse block before the house of a neighborIn the dim light the man sat motionless holding his head in his handsShe was made happy by the sight and when George Willard came to the door she greeted him effusively and hurriedly put on her hatShe thought that as she walked through the streets with young WillardEd Handby would follow and she wanted to make him sufferFor an hour Belle Carpenter and the young reporter walked about under the trees in the sweet night airGeorge Willard was full of big wordsThe sense of power that had come to him during the hour in the darkness of the alleyway remained with him and he talked boldlyswaggering along and swinging his arms aboutHe wanted to make Belle Carpenter realize that he was aware of his former weakness and that he had changed You will find me different he declaredthrusting his hands into his pockets and looking boldly into her eyes I don t know why but it is soYou have got to take me for a man or let me atoneThat s how it is Up and down the quiet streets under the new moon went the woman and the boyWhen George had finished talking they turned down a side street and went across a bridge into a path that ran up the side of a hillThe hill began at Waterworks Pond and climbed upwards to the Winesburg Fair GroundsOn the hillside grew dense bushes and small trees and among the bushes were little open spaces carpeted with long grassnow stiff and frozenAs he walked behind the woman up the hill George Willard s heart began to beat rapidly and his shoulders straightenedSuddenly he decided that Belle Carpenter was about to surrender herself to h mThe new force that had manifested itself in him had he felt been at work upon her and had led to her conquestThe thought made him half drunk with the sense of masculine powerAlthough he had been annoyed that as they walked about she had not seemed to be listening to his wordsthe fact that she had accompanied him to this place took all his doubts away It is differentEverything has become different he thought and taking hold of her shoulder turned her about and stood looking at herhis eyes shining with prideBelle Carpenter did not resist When he kissed her upon the lips she leaned heavily against him and looked over his shoulder into the darknessIn her whole attitude there was a suggestion of waitingAgainas in the alleywayGeorge Willard s mind ran off into words andholding the woman tightlyhe whispered the words into the still night Lust he whispered lust and night and women George Willard did not understand what happened to him that night on the hillsideLaterwhen he got to his own roomhe wanted to weep and then grew half insane with anger and hateHe hated Belle Carpenter and was sure that all his life he would continue to hate herOn the hill side he had led the woman to one of the little open spaces among the bushes and had dropped to his knees beside herAs in the vacant lotby the laborershouseshe had put up his hands in gratitude for the new power in himself and was waiting for the woman to speak when Ed Handby appearedThe bartender did not want to beat the boywho he thought had tried to take his woman awayHe knew that beating was unnecessarythat he had power within himself to accomplish his purpose without thatGripping George by the shoulder and pulling him to his feet he held him with one hand while he looked at Belle Carpenter seated on the grassThen with a quick wide movement of bis arm he sent the younger man sprawling away into the bushes and began to bully the womanwho had risen to her feet You re no good he said roughly I ve half a mind not to bother with youI d let you alone if I didn t want you so much On his hands and knees in the bushes George Willard stared at the scene before him and tried hard to thinkHe prepared to spring at the man who had humiliated himTo be beaten seemed infinitely better than to be thus hurled ignominiously asideThree times the young reporter sprang at Ed Handby and each time the bartendercatching him by the shoulderhurled him back into the bushesThe older man seemed prepared to keep the exercise going indefinitely but George Willard s head struck the root of a tree and he lay stillThen Ed Handby took Belle Carpenter by the arm and marched her awayGeorge heard the man and woman making their way through the bushesAs he crept down the hillside his heart was sick within himHe hated himself and he hated the fate that had brought about his humiliationWhen his mind went back to the hour alone in the alleyway he was puzzledand stopping in the darknesslistenedhoping to hear again the voiceoutside himselfthat had so short a time before put new courage into his heartWhen his way homeward led him again into the street of frame houses he could not bear the sight and began to runwanting to get quickly out of the neighborhood that now seemed to him utterly squalid and commonplaceYOU SAY YOU SAID Marianna MooreFew words are best Not hereDiscretion has been abandoned in this part of the world

well have been hammered from silver wood or carved from electrum lacquerbut la Duchesse preferred to suggest the philosophy of Evanescencetherefore her portal seemed to consist of nothing but tinsel woven into trembling shapes fruitsfringes and grotesques of all sortswith flowers and leaves of wax for brief touches of colorLa Duchesse is a curious personageShe only goes to other peoplespartiesnever to her ownshe believes that her guests enjoy themselves so much betterTherefore I was sure not to see her this eveningwhich I rather regrettedas I delight to dissectwith her supple assistance the psychologies of the various affairsdie only evidence that we allow ourselves being the scissoring and disposition of the ladiespatchesIt is a pretty gameand one that is not infrequently anticipatory even ofthe intentions of the ladies concernedFurther subtlety is not credibleAs I entered her portala cloud of boys ran forward to receive my cape and caneThey were Chinesequite nakedexcept for Pompeian wings plaited of flowersand for large black face masks which were bound across their chubby belliesOne of them conducted me to the ball roomwhere I was announcedI was the first man to arriveand I knew none of the ladies presentLa Duchesse is sometimes pleased to be delicately cruelbut she mingles sandal dust with her pepperso it was perhaps characteristic that none of her guests that evening had ever met beforeThis has its advantagesandappreciating her attitudeI bowedthe ladies accepted my introductionand signed for me to sit by them on the divanThen they were silentexcept for an occasional whisper behind the masks mounted on whips which served them for fansOne woman was clad in a wired gown of tawncovered with cadenzas of cindersHer skin was entirely the color of Bodai goldand she had stained green eyebrows in the midst of her foreheadwith lips to matchHer actual eyebrows had been pluckedHer hairI recallwas elaborately coiffured and embossedA second woman was tinted a livid lilacHer eyebrows were covered with silver lace and her lips were pastoral pinkI have forgotten her dressbut her coiffure was elaborated to suggest a white stag at restwith rough ambral beads for hoofsand tortoise combs for antlersA long tasselled pin pierced its two eyeballsThe third woman in the group was notorious for her lapses of tasteOnce she had worn the mouche moqueuse at a royal baise mainThey also say she had appeared at another party with her hair in natural blackimitating a couching catand this was thought to have been rather vulgarHoweverthe other women made a point of cultivating herfor some perverse feminine reasonThey admired her vitalityand called her a very good friendTonight her skin was shaded to suggest a blend of the Bar barish and the Cipangan bloodsIt was most tastefully doneand I realized that one of her friends must have created her toiletteto show how it might look done by some one elseHer skirt was slit in fiveone piece of which was caught uprevealing a morsel of an old rose bustle filled with sachetand then wound several times about her waist as a bodiceHer hair was azaleanShe also wore a female ruby as a mouchebut the effect was not happyBefore I had completed my inspectionthe music beganThe orchestra was entirely concealedexcept for one musician so placed that he seemed to create all the music himselfHe sat high in a solitary fretted balcony with a large lyrichordand by his postures he endeavored to express the essence of the melodiesIn this he was somewhat hampered by a full bottomed wig which reached below his waist and rather smothered him in its irridescent powderLa Duchesse told me the next week that it had been designed after the scale of the Attic masksThe hall was selectedly filled by this time with an adequate number of dancerswho mingled as they pleasedOften one saw the partners of two men leave them to dance with each otherthus forcing the two men by the laws of etiquette to dance togetherBut the dances themselves were a noveltyfor by a tacit consent the entire company had abandoned dancing the dances to their proper melodiesas being rather obviousSowhen a Sara bande was soundeda nervous Courante fluttered through the hall to the tune of a Pavane was danced a GavotteYet the dancers 24 The Little Review kept time to the music with a curious perfectionand the ladies

they lifted the faded mountainous lidthousands of live oyster crabs appearedscrambling out and hastening in all directionsEach one had a Persian scene painted on his backIt was very amusing to catch and eat themand the confusion of the ladies was deliciousMany of the crabs drowned themselves in the wineSome were found later concealed in snuffboxespantouflesand the cartouches Others crawled up the candlesbut therealas they met a flaming death instead of the curtained aqueous life they soughtAfter this coursethere was a pauseduring which three powdered pages carried about a large funereal urn in silenceNone understood this save cue old lady frilled in cockatoo grey and monkey greenwho told everybody that it was an antique custom out of EgyptNow we were ready for the last courseThis proved to be dishes of dwarfed peacocks chained to their perchesTheir tails had been plucked out and bunches of natural grapes hung thereIt was a very pleasant conceit to gather these grapes from the living birdsTheir tongues had been cut out and silver whistles thrust down their throatsso that they made a most melodious frisson during the entire courseTo this musicacrobats depicted a pretty storyAfter supper I felt fatigued of dancingso I wandered to the gaming roomwhere there was some gambling in masksBut in the obscurer half of the hall they were frolickingThey were playing La BalancoireLa SeringueHop ome ThumbTaste and DieLondon Bridgeand anything else they could rememberI entered into the circle of L Indifferentand enjoyed myself lustily at the fruitless efforts of the ladiesI was actually about to be sceptered as Kingwhen sudden arpeggios of rockets announced something unusualAll the games stopped at once in the excitementBut the Dutch cavalry had not been capturedneither had the Boeotian fleet broken throughLa Duchesseeccentric as ever had decided to returnand thus it was that she announced her arrivalHer crueltiesas I have saidare rarebut she likes their flavorImmediately the party shatteredHalf the dancers fled without chaise or chariotso much they feared herI would have stayedbut that I knew a mood was on herMoreover the dawn was in full choirI lingered long enough to get my cape and caneto rescue a sprig of decorationand to look for a lady that had pleased mebut I was too lateand all by myself I stepped through an irregular postern into the

leisureShe thought it charming to think and speak of her most Delicate vices in the presence of square shouldered Lusty menmen of thick necks and thighsand upper armsMen whose jaws and forheads are

hidden faces of the buildings and the air was silvered with whirling linesThrough the sparkle and fume of the rain colored night the lights of the cafe signs burned like golden lettered banners flung stiffly into the stormAbout these lights floated patches of yellow mist through which the rain swarmed in flurries of little gleaming mothsThere were also the lights of the doors and windows beneath the burning signsThey too exhaled oblongs of yellow steam upon the darknessThe remainder of the street was lost in a wilderness of rain that bubbled and raced over its stone in an endless and bewildering detonationI had been in this street before and I knew it for a street of little grimy fronted cafe and vicious haunts crude and rococo gathering places for niggersprostitutes and loutsBut now as I walked with my shoes spurting water and the rain hanging from my clothesthere was about this street a curious unfamiliarityThe fuming motionless rain filled the air with a mysterious presenceBeneath my feet ran the silver tipped pool of the flooded pavementGleaming in its rain splintered depths swam the reflections of the burning lamps overheadTheseas I walkedwere the yellow script of another and wraith like world staring up at me out of nowhereThe rest was darkness and billowy stripes of waterI hurried on as the sound of thunder crawled out of the skyA vein of lightning opened the night and in the sudden blue pallor the street and its buildings etched themselves on the vanishing lighta monstrous and phosphorescent worldThe ram flung itself for an instant in great opalescent sheets cut of the lighted spacesI caught a glimpse of a figure in the distancehunched and stationaryThe darkness and the desolate whirl of the rain resumed and I walked on staring as after something vanishedA wind now entered the streetoutlining itself in the wild undulations of the rain on the pavementsClandestine notions held rendezvous in my thought as I pressed forward against the stormDecidedly the street had an unfamiliar air and was full of dishevelled rain ghostsThe best of philosophers become wet in the rainThe roar of the flooded nightthe leap and hollow blaze of the lightningthe sudden inanimate burst of pale violet outline in the chaotic darkwere things which seemingly isolated me from the normal contemplations which are my habitI began to fancy myselfin this dilapidated storm ridden streetas some tiny wanderer through a strange and tortuous worldThe little windows that trickled their yellow lights toward me seemed the glowing pasteboards of some forgotten illusionWhat with the stumble of thunder in the dark and the tenacious lash of the raina burn had come into my bodyI was moving prosaically enough toward the house of a friendHe had offered for my inspection several manuscripts purchased that day and scrawled with diverting cryptogramsIn a pocket tucked dry and safe out of the wet I was carrying the work of a profound Englishman who had devoted his life to the unraveling of cryptogramsBut now the churning of the wind and rainthe noise and the phosphorescent gulfs of light into which I was continually plunginghad brought me an intoxication in which manuscripts and friends and cryptograms seemed miserable thingsI drew in with gulps the quickening odor of the storm the spice of water laden windsI had felt at first a proper regard for my clothesa philosophical emotion which had gradually given way to relish of the stormThis in turnas I moved on leaning against the wind and the pliant walls of waterwas succeeded by an elation groundless and insaneThe little adjectives I had been arranging for my lonely delight were seized by an incoherenceI began to ponder upon violent abstractionsand the thought of the routine ways of life became to me unbearableThe innumerable little meditations with which I usually beguile my solitary journeys offended this new reach of my spiritI went plunging onsoaked and disheveledcurbing a desire to shout and dash aboutMoving thus through the storm my thought became full of the tremblings of a dancer stiffened by thebeat of furious musicWhat were not possibleStrangeirrational expectations left me smiling faintlyBut the wild dance of the windthe halloo of the night and the vast burst of water about me urged me on despite this snobbery with which all good logicians regard their emotionsHow gladly we surrender our treasured philosophies at the first touch of ecstasyWhere and of what avail were the intrigues of reason in the hammering of night like this a night for poets and mysticstrue fellows of all stormsWhat strange altar fires were those engulfing flickers of dead moonlightA racket of what Gods were those bounding soundsThus my thought continued to spurn the little tracks of reason and circle in the profound and mystic abstraction of the wanderer in stormsThe night was growing wilderMy eyes straining toward unimagined things bored into the vapors and steam of the rainWhereon a blinding gust of light brought me shuddering to a haltThe thunder filled the night suddenly with an amazing tumulthorror of soundand I remained stiff and staring as in a dream at a face that floated in a piercing lightI stood as one suspended in the rushing of windsThe worldbut for this face which confronted mehad vanishedI saw it to be the face of a woman contorted into a stark and indescribable grimace of raptureIts eyes gleamed like black and lavender tips of flameIts teeth stood out white and skull like against the red of an opened mouthI was aware of a sound of laughter that seemed to come floating out of the roaring spaces about meA silence and darkness seized the worldI stood listening to themelodious detonations of the rain and the harmless sweep of the windOver my head burned a cafe sign and I was gazing into a washed and emptied panel of glassWithin I saw figures jerking about in a dance and an orchestra of niggers playingThe yellow script overhead proclaimed me in the presence of the Yellow GoatIn the home of my friend it was quiet and cheerfulOutside the rain chattered in the darkness and the alto of the wind arose in long organ notes from the housesWe sat and smoked and exchanged elaborate phrasesBut my eyes had evidently been affected by the lightningWhen I closed them they still revealed to me the instant of piercing light and the face floating under the sign of the Yellow GoatSeen thus in memory there was an irritating familiarity about its featuresI had not intended tobut I found myself after several moments telling my friend of the incidentI spoke with a great show of incorruptable logic of the thingpointing out that what I had seen had been undoubtedly the face of an uncommonly beautiful prostitute surprised in a yawn by the gulp of lightningBut my friend is a creature given to making vast and melodramatic riddles out of such phenomenaand he differed with me Stuff and nonsence I finally interrupted him If you ll stop quoting the Cabala and cease your chattering about Sabbats and witches I ll discuss the thing with you as befits two civilized men He stared with a faint smile at his shelves of books that like erratic and colored teeth stood out from the wallI resumed There was the face of a dancer whom I watched one evening on the stageI remember now a curious gleam in her eyes and recall how I tried vainly to fit an emotion to such a gleamThere was the face of a hatless boy running through the streetsone sunny morning who bumped into me and dashed on without begging my pardonThere was the face of a man I listened to once as he played the violinand I remember too the face of a woman that I hesitated to kissNow the face I saw in the lightning reminded me of all these faces and of some others I have forgottenYou knowabout faces there is often something curiousThese faces I now remember possessed an identical contortionan identical arrangement of features and somehow an expression identical to the one I have just told you ofStark and unhumanA furious and 32 The Little Review repulsive lovelinessIt was gone in an instantBut I saw it so vividly that I see it now when I close my eyesan insufferable gesture thrust out of the lightningThe faces of which I am reminded were not so definiteBut they had the same light about themI know the light you mean said my friend I ve noted it myselfIf you watch closely you will catch an instant of it now and then shining through the grimace of a dancer or of a man laughingoras you sayplaying the violin He paused and his face became full of a curious sincerity Or of a woman in passionYesI know what you meanDark and violent legends have been written about this lightfor it has always been in the world and yet seemingly not of itIn demonologyAgain I offered interruption Let us not talk of demonologyInasmuch as a demon is something which must by logic be something unimaginable any adjectives we may arrange concerning it will be crude and futileWhat I saw in the face in the storm I ve seen before and in places without stormI ve put it down as a maniacal gleamthe indication of a fugitive disorder of the brainI ve noticed vaguely that the expression is somehow connected with people in moments of inspirationI recall a young poet I knewHis stare at times became like a wild laugh out of which mirth has passed and which has become full of something elseThis phrase vastly exaggerated would describe the expression of the features I looked at tonightI left my friend with the emotion of a man who has offended his own intelligenceThis babbling over the face of a prostitute passed in the rain appealed to me as the vaporings of a weakened brainYet it pursued meI found myself excitedly searching in the faces of the little half dead who swarmed the streetswho rode in carswho sat in restaurantsThere were impressions I could not shake off by assuring myself of an innate idiocyAnd therefore three nights later I jammed a cap over my ears and with the collar of my mackintosh properly raised I launched myself into another night lashed with wind and rain in quest of the Yellow GoatI was curiously nervous as I turned into the street of the grimy fronted cafesHere was again halloo of that other nightthe golden lettered street signs adrift in the stormthe vast wash of water illuminating the dark with its fugitive glintthe boiling pavements and the odor of wet windsI pressed on hoping for the lightning and the thunderForI assured myselfthe quest demanded a certain footlighting to be realand off stage noisesBut the darknessswollen with rain and windremained unrelieved and thus the morbid sanity of my true philosophical nature arose in my thought to confuse me and to prepare me for disillusionsI would find no such faceIn fact the face did not existIt had been the trick of lightning and jumbled nervesAnd those other faces which I so obligingly remembered auxiliary hallucinations all of themIn anyevent promenadingon a night like this savored of idiocyface or no faceThe quest of mysteries indeedThe urge of spiritual hungersto be sureBehold a solemn ass walkingas was his privilegethrough a pneumonia breeding deluge The wind bayed through the streets and the rain enveloped me in its monotonous rushStaring ahead I saw gleaming in a little floating oasis of bright mist the sign of the Yellow GoatThere was magic in the signThe promptings of sanity fled my thought and an exultation tangled my legsAfter all there were destinations in the cityThere were the veils of Isis stilland the piles of stone that little hands reared had not lost their cunning to conceal unimaginable mysteriesI paused before the entrance of the Yellow Goat as the streaming door swung open and two figures darted outThey were by me and gone in an instant andas if in pursuit of themrushed a rollicking lurch of soundInto the night floated a strain of music and the laugh of a womanI entered the Yellow Goat and the night vanished behind meI was suddenly in a strange world of lights and shouts and odorsDancing bodies spun and jerked among the tablesFaces bounced amid layers of tobacco smoke that lay in undulent lavender Sheets above the floorThrough streaks of color and movement came the bray of music a melody leaping between the smash of trombones and the bursting staccato of drumsFive niggers with faces satin black were swaying over silver instruments and shouting as they playedAmong the round topped table the revels and contortions of the dancers threatened to annihilate all furnitureA waiter passed in front of me balancing a black tray laden with colored glassesAt the tables sat men and women with faces that seemed somehow out of focusniggersprostitutesloutsThe slant of red mouths opened with laughterthe movement of eyes and hands and white throats of womenthese I saw as fragments through a mistI moved through the halloo of the room toward a table that seemed to me emptyThe reek of wine and steaming clothsthe sting of perspiring perfumesthe bedroom odors of women s bodies dizzied me as I dropped into a chair at this tableOpposite me sat a woman with a face cut out of scarletwhite and lavender cardboardsHer head was thrown back in a grimace of violent laughterThe red flesh of her opened mouth and throat stared at me behind the roll of sound that issuedI was conscious for the moment of being embraced by soft arms and I felt the hot and opened mouth pressing almost on my faceAbout me men were banging glasses on the table and women were screaming laughtersTo the music of the five shouting niggers couples were making feverish gestures with their bodies against the roar and haze of the roomThe faces of drunken niggersprostitutes and louts hung in the odor and smokeI sat silent like some bewildered and forbidding strangerwondering how this woman had appeared so abruptly opposite meI was in these first moments walking again through the storm and beholding in a gulp of lightning the strange features of a woman behind the door of the Yellow GoatThe music of the five niggers stopped and a sudden emptiness flooded the roomThe confusion became a matter of men s and women s voices and scurrying waitersThe woman opposite me alone remained unchangedShe was gazing at me with eyes in whose swarthy depths moved tiny streaks of scarlet that were like wavering flame tipsBeneath her eyes her skin was darkened as if by bruisesA peculiarly sultry light glowed over their heavy discolorationsHer mouth had shut and her cheeks were without curvesfollowing the corpse like lines of her skullThey were paper whitebut again I noted in them the curious sultry glow of her smeared and heavy eyesHer lips were like the streaks of vermilion laquer painted on an idol s faceShe had thrust two bared arms across the table top and was leaning forwardShe was regarding me with a smileTo this extent am I able to describe herThe face of a malignant pierrette or of a diabolic clownstark and illumined as under some strong lavender raythe gleaming and putrescent eyes haloed in a gelatinous mistfull of reptilian sorceryThese are simple things to recountBut these were merely the mask for a bewildering thing which held me silent in a strange inertiaThis thing hovered between us like a third personIt was an animation creating waves in the air that were neither of light nor of soundMy thought grew d m andduring these moments that I sat returning her smilean almost unbearable lust cried in my bloodWe arose and walked arm and arm out of the Yellow Goat into the night and rainI was aware of faces turned toward me as we passed among the tables but they seemed the fragments of a foreign worldIn the rain her body breathed against mewarming me with its hot fleshMy thought became like an echo forever escaping meThe woman tugged at my arm RunRun she criedShe threw her head back and filled the night with her laughWe ranWe came breathless up a flight of stairs into a room lighted with a gas jetThe heavy sulphurous scent of tube roses stuffed the place but I could make out no flowersI stood against the door we had enteredThe woman s clothes had fallen from her as if blown from her body by a strong windNude but for the black silken stockings she had not removed she turned toward meHer white skin glistened with moisture and was covered in places with the faint colors of stained glassShe began to dance and throw her arms about and her mouth opened in a riveted laughThe room became saturated with herShe swept by me plunging about in her danceposturing and shoutingThe gleam of her eyes buried itself in my brain and left me crazed with desire for herIt was this gleam and the rapturous grimacings of her face that awakened my thoughtI recalled as from a distance that I had come in quest of somethingThis thing I saw now in her face as she tumbled about the malodorous roomIt expressed tortureI had seen this light that burned from herthis curious contortion of feature in the faces of the citynow for an instant in the inspiration of a dancernow in the midst of a violin s wondernow in the joy of a woman laughingI had never seen it as I saw it nowbut always as a fugitive and lunatic light that fixed itself upon the air after it had vanished from the eyes of men and womanHere was this light in a nudity more intimate than the shine and odor of her body s fleshShe had ceased her dancing and thrown herself upon the grimy rumpled surface of a bedHer laughter also had ceasedShe lay with her arms extended toward meher nakedness moving faintly like some thick white and undulant reptileI saw that her eyes were closed but that there was nevertheless about her the stare of a terrible visionA moan began to come from her and her fingers like claws scratched at the airHer moving and the odors arising from her grew unendurableI opened the door softly and ranPursuing me came the sound of laughterrising in a howlOutside it still rainedThe wind no longer blewI hurried away and my thought so long tangled in emotion began to unwind itself She is a disease I murmured to myself Her flesh is insaneShe is the secret of ecstasy and of Gods and of all things that are beautiful About my feet the whirling lines of the rain burst upon the pavement forming innumerable little vsIn the proper course of time I would fashion adjectives out of the thing the woman of the Yellow Goat had revealed to me and thus perhaps add to the progress of my raceBut now there drifted before me a white torsoed phantom and in my nose there remained the hot smell of a decayAutoepitaph I have played always Myself And played myself Not always Perfectly Is it enough for the exclamation At the endQualis artifex pereoTHE LAMENT OF WOMEN Djuna

thenexcept in a subconscious mannerwhich might never have risen to the full life of consciousness had not my abnormal contact with the hero of this story been prolongedIn this very first scene of our introduction senor de Aretal began by way of welcome to exhibit the translucent strings of opalsamethystsemeralds and carbuncles which constituted his intimate treasureIn a first moment of dazzlernent I spread myself outI opened myself completely like a great white sheetin order to make greater my surface of contract with the generous giverThe antennae of my soul went outfelt him and returnedtremulousmoveddelighted to give me the good news This is the man you awaitedthis is the man in search of whom you peered into all unknown soulsfor your intuition had affirmed to youlong since that some day you would be enriched by the advent of a unique beingThe avidity with which you have seiezdstared into and cast aside so many sousl which made themselves desired and deceived your hope shall today be amply satisfiedstoop and drink of this water And when he arose to goI followed himtied and a captive like the lamb which the shepherdess bound with garlands of rosesOnce in the living room of my new friendhaving no more than crossed the threshold which gave him passage to a propitious and habitual environmenthis entire person burst into flameHe became dazzlingpicturesque as the horse of an emperor in a military paradeThe skirts of his coat had a vague resemblance to the inner tunic of a steed of the middle ages harnassed for a tourneyThey fell below his meager buttockscaressing his fine and distinguished thighsAnd his theatrical performance beganAfter a ritual of preparation carefully observedknight initiate of a most ancient cult and when our souls had already become concave he brought forth his folio of verses with the unctious deportment of a priest who draws near the altarHe was so grave that he imposed respectA laugh would have been put to the knife in the instant of its birthHe drew forth his first string of topazesor better saidhis first series of strings of topazestranslucent and brilliantHis hands were raised with such cadence that the rhythm extended three worlds removedBy the power of the rhythm our room was moved entire to the second floorlike a captive baloonuntil it broke free from its earthly ties and carried us on a silent aerial journeyBut I was not won by his verses for they were inorganicThey were the translucid and radiant soul of mineralsthey were the symmetrical and flinty soul of mineralsAnd then the officiant of mineral tilings brought forth his second necklaceOh emeraldsdivine emeraldsAnd he showed the thirdOh diamondsclear diamondsAnd he broughtthe fourth and the fifthwhich were again topazes like drops of lightwith accumlations from the sunwith parts opaquely radiantAnd then the seventhhis carbunclesHis carbuncles were almost warmthey nearly moved me as might pomegranate seeds or theblood of herosbut I touched them and I felt them hardBy every means the soul of mineral things invaded methat inorganic aristocracy seduced me strangelywithout my fully comprehendingSo much was this true that I could not translate the words of my inner master who was confused and made a vain effort to become hard and symmetrical and limited and brilliantI remained dumbAnd thenin an unforseen explosion of offended dignitybelieving himself deceivedthe officiant took from me his necklace of carbuncles with a movement so full of violence but so just that it left me more perplexed than hurtIf it had been he of the roses he would not have acted in this wayAnd thenas upon the breaking of a charm by that act of violencethe enchantment of the rhythm was shatteredand the little white boat in which we had been flying through the blue of the sky found itself solidly planted on the first floor of the houseLaterour mutual friendsenor de Aretal and I lunched together on the lower floor of the hotelIn these moments I looked into the well of the soul of the master of the topazesI saw many things reflecedAs I looked in I had instinctively spread my peacock s tailbut I had spread it without an inner sense of the thingsimply urged by so much beauty perceived and desiring to show my best aspect in order to place myself in tone with itOh the things I saw in that wellThe well was for me the very well of mystery itselfTo look into a human soulwide open as a wellwhich is an eye of the earthis the same thing as to get a glimpse of GodWe never can see the bottomBut we saturate ourselves in the moisture of the waterthe great vehicle of loveand we are bedazzled with reflected lightThis well reflected the multiple external aspect of things in the very manner of senor de AretalCertain figures showed more clearly than others on the surface of the waterthere were reflected the classicsthat treasure of tenderness and wisdomthe classicsbut above all there was reflected the image of an absent friend with such purity of line and such exact coloring that the fact that this parallel should give me knowledge of the soul of el senor de la Rosathe absent friend so admired and so lovedwas not one of the least interesting attractions which the soul of senor de Aretal possessed for meAbove all else there was reflected GodGodfrom whom I was never less distantThe great soul which for a time is brought into focusI understood as I looked into the well of senor de Aretal that he was a divine messengerHe brought a message to humanitythe human messagewhich has the greatest value of allBut he was an unconscious messengerHe lavished good but he had it not in his possessionSoon I interested my noble host to an unusual degreeI leant over the clear water of his spirit with such avidity that he was enabled to get a clear likeness of meI had drawn sufficiently near and besides I was in addition a clear thing which did not intercept the lightPossibly I obscured him as much as he did meIt is a quality of things brought under hallucination to be in their turn hallucinatorsThis mutual attraction drew us together and brought us into intimate relationshipI frequented the divine temple of that beautiful soulAt its contact I began to take fireSenor de Aretal was a lighted lamp and I was stuff ready to burnOur souls communicated with each otherI held my hands extended and the soul of each one of my ten fingers was an antenna through which I received the knowledge of the soul of senor de AretalThus I became aware of many things unknown beforeThrough aerial routes what else are the fingersor velvety leavesfor what else but aerial routes are the leaves I received something from that man which had been lacking me till that timeI had been an adventurous shrub which prolongs its filiments until it finds the necessary humus in new earthAnd how I fedI fed with the joy of tremulous leaves of chlorafile that spread themselves to the sunwith the joy with which a root encounters a decomposing corpsewiththe joy with which convalescents take their vascillating steps in the light flooded mornings of springwith the joy with which a child clings to the nutritious breast and afterwardbeing fullsmiles in his dreams at the vision of a snowy udderBahall things which complete themselves have had that joyGodsome daywill be nothing more than a food for ussomething needed for our lifeThus smile children and the young when they feel themselves gratified by nutritionBeyond that I took fireNutrition is combustionWho knows what divine child shook over my spirit a sprinkling of gunpowderof naphthaof something easily inflammableand senor de Aretalwho had known how to draw near mehad set fire to itI had the pleasure of burningthat is to sayof fulfilling my destinyI understood that I was a thing easily inflammableOh father fireblessed be thouMy destiny is to burnFire is also a messageWhat other souls will take fire from meTo whom would I communicate my flameBahwho can fortell the future of a sparkI burnt and senor de Aretal saw me burnIn marvelous harmony our two atoms of hydrogen and oxygen had approached so closely thatstretching themselvesthrowing out particlesthey almost succeeded in uniting into a living thingAt times they fluttered about like two butterflies which seek each other and makemarvelous loops over the river and in the airAt other times they rose by virtue of their own rhythm and harmonious consonanceas rise the two wings of a distichOne was impregnating the otherUntilHave you heard of those icebergs whichdrawn into warm waters by a submarine currentdisintegrate at their base untilthe marvelous equilibrium being lostthey revolve upon themselves in an apocalyptic turningrapidunforseenpresenting to the face of the sun what had before been hidden beneath the seaInverted they appear unconscious of the ships whichwhen their upper part went underthey caused to sink into the abyssUnconscious of the loss of nests which had been built in their parts heretofore turned to the lightin the relative stability of those two fragile thingseggs and iceThussuddenlythere began to take shape in the transparent angel of senor de Aretal a dark little almost insubstantial cloudIt was the projected shadow of the horse that was drawing nearWho could express my grief when there appeared in the angel of senor de Aretal that thing obscurevague and formlessMy noble friend had gone down to the bar of the hotel in which he livedWho was passingBaha dark thing possessed of a horrible flattened nose and thin lipsDo you understandIf the line of the nose had been straight then also something would have been straightened in his soulIf his lips had been fullhis sincerity would have been increased alsoBut noSenor de Aretal had called himThere he was And my soul which at that instant had power to discern clearly understood that that dwarf whom I had until then thought to be a mansince I one day saw his cheeks color with shamewas no more than a pygmyWith such nostrils one could not be sincereInvited by the master of the topazes we seated ourselves at a tableThey served us cognac and refreshments to take or leaveHere the harmony was brokenThe alcohol broke itI did not take anyHe drankBut the alcohol was near me on the white marble tableIt came between us and intercepted our souls Furthermorethe soul of senor de Aretal was no longer blue like mineIt was red and flat like that of the companion who separated usThen I understood that what I had most loved in senor de Aretal was my own blueSoon the flattened soul of senor de Aretal began to speak of low thingsAll his thoughts had the crooked noseAll his thoughts drank alcohol and materialized grosslyHe told us of a legion of Jamaican negresseslewd and semi nakedpursuing him with the offer of their odious merchandise for a nickelHis speech pained me and soon his will pained meHe asked me insistently to drink alcoholI yieldedBut hardly had my sacrifice been consummated than I felt clearly that something was breaking between usThat our inner masters were withdrawing and that a divine equilibrium of crystals was tumbling down in silenceI told him soSenor de Aretal you have broken our divine relationship in this very instantTomorrow you will see me arrive at your apartmenta man onlyand I will meet only a man in youIn this very instant you have dyed me in redThe following day in effectI do not know what we didsenor de Aretal and II believe we were walking along the street bent upon some sort of businessHe was aga n ablazeI was walking at his side extinguished and far removedAs I walked I was thinking to myself that mystery had never opened so wide a slit for me to look through as in my relations with my strange fellow voyagerI had never felt so thoroughly the possibilities of manI had never so well understood the intimate God as in my relations with senor de AretalWe arrived at his roomHis forms of thought were awaiting usAnd all the while I felt myself far from senor de AretalI felt far for many dayson many successive visitsI went to him obeying inexorable lawsBecause precisely that contact was required to consume a part in meso dry until thenas if prepared the better to burnAll my pain of dryness hitherto now rejoiced in Burningall the pain of my emptiness hitherto now rejoiced in fullnessI sallied out of the night of my soul into a blazing dawnIt is wellLet us be braveThe dryer we are the better we shall burnAnd so I went to that man and our inner masters rejoicedAhbut the enchantment of the first daysNow whereWhen I had become resigned to find a man in senor de Aretalthere returned anew the enchantment of his marvelous presenceI loved my friendBut it was impossible for me to throw aside the melancholy of the departed godTransluciddiamantine lost wingsHow might I recover them and return where we wereOne day senor de Aretal found the medium propitiousWe his hearers were severalverses were being recited in the room enchanted by his habitual creationsSuddenlyin the presence of some more beautiful than the restas upon a horn blastour noble host arose pawing and prancingAnd then and there I had my first visionSenor de Aretal stretched his neck like a horseI attracted his attentionWorthy hostI beg you to take this and this attitudeYesit was truehe stretched his neck like a horseLaterthe second visionthe same dayWe went out to walkOf a sudden I perceivedI perceived itSenor de Aretal fell like a horseSuddenly his left foot gave waythen his haunches nearly touched the groundlike a horse that stumblesHe recovered himself quicklybut he had already given me the impressionHave you seen a horse fallThen the third visiona few days laterSenor de Aretal was performingseated before his money in goldsuddenly I saw him move his arms as horses of pure blood move their forefeetthrusting the extremities of their legs forwardto either sidein that beautiful series of movements which you doubtless have many times observed when an able rider in a crowded thoroughfare curbs the pace of his curvetting and splendid mountAfterward another visionSenor de Aretal looked at things like a horseWhen he was drunk with his own wordsas his own generous blood makes a high bred steed drunktremulous as a leaftrembling like a steed mounted and curbedtrembling like all living forms of nervous and fine fiber he would bend down his headhe would turn his head sidewiseand thus he looked aboutwhile his arms knitted something in the airlike the forepaws of a horseWhat a magnificent thing a horse isHe almost stands upon two feetAnd then I felt that the spirit was riding himAnd later a hundred visions moreSenor de Aretal approached women like a horseIn sumptuous parlors he could not remain quietHe would draw alongside some lovely womannewly introducedwith elastic and easy movementsbow his head and hold it on the sidehe would take a turn around her and take a turn around the roomThus he looked sidelongI was able to observe that his eyes were bloodshotOne day he broke one of the small vessels which color them with a delicate networkthe little vessel broke and a tiny red stain colored his scleraI called it to his attention Bah said he to me that is an old matterI have suffered with it for three daysBut have no time to see a doctor He walked to a glass and looked into it fixedlyWhen I returned on the following dayI found that one more virtue ennobled himI asked him What beautifies you in this hour And he replied A hue And he told me that he had put on a red necktie that im might harmonise with his eyeThen I understood that there was in hisspirit a third red and that these three reds together were what had attracted my attention when saluting himFor the crystal spirit of senor de Aretal was wont to take on the hue of surrounding thingsAnd this is what his verses werea marvelous collection of crystals tinged by the things about thememeraldsrubiesopalsBut this was at times sad because at times surrounding things were dark or discoloredthe greens of the manure pilethe pale greens of sickly plantsI came to deplore finding him with others and when this happened I would leave senor de Aretal under any pretext if his companion were not a person of clear colorsFor unfailingly senor de Aretal reflected the spirit of his companionOne day I found himhe the noble steeddwarfed and honeyedAnd as in a mirrorI saw in the room a person dwarfed and honeyedSure enoughthere she washe presented herA woman flattenedfat and lowHer spirit likewise was a low thingSomething trailing and humblebut inoffensive and desirous of pleasingThat person was the spirit of flatteryAnd senor de Aretal also at that moment possessed a small soulservile and obsequiousWhat convex mirror has brought about this horrible transformationI asked myselfterrifiedAnd at once all the air of the room appeared to me as a transparent convex glass which distorted the objectsHow flattened the chairs wereEverything offered itself to be sat uponAretal was one hack horse the moreOn another occasionat the table of a noisy group which laughed and drankAretal was one human the moreone more of the heapI drew alongside him and saw him listed and the price fixedHe cracked jokes and brandished them like weapons of defenseHe was a circus horseAll in that group were on exhibitionAnother time he was a jayanHe entangled himself in abusive words with a brute of a manHe was like a market womanHe would have disgusted mebut I loved him so much that it made me sadHe was a kicking horseFinally there appeared on the physical plane a question which I had long been shapingwhich is the true spirit of senor de AretalAnd I answered it quicklySenor de Aretal with his fine mentality had no soulhe was amoralHe was amoral as a horse and allowed himself to be mounted by any spirit whateverAt times his riders were fearful or miserly and then Senor de Aretal would fling them from him with a proud buckThat moral vacuum of his being wouTd fillas do all vacuumswith easeIt tended to fill itselfI proposed the question to the very exalted mind of my friend and he took it up at onceHe made me a confessionYesit is trueI show you who love me the better part of meI show you my inner godButit is painful to say itbetween two human beings around me I tend to take on the color of the lowerFlee from me when I am in bad companyUpon the base of this discovery I entered still more deeply into his spiritHe confessed to me one dayin griefthat no woman had ever loved himAll his being bled as he said thisI explained to him that no woman could love himbecause he was not a manthe union would have been monstrousSenor de Aretal did not know modesty and was indelicate in his relations with ladieslike an animalAnd heBut I heap them with moneyThat also would be given them by a valuable property rentedAnd heBut I caress them with passionTheir little wooly dogs also lick their handsAnd heBut I am faithful and generous to themI am humble to themI am self denying to themWellman is more than thatButdo you love themYesI love themBut do you love them as a manNofriendnoYou break in those delicate and divine beings a thousand slender cords which constitute a life entireThat last prostitutewho denied you her love and has disdained your moneydefended her one inviolate parther inner masterthat which is not soldYou have no shameNow listen to my prophesya woman will redeem youYouobsequious and humble to lowliness with the ladiesyou proud to carry a lovely womanon your backwith the pride of the favorite nag which delights in its burdenwhen this beautiful woman shall love youyou will be redeemedyou will acquire chastity by conquestAnd at another time propitious for confidencesI have never had a friendAnd his entire being bled as he said thisI explained to him that no man could give him his friendshp because he was not a manand the friendship would have been monstrousSenor de Aretal did not comprehend friendship and was indelicate in his relations with menlike an animalHe knew only comradshipHe galloped joyful and openhearted upon the plain with his companionshe liked to go in droves with themprimitive and primordial he gallopedfeeling the burning of his generous blood which incited him to actionbecoming drunk with the airthe verdure and the sunbut later he would withdraw with indifference from his companion of a yearThe horsehis brother dead beside himsees him rot beneath the dome of the heavens without a tear rising to his eyesAnd senor de Aretalwhen I had finished expressing my last conceptradiantThis is the glory of natureMatterimmortaldoes not dieWhy weep for a horse when a rose remainsWhy weep for a rose when a bird is thereWhy lament for a friend when a meadow remainsI feel the radiant light of the sun which possesses us allwhich redeems us allTo weep is to sin against the sunMencowardsmiserable and lowsin against naturewhich is GodAnd Ireverenton my knees before that beautiful animal soul which filled me with the unction of GodYesit is truebut man is a part of naturehe is nature evolvedI respect evolutionThere is force and there is matterI respect them bothThey are all oneI am beyond the moralYou are on this side of moralityyou are below the moralBut the horse and the angel touch one anotherand for this reason you at times appear to me as divineStFrancis d Assisilike youloved all beings and all thingsbut that being truehe loved them in another mannerhe loved them beyond the circlenot this side of it as you doAnd then heI am generous with my friendsI shower them with goldIt would also be given them by a valuable property leasedor by an oil wellor a working mineAnd heBut I pay them a thousand little attentionsI have been nurse to the sick friend and a boon companion in an orgy to the hale friendAnd IMan is more than thatman is solidarityYou love your friends but do you love them with human loveNoyou offended in us a thousand intangible thingsIwho am the first man who has loved youhave sown the germ of your redemptionThat egoistic friend who separated himselfin leaving youfrom a benefactordid not feel himself united to you by any human bondYou have no solidarity with menYou have not modesty with women nor solidarity with men nor respect for the lawYou lieand find in your exalted mentality an excuse for your liealthough you are by nature truthfullikehorseYou flatter and deceive and find in your exalted mentality an excuse for your flattery and your deceit although you are by nature noblelike a horseI have never so loved horses as I love them in youI understand the nobility of the horseit is nearly humanYou have always borne a human load upon your backa womana friend What would become of that woman and that friend in the difficult passes without youthe noblethe strongwho bore them upon himself with a generosity which will be your redemptionHe who bears a burden covers the road most swiftlyBut you have borne them like a horseFaithful to your naturebegin to bear them like a manI took leave of the master of the topazes and a few days later there occured the last act of our relationshipOf a sudden senor de Aretal sensed that my hand was unsteadythat it was held out to him in a cowardly and ungenerous manner and his nobility of the brute revoltedWith a swift kick he threw me far from himI felt his hoofs on my foreheadThen a rapid galloprhythmic andmartialscattering to the winds the sands of the desertI turned my eyes toward the place where the sphynx had stood in her eternal repose of mystery and I no longer saw herThe sphynx was senor de Aretal who had revealed to me his secret which was the same as that of the centaurIt was senor de Aretaldrawing away at a rapid gallopwith a human face and the body of a beastGuatemalaOctober 1914THE BOULEVARD Israel Solon ALL THE morning Mollie Mandel had been from door to door along the south side of Maxwell Streetselling tickets for The Orphans Aid Society s coming ballHer hand bag of real alligator skin with solid gold trimming bulged with all the money she had stuffed into it that morningThere was resounding firmness in her step and arrogance in her mannerNot another member of the Entertainment Committee had sold so many ticketsshe was just certainMollie Mandel enjoyed all sellingBefore marrying the rich Max MandelMollie had been the best sales lady in Little Jake s Milwaukee Avenue Bargain HouseBut it was selling tickets for fashionable charities that Mollie Mandel enjoyed mostIt made her welfare work among the ghetto poor a real pleasureMollie Mandel smiled a fat smileShe was uncommonly well pleased with herself and her success of the morningShe unbuttoned her Persian lamb coat that everybody might enjoy the snug broadcloth suit she wore beneathand the diamonds flashing at her throat and earsThe barrels of herringthe numerous improvised shops and stands that congested the sidewalk and streetthe pyramids of discolored orangesdiminutive apples and over ripe bananasthe heaps of cheap imitation wares exhibited for sale to those living on the outer edgeheightened her feeling of securityAnd she reveled in itShe was above these little people and their trembling livesLet those who give themselves superior airs snarl at her as they pleaseand call herallrightnik which is the American Yiddish for New rich vulgarianWhat did she careIn Maxwell Street she was a swell lady what lives on the BoulevardShe was so well pleased with herself that she quite forgot her luncheonMollie Mandel rarely forgot her mealsIt was noon when Mollie Mandel caught sight of Esther Mal kin at the show window in her father s bake shop in Maxwell 54 The Little Review StreetInstantlyher eyes swam in pleasurejoy oozed out all over her faceguttered down each side of her nose and around her mouthspilled over the edge of her jawscircled the fat of her neck and throat and ran down below her broadcloth suit SayFrieda Mollie Mandel shouted to her companion across the street Come on over And she made violent motions with her handsWhat s eatinyou now Frieda shouted back as she hurried across Listen Mollie Mandel confided in a loud whisper See Esther Malkin moping there in the windowI ve got a live hunchI m going to hook the Malkins for some ticketsIll just bet you the lunch for the two of us at the Annex you don tSay that again Mollie Mandel challenged That listens good to meRememberI m going to order a whole lobsterI should worry what you orderYou ll have to pay for minetooSaykidyou re on Mollie Mandel called out exultantly Let s hook claws on that And she reached out for Frieda s hand Just watch me put it over Esther Malkin was a shortdark girland inclined to be stoutlike her motherShe was nineteen and silentShe had no braceletsno jeweled combsno silver mesh bagno satin slippersnor had she as yet anything put away in the big trunkthough her parents were as worthy as any living in MaxwellShe had not even the desire for those thingsShe was a plain girlThe flour dust which covered her large black eyes and clotted her mass of black hairmerging them into a dull drab jumblelike the dull drab jumble of her clothingalso penetrated and thickened her soulEsther never found herself shaken with strong desirenever complainedand seldom laughedDay after day she plodded from counter to counter in her father s bake shop in Maxwell Streetdealing out loaves of rye bread to shrill women with shawls over their headsand sticky cakes and rolls to fiery eyednoisy childrenAll of her interests were centered upon the immediate and the practical upon the day s receiptsupon making the correct changeupon reserving the shapeliest loaves for the best customersAnd because she could rest but one foot at a time she generally appeared lopsidedOne after another the Maxwell Street girls werebeing married offthough of some it was said that they were not fit to bind a cat s tailYou saw the young men coming fresh from the barber shoptheir hair all glossytheir faces nice and clean so that it was a real pleasure just to look at themAfter an hour you saw them holding the street doors open for their ladieshelping them off the sidewalk and across the streetturning their heads this way and thatlike real genlemenIn a few weeks you saw the young ladies with their hands always at their hairso as to make sure you would see their engagement ringsreal diamondsin golden mountingAnd yetas the mothers camein to order the huge wheaten twisted wedding loavesEsther congratulated them cheerfullywarmlyand never found it necessary to suppress a longingto stifle a sighIt was not that Esther was indifferent to what might become of herShe was merelya kosher Yiddish daughter perpetuated through the ages by the isolation of the ghettoAs in her childhood she had reposed peacefully in the arms of her mothershe now rested securely in the ancient faith of her peoplenever doubting that her own would come to herThe Exalted One forsakes no oneHer man would be no doctor or lawyernot even a down town business man like Mollie Mandel s manLet him only be a nice man and a good bakerand she would be quite thankfulWith a little help from her fatherthey would open a bake shopand even get to move to the Boulevard some day perhapsWhy notThe noonday rush in the Malkin bakenshop was just overOnly the clamor made by the nervous women and children still lingeredSoon thistoofaded outand an empty stillness invaded the shopand a kind of peaceEsther made limply for the edge of the show windowto gaze with unseeing eyes at the feverish swarm outdoorswhile resting her tired bodyAnd a moment later she was dreamingopen eyed day dreamingShe was seated on the front porch of her home On the Boulevard Her man he was away somewhere She did not know where She did not know what he looked likebut he was a nice man And she was surrounded by children a number of childrenSuddenly she was overcome by a scorching desire to press a curly head to her breastto shower furious kisses upon itHelloEsther Mollie Mandel shouted in the doorway Has he got lots of moneyI ll bet he knows how to show a girl a good timeDo I know himWhat s his nameAre you afraid I ll take him away from you She fired the questions in rapid successionwithout waiting for an answerfor she was not interested in what Esther might have to say Just leave it to the quiet ones she continued You needn t blush soOhmyohmyIf I made a mistake all the worse for youYou don t know all the fun you re missingEsther had not uttered a wordShe could notHer mind was not quick enoughMollie Mandel now thought that she had said enough on that subjectso she asked Where s your motherOhhelloMrsMalkinHow are youI seen gold and silverbut you I did not seeYou re looking fine She got down at once to the busines she had in mindand her tone changedThe spirit of banter left herShe spoke from the privileged position of a lady of the Boulevardwhobut for the goodness of her heartmight have spoken differentlyShe was now neither pleading nor arguingShe merely voiced obvious and unassailable truthsand through no other motive than her desire to do good Everybody knows I speak right outBy me there s no tricks and monkey businessWhat can you be thinking aboutWhy do you keep Esther so much at homeShe isn t a baby any more Esther squirmedShe gathered her arms about her as if a stranger had invaded her room while she was dressingMollie Mandel noticed itand became bantering againbut only for a moment Sayif it wasn t right the rabbi wouldn t do itand if it wasn t nice the Czar wouldn t do itWe re among ourselvesThere ain t nobody we got to be ashamed ofIn plain wordsyou got to make her go out and meet peopleA nice weddinga swell ball Saythere s no need my laying a

seasonEsther musn t miss itI ll introduce a bunch of swell fellows to her A smart woman like yousayWhat you forgot some people you and I know will never learnBut we all got to be reminded sometimesHere are three tickets Mollie Mandel stuffed the money into her bag of real alligatot skin with solid gold trimmingMrsMalkin fingered the ticketsnot knowing what else to do with themWith one hand on the doorMollie Mandelsmiling benignlyturned to Esther Estheryou re a nice oneWhy don t you come over to see me sometimesMy house ain t swell enough for youwhatBelieve mewith a house like mine I ain t got nothing to be ashamed ofWithout my losslet God bless you even next year with a house like mineRing me up when you re comingyou hear A long silence followed Mollie Mandel s departureIt was not merely that her breathless flow of words had intimidated both the mother and daughterbut that she had talked all the while she was with themand now she was gone before they had had time to ask her anythingIt took time for them to puzzle out what all had happened to themEsther finally ventured timidly I think Mollie is awful niceShe ain t a bit stuck up or anythingWasn t that a swell coat she had onAchdaughterkin and the mother rocked herself ruefully To all things you got to have luckBefore she got married she had hardly three threads on herso God sends her a good luckand look at her nowA grain of luck is better as a pound of golddaughterkin Again mother and daughter fell silentA film of sadness overspread MrsMalkin s faceThe contrast between Esther s heavy life and Mollie Mandel s rampant prosperity was too great for the mother to accept cheerfullyAnswering to an inner need to do somethingMrsMalkin began to remove the bread crumbs from the counterwithout noticing that she was using her white apron as a dusting clothEsther kept creasing a piece of wrapping paper and smoothing it out again on her kneeoverand over againfor some minutes What ll we do with all them ticketsmother Esther asked suddenly We ain t really going The question took MrsMalkin by surpriseand she barely managed to say We got to hear what the father will say andtaking advantage of the entrance of a customershe said hastily See what MrsSolomon wantsdaughterkinShe s got a little baby at home How that winter afternoon passed Esther did not knowShe could not have said whether it had been long or shortnor how she had spent itWhen she stepped out the door that evening to lock up the shopshe was struck by the appearance of Maxwell StreetIt was as if she had stepped into a strange streetin some strange townThe flaming gasoline torchesthe push carts and standsthe heaps of litter and refuse could it always have been like thatShe did not know what made her so uncomfortableWhen she had reached her rooms she wondered why the windows were not openalthough open windows at that season of the yearexcept on Friday morningswhen the house was being made ready to receive Sabbath the Queenwere unknown in the Malkin householdShe had to have airShe pushed up the windowthe lace curtains flappedand Esther was annoyed at the smell of dustShe put her head out the windowand noticed for the first time that the electric street lamps were all on one side of the streetand she wondered were they like that on all streetsThen she recalled that there were four rows of electric lights on the Boulevardtwo rows on either sideShe closed the windowand sat down on the edge of the bedThe light of the street lampscoming in through the windowdid not reach to where she satbut she did not light the gasShe wanted to sit in the darkShe was tiredLong after Esther fell asleep that night her father and mother still talked of her and the bail All the biggest swells go to that ball MrsMalkin informed her husband in a tone as if she had known of it all her lifethat her hard headed husband might not doubt it Everybody from the BoulevardAnd it ain t as if she didn t have nobody thereMollie Mandel will be there to look after herand Mollie can do a whole lot where she wants toSuch a fine chanceAll the biggest swells from the BoulevardThe foolsih woman what you areRight away you got to take and get scaredSwells they are what go to that ballyesWhat kind of swells are theytell meheyWhatyou don t knowWhat are you trying to talk yourself intoAs if everybody didn t know them swellsTell mehow long is it since they moved away from Maxwell Streetand Union Streetand Liberty Streethey MrMalkin hurled these statements at his wife with greater violence than the occasion demandedand he was in part aware of itHe raged not merely to cover a retreat from a position he was not able to defend his wife clearly had him at a disadvantage and he knew itHe had given too little thought to his daughter s futurean offence much more heinous in the ghetto than elsewhereBut he was a weak manwith little of originality and daringHis successeven when measured by Maxwell Street standardswas the result of neither his foresight nor courageCountrymen of hisby the tens of thousandshad crowded about him that they might ease the violence of the change in their livesthat they might share in the greater security of kindred presencein the comfort of familiar speech and mannersThe thousands of the ghetto had enabled him to profit by his peasant grubbing instinctto exploit the racial tenacity of himselfhis wife and his daughterHe blustered thus violently that he might dissipate his resentment of himself for his past behaviorNow that his wife had thrown him into a paniche felt that his neglect would surely have led to disasterbut for the kindly intervention of Mollie MandelHis irritation was greatbecause the love he bore his daughter was greatand it called for many word to relieve him Let somebody mention swells to youand right away you got to take and get scaredBy you everybody is a swell what lives on the BoulevardAnd maybe if he s got to have a silver dollar he runs around like a poisoned mouse You say Mollie Mandel is going to look after EstherkinSurethat s very niceand we got to remember to thank her for itBut that s nothing to get scared forSure Estherkin s got to go to the ballhow elseWho said noDid you hear me say noshe can t gotell meWhat one must one mustthat s allAnd as for a dress and thingsNuWhen you re going to be hanged by one foot you may as well be hanged by the other alsoMaybe we can as well afford it as most of them swellsthank God if she s really got to have themIt ain t too late yetSuresureit ain t too late yet MrsMalkin agreed readilyShe had feared a harder tussleShe herself was more troubled than she had dared disclose to her husbandThe ball seemed to her a dangerous undertakingeven though she did not know where danger might lieAndas much to allay her own fears as to prevent her husband from changing his mindshe added quickly Thank Godthank Godit ain t too late yetBut we got to look aroundAnother yearand another yearand maybe it is too laeGod forbid The following daylike all previous days in endless numberbegan for Esther with the ringing of the alarm clock in the darkness of her bedroomShe felt the same worn carpet underfootthe same damp clothingthe waist she had washed before going to bed hung limp on the newspaper over the back of the chairwhere it would remain until the following bedtime to be ironed thus it had always beenBut this morning Esther found it hard to finish dressingand had to press her cheek against the foot end of her iron bedThe rattle and clack of a milk wagon made her jumpShe was lateShe had always aimed to have the shop open and the gas lighted by the time the milk man came aroundbut now she had to waste still more timebunting for the little ha rpins she bad somehow misplaced when undressingShe walked heavily down the stairsAnother day of bread and cakescakes and breadthesame as it had alwaysbeen all the days of her life as far back as she could rememberWhen she stepped out into the gray of the cold street there appeared to be something ghostly about itShe did not know that she had but just begun to notice the world about herThe thought of the ball popped into her head as soon as she catered the shopHad her mother talked to her father about itWhat had he saidShe just knew that he had refused to listen to it at allShe did not know whether she cared or notNoshe was gladWhy should she befuddle her own head with balls and thingsShe listened for her mother s stepShe kept asking of old customers was there anything they wantedShe miscounted cakesand astonished women kept asking her what had suddenly got into herShe heard her mother s heavy tread on the stairs and started for the door to meet herbut checked herself in timeand busied herself with rearranging the loavesIt was a long time before her mother would say anythingFinally she said The father says we got to go to the ballWe go to the ball Yes Esther was sure shehad heard arightbut wished her mother would say it againThen she read confirmation of the good news in her mother s facce and added quietly Maybe that will be niceto be continued TETELESTAI Conrad Aiken I How shall we praise the magnificence of the

menowIwho was arrogant beg youTell meas I lie down that I was courageousBlow horns of victory now as I reel and am vanquishedShatter the sky with trumpets above my graveIV LookThis flesh how it crumbles to dust and is blownThese boneshow they grind in a granite of frost and are nothingThis skull how it yawns for a flicker of time in the darkness Yet laughs not and sees notit is crushed by a hammer of sunlightAnd the hands are destroyed Press down through the leaves of the jasmine Dig through the interlaced roots nevermore will you find meI was no better than dustyet you cannot replace me Take the soft dust in your hand does it stirdoes it singHas it lips and a heartDoes it open its eyes to the sunDoes it rundoes it dreamdoes it burn with a secretor tremble In terror of deathOr ache with tremendous decisionsListenIt says I lean by the riverThe willows Are yellowed withbudWhite clouds roar up from the south And darken the ripplesyet they cannot darken my heartNor the face like a star in my heartRain falls on the water And pelts it and rings it with silverThe willow trees glistenThe sparrows chirp under the eavesbut the face in my heart Is a secret of music I wait in the rain and am silent Listen againIt says I have workedI am tiredThe pencil dulls in my handI see through the window Walls upon walls of windows with faces behind themSmoke floating up to the skyan ascension of sea gullsI am tiredI have struggled in vainmy decision was fruitlessWhythen do I waitwith darknessso easyat handBut to morrow perhaps I will wait and endure till to morrow Or again It is darkThe decision is madeI am vanquished By terror of lifeThe walls mount slowly about me In coldnessI had not the courageI was forsakenI cried outwas answered by silence TetelestaiV Hear how it babblesBlow the dust out of your handWith its voices and visionstread on itforget itturn homeward With dreams in your brain Thisthenis the humblethe namelessThe loverthe husband and fatherthe struggler with shadowsThe one who went down under shoutings of chaosthe weakling Who cried hisforsaken like Christ on the darkening hilltop Thisthenis the one who implores as he dwindles to silenceA fanfare of glory

selling modern books and artIn November 1917we tried to recount our achievements and new hopesNow in November1918at a moment of solemn import for the world we wish to remind our friends and explain to those who have not yet heard of theSunwise Turnthat in our third year we see the task that we have set ourselves to do more clearly than ever as a factor of value in the new ageMany a time in these difficult war years we have nearly given up under the financial strugglebut at the darkest moment would come some visible sign that the Sunwise Turn is needed and that we must keep going on some way for the few until the many would come to us and not only make our work count for more but make it easier for us to do it wellWe are fighting the fight for the small bookshopWe want to be just one of a great number of bookshops that will help increase the number of good books read by every American to a figure for just prideand make it impossible for a man in Nevada or MainePorto Rico or Hawaii to remain ignorant of what John Dewey or Robert Frost or Arthur BDavies or any of the great Americans is doingto make it certain that he shall have the chance to know about all the special forms through which our common life is finding expressionto know that the outlook for democracy is hopeless unless the controlling institutions of society are studied and improvedWe want to disseminate notBooks of Knowledgebut books of thought to help awaken America to broad issues of human function and save her from the fatuity of palliative opportunismTwelve books no one should leave unreadDemocracy After the
