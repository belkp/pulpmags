edited1Never maltreat your own intelligence with parablesIt is a method of herd hypnotismDo not send yourself to sleep with the rhythm of the passes that you make As an example of herd hypnotismGerman literature is so virulently allegorized that the German really never knows whether he is a Kangaroo a Scythianor his own sweet selfYouhoweverare a HerdsmanThat is surely Parable enough 2Do not admit clevernessin any forminto your lifeObserve the accomplishment of some people s signaturesIt is the herd touch 3Exploit StupidityIntroduce a flatnesswhere it is required into your commerceDull your eye as you fix it on a dull faceWhy do you think George Borrow used such idiotic clichés asThe beams of the descending luminaryHe was a great writer and knew what he was doingMock the herd perpetually with the grimance of its own garrulity or deadnessIf it gets out of hand and stampedes towards youleap on to the sea of mangy backs until the sea is stillThat iscast your mask asideand spring above themThey cannot see or touch anything above Copyright1917by Margaret CAnderson 4 The Little Review themthey have never realized that their backs or rather their tops existThey will think that you have vanished into Heaven 4As to languageeschew all clichés implying a herd personalityNever allow such terms as Top HolePricelessor Doggo to pass your lipsGo to the Dictionary if you want an epithetIf you feel eloquentuse that moment to produce a cliché of your ownCherish your personal vocabularyhowever small it isUse your own epithet as though it were used by a whole nationif people would have no good

MerionethHe is a preuxahyes a preux You can sayahyes a preuxas though it were one wordaccent on theyes5In accusing yourselfstick to the Code of the MountainBut crime is alien to a Herdsman s nature 6Yourself must be your Caste 7Cherish and developside by sideyour six most constant indications of different personalitiesYou will then acquire the potentiality of six menLeave your front door one day at B The next march down the street as EA variety of clotheshats especiallyare of help in this wider dramatisation of yourselfNever fall into the vulgarity of being or assuming yourself to be one egoEach trench must have another one behind itEach single self that you manage to be at any given time must have five at least indifferent to itYou must have a power of indifference of five to oneAll the greatest actions in the world have been five parts out of six impersonal in the impulse of their originTo follow this principle you need only cultivate your memoryYou will avoid being the blind man of any momentThe Little Review 5 B will see what is hidden to DWho were Turgenev sSix Unknown Himself8Never lieYou cannot be too fastidious about the truthIf you must lieat least see that you lie so badly that it would not deceive a pea henThe world ishoweverfull of pea hens 9Spend some of your spare time every day in hunting your weaknessescaught from commerce with the herdas methodicallysolemnly and vindictively as a monkey his fleasYou will find yourself swarming with them while you are surrounded by humanityBut you must not bring them up on the mountainIf you can get another man to assist you onethat ishonest enough not to pass his own on to you that is a good arrangement 10Do not play with political notionsaristocratisms or the reversefor that is a compromise with the herdDo not allow yourself to imaginea fine herd though still a herd There is no fine herdThe cattle that call themselvesgentlemenyou will observe to be a little cleanerIt is merely cunning and produced with a product called soapBut you will find no serious difference between them and those vast dismal herds they avoidSome of them are very dangerous and treacherousBe on your guard with the small herd of gentlemen 11You will meet with this pitfallat momentssurrounded by the multitude of unsatisfactory replicasyou will grow confused by a similarity bringing them so near to us You will reasonwherefrom some points of viewthe difference is so slightwhether that delicate margin is of the immense importance that we hold it to bethe only thing of importance in fact That group of men talking by the fire in your clubyou will still remain a member of your club that party at the theatrelook good enoughyou will sayTheir skins are freshthey are well madetheir manners are goodYou must then consider what they really areOn closer inspection you knowfrom unpleasant experiencethat they are nothing but limitations and vulgarities of the most irritating descriptionThe devil Nature has painted these sepulchres pinkand covered them with a blasphemous Bond Street distinctionMatter that has not sufficient mind to permeate it growsas you knowgangrenous and rottenAnimal high spiritsa littlebut easily exhaustedgoodnessis all that they can claim The Little Review 6 What seduced you from your severity for a moment was the same thing as a dull woman s good looks This is probably what you will have in front of youOn the other handeverywhere you will find a few peoplewhoalthough not a mountain people are not herdThey may be herdsmen gone mad through contact with the herdand strayedor through inadequate energy for our task they may be found thereor they may be a hybridor they may even be herdsmen temporarily bored with the mountain I have a pipe below myself sometimes There are numerousother denominations Treat them as brothersEmploy themas opportunity offersas auxiliaries in your dutiesTheir society and help will render your task less arduous 12As to womenwherever you cansubstitute the society of men Treat them kindlyfor they suffer from the herdalthough of itand have many of the same contempts as yourselfThey are a sort of bastard mountain peopleThere must be somewhere a female mountaina sort of mirage mountainI should like to visit itBut womenand the processes for which they existare the arch conjuring trickand they have the cheap mystery and a good deal of the slipperinessof the conjuror Sodomy should be avoidedas far as possibleIt tends to add to the abominable confusion already existing 13Wherever you meet a shyness that comes out of solitude although all solitude is not anti herdnaivenessand a patent absence of contaminationthe sweetness of mountain waterany of the signs of goodnessyou must treat that as sacredas portions of the mountainHowever much you suffer for ityou must defend and exalt itOn the other handevery child is not simpleand every woman is not weakIn many cases to champion a female would be like springing to the rescue of a rhinoceros when you notice that it had been attacked by a fleaChivalrous mannersagainwith many women are like tiptoeing into a shed where an ox is sleeping Some childrentoorival in nastiness their parentsBut you have your orders in this matterIndifference where there should be nothing but the whole eagerness or compunction of your beingis the worst crime in the mountain s eyes 14Conquests have usually been divided from their antithesesand defeats from conquestsby some casual eventHad Moscow not possessed a governor ready to burn the Kremlin The Little Review 7 and the hundreds of palaces accumulated therepeace would have been signed by the Czar at Bonaparte s entrance Had the Liascans persevered for ten days against Cortésthe Aztecs would never have been troubledYet Montezuma was right to remain inactiveparalysed by prophecyNapoleon was right when he felt that his star was at last a useless oneHe had drained it of all its astonishing effulgenceThe hair s breadth is only the virtuosity of Fateguiding you along imaginary precipicesAnd all the detail is make believeanywayWatch your star soberly and without commentDo not trouble about the paste board cliffs 15There are very stringent regulations about the herd keeping off the sides of the mountainIn fact your chief function is to prevent their encroachingSomein moments of boredom or vindictivenessare apt to make rushes for the higher regionsTheir instinct always fortunately keeps them in crowds or bandsand their trespassing is soon noticedThose traps and numerous devices you have seen on the edge of the plain are for useof coursein the last resortDo not apply them prematurely Not very many herdsmen lose their lives in dealing with the herds 16Contradict yourselfIn order to liveyou must remain broken up 17The teacher does not have to bealthough he has to knowHe is the mind imaginingnot the executantThe executantthe youngsveltmiraculous atheletethe strapping virtuosoreally has to give the illusion of a perfectionDo not expect me to keep in sufficiently good training to perform the feats I recommendI usually remain up on the mountain 18Above all this sad commerce with the herdlet something veritably remainun peu sur la montagne Always come down with masks and thick clothing to the valley where we workStagnant gasses from these Yahooesque and rotten herds are more dangerous often than the wandering cylinders that emit themSee you are not caught in them without your mask But once returned to our adorable heightforget your sallow taskwith great freedom indulge your love The terrible processions beneath are not of our makingand are without our pityOur sacred hill is a volcanic heavenBut the result of its violence is peace The unfortunate

pentagonal stones led along between shrubberyHalting by the central court in a sort of narrow gallerythe large tank was below themand in it some thirty or forty blond nereids for the most part well muscledwith smooth flaxen hair and smooth faces a generic resemblanceA slender brown wench sat at one end listlessly dabbling her feet from the spring boardHere the water was deeperThe rest of themall being clothed in white linen shifts held up by one strap over the shoulder and reaching half way to the kneesthe rest of them waded waistand breast deep in the shallower end of the pooltheir shifts bellied up by the airspread out like huge bobbing cauliflowersThe whole tank was sunken beneath the level of the gardensand paved and pannelled with marblea rather cheap marbleTo the left of the little gallerywhere the strangers had haltedan ample dowager sat in a perfectly circular tub formed rather like the third of an hogsheadbehind her a small hemicycle of yew trees kept off any chance

rhetoricians ruined the empireLet us go on to our bathsFinisThree Nightpieces John Rodker TOWARD eight o clock I begin to feel my pulses accelerating quietlyA little aftermy heart begins to thump against its wallsI tremble all overand leaving the room rapidly go out on the terrace of the house and look over the wealdThere is a shadowiness of outline and the air is crispThe sky in one corner is a pale nostalgic roseThe trees look like weeds and a bird flies up through them like a fish lazily risingThe hills really look like breastsand each moment I look for the head of the Titan negress to rise with the moon in the lobe of her earI think of my youth and the intolerable legacy it left meI think of the crazy scaffolding of my youth and wonder why I should be surprised that the superstructure should be crazy toowavering to every breeze and threatening ever to come down about my earsI think too of wrongs done to this one and that oneandOhmy God I cry I did not knowI did not know and my heart thumps louder in my breast and my pulses throb like a tide thundering and sucking at some crumbling jettyI gulp deep breaths of air to steady myselfbut it is of no goodI think of her whom I love and futility overwhelms mefor this too will have its common endand our orbits grow ever remoterThe Little Review 17 And putting my head on my breastfaint and reminiscent the smell from my armpits rises to my brainand she stands before me vividly and the same smell comes from herbut it is more heady and more musky and she looks at me with intolerable humilityAnd a minute after there is only the darka hoot owl s terrifying call and the queer yap that comes in replythe frogs that thud through the grass like uncertain feetthe trees that talk to each otherAnd I would willingly let my life out gurgling and stickyand sink without a bubble into its metallic opacityII I HAD gone to bed quietly at my wife s sidekissing her casually as was my customI awoke about two in the morning with a start so sudden that it seemed I had been shot by a cannon out of the obscurity of sleep into the light of wakingat one moment I had beenas it weregagged and bound by sleepand the next I was wide awake and could distinctly sense the demarking line between sleep and wakingAnd this demarking line was like a rope made of human hair such as one sees in exhibitions of indigenous Japanese productsIn my ears still rang the after waves of the shriek which had awakened meThe nerves governing my skin were still out of control as a result of the sudden frightand portions of it continued twitching for a long time aftermy scalp grew cold in patches and my hair stood on end In the dark I found myself trembling all over and bathed in a cold sweat And it was impossible to collect myselfMy wifeI feltwas sitting up in bed and a minute afterward she began to weep quietlyI was still trembling and her quiet weeping made me more afraidI was angry with her toobut could not talk to herI was so afraidMy voiceI knewwould have issued thin and quaveringand I was afraid of its hollow reverberations losing themselves uncertainly in the darknessBy the little light I saw her put her hands up to her head in despairas though still half asleepand before I could stop her again the same piercingincredibly terrifying shriek burst from herAgain I trembled all overinvoluntarily gnashing my teeth and feeling my skin ripple like loathsome wormsThe Little Review 18Stop I criedseizing her by the arms Stop afraid to wake heryet more afraid to hear again that appalling shriek and in a moment she was awakelooking wildly round herand the quiet weeping gave way to a wild and tempestuous sobbingI was afraid of herafraid to go on sleeping with herlest she should again shriek in that wild and unearthly fashionafraid to fall asleep again lest I should be awakened by that appalling shriek dinning in my ears and my body quivering vilely under the impossible soundI clung to her What is ittell me at least what it is I saidFor a time she would not tell meTrembling all over with anguish and fear of I knew not whatI insistedWhen at last she did tell me it was as though the world had suddenly been cut away from under my feetHelplessly and weeping I clung to herwith cold at my heartThat any human being could accuse another of devilry so sinisterso coldso incredible even in dreamI had not conceived ofLoathing herI clung the closer in my anguish and despairIII ONE night at supper I had eaten cucumberSoon after I went to bed and on the first strokes of ten fell asleepAfter sleeping for a long time I awoke into a dimly lit roomI still lay on the bed and after a moment a figure enteredand after a few moments moreanotheruntil in this fashion there were half a dozen people in the roomI could not distinguish who they wereand quietly and obscurely they moved round my bedNow and then there was a hiss out of the corners of the roomor a chuckle in reply to some unheard obscenityA heavy weight oppressed me as though I knew they menaced me in some obscure and dreadful wayI could not moveI could not moveand always the same obscure and dreadful procession encircled me and shadowy bodies pressed a little closerthen drew back again to join the sinister groupAnd though I saw nothing save their shadowy formsI knew their eyes gleamed down at metheir faces were lecheroustheir hands clawedand forever and through long ages they went round me in sinister processionSuddenlyand how I do not knowI had broken the bonds of of sleep and lay trembling in a cold sweatThrough my protecting blankets the last strokes of ten were fadingImprovisations Louis Gilmore I My thoughts are fish That dwell in a twilight Of green watersThey are silver fish That dart here and there Streaking the still water Of a pondMy thoughts are birds That have hung their nests Near the sunThey are yellow birds That drift on stretched wings Over a sea untroubled By a sailMy thoughts are beasts That crouch and wait In a black forestMy thoughts are apes That clamber through the tree tops Towards the moonIIIn winter People intensify Their individuality In housesIn spring By the side of lakes Beneath trees

interestingand instructivecriticism on our four pianists and a wonderful short story by Sherwood Andersonthose two things and a Harold Bauer eulogy are about the only two things I can recall favorablyA story written to protest against the hanging of one of our worst criminialsas in the very first Little Review I received I remember because it disgusted me another story ridiculing our part in the waras in the last number and other queer Emma Goldman sort of storiesin between these first and last copiesare way beyond meWhy should one be a Democrat or a Christian or a Militarist or a MrsPotter Palmer or a push face policeman to believe in our cause for entering the warI wish every paper and magazine might help inspire the right sort of war enthusiasmManya few years agobelieved in peace at any pricebut many minds have changedincluding my ownIf the real business of life is to livewe ll fight for the privilege so long as we can t rely on any other means of gaining that rightAnd we want at least a few more generations to live as well as our ownIf there are various ideas of whatlivingmeans I m glad there are those who can never understand Emma Goldman s theoriesGerman women can t realize whatlivingmeans if they feel obliged to get off the sidewalk to let pass a German officerDo these men who are afraid to fight for their country know what living meansmen who drink and smokeWould they believe they stand less chance of recovery from sicknessless chance of resisting sicknessless chance of living very longthan the men who never touch alcohol or tobacco But this is not the point eitherand men are reforming Anyway I would rather give a dollar and a half to the Red Cross than subscribe for The Little ReviewAnd also I m not intellectual enough to enjoy it There is really nothing to be said to the above two lettersexplanation up against what must be a matter of evolutionIt would be necessary to give out sample copies for a year or so to prospective subscribersto insure satisfaction before we take their moneySince there are Hearst publications to give the public what it wants in literature and artthe cinematagraph to give it what it wants in dramawhy should that public bother at all with The Little ReviewEspecially when we state fairly that we are a magazine of the Artsmaking no compromise with the public tastejh Interest Begins at Home FER ChicagoI have

of your views and the reasons why they do not agree with mineHaving the relation of art to life and to societyas a questionseriously to heartI would prefer a serious reply to a serious article rather than a flippant reply to chance remarksI had hoped that discussions would arise among the Reader Critic that would interest a larger circle of readers and that would sift the question thoroughlyIt seems to me that the last few numbers of The Little Review have been below your earlier standard almost below zeroWhat sympathy can the majority of readers feel for the foreign editorEzra Poundwith his contemptuous invective against thevulgus The last letter of Wyndham Lewisto be surehas more food for thoughtthough it seems that the author s acquaintance with Russian literature is rather limitedI could say more about that but I await the psychological moment To be very serious I had no idea that this department was ever flippantI thought we had said so much about art values that we couldn t go on boring our audience forever with the same discussionsAnd discussing Art isn t very profitable anywayWe re trying to show what it isWhen you asked questions which seemed to me quite obviousor at least seemed to show quite obviously that you didn t understand what we had said in clearing up those valuesI knew no better way to point up our disagreement than by using what is known asepithetinstead of going off into long serious discussions of matters that had already beengot across A contempt for thevulgusis the inevitable reaction of any man or woman who observes the antics of theflies in the marketplace There s nothing supercilious about itIt s a fact that humanity is the most stupid and degraded thing on the planetwhether through its own fault or not is beside the point when you re weighing valuesYou re not blaming humanity when you say thatit isn t interesting to blamethe interesting thing is to put the truth of it into a form that will endureMCA Note Banish Anne
