shadows part Living flames out of the dusk Are the lightning throbs of love In the passionate lover s heart   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE INTOXICATED POET  A poet having taken the bridle off his tongue spoke thus More fragrant than the heliotrope which blooms all the year round better than vermilion letters on tablets of sendal are thy kisses thou shy one  THE JONQUILS  I have heard that a certain princess when she found that she had been married by a demon wove a wreath of jonquils and sent it to the lover of former days  THE LUSCIOUS NECTARINE  In the season of drouth when the sallow rice bowed down before the reaper s hook the faithful lover walking in the Garden of Friendship plucked a luscious nectarine and thinking of the beautiful betrothed he wished the marriage day were come  THE MARIGOLD  Even as the seed of the marigold carried by the wind lodges on the roofs of palaces and lights the air with flame coloured blossoms so may the child like words of the insignificant poet confer honour on lofty and disdainful mandarins   Scented Leaves  THE MERMAID  The sailor boy who leant over the side of the Junk of Many Pearls and combed the green tresses of the sea with his ivory fingers believing that he had heard the voice of a mermaid cast his body down between the waves  THE MIDDLE KINGDOM  The emperors of fourteen dynasties clad in robes of yellow silk embroidered with the Dragon wearing gold diadems set with pearls and rubies and seated on thrones of incomparable ivory have ruled over the Middle Kingdom for four thousand years  THE MILKY WAY  My mother taught me that every night a procession of junks carrying lanterns moves silently across the sky and the water sprinkled from their paddles falls to the earth in the form of dew I no longer believe that the stars are junks carrying lanterns no longer that the dew is shaken from their oars  THE NIGHT  In the hall of ebony there grows a tree with golden tassels In the branches is a silver nest out of which

please and hold communication with the unknown Keeper of the Tower   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE TARTAR  When the victorious general Ching Wu Had overthrown the Tartars and their chief Made

years ago on another planet far off where different constellations hang once a poet forgetting sorrow walked in summer along a white cliff high above the sea with a boy beside him And the boy said There in that house before I lost my father and fell into poverty formerly I lived and in that turret with its little window I passed happy hours And as he listened the poet felt deep in his heart a mystic pain such as he had never felt in looking back upon the lost palaces of his own youth Afterwards the boy was drowned at sea   Scented Leaves  and the heart of the poet was drowned in care yet to the end of his troubled life he never saw in stone or picture neither heard nor read of a turret like that one but over him there stole the same mystic sorrow like the breath of flowers out of a hidden garden like a chord of music from passionate harpstrings away in some immortal world  THE WORD  The first time the emperor Han heard a certain Word he said It is strange The second time he said It is divine The third time he said Let the speaker be put to death  Allien Upward   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE IDOL  Deep in an ancient forest a huge stone idol stood Where thronged the dusky worshipers in gratitude for good With humhle hearts in rudest strains they praised their god benign Serene in measureless repose the idol gave no sign  In times of sorest trial their chieftain oft would pray That there might fall upon his path some guiding heavenly ray Out of thy wisdom manifold let but one word be mine Serene in measureless repose the idol gave no sign  When dire disaster smote the tribe or famine s toll was paid The trembling people bowed to earth and sought the idol s aid Or frenzied cursed its stony smile and changeless brow malign Serene in measureless repose the idol gave no sign  Grave priests declared Yon sits the god who heeds no man s behest  Ye cannot see ye must not know yet all is for the best vain are tears in vain is praise yet worship the divine   gt  The Idol  Serene in measureless repose the idol gave no sign  Behold a wretch despairing fled before the painted foe With sobbing breath the victim fell he could no further go Ah Would that dark libation were but of crimson wine Serene in measureless repose the idol gave no sign  Pass seasons years long centuries The people die  away Amid a dwindling forest rots a crumbling image gray Now but a formless bulk of rock draped in a living vine  Serene in measureless repose the idol gives no sign  Tudor Jenks   POETRY A Magasine of Verse  FARMER S BLOOD  To My Grandmother  They said it was too hard for you who were alone and old To live there any longer And so the farm was sold  And you to whom the wind had blown across they ellow wheat Made no complaint against the life upon the narrow  street But many times you stole away all by yourself to stand Here by the upper window where the wide and lovely land Sweeps to the farmhouse gleaming white upon the wooded  hill Just looking off with yearning eyes quite patient very still  Ah nevermore for you the herd should wind along the lane The dogs come barking o er the snow the reapers toss the  grain  THE HEARTENING  It may be that the words I spoke To cheer him on his way To him were vain but I myself Was braver all that day   CONTENTMENT  The wide grey sweep of ocean and the long white curl of  foam The ever pleading wash of waves the never ceasing moan I used to scorn their beauty with a heart that spurned its  home  Oh for the silver shining of fair cities o er the sands Oh for the song of dusky throats in dim and distant lands They reached to me as women reach their slim and lovely  hands  I followed neath the alien sky and through the stranger s door And now I crown my wandering with peace that asks no more Than just to lie and watch the surf along the dear home shore QUEST  Ho all you eager travelers Have you some place to go Where you forget the many things You wish you did not know Forget your own insistent past And feel just fit and free If you have found it won t you tell Its happy name to me  Winifred Webb   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE HUNTING SONG OF THEM THAT DID NOT HUNT  Good day said the damsel Good morrow to you For if you mean hunting I would hunt with you too  I am weary of making And baking the bread If you stay in my parlour I will hunt in your stead  You shall sup in my parlour My white wine and broth I am weary of weaving The sendal and cloth  Good day said the damsel Good even to you What is good for the huntsman Is good for me too   DAGONET S CANZONET  A queen lived in the South And music was her mouth And sunshine was her hair By day and all the night The drowsy embers there Remember d still the light  My soul was she not fair  But for her eyes they made An iron man afraid Like sky blue pools they were Watching the sky that knewi Itself transmuted there Light blue or deeper blue  My sou was ski not fair  The lifting of her hands Made laughter in the lands Where the sun is in the South But my soul learnt sorrow there In the secrets of her mouth Her eyes her hands her hair  Oh soul was she not fair Ernest Rhys   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SWAN CREEK  Stream stream stream Oh the willows by the stream The poplars and the willows And the gravel all agleam  Oh oh oh And the mourning doves sang Oh From their hiding in the oak tops Looking on the world below  Sky sky sky And all wide and round the sky With the white clouds rising coming Coming shining drifting by  Home home home And beyond the wood was home With the old road leading ready Where the open door said come  Dream dream dream Now 1 wake not but I dream Of the old road and the ring doves And the willows by the stream  Williston Fish    SONG OF THE MECHANICS  Stilled for a moment be jester s lay and the piping notes of Pan Mid your mellow music we high essay to sing a song of Man Short be its phrases as short our speech who fashion the mill and loom If the work of our hands not better teach then give a Man song room  When the hammers their thunderous din renew by the roaring of furnace fires We see the forging of dreams come true the shaping of long desires The walls of Progress we carry high though stained by crime and blood For your wondrous beauty and joy we die O coming Brotherhood  Then drink to labor an honest cup and let its worth be known The ghosts of the past come trooping up bearing the brick and stone Dig they the trenches broad and deep and shape foundations strong   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Whose good the future years may keep when coming builders throng  The savage strives for his home his brood he fends for his race his kin The workman toils for the common good that takes the whole world in Not only for dollars which mean but bread and refuge from rain and snow But that peace may prosper of war instead for the Master willed it so  A Workman spread the heavens wide a Workman placed the sun A Master Workman was satisfied when the Maker said Well done Take we no shame if we be but tools clumsy and dull and worn If over us infinite justice rules to mould the years unborn  George W Priest   DANCING TO A CHEWINK S SONG  One day when by a path I stood That strayed its way out of a wood To heat the woodbirds early song Before I drove my feet along There came from out the trees soft shade A most delightful buoyant maid Who seemed no more of me afraid Than of the birds whose joyous singing Set her splendid legs to springing Till my heart went singing winging And my body woke and swayed  And then when near to me she drew She smiled as most wood maidens do And her sweet voice rang out with laughter And all the trees went echoing after She raised bare arms above her head And beckoned me and then she fled More blithesome than the chickadees Down a path of arching trees Quick of foot as any breeze And I followed where she led  And when we came to a wide brook One mighty flying leap she took And then it seemed she almost died   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Of laughter while I grimly tried That cursed running stream to cross On little boulders green with moss And when I tumbled both feet slipping In the stream and came up dripping Up and down she ran a tripping Seeking flowers at me to toss  Oh how a girl loose frocked can kick When kicking isn t just a trick But effervescence of pure joy That bubbles up as in a boy She stretched her arms to me and called When out upon a stone I d crawled And fingers busy kisses throwing All her face alive and glowing Danced until my poor wits going Off again I supped enthralled  At last when on the bank I stood She ran again into the wood And now and then a joyous cry Rang through the trees to guide me by And yet however hard I tried It was n t till her quick eyes spied A mother squirrel in her nest Baby squirrels at her breast   Dancing to a Chewink s Song  That she stopped a time to rest Letting me creep up beside Soft eyed she watched with hand held out To warn me that I must n t shout Or crackle dead limbs with my feet And then I heard the wood s heart beat And suddenly the mood was stilled That in a blithesome hour had willed For me to caper to the skilled Abandon of her girlish graces Running joyous pagan races Through the arching leaf hung places Till her cup of fun was filled  And silently she slipped away Into the east where each new day The sun comes up across the sky While living things are born and die And trailing her with strident cry I almost reached her side again And saw her eyes were filled with pain For all the trees took up my calling Echoed it like giant s brawling While she ran through sunbeams falling And was gone like summer rain  If you had ever watched for long A girl with body lithe and strong   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Go dancing to a chewink s song And then at last just when you thought You had her radiant body caught Away from you she d swiftly flown You too would call in plaintive tone And run about like something blind Begging her to be more kind Crying like the winter wind Through a lonesome forest blown  Out of the woods in headlong race I ran and tripped and fell through space Down by the crossroads near a spring Where all the peewits come to sing And then the next clear thing I knew Across my face a soft wind blew And at my side a girl was kneeling All the world went reeling wheeling And her lips to mine came stealing Softer than the morning dew  Francis Buzzell   REVIEWS AND COMMENTS  THE NEW LAUREATE  R ASQUITH was neither adventurous nor democratic in appointing Robert Bridges Poet Laureate He followed a scholarly tradition soothed with the honor the declining years of a modern descendant  of Addison an Oxonian closet singer of graceful discreet love verses and carefully carved classic dramas Of course Mr Bridges poetry is as much better than Addison s as his scholarship is more exact than that of Queen Anne s gentlemanly dilettante of letters and politics it would be a pity if two centuries of international culture had not raised out standards in this art as in the others for him who cultivates poetry as an accomplishment  But the two men belong to the same class Essentially it is the eighteenth century ideal that Mr Bridges follows and it is eighteenth century verse that he writes His poetry is a clear and gentle stream never troubled by a spring flood Limpid quiet sometimes playful it moves softly through peaceful rural scenes as unaware of cities railroads steamboats as it is of mountains and cataracts It mirrors the gray green English country through which it travels but not with Spenser s piquant lyricism or Wordsworth s depth of still sincerity If Mr Bridges has moved far enough from Queen Anne s city   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  bound classicists to become aware under Virgilian sanction of idyllic and pastoral nature his mood ïs still pre Shelleyan reminiscent of Thomson or Gray rather than the Victorians  Of highly artificialized made co order poetry such as the eighteenth century loved one could scarcely find a better example than Mr Bridges Elegy on a Lady Whom Grief for ike Death of Her Betrothed Killed And of vers de société Love verses there are few prettier examples than I Will Not Let Thee Go Perhaps the most rhythmically descriptive of his Shorter Poems is London Snow and the most airily exquisitely graceful is that dialogue between the muse and the poet which contains this delicate quatrain  She must be fair of face As bold of heart she seems If she would match her grace With the delight of dreams  But of all the new laureate s poems the one which seems most personal and sincere at once true and tender in grace is this lyric  I have loved flowers that fade  Within whose magic tents  Rich hues have marriage made  With sweet unmemoried scents  A honeymoon delight  A joy of love at sight  That ages in an hour  My song be like a flower  I have loved airs that die  Before their charm is writ  Along a liquid sky  Trembling to welcome it  Notes that with pulse of fire  Proclaim the spirit s desire  Then die and are nowhere  My song be like an air   Reviews and Comments  Die song die like a breath  And wither as a bloom  Fear not a flowery death  Dread not an airy tomb  Fly with delight fly hence  Twas thine love s tender sense  To feast now on thy bier  Beauty shall shed a tear  H M IMPRESSIONISM SOME SPECULATIONS  II  One of my friends a Really Serious Critic has assured me that my poem called To All the Dead was not worth publishing because it is just Browning Let me to further this speculation just confess that I have never read Browning and that roughly speaking I cannot read poetry at all I never really have been able to And then let me analyze this case because it is the plight of many decent serious people friends of mine  As boys we I and my friends read Shapespeare with avidity Virgil to the extent of getting at least two Books of the Aeneid by heart Horace with pleasure and Ovid s Persephone Rapta with delight We liked very much the Bacchae of Euripides I mean that we used to sit down and take a read in these things sometimes apart from the mere exigencies of the school curriculum A little later Herrick moved us to ecstasy and some of Donne we liked passages of Fletcher of Marlowe of Webster and of Kyd At that time we really loved the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Minnesingers and fell fiat in admiration before anything of Heine The Troubadors and even the Northern French Epics we could not read French poetry did not exist for us at all If we read a French poem at all we had always to read it twice once to master the artificial rhythm once for the sense  Between seventeen and eighteen we read Rossetti Catullus Theocritus Bion Moschus and still Shakespeare Herrick Heine Elizabethan and Jacobean lyrics Crashaw Herbert and Donne Towards eighteen we tried Swinburne Tennyson Browning and Pope We could not read any of them we simply and physically couldn t sit down with them in the hand long enough to master more than a few lines We never read any Tennyson at all except for the fragment about the Eagle never read any Swinburne at all except for a poem or two Browning we read sufficient to get the hang of Fifine at the Fair the Blot on the Scutcheon for the lyric There s a Woman Like a Dewdrop and Meeting at Night and Parting at Morning and Oh to be in England So that as things go we may be said never to have read any Browning at all I do not mean to say that what 1 did read did not influence me so that even at this late date that influence may be found in such a poem as To all the Dead or The Starling Influences are queer things and there is no knowing when or where they may take you But until the other day I should have said   Impressionism Some Speculations  that Browning was the last of the poets that I should have taken consciously as a model The other day however about a month ago my wife insisted sorely against my wishes on reading to me the beginning of The Flight of the Duchess as far as And the whole is our Duke s country that most triumphant expression of feudal loyalty And my enthusiasm knew no bounds so that if ever the Muse should visit me again it may well be Browningese that I shall write for there is no passage in literature that I should more desire to have written  But at any rate the attempt to read Tennyson Swinburne and Browning and Pope in our teens gave me and the friends I have mentioned a settled dislike for poetry that we have never since quite got over We seemed to get from them the idea that all poets must of necessity write affectedly at great length with many superfluous words that poetry of necessity was something boring and pretentious And I fancy that it is because the greater parr of humanity got that impression from those poets that few modern men or women read verse at all  To such an extent did that feeling overmaster us that although we subsequently discovered for ourselves Christina Rossetti who strikes us still as far and away the greatest master of words and moods that any art has produced I am conscious that we regarded her as being far   POETRY A Magatine of Verse  more a prose writer than a poet at all Poetry being something pretentious tol lol as the phrase then was poe tentous brow beating affected this still small private voice gave the impression of not being verse at all Such a phrase describing lizards amongst heath as like darted lightnings here and there perceived yet nowhere dwelt upon or such a sentence as Quoth one to morrow shall be like to day but much more sweet these things gave an exquisite pleasure but it was a pleasure comparable rather to that to be had from reading Flaubert It was comparable rather to that which came from reading the last sentences of Herodias Et tous ayant pris la tete de Jokanaan s en allaient vers Galillée Comme elle était très lourde ils la portaient alternativement I do not presume to say exactly whence the pleasure comes except in so far as that I believe that such exact formal and austere phrases can to certain men give a pleasure beyond any other And it was this emotion that we received  from Christina Rossetti  But still subconsciously I am aware that we did not regard her as a poet  And from that day onwards I may say that we have read no poetry at all at any rate we have read none un professionally until just the other day The poets of the nineties Dowson Johnson Davidson and the rest struck us as just nuisances writing in derivative language uninteresting matters that might have been interesting   Impressionism Some Speculations  had they been expressed in the much more exquisite medium of prose We got perhaps some pleasure from reading the poems not the novels of George Meredith and a great deal from those of Mr Hardy whom we do regard as a great queer gloomy and splendid poet We read also by some odd impulse the whole of Mr Doughty s Dawn in Britain that atrocious and wonderful epic in twelve volumes which is we think the longest and most queerly impressive poem in modern English We read it with avidity we could not tear ourselves away from it and we wrote six reviews of it because no professional reviewers could be found to give the time for reading it It was a queer adventure  That then is the history of twenty years of reading verse and I think I may say that for men whose life business is reading we have read practically no poetry at all And during those twenty years we should have said with assurance that poetry was an artificial a boring an unnecessary thing  But about five years ago we began to think of founding a periodical one is always thinking of founding periodicals We had then to think of what place verse must take in the scheme of things With our foreign ideas in which academic palms and precedence figure more strongly than they do in the minds of most freeborn islanders ir did not take us long to arrive at the conclusion that poetry must have the very first place in that journal not because it was a living force but just   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  because it was dead and must be treated with deference Moreover if I may make a further confession our express aim in founding the periodical in question was to print a poem by Mr Hardy a poem that other periodicals had found too let us say outspoken for them to print Now it would have been ridiculous to found an immense paper for the express purpose of printing one particular poem and not to have given that poem the utmost pride of place  So we printed A Sunday Morning Tragedy first and the rest in a string after it It seemed proper French and traditional to do so  And then we began to worry our poor heads about poetry We had perforce to read a great deal of it and much of what we read seemed to be better stuff than we had expected We came for instance upon the poems of Mr Yeats Now for ten or twenty years we had been making light of Mr Yeats we used to sniff irritably at I will arise and go now and to be worried by The Countess Kathleen Mr Yeats appeared to be a merely literary poet an annoying dilettante I do not now know whether Mr Yeats has changed or whether we have but I am about in a moment to try to make an amende honorable  At any rate we came upon the work of Mr Yeats of Mr De la Mare of Mr Flint of Mr D H Lawrence and upon suggestions of power in Mr Pound s derivations   Impressionism Some Speculations  from the Romance writers And gradually it has forced itself upon us that there is a new quality a new power of impressionism that is open to poetry and not so much open to prose It is a quality that attracted us years ago to the poems of Mr Hardy and of George Meredith I know that my younger friends will start ominously at this announcement that they will come round to my house and remonstrate seriously for many weary hours But I must make the best of that  For the fact is that in Mr Yeats as in Mr Hardy there are certain qualities that very singularly unite them qualities not so much of diction or of mind but qualities that can only be expressed in pictorial terms For when I think of Mr Hardy s work I seem to see a cavernous darkness a darkness filled with wood smoke touched here and there with the distant and brooding glow of smothered flame When I think of Mr Yeats work I seem to see a grey thin mist over a green landscape the mist here and there being pierced by a sparkle of dew by the light shot from a gem in a green cap I have tried to write this as carefully as I can so as to express very precisely what is in the end a debt of sheer gratitude I mean that really and truly that is the sort of feeling that I have as if I had discovered two new countries the country of the hardly illumined and cavernous darkness the country of the thin grey mist over the green fields and as f those countries still remained for me to travel in   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  It will at first sight appear that here is a contradicting of the words with which we set out the statement that it is the duty of the poet to reflect his own day But there is no contradiction It is the duty of the poet to reflect his own day as it appears to him as it has impressed itself upon him Because 1 and my friends have as the saying is rolled our humps mostly in a landscape that is picked out with red patches of motor bus sides it would be the merest provincialism to say that the author of Innisfree should not have sate in the cabins of County Galway or of Connemara or wherever it is or that the author of the Dynasts should not have wandered about a country called Wessex reading works connected with Napoleon We should not wish to limit Mr Yeats reading to the Daily Papers nor indeed do we so limit our own any more than we should wish to limit the author of that most beautiful impression The Listeners to the purlieus of Bedford Street where the publishers offices are  What worried and exasperated us in the poems of the late Lord Tennyson the late Lewis Morris the late William Morris the late well whom you like is not their choice of subject it is their imitative handling of matter of words it is their derivative attitude  Reading is an excellent thing it is also experience and both Mr Yeats and Mr De la Mare have read a great deal But it is an experience that one should go through   Impressionism Some Speculations  not in order to acquire imitative faculties but in order to find oneself Roughly speaking the late Victorian writers imitated Malory or the Laxdaela Saga and commented upon them roughly speaking again the poets of today record their emotions at receiving the experience of the emotions of former writers  The measure of the truth has to be found It would be an obvious hypocrisy in men whose first unashamed action of the day is to open the daily paper for the cricket scores and whose poetic bag and baggage is as small as I have related it would be an obvious hypocrisy in us to pretend to have passed the greater part of our existences in romantic woods But it would be a similar hypocrisy in Mr De la Mare Mr Yeats or Mr Hardy to attempt to render Life in the terms of the sort of Futurist picture that life is to me and my likes  But to get a sort of truth a sort of genuineness into your attitude towards the life that God makes you lead to follow up your real preferences to like as some of us like the hard bitter ironical German poets the life of restaurants of Crowds of flashed impressions to love as we may love in our own way the Blessed Virgin Saint Katharine or the sardonic figure of Christina of Milan and to render it that is one good thing Or again to be genuinely Irish with all the historic background of death swords flames mists sorrows wakes and again mists to love those things and the Irish sanctities and Paganisms   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  that is another good thing if it is truly rendered The main thing is the genuine love and the faithful rendering of the received impression  The actual language the vernacular employed is a secondary matter I prefer personally the language of my own day a language clear enough for certain matters employing slang where slang is felicitous and vulgarity where it seems to me that vulgarity is the only weapon against dullness Mr Doughty on the other hand and Mr Doughty is a great poet uses a barbarous idiom as if he were chucking pieces of shale at you from the top of a rock Mr Yeats makes literal translations from the Irish Mr Hardy does not appear to bother his head much about words he drags them in as he likes Mr De la Mare and Mr Flint are rather literary Mr Pound as often as not is so unacquainted with English idioms as to he nearly unintelligible  God forbid by the bye that I should seem to arrogate to myself a position as a poet side by side with Mr De la Mare or for the matter of that with Mr Pound But in stating my preferences I am merely quite humbly trying to voice what I imagine will be the views or the aspirations the preferences or the prejudices of the poet of my day and circumstances when he shall at least appear and voice the life of dust toil discouragement excitement and enervation that 1 and many millions lead today  When that poet does come it seems to me that his  species will be much that of the gentlemen I have several   Impressionism Same Speculations  times mentioned His attitude towards life will be theirs his circumstances only will be different An elephant is an elephant whether he pours at an African water hole mud and water over his free and scorched flanks or whether in the Zoological Gardens he carries children about upon his back Ford Madox Hueffer  Myself and I by Fannie Stearns Davis Macmillan This book shows a charming lyrical fancy Poems such as Hill Fantasy and the first of the Songs of Conn ike Fool are excellent and original In Conn the idea of the poet s mission being to steal the moon in order to plant its seeds and grow more moons for a clamoring world expresses an old belief under quite a new figure The metre of Hill Fantasy gives the swing and lilt of the pipe music about which it sings It is also a relief this unusual metre in a volume of much metrical sameness Miss Davis is a pioneer in neither ideas nor verse forms She follows a well beaten track tripping along it with dainty feminine feet Hers is a delicate talent made up of careful observation of nature and a fine taste for beauty Some of her expressions are a keen pleasure Gown of shoal sea green Till the blue air crackled like a frost film on a pool A little white moon like a twisted thread All of these show a rare gift of imagination and the teal poetic quality of stamping the idea into words Miss Davis plays a graceful little tune on a silver stringed lute But it is only one tune and her lute   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  is only one instrument In Myself and I she laments the lack of courage which prevents her from following her vision and resigns herself to the compromise of keeping the vision as a solace while lingering in the sober road One cannot help hoping that with so much talent I will permit herself to broaden and deepen mentally under the tutelage of Myself so that the melody of the lute may widen to the full toned orchestra of a larger sympathy and a greater range of joy and sorrow But even as it is and in spite of much repetition this book contains poems which give great pleasure and a sense of satisfaction Amy Lowell  Art and Swadeshi by Ananda K Coomaraswamy  D Sc pub Ganesh amp Co Madras With numerous reproductions of Indian works of art  This inspiriting book contains two chapters on poetry one on the repertoire of a Panjabi singer with translations of lines not unworthy of the Greek Anthology one on Rabindranath Tagore The translations are slightly marred by inversions by too frequent use of the second person
