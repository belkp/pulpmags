again the  Coles Dressed but dishevelled from some hours of sleep Meserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore  Meserve was first to speak He pointed backward Over his shoulder with his pipe stem saying You can just see it glancing off the roof Making a great scroll upward toward the sky Long enough for recording all our names on I think I ll just call up my wife and tell her I m here so far and starting on again I ll call her softly so that if she s wise And gone to sleep she needn t wake to answer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Three times he barely stirred the bell then listened Why Lett still up Lett I m at Cole s I m late I called you up to say good night from here Before I went to say good morning there I thought I would I know but Lett I know I could but what s the sense The rest won t be So bad Give me an hour for it Ho ho Three hours to here But that was all up hill The rest is down Why no no not a wallow They kept their heads and took their time to it Like darlings both of them They re in the barn My dear I m coming just the same I didn t Call you to ask you to invite me home  He lingered for some word she wouldn t say Said it at last himself Good night and then Getting no answer closed the telephone The three stood in the lamplight round the table With lowered eyes a moment till he said I ll just see how the horses are  Yes do Both the Coles said together Mrs Cole Added You can judge better after seeing I want you here with me Fred Leave him here Brother Meserve You know to find your way Out through the shed  I guess I know my way I guess I know where I can find my name   Carved in the shed to tell me who I am If it don t tell me where I am I used To play  You tend your horses and come back Fred Cole you re going to let him Well aren t you How can you help yourself I called him Brother Why did I call him that  It s right enough That s all you ever heard him called round here He seems to have lost off his Christian name  Christian enough I should call that myself He took no notice did he Well at least I didn t use it out of love of him The dear knows I detest the thought of him With his ten children under ten years old I hate his wretched little Racker Sect All s ever I heard of it which isn t much But that s not saying Look Fred Cole it s twelve Isn t it now He s been here half an hour He says he left the village store at nine Three hours to do four miles a mile an hour Or not much better Why it doesn t seem As if a man could move that slow and move Try to think what he did with all that time And three miles more to go   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Don t let him go Stick to him Helen Make him answer you That sort of man talks straight on all his life From the last thing he said himself stone deaf To anything anyone else may say I should have thought though you could make him hear  you  What is he doing out a night like this Why can t he stay at home He had to preach It s no night to be out He may be small He may be good but one thing s sure he s tough  And strong of stale tobacco  He ll pull through You only say so Not another house Or shelter to put into from this place To theirs I m going to call his wife again  Wait and he may Let s see what he will do Let s see if he will think of her again But then I doubt he s thinking of himself He doesn t look on it as anything  He shan t go there It is a night my dear  One thing he didn t drag God into it   He don t consider it a case for God  You think so do you You don t know the kind He s getting up a miracle this minute Privately to himself right now he s thinking He ll make a case of it if he succeeds But keep still if he fails  Keep still all over He ll be dead dead and buried  Such a trouble Not but I ve every reason not to care What happens to him if it only takes Some of the sanctimonious conceit Out of one of those pious scalawags  Nonsense to that You want to see him safe  You like the runt Don t you a little  Well I don t like what he s doing which is what You like and like him for  Oh yes you do You like your fun as well as anyone Only you women have to put these airs on To impress men You ve got us so ashamed Of being men we can t look at a good fight Between two boys and not feel bound to stop it   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Let the man freeze an ear or two I say He s here I leave him all to you Go in And save his life All right come in Meserve Sit down sit down How did you find the horses  Fine fine And ready for some more My wife here Says it won t do You ve got to give it up  Won t you to please me Please If I say please Mr Meserve I ll leave it to your wife What did your wife say on the telephone  Meserve seemed to heed nothing but the lamp Or something not far from it on the table By straightening out and lifting a forefinger He pointed with his hand from where it lay Like a white crumpled spider on his knee That leaf there in your open book It moved Just then I thought It s stood erect like that There on the table ever since I came Trying to turn itself backward or forward I ve had my eye on it to make out which If forward then it s with a friend s impatience You see I know to get you on to things It wants to see how you will take if backward It s from regret for something you have passed And failed to see the good of Never mind   Snow  Things must expect to come in front of us A many times I don t say just how many That varies with the things before we see them One of the lies would make it out that nothing Ever presents itself before us twice Where would we be at last if that were so Our very life depends on everything s Recurring till we answer from within The thousandth time may prove the charm That leaf It can t turn either way It needs the wind s help But the wind didn t move it if it moved It moved itself The wind s at naught in here It couldn t stir so sensitively poised A thing as that It couldn t reach the lamp To get a puff of black smoke from the flame Or blow a rumple in the collie s coat You make a little foursquare block of air Quiet and light and warm in spite of all The illimitable dark and cold and storm And by so doing give these three lamp dog And book leaf that keep near you their repose Though for all anyone can tell repose May be the thing you haven t yet you give it So false it is that what we haven t we can t give So false that what we always say is true I ll have to turn the leaf if no one else will It won t lie down Then let it stand Who cares   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I shouldn t want to hurry you Meserve But if you re going Say you ll stay you know But let me raise this curtain on a scene And show you how it s piling up against you You see the snow white through the white of frost Ask Helen how far up the sash it s climbed Since last we read the gage  It looks as if Some pallid thing had squashed its features flat And its eyes shut with overeagerness To see what people found so interesting In one another and had gone to sleep Of its own stupid lack of understanding Or broken its white neck of mushroom stuff Short off and died against the window pane  Brother Meserve take care you ll scare yourself More than you will us with such nightmare talk It s you it matters to because it s you Who have to go out into it alone  Let him talk Helen and perhaps he ll stay  Before you drop the curtain I m reminded You recollect the boy who came out here To breathe the air one winter had a room Down at the Avery s Well one sunny morning After a downy storm he passed our place   Snow  And found me banking up the house with snow And I was burrowing in deep for warmth Piling it well above the window sills The snow against the window caught his eye Hey that s a pretty thought those were his words So you can think it s six feet deep outside While you sit warm and read up balanced rations You can t get too much winter in the winter Those were his words And he went home and all But banked the daylight out of Avery s windows Now you and I would go to no such length At the same time you can t deny it makes It not a mite worse sitting here we three Playing our fancy to have the snow line run So high across the pane outside There where There is a sort of tunnel in the frost Alore like a tunnel than a hole way down At the far end of it you see a stir And quiver like the frayed edge of the drift Blown in the wind I like that I like that Well now I leave you people  Come Meserve We thought you were deciding not to go The ways you found to say the praise of comfort And being where you are You want to stay  I ll own it s cold for such a fall of snow This house is frozen brittle all except   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  This room you sit in If you think the wind Sounds further off it s not because it s dying You re further under in the snow that s all And feel it less Hear the soft bombs of dust It bursts against us at the chimney mouth And at the eaves I like it from inside More than I shall out in it But the horses Are rested and it s time to say good night And let you get to bed again Good night Sorry I had to break in on your sleep  Lucky for you you did Lucky for you You had us for a half way station To stop at If you were the kind of man Paid heed to women you d take my advice And for your family s sake stay where you are But what good is my saying it over and over You ve done more than you had a right to think You could do now You know the risk you take In going on  Our snow storms as a rule Aren t looked on as man killers and although I d rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep Under it all his door sealed up and lost Than the man fighting it to keep above it Yet think of the small birds at roost and not In nests Shall I be counted less than they are Their bulk in water would be frozen rock   Snow  In no time out to night And yet to morrow They will come budding boughs from tree to tree Flirting their wings and saying Chicadee As if not knowing what you meant by the word storm  But why when no one wants you to go on Your wife she doesn t want you to We don t And you yourself don t want to Who else is there  Save us from being cornered by a woman Well there s She told Fred afterward that in The pause right there she thought the dreaded word Was coming God But no he only said Well there s the storm That says I must go on That wants me as a war might if it came Ask any man  He threw her that as something To last her till he got outside the door He had Cole with him to the barn to see him off When Cole returned he found his wife still standing Beside the table near the open book Not reading it  Well what kind of a man Do you call that she said He had the gift Of words or is it tongues I ought to say  Was ever such a man for seeing likeness   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Or disregarding people s civil questions What We ve found out in one hour more about him Than we had seeing him pass by in the road A thousand times If that s the way he preaches You didn t think you d keep him after all Oh I m not blaming you He didn t leave you Much say in the matter and I m just as glad We re not in for a night of him No sleep If he had stayed The least thing set him going It s quiet as an empty church without him  But how much better off are we as it is We ll have to sit here till we know he s safe  Yes I suppose you ll want to but I shouldn t He knows what he can do or he wouldn t try Get into bed I say and get some rest He won t come back and if he telephones It won t be for an hour or two  Well then We can t be any help by sitting here And living his fight through with him I suppose  Cole had been telephoning in the dark  Mrs Cole s voice came from an inner room Did she call you or you call her   She me You d better dress you won t go back to bed We must have been asleep it s three and after  Had she been ringing long I ll get my wrapper I want to speak to her All she said was He hadn t come and had he really started  She knew he had poor thing two hours ago  He had the shovel He ll have made a fight  Why did I ever let him leave this house  Don t begin that You did the best you could  To keep him though perhaps you didn t quite  Conceal a wish to see him show the spunk  To disobey you Much his wife ll thank you  Fred after all I said You shan t make out  That it was any way but what it was  Did she let on by any word she said  She didn t thank me  When I told her Gone Well then she said and Well then like a threat And then her voice came scraping slow Oh you Why did you let him go  Asked why we let him You let me there I ll ask her why she let him   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  She didn t dare to speak when he was here Their number s twenty one The thing won t work Someone s receiver s down The handle stumbles The stubborn thing the way it jars your arm It s theirs She s dropped it from her hand and gone  Try speaking Say Hello Hello hello What do you hear  I hear an empty room You know it sounds that way And yes I hear I think I hear a clock and windows rattling No step though If she s there she s sitting down  Shout she may hear you Shouting is no good Keep speaking then Hello Hello Hello You don t suppose She wouldn t go out doors  I m half afraid that s just what she might do  And leave the children  Wait and call again You can t hear whether she has left the door Wide open and the wind s blown out the lamp And the fire s died and the room s dark and cold  One of two things either she s gone to bed Or gone out doors   In which case both are lost Do you know what she s like Have you ever met her It s strange she doesn t want to speak to us  Fred see if you can hear what I hear Come  A clock maybe Don t you hear something else Not talking No Why yes I hear what is it What do you say it is A baby s crying  Frantic it sounds though muffled and far off  Its mother wouldn t let it cry like that Not if she s there What do you make of it  There s only one thing possible to make That is assuming that she has gone out Of course she hasn t though  They both sat down Helpless There s nothing we can do till morning  Fred I shan t let you think of going out  Hold on The double bell began to chirp They started up Fred took the telephone   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Hello Meserve You re there then And your wife Good Why I asked she didn t seem to answer He says she went to let him in the barn We re glad Oh say no more about it man  Drop in and see us when you re passing  Well She has him then though what she wants him for I don t see  Possibly not for herself Maybe she only wants him for the children  The whole to do seems to have been for nothing What spoiled our night was to him just his fun  What did he come in for To talk and visit Thought he d just call to tell us it was snowing  If he thinks he is going to make our house  A half way coffee house twixt town and nowhere  I thought you d feel you d been too much concerned  You think you haven t been concerned yourself  If you mean he was inconsiderate  To rout us out to think for him at midnight  And then take our advice no more than nothing  Why I agree with you But let s forgive him  We ve had a share in one night of his life  What ll you bet he ever calls again  Robert Frost   TO W J C October 5th 1848 September 19th I916  Why is it when they wreathe about your name Garlands of praise cry soldier diplomat Lover of justice statesman and enrich The pillage of their hearts with bitter tears For your great heart that beats no more Why do I see only that tilt of the lip And gleam of the eyes the sudden whimsical smile That used to break the grand lines of your face And hear only some little tender word Some love joke tripping up our futile pride With doubt of human grandeur  Sweet oh brave Oh brave and sweet through the strange sun shot maze You passed unwavering holding out your hands To give and bless freeing your eager mind In warm bold words opening wide your eyes To see the light follow the clearing path Out to great spaces  Go go forth They win you I see you there against the sunset glow Waving your hand smiling your quizzical smile What next I hear you say Then the sun flaunts Its crimson to the zenith and goes down To make another day And you are gone  Harriet Monroe POETRY A Magazine of Verse  OLD FOLK SONGS OF UKRAINA  THE KALINA  Was I not once the red cranberry By the river flowing My father s only child was I In his house growing  But they plucked the boughs of the Kalina They made great bunches Such is my fortune oh unhappy fortune  And on a day they

 A Painting by Kenzan  A pine branch stretches out Across the silence   Grey silence untroubled Until this living thing Smote it into music   The void is restless now Silence shall be no more Greyness shall be no more Nor any peace For a singing curve and color Have entered the vast dwelling A life singing Of the suns and the snows Now the old gods tremble In their timeless halls Now the far halls beyond Orion Are shaken with music For this chord living This soul that knows not peace This dream dust stretches out Across the silence   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  II PINES ON A MOUNTAIN  A Screen by Yeitoku  Red pine trunks Immutable pines Pillars upright under the grey sky Pillars upright over the chasmed earth Upon these snow heights Your downward sloping branches Point toward the human world Remote and troubled But here on the ultimate ramparts Of the winter hills Your huge columns Rise toward bleak heaven Like an indomitable procession Of warriors dark green crested To whom the snows Are only wine and trumpets To whom the winds Are only battle   The Wave Symphony  II I THE WAVE SYMPHONY  A Screen by Sotatsu  Around islands of jade and malachite And lapis lazuli and jasper Under golden clouds Struggle the grey gold waves  The waves are advancing Swirling eddying the pale waves Are leaping into foam and retreating And straining again until they seem not waves But gigantic crawling hands The waves clutch at the clouds The near and golden clouds They rise in spires over the clouds And over the pine branch set against the clouds And around the islands Jasper and jade Their rhythms circle and sweep and re echo With hollow and foam crest Infinitely interlacing their orbits and cycles That join and unravel and battle and answer From tumult to tumult from music to music Crest to trough foam height to hollow Peace drowning passion and passion Leaping from peace   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I V BUDDHA APPEARING FROM BEHIND MOUNTAINS  A Painting by Choga  Two hills meet Two dark green hills About their shoulders Silver mists cling  Slowly the gigantic Face of the Buddha In massive presence Looks over the hills Tranquil his brow unsmiling his lips Filling the whole sky with his haloes of glory He broods in a dream of gold Measureless peace sleeps on his golden forehead Measureless compassion Weighs on his eyes Yet as I look It seems that his terrible hidden hands Even now are stirring To rend apart the hills To divide the corrupt and cloven earth For the triumphal entry of his burning form  Arthur Davison Ficke   V NEW VERSE  LOVE SONG  What have I to say to you When we shall meet Yet I lie here thinking of you  The stain of love Is upon the world Yellow yellow yellow It eats into the leaves Smears with saffron The horned branches that lean Heavily Against a smooth purple sky  There is no light Only a honey thick stain That drips from leaf to leaf And limb to limb Spoiling the colors Of the whole world  I am alone The weight of love Has buoyed me up Till my head Knocks against the sky   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  See me My hair is dripping with nectar Starlings carry it On their black wings See at last My arms and my hands Are lying idle  How can I tell If I shall ever love you again As I do now  NAKED  What fool would feel His cheeks burn Because of the snow Would he call it By a name give it Breasts features Bare limbs Would he call it A woman  Surely then he would be A fool  And see her Warmed with the cold   Naked  Go upon the heads  Of creatures  Whose faces lean  To the ground  Would he watch The compassion of Her eyes That look now up Now down To the turn of The wind and The turn of The shivering minds She touches Motionless troubled  I ask you I ask you my townspeople What fool is this  Would he forget The sight of His mother and His wife Because of her Have his heart Turned to ice That will not soften   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  What Would he see a thing Lovelier than A high school girl With the

worshipper  William Carlos Williams   EDITORIAL COMMENT  TRUTH AND THE PARADOX  HERE are times when the beauty of life seems  too keen to be borne seasons of joy or sorrow  when the chaos of people and purposes as  sumes processional dignity and the babel of  tongues becomes a choral song It is as if one watched this earthly episode from some far planet of larger spaces and years and saw its criss cross of lines its blots and splashes of color merge into a noble pattern set for the delight of gods From that vantage ground lost meanings become clear the amazing effrontery of birth life s heroic and unsatisfied search the sudden silence of death the tumultuous movement of generations around the niggardly fruitful earth around a whirling ball suspended in space as by a single hair held to its course by an incredibly delicate balance of warring forces all these become an act of the eternal passion a thought of the infinite consciousness a daring flight of the universal spirit  T o be a part of it all to have lived in the solar nebula and resolved into the cloud bound earth to have quickened into the beginnings of life and spawned and struggled through experimental ages to have groped outward through fish and beast and bird beating against barriers blindly denying denial unconsciously seeking consciousness to be born at last into a being erect and sensient who gathers and records knowledge who feels beauty even to   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the rapture of song the ecstasy of art who knows himself a little and gives that little away in love who apprehends the truth a little in poignant suffering and joy and finally to challenge the infinite with new demands that would make of our life an antechamber and our death a gateway that would round out the mighty circle of existence to the remotest agony of truth to be a part of this colossal movement is a destiny so sublime as to be beyond the reach of deliberate thought conceivable only in rare and sudden emotions that come unbidden in moments of intense illumination  The mystery is not the greatness of life but its littleness That we so grandly born so mightily endowed should grope with blind eyes and bound limbs in the dust and mire of petty desires and grievances until we can hardly see the blue of the sky or the glory of the seasons until we can hardly clasp our neighbor s hand or hear his voice this is the inexplicable mystery the blasting unreality the bitter falsehood that underlies all the dark evils of the world  H M  POEM GAMES  On the evenings of November twenty sixth and twenty ninth Mr Vachel Lindsay and Miss Eleanor Dougherty will give together at the Chicago Little Theatre a presentation of a few of the former s poems the poet chanting the words while the dancer interprets them At least this will be the formula with The King of Yellow Butterflies The Tree of   Poem games  Laughing Bells and The Potatoes Dance In King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba and Aladdin and the Jinn the poet promises to take a certain co operative part in the acting though never bringing myself forward as anything much more than the prestidigitator who brings the dove from the hat or the ambassador between the poem and its interpreter In the case of these two poems the audience is expected to join in the chorus as many audiences have done in various towns even without Miss Dougherty to lead them  Last summer when I saw an early rehearsal of these poem games I found the performance very beautiful and novel This was somewhat to my surprise because I had feared an effect of incongruity It was a gay and delicate blending of the two arts like dancing to music or singing with an orchestral accompaniment  For precedents one must go back to English folk games of the seventeenth century and earlier which have died out in England but which still survive among Carolina and Tennessee mountaineers this according to Mr Cecil J Sharp of the English Folk Dance Society and the Stratford on Avon School of Folk Song and Dance who has been lecturing in this country Recent studies of the verse and action games of these mountaineers have convinced him that they preserve intact English folk games of the period of ancestral emigration to America  Mr Lindsay would seem to be working toward a new development of this art of long ago which he enriches by using the dance in addition to gesture marching and pos   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  turing Indeed he says It is my hope that this work brings my verses a little nearer to the old precedents of folk dancing and folk lore And it all follows the suggestion made to the Illinois poet by Mr Yeats over two years ago to restore the primitive singing of poetry H M  REVIEWS  MR HAGEDORN S CLYTEMNESTRA  The Great Maze and The Heart of Youth a Poem and a  Play by Hermann Hagedorn Macmillan Co  The long poem in five parts which opens this volume retells in full swinging blank verse the old story of Agamemnon s return and death  The poet s motive in using this ancient tale seems to be a new interpretation of the character of Clytemnestra The queen kills her husband not because she wants to but because she doesn t want to not because she hates him and loves Aegisthus but because she loves him and despises Aegisthus with whom she had dallied for years merely to pass the time and dull her longing for her royal lord She lays down the law thus to Aegisthus  Not fear or love or you or Agamemnon Shall have the power to crush me or deride Condemn me or forgive I will not bow I will not be raised up I will not drink Mercy from any lips My days are mine And I will keep the government of them I am the Queen I am not moved I move   Mr Hagedorn s Clytemnestra  Unwilling to accept forgiveness and reinstatement from the man whom she loves and who loves her she uses her baser lover to kill him  Now this may or may not be a plausible modern reading of Clytemnestra s motive It seems to me a bit strained a motive which might lead to suicide but hardly to murder and in its high sounding presentation the old sculpturesque royalty of the queen seems to disappear I wonder in following it whether in spite of the Great War we of this twentieth century have lost our approach to our belief in stark and simple tragic passion like that which the elder poets and the world in general long granted to Clytemnestra Orestes Judith Lady Macbeth and other famous murderers of history or legend But my chief objection to Mr Hagedorn s idea of Clytemnestra is not any questioning of his competence or of the truth or falsehood the strength or weakness of modern studies of human motives but a deep rooted objection to the misuse by any modern mind of a great typical figure to express an idea contrary to that which it has always embodied and to which it is in a sense sacred  I own to extreme impatience when a modern poet would persuade us for example that Judith fell in love with Holofernes or Jael with Sisera before she slew him Are there not enough amorous women in ancient and modern times whom our poets may study to their hearts content Why should they lay violent hands on these two warrior women long sacred in the imagination of many nations as   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  expressing to the extreme degree the tribal impulse of patriotism The warrior woman is an authentic type examples of her may be found today much nearer home than Serbia where she has been quite recently conspicuous in battle beside her brothers Can our poets no longer recognize and appreciate this type that they should violate the old biblical tradition and try to add two great Amazons to the long list of amorous heroines  In the same way Mr Hagedorn lays violent and sacrilegious hands on Clytemnestra To the Greek poets who created her out of more or less historic legend she was a starkly simple example of the amorous woman who stops at nothing even the murder of a king to rid herself and her lover of an avenging intruder These poets enshrined her figure indestructibly in that form and any modern effort even the ablest to reshape her is as futile as would be the chisel of Rodin on the great portal of the cathedral of Chartres Rodin however would know enough and feel enough not to attempt it  There are modern women who might set forth effectively Mr Hagedorn s idea which is a good enough idea in its way Only none of these has yet acquired a glamour which makes the world instinctively take the poet s word for her beauty and royalty instinctively believe him when he tells us of her enigmatic eyes the vast black night of her eyes or of her  April moods Of swan like queenliness afloat on dreams The poet who chooses a figure long enshrined gives himself   Mr Hagedorn s Clytemnestra  the advantage of the tradition even while he violates the tradition and saves himself the trouble of complete creation  Mr Hagedorn s diction is fairly modern in spite of two or three deems modern enough to admit the word daddy on little Electra s lips But the dialogue of which most of the poem is composed is undramatic it misses the quality of speech  The Heart of Youth is a picturesque mediaeval play with which the boys of the Hill School dedicated their out door theatre last year It is unpretentious simple and sweet and should be effective when played by boys or girls or both It ends with a fine moment when the crowd seeking and singing surge forth with torches into the night  H M  A DECADE OF GIBSON  Battle and Other Poems by Wilfrid Wilson Gibson Mac  millan Co  This book enables one to compare Mr Gibson s present with his past for the war poems are new while the six brief plays which fill more than half the volume were first printed in 1906  Even at that time the poet had chosen his theme the life of the poor in rural England and had stript his blank verse down to the barest simplicity Though the little plays or rather dramatic episodes are perhaps over deliberate and their technique is yet not quite free one feels in them   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  spiritual intuition and a depth of yearning sympathy with the harsh struggles and keen joys and sorrows of simple folk who live close to the niggardly fruitful earth and to animals Ruth coming home through the bitter snow to bear the child of a vagabond lover bends lovingly over a weak little new born lamb  Ah what a night to come into the world Poor motherless thing and those poor patient mothers I might have known it was the lambing storm  And Esther Shield just wedded undaunted by her mother in law s story of her own tragic marriage and prophecy of woe turns in triumph to her ardent young mate saying  I shall bide I have heard all and yet I would not go Nor would I have a single word unsaid I loved you husband yet I did not know you Until your mother spoke I know you now And I am not afraid  But still more interesting are the Battle lyrics surer in technique more mature in the handling of character In fact with the single exception of the Brooke sonnets they are the truest and most poignant war poems we have had thus far from any English poet expressing the vast unreason of war through the stark irony and savage simplicity of the common soldier s or refugee s reaction Readers of POETRY will remember many of these withering songs which like a flame light up the sudden and perishing emotion Here is one they missed called Salvage  So suddenly her life Had crashed about that gray old country wife   A Decade of Gibson  Naked she stood and gazed Bewildered while her home about her blazed New widowed and bereft Of her five sons she clung to what was left Still hugging all she d got A toy gun and a copper coffee pot  The effect of this group of poems like that of the finest American poem of this war Miss Driscoll s Metal Checks is to put out of date forever the romance the glory of battle that ancient glamour which has been celebrated in song since Homer and which Rupert Brooke like a modern troubadour set to the music of an ancient harp as he marched to his death The poet who truly represents this age sings another tune He expresses that bitter brooding in the depths of every heroic modern heart the feeling that in war as the London Times reviewer says there are no longer men there is no longer man there are only sports of chance pullers of triggers bewildered fulfillers of instructions cynical acceptors of destiny  The book includes also in the section Friends the group of fine sonnets which we recently printed and a few memorial and personal poems Among the latter is this one called  Marriage  Going my way of old Contented more or less I dreamt not life could hold Such happiness  I dreamt not that love s way Could keep the golden height Day after happy day Night after night  H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TANGLED TREES  Trees by Harold Monro Poetry Bookshop London  Trees the title makes me think of John Muir of happy memory and his wonderful love of trees It passed the love of brothers it was a proud rapture of understanding a mystic spiritual communion like the intimacy of a mediaeval saint with archangels Trees were his archangels ranged in shining ranks about the throne of God and mercifully gathering at their feet the races of men and interceding for them with the Most High From the little quivering aspen tender as a fawn to the sequoia gigantea noble as a mountain he knew them to their deepest secrets and loved them in his deepest heart  Well Mr Monro loves trees too in his odd and ingenious way He says Tree life is like a corridor between The Seen and the Unseen Indeed he almost makes of their love an immorality Grip hard become a root so drive Your muscles through the ground alive That you ll be breaking from above your knees Out into branches Thus he forces himself into tree life Then The trees throw up their singing leaves and climb Spray over spray They break through Time Their roots lash through the clay They lave The earth and wash along the ground They burst in green wave over wave Fly in a blossom of light foam Rank following windy rank they come They flood the plain Swill through the valley top the mound   Tangled Trees  Flow over the low hill Curl round The bases of the mountain fill Their crevices and stain Their ridges green  But the poet kept too much mortality  They drove me forth The angry trees Roared till I tumbled lean and lewd Out of that Paradise The forest rose To scourge my wavering conscience and pursued  But though driven forth he we cannot escape them  How beautifully they grow Crowding the brink of silence everywhere  Yet they leave their proper place  They follow us and haunt us We must build  Houses of wood  and fill them with fragments of the forest chairs tables  doors etc Others we put to sleep under railroad tracks And some some trees before they die Carved and moulded small Suddenly begin Oh what a wild and windy woodland call Out of the lips of the violin  Such is the argument of this curiously subtle poem Orig  inal it is beyond question and sometimes beautiful but  Mr Monro s forest would be too uncanny too sophisticated  for John Muir By way of moral we have a cryptic couplet at the end  And you be certain that you keep  Some memory of trees for sleep The book is a beautiful limited edition all done by hand  at the Temple Sheen Press It has decorative wood cuts   POETRY A Magazine of Verse at least they look like old wood cuts by James Guthrie  the designs a clever cross between Blake and Morris Why do they do these things so much better in England H M  STEPHENS ROAD TO DUBLIN  The Rocky Road to Dublin by James Stephens Macmillan Co To sit down to review James Stephens is much like being  asked to furnish a recipe for making star dust or to analyze the shivering beauty of the dawn His work has the peculiarly Celtic quality of existing in space completely divorced from the world as we know it His beauty comes to us faintly filtered through the simple words of every day speech which yet as he writes them are no longer the words we know but subtle delicate shimmering things full of gray undertones swift flashes of silver humor and wisdom from some other world To the many who love his work it is something beyond reason and analysis something to be accepted joyfully as wild flowers and meadow larks are accepted and loved as instinctively  This for instance called The Secret I was frightened for a wind Crept along the grass to say Something that was in my mind Yesterday  Something that I did not know Could be found out by the wind I had buried it so low In my mind   Stephens Road to Dublin  Or this delectable bit The Fur Coat  I walked out in my Coat of Pride  I looked about on every side  And said the mountains should not be  Just where they were and that the sea  Was badly placed and that the beech  Should be an oak and then from each  I turned in dignity as if  They were not there I sniffed a sniff  And climbed upon my sunny shelf  And sneezed a while and scratched myself  The Rocky Road to Dublin however in spite of its beauty goes to prove definitely what Songs from the Clay had suggested that Mr Stephens is more of a poet in his prose than in his verse In the forever inimitable Crock of Gold one of the most fascinating books in English and in The Demigods although writing in prose he is the ideal poet tender mystical witty and quite himself In his poetry he has not yet quite found that self He remains a little uncertain And why oh why has he altered the haunting little poem Hawks published long ago in POETRY to the present insufficient version  Yet as there can be only one Synge so there can only be one James Stephens Let us sing a little chant to the leprecauns in his honor E T  OTHER BOOKS OF VERSE  Turns and Movies and Other Tales in Verse by Conrad  Aiken The New Poetry Series Houghton Mifflin Co  If Masefield and W W Gibson Frost and Masters the whole company of story tellers in verse today had never   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  written there is small doubt that Turns and Movies would prove Conrad Aiken an authentic poet But as it is their unquiet ghosts stalk behind his work Gibson most prominent in this volume Masefield in Earth Triumphant  This is the more unfortunate because Mr Aiken has invention vividness compression and at times a pleasing lyric quality His situations are real situations swiftly told his technique easy and effective It is hard to say just where the authenticity seeps out yet the total effect is that of a clever craftsman working well in the medium of his day yet never quite reaching to the heights  The poems in this book are unusually even in quality and it is difficult to choose between them Perhaps Discordants Boardman and Coffin and one numbered simply XIII art the most successful They are too long to quote but the following Duval s Birds is typical of the volume  The parrot screeching flew out into the darkness Circled three times above the upturned faces With a great whir of brilliant outspread wings And then returned to stagger on her finger She bowed and smiled eliciting applause The property man hated her dirty birds But it had taken years yes years to train them To shoulder flags strike bells by tweaking strings Or climb sedately little flights of stairs When they were stubborn she tapped them with a wand And her eyes glittered a little under the eyebrows The red one flapped and flapped on a swinging wire The little white ones winked round yellow eves  E T   Other Books of Verse  Songs of Armageddon and Other Poems by George Syl  vester Viereck Mitchell Kennerley  This volume is typical of the later Viereck full of wind and words and the lure of scented flesh That the war poems should be propaganda not poetry is pardonable Better poets than he have lost their vision of art in the hot breath of war But that he who had in his youth one of the purest lyric gifts of our day should come before he is forty to the feeble puerilities of the love poems in this volume is indeed pitiful In the grave of the flesh Mr Viereck has buried his talent For the rest a merciful silence is best E T  CLASSICS IN ENGLISH  The Poets Translation Series I VI The Egoist London The translators of this series have an opportunity which most of them have neglected H D is the exception  Gilbert Murray has struck at Greek scholarship and done no good to English verse Euripides for the working man at a shilling the play in the style of fifty years ago an ideal of socialism and popular education Greek without tears The only result can be still greater neglect of Greek in our schools Why study Greek when an adequate translation can always be had cheap and easy scholarship for the busy man There are translations for the scholar the splendid Oxford Aristotle but these do not pretend to be literature And what is scholarship is an introduction and commentary for the original what is literature is enrichment of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  English by contact with Greek a criticism of one language by another a fertilisation But there is no substitute no adequate translation  Some of these translators have fallen into the abyss of Murray Mr Aldington s Anyte is good but hardly ever steps aside from the path of Mackail There is no use in merely multiplying translations of Greek epigrams which after all belong rather to the art of epigraphy than to literature The Greeks like the Italians put intelligence upon monuments If our tombstone artists could study Greek but this is a divagation  H D is a poet She has at least avoided the traditional jargon prescribed for translators she has turned Euripides into English verse which can be taken seriously verse of our own time as modern as was Swinburne s when it appeared Her verse is a perversion of the opposite extreme Swinburne is too fluid H D too abrupt The participle becomes an indicative most of the I saw and I heard drop out the chorus becomes an independent poem Her type of verse makes her task the more difficult It relies upon a succession of images and the images of the Greek tragedian were made up of stock phrases rearranged Thus she is compelled sometimes to lose contact with the original in avoiding clichés  A flash Achilles passed along the beach Achilles had strapped the wind About his ankles   Euripides says only that the women saw Achilles swift running swift as the wind It would be impossible to find   Classics in English  equivalents for swift as the wind and swift running and escape redundancy This sort of improvement is permissible but only marks time it does not enrich English from Greek And in a few cases where Euripides style is merely bald the alteration is not an improvement I keep the memory of the assembled army becomes My mind is graven with ships with obvious loss of dignity And in the translation  There is no power but in base men Nor any man whom the gods do not hate the meaning is completely perverted Euripides has made the characteristic remark that men should not strive to be illustrious in virtue in the Greek sense lest they bring down on themselves the invidia of the gods Again Each man is marked for his toil Much labor is his fate Nor is there any new hurt That may be added to the race  is not only a similar mistranslation but fails to rise quite to what is the emotional crisis of the play  Still it is a great deal to have translations that one can read translations into the language of contemporary verse even if H D s monotonously short lines with excess of stops and defect of connectives are sometimes tiring to eye and ear And often she does succeed in bringing something out of the Greek language to the English in an immediate contact which gives life to both the contact which makes it possible for the modern language perpetually to draw sustenance from the dead  May no child of mine  Nor any child of my child   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Ever fashion such a tale As the Phrygians shall murmur As they stoop at their distaffs Whispering with Lydians Splendid with weight of gold   The translations of Sappho and Leonidas do not deserve mention Some of the Latin poetry of the Renaissance which Mr Aldington gives us is translated for the first time and some may be found in Mr Pound s Spirit of Romance Mr Flint has done a service in translating the Mosella but is not a boat propelled with oars the same thing as a row boat T S Eliot  The Divine Comedy translated by Henry Johnson Yale  University Press  It is assuredly an honorable ambition that prompts one to the difficult and ungrateful task of translating metrically the entire Divine Comedy line for line and it is an honorable procedure to rely solely as Professor Johnson has done on one s control of the English medium unaided He has indeed been as faithful as he claims More he has shown himself sturdy dogged ploddingly professorially persistent He has made a real campaign like the British in Picardy a trench a day a town a week and on page 436 he reaches duly the church triumphant and the luce eterna  But a line for line translation of Dante must always tip toward prose The verbal glamour is necessarily lost the finely woven chain of the terza rima a web of steel and of flowers is sacrificed no less We are likely to have when all s done not the carved marbles of a Florentine duomo   Classics in English  but only a plain neat four square edifice in colonial brick not samite or cloth of gold but simple serge or cheviot not beccaficos or peacocks tongues but just everyday roast beef and boiled potatoes It cannot be said that the present translation seems less conscientiously humdrum than one in prose such as Norton s or one on the same line for line plan such as Longfellow s or one in short paragraphs of literal prose corresponding to each terzina such as the co operative version issued by Dent Indeed it would not be difficult to go farther and indicate passages where Professor Johnson has renounced advantages of epithet and rhythm rightly his Briefly here as elsewhere the Unbeschreibliche does not get itself gethan  The present volume is absolutely without notes except for a few pages devoted curiously to the translation of Latin phrases However in conjunction with another book of the right sort it might serve a useful lexicographical purpose Alongside of some good Italian text that has a liberal provision of notes both grammatical and historical old Bianchi s let us say it would become a real help as a pony or even as a dictionary for the American student who has taken up Dante a little before being prepared for him  A handsome volume inside and out H B F   ANNOUNCEMENT OF AWARDS  Each year our November number bears a special and difficult responsibility the awarding of prizes This year the editors and advisory committee of POETRY are enabled through the generosity of three lovers of the art all of Chicago to award three prizes for poems printed in the magazine during its fourth year October 1915 to September 1916 The first prize is restricted to a citizen of the United States the other two of which one is for a lyric make no distinction of nationality  From this competition poems by members of the editorial staff are withdrawn the members represented this year being Alice Corbin Henderson Henry B Fuller and Ezra Pound Poems by Mr Yeats are not eligible because of his very gracious declination of our Guarantors Prize the first year Messrs Sandburg and Lindsay who received the Levinson Prize in 1914 and 1915 are not eligible again for that award And translations are not considered  The HELEN HAIRE LEVINSON PRIZE of two hundred dollars offered by Mr Salmon O Levinson of Chicago for a poem or group of poems by a citizen of the United States is awarded to  MR EDGAR LEE MASTERS  of Chicago for his poem All Life in a Life published in the March number One member of the jury while concurring in the award to Mr Masters votes for the poem Arabel in the November number   Announcement of Awards  The prize of one hundred dollars offered by a guarantor for a poem or group of poems is awarded to  MR JOHN GOULD FLETCHER  for his Arizona Poems published in the March number Mr Fletcher is a cosmopolite whose residence is difficult to state As a child he lived in Little Rock Arkansas he studied at Harvard but left before graduation to travel abroad and since the war began he has lived chiefly in Boston At present he is sojourning in London where he recently married a young English lady  The last of our three prizes has given the jury the most trouble of all their first votes scattering through five or six of the year s twelve numbers In this emergency the members fell back upon the simplest definition of a lyric and remembered the prize donor s stipulation that in case of doubt the prize should be awarded to a poet comparatively young and unknown Therefore  The prize of one hundred dollars offered by Mrs Julius Rosenwald of Chicago for a lyric poem is awarded to  MISS MUNA LEE  of Oklahoma City Oklahoma for one or more poems of the group Foot notes published in the January number The jury is divided as to the particular poem to be honored numbers III IV and VII being favored  Miss Lee was graduated in 1913 from the University of Mississippi and on removing to the newer state she took   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  a post graduate course at the University of Oklahoma She made her first public appearance as a poet with Foot notes  Certain poems published this year by
