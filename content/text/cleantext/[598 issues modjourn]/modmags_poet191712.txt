expired Sept 30th 1917 and although the endowment has been partly resub scribed for another period this Fund is insufficient and expenses are constantly increasing The art of poetry requires if it is to advance not only special sympathy from a discriminating public but also endowment similar to that readily granted to the other arts All who believe in the general purpose and policy of this

indistinguishable when the curtain rises  The room represented is semi circular In the center  at the back is a large round window covered by long cur  tains There is a door at the right and one at the left  Farther forward on the stage there are two long low  wooden tables one at the right and one at the left The  walls and the curtains over the window are of a dark reddish  purple with a dim pattern of antique gold  Carlos is an eccentric pedant of about forty He is dressed  in black He wears close fitting breeches and a close fitting  tightly buttoned short coat with long tails His hair is  rumpled He leaps upon the stage through the door at the  right Nothing is visible through the door He has a long  thin white lighted taper which he holds high above his  head as he moves fantastically over the stage examining  the room in which he finds himself   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  When he has completed examining the room he tip toes to the table at the right and lights a single candle at the edge of the table nearest the front of the stage It is a thin black candle not less than two feet high All the other candles are like it They give very little light  He speaks in a lively manner but is over nice in sounding  his words As the candleNothing else is beginsvisible to on burn the he steps back regarding table it Carlos  How the solitude of this candle penetrates me I light a candle in the darkness It fills the darkness with solitude which becomes my own I become a part of the solitude of the candle of the darkness flowing over the house and into it This room and the profound room outside Just to go through a door and the change the becoming a part instantly of that profounder room and equally to feel it communicating with the same persistency its own mood its own influence and there too to feel the lesser influences of the shapes of things of exhalations sounds to feel the mood of the candle vanishing and the mood of the special night coming to take its place   He sighs After a pause he pirouettes and then continues  I was always affected by the grand style And yet I have been thinking neither of mountains nor of morgues   Wallace Stevens  To think of this light and of myself it is a duty Is it because it makes me think of myself in other places in such a light or of other people in other places in such a light How true that is other people in other places in such a light If I looked in at that window and saw a single candle burning in an empty room but if I saw a figure If now I felt that there was someone outside The vague influence the influence that clutches But it is not only here and now It is in the morning the difference between a small window and a large window a blue window and a green window It is in the afternoon and in the evening in effects so drifting that I know myself to be incalculable since the causes of what I am are incalculable   He springs toward the table flourishing his taper At the end farthest from the front of the stage he discovers a second candle which he lights He goes back to his former position  The solitude dissolves The light of two candles has a meaning different from the light of one and an effect different from the effect of one And the proof that that is so is that I feel the difference The associations have drifted a little and changed and I have followed in this change If I see myself in other places in such a light it is not as I saw myself before If I see other people in other places in such a light the people and places are differ  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ent from the people and places I saw before The solitude is gone It is as if a company of two or three people had just separated or as if they were about to gather These candles are too far apart  He flourishes his taper above the table and finds a third candle in the center of it which he lights  And yet with only two candles it would have been a cold and respectable company for the feeling of coldness and respectability persists in the presence of three modified a little as if a kind of stateliness had modified into a kind of elegance How far away from the isolation of the single candle as arrogant of the vacancy around it as three are arrogant of association It is no longer as if a company had just separated It is only as if it were about to gather as if one were soon to forget the room because of the people in the room people tempered by the lights around them affected by the lights around them sensible that one more candle would turn this formative elegance into formative luxury  He lights a fourth candle He indulges his humor  And the suggestion of luxury into the suggestion of magnificence  He lights a fifth candle  And the beginning of magnificence into the beginning of splendor  Wallace Stevens  He lights a sixth candle He sighs deeply  In how short a time have I been solitary then respectable in a company so cold as to be stately then elegant then conscious of luxury even magnificence and now I come gradually to the beginning of splendor Truly I am a modern  He dances around the room  To have changed so often and so much or to have been changed to have been carried by the lighting of six candles through so many lives and to have been brought among so many people This grows more wonderful Six candles burn like an adventure that has been completed They are established They are a city six common candles seven   He lights another and another until he has lighted twelve saying after them in turn  Eight nine ten eleven twelve  Following this he goes on tip toe to the center of the stage where he looks at the candles Their brilliance has raised his spirits to the point of gaiety He turns from the lighted table to face the dark one at the left He holds his taper before him  Darkness again as if a night wind had come blowing but too weakly to fling the cloth of darkness  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He goes to the window draws one of the curtains a little and peers out He sees nothing  I had as lief look into night as look into the dark corner of a room Darkness expels me  He goes forward holding his taper high above him until he comes to the table at the left He finds this covered with candles like the table at the right and lights them with whimsical motions one by one When all the candles have been lighted he runs to the center of the stage holding his hands over his eyes Then he returns to the window and flings aside the curtains The light from the window falls on the tall stalks of flowers outside The flowers are like hollyhocks but they are unnaturally large of gold and silver He speaks excitedly  Where now is my solitude and the lonely figure of solitude Where now are the two stately ones that left their coldness behind them They have taken their bareness with them Their coldness has followed them Here there will be silks and fans the movement of arms rumors of Renoir coiffures hands scorn of Debussy communications of body to body There will be servants as fat as plums bearing pineapples from the Azores because of twenty four candles burning together as if their light had dispelled a phantasm falling on silks and fans the movement of arms The pulse of the crowd will beat out the shallow pulses it will fill me  Wallace Stevens  A strong gust of wind suddenly blows into the room extinguishing several of the candles on the table at the left He runs to the table at the left and looks as if startled at the extinguished candles He buries his head in his arms  That too was phantasm The night wind came into the room The fans are invisible upon the floor  In a burst of feeling he blows out all the candles that are still burning on the table at the left He crosses the stage and stands before the table at the right After a moment he goes slowly to the back of the stage and draws the curtains over the window He returns to the table at the right  What is there in the extinguishing of light It is like twelve wild birds flying in autumn  He blows out one of the candles  It is like an eleven limbed oak tree brass colored in frost Regret   He blows out another candle  It is like ten green sparks of a rocket oscillating in air The extinguishing of light how closely regret follows it  He blows out another candle  It is like the diverging angles that follow nine leaves drift  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ing in water and that compose themselves brilliantly on the polished surface  He blows out another candle  It is like eight pears in a nude tree flaming in twilight The extinguishing of light is like that The season is sorrowful The air is cold  He blows out another candle  It is like the six Pleiades and the hidden one that makes them seven  He blows out another candle  It is like the seven Pleiades and the hidden one that makes them six  He blows out another candle  The extinguishing of light is like the five purple palma tions of cinquefoil withering It is full of the incipi encies of darkness of desolation that rises as a feeling rises Imagination wills the five purple palmations of cinquefoil But in this light they have the appearance of withering To feel and in the midst of feeling to imagine   He blows out another candle  The extinguishing of light is like the four posts of a cadaver two at its head and two at its feet to wit its arms and legs  Wallace Stevens  He blows out another candle  It is like three peregrins departing  He blows out another candle  It is like heaven and earth in the eye of the disbeliever  He blows out another candle He dances around the room He returns to the single candle that remains burning  The extinguishing of light is like that old Hesper clapped upon by clouds  He stands in front of the candle so as to obscure it  The spikes of his light bristle around the edge of the bulk The spikes bristle among the clouds and behind them There is a spot where he was bright in the sky It remains fixed a little in the mind  He opens the door at the right Outside the night is as blue as water He crosses the stage and opens the door at the left Once more he flings aside the curtains He extinguishes his taper He looks out He speaks with elation  Oh ho Here is matter beyond invention  He springs through the window Curtain Wallace Stevens  POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  PINE RIVER BAY  Autumn  The mimics dance in the cities Pavlowa in New York Death dances in Europe Like a bottle without cork Life loses its contents While the mimics dance in New York Offering the glories Fabled in old stories  But the leaves dance in the forest  Gold and scarlet in the north  And the gray waves dance  And the wind stalks forth  Like torn paper lanterns  Like confetti in the north  Leaves are whirling about  A purple pallid rout  Trees burn among the pines Rose and yellow torches The summer guests are gone Nobody sweeps their porches Two or three lumbermen Among the golden torches Swing huge sledge hammers While the gray lake clambers   Dorothy Dudley  Two of them love whiskey One has loved the sea All of them have faces The wind has carved in glee The mimics dance in the cities Death across the sea Leaves dance in the north And the deer run forth  Dorothy Dudley  O DEAR BROWN LANDS  O dear brown lands out of you I blossomed I feed on your rooted and wandering fruits And when my puzzled restlessness is done You

NOTES  LAKE FRONT AT NIGHT  At the edge of a beautiful gulf of gloom and stillness The city rises Glittering with millions of spangles  Seen between the dull smoke of the trains That struggle and tug laboriously And bump empty freight cars into each other With a noise like surf collapsing  Beyond there is windy darkness One or two lights low down  Seemingly blurred by mist  And waterish stars For the wind is bringing rain  To stream down the spangled faces  And make the light terraces melt together  Growing more dim  But the engines cough and call One or two lights in the silence Watch the night shutting slowly down dark doors on the  city Behind her spangled mask She frowns a little standing more weary But still casting out on the darkness   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Her glory where winds will whirl it Through dry splinters of grass on the dunes  THE MONADNOCK  Pylon for some incomplete gateway Through which the high priests of the sun Might blow their trumpets in the morning Strong red and yellow buttress What breed of desert dwellers Left you here in the midst of the city To mock with your severity The gaudy frippery of more bright façades To smolder like a polished block Of dark Egyptian stone  LA SALLE STREET EVENING  The façades glower bleakly Each one a successive fiat  They oppose with unwearied sombreness The greenish light of the sky  They extend themselves frontally Immense stubborn cliffs of fatality  Motionless summits of denial Striving with silent ambition To crush the last glimmer out   John Gould Fletcher  People go hastily beneath them with embittered glances They do not heed the throng They do not hesitate at all Their treasuries are locked and barred behind triple brazed  armor of steel They are an army in massive alignment We are the trampled grass quivering beneath their feet  WAR ANGLES  Queen Victoria s statue Was surrounded with geraniums Red as the massive backs Of scarlet coated grenadiers  Queen Victoria s statue Today

the churned mud  Slaves in mud colored garments  The storm passes over your heads  When it is over  Whatever is left of you Will get up and make a new world  It is we who are desolate  W e older people Hearing the stale chatter On life love art the war  We are the bitter ones Who cannot smile For in our heart of hearts W e know we are dried specimens in the museum Of older things Dried specimens set under glass Soon to be peered at curiously by searching alien  eyes   John Gould Fletcher  III  Let us never forget Joy has two faces One soft and transient Broken by the lightest shadow Another one harder Time worn and wrinkled Facing its pain As if fighting to get the last drop Out of the cup  Let us never forget Sometimes to shrug our shoulders There is always this drift Always this chaos Always renewal Let us remember That over this chaos There is sometimes moonlight And sometimes dawn  John Gould Fletcher  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COMMENT  CHRISTMAS AND WAR  H E Christmas of this year of grace will be the first of fifty three to find the United States at war Since the mournful Christmas of 1864 the last of Lincoln s first administration the last he was to pass on earth Santa Claus has had clean white sledding for his pack of toys No I have not forgotten the Spanish American flurry of war it began in April and was over the tenth of December peace was the nation s gift from the cheery saint with Porto Rico and the Philippines for its stocking  Now the gift we long for is victory with the kaiser s crown for a bauble of price the kaiser s crown to be tossed over the fence by the German people and set in a museum by the republics If the world can not longer exist half slave and half free how long must we labor and fight to free ourselves and the world to free ourselves that we may be worthy and able to free the world  The arts must do what they can not through preaching and propaganda that is not their function but through that freeing of the mind and lifting of the spirit which the perception of beauty brings Thus do they spur men on to clear thought and keen action to high and gallant endeavor and the records they keep the tale of the tribe they tell may become an immortal possession of glory Through beauty alone can men be inspired the beauty of a command an idea a dream Through the beauty of   Christmas and War  art alone can their deeds resist time s slander they must be forgotten unless art records them in stone or bronze in color or in the beaten gold of words  The whole world is moved as never before to unities and enmities War is now no isolated quarrel all nations are aflame Will the artists feel the universal emotion so that a spirit of fire will leap from mind to mind and kindle the new era Faith moves mountains still will they believe in the new era believe in their world And will their world believe in them will it catch their flame as it flies  Art must be powerful indeed must be generous and devoted indeed to match the prodigious energies now aroused In the Scientific American for October 27th I read the epic of the motor truck which is to carry food and ammunition to our soldiers in France Rival inventors meeting in Washington pooled their secrets competing manufacturers pooled their plants for all rivalries were forgotten all competitions obliterated in the common purpose to make the best possible machine for the nation s need The new motor for airplanes represents a similar union of energies a similar devotion of individual genius to a common cause the greatest experts in this inventive nation men formerly rivals locking themselves together through days and nights for the solution of a difficult problem  Here we find men of science and business men representing the keenest commercialism of a so called materialistic age and country all forgetting their battles and jealousies   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  forgetting profits omitting from their plans both the ego and the dollar thinking only of the best possible combination of brains for the best possible product uniting their powers for a result more powerful than any individual could possibly have attained  In the past the united arts have achieved results as wonderful the Parthenon the mediaeval cathedrals the carved and painted churches of Italy the Maya monuments of Yucatan all represent an obliteration of rivalries a union of individual energies for the triumph of a common purpose In these cases religion was the motive or a combination of religion and patriotism the motive becoming transfigured in the tribal mind to an ideal which only beauty could fitly serve In the case of the truck and the motor we find if not religion a fundamental sense of brotherhood of democratic tribal unit expressing itself if not in beauty in something scarcely less noble the fittest possible instrument of service  When the motives of artists become once more united and spiritualized by a common emotion beyond individual profit or glory we shall have great art to vie with the art of the past We shall have it because individual power the power of genius will be reinforced incalculably multiplied by the reactions of sympathy because the men of vision magically stimulating each other will create beauty beyond the dreams of any one of them We shall have it because of the common will to eliminate waste the waste of futile effort despair thwarted desire suicidal agonies of body and   Christmas and War  soul which strews the paths of art with human wreckage W e shall have it because of a mystic force in the human will a force compelling even in the individual unit a force multiplied beyond mere numbers in the group and overwhelmingly irresistible when the tribal will is aroused  It is something like this that the Christmas of 1917 should bring to our poets and other artists as they watch our young men going to war or march along in the ranks These boys in khaki with complete simplicity and abandon are giving themselves to a cause by their union by their courage and joy in it they will make the cause irresistible Do the men of vision feel a loosening of veils from their eyes a falling of walls in their hearts as they see the youth of the nation giving itself away Do they see wider horizons feel deeper loves Do their spirits fuse together for heat and power in the great fire that is burning Will they give us the miracle that they alone can give the beauty of the new era that must come when war has burned away the old  H M  AGAIN THE NEGRO  A very real Negro Samson came into my mind as I read Mr Vachel Lindsay s Negro Sermon in the birthday number of POETRY for in my ears awoke the strains of an old plantation melody Gawd s a gwine t move all de troubles away whose verses tell of Samson with all the artless familiarity of the true folk singer And then Mr Lindsay s use of the phrase My Lord is riding high vividly   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  recalled to me the triumphant Negro song Ride on Jesus which probably originated in a shout as they called those exuberant melodies composed in the ecstasy of camp meet n and was evidently inspired by the description of the Savior s entrance into Jerusalem the hosannas the palms and Jesus riding on an ass  Both these plantations as the Negroes call the old slave songs I first heard through a colored man from St Helena s Island off the coast of South Carolina where the population is almost wholly Negro and the language and music typically black Though the songs being genuine folk songs are common property I made a careful record of them words and music just as they are sung by Negroes in the South and these will be published in a collection for the benefit of Hampton Institute in Virginia Meanwhile it might perhaps interest those readers of POETRY who have been stirred by Mr Lindsay s Sermon to meet in a purely literary form these two genuine Negro folk poems As the poems were really conceived by their creators as songs and the music forms an absolutely integral part of the rhythmic values I shall italicize the accented syllables as sung so as to reproduce the typical Negro syncopation of the melody which to the song maker s mind was one with the verse Not however that every Negro in singing would stress the song in exactly the same way for the freedom of complete individualism is the inalienable right of every Negro bard Here is the first song  Gawd s a gwine t move all de troubles away Gawd s a gwine t move all de troubles away   Again the Negro  Fer Gawd s a gwine t move all de troubles away See m no more till de com in day Now follow lines about Methusaleh and Nicodemus and then the swiftly graphic verses devoted to Samson All who are familiar with Negro folk songs understand how subtly and delightfully the vowel a pronounced ah of course tacked on in front of a word or at the end of it gives a needed stroke of emphasis furnishes an introductory grace note or softens and binds in that fluency demanded by the Negro ear the sterner syllables of the English tongue The graceful little word twill is a Negro beautification of our prosaic sounding till  A read about Sam son From his birth  De stronges man ev er walked on earth A read way back In de an cient time  He slew ten thou sand Phil is tine  A Samson he went A walkin a bout  A Sam son s strength a was never found out Twill his wife set down Upon his knee  An a tell me whar yo strength a lies ef you please A Samson s wife She done talk so fair  A Samson tol her Cut off a ma hair If yo shave ma hade Jes as clean as yo han  Ma strength a will become a like a natch erl man For Gawd s a gwine t move all de troubles away etc  The effusion of Samson s confession to his wife is thoroughly Negro in its enthusiasm Not content with telling   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  her merely that his strength lies in his hair he rapidly goes on to bid her shave his head And as of course the tight curling Negro hair can hardly be much cut without shaving we can readily see that to the singer s mind Samson is indeed as Mr Lindsay states a Jack Johnson a full blooded black Strong Man  The other song Ride on Jesus is superb in the royal dignity and victory of its melody  O Ride on Jesus Ride on Jesus Ride on conquerin King Want t go t hebb n in de mo nin  Ef yo see ma Mud der Shouted by the solo singer Oh yes Shouted by the chorus  Jes a tell her Fo me Oh yes  Fo t meet me tomorrow in Gali lee Want t go t hebb n in de mo n in  Then come endless verses appointing a like meeting to father brother sister deacon preacher et cetera And next these glorious lines shouting a glad certainty of salvation the services of John the Baptist being now unnecessary  Ef yo see John D Baptist Oh yes  Jes a tell him Fo me Oh yes  Dat I s bin to de ribber an I s bin baptize Want t go t hebb n in de mo n in  And at the last follows the sudden flash of imagery that   Again the Negro  so often proclaims the ingenuous Negro folk singer a true poet  Ef yo wanter go t hebb n Oh yes I ll a tell yo how Oh yes  Jes keep yo han s on de Gospel plow Want t go t hebb n in de mo n in  Natalie Curtis  REVIEWS  MISS LOWELL ON TENDENCIES  Tendencies in Modern American Poetry by Amy Lowell  Macmillan Co  It is a relief to have at last an absorbing book on the new movement in American poetry a book by one who is in the movement and who is up to date in her point of view Whether one agrees with Miss Lowell s opinions or not no one can question her knowledge of the subject and of the literature in English French and perhaps other languages which forms the historic and immediate background of the subject She is trained she is competent and being herself a poet of high repute in the movement she is sympathetic with its manifestations Indeed her attitude is one of enthusiasm and confidence sighs for the past and apologies for the present are now definitely relegated to the limbo of old fashions  But competent and informed as Miss Lowell is she has given us rather the book of a theorist than of a student   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  open minded and open eyed Theories are dangerous in either art or life The man of science accumulates thousands of facts before he ventures on a theory and unless his theory stands the test of every fact then or thereafter presented it goes upon the scrap heap In the fluidities of art and life however this scientific precision is difficult The facts lack definite outline each observer sees them differently Conclusions thus tend to become merely the expression of an individual temperament or preference and they are valuable according to the breadth and universality of the critic s intellectual horizon  Miss Lowell has tried to formulate and systematize a wide and rather disorderly literary democracy by a running comment on the lives and works of six poets who in her opinion concentrate and express its movement Others she seems to say in her introduction may be interesting even admirable but they are less typical being either on the edge of the main current or outside of it in little pools or eddies of their own  The book states the author s case but makes no effort to prove it It is the opening argument of a law suit with the examination of six witnesses and the presentation of facts the narrative part of her case But nowhere does she gather her facts together round up and discuss all possible cross examinations and opposing arguments and complete her case with a convincing appeal One feels that here is an author of firm conviction strong will and intense imaginative enthusiasm who thinks that American   Miss Lowell on Tendencies  poetry either does or ought to follow a certain marked off path and that any American poetry which does not conform is thereby outside the movement  There is a curious familiarity in this attitude of mind Miss Lowell is caught unaware by her Puritan inheritance we have once more orthodoxy and heresy once more a laying down of the law But the trouble is the law won t stay laid  What for example can be done with Vachel Lindsay Miss Lowell tries to dispose of him in a sentence of the introduction as rather popularizing the second stage of the movement the stage of Masters and Sandburg than heading a completely new tendency of his own But although no tendency whatever is completely new Mr Lindsay is no corollary of his Chicago confreres and any discussion of American poetry which leaves him out is in danger of being discarded by the next age If the thesis is not big enough to account for him then the thesis has to be scrapped Mr Lindsay represents a tendency much richer and more indigenous than that personified by the imagists for example however fine and high theirs may be His roots run deep into the past of American literature Mark Twain and Riley and Brer Rabbit Harris were his collateral relatives and all the wild lore that is in our western blood our love of the wilderness the folk sense of magic in nature and life the instinct of sympathy with all kinds and races of men all this is in Vachel Lindsay s tendency and he carries a good share of the new movement   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  on his shoulders And more or less in the same group with him march poets like Benét Miss Wyatt Dr Gordon Miss Skinner and a troop of youngsters each of whom is inspired by some particular local or racial group of our myriad minded country  W e will pass by the conservatives the poets who conform on the whole to the elder tendencies although any complete study of our subject would have to discuss and estimate values in the work of men and women like Arthur Ficke Agnes Lee Witter Bynner Sara Teasdale and others  But in presenting the claim of the radicals Miss Lowell can not justly confine it to four poets Her study of these four is on the whole sympathetic though I should question many details Mr Masters work for example springs out of a social experience unusually rich varied and profound He knows whereof he speaks and no one who knows no lawyer doctor man or woman of affairs who has plunged to the deeps of modern society and who does not gloss over what he sees could call Spoon River brutal or say that its author sees life through the medium of sex And to us who long ago noted the flaming idealism of this poet it seems strange indeed to find Miss Lowell including him among the professed realists who are apt to forget that idealism a perception of beauty an aspiration after fineness and nobleness are also real In the study of Carl Sandburg there is less to criticize in fact this section and the one on Robert Frost are in my opinion the best of the book for I find Robinson somewhat overstressed   Miss Lowell on Tendencies  The final chapter the one on the imagists with H D and John Gould Fletcher as American exemplars we must again criticize as incomplete considered as a study of present day radical symbolism to speak broadly in this country If Miss Lowell were not the author we might begin by objecting to the omission of her own name If the imagists fairly represented the whole story we might further specify Ezra Pound whose work whether always strictly bounded by the tenets of imagism or not has been immensely fecund as Carl Sandburg pointed out long ago in POETRY and certainly represents a tendency  But the imagists are by no means the whole story The delicate and whimsical art of Wallace Stevens for example art too individual to be listed under any school is yet extremely significant The spiritual vision of Cloyd Head also represents more than a passing or personal phase Nor can anyone safely omit the fascinating experiments in moods and rhythms of Alfred Kreymborg T S Eliot William Carlos Williams Helen Hoyt and others All these demand consideration as representing a tendency of which the imagists are only one element  The truth is that American poetry today is a rather large democracy Mr Stuart Walker director of the adventurous Portmanteau Theatre gives a lecture entitled Every Little Theatre has a Movement all its Own So in the poetic movement also it is unsafe to select special groups and set metes and bounds for every American poet has a movement all his own One may recognize that a widespread   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  renaissance is certainly in process one may study its multiform manifestations but whither it is leading us and who will emerge as the leaders it is much too early to say  Meantime we may welcome Miss Lowell s book as important in the discussion No one can fail to be thrilled by the six portraits it exhibits records of singularly typical American lives Robinson isolate contemplative sternly observant Frost the Yankee plastic and passive wandering but always drawn back to his own place Masters son of the middle border richly impassioned in life as in art Sandburg the northern offshoot powerful in growth tender in bloom under our bluer sky H D shy and sensitive pilgrim of beauty and John Gould Fletcher American by inborn passion cosmopolite by training and taste a brooding and melancholy seer of visions Could any six characters six lives be more representative than these of our far flung nation of many bloods and creeds  Miss Lowell paints these portraits in vivid colors If we think her book rather six portraits than a single complete composition if we find its title too general for its content it is at any rate a big gun for a certain point of view The danger is that the public will think it covers the whole subject will be too ready to accept it as final and authoritative And to admit this danger is to admit the author s power and repute both as poet and critic H M   A Poet of the Present  A POET OF TH E PRESENT  These Times by Louis Untermeyer Henry Holt amp Co  In The Atlantic Monthly for October Mr O W Firkins makes a plea for the closer union of poetry and life He urges the necessity for variation in the one to conform to the irregular pace of the other He deplores the constant artificial mood of exaltation which had come to be a common convention of verse before the flood of the recent poetic renaissance swept away the dikes of false sentiment and the dams of hyperbolic diction That Mr Firkins refuses to see the beginnings of just such a change in the new poetry is merely to state that Mr Firkins is a conservative and an academe The Biblical camel confronted with the eye of the needle is no more at a loss than are the English Departments of our colleges placed face to face with the work of living men After all why should we quarrel with such an attitude It is the business of a college to teach the past it is the business of the collegians to create the future But that the conservatives admit that a change was needed is more than encouraging it is extraordinary Let us be glad my brothers that we are not yet dead and mummified into prescribed reading Let us be glad that we are still lusty with splendid thoughts of beauty and revolt and that nobody has yet cursed us for keeping him from a football game  Still Mr Firkins is right in demanding a brisker more robust expression for contemporary American life These times are not the England of the mid nineteenth century   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  These times are largely what Louis Untermeyer says they are in his book which bears this exceedingly happy title  In Challenge Mr Untermeyer was the youth flashing against this and that fact of daily life parrying thrusting rollicking and following a banner partially obscured in clouds of chimney smoke His reactions were fine and adolescent he shouted old songs and infused into them his own fresh irresponsible meaning Challenge was a book of promise but not a book of achievement  The important thing about These Times is that the poet has not abandoned his wondering delight at life There is knowledge but no disillusion There is less kicking up of heels in a patch of sunlight but the satisfaction with the sun remains The whole has taken on a wider sweep Mr Untermeyer sees things in a less isolated manner more in the whole as it were There is the same tilting at abuses but the tilting is aimed not at the outgrowth as before but at the roots There is less sentimentality and more sentiment Altogether the book has a greater seriousness than Challenge and is consequently more emotional and compelling  In my book Tendencies in Modern American Poetry I have endeavored to show that the present poetical revolt has three distinct phases That its beginning is a vague unrest perhaps only partially understood even by the men who labor under it that the second phase is conscious revolution a desire for change and reform a change and reform largely taking shape in concrete suggestions action wins over con   A Poet of the Present  templation and violence for the time drowns out the lyric impulse The third phase is that of accomplished evolution even though the evolution be but at the very beginning of its term The result is leisure and a cessation of internal conflict leaving the mind of the poet free once more to receive the impressions of external beauty  I refer to this idea here merely to place Mr Untermeyer in his niche in the present movement in which he is a potent factor He belongs to the second of these phases the revolutionary one but unlike so many of the men who compose this second phase he has reached it through sympathy rather than through conflict He has had no cramping Puritanic ideals to combat he has not been forced to fight his surroundings but has been blown along with them For this reason we see in him a different trend from that of Mr Masters for instance or Mr Sandburg Mr Masters is steeped in bitterness Mr Sandburg is only partially freed from the matrix of dumbness which bound his ancestors He is like a sculptured figure escaping from its granite mesh here an arm is free there a foot but at a little distance there is just a huge ungainly block of marble Mr Untermeyer is no wholesome unpalatable draught he is no granite pillar shapeless but full of potentialities Rather is he like a song of Schumann drifting down an empty street a sudden hymn sung by soldiers after a victory For Mr Untermeyer sings of defeat and yet every pulse of his beats victory  There is a simple answer to this difference Mr Untermeyer is a Jew and in thinking of the Jews one should   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  never forget Matthew Arnold s illuminating epigram The Jewish race has a flair for religion This flair for religion is in all that Mr Untermeyer writes We see the same thing more obviously expressed in the work of another Jewish poet James Oppenheim  It makes no difference whether Mr Untermeyer is a professing Jew or not the flair is here Much of his poetry reminds one of the ritualistic dances of the Old Testament There are pipes and timbrels in plenty but they are played with the ecstasy of dedication It is not Mr Untermeyer s sociological bias which stirred the students of Columbia and Barnard to name their little paper after his book Challenge although they may think that this was the reason it is the compelling force of religious enthusiasm which shouts from its pages And it is just this religious fire which makes These Times such an important contribution to the poetry of to day  Every man has a religion no one can live without and it is of no moment under what symbol it presents itself But those few in every generation whose religion is at once militant joyful and sustaining become leaders in thought and action  It is true that Mr Untermeyer s technique lags behind his impulse But the impulse is so sincere and masterful that it carries the poems forward on an engulfing wave No matter what the subject lyric drama satire we feel behind it the man standing bareheaded and exultant before the tables of stone In Eve Speaks and Moses on Sinai we have the most absolute examples of this attitude and it is   A Poet of the Present  a characteristic of this impassioned devotion that these poems are all intermingled with everyday thoughts and actions Eve s fall was no mere following the line of least resistance it was a conscious act to rid Adam of a life of thoughtless ease to gird him for a battle and fling him into its midst Life is a battle again and again Mr Untermeyer affirms it and the will to fight for the cause is a glorious possession Moses on Sinai again strips off symbol to reveal fact and in so doing but rears a greater symbol A Pantheist Perhaps but what is Pantheism but a symbol Mr Untermeyer admits the universe and admitting it worships beyond it the unknowable  This is a modern attitude Science is no more the negative of religion but its ally Science takes us step by step to truth that it has not yet reached the final truth is nothing Dare we say it will And if it does Is a great man less great because we know him Will truth be less appalling when it is entirely revealed Mr Untermeyer sees life starkly and honestly and still worships So should we all if we could free ourselves of shibboleths In The Dead Horse the poet shows us a fact disagreeable to the eye of convention of an awe inspiring magnificence to the eye of science of a supreme beauty to the eye of religion For The Dead Horse is a parable of the perpetual resurrection of life  Lovers shows this same fearless facing of facts Love is not enough it is never enough To Mr Untermeyer love is the healer and fortifier but the battle must be faced Love gives power and the fight is resumed   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  It is this belief in life which makes real war seem so hideous The Battle Cries section is all a protest against the waste of war The very militance and courage which goes willingly into the war for ideas holds aloof from a carnage in which the idea is for the moment lost sight of This is from no lack of personal courage but from the conviction that thought is more potent than fact which it is but all men are not thinkers and to such facts alone speak Also Mr Untermeyer s sociological bias urges him to conserve men and he loses sight of the fact that it is not any men which it is important to conserve but such men as can advance the race War is an ordeal by fire out of which must come purification  I think The Laughers is the finest poem in the book The progression from the light happy laughter of Spring to the hideous realities of war to the laughter of ghouls who find men so little advanced that they need such an ordeal is really tremendous This is one of the strongest poems which the present war has produced  The Victory of the Beet fields is another war poem the power of which is not to be denied and in it is a lyric note which is one of Mr Untermeyer s most characteristic qualities For the poet is not merely a strong and virile thinker he is an artist and a singer as well although I think his lyricism is more effective where he uses it to point his serious pieces than when it is the main purport of the poem In his more obvious lyrics there is a too reminiscent quality a tendency to employ the stamped and usual which seriously   A Poet of the Present  injures them the are not sufficiently pointed not sharp enough For instance in Bacchanal death is a giddy precipice life a brimming goblet and the poet even permits himself to quaff the fiery Spring It is such expressions as these which cause that lagging of technique which I have mentioned And this is strange as in and Other Poets Mr Untermeyer showed a rare mastery over words and manners The truth would seem to be that his taste leans ever so slightly to the Teutonic vice of sentimentality that schwarmerei from which Heine saved himself by a fine irony Not that Mr Untermeyer is devoid of irony It is the chief ingredient of many of his Thirteen Portraits but it deserts him in his songs and is not even present in the slight form of a corrective It is when the articulate bones of a strong serious subject decline to be obscured that we see Mr Untermeyer producing a poem at once lyric and firm Immortal illustrates what I mean and might be placed as a motto before all Mr Untermeyer s work  I wish I had space to comment on those excellent poems Swimmers On the Palisades Still Life a beautiful little genre piece and Victories Mr Untermeyer s love of nature is no whit behind his love of humanity and he possesses to a marked extent that sine qua non of the true poet the seeing of romance in the full expression of life in its sordid elements no less than in its most exalted The Portrait of a Jewelry Drummer is a splendid rebuke to the blind and its light satiric touch but heightens the sense of beauty and awe   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  From squalid realism on the one hand from nebulous aestheticism on the other These Times is happily free and if Mr Untermeyer pursues the path he has so fearlessly chosen we need not doubt that his next book will be a still further advance Amy Lowell  SONG AND PROPAGANDA  Roads and What is Your Legion By Grace Fallow Norton Houghton Mifflin Co Among the poems in the first of these volumes one comes  on strange and fragrant verse like this  If my mother knew How our doves at dawn Shake me with their wings Wild bewildered wan When the white star sings And they would be gone  One poem especially In a Green Place makes an intriguing pattern  In a green place A vine twined green place Where I wished to lie sweetly dreaming and sleeping Where I wished to wake laughing and leaping In a green place A tree guarded green place I saw a little girl in a black dress weeping  A number of other poems too one must credit with a richness of sound alluring like some glamorous fabric on a  bargain counter To read the whole volume however is  to be surfeited with windiness of thought phrase and  rhythm with a kind of gladness coarsely sentimental in   Song and Propaganda  texture It seems a pity that more writers have not the instinct to publish only the piquant fragments of their work their art then might at least appear to be more complete  What Is Your Legion is propaganda rather than poetry written before this country had entered the war to rouse America from its indifference It rings with sentiments usually called fine or noble the way a busy street car rings with its fares It testifies I think to the elusiveness of the arts to the futility of trying to mobilize them or volunteer their service for any unintrinsic purpose  In this to veer slightly from Miss Norton in whose work at least shines the zeal of the volunteer there is a moral for societies like the Vigilantes who would offer their goddess to war as a kind of advertising girl Very swiftly she evades them and leaves them to perpetrate atrocities alone paintings that shriek through an acre of brazen paint and impotent line for men to go to war and poems too often empty and blatant  Work like this they should leave frankly to the commercial craftsman realizing that no fine art will ever result because some artist has come across or been drafted in that the great poem for example will speak of war only because the poet has wanted to having loved or hated it or caught some passionate glimpse of it and that perhaps he will not speak of it at all Abandoning the idea of a liaison between art and war such a society could then turn rather toward making possible the integrity of the artist in time of war Conservation being the fashion should it not   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  extend beyond material food if we believe that when peace comes men cannot live by bread alone   Or would this be an impractical and over provident measure the policy of the idealist Doubtless there is no wind so evil as to blow nobody good In the war ridden countries one hears already the ceremony of marriage is becoming somewhat irrelevant This perhaps is the glorious day of the prostitute in art as well as in life Admitting this possibility at least one enjoys a glimmer of the truth and its attendant freedom Dorothy Dudley CORRESPONDENCE  ABOUT EMERSON  Dear POETRY There are many who like myself have liked your editorials in POETRY and who agree with your attitude towards the artificial and stilted style of certain academic verse But your remarks on Emerson in the September number while extremely novel do not impress us as quite just to the ideas of the great sage  During a twenty years exploration of his Templa Serena I have found that before his essays were published they were trimmed and shorn made safe for New England democracy I mixed them with a little Boston water so they would sell in New York and London these are his own words And if the English Traits were re written according to Emerson s true opinion as expressed in his journals what splendid shadows would offset the present high lights    About Emerson  of that book And what of Emerson s Poet is he really a grand inaccessible figure Let the master speak for himself  The poet is least a poet when he sits crowned Journal vol 7 p 198 Out upon scholars with their pale sickly indoor thoughts Journal vol 8 p 532 and so on through ten fascinating volumes Even the cubists are anticipated He flung his mental doors and windows open to infinite possibilities when he said Think how many more eggs remain to be hatched Emerson s idea of a poet is a loving genius who scorns dignity laurels authorities and rhymes in order as he says to straddle that wild horse the people  From Concord on July 21st 1885 he wrote a memorable letter to Whitman quoted by J A Symonds in his study of Whitman What more could you wish And when we remember that even Nietzsche that supreme iconoclast bowed in reverence before Emerson long after he had turned away from Schopenhauer s funereal perfume must we not be careful before we attempt to interpret so deep a thinker  Ernest Nelson  Note by the Editor Our correspondent mentions the chief cause for criticism of Emerson that he did not stick to his colors A great sage should either speak the truth or be silent he should not mix the truth with a little Boston water to please his publishers and public  The same spirit of compromise affected his attitude toward Whitman It is true that he wrote Whitman a memorable letter praising the Leaves of Grass But afterwards when the hue and cry  was raised did he not retract did not his later remarks differ materially from this first letter    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FIFTY YEARS SINCE BAUDELAIRE  The American correspondent of the Mercure de France writes us apropos of the recent semi centennial of the death of Charles Baudelaire  Perhaps it is not too late to send you two or three items concerning this literary event which has attracted wide attention in France  Òf the several new editions of Les Fleurs du Mal which have appeared in Paris during the past year that issued by M Robert Helleu the well known art printer and publisher seems to me the most attractive in every respect It contains a short introduction by M André Gide one of the best Baudelaire authorities in France and includes three striking portraits of the poet one of which was drawn by Baudelaire himself  M Helleu says In the midst of our more serious troubles the semi centennial of the death of Baudelaire is an event which has stirred up considerable heated discussion Never have the significance and the influence of this poet been so preponderant as today Like all true artists Baudelaire is loved warmly or not understood a middle course which some are trying to follow is difficult to hold In the presence of such a perfect work of art as Les Fleurs du Mal which has been before the public for over a half century one must admire it or condemn it Two opposing systems of aesthetics stand face to face and those who have labored not to make a choice between them have made a choice in spite of themselves Even the journalistic polemics which this anniversary have given rise to show in themselves how alive today is the aristocratic figure of this admirable singer   On September 30th the Souvenir Littéraire a Paris association of men of letters whose raison d être is the celebration of literary events commemorated Baudelaire The poet M Robert Lestrange who was one of the organizers of the ceremony writes me in this connection As it is impossible to fête the author of Les Fleurs du Mal without also fêting Edgar Poe whose works he translated in such a masterly way the occasion united in the same tribute of admiration the two great writers Tlieodore Stanton  Notes  NOTES  Mr Wallace Stevens a New York lawyer now living in Hartford Conn is well known to our
