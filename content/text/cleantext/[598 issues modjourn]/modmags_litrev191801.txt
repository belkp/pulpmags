Raoul Root A MERIC A hasat last produceda criticor rather a native American critic has at last succeeded in extricating his mind from his surroundings to such a degree as to be able to envisage the said surroundingsThis does not mean that we have coughed up a new aesthete who will remurmurin rather more veiled and semidiaphanous tonesthe same velleities which Arthur Symons uttered in 1891HLMencken has read his Mark TwainIt is a great blessing that at last some one with fibre tough enough to read Mark Twainand intelligence enough to perceive the part which is not simpleHee Haw has at last diagnosed Mark Twain s troublePages 203 5 of MrMencken s book show him to be a critic of no mean profundityIn these pages MrMenckenor DrKellner to whom he refershas given a correct diagnosisHe has put his finger on the plague spot My own detestation of Twain has stayed vague for a number of yearsthere were too many more important things to attend toI could not be bothered to clarify this patch of vaguenessA detestation of a man s tonality does not necessitate a blindness to his abilitiesAnd when a man s rightnesses have been so lied against as Twain s were in Americaone could be well content to conceal a private and unimportant detestationOne could not express a dislike of any manfor instancewhose posthumous publications have been so lied about and distorted as Twain s final pessimistic expressionsMencken is in some circles considered a purely frivolous person because he editsof half editsa frivolous magazineIn a half baked country one has to use what tools one can lay hold ofI would call one fact to the attention of the cognoscentinamelythat The Smart Set is the only magazine in America that has ever reduced a circulation from 70 000 to 20 000 in a quixotic attempt to break through the parrochial taboo and give America free literatue A Book of Prefacesby HLMenckenAlfred AKnopfNew YorkI have it on personal knowledge that Willard Huntington Wright went to London about five years ago determined to buy up the best stuff he could findI do not in the least mean to imply that MrWright and I would see eye to eye in questions of excellenceI may reserve my opinion that literature is not a commoditythat literature emphatically does not lie on a counter where it can be snatched up at once by a straw hatted young man in a hurryAn editor pleased withOzymandias or with the fifth act ofThe Cenci might have rushed up to Shelleyfor exampleand found nothing in that worthy s desk butThe Sensitive Plant than which no poet of any reputation ever penned anything less desirable Moreoverthe better the author the greater his detestation of magazines and the less likely he is to believe inor take the slightest interest in the success ofany magazine for which he has not some very personal security in his own private knowledge of the editors and the business managementLet us remember that David Phillips had been shot by a fanaticthat various living writers were under contract elsewhereand that The Smart Set did publish some of the first stories of James Joyce and some of the first short stories of DHLawrenceAlso that Wright resigned reasonably soon after he found that he was not free in his selectionThese huge mechanisms have to be kept goingif they are to remain huge mechanismsin that condition they can be of very littleservice to literature until there iswhat is almost unthinkableareally largepublic intensely interested in literatureThe point I wish to emphasizein part replying to the people who object to being asked the pertinent question regarding Whistler and Henry James and their protracted foreign residenceis that New York has a critic dealing with native affairsGraham Phillips dealt with native affairsin a style as crude as the types he depictedHe was painful to readbut he was working in honestyand he was shot by a fanaticnot a New Englander I don t know that he had been taken very seriouslyDreiser is taken seriously because the violent opposition to him has been longerit has not been settled at the point of a pistolIn all this the American hatred of libertytheir peculiar loathing of all forms of intellectual freedomis striking and apparentThe last study in Mencken s book is full of fruitful suggestionone animadverts to Franklin and Jefferson and remembers how carefully they are screened in school historieshow few Americans looking back upon the glory of America s founder have the slightest notion The Little Review of Franklin s ideas upon Godor of Jefferson s ideas upon dalliance Still they are represented in the standard school histories as men of great brilliance and acumen Washington s intelligence isI believeleft unmentionedas are his personal law suits regarding certain acerageOn page 218 MrMencken falls heavilytreats WDHowells and Henry James togetherand shows a total inability to get any further with Henry James than the mentioning of a limitation which Henry James had himself better definedI venture to suggestvery simplythat MrMencken has read very little of the authorand that he is so intent on his main themewherein he is right in the mainthat he has rather warped his idea of James to his own particular purpose and treated one superficial aspect rather than James in totoIf this error is not an oversight on MrMencken s partit allies him to the philistines he inveighs againstand shows him bit by the very baccilus that he is out to exterminateadding perhaps by this very misfortune to the cogency of his warningWith the excision of this one excessive pagethe essay can be recommended as a necessary text book in all high schoolswherein there is now current too little plain written historyWe should be grateful to MrMencken for the actual names of thedozen men page 294His history at this point is important enough to be worth a little documentationMencken in this part of his bookat leastis guarded and careful in his statementsWhether he can preserve this gravity of tone sufficiently to be really effectivewhether he is indeed what his adversaries would callthe chosen instrument of the Lord s vengeance upon them I do not knowbut his book is at least enough to convince one that whatever America s part in world warand whatever its results to hershe is faced at home with a no less serious war for internal freedomand for the arteries and capillaries of freedomthe mail routes and pressesIt is a sinister and significant fact that even a campaign for the freedom of art becomes in American acampaign a sort of super religious crusadeso does the actual genius of the countrythe actual volk geistenforce its forms upon contemporary expression As ever in prosecompare for example the wholly mediaeval and limited Dante of the prose worksmodeled by and comforming with his timewith the lasting Dante who flashes out of the emotional passages in poetry passages which form only a part of his terza rima The Little Review 13 MrMenckenPhilistine To a person who has not had the advantage of American ancestry and American traditionsit is at first a little confoundingbut later it becomes quite right and logicalthat MrMencken should be the critic of just the men and things he has chosen to criticizeHis treatment of Henry James does not seem to me an error but rather the stamp of the true democratic inability to distinguishbreedsof thingsHere he is writing in the best manner of the men he criticizesMrMencken s Truisms Margaret Anderson In the real senseI believeMrMencken cannot be considered as critic at allA critic does not believe that because an author s work is free of attempts to edifyto consoleto improveor to moralizethe author is free of the chief lacks which stand in the way of artMr Mencken believes thisread the generalizations in his chapter on Conradread his estimate of DreiserA critic is not conscious that art has ever got mixed up with such mattersor that the absence of such matters would in any way help art to creep inBut MrMencken calls Winston Churchill s Richard Carvel within its limitsa work of art and The Inside of the Cupbecause it is an outpouring of social and economic panaceas no more than a compendium of paralogyas silly and smattering as a speech by William Jennings Bryan or a shocker by Jane Addams Of course the first has no more art than the secondIt is a charming and dashing story But how did it come to be dragged into a modern discussion of aestheticsNexta critic is not interested in the old discussions as to whetherdeft craftmanshipmakes an artistBut MrMencken talks always with a residue of these old and very unessential distinctions in the back of his mindSo when he comes to Kipling he grants him the craftmanshipetc but says he is not an artist in the sense that Conrad is because his ideas are those of a mob oratorwhile Conrad s ideas plough down into the sub strata of human motive and actAll this explains the difference in the minds of the two menIt does not touch upon the difference in what they have madeA critic does not talk ofbeauty per seand of pure artists He makes no distinctions between art and pure artfor the reason that there are noneA critic is concernedfirstlastand alwayswith art emotionsHuman emotions interest himbut he does not confuse the twoMrMencken does almost nothing elseHis valutions are nearly all those of theradical that isof the man who takes more naturally to ideas than to qualityThis explains his feeling about Chopinalso his remark about Lizst splebian warts which were no more plebian than his finely cut noseand his description of Poe scongenital vulgarity and shoddy soul These things hurt you as fiercely as all the other talk you hear from people who are congenitally unaware of qualityA critic could no more summarize Dreiser s limitationsas MrMencken very ably doesand then call Dresier an artist than he could call an airship that didn t fly a successful airshipTo prove that Dreiser gets his effects not by designing them but by living themetc etc and then that hemanagesto produce works of art of unquestionable beauty and authorityis amusingTo say that he is still in the transition stage between Christian Endeavor and civilizationthat his steps are made uncertain by a guiding theory which too often eludes his own comprehensionto show him in fact as an ungrownun selfconsciousmuddledevangelicalnaive man witha solemnly absurd respect for Bouguereau etc etc and then to say that he can interpret life in a way that is poignant and illuminatingis patheticJust as pathetic as the naive explanation of why Schubert was an artist though he was an ignoramus even in music which is merely talking like the college professors whom MrMencken scornsEven they have long been silent before the phenomenon that a man may be ignorant and still be a creatorWhat business has a modern critic to be interested in such truismsMr Mencken s book should be read because of its chapter on American puritanismAside from that there are other things in it which may be useful for America as a statement of facts up to a point But as a piece of aesthetic criticism it will have no interest any where elseThere is not an ounce of original discrimination in itTHE CONVALESCENT IN THE SOUTH Jessie Dismorr Out of the evil tangle of waters a faggot is tossed on to a couch of foamI am bedded in the silken winter of the southstorm and fever have ebbed

MEN Ford Madox Hueffer IHonour THE OTHER DAY an author of some position came to me in a state of great angerHe had been asked by a woman writer to compose a preface for her volume of short stories that was newly to appearMy friend H had written the prefaceHe had dilated on the fact that publishers said the short story in volume form did not sellHe had gone on to say that probably the publishers were rightBut that was because short stories in England are simply not good enoughand he adduced the fact that when short stories were really first rate they sold in quantities really enormousHe instanced Messrs ABand Call authors of short stories with huge publicsthen he went on to talk of the stories by the lady herselfHe told me that he had made a good job of it and I dare say he hadThe epilogue came when the publishers of the volume flatly refused to print the prefaceThey said that no honourable publisher would publish a word against any other publisher and they flatly refused to print in a volume published by them any flattering reference to any author not published by themThe authors A B and C whom my friend H had mentioned with admiration were all publishedthat is to say by other firmsMy friend H was exceedingly infuriatedHe said that it was an outrage to ask anybody to write a preface for nothing and then to cavil at its contentsHe said that if publishers were to refuse to publish any comments on the habits of publishers they would thus be establishing a censorship which was utterly against all decencyunder the cloak of it they would be able of course to commit any outrageAndif all publishers were going to set up the pretention that in a book published by them no work by any author appearing through another publisher could ever be praisedthere would be an end of criticism since criticism only exists by means of comparisonAnd MrH s fury became enormous when he spoke of the authoressHe said that this was what came of having to do with womenHe said that no woman had any principles whateverThe trouble was that Miss W the woman writer in questionhad not been really excessively pleased with my friend H s prefaceShe had expected him to devote the whole of that piece of writing to her own meritsShe had wanted enormities of praiseNow my friend H happened to be a particularly intimate friend of Miss WHe said that one cannot apply butter with a trowel to the works of one s intimatesIt was not the thing to doit was not honorableit was not even politeMiss W on the other hand wanted to know what a friend was for if he could not praise one s booksMiss W put up no sort of fight against the publisherShe just let MrH s preface dropIt seemed to her that it was reasonable that publishers should refuse to allow other publishers to be commented onShe even said that that was why men got on better than womenThey stuck together and realised that dog does not eat dogAnd she was quite on the side of the publishers in their refusing to have anything to do with praising other publishersauthorsShe said that that was business common sense and that that again was why men got on better than womenThey knew the ropes better and she got in a nasty shot by asking why it was that my friend H got prices three times better for his books while she had a public twice as largeAt this point of his tale my friend H swore violentlyHe said again that this was what came of having to do with womenMiss Whe saidif she had been a man would have withdrawn her book unconditionally from the publishers She would not have permitted him to be insultedShe would have taken her stand on the broad eminence of principleshonour and etiquetteBut womenmy friend H observedhad no sense of honourof rectitudeor even of decencyMoreoverhe continuedevery woman was entirely wanting in the sense of what is honourable in menAlmost every woman was under the influence of some shocking bad hat or otherMiss Wwas an instance in pointShe got such low prices for her books because she was entirely under the thumb of XX was the managing director of the publishers in questionMy friend H went on to say that he was perfectly convinced that X was a shocking bad hat and with his firm was absolutely dishonestHe had told Miss W thishe had told her innumerable timesHe had begged her to take her books away from the firm which X administeredWhat X was up to now was no more nor less than trying to breed a quarrel between himself and Miss WX had always hated to think that H should have any influence with Miss W at allMiss W on the other hand was always in X s office and X was always pitching her some tale or other to prove that her books did not sellThat was X s way of doing businessHe got hold of a lot of women and had them there to tea every day and all day longAnd then hetold them that their books did not sell and got them on the cheapAnd MrHsaid that MrX had always hated himself because X had once tried to swindle him and had of course failed utterlyNow X had got the chance to kick him in the face and by Jovehe had taken it And the damnably irritating thing about it all MrHconcluded vindictively as it s the damnably irritating thing about all womenis that Miss W is by now convinced that the fellow X is a swindlerBut howI have been trying to make her believe it for yearsI am a sanehonourable and fairly distinguished personYet every word of warning that I have given her against X has glided off her like water from a duck s backBut the other day some sort of a little chap who is a clerk in another publisher s office comes to call upon her to take away some pictures for reproductionAnd this little chap tells her that X is dishonestAnd immediately she writes off to me to say that she had found X outA clerk had told her that he was dishonestNow there you have a womanWould she believe me who am an expert in publishers and publishingNot a bit of itBut she takes the word of the first understrapper that comes alongThat is woman And MrH in his agitation rushed away from me to tell his tale to someone elseHe said that he was going to write to the TimesBut as I have not seen his letterI presume the editor of that journal refused him hospitality in those respectable columnsMrH went away so quickly that I had not time to tell him that everyone in London knew perfectly well that he and Mr X had been angling for the affections of Miss W for the last five yearsIn fact they were just furiously jealous of each otherMrH had given MrX the chance to kick him in the face and MrXwho was a heavy manhad taken it with gleeI had wanted to tell MrH thatsince everyone that he could possibly speak to knew just what the state of affairs wasMrH would only be making himself ridiculous by trumpeting what was after all simply his own follyBut he gave me no timeI still sat reflecting in a deep chair and wondering whether the club waiter intended to bring me back the change for my tea or whether he would conveniently forget itAnd I was wondering toowhether I should muster up the courage to tell that menial that it was the third or fourth time that he had tried to play that trick upon me or whether for the third or fourth time I should let him pocket the sixpenceI began wondering why it was that all men are such cowards for club servantsAnd then I thought that if I had been a woman in a woman s club I should have got that sixpence back in the twinkling of an eyeI never got that sixpence backI do not know that I should not have had the courage to ask for itbut my attention was divertedI do not honestly think that I should have asked for itBut Reggie Spofforth was standing in front of the other fireplace at the end of the smoking roomHe was trying to keep his broad fat face seriousbut traces of smiles were peeping up at every minute round the corners of his mouthReggie Spofforth was the junior partner in the firm of SpofforthHawes and Spofforththe old established literary advisersHe wore gold spectacles and what he did not know of literary gossip would go into a club wine glassFrom an arm chair that was below him and hidden from me by a writing desk there went up the low babble of a monologue of which I could not catch the wordsMrSpofforth continued to smirk joyously whilst he tried not very successfully to appear serious and concernedAnd suddenly there burst forth in a voice of uncontolable emotion the words That is what it is to be trapped into having anything to do with a woman My friend H was once more rehearsing the story of his woesI began to reflect on H s caseSomething of the sort has happened to me several times on at least three occasionsOn each of these a young writerpublishing a first bookhad asked me to write a preface for himAnd on each of these occasions either the publisher or the writer himself had asked me to modify my preface becauseas I hope sufficiently to demonstrateI write very uncautiously and say exactly what I meanOn the other hand the only preface that I ever wrote which got through exactly as Î wrote it was written for a volume of translations by a womanLooking at MrSpofforth s faceMrSpofforth is I should say exactly the average man hhomme moyen sensuelI realised thatwhile MrSpofforth knew quite well of the jealousy between Messrs H and Xand while he was in consequence making allowances for both these gentlemenhe was at the same time exactly agreeing with everything that H said about Miss W as a womanAnd suddenly it came in my head to consider that this is how we men and women build up our respective views of each otherFor it is perfectly true that Miss W had treated Mr H with discourtesyand without proper attention to etiquetteBut she had done it by the orders of a manThis MrSpofforth would omit to noticeThis incident happened several years ago andsince that date because it awakened in me a certain train of thought I have in my mind been gathering together material for this bookI tried in the beginning to reduce my intelligence to a blankI tried to wipe the slate cleanI said to myselfLet me postulate for the sake of clearness of thoughtthat there is no difference between men and womenAnd thenI began to gather together the illustrationsI gathered them strictly from my own experience or from what I have the right to consider as first hand informationthat is to say from the direct experiences of friends as they have related them to meI have been trying to get at whatif anyis the essential difference between man and woman in the life that to day we lead in Western EuropeI do not profess to have studied the matter historicallyHistory is an excellent thing andwhen it is treated by scientific historians it becomes infinitely more misleading than anything that I could hope to writeThe first writer who paid much attention towho generalised much about the difference betweenthe sexes was of course ShakespeareI do not mean to say that Shakespeare was the first who ever wrote that woman was not to be trustedbut that he is the earliest writer and he is almost the only writer who has any influence in this matter over the minds of gentlemen like my friend MrSpofforthLet us just transcribe typical passages as to a gentleman s views respectively of the good and the bad of womanLet the first be from Cymbeline and the first gentleman Posthumus Could I find out The Woman s part in meFor there s no motion That tends to vice in man but I affirm It is the Woman s partBe it lyingnote itThe Woman sflatteringhersdeceivinghersLust and rank thoughtshershersrevenges herAmbitionscovetingschange of pridesdisdainNice

but a minute old for one Not half so old as thatI ll write against them Detest themcurse themYettis greater skill In a true hate to pray they have their will The very devils cannot plague them better I do not know of any particular quotation from Shakespeare as to the virtues of womenThere are so manyand most of them are hackneyedPossibly Iago in hissmall beerspeech expresses what was really Shakespeare s opinion of womenhis balanced and level headed viewBut let us set against Posthumus s views of his wife when he was angryhis view when he was pleasedIt will be observed that he is not so eloquent and that his opinion is reported for him by othersIachimoThat lady is not now livingor this gentleman s opinionby thisworn outPosthumusShe holds her virtue still and I my mindIachimoYou must not so far prefer her love hours of ItalyPosthumousBeing so far provoked as I was in FranceI would abate her nothingthough I profess myself her adorernot her friendIachimoAs fair and as gooda kind of hand in hand comparisonhad been something too fairand too goodfor any lady in BrittanyIf she went before others I have seenas that diamond of yours out lustres many I have beheldI could not but believe she excelled manybut I have not seen the most precious diamond that isnor you the ladyPosthumusI praised her as I rated herso do I my stoneIachimoWhat do you esteem it atPosthumousMore than the world enjoysIachimoEither your unparagoned mistress is dead or she s out prized by a triflePosthumusYou are mistakenthe one may be soldor givenor if there were wealth enough for the purchaseor merit for the giftthe other is not a thing for saleand only the gift of the godsIachimoWhich the gods have given youPosthumusWhichby their gracesI will keepWe thus arrive at an accurate impression of what was the equivalent in Shakespeare s view of a club man s estimate of womanYou will observe that it was pretty exactly the estimation that a South Sea Islander has of his godwho is an idol made of black wood and mother of pearlWhen his god pleases him this gentleman exclaims Oh divinity When his god fails to provide him with his desired meal of human flesh he takes a club and bangs the ugly object over the headIt is exactly in this way that we treat women to dayIt is exactly in this wayonly with this differenceWhen we are pleased with our women we exclaim Oh divinityYou are different from all your sex But when we are displeased we say Hateful beast you are exactly like all the rest of your sex And this is a very subtle and a very significant distinctionConsider how differently we approach menIf a man pleases usis honourable and all the rest of itwe say Oh he is a good sort of chap On the other hand I had a friend who shared my rooms with me for some timeHe was a great nuisanceHis toilet articles filled my room to overflowingI could not go into my bathroom without falling over half a dozen bottles of different scentsAnd on one occasion I heard a wild yella thud that shook the whole houseI rushed into my friend s bedroom and discovered this stalwart person he was six foot two in height and weighed seventeen stone stretched upon the floor in a dead faintHe had perceived a mouse upon his bedYeshe had perceived a mouse and he had faintedNo it did not immediately enter my head to sayThis infernal nuisance is as bad as all the rest of his sexHe uses an enormous number of scentsHe is remarkably untruthfulHe never tips the laundress of my chambersso that I have to tip her doubleHe faints and he yells when he sees a mouseHe is like all other men NoI did not say thisOn the contrary I just said to myself Poor fellowwhat can you expectHe went to Harrow while I went to Westminister On the other hand I do not know that men come any better out of this particular struggleFor the defects which are supposed to be exclusively masculine are by womenscored up against my unfortunate sex in a manner much more subterranean but none the less obstinateI had a great great aunt called BromleyMy great great aunt Bromley had a nieceThis niece was very happily married to a gentleman called Tristram MadoxShe had everything that in those days the wife of man could desirean elegant and substantial establishmentturtle soup once a weeklimes for concocting punch24 The Little Review a carriage and pairand affectionate healthy and obedient children as well as a healthy affectionate and properly patronizing husband whom she always addressed asMrMadoxand spoke of astheMaster One day she made the extraordinary discovery that her husband possessed also another establishmenta mistress and several childrenAll at once MrsMadox s happiness went to piecesShe still possessed her substantial establishment the carriage and pairMrMadox still patronized herher children were still healthyaffectionate and obedientBut a blight had come over all these desirable possessionsthe world appeared to her a desertFor consolation she sought my great great auntAnd Miss Bronley who was of great age and was accounted wise beyond most peopleMiss Bromley uttered these words that I was always taught to consider memorable M y dear she said You can never trust a man when he is out of your sight And these words I was always taught as I have said to consider memorableMy grandfather would relate this anecdote upon every appropriate and upon many inappropriate occasionsAnd this remarkable speechwhenever he related it was always received with the most extraordinary applauseYet actually no remark was ever more imbecileFor of course you can trust nobodyneither a man nor a woman when he or she is out of your sightI was talking the other day to a distinguished Russian exilewho has for many years lived in EnglandHe purports to be a considerable observer of lifeI dare say he isAt any rate he writes admired letters as to English social affairs once a week to the Petersburgkaia Viedemosti or some journal of the sortMy friend said thatupon his first coming to England he was immensely impressed with the orderliness and regularity of British marital conditionsAll wives were faithful and devotedit appeared to himand all husbands faithful and attachedEvery where there reigned a deep calma sort of undreamt of and holy Pax BritannicaHe seemed to himself to have strayed into some Garden of EdenEverywhere were smilespolitenessconcordAnd this struck him as all the more remarkable because he came from Russia where as far as I could understand him there reigned a sort of orderly disorderApparently in that Empire the rule was that you married with the blessings of the Church and then quarrelled more or less outrageously with the partner of your joys and sorrowsThen by mutual agreement you separated and each of the parties contracted another union which was quite irregular because the Russian Church does not admit of divorceNevertheless the second unionas if the first had purged the parties by fire so as to render them comparatively tolerant of the fault and failings of others this second union was as a rule permanent and satisfactoryBut this terrible state of things was so normal in Russia thatas I have saidconditions in England struck my friend as those of concord surpassing beliefBut that had been only for the first year or soApparently Count P was one of those mild and trustworthy persons to whom the unhappy come for confession and for consolation don t know exactly who his friends in England wereBut I could hazard a guess that they were mild and earnest creatures of advanced views and unsuspected respectabilitya sort of inverted society of puritans all wearing flannel next their skinsCount P assured me that he did not know a single household in England where beneath the surface conditions of domestic life were not absolutely appalling even to his Russian mindOn the surface these estimable married people went about together and smiled one upon the otherBut what really upset my Russian friend was that apparently English people could not even be faithful in their irregular unionsI don t know what may be the worth of Count P s observationsHe made them to me while we were watching the results of a late general election come in at Trafalgar SquareWe were watching the magic lantern sheet of one of the great Liberal organsCount P cheered wildly at every Liberal success and groaned in a becoming manner at the announcement of every Tory victoryElection results becoming scarce the magic lantern began to show portraits of prominent Liberal politicians all of whom Count P recognisedSuddenly there appeared an atrociously ugly caricature in pinks and greensIt represented a gentleman with an immense and purky nosea huge eyeglassand an expression of dismay at the result oflet us saythe Grimsby electionIn the button hole of the caricature was represented an enormous orchidBeneath it was written What price Jonow My Russian friend said Who s thatWho s that excitedlyI explained whom the caricature represented Nono Count P exclaimed you don t know English journalistsThey are chivalrous gentlemenThe man you mention is illis disabled and dyingNo English political journalist would permit himself to caricature an old dying statesman The Little Review The sheet continued to show pictures of the gentleman with the eyeglass and the orchida whole series of them depicting him in various attitudes of degradationUnder each one was written Jo My Russian friend insisted that I did not know English journalists and that this could not be the politician familiarly denoted by those two lettersIt must be the leader of the Irish partythe president of the United States or Lord LansdowneHe repeated that no Liberal journalist would to day caricature MrChamberlainthat no journalist in England would caricature a dying statesmanand he repeated that English journalists were chivalrous gentlemenI remembered that the day before a prominent English journalist had printed a private letter which I had incautiously addressed to him and I cordially agreed with Count PAnd then Count P explained to me the reason why English journalists were so much more chivalrous than their brothers of Russia and more particularly of PolandIn Russia and more particularly in Poland politics are carried onas far as the active side is concernedvery largely by womenThe men are much more theoretic and Count P was careful to inform me that women have no sense of chivalryAt that moment the sheet showed MrChamberlain being sick into basinAnd once more Count P repeated You don t know English journaliststhey are chivalrous gentlemen So that perhaps my Russian friend was not an exactly trustworthy observerHe may have viewed English matrimonial arrangements with a jaundiced eyejust as he kept a very rosy one for the gentlemen who daily instruct this countryI don t knowAnd I don t know that it all affects my argumentMy great greataunt said that you can never trust a man when he is out of your sightAnd this wise saw has been applauded by tens of thousands of womenIt is accepted as a brilliant and indisputable discoveryLet me add another discovery which seems to me all the more brilliant and all the more indisputable because I believe it is a discovery entirely of my ownI have at least never met a woman to whom this singular fact occurredBut the fact is that no man ever went wrong in this particular matter without having a woman to go wrong with himIn the nature of the case the number of immoral women must be exactly the same as the number of immoral menThe statistics must come out exactly equal so that my great great uncle Madox might just as well have said My boyyou cannot trust a woman out of your sight And of course you can tI am in the nature of things not as well asquainted with the psychology of women in this matter as I am with that of menAs I hope later to point out since I am writing what is only another volume of reminiscences I have personally been treated badly by men who behaved as if they were wolvesOn the other hand I have been badly treated by women who behaved as if they were hyenasI do not know that there is much difference in the methods of these two animalsWolves are more inclined to run in packs but the other quadruped has the more formidable teeth when it comes to crushing your bonesThat is why I have selected these two animals as illustrationsFor I have noticed that when men of that disposition imagined that I wasdown as the saying isthey jumped upon me four or five or fourteen or fifteen at a timeThe women on the other hand went about their jobs of stealing my furniture or my reputation or whatever it was they wantedthey went about it as solitary beasts of preysilently but much more efficientlyBut that I am aware is largely because I am a rather observant person and have generally been able to prevent women from getting about me in packsIt is much more difficult for a man to prevent men doing thisbecause a man has to deal so much more frequently with bodies of men Hommo homini lupusthe old writer says man behaves to his fellow man like a wolf And when one has grasped this essential and necessary fact one has achieved something like heaven on earthfor one will have ceased to expect anything more of one s fellowsSo that I cannot for myself very well differentiate between man and woman in these particular aspectsWoman declares that she is more tender and more tactful than manbut the most careful tendernesses and the most exquisite tactfulness that I have personally met with have been at the hands of one or two menSimilarly man in the eyes of woman is a coarse and unimaginative animalYet certainly the coarsest person I ever met was a womanAnd I have seldom met I have metbut veryvery seldom a woman who possessed the instinctive gift of imagination which is sympathyI am notyou understandlaying down any lawsPerhaps men are the coarserperhaps women are the more tenderBut the point that I desire to make is that having knocked about the occidental world in many corners and in half a dozen countrieshaving met more persons that I can well numberI cannot see that in these particulars or in any particulars woman differs essentially from man The Little Review Of course the female housekeeper of an English lord s castle will differ from a major in a German infantry regimentThe fact that she has stopped indoors for the greater part of her life will probably make her more hystericalOn the other hand I happened to meet the other day a major in a German infantry regiment who was the most hysterically sensitive being I have ever come acrossHe had fought more than twenty duels over imaginary insults and he was eventually cashiered after an occasion of the sortBut I do not mean to adduce from this that all German officers of the rank of majors are distinguished by hysteria and sensitivenessAs a rule they are notBut had I been an observer of mankind like my great aunt Bromleyand had 1 been possessed of the theory that all men were hystericalI should have stored up that particular major in the note books of my memory and I should have neglected to notice any other man until I came across one who was distinguished by similar nervous eccentricitiesThe subject is one singularly difficult to tackleI have just put down thatin my personal experiencemen have acted more frequently in packs when they have desired to victimise me and that women as a rule have operated solitarilyNow I am quite aware that there are certain sex theorists WeiningerSchopenhauer RuskinJohn Stuart MillMrBernard Shawand Solomon the author of the proverbs being among themwhoif they do me the honour to read this workwill say at once Hahere we find this author confirming what we have always saidWomen are incapable of concerted action And I am perfectly aware that this statement of mine is the only one that they will noticefor they will set down the rest of this book as airy persiflageSo the sex legend has been built upBy good Christians you will daily hear it alleged that woman is an inferior animal because she lacks physical and moral courageThey close their eyes to the fact in the story of the Crucifixion that it was the mother of Christ who took the risk of lingering last beside the Cross and of being the first to go to her son s gravePalestine at that date was rather a dangerous place in which to manifest sympathy or concern for the seed of DavidYet the Virgin Mary was surely a womanIn the same spirit you will hear a good Frenchman declare that woman is necessarily an inferior animal because she cannot lead armiesAnd immediately afterwards he will go and lay a wreath upon the statue of Joan of ArcSimilarly the other day I heard an excellent English scholar and gentleman declare that woman was an inferior animal because no woman had ever been a first rate poetImmediately afterwards he became he was in another mood then almost lachrymose over the line I loved thee Athis in times pastYet this line is by SapphoMy friend was at that moment trying to persuade me that Swinburne in translating these words had allowed all of their majestyof their magic and of their mastery yeshe saidmasteryto escapeYet Algernon Charles Swinburne was a manThe fact is that no sooner does either man or woman approach this theme of the difference between the sexes than straightway all reason deserts himHe may be the most powerful reasoner such as was Schopenhauerhe may be a slightly hysterical novelist like Strindberghe may be a great poet like ShakespeareBut the never failing rule with man as well as with woman is to revenge in his public utterances his private wrongs against a sexI was once in an omnibus with a lady and another manA man got up to go outand the busskiddingthe poor man on his feet was thrown against my charming friendOne of his boots considerably damaged her thin summer skirt and she was quite properly angryBut did she abuse the driver of the busOr did she say that motor buses are horrible inventions because of their skidding propertiesNot at allShe looked at me in whom she had a certain proprietary interest and she remarked Why have all men feet as large as elephants Yetfor the mere trouble of looking down she would have observed that the friend who was with us had feet actually smaller than her ownAnd he was a manQuite a manly manin fact he held the Oxford record for the mileBut indeed this gentleman s feet were so small that oncewhen he as well as the lady was stopping with meI rang the bell to tell the servant to bring in his bootswhen she brought them I blew her up because I thought from their size that they must be the boots of the lady in questionYet actually they were the boots of my friendthe holder of the mile recordThat was how I came to know that his feet were smaller than those of the lady who said that the feet of all men were even as those of the largest quadrupedsSimilarlyhaving as I have already pointed out been outrageously robbed by several housekeepers and female dependents to whom I had been a great deal more kindly than was at all necessaryI might subscribe to the theory that womenare incapable of concerted action for the purpose of plunder or for any other purposeI The Little Review might say I have been robbed only by solitary femalesTherefore the female of man is always a robber and always robs singlyShe is a hyena not a wolfI might with the light and skilful pen in that way revenge myself upon my late housekeepers by abusing the whole sexIf I do not do itit is in part because I have a sense of humourAnd I should say that in England to some extentand in the United States enormouslyvery largely in Germanyvery largely in Russia and Holland but hardly at all in Francethat generally over the occidental world the prime cause of the domestic misery and of the domestic dissatisfaction that exist is precisely that each separate household has as its theoretic base an association of dependent women packing together against the made head of the houseI can imagine nothing more terrible than the domestic conditions of the large bulk of ordinaryrespectable and apparently tranquil middle class familiesHere you will have a goodhonestrather stupidrather fat manHe will be a mere machine all his lifeAt home there will besayfive women and two sonsAnd this man from any intellectualsocialor political point of view will be worse than a logHe will be too tired to read a booktoo tired to follow a political argumenttoo tired to join in an intelligent conversationSo he will be too tired all his lifeand to what end In order to support this monstrous regiment of five women and two sons whobecause they are allied with the five women for the purposes of extracting money from this wretched helotmay be counted as only two more womenEven upon the surface it is a really hideous pictureBut the moment you inquire a little deeper you discover that things are infinitely more repulsiveFor all those five women and their two allies will be linked against that sweating day labourerOfficially he is the master of the houseActually he isHefor all the householdAndbecause all his household the wifethe daughterthe three maid servants and the sonsbecause they are all nothing more nor less than parasitic

Fate had destined AThim for a high sphereyet how inexpressibly sordid Life wasHe became a philosophical anarchistLaterwhen he found that Shelley too had been an anarchisthis pride knew no boundsThen the greatness of his destiny made it impossible to risk it by throwing bombsNevertheless he was convinced that bomb throwing was the only panaceaFortunately for his self respect he remembered thatTh e pen is mightier than the sword At eighteen he was embarrassed by the frequency with which middle aged women fell on his neckhailing him as the poetical genius of the futureHe began to take it for grantedTherefore he cut his hairwore a bowlerdid his utmost in fact to look like a stockbroker and man of spiritfor he thoughtsince the greatness of my future is so certainwhy waste energy in trying to look itBesides what is more intriguing than a dark horse Alasthe very women who had been the first to tell him of his divine missionnow spurned him W e were mistaken they said to each other After allhe has the mind of a stockbroker At nineteen he was surprised by the frequency with which young women fell in love with himNot because he was a man nor even because of his art but because he looked so girlish they said Was ithe could not refrain from asking himself a refined form of Lesbianism His whole soul revolted at the ideaHe spent long hours pushing his chin forwardhe got drunk quite frequentlyhe became a specialist in bawdy housesHe adopted a brutal and incisive form of speech with these womenand allowed no subject to be taboo in discussionAlasthey were only the more convinced of his profound femininityIt was exactly the way they talked to each otherStrangely enoughalthough his poetry was of heroic mouldhe was a cowardThe idea of physical injury made him sick and he could not bear to tread on a worm Nodear readerhe was not such a coward as to be afraid of it turning If he passed over a bridge where children were playinghis heart would stop beating and his knees liquefy under him at the thought that one of them would fall inin which case he would have to dive the hundred feet or so into the waterperhaps get weteven perhaps a coldrisk his destiny for the sake of a slum bratfor unfortunately he could swim and dive toobut not very wellOne day at Margatehe was a poet whose destiny was to describe the life of his time he had finished bathing and was in his machine looking out to seaHe saw a girl and a man swim outwith a tide strongly runningThen the man turned back and the girl threw up an armand criedHelp He was scandalised to see that the man had left her and that no one else went inFeeling the world to be full of injustice he realised that after all he would have to go inHe dropped into the water casually first putting on his wet costumeles convenances must be observedand pulled her outHe had to sweat over itbut managed it finally by swimming obliquely against the tideBoth collapsed on the beachThen the girl murmuredThank you and disappearedThe crowd cheeredHe went into his tentHe realised now how heroes were madequite casuallyjust like thatHe dressed himselfand after a proper interval left the machine proudly as befitted a heroprepared to receive the acclamationperhaps even a collection from the crowd who had witnessed the deedAt leasthe thoughtmy photograph in the Mirror ought to sell out those damned sonnetsAnd the girl ah the girl she would surely be waiting to throw her arms round his neck and be his brideThere was nobody on the beach he looked on every hand not even a Mystic Choir anywhereAnd the thin clapping of dead leaves mocked himOf course he was in lovequite often in factEach new woman was that one for which his whole soul had longedShe alone was the one vision who had solaced his sleepless nightsvisiting him in dreamsNever was poet so rhapsodicalnever woman so idolisednever union more inspiringAlassoon she began to cryGive me breadmeatchildren He wasof coursepennilessThere was the usual sceneShe said he had no right to be a poet without a rich father behind himIt was directly contrary to Novelette precedentWhat about ShelleyetcI can t live on airif you can She slammed the front doorWhen he was thus desertedhe would question himself Am I unhappy Yesthere was no use denying ithe was Joyhe cried for only through suffering shall one gain eternal life iewrite eternal poetryWhile he wrote the sonnet inspired by the abovehe was already seeing how it would go to the EditorThe postman would throw it into thesanctumwith a pile of other lettersHe pictured the Editor s amazementwhen he opened his sonnetread his letterand how he would admire the dignity of the covering letter Dear Sirherewith I beg to enclose you a sonnet which you may care to printI amSiretc Here was the poet for whom the Editor had sought so longHe would rush outhail a taxidash up to the poet s doortake him home and give him a square meal at lastbuy all his other stuff at incredible sums a lineAlashis father died before ever he had a sonnet acceptedand he had put 2000 into the dving Reclame firstTherefore the sonnet appeared in The ReclameOne day he was in a bad moodHis anger grew with every word of the story he was telling to his large friendSo thenshe said do you like my new frockAdmirableI saidAnd do you love me better in it NoI saidthinking of the sonnets she d promised to print with the money I think it s a nice frockbut not more pleasant than your other frocksor no frock at all for that matterOne knows of course that people must have frocks sometimes Yesshe saidI simply had toJust as sometimes I have to have smart hatsjust as I have to have youThey re all just as necessary to me as each otherSometimes my only desire is a hator else it s a box at the theatreor else its a frock or elseand then she beamed at meit s you There was a ferocious silence which irked the friendand to break it he saidWellwhat did you say to that SayI strangled her At twenty one he decided the time had come for his Magnum OpusIt was to be a novelAt last the human soul would be torn baredisclosed in all its innate vileness and nobilityWith the object of unveiling Isishe therefore said to his sweetheart Darlingthere must have been times when you hated mewhen you felt you d burst if you had to see me ever againand all because of things I had done unwittingly and which offended you the more because of itIts no good denying itbecause it always happens in all love Yesall rightshe said But you tell me yours firstNoyou firsthe said No youthen I promise I willNo youhe replied then I willWhat must his thoughts have been like she thought since he s so ashamed to own them and left him there and then and foreverAt the age of twenty five he had writtenin chronological ordera volume of sonnetsa novela

dinner jacket an air of ferocious melancholy Wellwhat are you writing nowJohn they would ask Nothinghe would reply shortly What s the good of the damned gameI want to knowAll dust and ashesIn a hundred years where is it allNoI m going abroadI mean to have a good time winewomen and songI ve talked about it long enoughheaven knowsThe only thing that kept me at it in the old The Little Review days was the thought that the old man would go on till I was fifty or so and I d have to keep going somehow When they had gone he remained in thoughtAn insidious voice whispered in his earThat little scene now would make a good prose poemNot for publicationof coursebut just interestingIt wouldn t take you a few minutesJust the poet now wealthy literature forsworn for ever and everstretching out his hand to a sheet of paper What an old hypocrite you areJohn he said as he went into the libraryWhen his father died he went abroadHis destiny went with him and gave him no restThen he thoughtEven if I rescue my name from oblivion for a hundred years onlyit would have been worth whileA hundred years why the mere fact of printing a book gains it admission to the British Museum LibrarySurely that institution must last as long as the British Empireie for ever and ever So thenit would be quite a simple matter to last as long as any of the classics in that superb libraryHe decided that the means of lasting to Eternity were too simpletoo easily procured for one of so electric a mind as himselfIt was like preserving coprolitesHe was glad he could afford to forego LiteratureA SOLDIER OF HUMOUR Wyndham Lewis PART IIBURGOS WAS to break my journeyBut San Sebastian and Leon seemed eventually better halting placesThis four days journeying was an interlude an entr acte filled with appropriate musicthe lugubrious and splendid landscapes of Castilethe extremely selfconscious pedantic and independent spirit of its inhabitantsmet with en routeFate was marking timemerelyOn with the second day s journey I changed trains and dined at Venta de Banos the junction for the line that branches off in the direction of PalenciaLeon and the Gallician countryThe Spanish peoplewhile travellinghave a marked preference The Little Review for the next compartment to that that they have chosenNo sooner has the train started than one after anotherheadsarms and shoulders appear above the wooden partitionand you occasionally have the entire human contents of the neighbouring compartment gazing gloomily into your ownIn the case of some theatrical savage of the Sierraswho rears a dishevelled head before you in a pose of fierce abandon hangs there smokingyou know that it may be some instinctive pride that prevents him from remaining in an undignified position huddled in a narrow carriageIn other cases it is probably a naive conviction that the occupants of other compartments are likely to be more interestingThe whole way from Venta de Banos to Palencia the carriage was dense with peopleCrowds of peasants poured into the trainloaded with their heavy vivid horse rugsgaudy bundles and basketswhich profusion of mere mattercombined with their exuberancemade the carriage appear positively to swarm with human lifeThey would crowd in at one little station and out at another a short way along the linewhere they were met by hordes of their relations awaiting themThey would rush or swing out of the doorcharged with their goods and accoutrements and catch the nearest man or woman of their blood in their arms with a turbulence that outdid Northernersmost vehement occasionsThe waiting group became at least twice as vital as ordinary human beingson the arrival of the trainas though so much more blood had poured into their veinsGradually we got beyond the sphere of this Fiesta and in the small hours of the morning arrived at LeonNext day came the final stage of the journey to the Atlantic sea boardWe arrived within sight of the town that evening just as the sun was settingWith its houses of greenrose and whitein general effect rather subdued and fadedit was like some Oriental town in the nerveless tempera tints of a frescoIts baythirty miles long reached out to the seaOn the train drawing up in the Central stationfurious contingents furnished by every little raggamuffin café as well as every stately hotel in the town were hurled against usI had mislaid the address given me at BayonneI wished to find a hotel of medium luxury half way between the ghastly bouge and the princely hostelryThis was a method with meThe different hotel attendants called hotly out their prices at meI selected one who named a sum for board and lodging that only the frenzy of competition could have fatheredI thoughtAlso the name of this hotel wasit seemed to methe one the Patrona at Bayonne had mentionedI had not then learnt to connect Burgaleza with BurgosWith this man I took a cab and was left seated in it at the door of the station while he went after the heavy luggageNow one by one the hotel emissaries came upqueer contrast between their fury of a few minutes before and their present listless calmPutting themselves civilly at my dispositionthey thrust forward matter of factly the card of their establishmentadding that they were sure that I would find out my mistakeI now felt in a vague manner a tightening of the machinery of Fate a certain uneasiness and strangeness in the march and succession of facts and impressionslike the trembling of a motor bus about to start againThe interlude was overAfter a long delay the hotel man returned and we startedThe method I have spoken of consisted in a realization of the following factswhen your means are very restrictedit is best to go to a cheap hotel and pay a few pesetas more a day forextras This is satisfactory than affecting second class housesYou can never be sure in any hotel especially in Spainof the menu not containing every dish you most loatheBut there is something privatealmost home madeabout ExtrasYou always feel that a single individual has bent over the extra and carefully cooked it and that it has not been bought in too wholesale a mannerI wished to live on Extras a privileged existenceThe cabman and hotel man were discussing some local eventBut we penetrated farther and farther into a dismal and shabby quarter of the townI began to have misgivingsI asked the representative of the Burgaliza if he were sure that his house was a clean handsome and comfortable houseHe dismissed my doubtful glance with a gesture full of assurance It s a splendid placeYou wait and seewe shall be there directlyhe addedWe suddenly emerged in a broad and imposing streeton one side of which was a public garden El Paseo I found out afterwardsthe Town PromenadeGazing idly at a vast palatial white building with an hotel omnibus drawn up before itto my astonishment I found our driver also stopping at its doorA few minutes laterin a state of stupefactionI got out and entered this palacenoticingBurgalezaon the board of the omnibusI followed dumblyhaving glimpses in passing of a superbly arrayed table with serviettes that were each a work of art that a diner would soon haughtily pull to pieces to wipe his moustache on tables groaning beneath salvers full of fruit and other delicaciesThen came a long halldarkly panelledat the end of which I could see several white capped men shouting fiercely and clashing kniveswomen answering shrilly and rattling dishes a kitchenthe most diabolically noisy and nauseous I had ever approachedWe went straight on towards itWere we going through itAt the very threshold we stoppedand opening a panel like door in the wallthe porter disappeared with my portmanteauappeared again without my portmanteauand hurried awayAt this moment my eye caught something elsea door ajar on the other side of the passage and a heavy woodenclothless tablewith several squares of bread on itand a fork or twoIn Spain there is a sort of bread for the richand a horrible looking juiceless papery bread for the humbleThe bread on that table was of the latter categorySuddenly the truth flashed upon meWith a theatrical gesture I dashed open again the panel and passed into the pitchy gloom withinI struck a matchIt was a cupboardquite windowlesswith just enough room for a little bedI was standing on my luggageNo doubt in the room across the passage I should be given some cod souppermanganate of potash and artificial breadThenextremely tired after my journeyI should crawl into my kennelthe pandemonium of the kitchen at my ear for several hoursIn the central hall I found the smiling proprietorHe seemed to regard his boarders geneally as a mild jokeand those who slept in the cupboard near the kitchen a particularly good but rather low oneI informed him that I would pay the regular sum for a day s board and lodging and said I must have another roomA valet accepted the responsibility of seeing I was given a bedroomand the landlord walked slowly awayhis iron grey side whiskerswith their traditional air of respectabilitygiving a disguised look to his rascally faceI was transferred from one cupboard to anotherOr ratherI had exchanged a cupboard for a wardrobe reduced to just half its size by a thick layer of skirts and cloakstwenty deepthat protruded from all four wallsBut still the little open space left in the centre would ensure me a square foot to wash and dress inwith a quite distinct square foot or two for sleepAnd it was upstairsA quarter of an hour laterwandering along a dark passage on my way back to the central halla door opened in a very violent and living way and a short rectangular figurethe size of a big square trunkissued forthjust in front of meI recognized this figure fragmentarily firstwith a cold shudderI recognized an excrescence of hairthen with a jump I recognized a hat held in its handthenwith a shrinkingI realized that I had seen those flat pseudo American shoulders beforeWith a tidal wave of surging emotionI then recognized the whole manIt was the implacable figure of the Fonda del MundoHe moved along with wary rigidity aheadshowing no reciprocal sign of recognitionHe turned corners with difficultywith a sort of rapid lurch and seemed to get stuck on the stairs just as a large American trunk wouldborne by a sweating porterAt last he safely reached the hallI was a yard or two behind himHe stopped to light a cigarstill taking up an unconscionable amount of spaceI manoeuvred round himand gained one of the doors of the salle a mangerBut as I came within his range of visionI also became aware that my presence in the house was not a surprise to this sandwich man of Western citizenshipHis eye fastened on mewith ruthless bloodshot indignationa crystallised eye blast of the Bayonne episodeI had distinctly the impression of being face to face with a ghosthe was so dead and inactiveAnd in all my subsequent dealings with himthis feeling of having to deal with a ghostalthough a particulary mischievous onepersistedIf beforemy anger at the trick that had been played on me had dictated a speedy change of lodgingnow my anxiety to quit this roof hadnatuarallya tremendous incentiveAfter dinnerI went forth boldly in search of the wonderful American enemySurely I had been condemnedin some indirect wayby himto the cupboard beside the kitchenNo dungeon could have been worseHad I then knownas I learnt laterthat he was the owner of this hotelthe mediaeval analogy would have been still more completeHe now had me in his castleI found himin sinister conjunction with the Proprietor or Manager as I suppose he wasin the lobby of the hotelHe turned slightly away as I came up to himwith a sulky indifference due to self restraintEvidently the time for action was not ripeThere was no pretence of not recognising meAs though our conversation in the Fonda del Mundo had taken place a half an hour beforewe acknowledged in no way a consciousness of the lapse of timeonly of the shifted scene Wellcolonel I saidadopting an allocution of the United States taking the air He went on smoking This is a nice little townI m glad you like it he replied in Frenchas though I was not worthy even to hear his American accentand thatif any communication was to be held with meFrench must serve I shall make a stay of some weeks here I said with indulgent defiance OuiBut not in this Hotel He got up with something of his Bayonne look about him NoI shouldn tYou might not find it a very comfortable hotel He walked away hurriedlyas a powder magazine might walk away from a fuseif it did notfor some reasonwant to blow up for the momentThe upstairs and less dreadful dungeon with its layers of clotheswould have been an admirable place for a murderNot a sound would have penetrated its woolen masses and thick Spanish wallsBut the next morning I was still alive when I woke upI set out after breakfast to look for new quartersMy practised eye had soon measured the inconsistencies of most of the pensions of the townBut a place in the Calle Real suited me all right and I decided to stop there for the timeThis room again was a cupboardBut it was a human cupboard and not a clothes cupboardIt was one of four tributaries of the dining roomMy bedroom door was just beside my place at tablethe entire animal life being conducted over an area not exceeding fiftten compact square feetThe extracting of my baggage from the Burgaleza was easy enoughexcept that the rogue of a proprietor charged a heavy tollsunk somewhere in the complications of the billAs at Bayonnethere was no sign of the enemy in the morningBut I was not so sure this time that I had seen the last of himThat evening I came amongst my new fellow pensionnaires for the first timeThis place had recommended itself to me partly because the boarders would probably speak good SpanishThey were mostly CastiliansM y presence caused no stir whateverJust as a stone dropped in a small pond which has long been untouched and has a good thick coat of mildewslips dully to the bottomcutting a clean little hole on the surface slimeso I took my place at the bottom of the tableBut as the pond will send up its personal odour at this intrusionso these people revealed something of themselves in the first few minutesin an illusive and immobile wayThey must all have lived in that pension together for an inconceivable length of timeMy neighbour however promised to be a little El Dorado of Spanisha small mine of gossipgrammatical rules and willingness to impart his native richesI struck a deep shaft of friendship into him at once and began work without delayHe yielded in the first three days a considerable quantity of pure ore coming from Madridthis ore was at least 30 carotthoroughly thétaed and CastilianWhat I gave him in exchange was insignificantI taught him nothingHe knew several phrases in French and Englishsuch as if you pleaseandfine day I merely confirmed him in theseEvery day he would hesitatingly say them overand I would assent quite rightandvery well pronounced and then turn to extracting his natural riches from him for the next hour or twoHe was a tall bearded manhead of the orchestra of the principal café in the townTwo large cuffs lay on either side of his plate during mealsthe size of serviettesand out of them his hands emerged without in any way disturbing them and served him with his food as far as they couldBut he had to remain with his mouth quite near his platefor the cuffs would not move a hair s breadthThis somewhat annoyed meas it muffled a little the steady flow of Spanishand even was a cause of considerable wasteI tried to move the cuffs once or twice without successTheir ascendancy over him and their indolence were phenomenalBut I was not content merely to extract Spanish from himI wished to see it in useto watch this stream of Spanish working the mill of general conversationfor instanceButalthough willing enough himselfhe had no chance in this PensionOn the third day he invited me to come round to the café after dinner and hear him playOur dinners overlappedhe leaving earlySodinner overI strolled roundaloneThe café Pelayo was the only really Parisian establishment in the townIt was the only one where the Madrilenos and other Spaniards properresident in Ponta Issandrawent regularlyI enteredpeering round in a business like way at its monotonously mirrored walls and gilded ceilingThis was a building that must contain prodigious quantities of Spanish every eveningHere I should virtually pass my examinationIn a lull of the musicmy chef d orchestre came over to meand presented me to a large group ofconsommateurs friends of hisIt was an easy matterfrom that momentto become acquainted with everybody in the caféI did not approach Spaniards in general with any very romantic notionEach man I met possessed equally an ancient and admirable tonguehowever degenerate himselfHe often appeared like some rotten treein which a swarm of words had nestedIlike a bee cultivatorfound it my business to transplant this vagrant swarm to a hive prepared in which already two kindred swarms were billetedas I have saidA language has its habits and idiosyncrasies just like a species of insectas my first professor comfortably explainedits thousands of little words and parts of speech have to be carefully studied and manipulatedSo I had my hands fullWhen the café closedI went home with Don Pedrochef d orchestreto the PensionEvery eveningafter dinner and at lunch time as well I repaired thereThis lasted for three or four daysI now had plenty of opportunity of talking SpanishI had momentarily forgotten my American enemyOn the fifth eveningI entered the Café as usualmaking towards my most useful and intelligent groupBut thenwith a sinking of the heartI saw the rectangular form of my ubiquitous enemyquartered with an air of demoniac permanence in their midstA mechanic who finds a big lump of alien metal stuck in the very heart of his machinery what simile shall I find for my dismayTo proceed somewhat with this imageas this unhappy engineer might dash to the cranks or organ stops of his machineso I dashed to several of my formerly most willing listeners and talkersI gave one a wrench and another a screw but I found that already the machine had become recalcitrantI need not enumerate the various stages of my defeat on that eveningIt was more or less a passive and moral battlerather than one with any evident show of the secretly bitter and desperate nature of the passions engagedOf coursethe inclusion of so many people unavoidably caused certainbrusquerieshere and thereThe gradual cooling down of the whole room towards methe dreadful icy currents of dislike that swept over the chain of little drinking groups little eddiesor tiny whirlpools of conversation from that mystical centre of hostilitythat soul that recognised in me something icily antipodean toono doubtthe immobile figure of America s newest and most mysterious childapparently emitting these strong waves without effortas naturally as a fountainall thiswith great vexationI felt happening almost in the first momentIt almost seemed as though he had stayed away from this haunt of his foreseeing what would happenHe had waited until I was settled and there was something palpable to attackHis absence may have had some more natural causeWhat exactly he said about me I never discoveredAs at Bayonne I saw the mouth working and I felt the effects onlyNo doubt it was the subtlest and most electric thing that could be foundbriefsearching and annihilatingPerhaps something seemingly crude that I was a spy may have recommended itself to his ingenuityBut I expect it was a meaningless or rather indefiniteblast of disapprobation that he blew upon mean eerie and stinging The Little Review wind of personal unexplained scorn and hatredHe evidently exercised a queer ascendancy in the café Pelayoexplained superficially by his commercial prestigebut clue really to his extraordinary character moulded by the sublime force of his illusionHis inscrutable immobilityhis unaccountable self controlfor such a personand feeling as he did towards mewere of course the American or Anglo Saxon coolness and coldness as reflectedor portrayedin this violent human mirrorI left the Café earlier than usualbefore the chef d orchestreIt was the following morning at lunch when I next saw himHe was embarrassedHis eyes wavered in my direction fascinated and inquisitiveHe found it difficult to realise that his respect for me had to end and give place to another feeling You know Monsieur de Valmore he asked That little cur of a Frenchmando you meanI knew this description of my wonderful enemy was vulgar and inexactBut often with an ordinary intercourse it is necessary to be vulgar and inexactBut this way of describing Monsieur de Valmore appeared to the chef d orchestre so eccentricapart from its profanitythat I lost at once in Don Pedro s sympathyHe told mehoweverall about himvulgar details that did not touch on the real conditions of this life He owns the Burgaleza and many houses in PontaisandraShipstooEs Americanohe addedThe American War was still fresh in the memory of all SpaniardsBut being obviously a Frenchmanthey could allow themselves to admire in him all the commercial cunning and other qualities that their disgusted souls admired in the YankeeVexations and hindrances of all sorts now made my stay in Pontaissandra useless and depressingDon Pedro had generally almost finished when we came to dinner and I was forced to shut up the mineso to speakNothing more was to be extractedexcept uncomfortable monosyllablesThe rest of the boarders remained morose and inaccessibleI went once more to the Café Palâyobut the waiters even seemed affectedThe new café I chose yielded nothing but Gallego chatterand the garçon was not gregariousThere was little encouragement to try another pension and stay on in PontaissandraI made up my mind to go to CorunaThis would waste a bit of timeBut there is more Gallego than Spanish spoken in Galiciaeven in the citiesToo easily automatic a conquest as it may seemMonsieur de Valmore had left me nothing but the GallegosI was not getting anything like the practice in Spanish necessaryand this necessity infected the whole air of the placeI began to get neuresthenic about the necessity of learning this tiresome languageI would go to Coruna in any caseOn the following daysome hours before the time for the trainI paraded the line of streets towards the stationwith the feeling that I was no longer thereThe place seemed cooling down and growing strange already prematurely and looked very cheerlessBut the miracle happenedcoming with a gradual flowering of beautyA more beautiful checkmate never occurred in any record of exquisite war fareThe terrible ethnological difference that existed between Monsieur de Valmore and myself up till that moment showed every sign of ending in a weird and revolting defeat for meThemomentI refer to was that in which I turned out of the High Streetinto the short hilly avenue where the Post Office layI had some letters to postcommunications adorned with every variety of expletives about SpanishPontassandra and other opposite thingsOn turning the corner I at once became aware of three anomalous figures walking just in front of meThey were all three of the proportion known in certain climes ashusky When I say they were walkingI should describe their movements more accurately as wading wading through the airevidently towards the Post OfficeTheir carriage was slightly rollinglike a ship under weighThey occasionally bumped into each otherbut did not seem to mind thisYet no one would have mistaken these three young men for such they were for drunkardsBut I daresay you will have already guessedIt would under other circumstanceshave had no difficulty in entering my headAs it wasthere seemed a certain impediment of consciousness when any phenomena of that sort was concernedThese three figures were three AmericansThis seems very simpleI knowvery simpleThis was abstract facthoweverThis very simple and unabstruse fact trembled and lingered before completely entering into my consciousnessThe extreme rapidity of my mind in another sense in seeing all this factif verifiedmight signify to me may have been responsible for thatThen one of themon turning his headdisplays the familiar features of Taffanya Mississippi freind of mineI simultaneously recognized Blauenfeld and Mortonthe other two members of a trioA real triolike real twinsis rarer than one thinksIt is one of the strangest and closest of human relationshipsThis one was the remnant of a quartetI had met it first in ParisIn becomingfrom any three Americansthree of my friendsthey precipitated in a most startling way the vivid and full blooded hopeoptimismreinstatement of vitalitycontained in the possibilities wonderfully hidden in this meetingTwo steps brought me up with them and my cordiality almost exceeded theirs Whyif that doesn t beat everythingHow did you get here shouted Taffany Been here longHow do you like itWhat do you think of the town pressed Blauenfeld Where are you stayingHave you struck a good Hotel demanded MortonOptimismconsciousness of powerno wonder1 thoughtsurged out of themAhthe kindnessthe overwhelming kindnessI bathed voluptuously in this American greeting this real American greetingNothing naturalised about thatAt the same time I felt almost an awe at the thought of my friendsdangerous nationalityThese good fellows I knew and liked so well seemed for the moment to have some intermixture of the strangeness of Monsieur de ValmoreHoweverI measured with enthusiasm their egregious breadth of shoulderthe exorbitance of theirpants They could not be too Americanor American enoughfor meHad they appeared in a star and stripe swallow tail suitlike the cartoons of Uncle SamI should not have been satisfiedI felt rather like some Eastern potentate whohaving been continually defeated in battle by a neighbour because of the presence in the latter s army of half a dozen elephantssuddenly becomes possessed of a couple of dozen himselfThe amount of Americanism at my disposal now was overwhelmingTalk of super DreadnoughtsBut there is no such thing as a super AmericanIt can t be doneIt is one thing that can t be superedOr I felt like some chemist who gets a temporary monopoly of a rare and potent chemical substanceThe amount of pure unadulterated American stuff in my possession at present would neutralize the Americanism in Monsieur de Valmore in a brace of shakesand leave nothing but a scraggy little GasconI must have behaved rather oddly to my friendsAs a starving manunexpectedly presented with a shillingmight squeeze it tightly in his fist and run alongfor fear of its melting or escaping in some waytill he gets to the nearest cook shopso I cherished my three AmericansI was inclined to shelter them as though they were fragileto see they didn t get run overor expose themselves to the sunEach transatlantic quaintness of speech or gesture I received with a positive ovationAll thoughts of Corunua disappearedThe letters remained unpostedFirst of all I took my trio into a little café near the Post Officeand told them at once what was expected of them There s one of theboyshere I said OhAn American Morton asked seriously Wellhe deserves to beBut he began too late in lifeI thinkHe hails frrom the South of France and Americanism came to him as a revelation when youth had already pastHe repented tardily but sincerely of his misguided early nationalityBut his years spent as a Frenchman have left their markIn the meantimehe won t leave Englishmen aloneHe persecutes themapparentlywherever he finds themHe mustn t do that Taffany said with resolution WhynoI guess he musn t said Blauenfeld I knew you d say that I continued It s a rank abuse of authority and I was sure would be regretted at headquartersNow if you could only be presentunseenand witness how Ifor instanceam oppressed by this fanatic fellow citizen of yoursand if you could then issue forthand reprove himand tell him not to do it againI should be much obliged I m very sorry you should have to complainMrPine of treatment of that sort but what sort is itanyway I gave a lurid picture of my tribulationsto the scandal and indignation of my friendsThey at once placed themselvesand laughinglytheir Americanism any quantity of that mixture in their organisms at my disposalI considered it of the first importance that Monsieur de Val more should not get wind of what had happenedI took my three Americans cautiously out of the caféand as their hotel was near the station and not near the enemy s hauntsI encouraged their going back to itI also supposed that they would wish to make some toilet for the eveningand relied on their good sense to put on their baggiest trousers I dreamed of even baggier ones than they had on I knew thatunlike other nationsthe smarter an American s clothesthe more American they areMy army was in excellent formA rollicking good humour prevailedI kept them out of the way till nightfall and then after an early dinnerby a circuitous routeapproached the café PelayoThe Little Review I have not yet described my forcesI will adopt the unusual method of describing what was in their pocketsWhat is in a man s pockets is generally the outposts of his souland being only a tenth of an inch below the surface and infinitely more accessible than the soulI wonder that this compromise has never been hit upon in the history of exuberant and creative fictionI feel it would have suited the clothes of DickenscharactersThe contents of a man s pockets is like a spiritual deposit just beneath the surfaceor like bubbles from the deep well beneathOf course it will be only guessworkBut had I pretended to deeper insight it would be more so stillThe soil of Taffanyif I may so describe his clothingwas of a rich uniformbrown earthern appearancewith little veinslike the trace of some attenuated mineral running down itHis trouser pockets contained a couple of knivesa revolvera reckless mass of coin and some stringThe form of these knives denoted at once a fierce and inventive natureOne of them was not unlike abowieknifealthough it hadI thinknever been used for slaughterNo doubt inwhittlinga stick or paring his nails its appearance in his hand helped to the sensation of some blood thirsty actThe other knife when opened was a little hedgehog of stumpy bladesskewerspoking and prodding implements and corkscrewsWith this Taffany went through life prying open obstinate fruit tinspulling out corksmanufacturing pipesetcThe mass of moneysilver and copperaccounted somewhat for the richness of the soil in which it layas I have mentionedalthough this may not tally with any known geology alsoalong with the notes in the pockets aboveacted as fuel to impel Taffany over wide lapses of land and seaBy its disposition and neighbourhood it should belong to a man who regarded it rather as water to drawand in large quantitiesoftenaccording to the needs of life a sober life and for whom it had none of the attributes of wine or drugsnot even of beerJust homely waterof which there must be muchThe revolver was the only voice one would hear of the thoroughly roused TaffanyThis was the practical areaAs one mounted higher in this mountainous soil one came to the sentimental and intellectual tracts about the breastletters from his familypaper cuttings and so onBlauenfeld had in his coat pocket theDigit of the Moon So had Morton in hisThis book had been recommended to them by an American girl in a Paris studioThey had very seriously and gratefully made a note of itafter several weeks had procured it and were now reading it assidiouslyBlauenfeld s money was in strata coppersilveretcHe had more than Taffanybut paid more attention to itA rich black enveloped himMorton possessed a little seraglio of photographs of ladies that his undecided and catholic fancy had made him indule inThey all had great sexual charmtactfully displayedHe had his favorite photographof courseIt was the least tactfulmerelyI am afraidThen there was a card casea dictionarya mapwith much other matterIn factwhat was found in Morton s pockets was of such a complicated nature that it would be difficult to classify itHis soulas it happenedwas momentarily nearer the surface than in the case of his companionsThat these three men were my willing instruments needs no explanationas we were excellent comradesA sense of humour is the chief and most inalienable right of the American citizenIt goes always hand in hand with LibertyThese three good fellows went campaigning with meeven put themselves under my orderswith enthusiasmThey were in sympathy with my causewhich was that of humourWe were all four Soldiers of HumourButas it was my magnificent discovery and patent quarrelit was my battleand they willingly marched at my heelsas I should have done at theirs had it been the other way aboutThe natural enemy of the Soldier of Humourand against whom he carries on uproariousendless and delighted warfareis the man or the multitude bereft of that astonishing senseThis wonderful warriorto make the battle more exquisite will even feign a dullnessand falling away from the keennessof that senseIn my historic struggle with Monsieur de Valmoresometimes I pretended to go down into the headlong cockpit of his unconsciousnessand grappled with him on equal termsBut no doubt such encounters nowadays are mostly bloodlessI am sure that many of the soldiers and adventurers of the Middle Ages were really Soldiers of Humourunrecognised and unclassifiedI know that many a duel has been fought in this solemn causeA man of this temper and category willperhaps carefullyentreteniror cherish a wide circle of accessible enemies that his sword may not rustAny other quarrel may be patched upBut what can be described as a quarrel of humour divides men for everIt is usually conceded that Humour is the discovery of the Anglo Saxon raceI felt this racial solidarity as I was marching on the Café PelayoI revised my plan of actionTaffany and his two friends were to enter the caféestablish themselves autocratically therebecome acquainted with Monsieur de Valmore almost certainly the latter The Little Review would at once approach his fellow citizensand then I was to put in an appearanceThe Café was entered to the strains ofThere is a tavern in the townin the townsung by my three alliesI imagined the glow of national pride and delighted recognition that would invade Monsieur de Valmore on hearing this airApart from the sentimental reason its use as a kind of battle song was the practical one that this noisy entrancewould at once attract my enemy s attentionI awaited events at a neighbouring caféTen minutes passedand I knew that my friends hadlocatedMonsieur de Valmoreeven if they had not begun operationsElse they would have returned to my place of waitingI wallowed naively in a superb coolness and indifferenceas a man who has set some machinery goingwhich can now run by itselfturns nonchalantly awaypaying no more attention to itI felt strongly the stage analogyI became rather conscious of my appearanceI must awaitmy cuebut was sure of my receptionFrom time to time I glanced idly down the roadand at last saw Blauenfeld making towards mehis usual American swing of the body complicated by rhythmical upheavals of mirth into trampling and stumblings and slappings of his thigh somewhere in the folds of his clothesI paid for my coffee while he was coming upand then turned to him All readyYepwe ve got him fineCome and have a look at himDid he carry out his part of the programme according to my arrangementsWhyyesWe went right inand all three spotted him at the same timeTaffany manoeuvred in the vicinityand Morty and me coquetted round in his pro pinquityWe could see his eyes beginning to stick out of his headand his mouth wateringAt last he could hold himself in no longerwe came together with a hiss and splutter of joyHe called up a tray full of drinksto take the rawness off our meetingHe can t have seen an American for monthsHe just gobbled us upThere ain t nothing left of TaffanyHe s made us promise to go to his Ho tel tonight I approached the lurid stronghold of citizenshipwith its pretentious palmy terracemy mouth a little drawn and pinchedeyebrows raisedlike a fastidious expert called in somewhere to decide a debatable pointThis figure dictated my manner nowI entered the swing doors and looked round in a cold and business like wayThe Little Review as a doctor would in saying loftily Where is the patient The patient was there right enoughsurrounded by the nurses I had sentThere sat Monsieur de Valmore in as defenceless a state of beautitude as possibleHe stared at me with an incredulous grin at firstI believe that in this moment of exquisite plenitude of life he would have been willing to extend to me a temporary pardon a passe partout to his café for the eveningI approached him with impassive professional rapiditymy eye fixed on himthe physician analogyalready making my diagnosisI was so carried away by this that I almost began things by asking him to put out his tongueInstead I sat down carefully in front of him and examined him in silenceIn the midst of an enervating debauchor barely convalescent from a bad illnessconfronted by his mortalest enemyno man could have looked more blankBut as such a man might turn to his boon companions or to his nurse or attendants for helpso Monsieur de Valmore turned with a characteristic blank childish appeal to TaffanyPerhaps he was shy or diffident of taking up actively his great rolewhen more truly great actors were presentWould not divine American speakor thunderthrough themat this intruder I guess you don t know each othersaid Taffany SayMrde Valmorehere s a friend of mineMrArthur Pine My enemy pulled himself together as though the different parts of his body all wanted to leap away in different directionsand hewith huge effortwere preventing such disintegrationAn attempt at a bow appeared as a chaotic movement of various limbs and organsThe bow had met other movements on the wayand never became a bow at allAn extraordinary confusion beset his bodyThe beginning fo a score of actions ran over it blindly and disappeared Guess Mrde Valmore ain t quite comfortable in that chairMortyGive him yours And in this chaotic and unusual state he was hustled from one chair to the otherlike a sack of mildly expostulating potatoesHis racial instinct was undergoing the severest revolution it has yet knownIt was somewhat in the state of a South American Republic which has had three Presidents and an Emperor in a fortnight and is just electing a provisional DictatorIt was as though an incarnation of sacred America herself had commanded him to take me to his bosomAndas the scope of my victory dawned upon himhis personal mortification assumed the proportions of a national calamityFor the first time since the sealing of his citizenship he felt that he was only a Frenchman from the Middi hardly as near an Americanin point of factas even an Englishman isThe soldier of Humour is chivalrousthough implacableI merely drank a bottle of champagne at his expensemade Don Pedro and his orchestra perform three extrasall made up of the most intensely national English light comedy musicsuch as San Toy and Our Miss GibbsTaffanyfor whom Monsieur de Valmore entertained the maximum of respect held him solemnly for some time with a detailed and fabulous enumeration of my virtuesBefore long I withdrew with my forces to riot in barbarous triumph elsewhere for the rest of the eveningDuring the next two days I on several occasions visited the battlefieldbut Monsieur de Valmore had vanishedHis disappearance alone would have been sufficient to tell me that my visit to Spain was terminatedAnd in fact two days later I left Pontaissandra with the Americansparting with them at Tuy and myself continuing on the LeonSan Sebastian route back to France and eventually to ParisI was taking away with me a good deal of Spanishbut in a rather battered or at least fragmentary conditionI interpret Spanish nowamong other thingsbut with a hesitating lack of finish that shows traces of the stress of this time I have just describedArrived at BayonneI left the railway station with a momentarily increasing premonitionIt was already night timeStepping rapidly across the squareI hurried down the hall way of the Fonda del Mundoand turning brusquely and directly into the dining room of the Inn gazed round me almost shocked not to find what I had half expectedI sat downpilotting myself alertly and safely through the menuAlthough Monsieur de Valmore had not been there to greet meas good or better than his presence seemed to be attending me on my withdrawel from SpainI still heard in this naked little roomas the wash of the sea in a shellthe echo of the first whisperings of his weird displeasureNext day I arrived in Parismy Spanish nightmare shuffled off long before I reached that hum drum spotThe Little Review THOUGHTS FROM A COUNTRY VICARAGEI PRINT the following letteror rather part of a letternot because I wish to commit either myself or The Little Review to the opinions therein expressedWe are not a propagandist organand the religion of the multitude is not our affairIt is however our affair to take note of what things are thought by our contemporariesand thus to leave as nearly as possible a true record of our timeNeither is the letter itself propagandaIt was written to a friendas the Review is mentioned the letter was shown to meI now print it with its author s permissionHe is the vicar of a country parish in Englanda vicar highly efficient and deeply respected by his parishionersDespite Remy de Gourmont sIls comprennent cela en théologieI think there is very little real toleration in Americawhich being so the reader may regard this communication as a sign of the times I think the churches have little influenceand that little is decliningit will decline more as education spreadsBut the clergy are still aggressive and mischievousand they are exploiting the present distressalthough their theology has brought them into a false and absurd positionOf course entire pacifism and non resistance are the only logical deduction from the principles of Jesusso far as we have any record of anything he saidbut the churches have never been able to accept these principlesfacts have always been too strong for themAnd only a few fanatics dare enunciate them nowThe majority of the clergy have to talk the twaddle which they circulate about reprisalsand to resist the application of military service to themselvesFor all these follies they will pay dearly in the endbutin the meanwhilepacifists and Sabbatarian fanatics are doing harm I suppose the majority of people are neither brave nor logical enough to see that Christianity is not compatible with things as they areIn factit is a doctrine of deathand the more thoroughly it is appliedthe more destructive it becomesIf the sermon on the mount were carried out it would lead mankind through idlenessigmoranceand barbarism to extinctionI don t know whether the latter would BE any loss to the universebut the journey would BE unpleasant for US The old testament begins with a cosmology which we know to be untrueThe new testament begins by saying that the Kingdom of Heaven is at handwhich two thousand years have disprovedEven this does not convince a fanaticor confute a theologianThe only justification for the sermon on the mount is the speaker s belief that the existing order was to disappear at onceand a new society was to be inauguratedin which the ideal would displace the realAs the premise was unsoundthe conclusion is erroneousor worse These errors took a very large part in wrecking civilizationfifteen centuries agoandso far as they were able to prevail they made a hell of Europe for over a thousand yearsThe same principles would hand us over again to the same barbariansif they were as influential now as they were in the fifth centurywhich fortunately they are notbut they are still mischievous and prevalent enoughso I hope Pound and his allies will go for them with their sharpest weaponsthough I think only clubs and stones are effective against the density of theologians satire or sensealascan Sporus feel The rest of the letter is concerned with English politicsI think there is a slight misunderstanding of The Little Review implied in the last expression of desireWe are not out either to support or destroy any religionWe stand simply for the free right of expressionA certain view is excellently and pithily put in this letterIn so far as repressive measuresmeasures against the freedom of literary expression have proceededand often proceedfrom remnants and superstitions of religionin just so far would we stand against the erroneous opinion than any given religion is ubiquitous or undoubtedor subject to all men s approvalThe question whether the fall of the Roman Empire was due to Christianityor the spread of Christianity due to the fall of the Empire and the ensuing ignorance must be referred to the research of historiansI believe I have somewhere expressed the latter viewor ascribed it to some character in a dialoguebut I amor he issubject to correctionIt is significant that the letter quoted comes from a churchman and not from an

ofLustra This wordlustrameans one of two thingseither expiatory sacrifices or morassesEzra Pound is too absolutely degraded to offer sacrificesmuch less expiatory onestherefore we must be content to consider the book a collection of morassesquicksandsBogs the poems certainly areThere is an enormous charm about some of themand one is in jeopardy of being lured to tread out upon themand only when the hungry mud sucks a shoe off and one gets a stocking slimyrealize one s delusionThey have the appearance of poetrythe lines are all split upand now and again there is a really delightful metaphorto give the devil his dueThis it is which has induced people out upon themand has given Ezra s corrupting influence a wide scopeAs a rule these poems are not poemsbeauty is never flippant Leonard Cline Who is this man in Detroit who thinks he can limit beautyIf it s a sin tomake beauty flippant isn t it a minor sin compared to limiting beautyMrCline is akin to all that brood who have lines inside of

whichwan though it beis to be treasured like a full goatskin in the desertHe aloneof the few bards with whose work I am acquaintedpreserves an exquisite balance in the current of his own emotionsOf material things he is never seriousof passions he treats with a sharp tongue held in his cheekOf ideasthoughtsmeditationshe is drolly cynicaleven when they are the product of his own enfevered fancyAnd of colorwherever he finds ithe is properly rapturousNothing is too small to receive the salaam of an adjectiveNothing too unimportant to receive the touch of his illuminating phrases Ben Hechtin The Chicago Daily NewsEzra Pound is the bite of the champagneIt is not the best part of the winebut the most importantHe is the translator essentially unfaithfulHis active intelligence goes beyond mere bookish imitationWhen he brings the old wine 53 The Little Review out of the bottlethe atmosphere in which he liveshis quick mindnaturally biting in its methodsin a wordthe ardent quality of his whole personalityare fused in the old wineand make this wittydelicateoften sarcastic effervescenceThe wine itselfhowevera l most disowns this sparklePound does not interfere with the genius of foreign workbut whatever intelligence and liberty of thoughtthe destructive spiritand imagination can add to a work of artthat Pound addsIf the name of Pound comes into all discussions on art it is bebecause he hasto an unusual degreecertain qualitiesand that at least two of them are very apparent and greatly appreciatedHe is free and without rhetoric no one more soHis vision is directhe does not use the imagebut shows the things themselves with powerThis is indeed a quality of the ImagistesHis inde pendence comes from the fact that he has dug into the past with a keener mindand more profoundly than is necessary for ordinary cultureThe number of influences he has passed under have also freed himand he has made his departure from the known with rare audacity The poet is a sceptic madly in lovewho wants in spite of everything to create his dreamUp to now Pound has beaten out a path for his creationshe uproots weeds of aesthetics and moralshe makes one look in frontnot to the side or through a veil of passive acceptanceEverywhere his poems incite man to existto profess a becoming egotismwithout which there can be no real altruismOne must believe in one s own existenceand

his article to Contemporary Versementioning no other poetry magazine by nameOf this magazine he saysin part One periodicalwhich comes from Philadelphiais wholly given to the publication of poetry in its different formsA copy of this magazine Contemporary Verse has attracted us by the variety and quality of its contributionsWhat is most remarkable is that poems are all goodand several are of the highest and freshest beautyOne of the poems in this numberand we have said that there is a good deal else that is goodwould be enough in itself to justify the charming enterpriseWe have of course no means of knowing how the enterprise has prosperedbut we are sure it ought to prosper at fifteen cents a copyand if it probably does not enrich its proprietors or contributors we are sure it serves their higher needs better than the more miscellaneous magazineswhich reserve for verse such holes and corners of space as their prose leaves unfilled HERE IS WHAT OTHER CRITICS SAY ABOUT CONTEMPORARY
