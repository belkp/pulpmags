letter bring  such darkness down With this She dallied with your love too long And this It is the word of all the town Corinna has no soul for all her song  Martha Entering with flowers O sir I bring you  flaming bergamot And early asters for your window sill And where I found them Now you ll guess it not I visited the garden on the hill And gathered till my arms could hold no more  David The garden of the little silent house Martha The city lured her from her viny door But see the flowers have stayed  David They seem to drowse And dream of one they lost a paler blown How fares the house upon the hill  Martha The blinds Are fast of late and all are intergrown    With weedy havoc tossed by searching winds David How somber suddenly the sky A shower  Is in the air Martha I ll light the lamps David Not yet  Leave me the beauty of the twilit hour Martha Hear the wind rising How the moorings  fret More than a shower is on its way through space I would not be aboard of yonder barque  She goes out  David Corinna Now may I recall her face It is my light to think by in the dark Yes all my years of study all the will Tenacious to achieve the tempered strife The victories attained through patient skill Lie at the door of one dear human life And yet the letter  Often have I read How love relumes the flowers and the trees True For my world is newly garmented Rewards seem slight and slighter penalties Daily companionship is more and more To make one little good more viable To lift one load is worth the heart s outpour And she she has made all things wonderful And yet the letter  O to break a spell    The Silent House  Wherein the stars are crumbling unto dust There never was a hope I know it well And struggle on and love because I must Never a hope Shall ever any scheme Her silence or alarm of written word Or voiced asseveration shake my dream She loves me By love s anguish I have heard We two from our soul towers across a vale Are calling each to each alert aware Shall one of us one day the other hail And no reply be borne upon the air Corinna come to light my heart s dim place O come to me Beloved and Besought O er grief o er gladness even o er death apace For I could greet your phantom so it brought Love s own reality  A song of hers Seems striving hither a faint villanelle Half smothered by the gale s mad roisterers She used to sing it in the bracken dell Here is the rain against the window beating In heavy drops that presage wilder storm The lake is lost within a lurid sheeting The house upon the hill has changed its form The melancholy pine trees weep in rocking And what s that clamor at the outer door Martha O Martha Somebody is knocking Calling Martha Re entering You hear the rills that down the gutters roar David And are you deaf The door go open it This is no night to leave a man outside  Martha Muttering and going toward the door And  is it I am growing deaf a bit And blind a bit with other ill betide Well I can see to thread a needle still And I can hear the ticking of the clock And I can fetch a basket from the mill But hallow me if ever I heard knock  She throws the door open David starts up and rushes forward with outstretched arms  David Corinna You Corinna Drenched and cold At last at last But how in all the rain Martha  Martha stands motionless unseeing  Good Martha you are growing old Draw fast the shades shut out the hurricane Here take the dripping cloak from out the room Bring cordial from the purple damson pressed And light the lamps the candles fire the gloom Why stand you gaping See you not the guest  Martha I opened wide the door unto the storm But never heard I step upon the sill All the black night let in no living form I see no guest Look hard as e er I will I see none here but you and my poor self    The Silent House  David The room that was my mother s room prepare Spread out warm garments on the oaken shelf Her gown the little shawl she used to wear  Martha wide eyed bewildered lights the lamps and candles and goes out raising her hands  Corinna The moments I may tarry fade and press Something impelled me hither some clear flame They said I had no soul O David yes They said I had no soul And so I came I have been singing singing all the way O singing ever since the darkness grew And I grew chill and followed the small ray Lean close and let my longing rest in you  David Dear balm of light I never thought to win From out the pallid hours for ever throbbing How did you know the sorrow I was in  Corinna A flock of leaves came sobbing sobbing sobbing  David O now 1 hold you fast my love my own My festival upleaping from an ember But timid child how could you come alone Across the pathless woods  Corinna Do you remember Over the summer lake one starry stilly Sweet night when you and I were drifting dear I frighted at the shadow of a lily It is all strange but now I have no fear    David Your eyes are weary drooping Sleep then  sleep Corinna I must go over to the silent house David The dwelling stands forsaken up the steep  With never beast nor human to arouse Corinna Soon will the windows gleam with many lamps  Hark heavy wheels are toiling to the north David I will go with you where the darkness ramps Corinna Strong arms are in the storm to bear me  forth David Not in these garments dripping as the trees Not in these clinging shadows  Corinna Ah good night Dear love dear love I must go forth in these Tomorrow you shall see me all in white  Agnes Lee    THE ORACLE  To the New Telescope on Mt Wilson  Of old sat one at Delphi brooding o er The fretful earth ironically wise Veiling her prescience in dark replies She shaped the fates of men with mystic lore The oracle is silent now No more Fate parts the cloud that round omniscience lies But thou O Seer dost tease our wild surmise With portents passing all the wealth of yore For thou shalt spell the very thoughts of God Before thy boundless vision world on world Shall multiply in glit ring sequence far And all the little ways which men have trod Shall be as nothing by His star dust whirled Into the making of a single star  A GARGOYLE ON NOTRE DAME  With angel s wings and brutish human form Weathered with centuries of sun and storm He crouches yonder on the gallery wall Monstrous superb indifferent cynical And all the pulse of Paris cannot stir Her one immutable philosopher  Edmund Kemper Broadus    SANTA BARBARA BEACH  Now while the sunset offers Shall we not take our own The gems the blazing coffers The seas the shores the throne  The sky ships radiant masted Move out bear low our way Oh Life was dark while it lasted Now for enduring day  Now with the world far under To draw up drowning men And show them lands of wonder Where they may build again  There earthly sorrow falters There longing has its wage There gleam the ivory altars Of our lost pilgrimage  Swift flame then shipwrecks only Beach in the ruined light Above them reach up lonely The headlands of the night  A hurt bird cries and flutters Her dabbled breast of brown The western wall unshutters To fling one last rose down    Maternity  A rose a wild light after  And life calls through the years Who dreams my fountains laughter Shall feed my wells with tears  Ridgely Torrence  MATERNITY  One wept whose only babe was dead New born ten years ago Weep not he is in bliss they said She answered Even so  Ten years ago was born in pain A child not now forlorn But oh ten years ago in vain A mother a mother was born  Alice Meynell    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PROFITS  Yes stars were with me formerly I also knew the wind and sea And hill tops had my feet by heart Their shagged heights would sting and start When I came leaping on their backs I knew the earth s queer crooked cracks Where hidden waters weave a low  And druid chant of joy and woe But stars were with me most of all I heard them flame and break and fall Their excellent array their free Encounter with Eternity I learned And it was good to know That where God walked I too might go Now all these things are passed For I Grow very old and glad to die What did they profit me say you These distant bloodless things I knew Profit What profit hath the sea Of her deep throated threnody What profit hath the sun who stands Staring on space with idle hands And what should God Himself acquire From all the aeons blood and fire My profit is as theirs to be Made proof against mortality    Poems Fannie Stearns Davis  To know that I have companied With all that shines and lives amid So much the years sift through their hands Most mortal windy worthless sands  This day I have great peace With me Shall stars abide eternally  TWO SONGS OF CONN THE FOOL  MOON FOLLY  I will go up the mountain after the Moon She is caught in a dead fir tree Like a great pale apple of silver and pearl Like a great pale apple is she  I will leap and will clasp her in quick cold hands And carry her home in my sack I will set her down safe on the oaken bench That stands at the chimney back And then I will sit by the fire all night And sit by the fire all day I will gnaw at the Moon to my heart s delight Till I gnaw her slowly away  And while I grow mad with the Moon s cold taste The World may beat on my door Crying Come out and crying Make haste And give us the Moon once more But I will not answer them ever at all    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I will laugh as I count and hide The great black beautiful seeds of the Moon In a flower pot deep and wide Then I will lie down and go fast asleep Drunken with flame and aswoon But the seeds will sprout and the seeds will leap The subtle swift seeds of the Moon  And some day all of the world that beats And cries at my door shall see A thousand moon leaves sprout from my thatch On a marvellous white Moon tree Then each shall have moons to his heart s desire Apples of silver and pearl Apples of orange and copper fire Setting his five wits aswirl And then they will thank me who mock me now Wanting the Moon is he Oh I m off to the mountain after the Moon Ere she falls from the dead fir tree  WARNING  You must do nothing false Or cruel lipped or low For I am Conn the Fool And Conn the Fool will know    Poems Fannie Stearns Davis  I went by the door When Patrick Joyce looked out He did not wish for me Or any one about He thought I did not see The fat bag in his hand But Conn heard clinking gold And Conn could understand I went by the door Where Michael Kane lay dead I saw his Mary tie A red shawl round her head I saw a dark man lean Across her garden wall They did not know that Conn Walked by at late dusk fall You must not scold or lie Or hate or steal or kill For I shall tell the wind That leaps along the hill And he will tell the stars That sing and never lie And they will shout your sin In God s face bye and bye And God will not forget For all He loves you so He made me Conn the Fool And bade me always know    STORM DANCE  The water came up with a roar The water came up to me There was a wave with tusks of a boar And he gnashed his tusks on me I leaned I leapt and was free He snarled and struggled and fled Foaming and blind he turned to the sea And his brothers trampled him dead  The water came up with a shriek The water came up to me There was a wave with a woman s cheek And she shuddered and clung to me I crouched I cast her away She cursed me and swooned and died Her green hair tangled like sea weed lay Tossed out on the tearing tide  Challenge and chase me Storm Harry and hate me Wave Wild as the wind is my heart but warm Sudden and merry and brave For the water comes up with a shout The water comes up to me And oh but I laugh laugh out And the great gulls laugh and the sea  Fannie Stearns Davis    Poems Samuel McCoy  DIRGE FOR A DEAD ADMIRAL  What woman but would be Rid of thy mastery Thou bully of the sea  No more the gray sea s breast Need answer thy behest No more thy sullen gun Shall greet the risen sun Where the great dreadnaughts ride The breast of thy cold bride Thou hast fulfilled thy fate Need trade no more with hate  Nay but I celebrate Thy long to be lorn mate Thy mistress and her state Thy lady sea s lorn state She hath her empery Not only over thee But o er our misery  Hark doth she mourn for thee  Nay what hath she of grief She knoweth not the leaf That on her bosom falls Thou last of admirals    Under the winter moon She singeth that fierce tune Her immemorial rune Knoweth not late or soon Careth not Any jot For her withholden boon To all thy spirit s pleas For infinite surcease  If on this winter night O thou great admiral That in thy sombre pall Liest upon the land Thy soul should take his flight And leave the frozen sand And yearn above the surge Think st thou that any dirge Grief inarticulate From thy bereaved mate Would answer to thy soul Where the waste waters roll  Nay thou hast need of none Thy long love watch is done    Poems Samuel McCoy  SPRING SONG  Early some morning in May time I shall awaken When the breeze blowing in at the window Shall bathe me With the delicate scents Of the blossoms of apples Filling my room with their coolness And beauty and fragrance As of old as of old When your spirit dwelt with me My heart shall be pure As the heart that you gave me  A SWEETHEART THOMPSON STREET  Queen of all streets Fifth Avenue Stretches her slender limbs From the great Arch of Triumph on On where the distance dims The splendors of her jewelled robes Her granite draperies The magic sunset smitten walls That veil her marble knees For ninety squares she lies a queen  Superb bare unashamed Yielding her beauty scornfully To worshippers unnamed    But at her feet her sister glows A daughter of the South Squalid immeasurably mean But oh her hot sweet mouth  My Thompson Street a Tuscan girl Hot with life s wildest blood Her black shawl on her black black hair Her brown feet stained with mud  A scarlet blossom at her lips A new babe at her breast A singer at a wine shop door Her lover unconfessed  Listen a hurdy gurdy plays Now alien melodies She smiles she cannot quite forget The mother over seas  But she no less is mine alone Mine mine Who may I be Have I betrayed her from her home I am called Liberty  THE OFF SHORE WIND  The skies are sown with stars tonight The sea is sown with light The hollows of the heaving floor Gleam deep with light once more The racing ebb tide flashes past And seeks the vacant vast    Poems Samuel McCoy  A wind steals from a world asleep And walks the restless deep  It walks the deep in ecstasy It lives and loves to free Its spirit to the silent night And breathes deep in delight Above the sea that knows no coast Beneath the starry host The wind walks like the souls of men Who walk with God again  The souls of men who walk with God With faith s firm sandals shod A lambent passion body free Fain for eternity O spirit born of human sighs Set loose twixt sea and skies Be thou an Angel of mankind Thou night unfettered wind  Bear thou the dreams of weary earth Bear thou Tomorrow s birth Take all our longings up to Him Until His stars grow dim A moving anchorage of prayer Thou cool and healing air Heading off shore till shoreless dawn Breaks fair and night is gone  Samuel McCoy    THE HILL FLOWERS  I will lift up mine eyes to the hills  I  Moving through the dew moving through the dew Ere I waken in the city Life thy dawn makes all  things new And up a fir clad glen far from all the haunts of men Up a glen among the mountains oh my feet are wings  again  Moving through the dew moving through the dew O mountains of my boyhood I come again to you By the little path I know with the sea far below And above the great cloud galleons with their sails  of rose and snow  As of old when all was young and the earth a song unsung And the heather through the crimson dawn its Eden incense flung From the mountain heights of joy for a careless hearted boy And the lavrocks rose like fountain sprays of bliss that ne er could cloy  From their little beds of bloom from the golden gorse and broom The Hill Flowers  With a song to God the Giver o er that waste of  wild perfume Blowing from height to height in a glory of great light While the cottage clustered valleys held the lilac last of  night  So when dawn is in the skies in a dream a dream I rise And I follow my lost boyhood to the heights of Paradise Life thy dawn makes all things new Hills of Youth I  come to you Moving through the dew moving through the dew  II  Moving through the dew moving through the dew Floats a brother s face to meet me Is it you Is it you For the night I leave behind keeps these dazzled eyes  still blind But oh the little hill flowers their scent is wise and kind  And I shall not lose the way from the darkness to the day While dust can cling as their scent clings to memory  for aye And the least link in the chain can recall the whole again And heaven at last resume its far flung harvests grain by  grain    To the hill flowers clings my dust and tho eyeless Death  may thrust All else into the darkness in their heaven I put my trust And a dawn shall bid me climb to the little spread of  thyme Where first I heard the ripple of the fountain heads of rhyme  And a fir wood that I know from dawn to sunset glow Shall whisper to a lonely sea that swings far far below Death thy dawn makes all things new Hills of Youth  I come to you Moving through the dew moving through the dew  Alfred Noyes   EDITORIAL COMMENT  THE SERVIAN EPIC  POETRY as the inspiration of the Balkan  war was the theme of a recent talk given  by Madame Slavko Grouitch before the Fri  ay Club in Chicago and elsewhere during  her brief sojourn in her native country  Madame Grouitch was a student at the American School of Archaeology in Athens when she married the young Servian diplomat who now represents his nation in London  According to the speaker the Servian national songs have kept alive the heroic spirit of the people during more than four centuries of Turkish oppression Through them each generation of the illiterate peasantry has fought once more the ancient wars and followed once more the ancient leaders even to the final tragedy of the battle of Kossovo where in 1377 they made their last brave stand against the Mohammedan invader Whenever a few people assemble for a festival some local bard perhaps an old shepherd or soldier a blind beggar or reformed brigand will chant the old songs to the monotonous music of the gusle while the people dance the Koto  There are thousands of songs in the Servian epic  says Mme Grouitch and each has many variants    according to whether it is sung in Bosnia Herzegovina Montenegro Dalmatia Servia Bulgaria or Macedonia for all these political divisions are peopled by the Servian race descended from the heroes whose deeds are the theme of such unwearied narration The bard is called the Guslar from his one stringed instrument whose melancholy cadence a sighing forth of sound affects the emotions and increases the pathos of the words For the story is usually sad even when it proclaims the triumph of great deeds  These songs invariably begin Once it was so now it is told And they as invariably end From me the song from God health to you A number of poems were read from Mme Mijatovich s rather uninspired translation of the Kossovo series published in London in 1881 Extreme simplicity and vividness characterize the old epic which follows the hopeless struggle of the noble Czar Lazar against the foe without and suspicions dissensions blunders even treacheries within Certain characters stand out with the uncompromising exactness of some biblical story the Czar himself his over zealous Vojvode Milosh Obilich whose murder of Sultan Murad precipitated the disaster and certain haughty and passionate women like the Empress Militza and her two daughters Also Marko the King s son whose half mythical figure is of the race of Achilles    The Servian Epic  There was one thing said Mme Grouitch which the Turk could not take away from the Serb the heavenly gift of poetry that continued to dwell hidden in the breast of the southern Slav His body was enslaved but his soul was not his physical life was oppressed but his spiritual being remained free In the eighteenth century Europe re discovered the Servian national poetry and became conscious that the race survived as well as its ideals Then Serb and Bulgar again appeared in current history and began to retrace the ancient boundaries  All the conferences of all the powers can never diminish the hopes nor eclipse the glory of the Serb race in the minds of the Balkan peoples because the Guslar who is their supreme national leader is forever telling them of that glory and urging them to concerted action against all outside foes It was the Guslar who led the Montenegrin Serbs from one heroic victory to another so that their war annals as Gladstone said are more glorious than those of all the rest of the world It was the Guslar who inspired Kara George and his heroic band of Servian peasants to keep up their battle until free Servia was born  Amid the roar of cannon at Lule Burgas and Monastir I could hear the mighty voice of the Guslar reminding Serb and Bulgar that their fight was for the honored cross and golden liberty And they obeyed because it was the voice of their nation It is this irre    sistible national spirit which leads their armies and beside it the spirit of German training behind the Turk is a lifeless shadow The Ottoman power in Europe is in ruins now a wreck in the path of a national earthquake which the Guslar has prophesied for five hundred years The Guslar has done his duty and he stands today in a blaze of glory at the head of the united and victorious nations of the Balkans  The speaker told of an impressive ceremony at the Servian legation in London Young Servians recalled home for military service last autumn met there on the eve of departure Wine being served the minister and his young patriots rose with lifted glasses and chanted the ancient summons of Czar Lazar to his people  Whoever born of Serbian blood or kin Cornea not to fight the Turk on Kossovo To him be never son or daughter born No child to heir his lands or bear his name For him no grape grow red no corn grow white In his hands nothing prosper  May he live  Alone unloved and die unmourned alone  H M  IMAGISME  Some curiosity has been aroused concerning Imagisme and as I was unable to find anything definite about it in print I sought out an Itnagiste with intent to discover  Editor s Note In response to many requests for information regarding Imagism and the Imagistes we publish this note by Mr Flint supplementing it with further exemplification by Mr Pound It will be seen from these that Imagismis not necessarily associated with Hellenic subjects or with vers libre as a prescribed form    Imagisme  whether the group itself knew anything about the movement I gleaned these facts  The Imagistes admitted that they were contemporaries of the Post Impressionists and the Futurists but they had nothing in common with these schools They had not published a manifesto They were not a revolutionary school their only endeavor was to write in accordance with the best tradition as they found it in the best writers of all time in Sappho Catullus Villon They seemed to be absolutely intolerant of all poetry that was not written in such endeavor ignorance of the best tradition forming no excuse They had a few rules drawn up for their own satisfaction only and they had not published them They were  1 Direct treatment of the thing whether subjective or objective 2 To use absolutely no word that did not contribute to the presentation 3 As regarding rhythm to compose in sequence of the musical phrase not in sequence of a metronome  By these standards they judged all poetry and found most of it wanting They held also a certain Doctrine of the Image which they had not committed to writing they said that it did not concern the public and would provoke useless discussion  The devices whereby they persuaded approaching poetasters to attend their instruction were  1 They showed him his own thought already    splendidly expressed in some classic and the school musters altogether a most formidable erudition  2 They re wrote his verses before his eyes using about ten words to his fifty Even their opponents admit of them ruefully At least they do keep bad poets from writing  I found among them an earnestness that is amazing to one accustomed to the usual London air of poetic dilettantism They consider that Art is all science all religion philosophy and metaphysic It is true that snobisme may be urged against them but it is at least snobisme in its most dynamic form with a great deal of sound sense and energy behind it and they are stricter with themselves than with any outsider  F S Flint  A FEW DON T S BY AN IMAGISTE  An Image is that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time I use the term complex rather in the technical sense employed by the newer psychologists such as Hart though we might not agree absolutely in our application  It is the presentation of such a complex instantaneously which gives that sense of sudden liberation that sense of freedom from time limits and space limits that    A Few Don ts by an Imagiste  sense of sudden growth which we experience in the  presence of the greatest works of art  It is better to present one Image in a lifetime than  to produce voluminous works  All this however some may consider open to debate The immediate necessity is to tabulate A LIST OF DONT S for those beginning to write verses But I can not put all of them into Mosaic negative  To begin with consider the three rules recorded by Mr Flint not as dogma never consider anything as dogma but as the result of long contemplation which even if it is some one else s contemplation may be worth consideration  Pay no attention to the criticism of men who have never themselves written a notable work Consider the discrepancies between the actual writing of the Greek poets and dramatists and the theories of the Graeco Roman grammarians concocted to explain their metres  LANGUAGE Use no superflous word no adjective which does not reveal something Don t use such an expression as dim lands of peace It dulls the image It mixes an abstraction with the concrete It comes from the writer s not realizing that the natural object is always the adequate symbol Go in fear of abstractions Don t retell in mediocre verse what has already been done in good prose Don t think any intelligent person is going to be deceived when    you try to shirk all the difficulties of the unspeakably difficult art of good prose by chopping your composition into line lengths  What the expert is tired of today the public will be tired of tomorrow  Don t imagine that the art of poetry is any simpler than the art of music or that you can please the expert before you have spent at least as much effort on the art of verse as the average piano teacher spends on the art of music  Be influenced by as many great artists as you can but have the decency either to acknowledge the debt outright or to try to conceal it  Don t allow influence to mean merely that you mop up the particular decorative vocabulary of some one or two poets whom you happen to admire A Turkish war correspondent was recently caught red handed babbling in his dispatches of dove gray hills or else it was pearl pale I can not remember  Use either no ornament or good ornament  RHYTHM AND RHYME  Let the candidate fill his mind with the finest cadences he can discover preferably in a foreign language so that the meaning of the words may be less likely to divert his attention from the movement e g Saxon charms    A Few Dorit s by an Imagiste  Hebridean Folk Songs the verse of Dante and the lyrics of Shakespeare if he can dissociate the vocabulary from the cadence Let him dissect the lyrics of Goethe coldly into their component sound values syllables long and short stressed and unstressed into vowels and consonants  It is not necessary that a poem should rely on its music but if it does rely on its music that music must be such as will delight the expert  Let the neophyte know assonance and alliteration rhyme immediate and delayed simple and polyphonic as a musician would expect to know harmony and counterpoint and all the minutiae of his craft No time is too great to give to these matters or to any one of them even if the artist seldom have need of them  Don t imagine that a thing will go in verse just because it s too dull to go in prose  Don t be viewy leave that to the writers of pretty little philosophic essays Don t be descriptive remember that the painter can describe a landscape much better than you can and that he has to know a deal more about it  When Shakespeare talks of the Dawn in russet mantle clad he presents something which the painter does not present There is in this line of his nothing that one can call description he presents  Consider the way of the scientists rather than the way of an advertising agent for a new soap    The scientist does not expect to be acclaimed as a great scientist until he has discovered something He begins by learning what has been discovered already He goes from that point onward He does not bank on being a charming fellow personally He does not expect his friends to applaud the results of his freshman class work Freshmen in poetry are unfortunately not confined to a definite and recognizable class room They are all over the shop Is it any wonder the public is indifferent to poetry  Don t chop your stuff into separate iambs Don t make each line stop dead at the end and then begin every next line with a heave Let the beginning of the next line catch the rise of the rhythm wave unless you want a definite longish pause  In short behave as a musician a good musician when dealing with that phase of your art which has exact parallels in music The same laws govern and you are bound by no others  Naturally your rhythmic structure should not destroy the shape of your words or their natural sound or their meaning It is improbable that at the start you will be able to get a rhythm structure strong enough to affect them very much though you may fall a victim to all sorts of false stopping due to line ends and caesurae  The musician can rely on pitch and the volume of the orchestra You can not The term harmony is misapplied to poetry it refers to simultaneous sounds of    A Few Dont s by an Imagiste  different pitch There is however in the best verse a sort of residue of sound which remains in the ear of the hearer and acts more or less as an organ base A rhyme must have in it some slight element of surprise if it is to give pleasure it need not be bizarre or curious but it must be well used if used at all  Vide further Vildrac and Duhamel s notes on rhyme in Technique Poétique  That part of your poetry which strikes upon the imaginative eye of the reader will lose nothing by translation into a foreign tongue that which appeals to the ear can reach only those who take it in the original  Consider the definiteness of Dante s presentation as compared with Milton s rhetoric Read as much of Wordsworth as does not seem too unutterably dull  If you want the gist of the matter go to Sappho Catullus Villon Heine when he is in the vein Gautier when he is not too frigid or if you have not the tongues seek out the leisurely Chaucer Good prose will do you no harm and there is good discipline to be had by trying to write it  Translation is likewise good training if you find that your original matter wobbles when you try to rewrite it The meaning of the poem to be translated can not wobble  If you are using a symmetrical form don t put in  what you want to say and then fill up the remaining  vacuums with slush    Don t mess up the perception of one sense by trying to define it in terms of another This is usually only the result of being too lazy to find the exact word To this clause there are possibly exceptions  The first three simple proscriptions will throw out nine tenths of all the bad poetry now accepted as standard and classic and will prevent you from many a crime of production   Mais d abord il faut etre un poete as MM Duhamel and Vildrac have said at the end of their little book Notes sur la Technique Poetique but in an American one takes that at least for granted otherwise why does one get born upon that august continent  Ezra Pound  NOTES  Agnes Lee Mrs Otto Freer who has lived much

individuality in manner and conception is tempered by a perfect knowledge of his medium of expression  Helen Redeemed is a splendid narrative poem of the awakening of Helen s loyalty and love for her husband and of the part she played in destroying Troy Several of the other longer poems strikingly original in conception and form show a living sympathy with the Greek spirit and viewpoint notably the Argive Women and Hypsiplyle The Fourteen Sonnets are beautiful in form idea and feeling and several of the brief visions called up in epigrammata suggest the Japanese in purity delicacy and vividness  THE MORTAL SOULS AND OTHER DRAMAS  By OLIVE TILFORD DARGAN  A new volume illustrative of Mrs Dargan s talent is a welcome literary event She holds a unique position among her compatriots not to say among her contemporaries both as a poet and as a dramatist Los Angeles Times  Establishes yet more firmly her position among the foremost American writers of dramas Chicago Record Herald  To say that she writes as vividly as dramatically and as poetically as some of these who have won much fame would be going none too far Mrs Dargan is a dramatic poet of power Chicago Tribune  1 50 Net

ANNUALLY for over twenty years after his generous and friendly habit Mr Mosher has sent far and wide A List of Books in Belles Lettres issued in Choice and Limited Editions as artistic without and as filled with treasure within as is every book which comes from him But these catalogues have been far more than lists of his rare publications Scattered throughout them have appeared excerpts of prose and verse whose selection and arrangement have given the catalogues a value as unique as their format And although it be possible that relatively few readers could adequately appreciate the thought and labor which went into their making no one who has read them but has won delight for eye and brain and heart To many has come a regret that such wealth of literary treasure should be in so perishable a form This regret the editor of the Bibelot has heard and answered For in this book are gathered those flowers of thought which were published year by year in the catalogues plucked many of them from well known highways plucked many of them from byways hitherto little known perhaps wholly unknown and bound by the yearly greetings of the editor to his readers his friends  When I may never meet nor greet other than in these words  A gentle melancholy underlies much of the thought This however is never pessimistic and rising higher and higher through the conquest of self sings its victory in There will come a time when it shall be light and when man shall awaken from his lofty dreams and find his dreams still there and that nothing has gone save his sleep We do not quote All book lovers will read for themselves welcoming many friends long known and other newer ones Mr Mosher has done for literature especially for belles lettres a beneficent work None of it carries a stronger appeal than this message of love courage and optimism Boston Transcript  925 copies F cap octavo Van Gelder hand made paper old style boards 1 75 net  50 copies on Japan vellum numbered 34 00
