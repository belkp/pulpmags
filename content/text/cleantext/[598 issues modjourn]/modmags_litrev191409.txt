suburbs of Eternitywill it die ArmageddonTHE greatest war of history flames away all other human concernsUpon the reaction of humanity to this gigantic thing depends the future No one can foresee what will happen to the cultures and the peoples which already crackle in its vortexIt is more profitable to search the heart of America A great newspaper has published a cartoon picturing Uncle Sam on a harvesting machinecalmly sayingGiddapto his horseswhile a neglected sheet with the inscriptionEuropean warblows to one sideAs long as devastation and horror do not exist on his own piece of landUncle Sam doesn t care while he can harvest his wheat and sell it at a good high price to starving peopleEven the dramatic aspect of the tremendous conflict does not impinge on his provincial consciousnessCan this contemptible attitude represent that of any great number of our peopleOne cannot escape the feeling that it is the usual reaction of the newspaper to any thing outside ofbusiness whether it be social miseryor an interesting ideaBut in this case its brutish stupidity is so flagrantly apparent that even the majority must revolt from it A more creditable reaction is angerWith such titanic wrath blazing in Europeany sensitive person must reflect a little of itAnger at whatWe don t know precisely until we stop to thinkThe emotion comes before the intellectual objectiveAnger perhaps at the terrific human wasteTwenty odd million men flying at each other s throats and destroying the bitterly won triumphs of years of peacewithout any good reasonWe hear phrases likebalance of powerdynastic supremacythe life of our countrypatriotismracial prejudicedifference of religion Each individual nation is praying to God with profound sincerity for its own successPriests bless the armsThere is no denying the reality of all this in the consciousness of EuropeSuch things do lead men to battle with the fire of conviction Wellthe brutal fact stands out like a giant against the skythat if such motives can produce such a resultthey are working only for their own destructionNot a single nationwhether conqueror or victimcan come out of the struggle as strong or as great as it went inAll alike must be swept into destitution of all the things civilization has taught us to valueAnd this is the result of civilizationIt is a spectacle or demoniac laughter And shall the United States stand aloof with a feeling of pitying superioritythinking thatbecause we happen to have a president instead of a kingand inhabit a different continentsuch motives are foreign to usWhat folly of conceitAs long as we cultivate the ideal of patriotismas long as we put economic value above spiritual and human valueas long as in our borders there exist dogmatic religionsas long as we consider desirable the private ownership and exploitation of property for private profit whether by nations or by individuals we maintain those elements of civilization which have led Europe to the present crisis Do not think that we shall ever escape wrathhatredviolenceThe so calledprimitive emotionsare giving incontrovertible proof of strong present existenceThe thing to do is to turn all the emotionswhich are eternalinto new forms which shall not be self destructivewhich shall propel instead of oppose the starward march of mankindViolenceYesif it destroys something hateful Nineteenth

pleaded with those in authority to be taken inIt is real war with us I was told and we have reached the stage whereeven at the sacrifice of being regarded as insane and fools by the worldwe cannot stop to explain all over again It was not curiosityI urgedor lack of understandingI believed in votesbut I believed in women moreI wanted to feel as well as understand their great Purpose My earnestness won their faithand for two weeks my senses were saturated with every emotion that prevailed in the Englishwomen s fight against their own country and the rest of the world The Little Review 5I saw their ammunition stored in back bedrooms of hidden housescotton soaked in kerosenesmall bags of stonebottles filled with queer smelling liquidsand now and then a small bomb filled with powder ormetalAll this I considered very formidable then and marvelled at the women s courage in handling the materialScared and horrifiedI witnessed the burning of two famous old churchesI helped in the heckling of public speakersand remonstrated with the police at their outrages upon unoffending womenThe spiritual urge of the fighting women transmitted itself to me and I found myself supporting them with a courage not natural to meThatthe character of their protest might be pettytactlessunwomanlyor even futilemattered notfor one felt that they were soldiers fighting in a great causethe slogan of which wasGive us a chance to develop a better race of men and women And the Englishmen looked on ashamed of their womenkindand the rest of the world snickered And then the cataclysm of war descended upon all Europe and civilized man went mad for murderwholesale terrible murder without reason or purposeSickened by the cry for bloodthe women s fight became holy in its significance to meI saw England change in five minutes when on the streets of London the first cry of war was heardIn a lightning shift Trafalgar Square became a seething mass of gesticulating peoplea mob which seemed instantly to drop its sacred inheritance ofgood formand give way to wild and ominous protest and speak eloquently ofan honorto be upheld but just whatthe honorwas no one seemed to know Berlin sang all

promises to give what is left of them the right to their mother tongue and the privilege to worship God in their own way And what of the womenFor the first time I felt the real greatness of the women

Shops and SoulsA VERY eminent American professor has recently declared that American literary criticism is deficientthat the commercialism of publishers is largely responsibleThe first proposition is obviousthe second defensibleThe professor further argues for a criticism based on academic standardswhich he says are as immutable as the ten commandments and he couples this with the declaration that criticism finds its justification in the desire of the public to know what it is buyingThe immutable standards are to correspond with the government approved weights and measures of the grocer shop It would be enlightening to give the professor an opportunity to try his planLet some millionaireinstead of starting a new collegeendow a critical magazine for the professorIn the first number should be announced the fixed standards by which all literature is to be judgedThen would follow calmirrefutable issues in which the principles of unitycoherenceemphasis and perhaps one or two other measuresshould be applied to new literatureThe publiceager for standard articleswouldof coursenever again read Hall Caine and Harold Bell WrightThe commercialization of literature would be abolishedfor would not the professor declare it to be against the decalogueAnd there would arise a new generation of writerscarefully observing all academic rulesand scrupulously giving the public full measure of what it wantsA veritable Utopiaan apotheosis of the grocer shopButhowever much we may doubt the possibility of such a thingwe cannot oppose the professorbecause he has disarmed opposition by predicting itOf coursehe says in effectthere will arise hordes of youngill seasonedand irresponsible persons who will deny my sound positionBut don t let them trouble you they are of a piece with all the queer people who nowadays are advancing preposterous new ideasAs if anything that is not sanctioned by tradition could possibly be taken seriouslyVery wellwe won t oppose the professorWe are quite willing to let him go ahead pigeon holing the kind of literature that appeals to himand anything he may be able to do in turning the public taste from Hall Caine deserves approbationBut in the meantime we shall assiduously forget about himand try some experiments of our own in the effort to say vital things about literature In the first placewe don t believe in the majority rule for writersWe don t believe that a writer ever lived who wrote anything really good because he thought the reading public wanted itOur conviction is based on the testimony of writers themselvesA writer should write what is in himnot what is in the publicHe has no excuse for writing unless he is a strongermore sensitiveand more intelligent man than either his readers8 The Little Reviewor his criticsThat is the first distinction between the manufacturer of sausages and the maker of books In the second placewe don t believe in the subjection of writers to criticsor to fixed standardsor to anything except themselvesWhatever excuse there is for standards arises from the fact that writers have furnished the examples on which the standards are foundedThe writer must find his authority in his own soulThe one thing he must do is to say what he has to say in the way which seems to him rightThe history of art is one long example of the discarding by genius of rules founded on previous workWhen was a new technique ever predicted by the academic criticWhen has not the new genius been bitterly fought by the academic criticThe natural history of art is thisfirst the artistthen the intelligent criticthen the appreciative public The function of the critic is to be a warrior for the artistHe must understand profoundlyhe must be quick to detect and denounce artistic insincerityhe must declare the man who has attained the magic of real aesthetic rightnessThe recognition of artistic excellence does not proceed by the scaffolding of academicism it is instinctivejust as its creation was instinctiveemotionalThe critic mayif he likesoppose the artistbut his first duty is to make him knownHe must say to the publicnotyou will like this manbutyou must like this manor at least you must experience him No critic is fit to do these things unless he understands the passionate independence of the real artisthis service of no law except inner necessity Our spiritual world is tangled up in mechanismNo sooner does a fresh wind make itself known than we try to imprison it in a systemto impale it with a classificationLet us have done with these futilitiesThe important joy is to feel the mysterious and dynamic glory of the windWe need in our criticismas in our literaturemore insightmore emotionmore of the power that is produced by virility and the corresponding female quality for which there is as yet no adequate nameThe heightening of consciousnessthe intensifying of essential valuesthese shall be our critiical aims A sense of the obviousness of what we have said prevents us from amplifying itOur excuse for saying it is that there are still many professors in the worldThere is nothing sane about the worship of beautyIt is something entirely too splendid to be saneOscar WildeThe Little Review 9The Democrat With apologies to MrGalsworthyknew himself for a democratHe might be with a crowd of what he calledreal peopleand if he happened to pass a waiter who had served him or a barber who had shaved him he would speak to themHe would do it without the least embarrassment or condescension anything else he would have considered lowHis friends knew him to be essentially democratic they would assure you of this quality in him as something that only the morally courageous possess To have explained that his attitude was a matter of common sense rather than democracy would have left him bewilderedSurely every one recognized that there were certain barriers that had to be maintained it was not a question of snobbishnessbut simply of natural lawThe man who had pushed ahead and made something of himself was more entitled to the respect of his fellows than the waiter who was content to spend his life serving other peopleTake himselffor exampleHe might have been a bricklayer if he had not worked hard enough to be a power on the Board of TradeHe had done it all himself and he knew the difficulties of the struggleHe could remember the time when he would hire a taxi and dash all over town to find the special brand of cigarettes he likedOf course he realized now that that was an extravagant and foolish thing to do but after all a boy must have his taste ofsporting And thenof coursethere was nothing harmful in chasing around town for cigarettes in a taxiHe might have been doing something really wrong insteadsuch as marrying a chorus girl or becoming one of those revolutionists who worries his friends to death by fighting for the proletariat and getting into jail as a consequenceNothank heavenhe had had his little flingsbut he had always kept his headHe had never really done anything to disgrace himself or his friendsBut it was a hard struggleand he respected anyone who had come through it successfullyThat was the reason of his insistence on natural barriersThat was the reason he felt it an honor to shake the hand of a great man the man who had made a million by his skilful corner of the wheat marketfor instanceHe had a real respect for brainsfor powerfor achievementfor all the things that keep a man from being a weakling Not that he worshipped power or made a god of successOn the contraryhe was something of an idealist himselfthough not the sort literary people talk aboutHe always made it a point to state that he had no use for literaryideas Those people didn t really know what they were talking aboutThey were so impractical they wanted to change the face of the earth and they seemed to think that ideas would do itButThe Little Revieweven for that sort of thing he had a certain tolerance he remembered how he had planned long ago to be a missionaryto go to the ends of the world and help peopleHe did not remember just what he wanted to help them tobut it was a sort of plan to ease his conscience when he felt he wasn t doing any good in the worldHoweverhe had got over that in the same way he had given up his vision of the brown stone mansion with which he had planned at eighteen to delight the woman he married He was very humantoobut he did demand certain standards of conductThere was nothing he hated like snobbishnesshe would always speak to anybodyno matter what he had donebut beyond that he respected himself and his friends too much to ventureWhen the men at his club pointed outwith their knowing winksthat a certain woman wasoutsidewellthat was enough for himHe would never do anything to push her further downbut he could at least warn his friendsAnd he had an infinite disgusta pitying contempt for those who suggested that circumstances may have had something to do with itAs though it were not the prime business of every human being to fight circumstances as though he himself might not have been a regular Mark Lennan if he had let himself goEvery man had these things in himThat was the trouble with such writers as Galsworthy they helped people to tolerate weaknesseven to see a certain beauty in itIt had got to be the fashionespecially amongliterarycirclesto break away from standardizationsThe persons who did so were given credit for living a fuller LifeHow he hated their talk what rot it was to suppose that any life could be full or rich unless it were a good lifeAnd if there was anything in the worldin these hysterical timesto which a man could anchorit was the fact that good was good and bad was badand even a child knew which was whichThere was no arguing about it But people seldom argued with him because he disarmed them beforehand by declaring that it didn t matter what any one thoughtall these things had been settled for us long agothey were the very bulwark of our progressour prosperityour whole civilizationIt was strange that the people who most enjoyed the benefits of that civilization should be the ones to abuse itIf one must know outcastsand one might of course be able to help themlet him confine the acquaintanceship to his office or some place where he would not run the risk of influencing other peopleHe remembered with horror a woman he had once known who could never understand these distinctionsHe had not tried to dissuade her from knowing any one in the world she wanted to know but he had begged her to be discreet about itat leastto remember her responsibilities in the matter on account of her friendsand to be sure thatthose peoplewere made to feel the inevitable barrier between Good Godhe had said I m democratic and all thatbut you can t let people of that sort feel they re yourThe Little ReviewequalsEventually he stopped worrying about the womanafter she told him that she would be proud to be as big and fine as those friends of hersWhat was the useShe must have been a little insane all the timebecause he knew that she was a good womanand thosefriendsof hers were the sort who believed in free love and that kind of thingsome of them had even been in jail for preaching anarchism He had solved such problems in his own case much in the same way he had solved the question of his family relationshipsHe had been brought up in a home where card playingsmokingtheatre goingetc were forbiddenHis life as a man had of course included all these evilsBut whenever he visited the old home he reverted to the old orderHe would no more think of smoking a cigarette in his mother s presence than he would think of telling her how vital a part of his life the theatre had becomeHe had too much respect for herHe knew it would hurt herand his love and reverence for her were too deep to allow of that Something of the same simplicity and clarity colored his ideas of propertyLet each man work for his little plot of groundown itand live on itThat would do away with all this fuss and competitionHe knew there were people who talked vaguely about property being robbery but what was there to keep the ambition in a manmake a good citizen of himif it were not his struggle for possession of something he might call his ownIf he had not had his little plot to look forward toand the thought of the woman who was to share it with himhe would long ago have stopped working and started off to the South Sea Islandswandering about the earth aimlessly without any incentiveIncidentallyhis idea of the woman who was to share the plot was very interestingHe was not one to talk bromidioms about woman s place being in the homeor to discredit the achievements of the new womanBut the fact remained that the new woman knew too much to be a comfortable companionHe refused to be tyrannized he would marry one of those sweet feminine women who didn t know anything and live in peace and freedom Sometimes he got rather sick of life and found himself in thatwhat s the use moodIt worried him a littleIn the same manner that he had driven around in a taxi for cigarettes he now lounged about in hotel corridors or at his clubwatching the peoplespeculating about lifeIt seemed a waste of timeratheryet it harmed no one and it kept him from a good many worse thingsHis conscience was clearwhich was more than most men could sayHe knew menThe only thing that really weighed upon him seriously was the fact that he was getting a little too fatHe would have to try to eat less True to his creedhis faith was in the peoplethe great mass of people whose instincts always led them to the right thingIt was a safe rule to go bythat of mistrusting the personality who did not measure up to thedecent averageIt was the way to keep sane and healthfulSocialists and anarchists and syndicalists and radicals in generalwhat were they but abnormalitiesHe would never be guilty of the narrow attitude that they ought to be hangedthey would quite naturally fritter themselves outfor what they were all trying to achieve was individualism pure and simpleand that would never buy bread for the working man or lift him to happinessHe might not be right about these thingsof course but he had thought them outYeshe believed in the people he believed in their rights and he believed in being kind to themThere was no telling how much good a cheery smile might doand so he smiled constantlyA great man had once told him that he made it a point to cultivate friendships only among those people who could help him and this seemed very sensible to the democratHe practiced it assiduouslywith the result that he never lost that satisfying glow which comes in with shaking a hand that belongs with a full dress shirtMCAThe Constructive Reasoner A Non Mythical Allegory GEORGE SOULEHE was born in the glacial ageThey originally called him something elsebut as soon as he was old enough to talk he lisped the tertiary dialect forconstructive reasoner when they paid any attention to himLater he was recognized by his characteristic expression Yesbut When he was ten years old he watched his fatherwith much skill and heroismslaying a musk ox Why did you kill himhe asked To eat was the reply Yes replied the prodigy but what will you put in his place The misguided parent glared at his son without replyingand passed him a second jointwhich was consumed with relish The tragedy of his early life was to watch the glaciers slowly leveling mountains and laying up vast wastes of terminal moraine without conscious purposeAll this destruction weighed on his soul He was ever an observerAs time went onhis intellect grew more ponderousHe saw mankind slay the dinosaursrob the earth of its mineralshew down vast treesand agitate the earth with rude plowsAgitators were particularly distasteful to himHe stood aloof from these movementsbecause he did not believe in destructionAnd when men finally set sail onThe Little Review The seashe was moved to poetic rancor You are destroying the mystery of the oceanhe criedBut he built himself a fine house from the products of their commerce He was in Rome when the Goths swept down over Italy and sacked it What will you give us instead he asked their leaderThe Northerner frankly did not know You have no right to sweep away something that has been established so long unless you can put in its place something better he complainedThe great Goth laughed and grabbed another handful of jewels Religions seemed to him peculiarly sacredWith great satisfaction he watched the burning of the early Christian agitatorswho were attempting to tear in pieces the comfortable old hierarchy of Jove What is this Utopian theory of theirs he askedderisively It won t workYou can t change human nature in a dayWhen they give us a program I can t pick flaws inI will listen to them Later he was particularly incensed at Martin Luther and remonstrated with him for undermining so many personssimple faith without giving them something that would exactly fill its place In the modern world he found a very comfortable nicheA city of tradesmen offered him the post of chief prophetNot that they bothered much about his great principlebut he always did his best to stave off the destructive elements of societywho interfered with businessHe advised people to be comfortable and quietHe deplored violence of any kindSane progress was all very wellbut he always demanded progress of visionaries and theoristsand he always pointed out tremendous flaws in their programsHe opposed bitterly anything in the nature of tariff reform or anti trust lawsSuch things destroyed business confidenceand were not the business men the great constructive element in societyTo women who wanted the votehe saidWoman s place is in the homeIf you had your wayyou would destroy the family He supported practical men for office One day he came upon a workman wrecking an old buildingThe sight filled him with painHe went up to the man and asked him if he were sure that the new building would be better than the oldif in fact it would stand at allTo his great surprise the workman paid no attention to himAgain the constructive reasoner put the question he even touched the workman on the shoulderBut it was as if the questioner did not existHe was angry and chagrinedThen it dawned on him that he was deadUnconsciously he had become a ghost Jehovah appointed a private judgment day for himThe dead hero came before the throne Who are you asked the ruler of the universe I am the constructive reasoner he replied proudly What have you constructed was the next questionFor the first time since his birththe mortal was at a lossNever mind said Jehovah you have earned Heavenfor there all The Little Reviewis peace and perfectionthere no one tears down or builds up And so Jehoah put him into a place which was labeledHeaven and locked the gate on the outside For a while the saved soul sat on a golden throne and was contentedBut soon he began to be a little boredHe went to an older inhabitant and asked him what one does in Heaven Nothing was the answer The place is populated with souls who have done nothing but try to get hereand now they must rest from their laborsWhat can there be to doin a place that is perfectFor a moment the new arrival suspected for the first time that all these years he had been mistakenWould it not be better to be building somethingeven if one had to destroy something else as a preliminaryBut he layed the suspicion aside as unworthy of him Before I can logically object to Heaven he thought I must propose something betterAnd of coursethat is impossible So he sat down againto await Eternity GS Patriotismsiris the last resort of scoundrelsDrJohnsonThe Little Review The Crucified DionysusALEXANDER SKAUNACHAD HA AMin his admirable essayPriest and Prophetdifferentiates between the two ways of serving an IdeaThe Prophet is essentially one sided a certain idea fills his whole beingmasters his every feeling and sensationengrosses his whole attentionHis gaze is fixed always on what ought to be in accordance with his own convictionsnever on what can be consistently with the general condition of things outside himselfHe is a primal forceThe Priest also fosters the Ideaand desires to perpetuate it but he is not of the race of giantsInstead of clinging to the narrowness of the Prophetand demanding of reality what it cannot givehe broadens his outlookand takes a wider view of the relation between his Idea and the facts of lifeNot what ought to bebut what can beis what he seeksThe Idea of the Priest is not a primal force it is an accidental complex of various forcesamong which there is no essential connectionTheir temporary union is due simply to the fact that they have happened to come into conflict in actual lifeand have been compelled to compromise and join handsThe Priest sooner or later becomes a dominant forcean interpretera teacher the Prophet remains all his lifea man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth and is cried after The Prophet is a foolthe spiritual man is mad Throughout the ages we have seen the repetition of this phenomenonfrom Jeremiah to Nietzschefrom Paul to BrandesThe narrow mindedhapless giants have been sowing seed for future generations the broad minded interpreters have been cultivating the soil for their contemporaries Friedrich Nietzscheby George Brandesrecently published by the Macmillan companyadds little new to the vast interpretative literature on the creator of ZarathustraThe book contains a moderate essay on Aristocratic Radicalismwritten in 1889a necrologa brief note on Ecce Homoand a few letters interchanged between the philosopher and the criticIn the last twenty five years life and literatureperhaps I ought to say art in generalhave been so profoundly influenced by Nietzschean views that the source of those views has ceased to be discernableFrom Gorky s Bosyaki and the types of D Annunzio down to the Manifestoes of the Futuriststhe aphorisms and paradoxes of Nietzsche have been sounded and resounded on various scalesand the slogan of Transvaluation of Values has been echoed and re echoed from the college platformfrom the pulpitfrom the soap boxfrom the stageeven from the cabaret and music hallsthe Ueberbrettlmovement in central Europe Perhaps the American public has been toobusyto be touched by that hurricaneso that it was left to DrFoster to appear in our day and proclaim with prophetic fervor and pathos thenewDecaloguebut then our neophytes will hardly find adequate DrBrandesEssay written in 1889when Nietzsche was practically unknown Yet this belated book in its somewhat belated English translation contains an invaluable featurethe correspondence between Nietzsche and Brandes The letters he sent me in that last year of his conscious lifesays the famous critic appear to me to be of no little psychological and biographical interest Indeed soand what is morethey reveal a bit of the reserved personality of Brandes and provoke the reader to venture a comparison between the correspondents From the very first we mark the distinct characteristics of the Priest and the ProphetThe carefulcorrectand clear interpreterand the bewilderingcascading revaluator of lifeorto use Ben Zakkay s metaphorthe plastered well that does not lose a dropand the powerful spring ever shooting forth new streams the earnest professor offering practical suggestionstelling of the book binderof the copyright businessand of the big audiences at his lecturesand the seething three parts blindsufferer who swings his imagination on revolutionizing Europebringingthe whole world into convulsions The difference in the style of writing is also characteristicAs against Brandes free and graceful French way in which he handles the language Nietzsche thus explains hisdifficult positionOn the scale of my experiences and circumstancesthe predominance is given to the rarerremotermore attenuated tones as against the normalmedial onesBesidesas an old musicianwhich is what I really am I have an ear for quarter tonesFinallyand this probably does more to make my books obscurethere is in me a distrust of dialecticseven of reasonsWhat a person already holdstrue or has not yet acknowledged as trueseems to me to depend mainly on his courageon the relative strength of his courageI seldom have the courage for what 1 really knowTo which Brandes comments with his usual clarity You write more for yourselfthink more of yourself in writingthan for the general public whereas most non German writers have been obliged to force themselves into a certain

individualitythe anonymous in himI have thus been horrified at times to see how little of my inmost self is more than hinted at in my writings The earnest tone of Brandesletters is at times counteracted by a humorous frolic on the part of his correspondentI even suspect an ironical smile curving around the Polish mustachewhenfor instanceNietzsche confesses hisadmiration for the tolerance of your judgmentas much as for the moderation of your sentences Or as when Brandes confesses At the risk of exciting your wrath Wagner s Tristan und Isolde made an indelible impression on meI once

continuously tantalizes him with such exclamations as What a pity that so learned a philologist as you should not understand Danish Back comes a flashAhhow industrious you are And idiot that I amnot to understand Danish I am tempted to bring another illustration of the profound earnestness of the Priest as against the plausible light mindedness of the Prophet Brandes writesI am delighted with the aphorism on the hazard of marriageBut why do you not dig deeper hereYou speak somewhere with a certain reverence of marriagewhich by implying an emotional ideal has idealized emotionherehoweveryou are more blunt and forcibleWhy not for once say the full truth about itI am of opinion that the institution of marriagewhich may have been very useful in taming brutescauses more misery to mankind than even the church has doneChurchmonarchymarriagepropertythese are to my mind four old venerable institutions which mankind will have to reform from the foundations in order to be able to breathe freelyAnd of these marriage alone kills the individualityparalyzes liberty and is the embodiment of a paradoxBut the shocking thing about it is that humanity is still too coarse to be able to shake it offThe most emancipated writersso calledstill speak of marriage with a devout and virtuous air which maddens meAnd they gain their pointsince it is impossible to say what one could put in its place for the mobThere is nothing else to be done but slowly to transform opinionWhat do you think about it And this is what Nietzsche thinks about itI feel for you in the Northnow so wintry and gloomy how

in the Galeby Arturo Giovannitti Hillacre BookhouseRiversideConnecticutTHERE are many ways in which we can approach this curious and portentous volumeWe may confine ourselves solely to the technique of the writingbutin so doingwe should ignore the most important and compelling part of the book its spiritThere is something which flames through these poems that abashes one who would content himself with a sterile commentary on the versificationonly those who are afraid of life would take refuge in such pedantic air beating In this book there is a combination of two of the most significant personalities of our timeThe preface is written by that miracle incarnate Helen KellerIn it she gives us the background of the poemsa background of tumultuous class conflictThe awakening of the working classand its surprising growth of self reliance and militancyis the inspiration of the bookand Helen Keller announces herself for it and with it Giovannitti himself is a remarkable man of remarkable antecedentsHe emigrated from his native Italy at the age of seventeenand was precipitated into our whirl of economic struggleHe worked in Pennsylvania in the coal mines andlaterassumed the position which he still holds that of editor of the Italian revolutionary weeklyIl ProletarioIn the now famous Lawrence strike he was one of those who were most valuable in stimulating the sense of solidarity among the workers and in maintaining their enthusiasmTogether with Joseph JEttor and Carusohe spent several months in jailawaiting his trial on a faked up murder chargeThewere acquittednot so much because of the legal justice of their cause but because of the fact that their condemnation would have resulted in the paralysis of the textile industryWith their threat of general strike the workers forced the courts of their masters to deliver up to them their captive spokesmenThe excitement and publicity resultant from the Lawrence Strike brought into prominence the ideas of Giovannitti and others who were espousers of the Syndicalist ideawhich in this country is expressed through the organization known as the Industrial Workers of the World It is necessary to have some idea of these matters in order to appreciate the leit motif of this bookAll through it flares that spirit of impatient revoltthat spurning of most of the scaffolding of our decrepit civilization which is usually held up for admiration to the budding youth of this countryCourts of lawchurchesand parliaments all fall under the blinding fire of the bitter contempt of this workman in revolt Despite occasional faults in form or stressand we must rememberThe Little Review 23that Giovannitti is writing in an alien tonguethe poems are vibrant with life and some of them express with truest art things which are not always considered by our academic friends to be at all within the province of poetry Sometimes the formal verse forms are used andat other timesthe poet has recourse to the free rhythmic mode of WhitmanPersonallyI think that the best work is in the free verseThe Walkera jail experience of Giovannitti sis a wonderful piece of work and should be bracketed with The Ballad of Reading GaolThe finest thing in the book is The Cagea poem which appeared originally in The Atlantic Monthlyand which is one of the few things which have preserved that journal from irredeemable mediocrity The Cage expresses the thoughts and emotions of the writer when he stood with his two comrades in the dock of Salem courthouseThe contrast is drawn between the outworn formalities and rites of the law and the lusty life of labor between the dead lives of the dismal practitioners of a stilted and tyrannical formula and the life of vigorous conflict of the awakening working classThis is the inside of the court roomIn the middle of the great greenish room stood the green iron cageAll was oldand cold and mournfulancient with the double antiquity of heart and brain in the great greenish roomOld and hoary was the man who sat upon the faldstoolupon the tireless and godless altarOld were the tomes that mouldered behind him on the dusty shelvesOld was the man upon his left who awoke with his cracked voice the dead echoes of dead centuriesold the man upon his right who wielded a wand and old all those who spoke to him and listened to him before and around the green iron cage Old were the words they spokeand their faces were drawn and white and lifelesswithout expression or solemnity like the ikons of old cathedrals For of naught they knewbut of what was written in the oldyellow booksAnd all the joys and the pains and the loves and hatreds and furies and labors and strifes of manall the fierce and divine passions that battle and rage in the heart of mannever entered into the great greenish room but to sit in the green iron cage Senilitydullness and dissolution were all around the green iron cageand nothing was new and young and alive in the great roomexcept the three men who were in the cage Andthenwhen the prosecutor speakswe have an insight into the fervor with which Giovannitti greets the overthrow of the old and the budding of the newhe saidand dreary as a wind that moans thru the crosses of an old graveyard was his voice I will prove to you that these three men in the cage are criminals and murderers and that they ought to be put to deathLoveit was then that I heard for the first time the creak of the moth that was eating the old painting and the old booksand the worm that was gnawing the old benchand it was then that I saw that all the old men around the great greenish room were dead They were dead like the old man in the paintingsave that they could still read the old books he could read no moreand still spoke and heard the old words he could speak and hear no moreand still passed the judgment of the deadwhich he could no more passupon the mighty life of the world outside that throbbed and thundered and clamored and roared the wonderful anthem of human labor to the fatherly justice of the Sun To me such stuff as this means a hundred times more than a thousand sonnets to a mistresseye lashor than the weak maudlinities of an absinthe soaked eroto dabblerwailing puling repentance to a pale ChristIt is compact of lifelife as it is todaymadenot for the tittillation of dilletantesbut for the enjoyment and inspiration of men who can appreciate the meat of life redolent of sweat and blood and tears This is Giovannitti s picture of the Republicafter it had been gained with blood and sacrifice When night with velvet sandaled feet Stole in her chamber s solitudeBehold she lay there nakedlewdA drunken harlot of the street With withered breasts and shaggy hair Soiled by each wantonfrothy kissBetween a sergeant of police And a decrepit millionaire Love poems also figure in the bookbut the dominant note is that of conflictGiovannitti has realized the pregnant fact that in struggle is the greatest joythat the ecstasy of growth and striving is worth more that the bovine placidity ofhappiness At the end of his love songThe Praise of Springhe saysBut shall I sing of love nowI who could only sing to the tune of the clarions of warAnd shall I forget for a woman my black frothing horse that neighs after the twanging arrows in the windAnd shall I not lose my strength when her arms shall encircle me where thou hast girt me with the swordO Geamy mother immortal Giovannitti makes no claim for inclusion in Parnassian galleriesHe believes that deeds count for more than wordsand he essays but to make a handful of war songs for the pleasure of his comrades Still may my songbefore the sun s Reveillespeed the hours that tireWhile they are cleaning up their guns Around the cheery bivouac fire The Little ReviewAnd sothese are the rough hewn songs of a man of one who goes his way with his love upholding him and the Vision burning within him and the sound of battle forever in his ears and the whole hearted hate of his enemy to spur himand the stalwart comradeship of his fellows to make dear the thorny wayThe Nietzschean Love of EternityGEORGE BURMAN FOSTERallthere have been great wars before this pan European cataclysm andnaturally enoughaccording to the psychological law of the expansion of the emotionsmen have transferred their experiences of time to the content of eternityThusamid the

bank and shoal of timechildren easily and happily forget the tribulations of a bygone hourin eternitynevernever again But might there not be also an eternity of childish play and joyEven sothat could not tip the scale in view of the possibility of a comfortless and cruel eternity especially since the possibility becomes a probabilityand the probability a certaintyowing to the fact that the children are taught to consider themselves as lost and damned sinners in Adam s fall they sinned all Consequently the remote hope of bliss inJerusalem the golden with milk and honey blestcould not assuage the grief nor silence the terror and torture that filled the child mind WouldThe Little Reviewthat there were no eternityoften this must have been the secret thought of German childrenand not of these alone This is the eternity of fear From the nursery and school to the world of thought From gruesome pictures and poetry of the enigma of eternity to the solution in systems of the philosophers and theologiansFrom Rist of the Thirty YearsWar to Spinoza with imperturbable philosophic calmsuch was the great change through which many a German child passedSpinoza who won his deepest

overpopulated as it is with Augenblicksmenschenas Nietzsche would sayand not with Eivigkeitsmenschcnwhy recall the love and hope of a long lost past The Little Review 27Such queries may give us pausebut they may not stampede usWe may not forget that Professor Munsterbergof Harvardhas written a great book bearing the impressive titleThe Eternal ValuesNor may we be blind to the evidence that the thought so clearly and singularly espoused by the bearers of the better ideals of our new time is that of the imminent and constant eternity in the human heartas unfolded by Spinoza and Schleiermacher and NietzscheIndeedthe question as to what values are eternal valuesthis eternity questionis central in our modern cultureVery superficial indeed would be our evaluation of modern lifemost un understood indeed would be the riddle of the soul of this lifedid we ignore the ever clearerever mightier longing for eternity in this soul s abyssand the unification of all deeper spirits upon the high task of giving an eternal content to our culture By taking some illustrationsone can see the need to supply the latter profound view to the former superficial judgmentif one is to do justice to the new movements of life in the modern world There is your modern poetAt first sight he seems to lack the illumination of that eternal light which never was on land or seaYou see the scorching sun beating upon the lone pilgrim as he plods through the burning sand to a goalless goalYou see fadedpale shadowsYou do not meet with an idea that makes you feel that the poet yearns to interpret some eternal thought to this life of oursInsteadlife speaks only of itself and from itselfThis is an abomination in the eyes of those who call themselves EwigkcitsmenschcnThey call it naturalisticmaterialistic artThey upbraid an era in which a poet may dare to dissociate his poetry from the eternal idealThen you look againyou read more carefullyand you see the whole matter differentlyThe eternity that men claimed for their thought is indeed goneBut eternity itselfthe eternity of lifethat is not gonethat abidesThis realistic man of modern poetrythe more really he is apprehendedstands before us as the embodiment of a necessitya necessity that transcends the individualyet lives and weaves in hima necessity that enunciates the law of life in the destiny of the individual power of darkness or dawn of a new day But necessitylaw of lifethis is but another name for eternity And there again is your modern painterHetoopresents us with a bitoften a tiny bitof realityof natureA rotten trunk of some old tree a dilapidated hut on a ledge some God forsaken nook of earthlost and forgotten of man a bent and broken man with his hoe some poor wretch with pistol against his skull some traveller bleeding unbandaged by the roadsidethere they all are in the galleries of our modern realismBut look againand you will see that the keen observant eye of your artist serves an artist s heartseeks and finds eternityand directs our slower vision to the eternal mystery he has foundthe most inspiring of all mysteries viz greatness in the least and lowestglory and beauty in the offensive and repellantinvaluable human worth and nobility in the depraved and downtroddenThere also is your man of science as he moves out along new pathsStorming the skyunlocking all the eternities so long sought for behind the worldwhat does the scientist s supreme power and consecration consist in but his steadfast and strenuous search for eternityHe not only seekshe findsHe finds eternal life and eternal love in the daintiest fernin the tiniest lichenIn the very dust beneath our feet he descries what was there before men were at allHe points us to men as they emerge from the unplumbed aeonian abyssbearing in their bodies still visible and tangible traces of an eternal lifeHe reveals an eternal content of being in all that lives and weaves and moves Trulyif there is no sign of an eternity in which we livethere is no sign of an eternity at allBut if you were to bring to its simplest and truest expression all that is great and overmastering in the life of the human spirit todayyou would then have once again the exultant Zarathrustra songIch liebe dicho Ewigkeit All that lends true worth to the life that now is and is to beis contained in this songA present eternity we seek as the one thing needfulWhat we love must be near uswe must feel it and grasp itBe it never so remoteit is the magic of love to bring the remote nigh our heartsorbetter stillto conquer space and timeso that there is no near and no faronly a life and love that is eternalTo create such Ewigkeitsmenscher is the great goal of the new lifethe prophecy of a new cultureFor this new culture we need men who feel something in their own being that uplifts them above all the experience of the presentmuch as they may seem imprisoned thereinmen who dominate life in a royal fashionmen who in confident freedom do not mind the storms which would hurl them from their pathWe need men who survey the great connections of the world from peak to peak and overbridge them with their own soulsmen who release destiny from its isolation and articulate it in the eternal cycle of human lifemen whose own being contains all life according to its eternal substanceuttering theiryea and amento

gaze upon their Master mounting heavenward into the cloudsand they hear strange words of the Christ coming down from heaven again to abide with them all the days till the end of the worldNietzsche

Review The Stigma of Knowing It All of the most exasperating things that can happen to a thinking person is to he told this You would be much more forceful if you weren t so sure you knew it all How much time we all waste in vagueunthoughtful generalizations of this sortThe only person who really thinks heknows it allis that misguided soul who is always asking for advicealways giving adviceand eternally ignoring both that which he gives and which he receivesHe is as muddled as a clear pool that has been stirred up with a stickbut the ripples convince him that the stirring up has touched many shoresThe person to whom the stigma ofknowing it allis most often attached is he who believes that he knows something about himself and very little about anybody elseHe is that person who takes care of his own problems with a certain ardorwith a sense of keen clearnesslike the shining of a star through his deepunmuddled poolHe has realized Arnold s Self DependenceBut the muddled ones can never forgive him for that joy with which the stars perform their shiningnor can they ever understand the stupor of helplessness which descends upon him when he is asked to direct some one else s shiningThereforethey arguehe is self sufficient and the adjective is a curseSome one has saidquite untrulythat people never know the important things about themselvesBut the only thing in the world a man can really know is himself and it is his chief business to push self knowledge beyond its obvious boundaries to those reaches where even change becomes a comprehended elementThe gist of the whole matter is this People who know themselves are the only ones with whom we are wholly protected from that stupid and offensive practice of dictatorship alsothey are the only ones capable of receiving

phrase which might be called the Great American Excusethe public likes to be humbugged The showman referred directly to the amusement seeking publicand applied his half truth to that rural pageantthe circusbut it was an easy phraseit suited the purpose of men who were anxious to deceive and to mountebankand it was snapped upTodaywhen a man is caught with a shameful misrepresentation he laughs sheepishly and repeats that the public likes to be humbugged But does itWe are The Publicyou are The Publicand none of us likes to be hum buggedThen how is it that this proverbialism has gained such credence in this countryWe are a new peopleOur country is a great international whirlpool of ideasNew musicold musicnew theoriesold theoriesnew picturesold picturesnew standardsold standards meet here and are spun about us with hysteria like speed We do not want to appear ignorant of the newest thought or the oldest conventionWe strive for an impossible universalismand we accept many a mountebank at his face value because we are unable to settle his true worthimmediatelyand because we feel that we must give a decision immediately Our credulity is stretched almost to the breaking point every hour of every day of the yearfor wonders seem never to cease and the quality of the genuine has given rise to the quantity of the false We are gullible because we as a nation are alive to the possibility of the impossible We have gained a reputation for loving to be cheated because we have the almost national virtue of being able to losesmileand again striveBUT we do not love itAnd in the

Review The New York LetterGEORGE SOULEHE future of The Century is the engrossing topic among the writers and publishers in New YorkNo startling change in editorial policy is contemplatedPossibly the perception of the modern and future world which the magazine has begun to show under the guidance of MrYard will be more apparentThe principal topic for speculationhoweveris whether ahigh classillustrated magazine selling for thirty five cents can be a financial successor even self supportingIt is an open secret that none of them has been making money for some timeWith this question readers who are interested in the contents of The Century have no concern except the single rather important one that if present conditions continue long enough the magazine will cease to existat least in its present form Hereas in every other literary fieldthe strengthening of the machinery of commerce has enabled the product of transient popularity to interfere seriously with the thing that is done for its own sakeThelowbrowrulesAn illustrated magazine is made possible by its advertisingand the advertisers want large circulationSome of them doit is truelook also forqualityof circulationbut their standard of quality has nothing to do with tasteliterary or otherwise it measures merelyspending power And the aristocracy of intellect has only a shadowy identity with the aristocracy of wealthThere are thousands ofautomobile ownerswho would never think of wading through even an Atlantic Monthly article Are there enough people in the United States who will buy an ably editedhigh classmagazine to attract a profitable number of advertisersThat is the question which remains to be answeredA probable answer is that there may be enoughbut that it will be a herculean task to get them all buying the same magazineThe people who will pay thirty five cents for the privilege of reading literature of real thought and ideals are now pretty well divided into partiesranging all the way from old line republicans to anarchistsTwenty years ago we had a much more homogeneous culturepeople who had any consciousness of their minds were allied in their fundamental idealsIf an intelligent magazine prints anything vital nowit is bound to offend a large portion of its publicQuite possibly in ten more years there will be only two kinds of general magazines leftthose which are franklylowbrow and those which do not care for large profitsdepend on uncommercial writersand are manufactured so cheaply that they do not need much advertising in order to existMr The Little ReviewYard has a strong belief in the success of his attempt to prove the contraryIt will indeed be a glorious victory if without compromise The Century can weld together a largeintelligent public The plight of the theatres is strictly analogous to that of the magazinesThe moving pictures have wiped out their galleries and decimated their balconiesA well filled orchestra is not quite enough to support the usual productionThe managers have either capitulated to the films entirely by puttingmovieson their stagesor have attempted to get the deserters back by competing with the films through the use of cheapened dramaMelodramatic farcewith an abundance of actionis the only form of play which is not now a drug on the managerial marketThat isto be surea respectable form of amusementbut there are some of us who would like occasionally to see something elsePerhaps the little theatreslike the little reviewswill become our refugeSome of us believe that the managers who still stick to live actors would be better off if they would stop trying to compete with the moving picture on its own ground and produce solid work for which the legitimate stage is alone adaptedWe can substantiate our theory by the fact that at one time this spring nearly the only successful plays in New York were the revivals of Fitch s The Truth and Wilde s Lady Windermere s FanBut the temper of most managers and playwrights is not encouragingNot many days ago a group of successful writers were gathered for the week end at the house of a producerOne of them was reading a new manuscriptAnother interrupted him to say quite seriouslyThat s not rightold chapYou ought to get a laugh two thirds of the way down that page Whereupon the reader inserted ajokeabout a Ford car and an automobile There is a dangerhoweverin the little theatre ideaLittle theatres may grow to have the same sort of insincerestyleand disgusting appeal to social snobbery which are the characteristics of magazines like VogueAs in the case of the magazinesthe best thing that could happen would be the appearance of a genius of so much life and power that he could drive the crowds before him and produce his plays in the open air of real public appreciationThe coming of the moving picture has only aggravated a problem which was previously acuteThe crisis is here for that we must be grateful to the films and the cheap magazinesShall the rule of the people produce nothing better than a race of commercial craftsmen whose only thought is to make money by exploiting the least worthy instincts of the peopleOr shall we produce at least a few courageous leaders whospeaking out of their own authorityshall lead the people after themThe faithful canwhile they are waitingkeep alive the sacred fires and scan the horizon for the new prophetHis victory can comenot by compromisebut by aggressive power There is one growing form of drama which is genuine in its art and may become popular in its appeal the development of this is being care The Little Reviewfully watched by those who are alertIt is but a step from a moving picture such as D Annunzio s Cabiria to a spectacle such as Reinhardt s The MiracleThe latter is coming to us next winterMadison Square Garden will be its stageSheldon has written an unusual spectacle play which George Tyler will produceLet these things not be confused with such orgies of stage setting as The Garden of Allah it is quite possible to use the visual element as a principal means ofgetting overthe dramatic expression without doing so badlyTo condemn all such productions because some of them happen to be over realisticis to condemn all painting because of Meissonier May it not be that a great trouble of our drama has been the failure to recognize the fact that the picture is just as important an element of the stage as the dialogueEvery French actress receives a thorough training in pantomime in America anyone with a sensitive eye will squirm under the inept and ugly line compositions presented by our actresses in their gesturesAnd as for stage settingthe height of our ambition has seemed to be to get a door that will really slamor to fill the stage with pink appleblossomsthe audience will always applaud pinkThe resolution of these crude attempts into something that really makes a good appeal to the eye is no new thing but for a long time we have not been ready for the work of Reinhardt or Gordon Craig on the one side or of the Russian Ballet on the otherNow the moving pictures are at once educating our eyes to watch dramaand are undermining the support of old fashioned plays whichthrough their very excellent mediocrityprevented the encroachment of new ideasLet us go to the theatres next fall prepared to trace the beginnings of a new stage art in this country in the meantimehowevernot hoping to escape the flood of cheap and artistically vicious stuff with which the commercial managers and producers will attempt to drown our sensibilities There is more active charity in the egoism of a strenuousfar seeing soul than in the devotion of a soul that is helpless and blind MaeterlinckBook Discussion Gospel According to MooreAveby George Moore DAppleton and CompanyNew YorkMrGeorge Moore has finished his autobiographic triologyHail and Farewelland has shaken the dust of Ireland from his feetThe Celtic Renaissance must make its way without his help or hindranceHe camehe ponderedhe withdrewIn these astonishing volumes we have the whole story of his adventures and his thoughtsand an unrivalled series of impressionistic portraits of his friendsWe see Yeats in his long cloaklooking like a melancholy rook Lady Gregorythe poet s devoted disciple Edward Martyn and his soul Plunkett and Gillthe Bouvard and Pécuchet of real lifeA Ewho settles everybody s difficulties and consoles the afflicted Colonel Moorethe author s brother and we catch an occasional glimpse of Arthur SymonsSyngeJames Stephensand many othersBut the book is very different from the ordinary Sunlights and Shadows of My Short LifeIt is a remarkable piece of self portraiture and an explanation of the author s attitude toward art and the Christian religion It was during the composition of the stories contained in The Untitled Field that MrMoore came to realize that the Celt was but a herdsmanand that art had steadily declined in Ireland since the Irish Church was joined to RomeBut what was the reason for this declineWas it due to the race or to CatholicismMrMoore and his friends discussed this question at length and considered the history of literature in relation to the Roman Catholic ChurchTheir discoveries astonished himfor the case against Catholicism was even stronger than he had hoped for About two thousand years ago the Ecclesiastic started out to crush lifeandin three centuries humilityresignation and obedience were accepted as virtuesthe shrines of the gods were abandonedthe beautiful limbs of the lover and athlete were forbidden to the sculptor and the meagre thighs of dying saints were offered him insteadLiterature diedfor literature can but praise lifeMusic diedfor music can but praise lifeand the lugubrious Dies Irae was heard in the fanesWhat use had a world for art when the creed current among men was that life is a mean and miserable thingSo amid lugubrious chant and solemn processionthe dusk thickened until the moment of deepest night was reached in the ninthtenthand eleventh centuriesIn the fifteenth century the dawn began in Italyand sculptors and painters turned their eyes toward Greece Dante was a Catholicalthough not a very orthodox oneand Catholicism can make a valid claim to the cathedrals and the choral music of Vittoria and PalestrinaBut the painters of the Renaissance were as pagan as Caesar Borgia and only choseThe Little Reviewreligious subjects as a pretext for drawing and to meet a certain demandIn factthe whole spirit of the Renaissance was pagan and progressiveand a return to the Middle Ages was averted whenthat disagreeable monkSavonarola was burned at the stakeAfter this new birth came the Reformationresulting in the Council of Trentwhich forbade all speculation on the meaning and value of life and arrangedthe Catholic s journey from the cradle to the grave as carefully as any tour planned by that excellent firmMessrsCook and Sons As a result there has been practically no Catholic literature since that timeArt is but praise of lifeand it is only through the arts that we can praise lifeLife is a rose that withers in the iron fist of dogmaand it was France that forced open the deadly fingers of the Ecclesiastic and allowed the rose to bloom again DescartesRabelaisMontaigneVoltaireRousseauDiderotMontesquieuHugoBalzacGautierRenanTaineMerimeeGeorge SandFlaubertZolaand Maupassant are all agnosticsThe most important Christians are PascalRacineand Corneillewho wrote mere imitations of the Greek drama without any criticism of lifeand Verlainewho embraced the Church in an ecstasy more sensuous than religiousIn Germany there are GoetheSchillerHeineKantHegelSchopenhauerWagnerand Nietzscheno Catholics and mainly agnosticIn Russia we find the utterly unmoral Turgenev and Tolstoywho professed to be a Christianbutas MrMoore points outdid not believe in the Resurrection of the BodyIn Italy the main figure since the Reformation is an artist of todaythe pagan D AnnunzioIn Spain there is one great Catholic workDon Quixotebut it is completely unethicalAmong the ScandinaviansIbsenBjornsonand Strindberg are agnosticsIn England the main evidence for the defence is found in Popewho called himself a Christianbut wrote The Essay on Manand Cardinal Newmanwhoaccording to Carlylehad a brain like a half grown rabbitIn America there are HawthorneEmersonPoeand WhitmanProtestant and agnostic The reason for all this has been explained by MrMoore again and againIt lies in the fact that the Church has always preferred the obedient and poor in spirit to the courageous and the wiseReligion is strongest among ignorant and weak minded peopleand as far back as the book of Genesis we read of God s anger at the man and woman who ate of the forbidden fruit The two great enemies of religion are the desire to live and the desire to know and the whole tendency of art is to increase and strengthen these desiresAnother thing for which the Church is responsible is the present attitude toward loveMrMoore writes with pride ofthe noble and exalted world that must have existed before Christian doctrine caused men to look upon women with suspicion and bade them to think of angels instead He insists with Gautier that earth is as beautiful as heaven When he had decided that literature was incompatible with dogma MrMoore found himself in a decidedly unpleasant situationHe had changed the course of his life to take part in the Irish Renaissanceand now he realized that the Irish Renaissance was a mere bubbleThe whole history of the world showed that literature could not be produced in a Roman Catholic countryThe only thing for him to do was to leave Irelandbut in the meanwhile he felt that he must declare himself a ProtestantBetween art and religion there could be but one choice for him the religion must be changedIt is true that he had never acquiesced in any of the dogmas of the Catholic Churchbut he had been baptized in that Churchand he had always been considered a CatholicProtestantism seemed much preferablebecause Protestantism leaves the mind very nearly freeIn the Confessions of a Young Manhe had already expressed his prejudice in its favor Look at the nations that have clung to Catholicismstarving moonlighters and starving brigandsThe Protestant flag floats on every ocean breezethe Catholic banner hangs limp in the incensed silence of the Vatican And so MrMoore after several futile interviews with the Anglican priest wrote to The Irish Times announcing his change from the Church of Romeand began the composition of Hail and Farewell as the best means in his power to liberate his country

cadavers with outpouring bowels in which swarm enormous wormsThe Sunday visitors pass by Dante s head yawningbut wistfully crowd at the wax PlagueI confess this sceneat timesmakes me draw an analogy with Chekhov and Andreyev As a playwright Andreyev has utterly failed he lacks dramatic constraint and proportionHe puts into the mouths of his actors bombastic phrasesto the delight of the gallery

circumstanceswas the object of the dramaIt is the world old problemthe futility of man s struggles in the face of blind unreasoning fate that may at any moment overthrow his toy castlesPerhaps a Goethe might attempt to say something new on that subjector at least to put it in a new wayWith Andreyev the task proved to be notup to his shoulder as the Russians sayThe annoying pretentiousness of the play appears a hundred times more convex when on the stageI saw it once in thesymbolizedtheatre of MmeKommissarzhevskaya in StPetersburgand another time in the performance of the Moscow Artistic

at CamdenNJ from 1888 to the end of his life in 1892and that comradewho jotted down every wordhas scattered the resultant wheat through its own chaffThree of the eight volumes through which the mixture is to run have been published It is inevitable that inconsequential stuffsheer nonsense in instances should find its way into this morbidly complete story of the harvest years of Whitman s lifebut it is surprising how much personality and interpretative value lie hidden in some of his most commonplace utterancesA tremendous personality descends to occasional banality because of the inadequacy and commonness of wordsIt is too much to expect Whitman even to revitalize the vocabulary of a democracyBut great as he was as a cosmic voiceWhitman exhibited and confessed kinship with common clayIn factLeaves of Grass could never have grown out of an artificial soilinoculated with classic cultures it sprang as the first vegetation upon the surface of a wildprimal clayWhitman was first of all a bigmagnificent animal man he was secondarily a powerful poetic instrumentalitygiving sound and articulation to the wee smavoices exhaled by the earthThat is why the essence of his message was an appeal and a challenge to and an expression of democracy Of courseI do not mean the institutionalized democracy of politiciansfor no Jeffersonian goes to Whitman for solace when his faith is wobblingI mean the bio economic democracy that some of us believe in as a part of natural lawAs a man and as a poet Whitman was simplydaringlyand resolutely himselfHe had achieved a largestrong selfhood before Traubel began to Boswellize himand to that intimate friend he revealed in the languages of pentonguecountenanceand silence all the bigness and littleness that a long and intimate relationship could evokeIt would therefore be unfair to ascribe to Whitman all the sapless hay with which these three volumes are padded it is largely a product of mutual reactionsBut in relation to Traubel more than to any other personWhitman was consistentlyhabituallyand subconsciously himselfand the result is that this discursiveuneditedstoryof the poet s life and work will live as the most personal and valuable revealment of his characterIt is the last word about him as a manWhitman the poet effected his supreme expression in the poem beginning with the words I celebrate myself Other features which giveThe Little Reviewpermanent distinction to these volumes are the letters to Whitman from noted men and women in America and Great Britainand numerous portraits of himself and some of his friends Despite the fact that this work is padded with arid minutsewhich I should be the last person to abridgeevery page is interesting to readers of Whitman and students of American literatureThe first page of the first volumefor examplecontains an allusion to Emerson s senility that is worth readingin Whitman s wordsReading at random in the third volume I found this striking quotationBreaking loose is the thing to do breaking looseresenting the bondsopening new ways but when a fellow breaks loose or starts to or even only thinks he thinks he ll revolthe should be quite sure he knows what he has undertakenI expected hell I got it nothing that has occurred to me was a surprise Turning back a hundred pages I found thisI have always had an idea that I should some day move offbe alone finish my life in isolation This is the thought of the natural man who would die like a manOne could quote indefinitely from this extraordinary autobiography of the most outstanding figure in American literature DEWITT CWINGMidstreamMidstreamby Will Levington Comfort George HDoran CompanyNew YorkA directbig thingso simple that almost no one has done it before this MrComfort has daredHe gives us the story of his own life to the mid way markIt is not an autobiographyone of those deferential veilings of trutha blinding of the spectator by the scattering of fact dustAfter reading it one does not remember clearly the author s various removals from Detroit to other centers of activity one remembers the vital events in his consciousnessthe shamestriumphsand searchings of his body and soulHere is a man s life laid absolutely bare There is no use in explaining the value of such a book to those who do not admit itPeople to whom reserve is more important than truth people who are made uncomfortable by intimate grasp of anythingthese will not read Midstream through The others will see here a chance to understandAnd they will emerge from the book with a sense of the absolute nobility of MrComfort s franknessIf a thousand writers should give us such books we should understand better the much befogged basis of all human problems human nature Every man draws his own conclusions about vital matters from just such introspection as thiswhether it be conscious or unconsciousBut every man does not have the candor and the hard won insight of the trained writer It would be possible to enter into futile discussions about theartisticvalue of such a bookwhether naturalism can give us as fine a work as imaginationWhatever might be the result of such a discussionMrComfort s book remains interestingand interest is the first value of any written workHe is neither a Wilde nor a Turgenevbut he is a true writer To recapitulate the adventures of the sensitive and often unwholesome boythe degradations and victories of the young newspaper reporterthe soldierthe war correspondentthe husbandand the writerwould be to undermine the novel itselfIf you want to experience themlet MrComfort be the narrator It may not be out of placehoweverto quote a few of the conclusionsin order to give a taste of the book s directionThis of manA man is clean aloneif he is clean at allIt isn t being superman to learn to listen to the real selfjust the beginnings of manhood proper This of publishers and the publicIn manynot alleditorial officesthe producer is paid well and swiftly alone for that which is commonin which plots are picturedand all but greedy imagination put to death I saw that it was not enough for me to get down to the parlance of menbut to leave all hope behindnot only possible intellectual authority butby all meansany spiritual in sightthat only frankdown writingwould do This of woman s status The soul of woman dies if it may not sometimes aspireA periodic possession of devils on a man s part will not break the waiting quiescence of his womanbut the sordid routine of downtown methods will set her into screaming destruction at the lastThe creature who eight times the year obeys the tradesmen s instinct for style who has broken her bearing with centuries of clothes bondagefed her brain upon man s ideas of sexher body upon food bought for her and prepared by people whom she does not respect who has not yet heard the end of a dollar discussion begun when her baby ears first noted sounds who holds in shame all that is mighty in her geniusand who has finally accepted as a mate one of her male familiarsshe is a man made creaturein whom is buried a womanShe is man s ignorance and effrontery incarnatethe victim of his mania for material proprietieswhichfrom the beginninghave utterly desecrated spiritual truth And this of the futureBy every observationlaw and analogy in lifethe constructive purpose at work in the world is toward the end of the increase of spiritual receptivity in every creaturea continual heightening vibration toward the key rhythmGS The Little ReviewSonnets from the Patagonianby Donald Evans Claire MarieNew YorkIt has become the fashioneven among intelligent peopleto fling tawdry sneers at something not understoodespecially the intensely grotesqueThe indulgent smile has disappearedand the little peevish joke has taken its placePerhaps this is obviousbut some obvious things cannot be made too obvious Sonnets from the Patagonian is a type of book which will be almost universally laughed atYet it is something like a gold nuggetone must use his mind as a pick with which to isolate streaks of poetry from the coarse rockThe rock is simply grotesquenessThe gold is protesqueness mixed with unconscious simplicity I took out my pick one night and started the mental manual laborAt the end I had extracted six of the most startlingclutchingbeautiful lines of verse ever written in EnglishPerhaps the twisted dreariness of their surroundings made them stand out more vividlygave them a false value to meI shall let the reader judge And life was just an orchid that was dead Her hidden smile was full of little breasts Gnawed by the mirage of an opening night And a fawn colored laugh sucks in the night And like peach blossoms blown across the wind Her white words made the hour seem cool and kind Six lines almost lost in the mirage the poet speaks offbut well worth findingMB Patriotism is a superstition artificially created and maintained through a net work of lies and falsehoods a superstition that robs man of his self respect and dignityand increases his arrogance and self conceit Emma GoldmanThe Reader CriticEmma GoldmanLos Angeles Readers have a legitimate interest in the truth of critical articlesWe therefore believe they will welcome these comments by Miss Goldman on the article about herselfIf Miss Goldman had been displeasedwe should haze printed her letter with equal frankness A Chicago friend sent me TH E LITTLE REVIEW for Maywhich contains your very excellent article on The Challenge of Emma GoldmanI cannot begin to tell you how much I appreciate what you have to say about my work and myselfnot because of your sympathetic interpretation but because of your deep grasp of the purpose which is urging my work and permeating my lifeI hope you will not mistake it as conceit on my part when I tell you that more has been written about me than perhaps about any other woman in this countrybut that most of it has been trashThe only person who came near the fundamental urge in my personality was William Marion Reedy of The StLouis Mirrorwho wrote The Daughter of the DreamI do not know whether you have ever seen itbut even his splendid write up does not compare with yoursbecause it contains much more flattery than understandingYou canthereforeimagine my joy in finding that it was a woman who demonstrated so much depth and appreciation of the cardinal principles in my work HG New York It s getting banal for me to praise the magazineI m sorrybut I can t help itThe thing has assumed the nervous importance to me of an emotional experience foreseen and inevitableAnd now that I ve finished reading the June issue I can truthfully say there isn t a line in it I wouldn t have been poorer withoutThat couldn t be said of any other magazine ever published Your Juneleaderis not only true and bigbut absolutely timely The essentially immoral thing should be the thing which does not contribute in some wayhowever obscureto the main currentYou call itwaste The reason vice is disgusting is because it turns human stuff off into an inescapable pocketMy idea is a sort of spiritual utilitarianismyou seeYet without the flat associations of utilitarianism because it recognizes so many things as means to the endjoy and pain and rebellionfor instance DrFostersarticle is superb The fallacy of all ethical systems is that they set up an abstract word as a virtue under all conditions Unselfishness for instanceSometimes a fine virtuesometimes notaccording to circumstancesWe must decidenot the rigid wordAlmost all present day fallacies proceed from a failure to recognize the fact that the world is fluidThe individual is worthless except for his dynamicThe staticviceleads to deathdeath is merely disorganization of the individualso that life may be cast in new forms better fitted to proceed WM New York I am reading TH E LITTLE REVIEW month by month with much interestand have found many tilings that gave me pleasureI admire the intellectual standardThere is plenty of goodearnest thought in each issueI should likehoweverto see a little more of whatfor want of a better wordI termhuman TH E REVIEW is still in the colder currents of intellectualismI think it can stand a little more warm feelingeven if you get it in the way of a controversy The Little Review 55FRII New York I am distinctly of the opinion that THE LITTLE REVIEW is worth whileIt is one of the very few periodicals I read through from cover to coverIf this can be made to go it will be a greater triumph for the American people than for youSo many magazines of this type have been based upon unsound premisesThey have become the vehicle for irrepressible self expressionthey have followed freak paths of every varietythey have turned Pegasus into a mechanical hydro aeroplane and have flattered themselves thatIcarus likethey were scaling the summits to the sky and endangering their pinions near the sunwhenas a matter of factthey were plunging through the sloughs below and the only evidence of the sun was its reflection upon the mud by which they were surroundedWith THE LITTLE REVIEWhoweverI have a fine sense of clarity FD New York Not long ago I wrote you a longlong letter about TH E LITTLE REVIEWBut I didn t send itbecause who am I to dogmatize about criticismAnywayI was severe upon youbecause I was disappointedI really don t think TH E LITTLE REVIEW is critical at allIt is exuberantly uncriticalenthusiastic about the wrong thingsBut you will probably get tired of just being enthusiastic after a timeand start in to criticiseI m sorry I don t like it betterIt has had some good things in itWhat I principally object to is your own editorial attitude Constance SkinnerNew York I have just read your first issue and want to send my godspeed to this magazine that feelsI am so sick of callousness and sneers and flippancy Your Paderewski article touches me nearlyShall I send you a brief little picture of Paderewski

wonderful eyes ever madewas something I could not look away fromShe added Poland is not dead while Poles can weepWe must bless griefit has given us our art HGS Chicago I am going to ask you to please discontinue my subscription to THE LITTLE REVIEWas your ideas which you set forth in your leading articles are so entirely crude and so vastly different from my own that I do not care to be responsible for its appearance in my home any longerThis reader has the honor of sending in the first cancellationWe might take his denunciation more seriously if it were not for our suspicion that what he really meant to say was this Your ideas are entirely crude because so vastly different from my ownThe EditorThe following is typical of the older generation s response to the new orderIt is a perfectly consistent lettera perfectly sincere oneand a perfectly impossible oneBut it is not to be taken so lightly as it deservesfirstbecause it has all the poison the younger generation hates mostsecondbecause its perplexities are perfectly natural onesand thirdbecause educationin order really to be effectivemust begin upon just such attitudesIt may be as well to answer at least one of the writer s arguments by quoting ShawIn his new prefacein a chapter called The Risks of Ignorance and Weaknesshe says very neatly The difficulty with children is that they need protection from risks they are too young to understandand attacks they can neither avoid nor desistYou may on academic grounds allow a child to snatch glowing coals from the fire onceYou will not do it twiceThe risks of liberty we must let everyone takebut the risks of ignorance and self helplessness are another matterNot only children but adults need protection from them Following the mothersletter is one from a boy which ought to throw some light on the subject from the young generation s standpoint Margaret PixleeIndianapolisI feel impelled to reply to your article entitled The Renaissance of ParenthoodI wonder what could have been the home life of such a girl as you quote fromthat she should write that kind of a letterShaw says there is nothing so futile or so stupid as to try to control your children Your opinion that Shaw s ideas aregloriousshows at once that you have only touched the surface of what motherhood isCan you honestly believe that a parent is doing his duty if he allows a child to rush in front of a moving automobile attracted by the bright lightsknowing nothing of the danger aheadwhich certainly would mean death if the child had its own wayIrrespective of what Shaw or Ellen Key writeit is the parentsabsolute duty to train and educate a child until he is capable of using his own reasoning powersAndtoothere is but one wayPrinciple and Truth with Love and Charity are the only wayLet me here quote from your article on Emma GoldmanIf you do not agree with Emma Goldmanyou say in effectlet us at least be broadminded and see both sidesBut are you doing thisFrom my point of viewyou seem to take the side only of free thinkingandas you call itindependent thoughtThere is no independent thoughtexcept doing rightI can see your point of viewAs we look about us among the people of the social worldmany are indeed selling their children in marriage to some man for the petty consideration of high social position and moneyMany times when an engagement is announced the first question is how well off is the maninstead of what are his principles and is he worthy of the girlThese poor children are indeed the offspring of foolish parentsand are to be pitiedIf as they advance on life s highway they are given to see what principle meansthen is it right to separate and go their own wayWe all must develop the spiritual withinbut to break loose from home tiesas this girl seems to desirefrom selfishness alonewill lead to a worse death than that of being crushed by the automobileI haveThe Little Review 57admitted that to sell a child in wedlock to a man whose only attraction is a fat bank account and social position is crime of the blackestBut taking the other course is equally as badfor passionate love is always selfish and soon burns outLet us consider for one moment a child born out of wedlockAs I understand itso called free thinkers consider this rightThey disregard the lawand honestly think they have done a fine thing All for love and the world well lost A daughter is bornand from some remote ancestor she inherits a love of the conventionalCan you picture to yourself what the suffering would be to see the daughter you love an outcast always from the things she cares for through what you call the grand passion nothing more or less than the supreme selfishness of two human beingsno matter what you and the girl you are privileged to quote fromthink you believe It will not be possible to do the deeds you write about as they are portrayed by free thinkersTruth will be revealed to your innermost selfYou cannot do otherwise than follow the Divine Revelationwhich alone leads to real happinessfor all material pleasures are swept away sooner or laterA boy readerChicago In the preface of his latest Quintessence of IbsenismShaw expresses his astonishment that the book changed peoplesmindsHe has perhaps by now collected abundant evidence that his books really have changed peoplesminds and whole life coursesWhat wouldperhapsbe more astonishing to him is the fact that the first hearing of one of his plays did itand without the aid of a preface Fanny s First Play started me thinking about family relationshipLong before the play was publishedwith the lengthy preface on parents and childrenthe very things he advises were happeningThe preface was undoubtedly written after long contemplation of the playas was my action proving that the generalizations he makes are not as impossible or absurd as the family egotist so pathetically argues I do not doubt that this playthe beginning of my knowledge of Shawwas the most important event of my youthIt isof coursemost important as a woman s playbut why Margaret Knox s revolt could not be mine I do not see The family in which I was beingbrought upwas all that Shaw says the present day family isand worsefor there were also brothers and a sister to aid in thebringing up These were all brought up in dutiful submission to mother s influence and father s careThey hadarrivedor gone just as far as they ever thought of going just as I was starting for my goalTheir present condition had received parental commendation but what I sawon looking about memade me shudder and thinkI would find out the reason for their condition and see if their fate was to be mineOf one thing I was certain iffamily dutyorfilial pietywere responsible for the state of things I would have none of itand I said soYou ll seeyou ll bump your head some day you ll see what good it does to have foolish visions or dreamsyou just do what you re told and you ll be better offMother and father know more than youthey re older All this I had patronizingly handed out to meSomehow all this was horrible to methis idea of contemplating a future such as theirsa colorless life built ondoing what you re toldand nothaving foolish dreams For it struck me as an existence that mocked the very system that was responsible for itThe only thing by which I could judge the worth of the advice was the finished result Of course when I presented my case to my parents I was met with that attitude always displayed toward youthful self assertionTo make my case clear to their somewhat bewildered minds I drew up a list of grievancesthere were thirty three concrete faults in the existing order that must be stamped out or radically changed They fell into four groupsForemost was my education there were ten in that58 The Little Reviewgroupall as unintelligent and old as thinking that a city grammar school education was enough for any boyAs soon as I was old enough to work it would be useless to educate myself any furtherI wouldn t need it any wayIt would be wasting time that should be spent in learning a tradeThey had decided that thebuilding linewas the safest to work in and therefore I must become a bricklayer or a carpenter or something thatpays good That I should have some say as to what I should take up for life they thought foolishI would only pick out something that wouldn t bring enough salary Look at your big brotherhe s got a nice steady job as a mailman he didn t need any extraexpensive schoolingNext were my religious and spiritual idealsThere were four in that groupThey were quite as dogmatic in theirthou must notsas those in the church ritual they wished us to believe explicitlySuperstition played a big part in the religion they wanted us to believeTheirs was a Sunday religionandnot practicing it themselvesit was absurd for them to ask our respect on that score Economically they were quite positive that only they were capable of taking care of thingsWe were not able to spend our own money in a sensible way and were not to be trusted with deciding what should be done with what was saved or earnedAs to their ideas on the subjectthere were six ways in which I showed them where I differed The longest and most significant group was that dealing with the way things were being run in the homeMethods that were retarding my growthmentally and physicallyThere were thirteen of themeach with their minor detailssuch as the oneMy Room Without being meanly selfish I asked for at least a little privacy while studying or at sleep that the room not be used as a wardrobe for quite the entire familyand that I be allowed to take care of itas to arrangementdecorationsand airingWhich last word reminds me that their ideas of hygiene were quite antiquatedand must be changed and enlarged uponAbsurd as it may seemthey still insisted that night air was dangerous that one toweltooth brushbar of soapand brush and comb were enough for one familythose I got for my personal use were immediately appropriated by the rest of the familythat too much bathing is dangerous and as for swimmingmother heard of a boy drowning with the cramps when she was a girltherefor her son must not go near the waterthat exercising isnonsense that menus must contain meat and numerous other heavy foods at every mealand that childrenno matter how youngare able to digest whatever adults canThese are a few instances of parental ideas that were useless so far as I was concernedWas a rebellion necessaryIt was in my case and I may as well add that it has already had resultsto give the details wouldI fearbe getting too personalI have been so alreadyperhapsbut it may induce those who called the Preface absurd to read it againThe Little Review 59The ForerunnerA Monthly Magazine 1 00 a
