KINGS  WE RIDE but slowly though so near our home King Eochaid said and he that bore his shield Sighing replied What need have we  for haste Towards the hour for speaking of the dead My married sister put into my care A boy of twenty years a mound and stone Between the wood of Duras and Magai Have been the measure of that care But Eochaid Having no thought but for his queen Edain Outrode his troop that after twelve months war Toiled with empounded cattle through the mire And came into a wood as the sun set Westward of Tara Where in the middle wood A clump of beech trees made an empty space He thought to have given his horse the spur but saw  Eochaid is pronounced Yohee   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Between the pale green light of the beech leaves  And the ground ivy s bluer light a stag  Whiter than curds its eyes the tint of the sea Because it stood upon his path and seemed  More hands in height than any stag in the world  He sat with tightened rein amazed his horse  Trembling beneath him and then drove the spur  Not doubting to have shouldered it away But the stag stooped its heavy branching horns  And ran at him and passed and as it passed  Ripped through the horse s flanks King Eochaid reeled But drew his sword and thought with levelled point  To stay the stag s next rush When sword met horn  The horn resounded as though it had been silver  Horn locked in sword they tugged and struggled there  As though a stag and unicorn were met In Africa on mountain of the moon  Until at last the unlocked horn had torn  Through the entrails of the horse Dropping his sword Eochaid seized both the horns in his strong hands  And stared into the sea green eyes and so Hither and thither to and fro they trod  Till all the place was beaten into mire  The strong thigh and the agile thigh were met  The hands that gathered up the might of the world  And hoof and horn that had sucked in their speed  Amid the elaborate wilderness of the air   The Two Kings  Through bush they plunged and over ivied root And where the stone struck fire while in the leaves A squirrel whinnied and a bird screamed out But when at last he forced those sinewy flanks Against a beech bole he threw down the beast And knelt above it with drawn knife On the instant It vanished like a shadow and a cry So mournful that it seemed the cry of one Who had lost some unimaginable treasure Wandered between the blue and the green leaf And climbed into the air crumbling away Till all had seemed a shadow or a vision  But for the trodden mire the pool of blood The disembowelled horse King Eochaid gazed And then as terror stricken as a child Who has seen a garden image or twisted tree In the half light and runs to its own door Its terror growing wilder at every foot fall He ran towards the house his fathers built On peopled Tara nor stood to draw his breath Until he came before the painted wall The posts of polished yew circled with bronze Of the great door but though the hanging lamps Showed their faint light through the unshuttered windows Nor door nor mouth nor slipper made a noise Nor on the ancient beaten paths that wound From well side or from plough land was their noise   And there had been no sound of living thing Before him or behind but that far off On the horizon edge bellowed the herds Knowing that silence brings no good to kings And mocks returning victory he passed Between the pillars with a beating heart And saw where in the midst of the great hall Pale faced alone upon a bench his wife Sat upright with a sword before her feet A kind mild woman had she been who poured Her beauty as the constellations pour Their richness through the summer and the spring But now she had no mild and no kind look Her hands on either side had gripped the bench Her eyes were cold and steady her lips tight Some passion had made her stone Hearing a foot She started and then knew whose foot it was But when he thought to take her in his arms She motioned him afar and rose and spoke I have sent out into the fields and woods The fighting men and servants of this house For I would have your judgment upon one Who is self accused If she be innocent She would not look in any known man s face Till judgment has been given and if guilty Because that were a guilt against her king Will never look again on known man s face   The Two Kings  And at these words he paled as she had paled Knowing that he should find upon her lips The meaning of that monstrous day  Then she You brought me where your brother Ardan sat Always in his one seat and bid me care him Through that strange illness that had fixed him there And should he die to heap his burial mound And raise his pillar stone King Eochaid said Gazing upon her with bewildered eyes If he be living still the whole world s mine But if not living half the world is lost I bid them make his bed under this roof And carried him his food with my own hands And so the weeks passed by But when I said What is this trouble he would answer nothing Though always at my words his trouble grew And I that I might find and stub it out But asked the more until he spoke these words Weary of many questions There are things That make the heart akin to the dumb stone Then I replied Although you hide a secret Dearer than any that the dumb stone hides Speak it that I may send through the wide world For medicine Thereon he cried aloud Day after day you question me and I Because there is such a storm amid my thoughts I shall be carried in the gust command   Forbid beseech and waste my breath Then I Although the thing that you have hid were evil The speaking of it could be no great wrong And evil must it be if done twere worse Than mound and stone that keep all virtue in And loosen on us dreams that waste our life Shadows and shows that can but turn the brain But finding him still silent I stooped down And whispering that none but he should hear Said If a woman has put this on you My men whether it please her or displease And though they have to cross the Loughlan seas And take her in the middle of armed men Shall make her look upon her handiwork That she may quench the rick she has fired and though She may have worn silk clothes or worn a crown She ll not be proud knowing within her heart That our sufficient portion of the world Is that we give although it be brief giving Happiness to children and to men Then he driven by his thought beyond his thought And speaking what he would not though he would Sighed You even you yourself could work the cure And at those words I rose and I went out And for nine days he had food from other hands And for nine days my mind went whirling round The one disastrous zodiac muttering  that the immedicable wound s beyond   The Two Kings  Question of ours beyond our pity even But when nine days had gone I stood again Before his chair and bending down my head Told him that when Orion rose and all The women of his household were asleep To go for hope would give his limbs the power To an old empty woodman s house that s hidden Close to a clump of beech trees in the wood Westward of Tara there to await a friend That could as he had told her work his cure And would be no harsh friend  When night had deepened I groped my way through boughs and over roots Till oak and hazel ceased and beech began And found the house a sputtering torch within And stretched out sleeping on a pile of skins Ardan and though I called to him and tried To shake him out of sleep I could not rouse him I waited till the night was on the turn Then fearing that some labourer on his way To plough or pasture land might see me there Went out  Among the ivy covered rocks As on the blue light of a sword a man Who had unnatural majesty and eyes Like the eyes of some great kite scouring the woods Stood on mv path Trembling from hand to foot I gazed at him like grouse upon a kite   But with a voice that had unnatural music A weary wooing and a long he said Speaking of love through other lips and looking Under an alien eyelid for it was my craft That put a passion in the sleeper there And when I had got my will and drawn you here Where I may speak to you alone my craft Sucked up the passion out of him again And left mere sleep He ll wake when the sun wakes Push out his vigorous limbs and rub his eyes And wonder what has ailed him these twelve months I cowered back upon the wall in terror But that sweet sounding voice ran on Woman I was your husband when you rode the air Danced in the whirling foam and in the dust In days you have not kept in memory Being betrayed into a cradle and I come That I may claim you as my wife again I was no longer terrified his voice Had half wakened some old memory Yet answered him I am King Eochaid s wife And with him have found every happiness Women can find With a most burning voice  That made the body seem as it were a string Under a bow he cried What happiness Can lovers have that know their happiness Must end at the dumb stone but where we build Our sudden palaces in the still air   The Two Kings  Pleasure itself can bring no weariness Nor can time waste the cheek nor is there foot That has grown weary of the whirling dance Nor an unlaughing mouth but mine that mourns Among those mouths that sing their sweethearts praise Your empty bed How should I love I answered Were it not that when the dawn has lit my bed And shown my husband sleeping there I have sighed Your strength and nobleness will pass away Or how should love be worth its pains were it not That when he has fallen asleep within my arms Being wearied out I love in man the child What can they know of love that do not know She builds her nest upon a narrow ledge Above a windy precipice Then he Seeing that when you come to the death bed You must return whether you would or no This human life blotted from memory Why must I live some thirty forty years Alone with all this useless happiness Thereon he seized me in his arms but I Thrust him away with both my hands and cried Never will I believe there s any change Can blot out of my memory this life Sweetened by death but if I could believe  That were a double hunger on my lips For what is doubly brief But now the shape   My hands were pressed to vanished suddenly I staggered but a beech tree stayed ray fall And clinging to it I could hear the cocks Crow upon Tara  She had fixed her eyes Upon Kind Eochaid s face who lowered his face And touched her forehead with his lips and said I thank you for your kindness to my brother And for the love that you have shown your king For that you promised and for that refused  Thereon the bellowing of the empounded herds Rose round the walls and through the bronze ringed door Jostled and shouted those war wasted men And in the midst King Eochaid s brother stood He d heard that din on the horizon s edge And ridden out to welcome them and now Giving his hand to that man and to this Praised their great victories and gave them joy Of their return to that ancestral house  William Butler Yeats   INDIAN SUMMER  After completing a book for one now dead  O Earth and Autumn of the Setting Sun She is not by to know my task is done  In the brown grasses slanting with the wind Lone as a lad whose dog s no longer near Lone as a mother whose only child has sinned Lone on the loved hill and below me here The thistle down in tremulous atmosphere Along red clusters of the sumach streams The shrivelled stalks of goldenrod are sere And crisp and white their flashing old racemes  forever forever forever This is the lonely season of the year This is the season of our lonely dreams  0 Earth and Autumn of the Setting Sun She is not by to know my task is done  The corn shocks westward on the stubble plain Show like an Indian village of dead days The long smoke trails behind the crawling train And floats atop the distant woods ablaze With orange crimson purple The low haze Dims the scarped bluffs above the inland sea Whose wide and slaty waters in cold glaze Await yon full moon of the night to be  far and far and far    These are the solemn horizons of man s ways These the horizons of solemn thought to me  0 Earth and Autumn of the Setting Sun She is not by to know my task is done  And this the hill she visited as friend And this the hill she lingered on as bride Down in the yellow valley is the end They laid her in no evening Autumn tide Under fresh flowers of that May morn beside The queens and cave women of ancient earth   This is the hill and over my city s towers Across the world from sunset yonder in air Shines through its scaffoldings a civic dome Of piled masonry which shall be ours To give completed to our children there And yonder far roof of my abandoned home Shall house new laughter Yet I tried I tried And ever wistful of the doom to come I built her many a fire for love for mirth When snows were falling on our oaks outside Dear many a winter fire upon the hearth  farewell farewell farewell We dare not think too long on those who died While still so many yet must come to birth  William Ellery Leonard   TO A MOCKING BIRD  0 Singer of the twilight solitude When moss veiled oaks sigh at my weary dream Beside the sullen heron haunted stream Thy laughing voice begins its gay prelude Mocking the boding owl with mimic scream Then o er the hushed lagoon the night mists brood Till sudden throbbing with beatitude Rises thy vesper hymn of love supreme No old world myth no tragic love refrain Dost thou to everglade and bayou tell So joyous is thy high exulting strain My sad heart wakes to hope beneath the spell Faint grows the memory of passion s pain Forgotten is the song of Philomel  Owen F Aldis   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SEA AND LAND  An ocean wind came in at break of day I saw it span the level water floor And gain the bare hills of a listless shore That in the yellow sunlight waiting lay I saw the blue sea coming o er the gray As sweeps across a life unstirred before A breath of new creation evermore To blow in fresher currents on its way On came the breeze its forward gusts outflung Fanwise in eager haste to reach the strand And oh the sweetness of the first breath drawn It is a common thing but seldom sung This blessed meeting of the sea and land The great sea freshening of the world at dawn  Herbert J Hall    AN AEROPLANE AT STONEHENGE  We stood at Stonehenge as the evening fell A mist had gathered and the reddened sun Glowed like an altar fire upon the edge Of Salisbury Plain The aged stones To whom our thousand years of fear and hope Of war and peace were but as yesterday Merged into the shadows The solemn night The mystery the burden of gray Time Awed us to silence And then from the heart Of that age wonted stilness sprang and grew  The iterant throbbing of an aeroplane And over our Druid world the marvel sped And vanished  With the breaking of the spell Our thought turned to the gradual perfecting Of this the century s new gift to man With all its ruthless toll of human life And suddenly the place in which we stood Grew peopled with strange forms A priest was there With naked blade and prone before him lay A victim on whose pallid face was writ The passion of a willing sacrifice And spirit unto shrouded spirit spake I give ye gain but shall it always be That life must take its wage of life and men Must die that Man may win the goal he seeks   And as we turned away the mighty stones Seemed dumbly questioning the quiet stars  Edmund Kemper Broadus  TO THEE  White foam flower red flame flower  On my tree of delight Lean from the shadow Like singing in sorrow Pale flower of thy smile flame flower of thy touch  In my night  CAPRICE  Who will be naming the wind That lifts me and leaves me Swelleth my budding flame Foully bereaves me From the land whose forgotten name Man shall not find Blowest thou wind  Clara Shanafelt    THE OLD HOME  They ve torn the old house down that stood Like some kind mother in this place Hugged by its orchard and its wood Two sturdy children strong of race  The shrubs which snowed their blossoms on The walks wide stretching from its doors Like friendly arms are dead and gone And over all a grand house soars  Within its front no welcome lies But pride s aloofness wealth that stares From windows cold as haughty eyes The arrogance of new made heirs  Its very flowers breathe of cast And even the Springtide seems estranged In that stiff garden caught held fast All her wild beauty trimmed and changed  T is not the Spring that once I knew Who made a glory of her face And robed in shimmering light and dew Moved to wild music in this place   How fair she walked here with her Hours Pouring out colors and perfumes And with her bosom heaped with flowers Climbed by the rose vines to its rooms  Or round the old porch mid the trees Fluttered a flute of bluebird song Or murmuring with a myriad bees Drowsed in the garden all day long  How Summer with her apron full Of manna shook the red peach down Or stretched among the shadows cool Wove for her hair a daisy crown  Or with her crickets night and day Gossiped of many a fairy thing Her sweet breath warm with scents of hay And honey purple blossoming  How Autumn trailing tattered gold And scarlet in the orchard mused And of the old trees taking hold Upon the sward their ripeness bruised  Or past its sunset window panes Like thoughts that drift before old eyes   The Old Home  Whirled red leaves and the ragged rains And crows black blown about the skies  How Winter huddled in her hood Of snow and sleet crouched by its flues Or rushing from the stormy wood Rapped at its doors with windy news   It lived The house was part of us It was not merely wood and stone But had a soul a heart that thus Grappled and made us all its own  The lives that with its life were knit In some strange way beyond the sense Had gradually given to it A look of old experience  A look which I shall not forget No matter where my ways may roam I close my eyes I see it yet The old house that was once my home  Madison Cawein   WANDER SONG  I pass with Time from place to place Like Time return no more Always a new immortal face To greet me at the door  Friends alter not nor love grows cold No change in life is rung For me the old were always old The young are always young  I pass with Time from place to place Like Time return no more Always a new immortal face To greet me at the door  ALONE  I walk the streets restless unknown Then back to this one room alone I turn and fret in aimless quest And fruitless yearnings unexpressed I curse the silence of the years And life long worries grow to fears And fierce regrets none understands Feeling my life slip through my hands   QUATRAINS  GOD SAID God said The hero s part to play it The flowers of life the good of ill Are yours if you but say I will  And do you know I could not say it TO THE SPHINX O Spirit of the Changeless Past What think st thou of our present state Thou look st quite through us and beyond The eyes of Death gazing at Fate LIBERTY A thousand years ago begun The fight for liberty A thousand battles have been won And still we are not free LIMITATIONS We look through telescopes to see Infinity And with the blocks of time build up Eternity FEAR Fear gave the antelope its speed The bird its wings And half the world is saved by flight And fear of things   THE FAITHFUL As the kneeling Mussulman To Mecca turns to pray So my heart dear turns to thee And never turns away  TO KNOW AND NOT TO KNOW Not to know is Hate That in cruelty wreaks its fears To know is Love And Pity is Love in tears  THE DESERT  Stricken by the hand of Fate All things motionless await The rain that never comes no hope In cloudless skies Far westward slope Low bastioned hills without a tree Dead guarding some dread mystery  The land lies far in weary miles Under the sun across the sands An aromatic scent beguiles Of sage sole plant in arid lands From desert floors wind swept arise Dust clouds like smoke unto the skies  Alfred Hitch  EDITORIAL COMMENT  OUR MODERN EPIC  NE who goes to Panama with eyes not too  narrowly focused must see in the making  of the Canal the proportions of a great  myth Prometheus the fire bringer Ulys  ses the wanderer Siegfried the dragon slayer are not more typical of humanity in heroic action and heroic hope than this modern piercing of the Isthmus And as truly as the heroes of myth were dreamers surrounded by magic and mystery who must exert their little human strength in league with the gods so do these modern adventurers reach out into the unknown with their diabolically perfect tools making not only a waterpath for ships but a new highway for the fate of nations  Even in our wide stretching centre of the continent where Atlantic and Pacific are three thousand miles apart the effort to bring them together carries a certain poetic glamor But as one escapes from under the New York skyscrapers and sails southward into tropic seas the poem grows in dignity finally culminating in epic grandeur in the presence of the work itself On the boat there are always people whose talk opens unknown lands A Yankee banana planter a Peruvian mining engineer the New York president of an Ecuador railroad through   the experiences of such as these South America emerges from the map to take significant and aggressive life life which must dominate some future era and the Central Americas with Mexico as well act out an immediate melodrama staged by certain familiar Interests who under the pressure of government control are beginning to find life too dull in the United States All these countries to the south hitherto abstractions to most of us Europe wanderers are suddenly full of events and big with potentialities We behold destiny stretching her long arm southward from the chosen seat of our security and Our Canal becomes the focal point in the politics of the coming age  And then Panama the ridiculous little republic which by a twist of Roosevelt s wrist rose to the honor of providing a background for our epic Colon and Panama the drowsy little palm fanned African peopled villages between which from ocean to ocean the Colossus stretches its stern length The contrast strikes a note of grotesque humor in the poem records the abysmal absurdity of human ambition And the delicate blue ripple of hills along the horizon the tangle of green jungles at one s feet the serene beauty of Gatun Lake which is spreading over half the Isthmus as if by a happy afterthought of Nature these are fine details each worthy of a perfect phrase   Our Modern Epic  Thus the pilgrim is adequately prepared In his imagination the project has won strange aspects far vistas before he follows the flight of locks at Gatun or climbs out of the new gorge and up the ancient hill at Culebra If he is wise he talks with everyone he meets rivetters concrete mixers wire stringers commissary clerks steam shovellers fighting slides physicians fighting microbes designers planning new terminal towns and the big chief himself whom all these others adore with an almost feudal loyalty In their smiling faces and eager voices he recognizes the old spirit of derring do here for the moment he finds the frontier of the world The adventurous the imaginative are here writing our modern epic of peace with heavier tools than sword or pen in materials more solid than words or blood  And they are heroically conscious of what they do Somehow they have caught fire from least to greatest they show the gleam of it in their eyes They are shoulder to shoulder in the van of the race working in a spirit of high romance to fulfil the edict of four centuries and the august command of the veiled and beckoning future True they invoke all the resources of many sciences fitting the parts of their huge machine together in orderly obedience to the most newly discovered laws and explaining the inexorable working of them in the modern Greek of their electro hydraulic jargon but not even themselves do they deceive with this mechanical exactness this materialistic definition Beyond the deed for all   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  these rapt enthusiasts is the miracle beyond the fact is the mystery beyond the mere daily labor which digs the ditch and rears lock chambers is the prophetic enthusiasm which foresees something vaguely grand in this new world venture which beholds destiny beckoning from the lofty tip of every steam shovel and a new era opening with the swing and surge of those mighty gates  These men on the Isthmus performing seven thousand labors of Hercules with their giant tools removing mountains and uniting oceans in a mood of lyric rapture these men our strong compatriots are poets in imagination and idealistic motive if not in words  Will the articulate poets prove worthy of them  H M  PARIS The limitations of space forbid our giving anything like a complete or adequate chronicle of contemporary French publications Those who desire such a chronicle should follow M Duhamel s fortnightly rubric in the Mercure de France and they should subscribe to L Effort Libre Les Bandeaux d Or La Nouvelle Revue Française  or some other French magazine  I have just finished a series of critical articles on French verse The New Age Sept 4 and following I propose to give here merely a summary of my conclusions  I think if our American bards would study Remy de Gourmont for rhythm Laurent Tailhade for delineation   Paris  Henri de Régnier for simplicity of syntactical construction Francis Jammes for humanity and the faculty of rendering one s own time and if they would get some idea of intensity from Tristan Corbière since they will not take their Villon in the original there might be some hope tor American poetry  If our writers would keep their eye on Paris instead of on London the London of today or of yesterday there might be some chance of their doing work that would not be demode before it gets to the press Practically the whole development of the English verse art has been achieved by steals from the French from Chaucer s time to our own and the French are always twenty to sixty years in advance As the French content and message are so different from the American content and message I think the Americans would be less likely to fall into slavish imitation and would learn hardly more than the virtues of method  Tristan Corbière is dead His work was known to Verlaine and to Richepin yet he can scarcely be said to have been published until the nineties He is gaunt as the Breton coast where his personal appearance had earned him the nickname of an ankou a corpse Verlaine compared him to Francois Villon not without reason He is not Villon but he is poignant and very much himself  The work of M Henri de Régnier has the fineness and the limitations of Greek vase painting   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  M Remy de Gourmont has made a most valuable contribution to our knowledge of rhythm structure in his very beautiful Livre de Litanies now contained in Le Pèlerin du Silence  The satires of M Laurent Tailhade are altogether uproarious and delectable  The work of M Francis Jammes is perhaps the most varied and the most human Its qualities are such that the two papers by Mr Ford Madox Hueffer recently printed in this magazine might have been written for the express purpose of praising it I am inclined to think that he is the most important poet in France but my reading is not exhaustive and this must be taken as a temporary estimate  M Verhaeren is held by some to be the greater poet  M Paul Fort has been elected Prince des Poètes I do not wish to speak of M Paul Claudel until I have had time to study him entire both in his prose and in his verse  Most of the younger men would seem to be descended from these authors  M Jules Romains is perhaps the most commanding figure among les jeunes He has as they say changé la pathétique There is a very clear exposition of the Unanimist doctrines at the end of Les Puissances de Paris I recommend the Poème Epique in Un Etre en Marche and the Prières in Odes et Prières   Paris  M Charles Vildrac has a charming narrative gift and M André Spire is something very like an Imagiste  M Henri Martin Barzun stands apart from the rest and preaches Simultaneity which is to say he wishes us to write our poems for a dozen voices at once as they write an orchestral score M Jammes has done something like this in Le Triomphe de la Vie M Barzun s ideas as expressed in L Ere du Drame are interesting and L Hymne des Forces moved me by its content and underlying force rather than by its execution The proletariat would seem to be getting something like a coherent speech This seems to me significant Though  M Barzun s propositions may seem at first fitted for comic rather than for serious expression I am not sure that he has not hit upon the true medium for democratic expression the fitting method of synthesis  Those desiring an introduction to a greater number of French poets are referred to Poètes d Aujourd hui by  A Van Bever and Paul Leautaud pub Mercure de France 26 rue de Condé Paris Une

Reviews  REVIEWS  Child of the Amazons by Max Eastman Mitchell Kennerley In the initial poem of this book Mr Max Eastman  presents under the thin veil of a classic myth a problem essentially modern modern that is in the peculiar emphasis placed upon it by the majority of people who write about such subjects today  Thyone one of the younger Amazons has fallen in love with a neighboring king and before the Queen of the Amazons and a council of her warriors pleads to be allowed to relinquish war and indulge the milder passion She spends a night thinking it over however and informs us of the error of her first impulse in the following nobly explanatory lines  Oh I love to live The task and the adventure toil and rest And mirth and the hot news of accident I love to live impetuous for joy And woe a life of action unto God Triumphantly I choose it I renounce My wish of love my hope my fruitful years For who would be the consort of a king Subduer of the earth and be subdued Who would bring into this heroic world A child before she had gone forth to prove That she herself was equal to the world  This is the kind of sentiment that passes with many as the most advanced modern thought Before she had gone forth where To prove that she herself was equal to the world how By retreating from it It seems to be a part of certain modern socialist   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  propaganda to regard love as apart from life as not in itself perhaps the one great conflict of life and one not subject to conquest by negation It is rather extremely doubtful if one may come to any fitting terms with life without first facing the conflict of love through experience The world is after all not outside us but within us  But this is a question of personal philosophy rather than of poetry Other poems in the volume achieve a more definite poetic impression than this one in which the reiterative iamb is awkwardly insistent Notably three shorter poems At the Aquarium In March and Diogenes if it were not for these the general impression would be disappointing especially as Mr Eastman s recent book The Enjoyment of Poetry had led one to expect so much In this he gave us a singularly concise and intimate analysis of the psychological basis of poetry it was in fact a definite contribution to the subject But the poems of Mr Eastman fail just because of his analytical attitude the emotion is not direct but deflected He has written about the emotion he has not presented it Is it a fault of temperament Is he appreciative rather than creative Or is it a failure in adjusting in focusing in concentrating deliberately upon the poetic medium Mr Eastman knows well enough how to single out the words that give a sense of life We wish that he would give us more of them in his poetry At the Aquarium and several of the other short poems   Reviews  in the volume are worth innumerable children of Amazons and still born apostrophes of heroes We quote At the Aquarium  Serene the silver fishes glide Stern lipped and pale and wonder eyed As through the aged deeps of ocean They glide with wan and wavy motion They have no pathway where they go They flow like water to and fro They watch with never winking eyes They watch with staring cold surprise The level people in the air The people peering peering there Who wander also to and fro And know not why or where they go Yet have a wonder in their eyes Sometimes a pale and cold surprise  A C H  Poems and Songs second series by Richard Middleton  Fisher Unwin  These are the poems of a distinguished amateur who is nearly always a poet And as amateurishness is the note of the time in contemporary England it may be well contended that he expresses his decade And surely few will reproach him that he cared little for the steely perfections of art seeing that there is in his work so much that is sympathetic so much that is human and so much pathos that is in no way egotistic  He wrote many poems that will not serve as models but scarcely one without some touch of beauty that was distinctly his own and interpreted by his own emotions  His poetry is primarily poetry of the emotions and intended for readers rather than for the cold senate of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  craftsmen And so one finds this Carol of the Poor Children  We are the poor children come out to see the sights On this day of all days on this night of nights  Our bellies are so empty we have no singing voice But on this night of all nights good children must rejoice  We do rejoice we do rejoice as hard as we can try A fine star a new star is shining in the sky  Lovers of Riley will go mad over him He is artistically about as good as Symons and he proves that English poetry did not stop with the nineties His first volume appeared posthumously in May 1912 There can be no hesitation in granting him a permanent place among the personalities of English verse among the post Victorians  E P  NOTES  The awarding of prizes is a responsibility which the editors of Poetry would willingly have delegated to some higher authority But at present there is no great poet sitting in judgment to whom lesser poets may appeal none that is in America Mr Yeats over in Ireland stands high enough above the crowd to assume that position with dignity but even if he were willing to pronounce the verdict it would seem unfair that poets of the United States should have no voice in the awarding of a prize or prizes offered by our guarantors And any Notes  jury of American poets would include necessarily some of our contributors of the past year who should be contestants rather than judges  It seems best therefore that this year s prizes should be awarded by the editors and the Advisory Committee of Poetry who of course will not compete The announcement of awards will be made next month  Of the poets contributing to this number Mr Yeats and Mr Cawein are well known to lovers of the art and readers of Poetry Mr Broadus also of the University of Alberta has been within our gates before  Mr William Ellery Leonard was class poet in 1898 at the Boston University after which he took an M A at Harvard and other degrees in Germany Since 1906 he has been in
