THE CHEECHAS  H E Cheechas defended Chachak The grandfathers of Serbia s fourth line held her third capital  For a man is a grandfather here at forty and a fighter at eighty until he dies And the Germans found it out and flinched and fled from them  They had no uniform but their gray hair and beards and needed none They had no rations but half a pound of dry bread a day and it sufficed them They were armed with rifles as old and battered as themselves and they battered the Germans back   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Three times they drove them back and took that shattered and exploding capital away from them  Then in the fourth attack when four in every five of them were down The rest of the oldest men who had seen free Serbia born and were seeing her die So they believed with the rest went away muttering What do I care for myself what do I count for Three million people lost nothing else matters three million people lost three million lost  And many of them died by the way where hundreds were lying starving and freezing Dying on high Montenegrin mountains in the wind and the snow that grew sleet So gray icicles grew on their beards and the sleet cut cold skin on their faces And the wind cut their song into shreds the song they were singing when they died  The Suabas are building houses the Serbs shall live in them The Suabas are planting corn the Serbs shall eat it up The Suabas are pressing wine the Serbs shall drink of it  And they drank to their fill of the war that the Huns and their helots had brewed But the Serbs and their brothers shall finish it   AT BETHLEHEM  Twenty six thousand men are building at Bethlehem Armor plates and palisades and props of steel for the peace of Christ That comes momently by breathing spells in a world forever at war Twenty six thousand men sweating blindly to build a world forever beginning to fall Twenty six thousand men are making tools for breaking scrapping scraping and fixing foundations anew  For life ever fuses and glows Like the heart of a rose in the fire that eats up red billets of steel like raw fagots of wood And a war is as good as a rose in the eyes of the Watcher of Space A war is as brief as a rose in its growth and its death in the fire of the Forger of Stars And the fire ever burns out the dross in the depths of the stone and the soul All the fires that ape or man ever kindled on earth were lit and fused to keep these crucibles boiling  And now they roll a loaded crucible that flames white hot  along the level rails and swinging truck ways overhead And the moulds are made ready and prepared And they look like trenches of shadow before the raw red  tide of war pours into them   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And one half naked foreman of his gang is a general of today s grim shaping of life  A general who knows his job and holds it hard fisted Holds it and sways it like a tool he beats and welds and batters with  For the war is a job and a tool that must be beaten out and battled with to the bitter end of the stint and finally finished  Ten huge trip hammers rising and falling in cadenced choruses affirm it Twenty six rolling mills that print a gospel new and red in steel still raw are ready to publish it  Twenty six thousand men twenty six million men in smoke and fumes and mud and grime assert and by their blood and breath maintain it  THE RED COFFINS  After the revolution in Petrograd They made a great common grave in a vaster parade ground outside the city And they brought the red coffins of those who fell fighting for freedom To honor and bury them   They piled them tier by tier while the crowd in silence  watched them And as the pile rose and spread to many it seemed Like the red blood of Russia welling from a mortal wound And some saw red fagots of freedom rising and kindling  a fire that would warm all the world But no man there could tell the truth of it  DOWN FIFTH AVENUE  The crowd makes way for them  The mob of motors women in motors footmen in motors Manhattan s transients in motors life s transients in motors has cleared and disappeared  And their mothers and their children their wives their lovers and friends are lining the curb and knitting and whispering  The flags are floating and beckoning to them the breezes are beckoning and whispering their secrets That the city has hushed to hear while trade and trivial things give place  And through the crowd that holds its breath too long a restless stir like the starting of troubled breathing says They are coming And the distant beat of feet begins  to blend with the beat of laboring hearts   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And the emptiness that missed a beat in the heart of the city becomes the street of a prayer and a passion This is a street of mothers and their sons for an hour in the life of Manhattan  And today makes way for them  The past makes way for them  This morning s discontent yesterday s greed last year s uncertainty are muted and transmuted to a surging urge to victory  Spirits that stood at Bunker Hill and Valley Forge Ticon deroga Yorktown Lundy s Lane Fort Sumter Appomatox are resurrected here  With older fathers and mothers who farmed and pushed frontiers and homes for freedom westward steadily  With freedom s first grandfathers and forerunners who grew to hold hill towers and forest fastnesses and range the sea and all its shores and islands for the right to live for liberty  And their blood beats in these boy hearts and their hill bred and sea bred strength is stirring in these feet that beat their measured cadences of courage  For now the tide is turning eastward at last  And the sound of the fall of their feet on the asphalt is the sound of the march of the waves of a tide that is flooding   Waves that marched to the western coast past forests and plains mountains and deserts and wrought their work in a world gone by  And the ripple of the ranks of these regiments that march to suffer and to die is the ripple of a great brown river in flood that forges seaward  And the ripple of the light on eyes and lips that watch and work is the swelling of a greater flood that forces them to go  And the ripple and arrest of light on dull gun barrels that crest their flow are runes of a ritual spelled in steel and a service enduring  And each beat of their feet and each beat of their hearts is a word in a gospel of steel that says the nations through ruins grow one again  When God s drill master War has welded nations in ranks that their children may serve Him together For tomorrow makes way for them John Curtis Underwood   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE OLD GODS  The Old Gods never die  They only watch and wait They wait for a thousand years Beside the tall church gate  Jove and Neptune and Mars Tyr and Odin and Thor These watch with the ageless stars  They watch forevermore  They call with the worn bronze trumpets They call and all men hear Their voice is deeper than church bells Deeper than chimes rung clear It charms like the seraphim s And is older than all the hymns  We hear the tramp of many feet Upon the ancient pavements of the Gods We see the people hasten from the street Chanting their lauds Their fashion s garments off they cast And don the shag skins of the past  The Old Gods rule the seas And men are fed to the waves   The Old Gods burn the cities They bind and ravish their slaves  They ride on the storm and the lightning They revel in jungle and brake They inhabit the seats of the thunders When the tempests in wrath awake  A strange strange smile Is the Old Gods while They hope for the Cross to fall And they be lords of all  Jove and Neptune and Mars Tyr and Odin and Thor These watch with the ageless stars They watch forevermore  The Old Gods never die They only watch and wait They wait for a thousand years Beside the tall church gate  Calvin Dill Wilson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  KOL NIDRE  When twilight charms the sunset into dusk The singer comes I do not know his step Nor ever have I seen the form of him But when through darkening window panes I reach My vision for that straining star whose course Was preconceived in me and with me I know must pass forever I hear his voice Deep rhythm circling stern creation s path And passing far beyond it Kol Nidre A little silence all is swept away And there are only God and nothingness Myself besides I who am more than God And less than nothingness for it is rest  As from dissolving mists sudden appears The city s countenance so from these days Melting like mists away rise clear and stern The towers of the solemn days that were Dread days of reckoning whose shofar blasts Like thunder dawns of upturned faces pleas Like wrath of midnight storms sing in my blood Wakening memories long dead best dead   Two thousand years of listless wandering Ages without a battle cry Lo he Who sings behind the wall is meek the words   Flow gently from his soul and you whose song Is light unburdened by our Elohim Cannot conceive the terrible despair But we who sing it know for as we sing We suffer Every note a lash Each word A lovely daughter s shame Ay every verse A noble city s doom of martyrdom And the whole song the story of a race Which wrought God from itself and lost its soul  Kol Nidre and a hundred armies march Retreat A hundred armies bannerless and slow A far flung shadow o er the fields of earth March through my soul and will not cease Give me Your crucifix children of Christendom The thing you hold up to the sun and wail And moan your sign of suffering The dead have pride and seeing it on me Will go their way Yet I ll not desecrate The dead Their pride twas all they had in life  Kol Nidre God will this never have end These mighty trumpet blasts for whom the dead They do not hear I say The living Lord Have you no laughter left These living straws out in your mighty storm They do not hear your storm only the cries Of bleeding lambs and drowning swine reach them   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But lo the singer sings all I have lived And will live yet all that my race has lived And will live yet Listen All laughter dies A knock upon my window pane fumbling Black flapping wings a voice wild with despair Traitor what have you mused in Ascalon  Kol Nidre So throughout the centuries Deep beautiful and glorious to hear But what would you of me Is there a path You d have me take I ve beaten every one A thousand roads are in my blood What then Is it a call to fight Battle with whom Amalak long is dead the gentile gods Are slain and all their golden temples dust Perhaps it is a call to life We long Have ceased to live wearied Or is it death How shall we die who knew not how to live  God God Save me from this despair Hurl me If so you will down the ravines of death Where every sunbeam is a thorn to prick And every flower is a wound to bear All loveliness a memory of wrath And spirit madness I ll not care An end Let be to all this waste See if I die There is a heaven of stars goes down with me And if I live on Hush the song ceases The singer goes and with him the despair Go singer go far from this land the draught You offer it is much too strong Highways Broader than these shall hear your song For me The dusk deepens deepens there is my star  HUMAN SPEECH  I know the shady moving of its waves Circling old shores of thought all solemnly Its loves and hates its moods storm taught and free For like the sea it hides a million graves Beneath an iron gleam that darkly braves The sun and storm It heaves too like the sea Full of its life and flees to Memory Even as she flees to her shaggy caves Three massive silences creation s Lord Wrought in the heart of life before the birth The silence of the dead stirring again The hush of Love wielding a flaming sword Which holds the swerving passions of the earth And the great silence in the speech of men  Samuel Roth   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FIGS FROM THISTLES  FIRST FIG My candle burns at both ends It will not last the night But ah my foes and oh my friends It gives a lovely light  SECOND FIG Safe upon the solid rock the ugly houses stand Come and see my shining palace built upon the sand  THE UNEXPLORER There was a road ran past our house Too lovely to explore I asked my mother once she said That if you followed where it led It brought you to the milk man s door That s why I have not traveled more  THURSDAY And if I loved you Wednesday Well what is that to you I do not love you Thursday So much is true  And why you come complaining Is more than I can see I  loved you Wednesday yes but what Is that to me   THE PENITENT  I had a little Sorrow Born of a little Sin I found a room all damp with gloom  And shut us all within And Little Sorrow weep said I And Little Sin pray God to die And I upon the floor will lie  And think how bad I ve been  Alas for pious planning It mattered not a whit As far as gloom went in that room  The lamp might have been lit My little Sorrow would not weep My little Sin would go to sleep To save my soul I could not keep  My graceless mind on it  So up I got in anger And took a book I had And put a ribbon on my hair  To please a passing lad And One thing there s no getting by I ve been a wicked girl said I But if I can t be sorry why  I might as well be glad  Edna St Vin cent Millay   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  INVENTIONS  DEITY  In incense

on And let you fall behind I too am blind  II  And you my little friend of the gay dress In a swift moment of encountered eyes I have touched your hand and kissed your wistfulness And looked with you upon eternities And I know that neither the powder on your nose Nor the amazing things you wear upon your feet Can alter the gentleness my spirit owes To vision of you hurrying down the street  III  I know you You are one of those who fear The certain end of their uncertainties Who never having had possession here Still seek it in such transient things as these Bright windows looking into gaudy places Where there are wine lists and long bills of fare   AndAnd leaning girls with splendid shoulders intimate eyes playing with passionate bare faces IV In the concert hall You are the musician I the listener Here your fingers touchMake no music for mc W e pass one another Silently no bow I do not marvel so that you can wear A flower in your tailored button hole As that the flower does not perish there In the Winter of your soul VI When you have passed and other eyes Have found me with a new surprise I know I shall not call to mind The colored hat you wore the kind Of dress nor anything so sure Only your laughter will endure And come to me on other trips Down other streets from other lips Raymond Peckham Holden    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THREE NEGRO SPIRITUALS  TH E LOST LOVE  Oh

sound The maddening sound They stamp the ground They gash the ground The long grass tickles their legs their heels They come in clattering swoops and reels  Beware Beware  Beware their hoofs Their pounding hoofs  Like hail on roofs On rickety roofs  They scatter the flowers The fields of flowers  In petalling showers Yellow red showers  With crashing hammer and thud and pound  The satyrs leap in a whirling bound  Beware Beware  Their hoofs will shatter your garden walk Their pound will smother your cautious talk They ll batter your red geranium pot They ll gut your cabbage and onion plot   Hark from the hill the forest hill Where trees are still Hark to the beat The laughter beat The echoing beat Of hammering feet In the after heat Of a clattering run through miles of sun  Beware Beware

Magazine of Verse  COMMENT  THE NEW INTERNATIONALISM  FTER THE WAR predictions are a temptation to the facile thinker In the ferment of this chaotic moment the world seems in process of being made over the imagination lightly foresees the design which the new minting will bear and as lightly underestimates the power of forces which tend to run the molten metal back into old molds Prophecy is never cautious indeed caution is an unheroic virtue quite incapable no doubt of designing the new stamp Yet a certain amount of caution may be recommended as we listen to the seers and visionaries who cry out their hopes and theories in as many tongues as once before according to the Book of Genesis halted a monumental effort of the race toward unity  However certain tendencies would seem to be inevitably accelerated by the war The presence of many nations in the western battle line the union of the powerful youth of these nations in the same death grapple with a formidable enemy can not fail to enforce and increase international sympathies throughout that group When peace comes our boys will come home and poilu and Tommie and all the others will go back to their civilian jobs but in the hearts of all till the last aged survivor dies these fiery years will be a memory of horror and splendor a memory growing more romantic from year to year until the horror fades away and only the splendor remains Thus the men of these nations   will remain united at heart by the fierce ordeal through which they have passed together and to a certain degree they will pass on their sense of comradeship in the stories they tell to their children and grandchildren  The tie between this country and France must become one would think especially strong Lafayette and Franklin began it long ago and now our soldiers are dying on French soil and their heroic blood will fertilize the new spiritual growth of a nation whose spirit has fertilized the world And lesser agencies will contribute inevitably to this sympathy the adopting of French war orphans the rehabilitation of French towns all the numerous contributions of American money and energy to the restoration of France and its French speaking neighbor Belgium  Thus after the war our splendid isolation is like to disappear Some league of nations in all probability will express this fact politically and a closer interaction in the arts and literature will express it intellectually It would seem that our educational systems should prepare for the inevitable by urging more attention to modern languages especially French and Spanish the languages of our nearest intellectual and political neighbors  In the arts and literature it may be said with a certain justice that Americans have been too much aware rather than too little of influences from over seas We have been too colonial too respectful of the foreign verdict even when most arrogantly boastful we have had too little self confidence too little competent and informed appreciation of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  our own achievements But this is a provincial rather than a cosmopolitan trait and its cure is more knowledge More knowledge of foreign art and literature on our part will mean the separation in our minds of foreign modern art from the immense over emphasis imparted to it by the achievements of the past If we can strip from modern foreign art this merely sentimental over emphasis we shall be able to compare it more justly with our own  And in this juster estimate of our own rank we shall be aided by their more knowledge of us as well as by our more knowledge of them One fact against which our poets and artists have had to contend has been lack of reciprocity it has been only too easy for reputations to cross the ocean westward but almost impossible to cross eastward Even England whose language we speak has listened with patronizing condescension to our voices and France though less prejudiced intellectually has been even more isolated in national pride The sympathies aroused by the war may change all this indeed already there are signs Such a book as Pierre de Lanux s Young France and New America Macmillan Co with its ardent acknowledgment of the debt of young France to Whitman and its warm appreciation of our note in modern art is an eager plea for closer relations uttered to his own countrymen and ours and thus is an important sign  Italy also is aware of Whitman and possibly of a few more recent Americans And there are signs too from the Latin American nations to the south of us Pan American   magazines poets wandering to our ports intellectual sympathies beginning to take the hint from commerce  When these Latin peoples are once aroused to intellectual hospitality they may prove more freely reciprocal than the English England has the indifference of an elder brother toward the obstreperous relative over seas the There little boy attitude is hardly to be disturbed from this distance by either assertion or proof of the youngster s equal or greater strength Recently I heard two of our most famous poets express impatient regret that these United States had inherited the English language instead of growing an indigenous product It loads all English literature past and present on our backs said one what chance have we of real freedom or spontaneity But as the English language for better or worse seems to be ours for keeps we may only hope that the deeper sympathies aroused by the war may shake the elder brother out of his insularity and force him to accept the relationship on equal terms  Thus in spite of reactionary and separative tendencies which must always discount prophecies of international amity it seems reasonable to hope through the sorrow of these years for a closer intellectual union among the nations and more generous appreciation and sympathy in the arts  H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REVIEWS  LARGE MEASURES  Toward the Gulf by Edgar Lee Masters Macmillan Co  When in the preface to this volume Mr Masters touches on the iambic tetrameter of the Spoon River poems it is hard to see how the term can be of more than faint interest to him For one thing it belongs to a lame science one failing to assume the twofold character of the art it analyses and take note of the large delicate measures possible to prose the cadences of passages in the Brothers Karamazoff or Madame Bovary to cite at random These if not poetry bear the kindred marks of it being rhythmic language that stirs the heart as wind does water And even the most inclusive study of metre and cadence would still be coarse and approximate since art finding its birth in the forms of life their tone and their rhythm the great poems can obey no easy arithmetic but only the final mathematic law the infinite equation Were it otherwise Traubel would count like Whitman and an army of writers like the few who hypnotize them Prosody at best provides the poet with but a set of diagrams more or less diverting of which certainly a work of art intact complete like the Spoon River Anthology bears no trace Its right to an official metric term is well enough but less relevant than the fact that the short fluid fateful lines invade the ear with the terseness of the grave that in a new fabric of words the limbs of   life the face the voice the hands appear once more to manifest themselves The Great Valley and this new volume Toward the Gulf which to quote from the preface continue the attempts of Spoon River to mirror the age and country in which we live often afford delight keen and painful as the anthology but not I think so unbrokenly This new book at least mingles a sprinkling of verse wherein prosody does usurp the lines with poems authentic as daylight and like the Anthology freighted with the presence of reality the cargo of great art  T o read certain of them Johnny Appleseed The Lake Boats Sir Galahad is to touch the soil of Illinois and the states south to get the very voices of the mid western country their slight flatness of tone in contrast to the fragrance of land and water  People were walking the decks and talking  Children were singing  And down on the purser s deck  A man was dancing by himself  Whirling around like a dervish  And this Captain said to me  No life is better than this  I could live forever  And do nothing but run this boat  From the dock at Chicago to the dock at Holland  And back again  Then there are poems less sleepy than these that scarcely detach themselves from the landscape they celebrate The Eighth Crusade for one lifts its characters for a minute from their rocking chairs in Pleasant Plains into the midst of plump Swiss life the Orient glimmers on the horizon   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and faintly about the tale hangs the ancient raillery of Venus so deftly are these people made to take their places under the sun  One hears too the nervous voices of the city the prostitute and the editor at Perko s the sound and look of beggars and venders in the granite ways of mad Chicago And there is the sharp sketch of an Indian runner and his voice saying  It was under a sky as blue as the cup of a harebell It was by a red and yellow mountain It was by a great river That we ran  Besides these bas reliefs is larger modelling extravagant ineffectual figures emerging more dramatically from the background their divergence and abortive return With the enterprise and at times the elegance of a Velasquez Mr Masters shapes these images the dream ridden the paranoiac the spendthrift the nymphomaniac the dogmatist the fanatic Root and branch he evolves them One group springs from parents quietly shadowed in a pair of old daguerreotypes  They were married you see The clasp on this gutta percha case Locks them together They were locked together in life And a hasp of brass Keeps their shadows face to face in the case  As if to bring such lives into scale three studies Voltaire Napoleon Thomas Paine rear themselves handsomely above the horizon And a number of poems Grand River   Marshes Poor Pierrot Song of Women among them mirror with a most caressing music the beauties of flesh and flowers earth air and water One of them Widow La Rue has grim terror veiled in a very skilful ballad soft and wanton like a scarf  Notwithstanding there are holes I think in the weave of the book Some of these very poems for the most part green beneath the bark contain dry twigs dead branches And over a number of them rhetoric reigns Possibly Mr Masters is a poet who looks sometimes with too dissective a mind and losing the sense of mystery in vainly seeking the cause now and then forsakes poetry for speculation and analysis Not always content to witness select and mirror the image he seems to try going about it back of it into it even till it withers and is broken and no longer is able to communicate its sap and bloom to his words The language then becomes clever toneless literary and even rattles a little at times  Also one feels that in strange contradiction to his patrician quality of mind that directs an unflinching gaze this book shows now and then a slight strain of idealism the cream tart of the bourgeois according to Rodin Like the Friar Yves of his own poem he weeps because  Nothing is left but life indeed I have burned heaven I have quenched hell then as if to console himself he fashions sometimes Utopian heavens dreams of wholesale liberty democracy nobility made almost from the butterick patterns of poetry and wear   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ing a false glad air among the strange proud authentic wistful cadences of the book  But if cleverness tarnishes these pages somewhat as indeed it did with Byron and Browning or sentimentality blunts them sometimes as in the case of Whitman even one thing is clear and refreshing Mr Masters never writes from a sense of chic is afraid of no detail that happens to belong in the picture no inelegance as of rubber heels or Christian Science Striking almost at random Toward the Gulf evokes a wealth of shapes and casts exciting shadows which though varied seem held together by the mad idea of unity As in the last poem Botanical Gardens a review of all life a flower a tree a man a woman stand side by side in the landscape moved or warped by the same impulse of seed root and branch About them in this book falls frequently the relentless light of a gray day but sometimes the brilliance of the sun or the ease of rain In a manner more formal than is usual with Mr Masters and equally poignant Poor Pierrot seems to reach the soul of rain Here is the better half of the poem  I have learned the secret of silence silence long and deep  The dead know all that I know that is why they sleep  They could do nothing with fate or love or fame or strife  When life fills full the soul then life kills life  I would glide under the earth as a shadow over a dune  Into the soul of silence under the sun and moon  And forever as long as the world stands or the stars flee  Be one with the sands of the shore and one with the sea  Dorothy Dudley   MID AMERICA AWAKE  Mid American

naked earth  Behold I am one who has been building a house and driving nails with stones that break The hammer of song has been given me I shall build my house with great hammers New song is tearing the cords of my throat  These songs represent a new plasticity in poetry To quote from Mr Anderson s brief preface Words run out beyond the power of words And when the words run out thus and they are given to us the suggestions the half utterances prove as forceful as direct as the more evolved crests of expression Of course this method is one of shifting planes of broken images but the truth is in the final unity of the impression received Many of the songs are moving as music is moving we are emotionally stirred without knowing exactly why Does the musician know the meaning of every note that comes to him Mr Anderson has been content to set down chords and phrases without troubling about context or sequence letting the compelling emotion take care of that letting the chain of associations work out in its own way In a sense these songs are musical improvisations with recurring themes and motives In the Song of Industrial America we have the opening theme They tell themselves so many little lies beloved  They tell themselves so many little lies and then the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  recurrent I m the broken end of a song myself  I m a song myself the broken end of a song myself In the Song of the Soul of Chicago it is the bridges always the bridges and so on  There is indeed much more design in the songs than Mr Anderson would seem to indicate Perhaps he wanted to forestall the critics by simply making them a present of what they might choose as their chief weapon crudity And they have taken the cue But the crudity here is a knowing crudity an expressive crudity Mr Anderson has a sure sense of what he wants to do He is not fumbling If there is apparent groping a choked articulateness it is because this is precisely the emotion to be conveyed And what he conveys in this book is the groping choked struggle of the soul in Mid America towards song  I am a little thing a tiny little thing on the vast prairies I know nothing My mouth is dirty I cannot tell what I want My feet are sunk in the black swampy land but I am a lover I love life In the end love shall save me  First there are the broken things myself and the others I don t mind that I m gone shot to pieces I m part of the scheme I m the broken end of a song myself We are all that here in the West here in Chicago Tongues clatter against teeth There s nothing but shrill screams and a rattle That had to be it s part of the scheme  Little faint beginning of things old things dead sweet old things a life lived in Chicago in the West in the whirl of industrial America  God knows you might have become something else just like me You might have made soft little tunes written cynical little ditties eh Why the devil didn t you make some money and own an automobile   It is the cry of the singer under the burden of industrialism the dust of the cities against the clean green life of the corn fields the strident need for song above the clatter of the machines And through it all is conveyed also a certain love of this thing that we call our civilization the dust the weariness the undercurrent of remembrance of old sweet natural things the factories the engines the bridges always the bridges with somehow a willingness to see the thing through and the faith and the prayer that we may get back to the clean life of the growing corn at last  Of course this interpretation really limits the book It doesn t need any interpretation any more than music does it is to be felt As Mr John Butler Yeats says What can be explained is not poetry It is significant I think that Mid America is becoming self conscious is expressing itself in song in a fashion distinctive to itself One has no wish to be partisan or sectional but is it not through local consciousness that we shall achieve national expression By local consciousness of course one does not mean anything so slight and superficial as local color which is only skin deep Mr George Moore has said that cosmopolitanism kills art But art was always cosmopolitan the barriers which he assumed to be so absolute were always transcended there was a tremendous amount of borrowing in the antique world What really isolated art and produced that unique flavor which we call national or racial was the artist s attachment to place upon which his sense of identity depended and this selection of place and atmosphere   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  this orientation of the spirit for the sake of the preservation of identity will always operate it will never be lacking to art however much it may be lacking to all life outside art What is significant then in the work of men like Vachel Lindsay Carl Sandburg Edgar Lee Masters and Sherwood Anderson as well as other poets that one could name is this sense of identity with their own country side their own city s streets and with the past present and future of Mid America It is from this kind of thing that national art springs Yet the work of these men is widely divergent another hopeful sign of vitality and fertility One may accept one and reject another yet they are all one must admit expressively Mid American  The reader will no doubt be repelled as well as attracted by many of these songs That too is one source of their strength of their expressiveness No one poet will tell the whole story Both Synge and Yeats reveal the soul of Ireland A C H  FAR WESTERN VERSE  Out Where the West Begins by Arthur Chapman Houghton Mifflin Co Riders of the Stars and Songs of the Outlands by Henry Herbert Knibbs Houghton Mifflin Co  Sun and Saddle Leather and Grass grown Trails by  Badger Clark Richard G Badger  Boundaries have changed since Eugene Field published his poems in Chicago under the title of A Little Book of   Western Verse Chicago is still the West for those who live there or on the Atlantic sea coast but for anyone living beyond the Rockies Chicago is part of the East The books of verse which head this review are of the Far West that God forsaken country of whose value Daniel Webster had such slight opinion Bret Harte of course opened up the West poetically speaking But his was the West of the gold fevered easterners who came in a flurry and stayed to repent or to grow rich as the case might be Since that time not only the Pacific coast lands but the far inland desert ranges hills pastures and purple mountains have been peopled by a new race of men who have grown up with the land and have learned to love it in a way that an easterner sometimes finds hard to understand  This note is struck in the familiar cowboy song  Oh give me a home where the buffalo roam And the deer and the antelope play Where seldom is heard a discouraging word And the skies are not cloudy all day And the reader must be prepared to find it in the work of more sophisticated western poets It is this sentiment in fact which insures the popularity of Arthur Chapman s title poem Out Where the West Begins a poem with good lines in it but whose chief merit is that it expresses a popular sentiment The other poems in the book exhibit various aspects of western life with varying degrees of success Mr Chapman s worst failing is a tendency to mix colloquialisms When a cow puncher says old top or a sheep herder says that his sheep are   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  drinkin their bloomin fill you know that they have got store clothes on And there is also much of the pseudo poetic in his phrasing yon mesa for instance or where gleams yon gaunt peak s snowy hood  Mr Chapman is at his best in poems not in the colloquial manner Before the Gringo Came Out Among the Big Tilings At the Outposts or In a Deserted Mining Cainp in spite of such rhyme words as steed and mart The Sheriff s Report however with its laconic note of duty done We just went out to git him and we did is perhaps the best poem in the volume  I don t know why one who writes about western things should adopt a quasi bantering tone about nature and a colloquialism that comes far more from the echoes of Service or Kipling than from the plains or desert It is a theatricality that is put on as easily as grease paint or a wig but is quite as obviously detected  In suggesting that he is the Service of Arizona or words to that effect the publishers of Henry Herbert Knibbs two books have done the author an injustice Three years ago in reviewing Songs of the Outlands POETRY called these poems the best verse of its kind written in this century or perhaps since Bret Harte himself Mr Knibbs is much better than Service His vocabulary is his own or rather the western vocabulary is his own and his verse has genuine musical quality which is not borrowed either Mr Knibbs is particularly good in the dramatic lyric such as The Shallows of the Ford or The Walking   Man or The Mule Skinner These and others of his poems are western ballads most appreciated it may be by those who know the life he celebrates even as Irish folk song may be most at home in Ireland The stuff his verse is made of is indigenous I like particularly that bit of a song called Eh Johnny Jo which expresses his attitude towards  his work  The wind of dawn has swept the plains And the sun runs ver the purple sage Gone is the rack of the winter rains Leaving the hill like a faery page Of a book that is old but is ever new And fresh as the wild flowers sweet with dew   Gosh I m ridin close to the fence and low And strainin my buttins eh Johnny Jo It ain t no use for to talk like that It s second hand scenery made to print Just hand me my ole gray puncher hat And them spurs and quirt do you get the hint For I got to ride easy with elbows high Mebby not style but she sure has go We ll all git to Heaven by and by But we ll travel outdoors eh Johnny Jo  Mr John Butler Yeats in his letters says there are no solitaries in America but the solitary does not stand on a street corner in New York and proclaim himself  Shall I leave the hills the high far hills that shadow the morning  plain Shall I leave the desert sand and sage that gleams in the winter rain Shall I leave the ragged bridle trail to ride in the city street To snatch a song from the printed word or sit at a master s feet  To barter the sting of the mountain wind for the choking fog and smoke   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  To barter the song of the mountain stream for the babble of city  folk To lose my grip on the god I know and fumble among the creeds O rocks and pines of the high far hills hear the lisp of the valley  reeds  There is a touch of the romantic in Mr Knibbs work which distinguishes him from other writers of western verse One finds it in Oliver West in The Last of Cavaliers in Overland the Red and other poems and it rises to the genuinely poetic in The Far and Lonely Hill I d like to quote from these and others from the poems about horses and dogs from The Glorious Fool and particularly from the song about the cowboys in heaven an idea that one meets often enough in cowboy songs but one which has seldom been given with so much humor and swing as in Sunshine Over Yuma  Come my little cayuse and lope along lope along  Guess we got in wrong somehow  Don t exactly fancy just the way the folks are starin  Can t exactly cotton to the funny clothes they re wearin  Oh it s Heaven but it s lonely and we ve had our little airin  So we ll fan it back to Arizona now  But the reader may be left to make his own selection  If we call Mr Knibbs a romanticist perhaps we may say that Mr Badger Clark author of High Chin Bob is a realist that is if the words may be taken not as a means of hard and fast classification but as denoting merely a slight distinction In the title Sun and Saddle Leather one recognizes at once something of Mr Clark s quality something of that same quality that made High Chin Bob or The Glory Trail as it is called in this book so simple con   crete and explicit Curiously enough though we pointed out improvements made upon that poem by the cowboys there is not another poem in the book that is not in the natural order of speech and a part of the power of this author comes from that fact And High Chin Bob as I like to call it is not by any means the only good poem in this book There are poems certain to please not only the old cow men but the most arrant tenderfoot who has never worn chaps or spurs and poems such as The Cowboy s Prayer or The Christmas Trail are as good as Riley Here are the first and last stanzas of the latter  The wind is blowin cold down the mountain tips of snow And cross the ranges layin brown and dead It s cryin through the valley trees that wear the mistletoe And mournin with the gray clouds overhead Yet it s sweet with the beat of my little hawse s feet And I whistle like the air was warm and blue For I m ridin up the Christmas trail to you  Old Folks  I m a ridin up the Christmas trail to you The coyote s winter howl cuts the dusk behind the hill But the ranch s shinin window I kin see And though I don t deserve it and I reckon never will There ll be room beside the fire kep for me Skimp my plate cause I m late Let me hit the old kid gait For tonight I m stumblin tired of the new And I m ridin up the Christmas trail to you  Old Folks I m a ridin up the Christmas trail to you  In God s Reserves The Plainsmen and The Westerner Mr Clark proves that he writes straightforward verse as well as the colloquial while many songs in the latter vein   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  have the same kind of good fun that we find in High Chin Bob This is not by the way the only song of Mr Clark s that the cowboys have appropriated Mr Lomax has a cowboy version of Ridin the first poem in this book and when I read A Border Affair I recognized it as a song that I had heard sung by Orville Cox a cowboy from Taos New Mexico Apparently when the cowboys find a song they like they fit it to music that they know already or make up adding unique phrases and quavers and cowboy yells of their own  Grass grown Trails which is just out does not tempt me away from the earlier volume Perhaps its author is becoming too civilized  I have said that Mr Clark proves himself an equal of James Whitcomb Riley and I don t know that any further appreciation is necessary unless it be in the words of an old cow man You can break me if there s a dead poem in it I read the hull twenty two I don t know how Clark knowed but he knows And Mr Clark knows too that love of the West of which I spoke in the beginning  When the last free trail is a prim fenced land And our graves grow weeds through forgetful Mays Richer and statelier then you ll reign Mother of men whom the world will praise And your sons will love you and sigh for you Labor and battle and die for you But never the fondest will understand The way we have loved you young young land  A C H   FIRST BOOKS AND OTHERS  One might pluck a nosegay from the books of brief lyrics which come to POETRY for review It would be a pretty nosegay too fresh flowers delicate fragrance fair colors Nothing startling in the bunch rarely anything wild or woodsy but mostly simple garden flowers which have been watered and tended and which surely deserve a place in the quiet rooms of the mind One rarely finds passion in them but often the beauty of quieter emotions expressed with fit simplicity and sometimes with a certain distinction  Airs and Ballads by John McClure Alfred A Knopf Here for example is John McClure who has a light foot and a singing voice His attitude is in the initial poem  Apology  I am a poetaster And ray knee I bend To Marlowe my master Villon my friend I am a swashbuckler And I break my sword Before Blake my tutor Shakespeare my lord I should burn my song books This very day If singing didn t matter So little anyway  I said attitude unconsciously but there is too much attitude in many of the poems in their motive and phrasing Such a poem as Home for example is spoiled by the merry mad loves in its middle stanzas And how can a   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  poet be guilty of such triteness as To a Lady or the Almighty God poem which follows it when he is capable of so soft and tender a song as The Dream  In a strange grove of poplars  In a strange far place  She came to me between the trees  With white death on her face  She came between the poplar trees  And wandered at my side  It was beyond the mind of man  To think that she had died  It was beyond the mind of man Even to dream her dead I knew the music of her voice In every word she said  A Book of Verse by Morris Gilbert Privately printed  The author of this thin volume privately printed last summer has been in active service aboard a submarine chaser for somewhat more than a year If a few of the lyrics miss poetry in an obvious effort at sophistication that is a natural enough error in the first book of a very young poet and one that Mr Gilbert has no doubt already outgrown while rubbing shoulders with reality It is the several poems on Germany that are most appealing In Prussians Don t Believe in Dreams to which POETRY gave an honorable mention last November and in Germany is a fresh and wholly delightful naivete of wonder that Grimm s people and Heine s should show themselves as the Germans of these years There is light heartedness and whimsical   humor in Irish Kisses and John a Dreams and in Wars Are for Youth to Wage a note at once more personal and of greater universality  Wars are for Youth to wage not even Death Can make of war a greater thing than Youth So that when It comes walking in the dawn Some lad will laugh exulting to be gone In witness to the youngest ageless truth That honor is more beautiful than breath  A book of unusual promise  Verses in Peace and War by Shane Leslie Charles Scribner s Sons A strain thin but clear may be heard in this tiny volume  like a reed note at evening Some of the poems are devotional The Trinity Holy Cross and Saint John the Baptist for example And there are love poems and epitaphs for soldiers all unmistakably even poignantly sincere In this one a dead sentry begins the dialogue  Who passeth here We of the new brigade Who come in aid to take your place who fell What is the countersign That we have weighed The cost ye paid yet come Pass all is well  And here is a singularly beautiful epitaph for an aviator  Another one of mortal birth Hath set his spirit free Lie very lightly on him Earth Who did not tread on thee  Th e book has a quiet distinction  Loves and Losses of Pierrot by William Griffith Robert  J Shores   V  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  City Pastorals and Other Poems by William Griffith  Jas T White amp Co  It would be interesting to trace to its sources the Pierrot legend one of the frailest flowers of mediaevalism These little masquers Pierrot Columbine and the rest are like to live longer in men s gratitude than many doers of great deeds Airy symbols puff balls soap bubbles they float on destructive winds and survive the storms  Sometimes not always Mr Griffith s touch is light enough for these fragile shades I like especially two or three which POETRY has printed under other titles Tryst and Pierrette in Memory  In the later book City Pastorals provokes too ready a comparison with John Davidson s Fleet Street Eclogues Its rhymed dialogue and its following the seasons with talk about it and about are in the same vein but it twiddles the strings on which Davidson struck big stirring music Among the Other Poems in spite of their rather monotonous facility one finds now and then a fine flower on a slender stem  Green Fruit by John Peale Bishop Sherman French amp  Co  Perhaps this young poet was in too much of a hurry to publish his first book much of this fruit is indeed green But since he is also a soldier soon to be in France he may be justified in taking out this spiritual insurance against the risks of war Here is his mood in an envoy To Townsend Martin   I had many things to give you cinnabar and cassia  And such fruits as round and ripen in the sunnier air  I had many songs to sing you but I know not what they were  Here my gifts are take or leave them for I go another way  Some of the poems show more promise There is a delicate lyricism in one or two of the Elspeth series or Music or The Birds of Paradise  The Dreamers and Others Poems by Theodosia Garrison  Geo H Doran Co  Theodosia Garrison is better known to the readers of magazines than the poets above mentioned In fact she is in danger of standardizing her product for the poems in her book are mostly too easy too much alike I like her best in the frankly Irish poems a bit tender or whimsical at the end of the book H M  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  BAITING THE PUBLIC  The true identity of the Spectrists is now revealed I don t know how many were taken in by the hoax I know that Mr William Marion Reedy devoted an apparently serious review to Spectra when it appeared and last summer Mr Alfred Kreymborg the founder of Others assured me solemnly that Emanuel Morgan and Anne Knish were not pseudonyms but the real names of real persons that he had had letters from them and that he had actually met I think he said Elijah Hay a third Spectrist who with the other two had furnished the entire contents of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the Spectrist number of Others published in January 1917 Whether he was in the secret or not I do not know but I do know that he maintained an incredulous front wheninsisted that the author of Spectra was none other than Mr Witter Bynner who was thus performing as a skilled ventriloquist with a puppet on each knee I had not suspected the connivance of Mr Arthur Davison Ficke And I have not yet learned who impersonated Elijah Hay perhaps indeed he was born of the union of Emanuel Morgan and Anne Knish At any rate Mr Bynner and Mr Ficke must have had some amusement out of the joke if it was as successful as it is said to have been which seems incredible  And yet there is no reason why one should not have supposed Emanual Morgan and Anne Knish to be real persons for the poems in Spectra are no worse and no better and hardly any less intelligible than much of the free verse which has been thrust upon us If the joke proves anything at all it is simply that critics are an unselective lot particularly in the presence of the new poetry or new art about which there is a fair amount of uncertainty and which it is better to praise slightly than to damn utterly for one may find oneself running after the band wagon But would the result have been any different if one had put forth a book say of Prisms and Prunes very charming rhymed jingles the words making apparent sense syntax observed but with nothing underneath Certainly not For this happens every day People who actually do not   exist are often praised for writing verse of which they furnish the mere echo the originals being found tucked away on our library shelves  Spectra then proves nothing against the method of free verse as such though it may hit off very cleverly some of the practitioners thereof but if Prisms and Prunes were issued I doubt if anyone could see the point without having it explained and perhaps not then For one s mind is safely lulled to sleep by all that is apparently conventional and orthodox  What satisfaction is to be had I wonder from thus baiting the public Only the satisfaction of knowing that it is possible to do so which is after all axiomatic  A C H  A LATER WORD FROM DR PATTERSON  In an article on New Verse and New Prose in the North American Review Dr William Morrison Patterson ably supplements his book The Rhythm of Prose which was discussed in POETRY for April and sums up in the following final paragraphs the conclusions to which his researches are leading him We rejoice that he agrees with us in linking up the present free verse experiments with the ancient Anglo Saxon rhythms an authentic but long neglected tradition to which the present editor has paid tribute in her introduction to The New Poetry an Anthology  Unitary verse the elastic swing of which furnishes a key both to Miss Lowell s Painter on Silk and to the disputed rhythm of Beowulf   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  our most ancient epic metrical verse in which our later poets did their singing and conjuring spaced prose the oratorical and embroidering form of syncopating experience that characterizes so much current vers libre and finally fluid or normal prose such as we find for example in Addison in Macaulay and with singular perfection in Newman these are the four major genres Mosaics and blends polyphonic prose and polyphonic verse these are their permutations and combinations It is the discussion of vers libre however that has led us to our attempts at an analysis which we hope possesses some practical value for literary artists Our heart is with all poets metrical and free but we are particularly indebted just now to those of our contemporaries who have instinctively composed in these genres and thus helped us so materially to hear or to think we hear not only the music of everyday language the rhythm of its prose but also its ancestral cadence the forgotten swing of unitary verse  This lost child of our House of Rhythm after so long wandering unrecognized through the mosaic paths of the King James Version of William Blake of Walt Whitman of Synge and of Tagore s translations is worth being rescued and presented in proper integrity The final word as to this lies with the poets not the critics You have our affection however we may glare at you in the precincts of our dungeon laboratories Your generation is proving its gift of fire On the other hand they say in France that you lack technique and concentration Isn t this partly true Perhaps then you will be among the first to realize that you should feel your genres a little more distinctly and having felt them help the rest of us as the musical composer helps us and as Miss Lowell in several instances has helped us by employing a clearer notation such as long lines for spaced prose and shorter lines for unitary verse or any other device that will keep us straight as to our rhythmical whereabouts when we read you If in addition to this both you and your friends of more strictly metrical persuasion you of the flaming hearts you to whom things magically come will wait at times just a bit longer for the one right word be assured that D Annunzio s virgins vowed to St Apollinaris will burn not with such an ardor in their heavens of gold as we your humble worshippers shall burn in response to you We believe in you younger poets particularly and in your future for apart from our impressions of your vigor and sincerity surely it is a significant thing if in your newest songs we hear quite suddenly the harp of our ancestors   NOTES  Dr Frank S Gordon of Blairstown N J was introduced by POETRY in February of last year with a group of tribal songs from the Southwest Along the South Star Trail The present group is similarly inspired by a study of aboriginal music and admiration of the variety and freedom of Indian rhythm Of
