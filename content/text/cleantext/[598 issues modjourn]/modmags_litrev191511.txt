of all this turmoil and carnageOf course you know that we had the Zeppelins over LondonLet me give you my version of the affairIt was just after elevenWe were sitting in our little flatwhich is on the top floor of a building on the slope of Hampstead HillWe were reading I was savouringlike a true decadentthat over sweet honied Latin of the early Renaissance in an edition of 1513Could anything be more peacefulOur window was shut so the silence was absoluteSuddenly there was a Bangand a shrill wail That was pretty close said IBang whizz Bang whizz Shrapnel from the anti aircraft guns which are not five hundred yards from our house Of courselike boobieswe thought they were bombs I jumped up and got my coatand grabbed the door keyIt took hours to put out the lightAll the time Bang whizzIt seemed interminablethat descent of those four flights of stairsall the time with the knowledge that any second might see the whole damn place blown to hellWe could see the flashes of the guns and the searchlights as we passed the windows they were pointed straight at usThat meant that the Zeppelin was either right overhead or coming there Some excitementI tell youI shiver with excitement when I think of itWe stood at the porch for a few seconds very long seconds wondering what to doYou are supposed to get into the cellarsbut we haven t got cellarsand it s very risky in the streets from the flying shrapnelWe could see the long searchlights pointing to a spot almost overhead and the little red pinpricks of bursting shellsA man came down from one of the flats very calmwith field glassesto have a look at the animal Suddenly we saw itclear over headwith shells from three of four guns making little rosecoloured punctures in the air underneath itOne shell went nearvery nearthe Zeppelin swervedtiltedThey ve got itIt s coming down we all exclaimedIn the distance we could hear faint cheeringBut the Zeppelin righted itselfwaggled a littleand scenting danger made for the nearest cloud Apparentlya piece of shell had hit the pilotfor there was no apparent damage to be seen through the glassesThere were a few more bangs from the gunsfollowed by the cat squeals of the shells and the little explosions in the airThen silence as the Zeppelin got into a cloudthe searchlights looked wildly for itfor ten minutesThen they all went out and in the resulting darkness we could see the glow of the fires in LondonWhat rather detracts from our heroism is the fact that the Zeppelin had already dropped all its bombs in the middle of Londonbut we didn t know it till afterwardsI deduce these reflections1That as an engine of frightfulness the Zeppelin is over ratedAnd the damage it does is comparatively unimportant2That it is uncultured of the Germans to risk murdering the English Imagists and ruining the only poetic movement in Englandfor the sake of getting their names into the papers3That I notice I never go to bed now earlier than twelveand frequently go for a walk about eleven o clockI can t of course tell you where the bombs fellas it is strictly forbiddenStill I can say thisthat no public building of any kind was touchedthat it looks jolly well as if our Teutonic friends made a dead set at StPaul s and the British Museumthatwithout exceptionthe bombs fell on the houses of the poor and the very poor except for a warehouse or so and some officesthat one bomb fell near a block of hospitalscontaining paralytics and other cripples and diseased personssmashed all the hospital windowsand terrified the unhappy patients into hystericsthatlastlyit is a damned lie to say there are guns on StPaul s and the British Museum the buildings are too old to stand the shock of the recoilVoilaRemy de Gourmont is deadCamille de Saint Croix alsoIt is hard to write of friends recently deadThe experienced artist knows that inspiration is rare and that intelligence is left to complete the work of intuitionhe puts his ideas under the press and squeezes out of them the last drop of the divine juices that are in themand if need be sometimes he does not shrink from diluting them with clear water Romain Rolland Portrait of Theodore Dreiser ARTHUR DAVISON FICKE There were gilded Chinese dragons And tinkling danglers of glass And dirty marble topped tables Around usthat late night hourYou ate steadily and silently From a huge bowl of chop suey Of repellant aspect While I Iand another Told you that you had the style neither of William Morris Nor of Walter PaterAnd it was perfectly true But you continued to occupy yourself With your quarts of chop sueyAnd somehow you reminded me Of nothing so much as of the knitting women Who implacably counted stitches while the pride of France Went up to deathTonight I am aloneA long way from that Chinese restaurantA long way from wherever you areAnd I find it difficult to recall to my memory The image of your large laboring inexpressive faceFor I have just turned the last page Of a book of yoursA book large and superficially inexpressivelike yourselfIt has notany more than the old onesThe style of PaterBut now there are passing before me Interminable figures in tangled processionProud or cringingstarved with desire or icyHastening toward a dream of triumph or fleeing from a dream of doom Passing passing passing The Little Review Through a world of shadowsa chaotic and meaningless anarchyheavy clouds of terrific gloom through ravishing flashes of knife edged sunlightheads haloed with immortal illusion terrible and beautifulcruel and wonder laden illusion of lifeTheodore Dreiser JOHN COWPER POWYS estimating the intrinsic value of a book like TheGeniusand generally of a writer like Theodore Dreiserit is advisable to indulge in a little gentle introspectionCriticism need not always impose itself as an artbut it must at least conform to some of the principles that govern that form of human activity The worthlessness of so much energetic modern criticism is that it proceeds like scum from the mere surface of the writer s intelligenceIt is true that all criticism resolves itself ultimately into a matter of tastebut one has to discover what one s taste really isand that is not always easyTaste is a living thingan organic thingIt submits to the laws of growthand its growth is fostered or retarded by many extraneous influencesIn regard to the appreciation of new and original works of artit belongs to the inherent nature of taste that it should be enlargedtransmutedand undergo the birth pangs of a species of re creationIn the presence of a work of art that is really unusualin an attempt to appreciate a literary effect that has never appeared beforeone s taste necessarily suffers a certain embarrassment and uneasinessIt suffers indeed sometimes a quite extreme discomfortThis is inevitableThis is rightThis means that the creative energy in the new thing is getting to work upon usunloosening our prejudices and enlarging our scopeSuch a process is attended by exquisite intellectual excitementIt is also attended by a certain rending and tearing of personal vanityOne is too apt to confuse the existing synthesis of one s aesthetic instincts with the totality of one s being and this is a fatal blunder for who can fathom the reach of that circumferenceAnd it is of the nature of all syntheses to change and growYeton the other handnothing is more ridiculous and ineffective than the kind of hand to mouth criticism which attempts to eliminate its own pastand to snatch at the glow and glamour of a work of artas it werede vacuo and out of misty cloudsIf one wishes to catch the secret of true criticism if one s criticism is to be something more than a mere howl of senseless condemnation or yawp of still more senseless praiseone must attempt to do what Goethe and Saint Beuve and Brandes and Pater were always doing that is to sayto make every use of every traditionour ownas well as that of classical authorityand then carry all this a littlejust a littlefurthergiving it the shudder and the thrilling interest of the process of organic growthWithout traditionthe tradition of our own determined taste and the tradition of classical tastethere can be no growthOracles uttered in neglect of theseare oraclesin vacuo without meaning or substance without roots in human experienceWhether we are pleased to acknowledge it or notour own gradually evolved taste is linked at a thousand points with the classical taste of the agesIn criticizing new work we can no more afford to neglect such tradition thanin expressing our thoughtswe can afford to neglect languageTradition is the language of criticismIt can be carried further every original work of artby producing a new reaction upon itnecessarily carries it furtherBut it cannot be swept asideor we are reduced to dumbness to such vague growls and gestures as animals might indulge inCriticismto carry any intelligible meaning at allmust use the language provided by the centuriesThere is no other language to useand in default of language we are reducedas I have saidto inarticulate noisesThe unfortunate thing isthat much of the so calledcriticismof our day is nothing better than such physiological gesticulationIn criticismas in lifea certain degree of continuity is necessaryor we become no more than arbitrary puffs of windwho may shriek one day down the chimneyand another day through a crack in the doorbut in neither case with any intelligible meaning for human earsIn dealing with a creative quality as unusual and striking as that of Theodore Dreiserit is of absolutely no critical value to content ourselves with a crude physical disturbance on the surface of our mindswhether such disturbance is favourable or unfavourable to the writerIt isfor instancequite irrelevant to hurl condemnation upon a work like theGeniusbecause it is largely preoccupied with sexIt is quite equally irrelevant to lavish enthusiastic laudations upon it because of this preoccupationA work of art is not good because it speaks daringly and openly about things 9 The Little Review that shock certain mindsIt is not bad because it avoids all mention of such thingsAn artist has a right to introduce into his work what he pleases and to exclude from his work what he pleasesThe question for the critic isnot what subject has he selectedbut how has he treated that subjecthas he made out of it an imaginativesuggestiveand convincing work of artor has he not There is no other issue before the critic than this and if he supposes there isif he supposes he has the smallest authority to dictate to a writer what his subject shall be he is simply making a fool of himselfThere is an absurd tendency among some of us to suppose that a writer is necessarily a great writer because he is daring in his treatment of sexThis is quite as grotesque an illusion as the opposite onethat a great writer must be idealistic and upliftingThere is not the remotest reason why he should concern himself with sex if he prefers as did Charles Dickens for instance to deal with other aspects of lifeOn the other hand there is not the least reason why he should beuplifting Let him be an artist an artist that is the important matterAll these questions concerningsubjectsare tedious and utterly triflingIn theGeniusTheodore Dreiser has achieved a very curious and a very original workIn doing it he has once more made it clear how much more interesting the quality of his own genius is than that of any other American novelist of the present ageTheGeniusis an epic workIt has the epic rather than the dramatic qualityit has the epic rather than the mysticor symbolicqualityAnd strictly speakingDreiser s novelsespecially the later onesare the only novels in Americaare the only novelsas a matter of factin England or Americawhich possess this qualityIt is quite properly in accordance with the epic attitude of mindwith the epic quality in artthis reduction of the more purely human episodes to a proportionate insignificance compared with the general surge and volume of the life streamIt is completely in keeping with the epic quality that there should be no far fetched psychologyno quivering suspensions on the verge of the unknownDreiser is concerned with the mass and weight of the stupendous life tidethe life tide as it flows forwardthrough vast panoramic stretches of cosmic sceneryBoth in respect to human beingsand in respect to his treatment of inanimate objectsthis is always what most dominatingly interests himYou will not find in Dreiser s books those fascinating arrests of the onward sweeping tidethose delicate pauses and expectanciesin backwaters and enclosed gardenswhere personswith diverting twists in their brainsmurmur and meander at their easeprotected from the great streamNobody in the Dreiser world is so protected nobody is so privilegedThe great stream sweeps them all forwardsweeps them all away and not theybut Itmust be regarded as the hero of the taleIt is precisely this qualitythis subordination of the individual to the deep waters that carry himwhich makes Dreiser so peculiarly the American writerPerhaps this is one of the reasons why he has had a more profoundly appreciative hearing in England than in the United StatesIt was so with Walt Whitman in his earlier daysTo get the adequate perspective for a work so entirely epical it seems necessary to have the Atlantic as a modifying foregroundAmericans so entirely in it themselves are naturallyunless they possess the Protean faculty of the editor of Reedy s Mirrorunable to see the thing in this cosmic lightThey are misled by certain outstanding details the sexual scenesfor instance or the financial scenesand are prevented by theseas by the famousCataloguesin Whitmanfrom getting the proportionate visionThe true literary descendants of the author of the Leaves of Grass are undoubtedly Theodore Dreiser and Edgar MastersThese twoand these two alonethough in completely different wayspossess that singularbe yond good and eviltouch which the epic form of art requiresIt was just the same with Homer and Vergilwho were as naturally the epic children of aristocratic agesas these are of a democratic oneAchilles is not really a very attractive figure take him all in all and we remember how scandalously AEneas behaved to DidoThe ancient epic writerswriting for an aristocracycaught the world stream from a poetic angleThe modern epic writerswriting for a democracycatch it from a realistic oneBut it is the same world stream and in accordance with the epic vision there is the same subordination of the individual to the cosmic tideThis is essentially a dramaticrather than an epic epochand that is why so many of us are bewildered and confused by the Dreiser methodTheGeniusis a long bookBut it might have been three times as longIt might begin anywhere and stop anywhereIt is the Prose Iliad of the American Sceneandlike that otherit has a right to cut out its segment of the shifting panorama at almost any pointAnd so with the style of the thingIt is a ridiculous mis statement for critics to say that Dreiser has no styleIt is a charming ironyon his own partto belittle his styleHe hasas a matter of facta very definite and a very effective styleIt is a style that lends itself to the huge indifferent piling up of indiscriminate materialsquite as admirably as that gracious poetical one of the old epic makers lent itself to their haughtier and more aristocratic purposeOne would recognize a page of Dreiser s writings as infallibly as one would recognize a page of Hardy sThe former relaxes his medium to the extreme limit and the latter tightens his but they both have theirmanner A paragraph written by Dreiser would never be mistaken for anyone else sIf for no other peculiarity Dreiser s style is remarkable for the shamelessness with which it adapts itself to the drivel of ordinary conversationIn the Dreiser books especially in the later oneswhere in my humble opinion he is feeling more firmly after his true waypeople are permitted to say those things which they actually do say in real life things that make you blush and howlso soaked in banality and ineptitude are theyIn the true epic manner Dreiser gravely puts down The Little Review all these fatuous observationsuntil you feel inclined to cry aloud for the maddestthe most fantasticthe most affected Osconian witto serve as an antidoteBut one knows very well he is rightPeople don t in ordinary lifecertainly not in ordinary democratic life talk like Oscar Wildeor utter deep ironic sayings in the style of Matthew ArnoldThey don t reallylet this be well understood concentrate their feelings in bitter pungent spasmodic outburstsas those Rabelaisean persons in Guy de MaupassantThey just gabble and gibber and drivelat least that is what they do in England and AmericaThe extraordinary language which the lovers in Dreiser we use the termloversin large sense use to one another might well make an aesthetic minded person howl with nervous rageBut thenand who does not know itthe obsession of the sex illusion is above everything else a thing that makes idiots of peoplea thing that makes them talk like Simple SimonsIn real life lovers don t utter those wonderful pregnant sayings which leap to their lips in our subtle symbolic dramasThey just burble and blather and blurt forth whatever drivelling nonsense comes into their headsDreiser is the true master of the modern American Prose Epic just because he is not afraid of the wearinessthe stalenessthe flatnessand unprofitableness of actual human conversationIn reading the great ancient poetic epics one is amazed at thenaivetewith which these haughty persons these gods and demi gods express their emotional reactionsIt iscarried off of coursethereby the sublime heightening of the stylebut it produces just the same final impression of the insignificance of the individualwhether mortal or immortalcompared with the torrent of Fate which sweeps them all alongAnd the same thing applies to Dreiser s attitude towardsgood and eviland towards the problem of thesupernatural Al l other modern writers array themselves on this side or thatThey either defend traditional morality or they attack itThey are anxiousat all coststo give their work dramatic intensitythey struggle to make it ironicalsymbolicalmystical God knows whatBut Dreiser neither attacks morality nor defends immoralityIn the true Epic manner he puts himself asideand permits the great mad Hurly Burly to rush pell mell past him and write its own whirligig runes at its own careless pleasureEven Zola himself was not such a realistZola had a purposethe purpose of showing what a Beast the human animal isDreiser s people are not beastsand they shock our aesthetic sensibilities quite as often by their human sentiment as they do by their lapses into lecheryTo a European mind there is something incredibly absurd in the notion that these Dreiser books are immoralUnlike the majority of French and Russian writers Dreiser is not interested in the pathology of viceHe is too deeply imbued with the great naive epic spirit to stop and linger in these curious bye pathsHe holds Nature in her normal moods to be sufficiently remarkableIt is the same with his attitude towards thesupernatural The American Prose Epic were obviously false to reality if the presence of the supernatural were not feltIt is felt and felt very powerfullybut it is kept in its placeLike Walt Whitman s stellar constellationsit suffices for those who belong to itit is right enough where it is we do not want it any nearer Because the much tossed wandererEugene Witladraws a certain consolationat the lastfrom Christian Scienceonly a very literal person would accuse the author of TheGeniusof being a convert to the faithTo omit Christian Science from any prose epic of American life would be to falsify the picture out of personal prejudiceDreiser has no prejudices except the prejudice of finding the normal man and the normal womanshuffled to and fro by the normal forces of lifean interesting and arresting spectacleTo some among us such a spectacle is not interestingWe must have the excitement of the unusualthe shock of the abnormalWell There are plenty of European writers ready to gratify this tasteDreiser is not a European writerHe is an American writerThe life that interests himand interests him passionatelyis the life of AmericaIt remains to be seen whether the life of America interests Americans It is really quite important to get the correct point of view with regard to Dreiser sstyle The negative qualities in this style of his are indeed as important as the positive onesHe is so epicalso objectiveso concrete and indifferentthat he is quite content when the great blocked out masses of his work lift themselves from the obscure womb of being and take shape before himWhen they have done thiswhen these piled up materials and portentous groups of people have limned themselves against the grey backgroundhe himself stands asidelike some dim demiurgic forger in the cosmic blast furnaceand mutters queer commentaries upon what he seesHe utters these commentaries through the lips of his characters Cowperwoodsayor Witla or even some of the less important ones and broken and incoherent enough they areBut what matter The huge epic canvas is stretched out there before usThe vast cyclopean edifice lifts its shadowy bulk towards the grey skyThe thing has been achievedThe creative spirit has breathed upon the watersResting from his titanic laborwhat matter if this Demiurge drowsesand with an immense humorous indifference permits his characters to nod tooand utter strange words in their dreams The carelessness of Dreiser s styleits large indolenceits contempt for epigrammatic pointits relaxed strengthis not really a defect at all when you regard his work from the epic view pointThere must be something in a great cosmic picture to take the place of the sand and silt and rubbish and rubble which we know so well in lifeunder the grey sky And these stammered incoherencesthese broken mutteringsfill in this gapThey give the picture that drab patiencethat The Little Review monotonous spaciousness which is requiredSymbolic drama or psychological fiction can dispense with these blank surfacesThe prose epic of America cannot afford to do without themThey suggest that curious sadnessthe sadness of largeflatfeatureless scenerywhich visitors from Europe find so depressingWellThus it remainsIf one is interested in theurge urgeurge as Whitman calls itof the normal life stream as it goes upon its wayin these American Statesone reads Dreiser with a strange pleasureHe is no more moral than the normal life stream is moraland he is no more immoralIt is true the normal life stream does not cover quite the whole fieldThere are back waters and there are enclosed gardensThere was a Europe onceBut the American prose epic is the American prose epicSo W e Grew Together EDGAR LE E MASTERS Reading over your letters I find you wrote meM y dear boy or at timesdear boy and the envelope

away With a glittering hardnessperhaps you thought I kept you away for I was moving In spheres you knew notliving through Beliefs you believed in no moreand ideals That were just mirrors of unrealitiesAs a boy can be I was critical of youAnd reasons for your failures began to arise In my mind I saw specific facts here and there With no philosophy at hand to weld them And synthesize them into one truthAnd a rush of the strength of youth Deluded me into thinking the world Was something so easily understood and managed While I knew it not at all in truthAnd an adolescent egotism Made me feel you did not know me Or comprehend the all that I wasAl l this you divined So it wentAnd when I left you and passed To the worldthe city still I see you With eyes avertedand feel your hand Limp

itsqueezes all the nectar From the grapesIt seemed you d never lose This power and sense of joybut yet at times I saw another phase of you There was the day We rode together north of the old townPast the old farm houses that I knewPast maple grovesand fields of corn in the shockAnd fields of wheat with the fall greenIt was Octoberbut the clouds were summer sLazily floating in a sky of JuneAnd a few crows flying here and thereAnd a quail s calland around us a great silence That held at its core old memories Of pioneersand dead daysforgotten thingsI ll never forget how you looked that dayYour hair Was turning silver nowbut still your eyes Burned as of oldand the rich olive glow In your cheeks shonewith not a line or wrinkle You seemed to me perfection a youtha manAnd now you talked of the

we said butyesorno That was enoughwe smoked together And drank a glass of wine and watched The leaves fall sitting on the porch Then life whirled me away like a leafAnd I went about the crowded ways of New YorkAnd one night Alberta and I took dinner At a place near Fourteenth Street where the music Was like the sun on a breeze swept lake When every wave is a patine of fireAnd I thought of you not at all Looking at Alberta and watching her white teeth Bite off bits of Italian breadAnd watching her smile and the wide pupils Of her eyeselectrified by wine And music and the touch of our hands Now and then across the tableWe went to her house at lastAnd through a languorous eveningWhere no light was but a single candleWe circled about and about a pending theme Till at last we solved it suddenly in rapture Almost by chanceand when I left She followed me to the hall and leaned above The railing about the stair for the farewell kissAnd I went into the open air ecstaticallyWith the stars in the spaces of sky between The towering buildingsand the rush Of wheels and clang of bellsStill with the fragrance of her lips and cheeks And glinting hair about medelicate And keen in spite of the open airAnd just as I entered the brilliant car Something said to me you are deadI had not thought of youwas not thinking of youBut I knew it was trueas it was For the telegram waited me at my roomI didn t

emotionalism for the sake of emotionI recalled blushingly the confession of our chief Neo Hellenistwho is moved aesthetically by any sort of musicwhether it emanates from Kreisler s Stradivarius or from the pianola at Henrici sI confess I am a fastidious loverThe dearer a person or a thing are to me the more I demand from themthe more painfully I am hurt by their flawsHence the number of my dislikes exceeds that of my likesHence I grit my teeth at the sight of Maria Gay in CarmenBecause the music of that opera is so full of eternal symbols to mebecause when listening to it I understand why Nietzsche preferred Bizet to WagnerI am scalded by its vulgar cabaretizationHad I not been stirred by MrPowysremarkable liturgy of StOscar WildeI would not have been so keenly pricked by his subsequent remark in his Verlaine lecture that Rimbaud was a ruffianIt is because I cannot live without music that I am compelled to suffer weekly indigestion from the sauerkraut menus furnished by MrStock s bâtonWill MrScavenger of the rug philosophy expect me not to swear and damn at the prospect of being doomed to a long season of MeistersingersPerambulatorsGoldmarckian fudgeBrahmsian AcademicsStockian Jubilee Confettiand similar insults Let me touch another sore the Little Theatrethe Temple of Living Artto which I have looked up with reverence and hope the only theatrical organization in the city that seemed to have other considerations outside of box receiptsI was present at the opening night of this seasonand left the littlecatacombwith an aching heartWhat reasonwhat artistic reasonis there to stage Andreyev s Sabine Women anywhere outside of RussiaThe play was written as a biting satire against the Russian liberals who fought against the government with Tolstoy an Non Resistance instead of joining the revolutionary proletariatIn Andreyev s land he is perfectlypainfully understoodbut hereon Michigan Avenuethe satire degenerated into a boring burlesqueEven Raymond Johnson s suggestivegraceful horizons fail to save the situationAs to Lithuania what is the matter with the Little Theatre malesThey move and speak like hermaphroditesthey drink vodka and swear in squeaking falsettoesthey appear so feeble and effeminate in comparison with the virilegruesome Ellen Van Volkenburg and Miriam KipperThenhow realistic shades of ZolaMaurice Browne vomits so

he lauds and affirmshis voice thins to that of a sick puppyHe should be administered cure from his mania of showering superlatives upon false gods and counterfeit prophetsI dislike the role of a Good Samaritanbut our Scavenger is so youngso impressionableperhaps he will repentBesidesI sympathize with himHe is one of those promising Americans who suffocate in their native atmosphereor lack of atmosphereand are easily lured and led astray by will othe wispsIn his yearning for wings he is apt to proclaim a domestic rooster as an eaglein his craving for sunfor lighthe often mistakes a cardboard butaforial sun for Phoebus ApolloHence his admiration for that Arch BorrowerHuneker He is one of the two or three American critics that are above Puritanic provincialismthat are broadEuropean exclaims ScavengerIt is truebut this truth serves only as a testimonia pauperitatis for the intellectual state of this countrywhere glittering counterfeit coins are less odious than Simon pure AmericanismThe Huneker cult is one of the American tragedies of which I have spoken on other occasionsthe tragedy of surrogatesThe young generationseething with longing for the great and the beautiful in life and artis forced to feed on substitutes in the absence of real quantitiesThey want to read a living word about Verlaineabout Huysmansabout Matisseabout those winged titans who make Trans Atlantic life so rich and pulsatingand they turn to Hunekerthe great concocter of newspaper clippings and boulevard gossipWhen Scavenger read for me Huneker s admirable essay on Huysmans I was not yet aware that whatever was admirable in the essay had been borrowed almost in toto from Havelock Ellis s AffirmationsWhy use the secondAffirmationsby Havelock EllisBostonHoughton MifflinThe first edition of the book was issued about twenty years agoyet or third hand patched up cloak of Boulevardier Hunekerwhen you may drink from the very sourcefrom Arthur Symonsfrom Havelock Ellisfrom ohwellwho can recount them Ahthe tragedy of substitutes The other eveningat a gathering ofThe Questioners I accused Miss Harriet Monroe and Miss Margaret CAnderson of being too lenient editorsin not trying to mould the taste of their contributorsWhat conscientious editor would allow a writer of Scavenger s caliber to descend to the irritating rhetoric ofThe Dionysian Dreiser To print this loud exaggeration immediately after Ben Hecht s Songs and Sketches is to profess the rug philosophyThe Scavengeras most of his colleaguesis a reformed PuritanHe finds boyish delight in reading an author who is a professional fence wrecker and convention smasherTo him immoralizing is a virtue per seHe hails Dreiser as the greatestfor things that he has not doneDreiser is a genius because he has not followed the conventional novelist who makes his villain repent or perishI admit thisbut such a negative virtuesignificant as it may appear in given conditionsdoes not qualify an artistTheGeniusis not artIt is instructiveit is of great value for the study of contemporary Americaas MrMasters pointed outI can imagine that in the twerity first century TheGeniuswill be used as a textbook for the history of the United States in the end of the nineteenth centuryfor the author has minutely depicted our customs and moralshas gone into detailed description of country and city lifeof farmersmenuesof stomach aches and their cureof Christian Science wondersof salaries and pricesof all the infinitesimal particles that compose the mosaïque of mediocre lifeInstructive yesbut art by no meansLet me quote Havelock Ellis sAffirmationsThree strokes with the brush of Frans Hals are worth a thousand of Denner sRich and minute detail may impress usbut it irritates and wearies in the endWhen we are living deeplythe facts of our external life do not present themselves to us in elaborate detail a very few points are as it has been termed focal in consciousnesswhile the rest are marginal in subconsciousnessA few things stand out vividly at each moment of lifethe rest are dimThe supreme artist is shown by the insight and boldness with which he seizes and illuminates these bright points at each stageleaving the marginal elements in due subordinationTruismsaren t theseI wish Dreiser the greatest and his hailers would ponder over them before they apply the term art to 736 pages devoted to rumination of what Ellis callsmarginal elementsof lifeAnd what one reads it now with keen joyWith the exception of the essay on Nietzschewhich is somewhat obsoletethe essay on ZolaHuysmansCasanovaand StFrancis have stood the test of timeOne feels the breeze of cleannessfreshnesssincerityand profundityI may have an opportunity of discussing the book some other time23 a

rightHe is an artistHe loves beautiful thingsSeeGod damn you Is he Throughout the long book we are told time and again that he is an artistUnless we take the author s word for it we are inclined to doubt it very muchTruean artist loves beautybut does he necessarily desire to possess the object of his admirationDoes not the contemplation of a beautiful arm or sunset or flower or vase or rug bring the artist complete satisfaction and possessionI do not condemn Witlaalthough I dislike himfor he is a loud mediocrityThere is a Witla in every one of us menbut we take our Witla as our animalistic selfnot as the artisticAhdear ScavengerI do love rugsBut there are rugs and rugsThe Scavenger s Swan Song What a remarkable fellow my friend the Incurable isI talk to him about rugsquite casuallyas we wait for a carand what does this devil of a psychologist do but walk deep into my soul on one of themI read him a Huneker article on Huysmans which he remarks is excellent at the timeonly to

shapeless bodies waddled along on their way to marketBearded old men who looked like the fathers of Jerusalem walked flatfootednodding back and forth The tread of the processional surviving in Halsted street thought Moissethe young dramatist who was moving with the crowdChildren sprawled in the refuse laden alleysOne of them ragged and clotted with dirt stood half dressed on the curbing and urinated into the streetWagons rumbledfilled with fruits and iron and rags and vegetablesHuman voices babbled above the noises of the trafficMoisse watched the lively scene Every day it s the same he thought the same smellsthe same noise and people swarming over the pavementsI am the only one in the street whose soul is awakeThere s a pretty girl looking at meShe suspects the condition of my soulHer fingers are dirtyWhy doesn t she buy different shoesShe thinks I am lostIn five years she will be fatIn ten years she will waddle with a shawl over her head The young dramatist smiled Good God he thought where do they come fromWhere are they goingNo place to no placeBut always movingshufflingwaddlingcrying outThe sun shines on themThe rain pours on themIt burnsIt freezesToday they are bright with colorTomorrow they are grey with gloomBut they are always the samealways in motion The young dramatist stopped on the corner and looking around him spied a figure sitting on the sidewalkleaning against the wall of a buildingThe figure was an old manHe had a long white beardHe had his legs tucked under him and an upturned tattered hat rested in his lapHis thin face was raised and the sun beat down on itbut his eyes were closed Asleep mused MoisseHe moved closer to himThe man s head was covered with long silky white hair that hung down to his neck and hid his earsIt was uncombedHis face in the sun looked like the face of an asceticthinfinely veinedHe had a long nose and almost colorless lips and the skin on his cheeks was whiteIt was drawn tight over his bonesleaving few wrinklesAn expression of peace rested over him peace and detachmentOf the noise and babble he heard nothingHis eyes were closed to the crowded frantic streetHe sathis head backhis face bathed in the sunsmileless and dreaming A beggar thought Moisse asleepobliviousDeadAll day he sits in the sun like a saintimmobileLike one of the old Alexandrian asceticslike a delicately carved imageHe is awake in himself but dead to othersThe waves cannot touch himHis thoughtsoh to know his thoughts and his dreams Suddenly the eyes of the young dramatist widenedHe was looking at the beggar s long hair that hung to his neck It s moving he whispered half aloudHe came closer and stood over the old man and gazed intently at the top of his headThe hair was swaying faintlyeach separate fiber moving aloneIt shiftedrose imperceptibly and fellIt quivered and glided Lice murmured MoisseHe watchedSilent and asleep the old man sat with his thin face to the sun and his hair movedVermin swarmed through it creepingcrawlingtiny and infinitesimalEvery strand was palpitatingshuddering under their mysterious energyAt first Moisse could hardly make them out but his eyes gradually grew accustomed to the sightAnd as he watched he saw the hair swell like waves riding over the watersaw it drop and fluttercoil and uncoil of its own accordVermin raised it uppulled it outstreaming up and down tirelessly in vast armiesThey crawled furiously like dust specks blown thick through the white beardThey streamed and shifted and were never stillThey moved in and outfrom no place to no placebut always movingfranticand frenziedAn old woman passed and with a shake of her head dropped two pennies into the upturned hatMoisse hardly saw herHe saw only the palpitating swarms that were now racingeasily visiblethrough the grey white hairSome ventured down over the white ascetic facecrawling in every directiontraveling around the lips and over the closed eyesemerging The Little Review 27 suddenly in thick streams from behind the covered ears and losing themselves under the ever moving beardAnd Moissehis senses strainedthought he heard a noise a faint crunching noiseHe listenedThe noise seemed to grow louderHe began to itch but he remained bending over the headHe could hear themlike a faraway murmura purringuncertain sound They re shouting and groaningcrying outweeping and laughing he mused It is life life He looked up and down the crowded burning street with its frantic crowdand smiled Life he repeatedHe walked awayBefore him floated the hair of the beggar moving as if stirred by a slow windand he itched But who was the old man he thoughtA young womanplump and smilingjostled himHe felt her soft hip pressing against him for a momentA child running barefoot through the street brushed against his legsHe felt its sticky fingers seize him for an instant and then the child was goneOn he walkedThree young men confronted him for a second timeHe passed between two of themsqueezed by their shouldersA shapeless old woman bumped him with her back as she shuffled pastTwo children dodged in and out screaming and seized his arm to turn onThe young dramatist stopped and remained standing stilllooking about himThen he laughed Life he murmured againandI am the old man he added I IDepths Crowds began to come out of the buildingsThey came in streams and broad wavesbreaking in a black sweep over the pavements and spreading into a thick long mass that moved forwardThe glassy lights cut the twilight drizzel with their yellow fireThe tumult grew until up and down the street an unceasing din soundedshriekingroaringclanging noisesMoissethe young dramatiststood against one of the office buildings as the throngs spilled past him on their ways homeHis eyes were fixed on the distant gloom of the sky which hung beyond the drizzel and the fuzzy glare of light like a vast black froth It is so silent mused Moisse Millions of miles without a soundMan and his accomplishments are infinitesimal went on the young dramatist as the swelling throng brushed and buffeted against him but his ego is infiniteOnly by thought can he reach the stars He was thoughtless for a momentholding his position with difficulty as the crowds pressed pastThen he resumedNone of them looks at meNone of them imagines I am thinking of the starsHow startled these fat evil smelling men and women would be if they could see my thought for a moment as they crashed along their tiny waysBut nevertheless I don t eat tonight he murmured suddenlyas if awakeningAnd the idea plunged him into a series of reflections from which he emerged with a frown and looked about himA short thick man with an unshaven face was shuffling pastHis skin was broken under his growth of beard with red and purple soresHis mouth hung openhis eyes stared ahead of him and his head was bent forwardMoisse thought of the body concealed by the layers of caked rags which covered the manand shuddered He never bathes mused the young dramatist I wonder what a creature like that does And he followed him slowlyAt the corner the man stopped and blew his nose violently with his fingersAnother block and he stopped againbending over in the midst of the crowd and straightening with a cigar butt in his handHe eyed the thing criticallyIt was flattened at the end where feet had passed over itThe man thrust it between his lips and shuffled onIn a vestibule he extracted a blackened match from his pocket and with shaking fingers lighted the buttWhen it burned he blew a cloud of smokeand taking it out of his mouth regarded it with satisfactionSeveral in the throng noticed himtheir eyes resting with disapproval and sometimes hate upon the figureOnce a crossing policeman spied him and followed him with his gaze until he was lost to viewMoisse kept abreast of him and together they turned into an alley that led behind a hotelThe man s eyes never waveredbut remained fixed in the direction he was movingThe alley was darkIn the court that ran behind the hotel were several largebattered cans that shone dully against the black wallDebris littered the groundLooking furtively at the closed doors the man made his way to one of the cansHe lifted the cover cautiously and thrust his arm into its depthsFor several minutes he remained with his arm lost inside the refuse can He s found something whispered MoisseThe man straightenedIn his hand he held an object on which sparks seemed to race up and down like blue insectsThe Little Review He raised his find to his face and then thrust it into his pocket and resumed his shuffle down the alley To think mused Moisse of a man eating out of a garbage canEither he is inordinately hungry or careless to a point of ofHe searched for a word that refused to appear and he followed slowly after the manIn the dim light of a side street the man paused and took out his bootyIt was evidently the back of a fowlStanding still the man thrust it into his mouthgnawing and tearing at its bonesAfter he had eaten for several minutes he held it up to the light and started picking at shreds of meat with his fingersThese he licked off his handThe meal was at length finishedThe man threw the gleaned bones awayblew his nose and walked onThrough the dark tumbled streets Moisse followedThe shuffling figure fascinated himHe noted the gradually increasing degradation of the neighborhoodthe hovels that seemed like tornblackened ragsthe broken streets piled with refuse and mudIn front of a lighted house the man stoppedThe curtains which hung over the two front windows of the house were tornOne of them was half destroyed and Moisse saw into the room in which a gas jet flickered and which was emptyThe man walked up the steps and knocked at the doorIt was openedA woman whispered MoisseShe vanishedand the man followed herThe two appeared in a moment in the room with the gas lightThe woman was tall and thinher hair hung down her back in two scimpy braidsHer face was coated with paint and great hollows loomed under her eyesThe man walked to herhis open mouth widened in a grin They re talking murmured the young dramatist as he watched their haggard faces move strangelyHe noted the woman was dressed in a wrappercolorless and streaked I wonder he beganbut the scene captured his attentionHe watched absorbedThe woman was shaking her head and backing away from the man who finally halted in the center of the roomHe lifted a foot from the floor and removed its shoeStanding with the shoe in his hand his eyes glistened at the woman who watched him with her neck stretched forward and a sneer on her lipsThe man put his hand in the shoe and brought out a coinA twenty five cent piece muttered MoisseThe man held it up in his fingers and laughedHis face distorted itself into strange wrinkles when he laughedMoisse who could not hear the laugh saw only an imbecilic grimaceThe woman took the coinand left the roomShe returned in a moment holding out her arms to the manHe seized hercrushing her body against him until she was bent backwardHe pressed his face over herhis mouth still openhis eyes staringThe woman stared back and laughedfastening her lips suddenly to hisLosing his balancethe man staggered and the woman broke from his graspHe pounced on herseizing her hand and jerking her against himAs she held back he raised his fist and struck her fiercely in the faceShe swayed for an instant and then stood quietHer lips began to smile and move in speechThe man shook his head rapturouslyrubbing his nose with a finger and pantingMoisse turned away and walked slowly toward the town Good God he murmured he ll take his clothes off and she His emotions began to trouble himAn unrest stirred his body I should have gone in there and taken her away from him he musedand then with a shudder he walked on smilingGratitude The avenue bubbled brightly under the grey rainThe afternoon crowd had melted from the sidewalkwashed into hallways and under awnings by the downpourIt began to look like eveningA refreshing gloom settled over the streetThe wind leaped out of alley courts and byways and raced over the pavement accompanied by spattering arpeggios of rainMoissethe young dramatistturned into the avenueHis voluminous black raincoatreaching from his ears to his shoe topsflapped in front of himBy exercising the most diligent efforthoweverhe managed rather to saunter than walkand he kept his eyes raptly fixed upon the deserted stretch of shining cementAs he moved peacefully along he repeated to himself The rain leaps and pirouttes like a chorus of Russian elvesIt jumpsIt bouncesIt hopsskipsand runsFlocks of little excited silver birds are continually alighting around my feet and chattering in a thousand voicesI should have been a poet Removing his gaze from the ground he looked at the faces which lined the buildings and floated like pale lamps in the darkened vestibules Everyone is watching me he thought for in my attitude there is the careless courage of an unconscious heroismI stroll along indifferent to the rainIt splashes down my neckIt takes the crease out of my trousersIt trickles off the brim of my hatThe Little ReviewAnd all this stamps me momentarily in these afflicted minds as an unusual human That one with the monogomistic side whiskers is wondering what a queer fellow I am What can it be that engrosses my attention to the point of making me so oblivious to the rainAnd that fat woman with the face like a toy balloon is certain I will catch my death of cold The little girl with the wide eyes thinks I am in love There is an infinite source of speculation in my simple conduct The water was making headway down the back of his neckbut Moisse hesitated and then abstained from adjusting his collar more firmly They will notice it he thought and immediately I will lose the distinctive aloofness which characterizes me now So moving leisurely down the avenue Moissethe young dramatistprogressedhis eyes apparently unconscious of the scene before himhis soul oblivious to the saturated worldand his mind occupied with distant and mysterious thoughtsThe downpour began to assume the proportions of a torrentMoisse persisted in his tracksSomeone touched his elbowHe turned and found a little old man with faded eyes and threadbaredripping clothes smiling earnestly at his sideThe little old man was bent in the shouldersHis shirt had no collarHis brown coat was buttoned to his neckHis face screwed up by a sensitiveness to the cataract of drops beating against itwas round and full of wrinklesIt had the quizzicalgoodnatured look of a fuzzy little dogHis wet eyes that seemed to be swimming in a red moisture peered at Moisse who was frowning I m hungry began the little old man I ain t had anything to eatHow much do you want inquired Moisse Anything said the beggarThe young dramatist felt in his pocketA single half dollar encountered his fingers I ve only got a half dollar he said I ll get it changedCome on The two of them walked in silenceMoisse still saunteringthe little old man bent over and looking as if he wanted to speak but was afraid of dissipating a dream Wait here Moisse said suddenly I ll go in and get change He stepped into the box office of one of the large moving picture theaters on the avenue and secured changeThe little old man had followed him inside the buildinghis eyes watching him with an eager curiosityMoisse turned with the change to find the beggar at his elbowHe handed him fifteen cents What s the matterhe inquired Been drinkingNono said the beggar Why haven t youpersisted Moisse frowning don t you know there s nothing for you but drinkThat s what drink is forMen like you The faded eyes livened Now you go and get yourself three good shots of booze went on Moisse and you ll be a new man for the rest of the day The beggar had become excitedHis lips moved in a nervous delight but he uttered no soundWith the fingers of his right hand he picked at the blackened and roughtly bitten nails of his otherHe cleared his throat and then as if suddenly inspiredremoved his drenched hat and raised his eyebrowsTouched by the sincerity of the little old man s emotions the young dramatist reached into his pocket and brought forth another ten cent piece Here he said buy two more drinks The little man seemed about to break into a danceHis face became tinged with the pink of an old woman s cheekThe red moisture ran out of his eyes in two white tearsMoisse regarded himfrowning Once you were young as I am today said Moisse aloudfastening his eyes upon the top of the little old man s head which seemed dirty and bald despite the pale hairand alive Perhaps you had ambitions and then some commonplace occurred and you lost themAnd now you float around begging nicklesThat s interestingA little old man begging nickles in the rain The beggar smiled eagerly and then ventured a slight laughHe came closer to Moisse and stood trembling Asking for crumbs went on Moisse with a deepening frown cursed at night when alone by memories that will not dieEhHe looked suddenly into the faded eyes and smiledThe little old man nodded his head vigorouslyHe caught his breath and stood looking at Moisse with his mouth open and his checks wrinkled as if he were about to cryHis breath struck the young dramatist and he averted his nose Strange resumed he now you have a quarter and I have a quarter and still we remain so differentIsn t it strangeold fellowYet it is the inevitable inequality of men that makes us brothers The beggar was about to speakMoisse paused and looked with interest at the round facethe quivering nostrils and the lips that were twitching into speech No one has talked to me like you he said no one The Little Review And he caught his breath and stared with a strange expression at his benefactorHe bit at a finger nail and lowered his headHe seemed suddenly in the throes of a great mental struggle for his face had become earnestIt endured for a moment and then he looked at Moisse You you want me to come along with you he said and he scratched at the back of his ear I ll come along if you want me to he repeated Come alongWhere Moisse askedhis eyes awakening Ohanyplace said the little old man I ain t particularif you ain t He was breathing quickly and he reached for the palm of his patronA deep light had come into his faceHis faded eyes had grown strongerTheir quizzical look was gone and they were burning in their wet depthsThey looked now with a maternal intensity into the eyes of Moisse and their smile staggered the sophistication of the young dramatistThe little old man continued to breathe hard until he began to quiverHe suddenly assumed command Come he saidseizing Moisse by the palm and squeezing it I know a place we can go and get a room cheap and where we won t be disturbedIt ain t so nice a place but come He squeezed the palm he held for the second timeThe deep light that had come into his little dog s face softened and two tears rolled again out of his eyesHe caught his breath in a sob I I don t drink he said I m hungry but I can wait until we get through He was beaming coquettishly through his tears and fondling the young dramatist s hand I can wait he repeatedraising his blue lips toward Moissehis face transfigured and glowing pink I see said Moissewithdrawing his hand with an involuntary shudderHe was about to say something but he turnedagain involuntarilyand hurried awaybreaking into a run when he found himself in the rainThe little old man s face droopedHe walked slowly staring after himHe stood bareheaded while the rain bombarded his drenched figure and he looked at the young dramatist runningWhile he stood gazing after him his face screwed up was suffused with a strange tenderness and the tears dripped out of his eyes Editorials and Announcement Emma Goldman at the Fine Arts Theatre Sunday nightNovember

utterancewas to devastate the suggestion that war is evilavoidableand should not be prepared for by military methodsMaurice Browne was to defend the suggestion Scarce half a moon before had the first murmuring of discontent arisen among the worshipers of the templewhen their idolbeautifulmordantflamingstrode forth in flapping black garments and proclaimed that in this great war of many nationsthe gall and vitriol and wormwood and uncleanness of mankind are burnedpurged from the purified flesh of humanitythat then humanity is transformeduntil the passion of hate is hardly distinguishable from

others stood up to indicate their opposite conviction The vote was on the merits of the questionThe Little Review 37 The Theatre THE WASHINGTON SQUARE PLAYERS SAXE COMMINS E I a self appointed apologist for the Washington Square Players I might be able to say with gracious fairness thattheir works are not worth as much as their endeavors but their endeavors are heroic But I am not inclined to pardon these enthusiasts whose enthusiasm has become cautiouswhose ideals are inoffensivewhose outlines are blurred by an undiscerning dilettantismwho in the absence of a dominant individual characteristic flounder helplessly through an unbalancedinartistic programthat is only relievedfortunatelyby MrPhil Moeller s delicious satire Helena s Husband It is not from what you emancipate yourselfit is for what Let us see whether the Washington Square Players have really liberated themselves from the Broadway tradition ofgetting it over from the sacrifice of the artistic for the opportuneand from the fear of offending the generous critics of the New York Press and incidentally a gullible public What have they done that has an element of daringinvigorating thought was asked of one of the members of the producing staff My Lady s Honorone of last year s plays was his answerTo those who were unfortunate enough to have seen this pseudo feminist tract George Broadhurst supplanting Ibsen in a free theatre I need not tell what resentment that rer mark arousedNor could those who saw Moondown on the same bill be more antagonized than I was when I heard so fatuous a statement asIf we had more plays like Moondown we would establish the equivalent in America to the Celtic renaissance Is thisfor whatthe Washington Square Players have emancipated themselves Even if Moondowm had any value in itself would they deserve any credit for an aspiration that is only a conditional imitation I take these casual expressions of members of the organization critically because there is a most noticeable absence of persistenthighly individualized effortbecause there is a majority rulethe odorlessness of an insipid mixture prevalent in the atmosphere about the Band BoxThey are successful unfortunatelyConsider the present billHas the play reading committee shown any distinction that differentiates it from those Broadway theatrical agencies that supply syndicated thrills on demandHave they not arranged their programme without any regard for balanceto the vaudeville formula in this mannerOne curtain raiser on a current topic of course the warone play cut and measured for the stara misfitto prepare you for the middle piecein this instance an amazingly clever satire by Phil Moeller and then the end upYesthey have outgrown Broadwaythey don t wave a big American flag as a grand finale numberin this spirit wouldn t a fancifully pagan thing be very nice to show that we have a conception of the beautiful Voilà the whole is the sum of its partsmathematically accurateyesbutwho knows whether two and two don t make fivein the science of Estheticsif there is such a thingWhereI cannot understandis their proclaimed aspiration of finding plays which fulfill the artistic merit that they would lead us to believe the New York theatre goer demandsIf there is such a publicdo they think and choose for them secure in the belief that the patient supporters of these sterile Little Theatre movements will abide such exploitationIs their complacency so complete that they can disregard every requirement that aNew Theatremovement imposes and yet get away with itWhen I use the termNew TheatreI mean it in the Strindbergian sensea new and thoroughly iconoclastic theatre that panders to no opinionwhose merit lies solely in an individual and artistic distinctiona theatre that has something of thecontinual slight novelty Fire and Waterthe opening play of the bill by Hervey Whiteis a sacrifice of art to the god of timelinessan inane argumentan undramatic episodea virtuous plea against War that permits its author to air some abstractions on brotherhood and equality with utter disregard for the tenseness or the dramatic possibilities of the situationBroadway knows betterTheyat leastare both opportune and spectacular and do not pour forth so much of what Nietzsche callsmoralic acid Night of Snowby Roberto Braccoseems chosen ostensibly to allow MrRalph Roeder to cover as great an area of the stage as is possible in forty five minutes of monotonous gesture to the melodious obligato of a voice ranting second rate Hamlet self lacerationsIt tells the story of a person half gentlemanhalf derelictwho likes to cry about it while his mistress and mother indulge themselves to satiation with sickly sweet sacrifice I am his Mo ho theretceteraWhat a relief was Moeller s playa play that could not even be contaminated by its environmentI think Anatole France would be glad to have written itHelena s Husband is much more than an historical interpretation of a phase of the Trojan warsIt is the truth Moeller is more than cleverHe knows as well as France thathistory is a pack of lies The Antickby Percy Mackayeis a devitalized Pagan attempt which in spite of charming Lupokova was extremely tediousI heard little of itso poor was the enunciation of the actorsand for my concentrated attention I was rewarded with an incoherent effort to transplant Pan to barrencolorless New EnglandI wonder whether MrMackaye ever read Pater s Deny s L AuxerroisThe Little Review At least the Washington Square Players presume to desireeven though it be in a misdirected mannerWill they overcome the affable praise that they get so generously from uncritical critics Will they mature sufficiently to recognize the mistakes of their infancy There is still hope that they can be saved from successWhere is the strongperhaps tyrannicalindividual who can do it LithuaniaWhoever hasn t seen the Little Theatre s production of Rupert Brooke s Lithuania has missed an excellent although unimportant dramatic treatIt is the mosteffectivething of its kind I ever have seen executed in Chi t cagoIt is one prolonged and unrelieved shudder from start to finishRupert Brooke is the hero of the occasionHis play is the thingThe theme is that of the guest who stops over in an outlying peasant hut and is murdered in his chamber while he sleepsBrooke added a flourish in making the guest a returned son of the house who vanished when he was thirteenTaking this hackneyed idea Brooke moulded it with consummate skillAnd the result is a study in horror and pathologyvividartistic and for its effect upon the audience to be compared only to the witnessing of a child birthThree of its actors rose to its demandsMrsBrowne as the lame daughter contributed practically all the human atmosphere there wasMiriam Kipper abetted herAllan MacDougalin the part of a halfwitted son of a tavern keeperadded a few excellent momentsThe other men werehoweverentirely unsuccessful in their effortsMaurice Browneas the peasant fatherfailed with the rest of them to give the impression the play demandedsullengrimviriledespondencyBut it was theredespite themA n Objection Why is it people have such stupid reactions to the plays put on by the Chicago Little TheatreI do not knowIt is easy to explain why they talk in subdued tones while enteringwhy they almost walk on tip toewhy they ask for the programs almost with aweand whysometimesthey stop their chatter as the lights are slowly dimmedThe causes of these actions and their explanation are obviousAnd yet after the playWhat inanehalf witted remarks about the billThisnoticeprinted above about the opening bill of their fourth season what is it worth as a piece of criticismas a reviewor even as an account of the proceedings it so tritely and knowingly pretends to explain MrsBrowne as the lame daughter Miriam Kiper abetted herMacDougall added a few excellent moments Maurice Browne failed with the rest of them What rotIn watching Brooke s play you are not aware that you are watchingMrsBrowne as the lame daughteror Miriam Kiper as the motherMacDougall as the son of an inn keeperor MrBrowne as the fatherYou do not find time to bother about that part of your reactionYour subjection to play and players is too strong and tenseIt is the usual thing to bother after the playquestioning members who played this rolewho played that roleAnd thenafter hours or days of weighing and shallow balancingwrite areview Again I questionWhy do people react so stupidly to the plays at this theatreThis is not the adequate or honest way to view a play like Brooke s or acting like the Little Theatre company sIn this play even as in The Trojan Women they have closely approached that losing themselves in theimpersonal idealorone traditionof which MrPowys spoke so white heatedly in a former article in THE LITTLE REVIEWExcept for MacDougall and for Mosemanwho

at the stakebound to a great tree in iron chainsThe flames lapped at his feetglowing into his old face that was scarred and leathered with battlebrightening the silver of his fierce mustache Out of the reddened shadows that fell over him like a mantle his lips could be seen curling in a smilecontemptuous and arrogantand he turned his eyes toward the Dnyeper where the boats of his brothers were pulling away under a rain of lead Farewellcomrades he shouted to them remember meand come hither again next spring to make merryAnd then he turned to the Lyakhs against whom he had waged war and who knew him as the raven of the steppeThe fire had risen above the faggots and the great tree was burningOut of the flames came the voice of the heroA Tzar shall arise from the Russian soil and there

Review Gorky at His Best and Worst Chelkashand Other Storiesby Maxim GorkyNew YorkAKnopf Maxim Gorky is the poorest and most uneven of the Russian writersHe is or was a pioneerHe came wailing from lonely roads where the vagrom man sleeps beneath the stars and wonders what there is to lifeAnd his dullbitter plaints with ferocity as their leit motif soon sounded over the worldWhen the majority of Russian genius was struggling togo to the peopleGorki had the advantage of coming from the peopleAlfred Knopf s collection of Gorki tales under the title of Chelkash is Gorky at his best and worstI find in it some of his best tales abominably writtenstudded with crassgemsof philosophybroken up with unnecessary moralizingsFor instancehis Twenty Six of Us and One OtherIn this Gorky writes of his immortal bakeshopAs a youth Gorky spent his days in a bakeshopTime and again he has painted itin other stories better than in this oneBut in this instance the bakeshop is only a backgroundusually it is the main themeTanyaa little girlstops every morning to sayHelloto the twenty six bakersThey give her little cakesShe is the onlyray of sweetnessin their livesThey look upon her as a daughtera shrineAnd Tanya it is who alone awakens in them for a few moments each day something approaching finenessAlong comes a terrible dandya ladiesmanHe seduces every lady he sets his cap forit is his boastThe bakers like himhe is agentlemanand very democraticBut one day when he is boasting the head baker grows excited and mentionsTanya The dandy boasts he will seduce herA n argument followsAfter a month the dandy succeedsThe bakers witness the girl sundoing When she comes out of the dandy s roomsmilinghappythey gather around herspit at herrevile and abuse herNo names they can think of are bad enoughThey fall into a frenzy of vituperationBut they do not strike herRealizing dully that agodhas diedthey go back to workChelkashthe first tale in the bookis Gorky on hishome ground the vagrom manthe piratethe road thiefHe paints him with a careful brush and a sureness of his subjectIn The Steppe he does the sameA Rolling Stoneand Chumsthe last the best story in the volumeare also variations of the vagrom man theme the underdogBut it is in stories like One Autumn NightComradesThe Green Kittenand Her Lover that Gorky reveals his greatest genius and his greatest weaknessHe can feel themimagine themsee thembut for some reason he cannot write themOne Autumn Night might have been one of the world s strongest classicsAl l the tales in the volume are the work of thefirstGorky the bitter onethe melodramaticoutraged GorkyThey are on a whole not as good as the collection of stories written during that same period and translated in a volume called Orloff and His WifeGorky still lives and he has learned how to writeHis later talescomposed in Italy by thesecondGorkythe consumptivecontemplativeclear seeing Gorkyare maturealmost mellowBut they are no longer distinctiveAnyone could have written themanyone with a bit of genius and a great deal of time on his handsBut the Chelkash tales and the tales in Orloff and His Wife these no one but Gorky has writtenand although they are inferior in workmanship to the products of Chekhov and Andreyev the American reader will find them perhaps more interestingTwo Masters and a Petty Monster The Little Angelby Leonid AndreyevNew YorkAlfred AKnopfRussian Silhouettesby Anton ChekhovNew YorkCharles Scribner s SonsThe Breaking Pointby Michael ArtsibashefNew YorkBWHuebsch Charming fellowsthose Russians said my friend When it comes to delineating the processesmental and physicalof rapesuicideincestarsonbutcheryand diseasethey are without peers I therefore take this occasion to hurl two newly translated Russian books at my friendhoping they land on his thick headThe first book which I hurl at my friend is Andreyev s The Little AngelIt is a collection of short storiesThere are fifteen stories in the new volume brought out by MrAlfred Knopfand all of them are little masterpiecesThere is one story about a dogSnapperOnly Anatole France has equaled itThere is another storyThe MarseillaiseIt is a perfect storyIt is Kipling at his very best plus a flavora notea something serious and deep that the Russians alone know how to commandthat Kipling never reachedThere is one storyIn the BasementI hope my friend chokes on this storyIt would serve him rightBut The Little Angel stands out from the fifteenIt is about a little boya bitterlonely hearted fellow whose mother drinks and beats himwhose father is dying of consumptionand who in turn snarls and bullies his playmates and weeps at night because his heart is so empty and heavyIn this story Andreyev attains a poignant delicacy of touch and a grim beauty which even his one time contemporary Chekhov never surpassedThe Little Angel is the most beautiful short story I ever have readChekhov has also been translated againA collection of fragmentsvibrating episodesmoodsand exquisite children stories called Russian Silhouettes has been issued by Scribners A better artist than Andreyevkeenermore reservedmore subtleChekhov to my notion nevertheless lacks the vibrancy which the author of The Seven Who Were Hanged flings into his talesAndreyev wields the pen of Dostoevsky with a little thinner inkChekhov is Turgenev fragmentizedHe has left behind him a series of little canvases so finely doneso skilfully passionate wellI hurl him at my friend without further ado It is that consumptive rogue of an Artzibashef who has caused most of the troubleThe devil take him and his erotic suicidesHis latest translated book brought out by Huebsch is a tasteless jokeIt is called The Breaking PointIn it all the characters but one commit suicideall the women areruined Whenever two or more of its genial personae come together they forthwith fall into an argument concerning the futility of lifethe idiocy of existence and so on and so onAnd the trouble is that Artzibashef can writebeautifullykeenlyand sometimes gloriouslyIn Saninefor instancein The Millionairethere are passages better than Andreyevbetter than Checkhovbetter than any writer has writtenBut the books are distortedfull of puerile moralizingsbreathing a diseased lust and a sentimentalized violence and The Breaking Point is the worst of them to dateArtzibashef s work stands in the same relation to the Russian realism that Paul De Kock s work stands to the French sensual finesse AT THE FINE ARTS THEATRE 410 SOUTH MICHIGAN
