LIGHT OF MY LAND  ROSE and amber was the sunset on the river Red rose the hills about Bingariz High upon their brows the black tree branches Spread wide across the turquoise sky I saw the parrots fly  A cloud of rising green from the long green grasses A mist of gold and green winging fast Into the gray shadow silence of the tamarisks Pearl white and wild was the flood below the ford I ran down the long hot road to thy door Thy door shone a white flower in the dusk lingering to  close   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The stars rose and stood above thy casement I cast my cloak and climbed to thee To thee Makhir Subatu  Naked she stood and glistening like the stars over her Her hair trailed about her like clouds about the moon Naked as the soul seeking love As the soul that waits for death White with benediction pendulous unfolding from the dark As the crystal sky of morning she waited And leaned her light above the earth of my desire Like a world that spins from the hand of Infinity Up from the night I leaped To thee Makhir Subatu  Pearl bright and wild a flood without a ford The River of Love flowed on Her eyes were gleaming sails in a storm Dipping swooning beckoning The dawn came and templed over her Gray arched and wide the sanctuary of light descended It was the altar where I lay And I lifted my face at last praying I saw the first glow fall about her Like marble pillars coming forth from the shadow I raised my hands thanking the gods   The Syrian Lover in Exile  That in love I had grown so tall I could touch the two lamps in heaven The sun and moon hanging in the low heaven beneath her  face How great through love had I grown To breathe my flame into the two lamps of heaven  O eyes of the eagle and the dove Eyes red starred and white starred Eyes that have too much seen too much confessed Close close beneath my kisses Tell me no more demand me no more it is day I see the gold green rain of parrot wings Sparkling athwart the gray and rose gold morning I go from thy closed door down the long lone road To the ricefields beyond the river Beyond the river that has a ford  I came to thee with hope with desire I have them no longer Sleep sleep I am locked in thee  Thus the exile lover remembers thee Makhir Subatu   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ALMA MATER  The Immigrant at Columbia  Gajor richest of the Syrians is my friend He sends me to the vast school Where the great square winged houses circle And call the young men in Come Come beyond our pillars and our fountains Come from the restless spending city Passionate and cold Her blistered mouth would drink you dry Ere your eager hopes had found a soil and a sun To draw them to a high bursting fragrance and a white  white bloom Roofing the world Come behind my gray brown walls Even strong sober walls without towers Like a warm still wine in the cup of youth Lift up your young blood here To the lips of learning  O Alma Mater From the red red dust the long dead dust Of ancient Syria I come To lie between thy feet of lasting bronze And look up and look up To see thy laureled head   Alma Mater  Massive calm with gloried brow Flame before the open portals of the House of Books Where the thoughts of noble men Dressed in all habits speaking all tongues Gathered from all ages of time Meet like pilgrims at one shrine For the worship of service to thy sons O mother thy brow shines loftily Above the endless sullen roar of heavy whips In the unmastered market of slaves What light is on thy face brighter than the dawn It is the wide flung beauty of her Torch the Other Woman Who stands upon the sea as thou upon the land And lifts her light Beckoning the sons of weeping centuries Out of their long dead dust across the ten great seas Into this harbor  Ay into this harbor have I come Where white sails of the world like strings of a pearled lute Chant Liberty and Liberty and Liberty In the crashing wind of her lifted arm Oh chords from the smitten silver of light Mother thy breast is bared and beating high to catch that  song   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  AFTER VESPERS  The singers are all hushed and gone From the chapel Dreaming I linger here alone Ever unsatisfied yearning Softly the gray Silence enters and sits beside me Her palms are flushed From the brow of the passionate city She laid them there for a cool blessing of peace Now their touch quivers me She is shod with unworded prayers Violets from the spring twilight are her eyes Deep with desire  Ajan Syrian   TO RUPERT BROOKE  Died before the Dardanelles April 1915  I  You too superb on unreturning tides Pass and the brightness dies out of the air Our life itself seems dreamlike waiting where The desert of no paths forever hides Your hates and longings your revolts and prides The secret miracle that your songs declare As these few reliques to our eager care And long delight your stricken hand confides  Beautiful lover of beauty child of the sea Sunlight and mysteries of the evening foam Though sleep shall heal the feet too far a roam Are you at peace now as you longed to be Or beauty hungered does your soul go free Out of the harbor of its mortal home  II  It was enough that common men had died In this vast horror of the shaken world Where life s primeval hate broadcast is hurled To crush the age s generous youth and pride   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  In flame and anguish proving how we lied Who dreamed a nobler banner now unfurled Over mankind while bitter smoke wreaths curled Up from the Moloch lips we had denied  But you not as this age s sacrifice Should have gone down you were foredoomed to be Not of the age but of all time a light This hour has grief too much but you are price That the race pays for its apostasy Its hour of madness in the abysmal night  III  Song lingered at your lips delicate song Whose flowing waters in the golden day Bore from the hill lands of the far away The dews of rarer heights for which men long But when the tawdry baseness of the throng Opposed to that fair stream its dull delay Your words leaped skyward into stinging spray A scornful challenge to the powers of wrong  When you sang of beauty Beauty s self came down Blue robed and shining to the courts you laid Where the heart walks at evening hushed and free But when you touched the dullard and the clown   To Rupert Brooke  The jangled keys of your tense spirit made Discords that were your prayer to harmony  IV  Clear level light across the English hills Where garden shadows track the afternoon Dusk under willows where a summer moon Its long cascades of ghostly silver spills Down pools of silence a refrain that fills The heart with sense of some forgotten tune The trembling white limbs of youth s night of June When life s whole perfume up the wind distils  These drift out of the regions that enfold you And from my memory almost smooth away The picture of your known and mortal face As though the lineaments could no longer hold you Their prisoner nor the earthen lamp betray With dust the flame that there had dwelling place  V  The song is ended but the years have set No boundary to your memory you have done A young man s miracles your dreams have won Some little of fadeless wonder from the fret   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And torture of the days your eyes have met The eyes of the Archangel of the Sun And your lips cried in brief last orison A gleam and glory men will not forget  The rest is silence your smile of swift delight Shall flash to ours no more nor shall the hand Bring the heart s greeting as you come again Only an echo from the silent land Only a gleam sometimes through summer rain A width a shining peace under the night  Arthur Davison Ficke   LORD OF MORNING  Lord of morning light of day Sacred color kindling Sun We salute thee in the way Roadside pilgrims robed in dun  For thou art a pilgrim too Overlord of all our band In thy fervor we renew Quests we do not understand  At thy summons we arise At thy touch put glory on And with glad unanxious eyes Move into the march of dawn  NOON  Behold now where the pageant of high June Halts in the glowing noon The trailing shadows rest on plain and hill The bannered hosts are still While over forest crown and mountain head The azure tent is spread   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The song is hushed in every woodland throat Moveless the lilies float Even the ancient ever murmuring sea Sighs only fitfully The cattle drowse in the field corner s shade Peace on the world is laid  It is the hour when Nature s caravan That bears the pilgrim Man To the far region of his hope sublime Across the desert of time Rests in the green oasis of the year Its journey s end drawn near  Ah traveler hast thou nought of thanks or praise For these fleet halcyon days No courage to uplift thee from despair Born with the breath of prayer Then turn thee to the lilied field once more God stands in his tent door  Bliss Carman   LA RUE DE LA MONTAGNE SAINTEGENEVIEVE  I have seen an old street weeping Narrow dark ascending Water o er the spires Of a church descending The church thrice veiled in rain In the shadow of the years In the grace of old design Dim dwellings blind with tears Rotting either side The winding passage way To where the river crosses Weeping under gray And limpid heavens weeping Gardens I have seen Through arched doors whose gratings  Ever cry the keen Dim melodies of lace Long used and rare gardens With an old time grace Vibrating dimly trembling In the music of the rain Roses I have seen drip a faint Perfume and lilacs train A quivering loveliness   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  From door to arched door Passing by in flower carts While waters ever pour O er the white stones of the fountain Melting icily away Half way up the mountain Where to mingle tears with tears Their clothes misshapen sobbing Two or three old women In wooden sabots hobbling Meet to fill their pitchers From the stream of water leaping Through the lips a long time parted Of a face grotesquely weeping A carven face forever weeping  Dorothy Dudley   SONNETS  THE WALK ON THE MOOR  Tonight is many sorrowed said the moon She and the clouds were whirled above the moor Small as a glow worm shone my cottage door Cometh the morning late or over soon The night is sorrow s measure ran her rune Do ye not hear forgotten littlenesses Mother whose kiss lies warm on children s tresses Hear then the soundless rush of elfin shoon  Feet that are but the wind across the grass How long ago they passed to women s wailing Women whose ancient sorrow leaves you this Ye that have borne that not a breeze shall pass Across your hair but tis small fingers trailing And tears shall sting you at your children s kiss  MORNING ON THE BEACH  Some brighter thing than sunlight touched the sea And out of dawn arose a wind of joy They woke and chirped my girl and then my boy Like birds that have not learned what fears there be   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And now I thought there dawns a day to me One day at least defies moon prophecies One day shall call the old world sorrows lies So let us now be happy utterly  Then we had playmates in the grains of sand I heard them many laughing by the water The sweet air thrilled to speech without a tongue They met my boy and led him by the hand To venturous depths they showed my little daughter How children built on sand when time was young  Georgia Wood Pangborn   WOODWINDS  HADLEYBURG  Hadleyburg was the most honest and upright town in all the region round about Mark Twain John Barleycorn he said the town Was half a knave and half a clown Nor saner than the law allowed With all its stiff restraints and prim Observances the place he vowed Had too much starch in it for him And kept itself upon the jump To whip the devil round the stump  That crooked souls and crooked knees Distinguished men from walking trees Was sagely then and there agreed But bent on laughing them to scorn Mad John denying them a creed Resolved to stray amid the corn And eavesdropping from stalk to stalk To hear some goblin money talk  And peeping from behind a bee He fell into a reverie Beholding them so smugly housed And pondered what would happen had Some sudden thunder been aroused   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Thinking of which the silly lad Collapsed beside a brawling brook And laughed until the welkin shook  LITTLE SONGS OF TH E FOREST  Spring Song  Softly at dawn a whisper stole Down from the Green House on the Hill Enchanting many a ghostly bole And wood song with the ancient thrill  Gossiping on the countryside Spring and the wandering breezes say God has thrown heaven open wide And let the thrushes out today  Serenade  The Moon puts on her silver veil And shawl of lace and with far lutes And violins in many a dale The thrushes blow their woodland flutes  Oh and with many a ghostly cheer Under the moon the forest heaves And sways with ecstasy to hear The eerie laughter of the leaves   Little Songs of the Forest  Canticle  Devoutly worshiping the oak Wherein the barred owl stares The little feathered forest folk Are praying sleepy prayers  Praying the summer to be long And drowsy to the end And daily full of sun and song That broken hopes may mend  Praying the golden age to stay  Until the whippoorwill  Appoints a windy moving day  And hurries from the hill  Autumn Song  Once more the crimson rumor Fills the forest and the town And the green fires of summer Are burning burning down  Oh the green fires of summer Are burning down once more  And my heart is in the ashes On the forest floor   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Interlude  Since yesterday has been no word Nor voice of anything To thrill the forest and no bird Has any heart to sing  Since yesterday has been no track Of Pan nor any power To lure the gypsy summer back And fool a single flower  Requiescat  Gray are the sentry leaves and thinned  That whisper at my cabin door  Sighing and mourning as the wind  Worries and walks the forest floor  O leaves O leaves that find no voice  In the white silence of the snows  To bid the crimson woods rejoice  Or wake the wonder of the rose  William Griffith    SONGS OF HUNGER  THE CROWN THE PLATE AND THE BOWL  You ll crown my head with a silver crown You ll bring me food on a golden plate You ll offer me drink from a carven cup  If only I bow me down  But the crown was wrought by a wanton trull The gold was wrung from an harlot s hire The wine is blood and the bowl you bring  Was carved from an human skull  THE TEMPLE OF HUNGER  There s a temple dark and silent Littered with dust and bone Where the countless hoards of the starving Bow at the Lean God s throne  In the chilling gloom by the altar Whence even hatred has fled Sits the God of Hunger gloating Over tribute of starven dead   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Before him and beaten and bitter From eastern and western lands Cringe the people the God of Hunger Will crumple between his hands  Silent they crouch and hopeless Each with a loot that sees Each one but a stricken shadow Its forehead between its knees  A RIDDLE  Bitter as tears That for years  Are unshed Ashen and gray As a day  That is dead Evil and ill With a chill  O the vault Barren as beaches God leaches  With salt Hopeless as morrows In sorrows  Immersed   A Riddle  Desolate grim Like a hymn  Of the cursed Lone as a cry From the sky  Or the sea Answer my saying In praying  For me  TH E LEAN GRAY RATS  The lean gray rats of hunger Have gnawed my soul in twain  Till cursing the God that made it The good half died in pain  The ill half lived and prospered Waxed brutal and strong and fat But the good half died and was eaten In hell by a lean gray rat Skipwith Cannell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse THE LOVE SONG OF J ALFRED PRUFROCK  S io credessi che mia risposta fosse A persona che mai tornasse al mondo Questa fiamma staria senza piû scosse Ma perciocchè giammai di questo fondo Non torno vivo alcum s i odo il vero Senza tema d infamia ti rispondo  Let us go then you and I When the evening is spread out against the sky Like a patient etherized upon a table Let us go through certain half deserted streets The muttering retreats Of restless nights in one night cheap hotels And sawdust restaurants with oyster shells Streets that follow like a tedious argument Of insidious intent To lead you to an overwhelming question   Oh do not ask What is it Let us go and make our visit  In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo  The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window panes The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window panes Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains   The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock  Let fall upon its back the spot that falls from chimneys Slipped by the terrace made a sudden leap And seeing that it was a soft October night Curled once about the house and fell asleep  And indeed there will be time For the yellow smoke that slides along the street Rubbing its back upon the window panes There will be time there will be time To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet There will be time to murder and create And time for all the works and days of hands That lift and drop a question on your plate Time for you and time for me And time yet for a hundred indecisions And for a hundred visions and revisions Before the taking of a toast and tea  In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo  And indeed there will be time To wonder Do I dare and Do I dare Time to turn back and descend the stair With a bald spot in the middle of my hair They will say How his hair is growing thin My morning coat my collar mounting firmly to the chin   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  My necktie rich and modest but asserted by a simple pin They will say But how his arms and legs are thin Do I dare Disturb the universe In a minute there is time For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse  For I have known them already known them all Have known the evenings mornings afternoons I have measured out my life with coffee spoons I know the voices dying with a dying fall Beneath the music from a farther room  So how should I presume  And I have known the eyes already known them all The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase And when I am formulated sprawling on a pin When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall Then how should I begin To spit out all the butt ends of my days and ways  And how should I presume  And I have known the arms already known them all Arms that are braceleted and white and bare But in the lamplight downed with light brown hair  Is it perfume from a dress That makes me so digress   The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock  Arms that lie along a table or wrap about a shawl And should I then presume And how should I begin  Shall I say I have gone at dusk through narrow streets And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes Of lonely men in shirtsleeves leaning out of windows  I should have been a pair of ragged claws Scuttling across the floors of silent seas  And the afternoon the evening sleeps so peacefully Smoothed by long fingers Asleep tired or it malingers Stretched on the floor here beside you and me Should I after tea and cakes and ices Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis But though I have wept and fasted wept and prayed Though I have seen my head grown slightly bald brought  in upon a platter I am no prophet and here s no great matter I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat and  snicker And in short I was afraid  And would it have been worth it after all After the cups the marmalade the tea   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Among the porcelain among some talk of you and me Would it have been worth while To have bitten off the matter with a smile To have squeezed the universe into a ball To roll it toward some overwhelming question To say I am Lazarus come from the dead Come back to tell you all I shall tell you all If one settling a pillow by her head  Should say That is not what I meant at all That is not it at all  And would it have been worth it after all Would it have been worth while After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets After the novels after the teacups after the skirts that trail  along the floor And this and so much more It is impossible to say just what I mean But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a  screen Would it have been worth while If one settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl And turning toward the window should say That is not  it at all That is not what I meant at all  No I am not Prince Hamlet nor was meant to be Am an attendant lord one that will do   The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock  To swell a progress start a scene or two Advise the prince withal an easy tool Deferential glad to be of use Politic cautious and meticulous Full of high sentence but a bit obtuse At times indeed almost ridiculous Almost at times the Fool  I grow old I grow old I shall wear the bottoms of my trowsers rolled  Shall I part my hair behind Do I dare to eat a peach I shall wear white flannel trowsers and walk upon the beach I have heard the mermaids singing each to each I do not think that they will sing to me  I have seen them riding seaward on the waves Combing the white hair of the waves blown back When the wind blows the water white and black  We have lingered in the chambers of the sea By seagirls wreathed with seaweed red and brown Till human voices wake us and we drown  T S Eliot  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COMMENTS AND REVIEWS  THE DEATH OF RUPERT BROOKE  T is fitting to pause a moment over this symbol  of the waste of war The young poet who died  of sunstroke on an English cruiser in the  Dardanelles was the finest flower of the race  He was not only a poet of high achievement and higher promise but a rare spirit not only a rare spirit modest noble minded but in Mr Yeats phrase the most beautiful young man in England One of the men fittest to survive and give his strength and beauty to the race is cut down in his proud youth by that ruthless gigantic harvester modern war One fallen soldier more one of millions fallen or doomed that mediaeval minded monarchs may try out their illusions with embattled armies  A year ago Rupert Brooke passed through this country on his way home from the south seas I remember my first sight of him For some foolish reason one hardly dares speak of a living man as beautiful but when death stiffens flesh to marble no casual smile can mock at the word or deny the thrill Here was lyric Apollo indeed as if freshly made at the dawn of time and sent to our modern world with a message from the old gods  However he was quite unaware of any special divinity indeed a somewhat wide acquaintance with poets has rarely shown me one who rated himself and his work so modestly In July he sent from England the poem Retrospect which   The Death of Rupert Brooke  POETRY printed last October and the final lines of which  now seem premonitory O haven without wave or tide Silence in which all songs have died Holy book where hearts are still And home at length under the hill O mother quiet breasts of peace Where love itself would faint and cease O infinite deep I never knew I would come back come back to you Find you as a pool unstirred Kneel down by you and never a word Lay my head and nothing said In your hands ungarlanded And a long watch you would keep And I should sleep and I should sleep Then came the war In October the poet who had  joined the second naval brigade wrote from the royal naval  barracks Chatham  I m afraid I shan t do anything more while the war lasts and we expect it to go on at least a year more probably two Afterward I hope to start again I ve been having a great time and a terrible one in a way We the Naval Brigade went to Antwerp for the last part of the siege I ll never forget the sight of hundreds of thousands of refugees white desperate stunned creatures There can never have been a nation so wronged and tortured in European memory   Shelter the refugee muses for a time Europe is no place for them Good luck to you The next letter brought the war sonnets printed in our  April number One perhaps two are goodish the poet  wrote I doubt if I have time to write any more before I  go out again  In printing the sonnets I felt some regret that they cele  brated the old illusions War to this young poet soldier   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  was glorified by the romantic glamour which as it has been made mostly by the arts must be stripped off by the arts if war is to become as archaic and absurd tomorrow as duelling is today So long as men think war beautiful nations will arm and fight and since from the dawn of time the arts have taught that war is beautiful so from this hour of the most deadly and unjustifiable of wars they must begin to teach the world the glory of heroic life the beauty of persistent and devoted service and the infinite generosity of modern science modern civilization in the multiform opportunities it offers for heroism  However all the pathetic beauty of the old ideal was incarnate in this young poet and ensainted by his death He is archetypal of the millions upon millions of proud young men who have gone singing to their death on the world s battlefields obscure pawns in mighty games played for ends they never questioned That he died of sunstroke is perhaps the more symbolic it allies him the more closely with those Homeric heroes whom some god wrapped in golden mist and bore from the bloody field And so on his fair young brow let us place the ancient laurel and bear him like a soldier to his tomb  Young beautiful he went singing to the wars But the bright sungod would not have it so While dreadnoughts hurled the iron bolts of Mars Apollo called how could he choose but go  H M   Hark to Sturge Moore  HARK TO STURGE MOORE  Mr Sturge Moore s last book a triologue between three nice men in tweed suits concerning the nature of style and the beautiful is so far as I am concerned a mere annoyance and I will therefore refrain from reviewing it Hark to These Three by T Sturge Moore Elkin Mathews Good poets are too few and the exacerbations of life are too many Let me rather remind the reader that Sturge Moore is the author of The Vinedresser and Other Poems of The Defeat of the Amazons and a dozen or so classical plays that will never be popular and that the best of his work is I think permanent for those who know the Mareotic juice from Coecuban  I am reader tired as you are also I doubt not of the New York school of reviewers who will be forever sizing up poems by gross tonnage discovering each week a new Shelley or a new Keats or a new Whistler I even remember one lady who said her husband was known as the American Whistler  Also I am dead tired of a criticism that is forever making  comparisons of magnitude and never definitions of quality  A pox upon all editors upon all uniforms and upon the  present publishing system A pox are we to have no more  individuals  I have been reasonably meticulous in these pages in  defining my idea of the classic in indicating my preference  for a straight running speech and I may therefore be par   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  doned for expressing an idle unharnessed and unprofessional  enjoyment  The essential thing in a poet is that he build us his world It may be Prospero s island it may be the tavern with Falstaff or the stripped world of Candide or Florence which has spread its futile reputation into the nether reaches of hell or it may be the burlesque of Hudibras but some such reality or some such phantasm the author must rear up  about us And after one has sunk one s personal differences or even made up one s mind that one s personal differences with Mr Sturge Moore are everlastingly unsettlable the fact of his magic remains In the Chorus of Dorides in a dozen other places it remains  Dead dead hale youth is dead  Broken bruised broken bathed in spray  See see the hair the wealth of his head  With spoilt wreath tendrils wed  Limp as a dress once gay  Which on the shore is found  Where bathing a child has drowned  So lies he white as the spray  So white Adonis lay  Before his whimpering hound  So white on mid sea lone  Rocked by the billows lay  Fallen Icarus Phaethon fallen  Through flaming forest prone  Deaf to the wail at dawn  To houseless nymph and fawn  Deaf where the leaves were ashes  All lifeless white and so  Lay Hyacinth his pillow  Tragic with purple splashes   Deaf to left handed Woe    Hark to Sturge Moore  Where breezes through the willow On beds of blue bells blow Were these not kissed not washed with tears Did any fond name at their ears Fail to plead vainly  Dead dead poor short lived lover Wasted wrecked wasted day by day Two careless tides will cover And roll thee in their spray When Peacemeal grow thy frail bones white Wilt thou through thy worn skull by night Hear shore wind sighing  Sturge Moore is more master of cadence than any of his English contemporaries If Mr Yeats has perfect mastery  in Red Hanrahan s Song About Ireland and in the verse of The Wind Among the Reeds even his most fervent admirers  must grant that Moore has the greater variety of cadences in his quiver and that he excels his friend in onomatopoeic aptness in varying and fitting the cadence to its subject emotion  Lacedaemon hast thou seen it Lacedaemon Lacedaemon From Taygetus the forests Slope from snows raised far above them Lacedaemon rich in corn lands With the grand hill shoulders round them Blue as lapis in the twilight  That is both a good and a bad example It is the Spanish redondilla cadence that we know in Rio verde rio verde  He has not escaped rhythmic monotony in these seven lines  but I have quoted the whole seven for the sake of the im  agistic vividness in the last one   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He will never be popular in America because of the small town or smart Alec sense of the superficially comic which pervades that continent Who with this ever present smartness could get beyond such an opening line as  We maidens are older than most sheep Yet that line opens a quite beautiful poem and on the whole they are the words most suited for conveying their portion of the effect of the whole Again the microscopical mind of any reviewer will not be expected to pass over cockney rhymes whereof there are several most flagrant in this book called The Vinedresser ought and sort in one place short and ought in another Such things are like the gritting of a slate pencil and are no more to be passed over lightly than are the obvious surface faults in Poe s Helen You forgive a poet his sins for the sake of his virtues because he hath loved much But it is a consummate slovenliness of general criticism to see no flaw in the idol merely because numen inest  It is because of the prevalence of slovenly praising in prefaces in histories of literature and by college professors that we get no fine age of verse Countless young poets hearing older authors spoken of always with adulation get drunk with their beauty copy their faults and the art in general suffers  Mr Sturge Moore s beautiful world is not unlike the world of H D hellenic vivid in color and this despite the fact that they write almost in different tongues in utterly different metric and that there is no influence one way or   Hark to Sturge Moore  the other seeing that Mr Moore is of an earlier generation The Vinedresser appeared in 1899 and that H D has to my almost certain knowledge never read a single line of Sturge Moore A least she had not when his poems first appeared So much for future philologists  As for an audience I am always at war with the motto on the cover of this magazine Let me consider Moore s audience Six years ago Mr Lawrence Binyon said to me Have you ever read Sturge Moore and I went back to the British Museum reading room and read the Defeat of the Amazons which I have never forgotten Though I can remember few phrases I have the scene and some memory of  the rhythm especially that speech of the running faun beginning Aie aie aie  Laomedon  Then there was Maurice Hewlett three years since contending that Moore was the best poet in England and besides that there is the constant admiration of two such different artists as Mr W B Yeats and Mr Wyndham Lewis And that is perhaps public enough for any man in his life time At least I should so suspect Mr Sturge Moore of considering it for I have never known a man less aware of the circumjacent vulgarity and of the general stew of the world the world of letters etc  WOODSTOCK MAZE  A crown in her lap all proud of her bower  A woman become a child from using power  Her beauty gave her bounteous gave and thence   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Renewed in petulence and lucky faults So fresh her whole life breathless halts To see a star fall through immense High arch d twilight Rosamund peaceful sat and sang While the woods lay still and their echoes rang To the song Love loves the night A captive to innocence held there to wait Pale where the paths all led whence none led straight Or could help flight until the queen came up And told her in a whisper she must die Hated beneath the quiet sky Slowly she drained the deep stained cup And still grew white Slowly there where she sat and sang While still the wooded echoes rang To the song Love loves the night It is our curse to know we are heard The charm of  first books the reason why poetry is of youth and prose of middle age is that despite their faults in execution the young are for the most part without an audience they write for their own ears they are not spoiled by knowing there will be an audience After a man has a public there is always the curse the venom as soon as he has written his verse and if the gods have no pity the very middle of his thought is interrupted with the thought that too many must hear it Only the gods darlings escape this And Sturge Moore has in this vein at least been greatly favored Odi et arceo was ever a boast more vain or an irritated outburst more filled with true aspiration than this opening of urbanest Horace plagued with all the devils of metropolitan sycophant praises and auditors Arceo The foxes and eagles had the better of him Is there any eyrie so remote any heart so   Reviews  hermetic that it is not reached by the persistent echoes of braying  Let us then close with a couple of platitudes Sturge Moore s work is more like to itself than to anybody else s and that is always an advantage If The Vinedresser is at times reminiscent it is reminiscent of Blake and of Browning who are respectively the soundest core of their eras  Row till the sea nymphs rise To ask you why Rowing you tarry not To hear them sigh  Ezra Pound  REVIEWS  Spoon River Anthology by Edgar Lee Masters Macmillan  The other day I was in a little Illinois town on the old canal and I was surprised to find how much imaginative life had been added to the place by Mr Masters Spoon River Anthology Deserted by the tide of progress that followed the building of the new canal there was an air of memory and regret about the place a provincial richness and a sense of desolation The square stone houses built of lime stone quarried from the hills and the old frame houses of the pioneer colonial pattern seemed to hold in hiding the secret lives of the people of whom Mr Masters had written This is the service that Mr Masters has performed for us he has given an intensely vital meaning to our immediate human environment He has done for us what the young Irish writers have done for Ireland   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Not long ago certain English poets were complaining that we had no poets except Whitman essentially American in spirit or reflecting American life But American literary tradition a tradition more indigenous than that of the colonial New England school is still in the making Men like Mr Robert Frost and Mr Masters and like Mr E A Robinson who may be said to have been the pioneer in this particular field are contributing to it It is a significant fact that Mr Frost has made the characters of a New England community and Mr Masters the characters of a little Illinois town live for us as no American novelist has done since Hawthorne They have created not types but human beings This is the secret of Mr Masters method In revealing the crisis of each individual life in Spoon River he reveals the soul of the community  Of course we have had writers and poets who were distinctly racial in a sense that would appeal to the Londoner Bret Harte Mark Twain Joaquin Miller or Lowell but were these men not steeped in that very romanticism the lack of which Mr Floyd Dell laments in Mr Masters And isn t it just this romanticism that has kept the American from expressing the heights or depths of experience I can not help but feel relieved by the general sense of tragedy that pervades Mr Masters book There is nothing unhealthy or morbid or hopeless about it as there often is about that of European writers It is simply the sense of the tragedy of broken and wasted lives of unnecessarily wasted lives For in spite of death and defeat Mr Masters makes   Reviews  life seem precious Humorous squalid and noble at the same time an affair of broken wings splendid hopes draggled aspirations and smothered beauty life is yet too amazingly vital to be discarded even by those who have themselves taken the final step to discard it These people who are dead love life and remember it with regret Not all of these people indeed as one shrewdly suspects have yet gained the secure repose of the hill at Spoon River In many cases the tragedy is individual the defeat of ambition through personal short sightedness or limitation But often through the individual histories of these men and women touched with humor sarcasm beauty pity and terror Mr Masters touches also upon larger issues and a stronger note is struck in the hint of final fulfilment of causes for which the individual perished Back of the sense of tragedy is a flaming idealism  not entirely masked by the cover of sarcastic irony  I don t know why it is that American people are so averse to satire The Spoon River Anthology reflects American life not in a superficial but in a deeper sense It is deeply rooted in the soil and a part of its power to move us is in the associations of the past generation that it calls up But an ample vision of the future beyond the scope of this generation is also presented We find Mr Masters own faith and doubt for the future variously recorded in several of the poems Both are suggested in this composite picture formed in the brain of Rutherford McDowell the village photographer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  They brought me ambrotypes Of the old pioneers to enlarge And sometimes one sat for me Someone who was in being When giant hands from the womb of the world Tore the republic What was it in their eyes For I could never fathom That mystical pathos of drooped eyelids And the serene sorrow of their eyes It was like a pool of water Amid oak trees at the edge of a forest Where the leaves fall As you hear the crow of a cock From a far off farm house seen near the hills Where the third generation lives and the strong men And the strong women are gone and forgotten And these grand children and great grand children Of the pioneers Truly did my camera record their faces too With so much of the old strength gone And the old faith gone And the old mastery of life gone And the old courage gone Which labors and loves and suffers and sings Under the sun  And here is the epitaph of Lincoln s law partner William  H Herndon to place beside Mr E A Robinson s fine por  trait The Master There by the window in the old house Perched on the bluff overlooking miles of valley My days of labor closed sitting out life s decline Day by day did I look in my memory As one who gazes in an enchantress crystal globe And I saw the figures of the past As if in pageant glassed by a shining dream Move through the incredible sphere of time And I saw a man arise from the soil like a fabled giant   Reviews  And throw himself over a deathless destiny Master of great armies head of the republic Bringing together into a dithyramb of recreative song The epic hopes of a people At the same time Vulcan of sovereign fires Where imperishable shields and swords were beaten out From spirits tempered in heaven Look in the crystal See how he hastens on To the place where his path comes up to the path Of a child of Plutarch and Shakespeare O Lincoln actor indeed playing well your part And Booth who strode in a mimic play within the play Often and often I saw you As the cawing crows winged their way to the wood Over my house top at solemn sunsets There by my window Alone  The first appreciation of the Spoon River Anthology then running in the St Louis Mirror appeared in the October 1914 number of POETRY Mr Ezra Pound in The Egoist and Mrs Eunice Tietjens in The Chicago Evening Post were quick to second our praise but we are now told by our credulous newspapers that Mr Powys discovered this aboriginal genius the author of Spoon River It is pleasant to have one s own opinion ratified and yet to realize that the initial recognition of an American author was not in this case left to an English critic A C H   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Some Imagist Poets an Anthology Houghton Mifflin Co  Although POETRY is ignored in the preface to this volume our readers will recognize the finest entries of its six poets covering thirty of the book s seventy seven printed pages as having appeared in this magazine many of them during our first year when no other publisher would look at them It is pleasing to see so honorable a house as the great Boston firm falling into line behind us but we should appreciate the compliment more deeply if our primacy were more definitely acknowledged  Nor do readers of POETRY need that information of the imagistic creed and technique which is now in scarcely recognizable form going the rounds of a bewildered press Over two years ago Messrs Pound and Flint defined for us the direct treatment the stript and exact word the sequence of the musical phrase the clear image as opposed to abstractions and offered A Few Don ts by an Imagist in an effort to bring back poetic technique to that best tradition exemplified in Sappho Catullus Villon  This new anthology represents a smaller group of poets than Des Imagistes of last year which also quoted lavishly from POETRY indeed its title shows that it does not pretend to include all the imagists Of the poets so classed in the earlier pamphlet we miss Messrs Pound Cannell Williams and Cournos American and Messrs Hueffer Upward and Joyce British And Mr D H Lawrence is a new entry The term Imagism becomes somewhat blurred in the   Reviews  present collection it loses something of that hard clear outline dear to the true imagist  But all this is preliminary Having cleared the ground let us consider the book for what is in it not for what is out of it The most authentic and indubitable note of passion passion fused and fixed in a form of sternly sculpturesque art like a bas relief by Bourdelle is in A Woman and her Dead Husband by Mr Lawrence And if this great poem expresses tragic love not less beautifully does Fireflies in the Corn express a dancing passion of delight in fireflies cornstalks and other ecstasies of nature and of fantastic mockery as the woman contrasts these with her lover s dullness Both these poems which must not be broken by quotation  they were in POETRY for January 1914 both these poems rhyme and in other respects they may not be quite in accord with imagistic practice but this is of little consequence except to lovers of labels They are some of the finest poetry written in this century and they are of a new kind in that they could not have been written in any other century Mr Lawrence gives us his own fire and cares not whether it respects rules or melts them And this fire is in every one of his seven poems even that brief little image  Green  I do not mean that Mr Lawrence is the only impassioned poet represented in this volume or that tragic love is the only emotion which can stir an artist to the depths Is there not passion in Corot s landscapes wreathed with dancing nymphs like embodied raptures of nature Are not Blake   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  lock s autumnal sunsets filled with flaming passion too deep for tears In the same way there is passionate sympathy with nature in Mr Fletcher s Blue Symphony in Mr Aldington s The Poplar in H D s Oread and The Garden These poems are not parlor fire works as the mercurial Mr Floyd Dell suggests in The New Republic but vividly imaginative landscapes painted with rich lights and shadows and fused with profound feeling  Indeed these are mostly painter poets Painters of the human figure indoors or out are suggested by such poems as Miss Lowell s beautiful Venus Transiens or Mr Flint s poignantly intimate Accident The Venus makes me think not of Botticelli whom it mentions but of a modern painter of sun lit sea foamy nudes Mr Childe Hassam Both artists give us the sparkling iridescence of nature s joy And Mr Flint paints the girl in the railway carriage with dark strokes sharply lit like Mr Jerome Myers  In some of the poems the imagistic ecstasy is strained by self consciousness or blurred by prosiness Mr Aldington s Childhood is touching and true but there is little reason either of rhythm or imagery for not printing it as prose So also Miss Lowell s polyphonic prose in The Bombardment remains for me scientific and artificial an interesting experiment rather than a new poetic form And while Mr Fletcher s Blue Symphony is Corot in one of his most lyric moods London Excursion gives the effect of an effort to do too much a picture unachieved   Reviews  Perhaps the very essence of imagism is presented in the poems of H D She is less disturbed than her companions by merely human feeling she stands in god like aloofness for the austerities of art and one or two of her vivid little drawings rank almost with certain brief and beautiful images achieved by Mr Pound in his most magical moments or by Mr Allen Upward in his Scented Leaves from a Chinese Jar Such things are the butterfly s wing fugitive delicate shot with color visible a mere instant against the blue  H M  Antwerp by Ford Madox Hueffer The Poetry Bookshop London Poems by John Rodker Printed by the Author 1 Osborn Street Whitechapel Sing Songs of the War by Maurice Hewlett The Poetry  Bookshop  When the inteligencia of London are hit with a new fashion in art they are hit hard They live with it they think it dress it eat it one may almost imagine the Nude Descending the Stair in ice cream Pre Raphaelitism spread its bane over walls cupboards chairs and invented the seamless dresses worn by lank women Now it is post impressionism vorticism or whatever may be the latest coinage of terms for the new movement  Mr Rodker s book has a tasteful spray of ganglia on the cover designed by Mr David Bombey and Mr Hueffer s   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  poem an arrangement of forked diagonals and a soldier represented by the sharp onward thrust of lines Yet what a relief these are after the perpetual pretty girl covers of our books and magazines Unfortunately it is not possible to reproduce the very appropriate head piece for the middle  section of Mr Hueffer s poem a poem of great beauty which I wish it were possible to quote in full I think I have had more lasting enjoyment from this poem than from any that I have seen on the war  III  For the white limbed heroes of Hellas ride by upon their  horses Forever through our brains The heroes of Cressy ride by upon their stallions And battalions and battalions and battalions The Old Guard the Young Guard the men of Minden and of  Waterloo  Pass forever staunch  Stand forever true  And the small man with the large paunch  And the gray coat and the large hat and the hands behind  the back Watches them pass In our minds forever But that clutter of sodden corses On the sodden Belgian grass That is a strange new beauty  IV  With no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty Assuredly that is the way of it The way of beauty And that is the highest word you can find to say of it For you cannot praise it with words Compounded of lyres and swords But the thought of the gloom and the rain   Reviews  And the ugly coated figure standing beside a drain Shall eat itself into your brain And you will say of all heroes They fought like the Belgians And you will say He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of  gloom And you will say He bought like a Belgian His doom And that shall be an honorable name Belgian shall be an honorable word As honorable as the fame of the sword As honorable as the mention of the many chorded lyre And his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in  Tyre  Much of Mr Rodker s verse I am frankly quite unable to fathom It is futuristic I use the word to describe a certain mingling of the subjective and objective to which one must submit oneself to get the value of the poems In other words the reader must attempt to place himself in the same subjective attitude and indulge in the same white heat of concentration upon which the ephemera of the objective world will burst with an importance quite disproportionate to the normal sense A painter would detect here many variations of the after image not necessarily visual however It is the instability of Mr Rodker s image that I find confusing But one reader may find the path easy where another stumbles The Mercury Vapor Lamps gives an impression in verse that might well be conveyed in music by one of the new composers London Night included in the volume was  published in the December number of POETRY My own reaction to Mr Rodker s verse might be said to be expressed in his Item   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  You said  your heart was  pieces of  strings  in a  peacock blue satin  bag  Mr Hewlett s booklet includes a group of songs very much in the nature of broad sheet ballads for they give the familiar homely touch of pathos and humor characteristic of such popular

thickens in the breach And as self fails I understand Your upward reach  The work goes on the dream goes on We are the tide waves nothing more Our separate lives beat and are gone Upon the shore  The

April mistakes my meaning because like many other people he goes off before he has applied   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  himself diligently to understand what he reads It is his function as he says in one place to stand bewildered or as he says in another to smear but he mistakes when he uses metre and mistakes even more gravely when he accuses me of optimism the vulgarest of American vices saying that I expect the world to go right when I say Gee That is an error I am boring my little hole in the adamantine stupidity of England America New Zealand and a few places elsewhere I even enjoy the job The effects are seen even in Mr L T W s vers libre for his words are in the normal order True his parodies are unimportant as parodies and I could in general advise him and the rest of the American parodists of my work to leave off until they have studied the very excellent parodies made by Mr Richard Aldington Mr Aldington is himself a poet he knows something about imagism he has taken the art seriously and made a study of various poets and periods whereas my American parodists have for the most part studied neither me nor anyone else  Tanti ringraziamenti Ezra Pound NOTES  Of the
