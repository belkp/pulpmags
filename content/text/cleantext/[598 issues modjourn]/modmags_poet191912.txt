temple of Hera pass before the curtain a dark purple hung between Ionic columns of the porch or open hall of a palace Their hair is bound as the marble hair of the temple Hera Each wears a crown or diadem of gold  They sing the music is temple music deep simple chanting notes  From the closed garden Where our feet pace Back and forth each day This gladiolus white This red this purple spray Gladiolus tall with dignity As yours lady we lay Before your feet and pray   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Of all the blessings Youth joy ecstasy May one gift last As the tall gladiolus may Outlast the wind flower Winter rose or rose One gift above Encompassing all those  For her for him For all within these palace walls Beyond the feast Beyond the cry of Hymen and the torch Beyond the night and music Echoing through the porch till day  The music with its deep chanting notes dies away The curtain hangs motionless in rich full folds Then from this background of darkness dignity and solemn repose a flute gradually detaches itself becomes clearer and clearer pipes alone one shrill simple little melody  From the distance four children s voices blend with the flute and four very little girls pass singly before the curtain small maids or attendants of the sixteen matrons Their hair is short and curls at the back of their heads like the hair of the chryselephantine Hermes They sing  Where the first crocus buds unfold W e found these petals near the cold Swift river bed   H D  Beneath the rocks where ivy frond Puts forth new leaves to gleam beyond Those lately dead  The very smallest two or three Of gold gold pale as ivory  W e gathered  When the little girls have passed before the curtain a wood wind weaves a richer note into the flute melody then the two blend into one song But as the wood wind grows in mellowness and richness the flute gradually dies away into a secondary theme and the wood wind alone evolves the melody of a new song  Two by two like two sets of medallions with twin profiles distinct one head slightly higher bent forward a little the four figures of four slight rather fragile taller children are outlined with sharp white contour against the curtain  The hair is smooth against the heads fallingders but slightly waved against the nape of theare looking down each at a spray of winter rose fall to the knees in sharp marble folds They to the neck The sing shoulThey tunics Never more will the wind Cherish youNever more again will the rain  Never more Shall we find you bright In the snow and wind   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The snow is melted The snow is gone And you are flown  Like a bird out of our hand Like a light out of our heart You are gone  As the wistful notes of the wood wind gradually die away there comes a sudden shrill swift piping  Free and wild like the wood maidens of Artemis is this last group of four very straight with heads tossed back They sing in rich free swift notes They move swiftly before the curtain in contrast to the slow important pace of the first two groups Their hair is loose and rayed out like that of the sun god They are boyish in shape and gesture They carry hyacinths in baskets strapped like quivers to their backs They reach to draw the flower sprays from the baskets as the Huntress her arrows  As they dart swiftly to and fro before the curtain the are youth they are spring they are the Chelidonia their song is the swallow song of joy  Between the hollows Of the little hills The spring spills blue Turquoise sapphire lapis lazuli On a brown cloth outspread   H D  Ah see How carefully we lay them now Each hyacinth spray Across the marble floor A pattern your bent eyes May trace and follow T o the shut bridal door  Lady our love our dear Our bride most fair They grew among the hollows Of the hills As if the sea had spilled its blue As if the sea had risen From its bed And sinking to the level of the shore Left hyacinths on the floor  There is a pause Flute pipe and wood wind blend in a full rich movement There is no definite melody but full powerful rhythm like soft but steady wind above forest trees Into this like rain gradually creeps the note of strings  As the strings grow stronger and finally dominate the whole the bride chorus passes before the curtain There may be any number in this chorus The figures tall young women clothed in long white tunics follow one another closely yet are all distinct like a procession of a temple frieze  The bride in the center is not at first distinguishable from her maidens but as they begin their song the maidens draw   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  apart into two groups leaving the veiled symbolic figure standing alone in the center  The two groups range themselves to right and left like officiating priestesses The veiled figure stands with her back against the curtain the others being in profile Her head is swathed in folds of diaphanous white through which the features are visible like the veiled Tanagra  When the song is finished the group to the bride s left turns about also the bride so that all face in one direction In processional form they pass out the figure of the bride again merging not distinguishable from the maidens  Strophe  But of her Who can say if she is fair Bound with fillet Bound with myrtle Underneath her flowing veil Only the soft length Beneath her dress Of saffron shoe is bright As a great lily heart In its white loveliness  Antistrophe  But of her We can say that she is fair W e bleached the fillet Brought the myrtle   H D  To us the task was set Of knotting the fine threads of silk We fastened the veil And over the white foot Drew on the painted shoe Steeped in Illyrian crocus  Strophe  But of her Who can say if she is fair For her head is covered over With her mantle White on white Snow on whiter amaranth Snow on hoar frost Snow on snow Snow on whitest buds of myrrh  Antistrophe  But of her We can say that she is fair For we know underneath All the wanness All the heat  In her blanched face Of desire  Is caught in her eyes as fire In the dark center leaf Of the white Syrian iris   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The rather hard hieratic precision of the music its stately pause and beat is broken now into irregular lilt and rhythm of strings  Four tall young women very young matrons enter in a group They stand clear and fair but this little group entirely lacks the austere precision of the procession of maidens just preceding them They pause in the center of the stage turn one three quarter two in profile and the fourth full face they stand turned as if confiding in each other like a Tanagra group  They sing lightly their flower trays under their arms  Along the yellow sand Above the rocks The laurel bushes stand Against the shimmering heat Each separate leaf Is bright and cold And through the bronze Of singing bark and wood Run the fine threads of gold  Here in our wicker trays W e bring the first faint blossoming Of fragrant bays  Lady their blushes shine As faint in hue As when through petals   H D  Of a laurel rose  The sun shines through  And throws a purple shadow  On a marble vase  Ah love  So her fair breasts will shine With the faint shadow above  The harp chords become again more regular in simple definite rhythm The music is not so intense as the bride  chorus and quieter more sedate than the notes preceding the entrance of the last group Five or six slightly older serene young women enter in  processional form each holding before her with precise bending of arms coverlets and linen carefully folded as if for the bride couch The garments are purple scarlet and deep blue with edge of gold  They sing to simple blending of wood wind and harp  From citron bower be her bed  Cut from branch of tree a flower Fashioned for her maidenhead  From Lydian apples sweet of hue Cut the width of board and lathe Carve the feet from myrtle wood  Let the palings of her bed  Be quince and box wood overlaid   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  With the scented bark of yew  That all the wood in blossoming May claim her heart and cool her blood For losing of her maidenhood  The wood winds become more rich and resonant A tall youth croses the stage as if seeking the bride door The music becomes very rich full of color  The figure itself is a flame an exaggerated symbol the hair a flame the wings deep red or purple stand out against the curtains in a contrasting or almost clashing shade of purple The tunic falls almost to the knees again a rich purple or crimson The knees are bare the sandals elaborately strapped over and over The curtain seems a rich purple cloud the figure still brighter like a flamboyant bird half emerged in the sunset  Love pauses just outside the bride s door with his gift a tuft of black purple cyclamen He sings to the accompaniment of wood winds in a rich resonant voice  The crimson cover of her bed Is not so rich nor so deeply bled The purple fish that dyed it red As when in a hot sheltered glen There flowered these stalks of cyclamen  Purple with honey points Of horns for petals   H D  Sweet and dark and crisp As fragrant as her maiden kiss  There with his honey seeking lips The bee clings close and warmly sips And seeks with honey thighs to sway And drink the very flower away  Ah stern the petals drawing back Ah rare ah virginal her breath  Crimson with honey seeking lips The sun lies hot across his back The gold is flecked across his wings Quivering he sways and quivering clings Ah rare her shoulders drawing back One moment then the plunderer slips Between the purple flower lips  Love passes out with a crash of cymbals There is a momentary pause and the music falls into its calm wave like rhythm  A band of boys passes before the curtain They pass from side to side crossing and re crossing but their figures never confuse one another the outlines are never blurred They stand out against the curtain with symbolic gesture stooping as if to gather up the wreaths or swaying with long stiff branch as if to sweep the fallen petals from the floor   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  There is no marked melody from the instruments but the boys voices humming lightly as they enter gradually evolve a little dance song There are no words but the lilt up and down of the boys tenor voices  Then as if they had finished the task of gathering up the wreaths and sweeping the petals they stand in groups of two before the pillars where the torches have been placed They lift the torches from the brackets They hold them aloft between them one torch to each two boys Their figures are cut against the curtain like the simple triangular design on the base of a vase or frieze the boys heads on a level the torches above them  They sing in clear half subdued voices  Where love is king Ah there is little need T o dance and sing With bridal torch to flare Amber and scatter light Across the purple air T o sing and dance T o flute note and to reed  Where love is come Ah love is come indeed Our limbs are numb Before his fiery need With all their glad Rapture of speech unsaid   H D  Before his fiery lips Our lips are mute and dumb  Ah sound of reed Ah flute and trumpet wail Ah joy decreed The fringes of her veil Are seared and white Across the flare of light Blinded the torches fail  Ah love is come indeed  At the end of the song the torches flicker out and the figures are no longer distinguishable in the darkness They pass out like shadows The purple curtain hangs black and heavy  The music dies away and is finally cut short with a few deep muted chords  II D   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  VERMILION SEALS  LIGHT OF LOVE  Nay bury her in her cloak she was not one To prison in a coffin At her head When you have strewn the earth with forest leaves Pile apricots and peaches apples red Plums oranges and grapes in one sweet heap There where shall hover breathless humming bees And birds that taste then sit and preen their wings  And at the foot I ask that you leave these Her slippers Then some shepherdess may try In vain to put them on or little fay Knotting her long green hair steal near to glance So may she know that I forget to day And think of her as when she used to dance  BELATED  At dusk a fox had run across my path And disappeared with smiling wicked eyes It was so dark I could not see my way Though all the fields were filled with fireflies And every tree had but one thing to breathe Among its leaves the words of an old song At fifteen even a devil s a thistle bloom The rice was murmurous as I went along Then in the darkness something brushed my sleeve White hands reached out to touch me in the gloom   Elizabeth J Coatsworth  Her words were like the bright quick fireflies At fifteen even a devil s a thistle bloom  SPRING IN CHINA  The earth s coat is the green of young willows Beside brown streams It is embroidered over with flowering trees Plum peach and apricot Her sleeves are scented wondrously Her hair is unbound in the wind Even the moon is so enamoured That ere dusk he climbs the stairs of heaven to behold her  THE GHOULS  All day the long cold fingers of the rain Have pried at the gray tiles above the graves Finishing the work of years in the drear fields Where coffins lie uncovered in the light Of sulphurous mustard blooms Here by the bank The greedy water has uncovered bones Shining blue white wet in the biting wind  THE CURSE  On the cord dead hangs our sister She of the wondrous lily feet They have blasted our fragrant flower   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  She shall curse them as is meet Hold the broom in her dead hand Raise her up until she stand Backward forward sweep the room Wealth and happiness and long life Sweeps she with avenging broom From the house where she was wife Backward forward sweep the broom Sweeping doom sweeping doom  Now the gods will surely punish Surely pity the young bride She was like a willow blossom It was springtime when she died Hold the broom in her dead hand Raise her up until she stand She was always flower gay Till they broke her smiling heart In this house she would not stay Take her up let us depart  LOVE TOWER  Prince Sung built Tsheng leng tower From which he might espy Dame Sik of the smoke like hair And willow waist go by  When the moon looked full at the sun In the month that the asters flower   Elizabeth J Coatsworth  Prince Sung bade them bring Dame Sik Into his gay tiled tower  Give thy handmaid leave to bathe And change her unworthy dress She will serve thee with napkin and comb As befits thy worshipfulness  She bathed and changed her robes In a warm slow autumn hour She smiled in the face of Prince Sung And leapt from the top of the tower  THE GATE  The dust is thick along the road The fields are scorching in the sun My wife has ever a bitter word To greet me when the day is done  The neighbors rest beside the gate But half their words are high and shrill My son is over young to help The fields are very hard to till  But in the dusk I raise my eyes The poet s words come back to me In the moon there is a white jade gate Shadowed cool by a cassia tree  Elizabeth J Coatsworth   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TWO CHRISTMAS POEMS  SUGA MICE  The Cock crows clear On Christmas morn Oooo oo oo oo To day a child Lies in the manger Where the brown ox Lies too Oooo oo oo oo Come and see him A beggar woman Kore him last night Worthless brazen hussy Put her out of my barn Said Grandam Send her to the poor house Could you not keep her One day I asked No indeed she said This is Christmas When I must serve my black pudding Burning in brandy And when thou Shalt see thy little tree Sparkling with candles And hung with gay sugar mice   Carolyn Hillman  But grandam Was not the Christ child Born in a manger too That was a different matter She said The cock crowed Three times Loud and clear Oooo oo oo oo Bastard brat In our barn Oooo oo oo oo Different Different Different But I slipped out to see him And take him a sugar mouse And all about his head Was a golden glory  WREATHS  Red wreaths Hang in my neighbor s window Green wreaths in my own On this day I lost my husband On this day you lost your boy On this day Christ was born Red wreaths   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Green wreaths Hang in our windows Red for a bleeding heart Green for grave grass Mary mother of Jesus Look down and comfort us You too knew passion You too knew pain Comfort us Who are not brides of God Nor bore God On Christmas day Hang wreaths Green for spent passion Red for new pain  Carolyn Hillman  THE VICTORS  The day star is painted red The sun stands red on the mountain They whisper our name In the land we are leaving  Sarah Unna   SONGS OF SILENCE  LITTLE CHIEF  The wind is wearing moccasins The wind is wearing moccasins It slides along the desert With stealthy feet at noon Upon the ditch it lightly treads And scarcely stirs the cottonwoods The nervous listening cottonwoods On tiptoe in the sun  The wind is wearing moccasins The wind is wearing moccasins It runs with crouching shoulders Its fingers sweep the ground With a sigh it makes a pathway Through the purple flowered alfalfa As it whispers dreams half mockingly To workers in the sun  SONG  Do you never tire O Silence And long to sing  Think you because you do not hear me I am not singing   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  HOUND AT NIGHT  I did not know how brittle Was the silence Till quick shrewd barks of a hound Pelted over the hills Breaking the stillness into fragments Like slivers of bright looking glass  REFLECTIONS  Where do you keep the secrets Mirror That drop like petals on your bosom And drift away in silence  OUTCAST  The waters cast him out A toppled tower of ivory His naked body lies upon the sands Nameless Beautiful Unreachable  Like a cloudy breath The Seeking thing within him Has gone forth To claim identity   Louise Ayres Garnett  I cannot weep as I see him Beautiful Venturesome Stripped and free  THE PRODIGAL  God has such a splendid way Of launching his unchallenged yea  Of giving sphery grapes their sheen Of painting trees and grasses green  Of crooning April rains that we May wash us in simplicity  Of swinging little smiling moons Beyond the reach of noisy noons  Of storing in the honey bee The whole of life s epitome  God has such a splendid way Of tempting beauty out of clay  And from the scattered dusts chat sleep Summoning men who laugh and weep  And by and by of letting death Draw into space our thread of breath  Louise Ayres Garnett   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  AN AWAKENING  Sleepy head sleepy head I believe the drowsy roses We have trampled so many nights Have got into your brain  Do you pretend to sleep still Under the thinning scarf of kisses And dream there is dawn and song and blossom For the awakening Of old lovers  Let me tell you A formal sheet covers us now And it is time of day we changed it For our proper working clothes  Lie quiet listen All night I have been hearing it There is a gate knocking A gate that taps against the latch A little wind has lifted in the garden Blowing the roses The gate keeps tapping  Here is new enchantment What does it say   Wilton Agnew Barrett  It is begun In the dark in the dark  There is a light lit on the desert There is a stir in the tent Goods are packed for the journey  In the dark the dark A caravan is moving The sand is broken A man is starting for birth  Wilton Agnew Barrett  WILD ASTER  With goldenrod now hand in hand  Gay summer rich and full of days Sends forth your proud and kingly band To lead her down the silent ways  And none that knows the path to death Goes with a statelier prouder tread Sing Aster with your dying breath The haughty paeans of the dead  John Russell McCarthy   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  AT THE TURN OF THE YEAR  I  On the last day of the old year retreating I walked upon a long flat road apart Between the gaunt trees far away the sunset Sent its last shaft of crimson to my heart  To eastward between branches blue and lifeless Were clouds encircling a pale ashen stain Wherein the moon peered like a sick old woman At a blurred window pane  The roadway filled with drear grey puddles Went stretching on a smudge of dirty brown Dimmer and duller every instant As the last daylight faded down  Faint lights gleamed from the sombre frowning house fronts But no one passed The roadway was quite bare It seemed to me that all the lives about me Were flickering out before some great despair  Horribly down the chill road the wind whistled As a dying man might breathe between clenched teeth I did not care I knew the New Year coming Would be less happy than the year beneath   John Gould Fletcher  II  Long ago my life had been a great sea raging With furious love and hate A lonely sea without a crag to break on Or coast to bear its weight  Long ago I madly longed for a settled purpose For bounds to give my thought And lo the purpose and the bounds were given But not the ones I sought  Long ago I had dreamed of distant unseen islands Tipped with white peaks covered with whispering pines But now I only found some straight dull mud banks Empty of human signs  Long ago I had lived as I would the world lay open There was no force to dread But now I was pushed along by a steady current Toward the gulf of the dead  Till at last at the turn of the year the banks closed inwards And I found I could only go Whither the meaningless will of the years would take me Far from the freedom of that long ago   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  III  Destiny s shadow settles on my forehead It falls on me as on all men alike I suddenly know that youth is taken from me Its hour will never strike  I suddenly know the old wild will that hurried me Onwards through joy and sorrow now is gone Under a sterner lash I drudge forever Toward my goal alone  Let other hearts enkindle every morning At the sun s uplifted hands I must go on alone in treacherous twilight Toward the dismal lands  Toward the kingdoms no man seeks to enter While over me each day Like a grey bird of the marshes wheels and rises And glides away  Glides away leaving the old ache in me burning More keen more unsubdued While deeper and deeper still there spreads about me My final solitude   John Gould Fletcher  IV  Water floats lazily through all the regions of heaven It writhes and flutters and rolls before the wind It bursts from the earth in springs it spreads in lakes and marshes It is unconfined  Strike it it does not break cut it it does not alter Throw torches upon it it yet consumes the flame Pen it with mighty rocks it rises ever higher To it mere sand or granite are the same  It trickles from the snows upon earth s topmost summits It pours in torrents through deep wooded lands It spreads out makes great lakes in lower valleys In deserts it flows yet beneath the sands  My soul in me is only moving water Poured out upon the black and sterile earth By thunder clouds that burst and loosed their burden Gathered for endless years before my birth  My soul in me has grown a monstrous river That moves straight onwards towards an unseen sea Rushing and straight and turbid never stopping From long banks never free   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Perhaps I shall come to the desert find about me Sand everywhere no end Perhaps I shall sink in the dust and all my being With formless earth shall blend  Perhaps with my current checked in its slow falling I shall spread out a broad lake for the sun Perhaps I shall wind about uneasy marshes For years my task undone  But neither desert nor lake nor marsh shall stop me From what I once began Free as the sea exultant in my freedom The life work of a man  And I shall work free at last and aloft as a leaping dragon To the sky I shall take my flight Flowing and reverberating through the empty halls of heaven Day after infinite day and night on endless night  RAIN  Rain rain in the night in the day nothing but rain Rain weaving evenly Its mantle of shadow Rain resting tenderly On the dead grey corpse of the earth   John Gould Fletcher  Rain whipping desperately The broken rocks and the blown sea coast Rain traveling high With great waving banners of black Over the upland fields  Rain rain in the night in the day dark rolling rain The grasses are full of it The wet bracken shivers The thistle stalks purple Are gleaming with pale drops The roads and the gullies Are filled with deep pools of it It smites at the lake s face And the face of the lake smites back  Rain rain in the night in the day long hissing rain The bird flocks skim desperately Across the grey marshes To scape from its coming The sea surges harsh At its white bar of sand Roaring and reeling It mounts from the ocean To strike at the earth To fill all the world With the sorrow of autumn The falling of leaves   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The flight of the wild birds The creaking of wagons laden with harvest Across the dim plain  I have woven a garment of sorrows Out of its falling A long loose garment of grey and shimmering sorrows Shot with strange shadows and old All men will shake in their houses As I walk in the wake of the rain cloud Fluttering my gleaming garment And singing a song that was taught me By the gulls screaming long with harsh voices To the dark clouds piled in the west off their coast That they may come hurrying To bury the summer the last of the year With the wind whipping through them Twisting and lashing  The long monotonous dreary unchanging dark folds of the rain  John Gould Fletcher  COMMENT  A SCIENTIST S CHALLENGE  AS CHRISTMAS approaches one year after the signing of the armistice the skies are not altogether clear International peace is officially imminent no doubt but unofficial and quite unauthorized battles are being fought in many a torn and starving province of distracted nations And in our own country industrial battles of giants remind us that peace in a modern democracy is a spiritual achievement of the crowd a sympathetic union of vast masses of all kinds of people not to be attained by the proclamation of governments  The immense reach of modern causes and issues the interdependence of all the peoples of the earth may well assure us that we live in a great age an age which gives more scope than any in past history for the vision and conquest of great minds and the free action of little ones Immersed in immediate pessimisms war s horrors the treaty s imperfections the coal strike the over loaded opulence of our time crowding out significant living and thinking the over strident near noises and far cries discordantly clamoring discouraged with all this seeming chaos we are too prone to forget the epic immensity of its challenge It is for the individual soul now as always before in the history of the race to master all this to see through the chaos of his time and resolve it into forms of power and beauty  In other words it is our job the job of the poets artists   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  scientists of our age to mold the future of the world Th e scientists are doing their part with sublime audacity are the poets and other artists doing theirs  It may be wise to search our consciences for an answer to certain accusations which I find summarized by one of the greatest constructive scientists now living Charles P Steinmetz chief consulting engineer of the General Electric Company whose demoniacal no god like turbines deal out light and power all over the world Dr Steinmetz contributes an introduction to a book by Charles M Ripley  E E entitled Romance of a Great Factory and privately printed at Schenectady New York The introduction opens with the following quotation from some tritely palavering academician  We are living in an unromantic age Before the shriek of the locomotive the wood nymphs have fled and the factory whistle has driven away the romance of the old times Art and poetry cannot flourish in our cold engineering age  Dr Steinmetz comments as follows  Thus says the professor of literature dissecting the master works  of by gone ages from Homer to Goethe and telling us what literary  art is  Why do our literary men of today write best sellers books  whose only redeeming feature is that they are forgotten as quickly  as sold They fail to see the wonders of our day the greatest in  the world s history they find nothing worthy of their literary skill  in our cold engineering age But over and again they repeat  the story of erotic sentimentalism running up and down the scale  from hysteria to pathological degeneration Hopelessly out of touch  with the world of today they see nothing in it except sensual ero  tics of the more hysterical types  When Homer wrote the Iliad and the Odyssey he told us of the  adventures of his age the conquest of Troy the wanderings of the   A Scientist s Challenge  navigator through the terrors of the ocean at the dawn of history Three thousand years later in his autobiography Faust Goethe tells us the adventures and aspirations of his age from the youthful efforts to conceive the absolute groping after the ideal of the true and beautiful up to the satisfaction of sedate manhood helping mankind to conquer Nature and make the earth a better place in which to live  The great writers of the past wrote of the age in which they lived but the writers of today are out of touch with the Twentieth Century  Those of us who have the education the leisure and inclination can put ourselves back into by gone ages enjoy their literary master works and travel with Homer through the terrors of the Mediterranean but to most of us the only known world is the world of today of the steam ship and the railway train the factory and mill the electric light telegraph and motor  Is there no poetry in this world of ours Do we really lack romance in this scientific and engineering Twentieth Century Or is it not rather that the ignorance of the average literary man disables him to see the romance of our age  There is more poetry more romance in the advances which we have seen in our life time than ever Homer described  We navigate not only the surface of the Mediterranean but its very depths by submarine We fly to the higher altitudes of the skies by aeroplane We fling the human voice over thousands of miles across continents and oceans by telephone Unborn generations will hear the living voice of our musicians bequeathed to them by the phonograph Our great great grandchildren will see in action our prominent men of today recorded and everlastingly perpetuated by the cinematoscope that new historian of these great times  There is romance in the life of the vigilant mariner who listens to  the wireless message from distant shores There is tragedy in the  fate of the giant battle cruiser There is romance in that  mighty spinning top the steam turbine fed by the stored sun light  of prehistoric ages ages when ferns were giant trees and our an  cestors were crawling things in the slime on the shores of the lagoon  not very long ago as time is counted in the universe  In the modern factory there is far more romance and poetry than  there has ever been in the history of the past but we must be living  with it to see and understand it That is we must be living with  the men of our century and not sheltered in the dust of past ages   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Dr Steinmetz who still delights in Homer and Horace  does not believe in close specialization Recently he said  Tell your young engineers to read poetry and history and study the old fashioned humanities The trained specialist who is nothing but a specialist is only a tool in the hands of broader minded men who use him and pass him by  It is evident that the man of science is the romanticist of our age the poet is a hard and cold seeker of truth in comparison with the modern fire bringer Dr Steinmetz challenge should prove suggestive he raises interesting questions as to the scope and function of art If our poets are moved to reply POETRY would like to continue the discussion H M  THE BUSINESS OF POETRY  I am riding through Arizona in the Pullman I am thinking of the business of poetry Every other man attends to the details of business if he is a good business man A train is mostly business men   Poets must it seems to me learn how TO use a great many words before they can know how to use a few skilfully Journalistic verbiage is not fluency Alfred Kreymborg agrees with me that poets do not write prose often enough I speak mostly of the poets who do not write with the sense of volume in their brevities Brevity of all things demands intensity or better say tensity Tensity comes from experience The poet must see the space for the word and then see to it the word occupies it It is almost mechanical science   The Business of Poetry  these days it would seem the fitting of parts together so the whole produces a consistent continuity Subjects never matter excepting when they are too conspicuously autobiographical Moi même quand même is attractive enough but there are so many attractive ways of presenting it Personal handling counts for more than personal confessions We can even learn to use hackneyed words like rose and lily relieving them of Swinburnian encrustations We can relieve imagery from this banality  Poets cannot as aspiring poets depend it seems to me ever upon the possible natural flow that exists in themselves Poets have work to do for the precision of simplicity and for the gift of volume in simplicity It is the business of good poetry to show natural skill as well as natural impetus Some poets would like to say the former is more important It surprises one a deal how much even the better poets effuse or rely upon their momentary theories The subject calls for handling not for enthusiams Painters of this time have learned this or ought to have learned it by now with the excellent examples of the time Personality is a state it is not the consummate virtue It begins but it does not finish anything We have eventually to insert in the middle spaces all we can of real ability What is much needed is solidity even of sentiment combined with efficacy of form This might be served as an injunction to some of the girl poets Poets have not so much to invent themselves as to create themselves and creation is of course a process of development   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  We are to remember that Ingres with his impeccable line was otherwise almost nothing else but silhouette We cannot subsist merely upon silhouette in poetry nor upon the pantomimic gesture only For every lightness there must be a conscious structure Watteau was the genius of lightness in gesture No one will accuse him or even his pupils Lancret or Pater of emptiness A fan has structure by which it exists a structure that calls for delicate artistry in mechanics The aeroplane is propelled by motors weighing tons made of solid metals and is directed by a master mechanic Its own notion of lightness would never get it off the ground Poetry will never fly on the notion of its mere lightness for lightness is not triviality Francis Thompson had a wing in his brain but he had feet also Those men were not mere personalities They were master mechanics in the business of poetry A bird could never rely upon the single strong feather Poetry might rather well take up the mania of Flaubert if only as a stimulus to exactitude of feeling and idea You find the best poets doing all they can of that or else intending that  The fierce or fiery spaciousness is the quality we look for in a real poem and coupled with that the requisite iron work according to the personal tastes of the poet The mere gliding of musical sequences is not sufficient Poetry is not essentially or necessarily just vocalism It may have plot or it may be plotless that is for the poet to decide what is wanted is some show of mechanistic precision such as the poet can devise He must know his motive as well as him   The Business of Poetry  self and to invent the process of self creation is no little task That is the first principle to be learned by the versifiers Poetry is not only a tool for the graving of the emotions nor is it an ivory trinket It calls for an arm We need not be afraid of muscularity or even of brutality  It is a refreshing omen that big poets write but little poetized autobiography We find it so much in small poetry poetry written behind moral arrasses where the writer looks out upon a clear space with longing Anyone would best set it aside and get outside of himself and among the greater trivialities Preoccupation blocked introspection are old fashioned stimuli for modern poetry Painting has become definitely masculine at last in its substance mechanistic in its purport Delicacy and frankness are not necessarily feminine Nor are strength and vigor necessarily muscular qualities What Mr Untermeyer pleases to call the cult of brutality does not apply to the poets he names unless he regards all great poetry as delicate and good You may find the most infinite tenderness in Masters in Wallace Gould and in the others whom he names He chooses to call picturing brutality Brutality exists only in the preferential attitude No one finds Whitman brutal One finds him presenting the picture Yet the effect of Whitman on the sick soul as William James calls it is essentially a brutal one His simple frankness hurts He removes the loin cloth because it always hints at secrecy and cheap morality He undresses the body we are forever dressing He thinks it handsomest so He is right It is a poor body that   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  doesn t look best without clothes Nature is naked and not to speak tritely quite unashamed It has no moralistic attitude It has no attitude at all It is therefore natural  Frost writes of New England and the natives say they know nothing of that New England The native who looks in from the outside with a world vision says How familiar He doesn t say How cold how forbidding Masters would probably not wish to live by his Spoon River yet his later books are just other shades of the same powerful grey Wallace Gould will not want to live by his so dreadful Out of Season in Children of the Sun yet his books will probably always be tense and severe Wallace Stevens thinks or at least says he isn t interested in producing a book at all Well that is superbly encouraging It is not therefore what the poet thinks of that is the delicacy of his subject He is looking for the mechanism by which to render subject with the precision called for by his feelings and attitudes toward it  I personally would call for more humor in poetry If it is true with poetry as with the play that almost anyone can write a drama or a tragedy while the comedy man is rare this would at least account for the lack of charming humor in verse Satire is delectable as Henry James has shown Even the so serious minded Emily Dickinson had her inimitable gift of humor She did the best kind of fooling with God An intellectual playfulness with great issues she certainly had to an irresistible degree  A quotation from someone apropos of Rainer Maria Rilke   The Business of Poetry  stating that The poet in order to depict life must take no part in it offers a fine truism He is of necessity the looker on How else He must see first and feel afterward or perhaps not feel at all Modern expression teaches that most noticeably Real art comes from the brain as we know not from the soul We have the excellent examples of this in Mary Garden and Mrs Fiske fine refutations of the attitude toward femininity It is a geometric of self invention art purposes to create The poet it seems must learn this along with the other artists of the time Art of the time is the art of the mechanism of the time We must make poetry of today according to the theme of radio telephony and of commutation over oceans by the plane We cannot feel as we do and attempt Keats simplicities or Keats lyricism even We have other virtues and defects We are not melodists  Cacophonists then We do not concentrate on the assonant major alone We find the entire range of dissonance valuable as well as attractive Or is it all a fierce original harmonic we are trying to achieve  There is no less need of organization even if we do not employ the established metre and rhyme Likewise if a poet must state his or her personal history he or she may be asked to be as brief as possible It is easier to read epigrams than to read the diary no matter how short the latter may be The age of confession perished with the Parnassians We are a vastly other type of soul if we are soul at all which I keenly doubt The poet s attitude then for today is toward the outside This does not necessarily imply surface   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  We present ourselves in spite of ourselves W e are most original when we are most like life Life is the natural thing Interpretation is the factitious Nature is always variable T o have an eye with brain in it that is or rather would be the poetic millenium W e are not moonlit strummers now we are gun pointers and sky climbers  Marsden Hartley  CALIFORNIA S LAUREATE  Out on the Coast they are certainly loyal to their own artists W e commend the following item taken from The Writer to the attention of other states among the forty eight starred on our flag  California has a State Poet Laureate made such by legislative action recorded in Chapter 61 California Statutes of 1919 p 1537 as follows  Whereas Ina Coolbrith of San Francisco California has brought prominently to the attention of the world the glories and beauties of California s fruits and flowers its climate its scenery its wealth and possibilities through her many brilliant poems and has contributed to the high standing of our literature thereby winning the admiration and gratitude of all loyal Californians and is truly deserving of our most favorable recognition and mention therefore be it  Resolved by the senate the assembly concurring that Ina Coolbrith be hereby recognized and given the honorary title of The Loved Laurel crowned Poet of California  Miss Coolbrith was a friend of Bret Harte and was associated with him in the editorship of the Overland Monthly Her first book of verse A Perfect Day and Other Poems was published in 1884 and The Singer of the Sea Songs from the Golden Gate in 1895 When the writer made a   California s Laureate  pilgrimage to her during the Pan American Exposition she found a white haired lady of great dignity and charm living in a beautiful little house nobly placed on a high hill a house presented to her long ago so it was said by admiring fellow citizens of San Francisco This year unfortunately her health has been somewhat impaired and she has crossed the continent for a complete change of climate She expects to spend the winter in New York where she will bring out a new book of poems  The act of the California legislature is a gracious and well deserved tribute H M  REVIEWS  A LINCOLN PRIMER  Abraham Lincoln a Play by John Drinkwater Hough  ton Mifflin Co  We owe Mr Drinkwater a debt of gratitude for discovering and using the rich material of poetic drama afforded by Lincoln s public career and for proving his point with skilful dramaturgy in the making of an actable play We may thank him also for his simplicity and sincerity in the handling of his material But beyond that our gratitude cannot go very far not here in the United States not here in Illinois  His play uses with a certain effectiveness the primer method only the obvious simplicities of a great character are admitted only the most recognizable lines of the portrait   POETRY A M a g a zi n e of V e r s e  are drawn The twice told tales are all here and affairs of state the committee from a presidential convention meetings of the cabinet etc are telescoped as the author puts it into the homely talk of three or four neighbors Strong characters like Seward Stanton and Chase are made to toe the mark of submission and the central figure is magnified by a process of elimination and by a moralistic attitude of mind in presenting him  This is all very well there is much to be said for the primer method In England where little is known of Lincoln it may have served quite effectively to introduce him But it is not adult and the precedent of English praise English success should not impose it on the American people in whose heart that rich humorous melancholy profoundly impassioned tragic figure is a most precious spiritual inheritance It would be little short of a calamity if all our deep musing all our imagining all our sorrowing love of this great leader should be interfered with by this English version made up of literary echoes and quite innocent of background  Some critics have implied that the absence of what they call local color was a negligible minor fault to be easily remedied by a few slight corrections of diction dialect and other discrepancies They might as well say that a lion of the jungle reveals his power as effectively in a cage Lincoln was part of his environment literally he grew out of the soil of Illinois spiritually he was a son of the pioneers Artistically he belongs deep in his own country and probably   A Lincoln Primer  only a fellow countryman poet certainly only a vividly localizing imagination can place him where he belongs And the trouble is that not local color merely but all color is absent from this sketch in grisaille of a figure whose richness only a colorist like Rembrandt could achieve  Of course it is our intimacy with Lincoln our intense delight in him and love of him which has kept our literary hands off Whitman was lifted by Lincoln s martyrdom to the sublime height of a great elegy and many other poets have brought tributes but only the sculptors as yet have tried to present him in the round To Mr Drinkwater of course he is myth a mine of dramatic material as valuable and almost as remote as Charlemagne or King Arthur But whereas Charlemagne and King Arthur are bedded deep in the rich medieval poetic tradition populous and haunted with the peoples of a dozen worlds real and magical Lincoln in the mind of a modern Englishman stands gaunt and lonely and unrooted Mr Drinkwater picks him up out of his own place and sets him down in a manufactured milieu where the people do not think his thoughts nor speak his tongue and even the chairs don t look natural  The dialogue is written in prose but the key note of poetic chronicle is struck and maintained by the choral introductions and interludes There is much to praise in Mr Drinkwater s revival of a form rashly pronounced obsolete and in his structural use of it the effectiveness of the curtains for example Also his attitude toward his hero is straight and simple free of patronage on the one hand or   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  subservience on the other I would praise too his effective use of the one valuable trait which history has revealed in the very trying character of Mrs Lincoln her early andlate faith in her husband s greatness H M  THE NEW IMAGES  Images new edition with additions by Richard Aldington  The Egoist London  It is a pleasure to be assured that these exquisite poems  have been sufficiently appreciated to demand a second edition The personality of the book is strengthened by the addition of a few poems from magazines and the imagist anthologies and by the deletion of two whose manner and perhaps conception even seemed to flutter on uncertain wings  As the poet states in the preface to his latest work War and Love the poems in Images were the outcome of a spiritual struggle They were a sort of armor of imagined beauty which the poet drew about himself as a protection against an unlovely environment He ventured abroad in his world of imagined beauty with sure footstep and a strong heart But the reader who would follow him should be a robust esthete lest he strangle in the rarity of the atmosphere  From one point of view it is as if this book were the embodiment of that condition spoken of in Scripture as the dividing asunder of soul and spirit For one feels very keenly the poignant desire of the senses to be united with the spirit from which they seem to be separated forever   The New Images  Rather it would seem curiously enough that the longing is actually of the spirit itself Thus a little sight of celestial loneliness comes wafted down to mortal ears  We pluck the asphodel Yet we weave no crowns For we have no vines No one speaks here No one kisses  But the mortal who hears even if moved by an understanding could not give comfort any more than the senses could unite with the spirit It is a beautiful state of mind similar to that of some children who half expect to awaken at almost any moment and find themselves moving about in an enchanted world  Despite the suggestions of a few words like spirit and celestial in this note there is very little in these poems which is really metaphysical Since the war in which Mr Aldington had an active part more people know to some degree that metaphysics is going to help us think through and find out where we are After a book like War and Love it would be odd to see Mr Aldington reverting to a style and state of mind from which a good many of the Images were drawn  In the book there are poems Choricos for example which move along in measures of unforgettable music In contrast with poems of a Greek mood and nomenclature are  The River Epigrams Beauty thou hast Hurt me Overmuch In the Old Garden which seem to interest more directly by their own virtue   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Among those which have been newly added are The Faun Captive with its especially beautiful opening lines Fantasy  R V and Another Captive and this Inarticulate Grief which is as fine as anything in the volume  Let the sea beat its thin torn hands In anguish against the shore Let it moan Between headland and cliff Let the sea shriek out its agony Across waste sands and marshes And clutch great ships Tearing them plate from steel plate In reckless anger Let it break the white bulwarks Of harbor and city Let it sob and scream and laugh In a sharp fury With white salt tears Wet on its writhen face Ah let the sea still be mad And crash in madness among the shaking rocks For the sea is the cry of our sorrow  Mark Turbyfill  ON THEIR WAY  Gargoyles by Howard Mumford Jones Cornhill Co Banners by Babette Deutch George H Doran Co The New Day by Scudder Middleton Macmillan Co Blue Smoke by Karle Wilson Baker Yale Univ Press  Some are born poets may others achieve poetry Books like those listed above tempt one to ask this question Or perhaps the question is slightly different may one who has a certain aptitude and love of the art win out finally through   On Their Way  hard work and the sloughing off of faults to a poetic expression of his vision which though not magical not a flame of divine fire may yet glow with a certain authentic if more earthly beauty  Mr Jones for example comes slowly to artistic maturity his book is almost entirely practice work the literary exercises of a man overburdened with impedimenta and slow and stubborn in getting rid of them But it contains a few poems notably A Song of Butte which begin to win free  Most of the book baffles one so much knowledge feeling intuitive psychology unfused into forms of power or beauty The author loves the Lake Michigan dunes no doubt but he must desecrate them with the rusty machinery of pettier spaces unloading a whole pack of fairy shallops mermaids pixies elves and dryads or when he gets nearer to his subject as in November or Night he is still impeded by an inherited stanza form too trivial to relate itself to the wild spaciousness of the dunes  In His Mother one grants the poet s intuition of the vampire parent s psychology while regretting the prosiness of the sonnets which unfold it The University Sketches also are true expositions of human character The Professor Muses especially presents effectively in blank verse monologue the teacher s shy sympathy with the young things who stream through his classroom But mostly one feels the philosopher rather than the poet one finds statement rather than song Even a dreaming professor cannot evoke Venus herself by crying   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Ah Aphrodite Thou dead thou deathless goddess Sprung of the wind and the wave and the clean sweet foam  And the three or four Sketches in poetic prose carry for me an imitative Nietzschean pose  A Song of Butte seems the best thing in the book because though still somewhat rhetorical it conquers and carries its medium makes a living unified vital portrait of a somewhat sinister modern town  I am the city demoniac Desolate mournful infernal  Dweller apart among and upon the amazing hills  It is a portrait with passion and beauty in it worthy to stand beside Mary MacLane s revelation of the beauty and terror of Butte Unfortunately it is too long to quote  Miss Deutsch s book is of a more modern expertness but perhaps her struggle is less severe her vision of life less clouded with metaphysical veils Too many of her poems are an assertion of emotion rather than the emotion itself It is not enough for example to call a poem Bacchanal and cry  Oh we are mad  We are drunk with wine of the god  Our feet are athrill with the juice of the vine we have trod  Nor does Trails quite persuade us even granting its keen touch at the end  But a few of the poems are vividly descriptive like a good landscape of fresh color Ephemeris Smoke Genre In two or three Song Walls Solitude a real emotion is expressed with lyric brevity and directness And once or twice deeper   On Their Way  feeling molds the poems into a finer beauty In this Death of a Child sharp pain uses effectively the practiced hand  Are you at ease now Do you suck content From death s dark nipple between your wan lips Now that the fever of the day is spent And anguish slips From the small limbs And they lie lapped in rest The young head pillowed soft upon that indurate breast No you are quiet And forever Though for us the silence is so loud with tears Wherein we hear the dreadful footed years Echoing but your quick laughter never Never your stumbling run your sudden face Thrust in bright scorn upon our solemn fears Now the dark mother holds you close Oh ou We loved so How you lie So strangely still unmoved so utterly Dear yet but oh a little alien too  Mr Middleton s book is mostly rhymed eloquence such poems as 1919 and The Poets are moralistic and rhetorical and Children is labored and over expansive It is rather the briefer poems in The New Day which give one a breath of hope because of a delicate touch in them a flavor a perfume One may mention especially Interlude Dream Rover Burial and this Carnival  Why do you go before the maple leaves Open like little hands to welcome spring O lovely woman is your heart afraid Of all the truths the trees of April bring  Just when the carnival begins you go Alone I watch the dancing of the earth   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Though you may raise the cloak before your face You cannot hide the meaning of this mirth  In Mrs Baker s book one finds a slight but delicate lyric strain impeded by difficulties and sentimentalities but gradually gaining clarity and precision Some of the poems date back more than a decade to the days when Charlotte Wilson was a familiar name in the magazines The sonnet written in 1910 at the too early death of William Vaughn Moody moves one in spite of its stumbling gait by its quiet simplicity and sincerity  A few of the later poems show the same qualities with a more expert handling Apple and Rose for example or Graves in France or this Eagle Youth  They have taken his horse and plume They have left him to plod and fume For a hero s scope and room They have curbed his fighting pride They have bade him burrow and hide With a million side by side Look into the air he springs Fighting with wings  He had found a way to be free Of that dun immensity That would swallow up such as he Who would burrow when he could fly He will climb up into the sky And the world shall watch him die Only his peers may dare Follow him there  H M   A Few First Books  A FEW FIRST BOOKS  Petals Blown Adrift by Rose Florence Freeman Joseph Ishill Co Although this author issued a book of poems in 1918 we  are reviewing her new one under the above heading as most of the poems in her first book Rain among the Bamboos are to be found in the last twenty pages of this one It is important to know that Petals Blown Adrift claims to be a first book and it is only upon granting such a claim that we feel concerned in it Bad books of poetry leave a reviewer fearing that the world has grown deaf and half dumb with eyes squinting This unsatisfactory book instead leaves one with a certain hope and with no unpleasant feelings towards it It is unsatisfactory it says nothing or nearly nothing it is more unsatisfactory because a certain loveliness of wording and the indubitable facility of some of the rhyme poems lure the reader and then baffle him lure him to baffle him There are appearances of strength and forcefulness but strength about or upon what forcefulness enforcing what No no strength no vision merely assertions such as I have seen a vision I am strong I am very strong no mood but the assurance that a mood is or was there No actual experience though one feels that the writer has felt Nothing to quote or perhaps this which comes nearer to being a specific utterance than anything else in the book  In the bitterest and most holy moment Each stands on his own little peak crying across the hills Hearing none other but Self and Echo   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  or this  My limbs are drunk sheer through as fields with rain  Satiated  It is not a book then but a lovely voice heard from quite a distance singing perhaps well but one can t make out either the words or the tune That it is a lovely voice I am sure because these commonplaces this impotence are not jarring as such things usually are the composite sound of them is an inarticulate but not unpleasant hum That is an effect of the author s not yet fully realized fine sensual delight in words If the author should ever come nearer to her own moods and consequently to us we should hear a good song She has been tuning up  Dreams and Gibes by Edward Sapir Poet Lore Co  Here is the voice of a cynically wistful man his struggle to express common human reactions to a common human world One senses through the dry and dim words of Edward Sapir the seriousness of his task and the lack of loveliness in the book is to a certain extent the aspect of the author s own soul honesty redeems much that is ungainly in it But of course the redemption is not complete sheer honesty and stark seriousness are in themselves beautiful and no redemption would be necessary if they were present The exclusion of loveliness not being radical austerity and hardness are not achieved And such hardness and austerity as one finds here are not sufficiently mellowed by other elements but only adulterated by them   A Few First Books  The Omega and Other Poems by Edward Shillito B H  Blackwell Oxford Eng  Mr Shillito is characteristically the average good rhymer of today Smothering under a heap of vague metaphors old words lines that might have been just transplanted from any book of poems of the last century or before are the sorrow and the mysticism of a man of today a living man of an actual today One does not doubt his faith in Christ most of the poems are religious and yet one is not moved by it Christ is in Mr Shillito s heart but he presents him to us with so much rhetorical trapping reminding us of so many other Christs we have seen that we cannot differentiate his from the others  And yet a man of today is alive under this borrowed cloak For a cloak it is and it is extraneous to the body it covers Rhymes are too often that in our days a borrowed cloak hiding an impotent body or a dress covering a body which would be fine but for the fact that it needs such a dress This last is almost exactly the case of Mr Shillito s poems  Out of Doors and Gods and Devils by John Russell Mc  Carthy James T White amp Co  Puns and jokes and little witty words about trees and flowers McCarthy s Out of Doors is such stuff as makes the conversation and repartee of hiking parties of gentlefolk When it gets too strong it hurts one looks as though the author were jeering flowers and trees to get an ingratiating smile from the rest of the hiking party Images that so ob   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  viously affect to be unexpected and are so stale and literary as to make one astonished at their daring and somewhat ashamed of their lack of self consciousness Faceless humor and laughter The way flowers and trees all speak to him and the way he so flippantly and girlishly repeats to the profane the conversation Here are some of the stunts he asserts that the lily of the valley is  weary of white and white and white And long silk stockings of green You want to be dirty and happy tonight You re tired of being clean  She wants to go fighting and scratching for blood  And he invites some trees to  Come forth to laugh and dine like gods upon the hills  The other book Gods and Devils is not so awful Though I am not sure that even such a compliment should be paid to this hybrid grafting of such Oppenheimian rant as  Come let us make us a God  on the idiotic naivete of  There is not a God in the sickly typewritten category can keep one small boy away from the movies  Now why this outpouring of viciousness over a book that doesn t even deserve that I will tell you Once a girl said to me The matter with poets is that they re all sissies Well not all but the centuries are overflowing with such poetic molasses and when as acute a case as this comes under the eyes of a reader of poetry he feels that he   A Few First Books  is at last entitled to raise the dam of his ancient irritation  which has become vicious with time and repression  E C  NOTES  Our readers need no introduction to H D Mrs Richard Aldington of London the most imagistic of the imagists
