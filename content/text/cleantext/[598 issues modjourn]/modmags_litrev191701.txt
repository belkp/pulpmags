one talks about Art when he wants to be interestingWhether he knows anything about it or not makes no differenceYou can tell a man that unless he s an expert in interstate railway regulation he mustn t argue with a man who isThat sounds sensible to him and he will defer to the expertBut if you tell him that he mustn t argue with an artistnot being one himselfhe considers your remark insultingSome people condemn artists and their wayssome praise their work and condemn their wayssome imitate their ways and patronize their Worksome believe in their work and discredit the whole scale of values on which alone such work could be builtThe latter seem to be the most numerous in these daysand they are the most exasperatingBut all of them together act the same way when it comes to talking about ArtIf the artist disagrees with them they are sure he is in the wrongand if in their eloquence they have tried to make him out a fool it s difficult to understand their rage when the artist says Very wellyou are not an artistwhy should we be expected to agreeYou can tell a man that he knows nothing about philology or philosophyor metaphysics or comparative religions or science or Copyright1917by Margaret CAnderson The Little Review plumbing or gardeningand he will confess that he doesn tAs for aestheticshe can t deny fast enough any connection with such a subjectas though it were something beneath his characterBut the moment Art is mentioned the thing seems to have become personaland you realize from his angry or injured air that not to know about Art is a sin instead of a lacka thing one can be blamed fora matter not to be compared to an incapacity for metaphysics or plumbingfor some mysterious reasonThis is the great emotional mindholding itself proudly above the much maligned lay mind but really only articulating the beloved theories of them bothThe lay mind says I don t know anything about Art but I know what I like The emotional mind says I am capable of being moved profoundlyand what moves me is Art Here are the articles of its faithevery one of them as untrue as education can make themIt believesThat beauty is lovelinessbeauty is art truth is arttruth is beautybeauty truthtaste is artreproduction is arttechnique is formstyle is formThatsignificant formis an unstable quantity They say What is beautiful to you is ugly to meTherefore what is art to you is not art to meThereforehow can you say what is artThat there is no distinction between feelings and imaginationan emotional experience is the same as an aesthetic experiencethe fundamental impulse

superstitionsart is to dissipate realitythe social vision implies the creative visionman s organic necessity to listen to music or be thrilled by poetryis identical with the art impulseThat to live

powerThat special knowledge means special intelligenceThat one must experience to knowThat facts or fancies belong to artThat a poetic temperament makes a poetThat to act with great feeling and passion is to be a great actorThat tobe Mary Garden in every role she doesis to be a bad actressThatthe books we read and rereadare those that stand the test of literatureThat the artist escapes from life into beautyThat thisescapeis a falsification of lifeThat criticism should be sincere and unprejudicedThat artist and genius are identical termsFinallythat art is the expression of the whole manas even MrWillard Huntington Wright and The Seven Arts believeIt is notIt is the expression of the thing that man brings into the world with himHis life is the expression of the whole manHis art is the

grand operanot of singing classesGrand operalike a great hand whose fingers are the different artsis trying to give us what the closed hand holdsGalli Curci has undone the critics for adjectives of praisehas fulfilled the hopes of managersand filled the Auditorium with the sleep walking public We have had Muratore with his beautiful voice and his treacle personality We have had efficient and awful Wagnerian singersWe have had satisfaction in our operaAnd now comes Mary Gardenso surcharged with life that she sends a thrill of it before her Mary Garden who outsings the composer in her feelingwho outpaints the painter in her actingwho outsculps the sculptor with her bodyMary Garden gives us grand operashe gives what the closed hand holdsAnd so the fight will begin again and the old favorite record will be put on all the cheap human talking machines Of course Mary Garden can t singbut she can act Grand opera by its very character is outside such simple criticism as thisit is outside all talk of voice production or singing off key Or distracting the conductorThere is a measurable value in the component parts of any artbut the test that cannot be analyzed lies in the unity of these partsThis unity is the principle of ArtBut grand opera is a composite of the artsand the true test for it should lie in the unity of the employed artsnot in weighing any part of any one artPeople will rave for days if Mary Garden fails in a note although the aesthetic and emotional experience of the whole was unmarredbut the same people will never be disturbed if Galli Curci moves about the stage like a lost cloakmodjel and breaks up the picture of the whole illusion by holding her body in positions not possible in human awkwardnessand is so intent on breathing that she almost forgets to attend to Juliet s funeralSo long as she sings according to a fixed standard she need go no further than a movingThe Little Review 7 picture screenAnd Mary must be decriedthough her performance hold in color like a tapestry and move in rhythm like a friezeWhen anything is as far from life as sung dialogue it must have a different treatment than either pure song or pure

actors that can point the design not in the realistic day life manner of the drama but with decorative actingWith this we might have great grand operaOne thing we have nowthe great decorative actress and singerMary GardenMary Garden is the biggest thing on our horizon todayTo think that flesh could be so intelligentShe gives as generously of her undraped body as a Rodin statueand the audience gives her back their applausegrudginglynot knowing the great art of herTo put Rodin into inspired motionbut to do more than that even In the next issue I shall try to write of all she doesMary Garden This Cyprian She is a millionmillion changing thingsShe brings more joy than any godshe brings More painI cannot judge herMay it be An hour of mercy when she looks on me What Is Art WHEN Tagore first gave his lecture on Art in Chicago I was not hereand all I could read about it or find out about it by asking was that it was anti TolstoyanBut I got the whole truth of it in a sentence when I asked a pupil of Tagore sa young artist What does Mr Tagore say in his lecture on ArtWhat does he sayOhhe just says what it isthis Art Every layman in this country who finds it necessary to establish himself a critic of Art and artists should hear that lecture and try to understand itif only in partsBut I suppose they wouldn t accept Tagore s word for it because he doesn t take them in on the ground floorin the manner of The Seven Artsfor instanceI can t quote directlyas the lecture is not yet publishedbut he has said all the things that one longs to say oneselfH e defines the artist as one who says to the world I see you where you are what I am Art is the most personal thing in the worldMan reveals himself and not his objects in ArtMatter and manner find their harmonics in our personalityThe artist does not particularize through peculiaritywhich is the discord of the uniquebut through the personalitywhich is its harmonyArt is man s answer to theSupreme Person Art is personal and beyond scienceSotoois beautyBeauty is not a fact but an expression Facts are like wine cups that carry it T o all the confusion and misconceptions about beauty in Art he answersThe creation of beauty is not the object of ArtBeauty in Art has merely been an instrument and not its complete and ultimate significanceAnd to those who demand teaching or utility in Art there is this answerThe stageof pure utility is like a state of heat which is darkWhen it surpasses itself it becomes white heat and then it is expressiveand when man thwarts his desire for delightwanting to make it into good or into knowledgeit loses its bloom and healthinessTaking up the old controversy of Art for Art s sakethe fact that the phrase has fallen into disrepute is a sign of the return of the ideals of the puritanic age when enjoyment as an end in itself was held to be sinfulThe idea of Art for Art s sake had its origin in a surplusage of lifenot in asceticism or decadenceWhen our personality is at its flood tide with love or other emotion it longs to express itself for the sake of expressionand we forget the claims of usefulness and the thrift of necessityAfter all the fighting and arguing one has to do up and down the world over what is Artand Art for Art s sakeone comes from this lecture feeling He leadeth me beside the still watershe maketh me to lie down in green pastureshe restoreth my soul Little Theatre Atrocities LAST month the Chicago Little Theatre strayed down into the Playhouse with MrsWarren s ProfessionI won t say anything about the actingnor even of MrsWarren and her Oak Park vulgarity MrsWarren of LondonBrusselsBudapestBut I can t let the scenery go by without a protestThere is a subtle but definite sense of analogy of line which goes through all the artsIt is obvious in acting and paintingWhy shouldn t it be sought in decoration when decoration is dependent upon wordsBernard Shaw has perhaps but one line the straight horizontal lineHe cuts through clear and straight a cross section of lifeHe brings people and The Little Review all their relations out upon this broad flat planeThat s ShawI didn t mind thai the text of MrsWarren called for period architectureit was the insistence on the long perpendicular line that maddened meAnd the colorTheretoowas a chance for lineBut wellwho can tell how bad the performance was with the futile effort of the denying horizontal lines of the play against the asserting perpendicular lines of the sceneryMoore and More I HAVE been reading Frank Harris in Pearson s on George Moore s The Brook KerithWhat MrHarris really does is to jump on George Moore for not writing a history of the life of Chistthe sociologybiologyand geology of JerusalemOnly in books of information and science does the writer have to submerge his personality and let the facts have first placeBut MrMoore thought he was making a work of artand here no one will deny the first right to the personality of the artistMrHarris cavils about typeslandscapescustomsetcAlmost the only presentation of Christ outside the Bible has been in paintingHave those paintersdefiled our most sacred spiritual possessionswhofrom the daywhen Florence knelt in her streets before Cimabue s Madonnahave painted every incident in the life of Christ and of the Holy Family in every setting from an Italian pasture to a Medici palaceusing Italian typesItalian dressItalian gesturesHas the great El Greco defiled the Christian religion because he painted Spanish Christs and saints in tomb damp colorsDid Michael Angelo dethrone God because in his Creation he painted him with beard and flowing robe on his own authorityAnd the Germans and the DutchThey must have been all leagued togethertomisrepresent through ignorance according to such critics as MrHarrisBut who can say that they have not raised the tradition to a height the old Jews dared not dream AE THERE is a great interest in America just now over AEpoetpaintermystical teacherlabor leadereconomistand editorThere are lectures by Columreviews of his booksstudies of his lifea revival of the reading of George Moore s Salve where he is portrayed with such loveand in January we are to have an exhibition of his paintings brought from Ireland by a Chicago woman at her own expense and loaned to the Art InstituteTo my knowledge only once before have any of AEs paintings been seen in ChicagoThere were two with theCubists The coming exhibitions will havepictures in several mannersa group of wood interiors where gay young thingssport the trees human and the girls wildjoyous sea pictures with cockle gatherers and bathersand one frankly symbolicOne is called Dove Grey SandsThe Face of Brooding Love in the SkyI love most those close toned ones in which he has seemed to paint the very spirit of the air to createhis subject a painted intuition of moodMost painters do no more than paint the nature of the atmosphere to give the mood of their subjectsThere seems to be in all AEs painting a sense of a living divine soul in all things that make up the universeand their unity with the soul of manFritz KreislerPianist KREISLER came and played the pianoaccompanying a young Russian baritonede WarlichIt was a lesson for all pianists and accompanistsbut of course they were not thereVery few were thereso excited are people in Chicago over musicIt was good to see how Kreisler subdued the strength of his own personality and the sound of the piano and let the boy singBut he did more than thathe subdued the authority of a great violinist and let the piano playIt would have made you glad to see how he came to the instrumentHe reached out as if he were drawing it to himwith hands and feet at Once he seemed to swing it into placeHMfor ArtH L for Artists AT a recent exhibition in the Art Institute a committee granted honorable mention to Stanislaw Szukalskithe young Polish sculptorand it is told that he tore upthe HMbefore their facesHe would undoubtedly have thrown back the thousand dollar prize to themWellwho of them all is able to give him placeBetter be free of their praise for his work if he cannot be free of their criticism for his personalityThe newspapers take it up and call him theeccentric young sculptorA citizen may be eccentric so eccentric that his fellows may The Little Review 11 shut him up in an asylumbut that s a game among themselvesHow on earth can a sculptor be eccentric It s a waste of termsOne who creates as indirectly as through Art must always seem eccentric to societybut he is not eccentric to lifehe creates as an artisthe exists as an artistPaint and Personality THE new Arts Club opened its galleries with an exhibition of Sargent and Dearth just wild enough contrast for great interestSargent resting back on old methodsexpressing himself only in his subjectsDearth vitalizing his method with feeling and creating a manner full of life stuff to express himself in his peculiar subjectsNext came an exhibitionof HenriBellowsand Sloan a matter of mennot of mannerThe courtesy with which MrHenri treats all his subjects stamps his technique and his color with that final necessary thingIn MrBellows the organization stands the testbut Bellows seems to be wantingMrSloanwith his humpy linemakes one feel a soul that has never blown out like an unfurled scrollFrederic StuckTHERE is an unintentional explanation in the German pronunciation of MrStock s name as to why the Orchestra programs nevermove onwith new music or with much variation of the old HuppdiwuppHelived on the side of a mountain near a dark pine forestHis house was built of great pine logs and the cracks were so well plastered with clay that the wind could never blow inWhen it blew very hard the little house laughed and sent the smoke gaily up the chimney which had once been a stove pipeThere was only one room in the housewith one windowbut the sun loved the little room and shone in always when the day was at its heightFriedel lived here almost alonefor his father was dead and his mother washed clothes for strangersWith the money she earned every day sheRetold from the Germanbought bread and a little butter for her boyand every year trousers or a coatbut she could not earn enough to send Friedel to schoolThis gave him no sorrowand that they were so poor had no meaning for himIn the summer he grazed his goat on the mountain side a willful goat who always sought his feed where it was steepest and always ran awaybut Friedel knew that at last he would come back and so he sat quietly by the brook which sprang zig zag down the mountain and through the thickets of slender pinesThe pines tried to catch the water but they were not quick enoughand the little stream leaped down to a great city which lay not far away in the valleyAs it dashed over the bare feet of the little boy it said Comelittle Friedelrun with merun with me and help turn the great water wheel of the millI m not so stupid as that answered Friedel I wouldn t get a penny for itBut you will wash away a few shovels of yellow clay for mewon t youOut of the clay he made all kinds of curious thingsMeckerbarthis goatand Hansthe miller s boywho always let him ride on his donkeyor even the donkey himselfAnd as he worked he thought of nothing but his workhe saw nothingheard nothing not even the blackbird singing like a fluteSo it was in the summerBut when winter came Friedel sat in the room on a chair which he had made himselfand in the stove crackled the fir wood which he had gatheredAt his feet lay Miezthe catwho was so old and lazy that she could scarcely make her spinning soundWhen the clouds would allow it the sun looked in through the window and wondered over the boy who carved such lovely thingsHe carved with a knife which had belonged to his father a knife so sharp that he could have cut both hair and beard with itIt was the day before Christmas and Friedel was working on a Wonder Beautiful horse which held one foreleg lifted and threw back his head proudlyOne would not be surprised to hear him neigh the next momentWith three feet he stood upon a smooth board on which were wheels so that he could runHe had no saddle but there was a bridlea narrow strip of brown leatherAs the sun went down Friedel s work was finished and his eyes shone with joy Now will I ride outold Miez he said will you come with me No said the cat it is too cold outside for me and this evening it will snowthen I couldn t find my way back home again when you fall off your steed The Little Review 13Do you really think I shall fall offOf course muttered the cat you have no clawswith what will you hold fast Then the mother came home from work and said Lay your knife awayFriedelHoly Evening is herewhen one must not whittle and carve or the great Mountain Chopper will come and carry you offNomotherwhen it grows dark two little angels will very softly open heaven s doorwhich is there where the sun is gone downand the Christ child will ride down to earth on a silver white horse and visit the good childrenYes said the womanand turned away to light some pine chipsthen she opened the cupboard and placed bread and butter upon the tableFriedel said very thoughtfully Why doesn t he come to usI have always been good But the mother sunk her eyes and whispered Because we are too poorThe Christ child comes only to people who have money and we have noneBut that s a shame said the little fellowAnd when his mother heard that she began to cry bitterlyFriedel sean to herput his head in her lap and said I have a big horse called Eolopdiwupp which I will sellI shall get much money for himand then the Christ child will come When he had said this he took his horse and went out of the roomhis mothercrying softlydid not watch after himand thenbecause she was so very tiredshe closed her eyes and sank into a deep sleepThe little boy opened the door very gentlyput his horse outsidegot upon it and cried Hu But the horse didn t understandhe was still too youngand besides he had a hard head and would not run If I only had a whip said Friedeland because he had none he dismounted and dragged his steed by the bridle behind himWhen the sun had gone down there rose slowly a great cloud mountainbut the greater part of the sky was still clearThere the dear moon wanderedShe shone brightly but she was no longer fullfor she had given of her light to the young stars as she rose over themIn return they let her cling to them a littlefor it is no small thing to walk there abovemuch higherthan the highest church tower and not grow dizzyIn all the air a solemn silence ruledthe dark pines stood motionlessthey held their breathas though they waited for a king to passBut the earth trembled softlyshe was freezing and she longed for a soft white covering in which she might wrap herself to sleepAt first the little boy froze toobut soon he grew warm from running and his heart beat fast with the desire to sell his precious horseAs he trotted along he met a fox Where are you goingFriedelTo sell my horseWill you have himI hear that you are a rich man and eat roast goose every dayYou should not go on footOf course not said the fox But I see what you hold there is a white horseI prefer to ride my own red brown oneOh wellpardon said Friedeland went onSoon he came upon a raven who wore a heavy black coat and called out in a deep voice TrottrotYes answered Friedel but he won t trotand alasI have no whipBut tell mewon t you buy my horseI don t want it croaked the ravenvery much hurt I have wings and can flyThat s different said Friedel I didn t know that A little farther on he came upon a sparrow and he asked again Master Greyheadyou have so much to do on the streetswon t you buy my horseYesif it were only summer said the sparrow I could make good use of himnow in winter I find it very difficult to get enough food together for my own span of horses But we will go down into the citythere it s easy to get rid of a horse like this any daySee how it shines out there with her thousand lightsComeI will guide youI must visit a few courtyards which are under my care Friedel was glad in his heartfor where could he have found a better guide or one who knew the world so well The street sloped down rapidlyThe sparrow and Friedel stepped along lightlythe horse close upon their heels Now you may see how well he can runif he only will saidFriedeland Master Greyhead said very calmly One must have much patience with such unreasonable animals They went past the water millthe great wheel had made a holiday and was standing stillso the brook had nothing to do and called out to Friedel Go back homego back homeIt is cold here outsideFlowers are gone to bedFrogs sleep deep in the mudBats hang in the cornersCuckoos sing no moreThe Little Review 15 Behind the mountain waits the windBack homego backdear childHear what he s trying to make you believe said the sparrow You mustn t give heed to himhe is one who is always coming downHe who would rise in the world must have no fears The boy intended to remember this good advice but as he saw the brightly lighted windows of the miller s house he thought Now they sit within by the warm stove having Christmas It was not long before they were in the cityThere stood high housescrowded so close together that the street could scarcely pass throughand the little fellow was afraidSometimes his mother had taken him with her to the citybut that had always been in bright dayHe had never wanted to wander about the streets alonehe would rather bewhere the leaves rustled and the birds sangNow all the windows were bright and behind the polished panes stood the loveliest thingsAlong the footpaths hurried many peopleall carrying packages and bundles under their armsFortunately there were no more wagonsso Friedel chose the streetBut even there he was not safeFirst a fat woman crossed over the wayshe carried on either side a great packpuffed like an old steam engineand gave him such a shove that he fell to the ground and his horse tooBut he stood up quickly and helped Huppdiwupp to his feet One mustn t make anything of that said the sparrow that happens everydayBut there come some dangerous fellowswe must pass them very cautiously But this didn t happenThree street urchins came along who could see more with one eye than ten men with twoThe first two seized Friedel by the jacket and the third planted himself impudently in front of the boy and said You wooden shoe felloware you taking your horse to the blacksmithYou can get it done cheaper herewe ll shoe him for nothingThat s not necessary said Friedel I wish to sell him Then the three shouted and the boldest one began to talk again Listenyouyou can t sell your horsewe won t have itGive it to me and I won t tell that you stole it And then he reached out for the bridle and tried to snatch away from the boy the only thing that he ownedThen the sparrow whispered Take off your wooden shoe and give him one on the head Friedel thought this good advice and followed itThere began a great battleand even though there were three of the others they lacked a weapon and got many blowsPerhaps it might have gone badly with the boy at the endbut like thunder and lightning a man came between themHe had a polished helmet on his head and a sword at his sideunder his nose he wore an enormous mustache which always trembled as though in fear of the frightful words that flew past itHe shouted Separateyou boyskeep the peace or I ll pepper and salt your backsWho started thisHe cried the threeas one mouth Nothey peeped the sparrowbut no one heard him You seeWatch Masterhe still has his wooden shoe in his hand said the boldest onehe attacked us with thatBe silent thundered the man we ll get the right of thisYouput on your shoeand tell me what you want here in the street with the horseHe has stolen the horse said one of the boys No said Friedelvery boldly and clearly the horse belongs to meI made it myself The man couldn t well believe that and said That s very suspiciousFollow mewe ll soon find out So Friedel had to follow him and the bad boys exultedThey gave a howl of joy and started afterbut he with the helmet motioned toward his sword and they gladly ran awayThe man stalked ahead while Friedelthe sparrowand Huppdiwupp followed as fast as their legs would carry themThe poor little fellow was very disheartened and thought it a bad adventureBut the sparrow whispered to him This is nothingI can manage it At the next corner he gave Friedel a sign and they swung to the rightunnoticedwhile the man of law went straight aheadseeing nothingintent only on his own steps That s the way to manage such people said the sparrow You must never follow their orders if you wish to be a clever fellowBut waitHere we are at the right placeIn this old house lives a merchant who deals in cats and dogsdonkeys and horsesTake a lookhis window is full of themGo in and try your luck The small boy opened the doorwent into the shopand asked the merchant Here is my horse HuppdiwuppI want very much to sell himWill you take himWhy not said the merchant What does he cost A thousand thalerThat s too dear for me said the merchantand made a very thoughtful face Just lookmy horses are much handsomer than yours and even then much cheaper than a thousand thalerYes said Friedel I believe thatBut your horses are dead and The Little Review 17 mine is aliveI should knowI made it myselfBut tell mewhat will you give meHalf a pfennigThat s much too little said the boy and went quickly out the doorHuppdiwupp sprang over the thresholdas enraged as heLittle Greyhead was much annoyed when he heard the story and peeped very distinctly Such a common fellowIt s a pity I didn t go in with youso that I could have given him a piece of mymindBut waitSee that strange fellow coming thereNotice how his spider legs bend under himHis body is so thin that he throws no shadowand his face looks as though it were plastered with copper moneyAsk himhe is surely a horsemanI tell you the beat horse deals are always made in the street Friedel waited until the man came up and then saidvery shyly Dear Sirwon t you buy my little horse My mother and I have no money But the man merely said Beggar and passed onleaving the three not knowing what to do Don t cry said the sparrowwho recovered quickest that s the way with peopleI know them from my grain dealsI m not crying said Friedel bravelybut he was as sad at heart as a horse who has won a race and waits in vain for his rider to pat his neck I shall stay no longer in the cityand I shall have nothing more to do withthese peopleI know very well what I must doTell meMaster Greyheadhave you already seen the Christ child this eveningTo be sureI see him every yearToday he came riding in from the door of the East and he will go out again at the West doorIf you wish to speak with him we must hurry and reach the bench by the spring where he will surely pass And now the three went together out of the cityThere was no one to be seen and Friedel s wooden shoes made klappklapp on the hard frozen roadHe pulled his fur cap down over his earsbecause he was so coldand thrust his hands into his trousers pockets Shall I lend you my handkerchiefMaster Greyhead he asked Out of it you can make some stockings for your bare legs But the sparrow laughed Never mindeven in winter my feet are quite comfortableNow look about you this is the placeSit down on the bench and restbut take care not to go to sleepMeanwhile I ll watch and tell you when the Christ child comesThe little fellow sat downand the sky grew darker and darkerThe stars put out their lights and the moon disappearedThen it seemed to Friedel that the world grew stillerand he himself grew wearierand soon there came fluttering down through the airvery softlythousands and thousands of butterfliesThey settled on the bare branches of the treesand when there was no more room therethey sank down on the road and the groundcovering the whole earth They have woven a white cloth said the sparrow that is really too badBut what can one doThe Christ child has given away his horse and stockings and shoes and must not walk on the bare groundSeethere he comes Great heavensFriedel had fallen asleepBut he had to open his eyes againHe saw a shimmering light coming nearer and nearerThen Friedel stood up and walking was so easy for himso wonderfully easythat he moved toward the lightAt last came an angel s child with long hair and a bluerobewith nothing in his handswho went with bare feet and stepped so lightly that not a trace of him remained in the snowAll the light which Friedel had seen came from his two eyesand about his mouth played a smile as though the Mother Maria had just kissed his lips Are you the Christ child asked Friedel Yes answered heand looked so long at Friedel that a strange warmth ran through the boy s whole bodyThen the little fellow took heart and asked fervently Dear Christ childpeople will have nothing to do with me and no one sees my needBuy my little horse HuppdiwuppI have carved him with my own handYou cannot go back to heaven on footYou can pay me what you willOh said the Christ child I have no money Friedel was astonished No moneyAnd yet you bring such lovely things to the childrenEvery year you ve gone to the rich millerof course you have never known where we poor people liveYealittle boy said the Christ child and smiled so strangely How that comes to be I cannot sayAnd then you are not poorBut mother says soGive me your handDid you carve that beautiful horse with this handYesThere is a gift in your hand said the Christ child which a rich man cannot buy for a whole sack of gold and he stroked his hand and blessed himBut Friedel was not content and pleaded Haven t you one more nut in your pocket or at least a gig or a cakeThen the Christ child said sadly I really didn t think of you and I have given everything awayBut if you will lend your little horse HuppThe Little Review 19 diwupp to methen you shall see a lovelier Christmas tree than any child on earth has owned tonight Friedel was satisfiedThe Christ child seated himself on the horsetook the little boy in his armsand before thembetween the ears of the horseMaster Greyhead perched himselfAnd now it was wonderful to see how the horse grew larger and largerIt was as if wings grew to himand he rose slowly up and left the earth beneathIt snowed no morethe sky had become clear againand the stars gleamed like diamonds in the dark hair of a queenAnd as they kept rising steadily higher and higher the heart of the boy rose tooIt was wide with joybut it was strange that he could not feel it beatingHis body was so light that he felt he could jump to the starshe could not feel when his foot touched the neck of the horseBut he thought no more of this for he was so happyhis own work was bearing him up to the highest placesFar below he saw meadows and forests which shone whitely uptheretoowere the mountains and the cliffs stretching up like giants and yet unable to reach himFrom the distance the bells toned very softly as if their clapperswere wound round with velvetThey were calling to Holy FestivalFriedel flew higher and higher and the earth grew as small as the wheel of the water milland even smallerFinally they went past the moon who was polishing her lamp which had almost gone outShe nodded to Friedel very kindly BravoYou ll soon be able to fly yourself And then they came into heavena place so splendid that one cannot tell of itThere stood a great palace of transparent blue crystalin it was a hall with walls of white marble and a table which gleamed like a single diamondUpon this table was a green pine tree and on it hung a thousand starsfive hundred of them burned with a quiet lightthe other five hundred glittered and flamedlike children of the sun Is it not lordlyMaster Sparrow asked the boyThe other answered Yesbut a full cherry tree with the fruit showing dark red through the green I do not know but what I shouldprefer that Then the Christ child led them to the tablefor under the pine treein a very simple arm chairsat the dear GodHe was stone old but he looked about him as kindly as a father looks at his childrenUpon his left knee he rocked a little angel who sang Ahdear God said Friedel very shyly now that I am up here I should like so much to see my father againI believe he is not here said the Christ child He has gone to another place because he scolded and beat your motherOh said Friedel that doesn t make any differenceMother has often beaten mebut I love her just the sameThat s very different said the Christ childand the dear God smiled a very littleFriedel was near to tears but he took heart and said Seedear GodI have brought a beautiful horse with meHis name is HuppdiwuppHe is withoutbefore the doorfor it is too slippery for him in hereas he has no iron hoofsBut he is no common horseHe has brought us all up to heavenThe people would not buy my horseThey did not know what he was worthThe Christ child has no moneyso you take it and give me for him what I beg you And as Friedel finished the dear God set the little angel on the floor and it tripped awayThen he stretched out his right hand and drew the little boy toward himand Friedel knew that he was to receive his wishAt ten o clock a lusty fellow knocked at the window of Friedel s mother Wash Margaretget upIt s Ithe miller s HansI found your youngster down below by the fountain almost frozen to ice How frightened the mother wasBut she rubbed her little boy with snow and he grew slowly warm againShe held him the whole night through and kept saying My poor boyMy poor boy But Friedel stammeredsleepy and snow drunk I am not poorI can make the Christ Child out of snow white stone and he will shine like the sun The poor woman did not know what to say but she clasped her child with both arras to keep him warmfor outside the wind had risen and was slashing the roofFinally they both fell asleepmother and sonand at their right stood Need and at their left stood Sorrowwatching over themFor these are the angels of the poorand whom they lift up they make the ConquerorsThe Little Review 21 The Reader CriticMutable EmotionsAlan Adair Fovant CampYesterday your paper came to mesent forward from my homeFor the last four months it has come to me through change of camp and bulletsthe delays of censorshipand the uncertainties of civil andmilitary postsAnd each time it has provoked meand tonightas I read it in the flickering obscurity of my hutit provokes me excessivelyFor I am a soldier and my life is the immemorial life of soldiersThat is to say it is the life of a barbarianof an antique legionaryof a serf of the Middle Age6f those that fought before the Arts were born of leisure and the life of citiesI am a soldier and live according to the ancient lore of campsincessant occupation and equally unceasing tediumrecurring orgies of physical exertion prolonged to the verge of utter exhaustionan inexorable discipline that is with classic exactness termed blindthe constant and elementary hardships of animal existence experienced in forms unmitigated by any of the devices of civilizationabove alla complete and almost splendid intellectual vacuitya complete and almost splendid indifference to the customary enthusiasms and inclinations of a life outside the armiesthese are the chief elements that shape the life of a soldier on active service and these are the influences amongst whichthroughout Europethe men of my years are coming to maturityThat is why you provoke me and your paper provokes meand your contributors all provoke me when there is talk of the ArtsOur experiences are alien to each otherand Art is so completely a matter for man s inner soulfor that inner soul wherein distil to essence the laborssufferings and lusts of a man s life and from which the deepest elements of individual character take form and colorAs your quotation from de Gourmont puts itthere is a difference in our sensibilityand that difference lies in thisthat we in Europe are soldiersThe other influences that separate us in sympathy are negligibleand spring solely from our different opportunities of acquaintance with the cultsand works of contemporary schools and artistsBut the military influence has turned the city of Art to a tower of Babel We who are soldiers no longer understand the tongues that Art once spoketo usThe old language of unrestof delicate eclecticismof an indecision of taste that hungers by turn for the remotely archaic and the fantastically modernis become unintelligible to us who amid the discipline and adventures of arms are learning new values for all the sacraments of lifeIn a Phillistine worldwhere money was a god indecently obtruded and death a presence solicitously hiddenit was well enough to seek among the Arts for spells to dissipate realityWith life secure in our hands and without imperative 22 The Little Review desires in our hearts it was reasonableto find in contemplation of the creations of man s love of beautya satisfaction of the many dissatisfactions of the spiritBut when a man has seen deathvery clear and hugestraddling the wayand learned to think patiently of the final extinctionlost many friendsmet fear in twenty shapesand in the light of an unhoped for morning felt the freshunshattered joy of livingthe Artsif they do not lose influencedo at least change in the significance that they have for his soulThey become not a means for satisfying the inexpressible and vacillating impulses of the spiritbut a means of satisfying the desires of a whole manTo have lived and survived as a soldier teaches a man the worth of his lifeand life is desireTo live fully is to desire much and to have found means for the satisfaction of one s desiresArt as you speak of itas you advertise for itis not a thing to minister to the desires of a manIt is a coloring matter to conceal an anaemia of the spirita way of spinning dainty webs across the void of a purposeless existenceAt the best it is an echo for awakening the senses to the mysteries and subtleties of lifebut without power to interpret them into actionI suspectit is merely a device to avoid boredomBut for uswith lives still in hazardthe world holds too many desirable things for our souls to feel need of an art of this kindArt for us is no longer a means for the evocation of emotiona magic net cast over all the nude and undesirable body of life We are too full of lusts for such an art We are done withthe brooding East with the Tagoreswith the Ajanta caveswith the dun yellows and faded crimsons of Hindustan We know ourselves again to be of the European traditionthe tradition of men who think and actOur art must servelifewhich is to say it must serve our wills and desiresFor we desire multitudinous thingslovestravels and insurrectionsWe have lived too long as mud in the hands of chance and a military systemEvery fibre of body and soul is athirst We desire womenhorses and dogsand wines We desire adventures that are adventures of the spirit and not solely a hazard of blood and health We desire a society reshaped and to be concerned in that inflaming and organization of the people that alone can precipitate so vast a changeWe areready to turn again to our old purposesto that large movement that will control the fate of all existing polities and is called Syndicalismthe new UnionismIndustrial UnionismAnarchy as latitude or language altersto our intentions in IrelandCataloniaor among the broken nations of the Slavsto the fantastic keenness of a sculpture and a painting become militant and seeking ever further into the reality of man s consciousness and semblanceBut we return to these enthusiasms disciplined by unaccustomed rigors We have learned to live directlyto think clearlyto act and have doubtsHenceforwardfor us Art will be a thing of clear outlinessimplicityarm practical purposeIt must administer to our desiresIt must be part of our willthat is of pur philosophy and lustIt must be evangelistIt must carry a sword in its cloak We shall have no use for the Imagist telling three lines of the passage of some faint tremor of joy or repugnanceNor shall we applaud the Vorticist poet jerking in angular words a cinematograph picture across the mindWe want a verse with The Little Review 23 blood in itWe want verse in a hundred manners aphrodisiac or insurrectionarymournfulobsceneor profoundOnly we want a verse that is not trivial and is not coldSimilarly we want plays and essays and talesBut we want a drama that is less a drama of discussion than one of actionessays that are shaped to a purposestories that show life untrulyvenomousunfaireloquent tales that inflamethat espouse and condemn We want an art inspired by a love of action We want an art that is the evocation of sustained and coherent desire We want an art astir with the conscious movement of a soul that willsan art of purposes and lustsFor wehave ventured our lives and received them back invigorated by dangerwe have learned in hardships the value of desire and through endurance have discovered how contemptible is an art of delicate and unsure pleasuresof dilettantismof variedsterileand mutable emotionsAnd such is the Art of your contributors and such the definition of Art that even the blank pages of your paper imply This is so beautiful an expression of the typical confusions about Art that I scarcely know where to begin to answer itIn the first placeyou say that the life of war is an artificial life a Philistine worldThen why talk about wanting Art in such a worldArt and Philistinism have never mixedIn the second placewhy did you need to go to war to learn to live directlyto think clearlyto act and have no doubtsThe artist never has life secure in his handshe always has an imperative desire in his heartand he is alwaysseeing deathvery clear and hugestraddling the way alwaysthinking of the final extinction alwayslosing many friendsmeeting fear in twenty shapesand feeling the fresh unshattered joy of living If going to war did these things to youthen you simply confess that it took war toquickenyoubut the artists is bornquickened And now that you wish to react against somethingafter the quickeningyou complain that Art will not receive your reactionWhy on earth do you insist on going to Art for all those things you wantIf you want blood and lustgo on fightingIf you want meateat meatdon t try to eat Art Wh o ever imagined that Art administers to men s desiresWhen Bernhardt acts for the French soldiersare theytoo full of lusts for such an Artor does she change her immortal Art to meet their desires forwomenhorses and dogsand wine You say that Art for you is no longer a means for the evocation of emotionRemember that the evocation of emotion has never been a test of Artany more than Art has beena magic net cast over all the nude and undesirable body of lifeora spell to dissipate reality Life serves lifeArt doesn t do thatArt will never be part of your willit is the artist s willYour philosophy and lust can be served by the claims of philosophy and lustWhat you call your Art need will be served by Artbut only when you have fulfilled your part of the bargain since you are not a creator your will must go toward appreciation orfirsttoward the capacity for appreciationMCA 24 The Little Review Growing Pains Stephan BochlinDenverI did enjoy the Greek sketches by Richard AldingtonSome of them are very beautifulthe firstfourthand sixteenth especially soI am glad that a few of our writers are beginning to see the capacities of what Baudelaire callspoetic prose And there is one articlePaderewski and Tagorewhich gave me much pleasureIt is an excellent study in contrastsA score or so of such impressions would be well worth publishing in a more permanent formThe rest of this issue left me cold if I may be pardoned for possessing standards as exacting asif somewhat different fromyoursBut this is only saying that nine tenths of what passes asartin America leaves me coldand on this I suspect you would heartily agree with meI should dearly love toopen a discussion with you onart Your viewsas you expressed them hereinterested me greatlyand also tantalized meI had the feeling that you were eternally trying to catch a flame between your handsa flame that eternally eluded youor burned you into silenceYou left me wondering whether there was any value in trying to perform this featand as I have already told youI felt that you were nearest tounderstandingart when you were burned into silenceAs for meI have noviewsat allSometimes I write something a linea phrasethat seems made to live foreverFor lack of any other word I call the resultart But I do not know why it isart and I am a little afraid that if I try to find out I shall lose the giftsuch as it isIt is something like the Medusa headone cannot look upon it direct without being frozen into stone orwhat is worseinto dogmaYou are very fond of the wordmiracle Your highest praise for anything is to say of it It has the miracle But tell meis it not in the very nature of a miracle that we cannot tell in what way or how it will come about let alone trying to determine within what fixed conditions it ought to come aboutperhaps I am mistakenbut it has seemed to me that you havein your magazinefrequently taken the stand that thismiraclehas certain fixed qualitieswhich must be recognized by allAnd my own personal feeling is that there are as many kinds of miracles as there are faithsand that every faith whatsoever can produce amiraclewhich is anything but art isindeedthe rankest form of fanaticism or superstition to the holders of an opposite beliefYou understandof coursethat I am not speaking ex cathedraI so much dislike tomake a circlearound my ideasespecially when it is a question of things as little understood as the reasons for our belief in immortality or in beautyWe seek the beautiful when our sense of the tragic in life becomes too keentoo poignanttoo unendurablewe wish to escape from this bitter and sardonic realizationto falsify it somehowto invest it with qualities that have no existence beyond our own mindsAnd the result each after his own fashion is beautyThe Little Review 25 Butart Wellone might say that this ceaseless falsification of life through the escape into Beauty becomes Art when it compels all men or all those men who act as the interpreters of life to look upon reality and to see thereas though it had always been thereawaiting our attention through the agesjust that one particular type of Beauty How strange that we could not see it before menwill cryaftersome great artist has performed amiraclethrough his passionate sensitiveness to the spirit of Tragedy And sowe rediscover the meaning of Art But I said that I had noviewsand I immediately give myself the lieI have views one mustI supposewhen one deeply believes in anythingLet my genuine interest in your efforts to find a needle in this haystack of American culture philistinism serve me as a partial buffer against your impatience with my ideas What do you mean by Beautythe idea that education puts upon the minds of peoplemeaning lovelypleasing to the senses and the emotionsThat isn t Artit is not necessarily a feature but may be aninstrumentof ArtWhat of real Beautywhich surpasses the spirit of joy or tragedyIt may betoo keentoo poignanttoo unendurablefor the mindbut the soul claims it alwaysThe artist does not falsify or interpret lifehe creates with joyeven if the joy in the creating is the surplus of his agonyjh The Blindness of the Social Vision Louis PuteklisCambridgeMass When I looked on the empty pages of your September issuetwo important questions arosealong with many minor onesNot having the time to go into details I will ask one questionWhat is your definition of artYou say Art for Art s sake that is only a phraseBut in this world people have different understandings of artwhat is beautiful for one is ugly for anotherWhat is praised by the capitalist class with its religious atmosphere is despised by the proletarian clasps with its progressive atheismWhat is a picture of ah angel to an atheistSuch a product of an artist s imaginationwhich perpetuates religious humbugis to be condemned without hesitationWhat is a poem about the Virgin worth to a class conscious worker if his own daughter or sister is slaving in the sweat shopis ever in all kinds of danger and temptations under this glorious capitalistic systemSo we cannot sayArt for Art s sake until we know what is meant by ArtMoreovernobody fell down from heaven a master artist We shall teach and train them with patienceand not withscolding Why is there no encouraging editorial on ArtThirteen empty pages and not a word from the pen of the Art sick EditorWhy was not the whole magazine a blankor is only half of it to be devoted to artWhat was the ideafor Art s sakein printing the frivolouscaricatures of the EditorHer ways of spending her leisure moments have scarcely enough of the universal to stimulate the artistic na26 The Little Review ture of the readersI am gladof coursethat she has fudge for breakfastbut I am sorry for the thousands that go without breadHunger does not produce art nor does upbraidingIn looking over the pictures I should judge that in comparison with others the Editor must be placed among the fortunate onesthe unhappiness she lays claim to must come from within her own natureAgainfor whom is The Little Review publishedFor artists onlyor for all peopleI must admit that since I have known The Little Review for more than a year it has not always been artisticmany articles have been artificial onlyfor the simple reason that there are not enough real artists in the country to support such a venture And as for the general run of readersthey want storiesthatwhether artistic or nothave the ring of real life in themThere can be no art without social visionand without definite ideas progressive or retrogressiveIf The Little Review takes both of the waysit can satisfy no class of readersArt has ever been the handmaid of oppression and superstitioneven more than of progressthe churchby musicarchitectureoratoryand pictures has held the minds of men enthralledIt is sad to think how artists in the past have used their energies to perpetuate dreamy imaginationsthings non existentIt is painful to see the artists doing the same thing nowThe free human intellect must and will develop the most beautiful art there has ever beenbut not for Art s sakefor truth s sake and for humanity s sakeAnd if The Little Review will take one of the wayslet her take the progressive oneI appeal to the Editor s Art sick heart to make more definite her policyto look less on the empty form and more on the animating truth which agrees with reality and lifeLife is shortDon t call on the artists already in the gravebut encourage the genius that lives now and may soon disappear without a chanceof development and self expressionBe sincere and please don t poseDon t put Art in a frame and don tframe upartists What is this you re telling us about ArtThe greatest and freest human intellects in the past have never created ArtIntellects do not have aesthetic experiences You might as well ask a gas engine to run a human being instead of that indefinable force called life The dreamersthe ones of imaginationhave the whole visionthe outside and the insideand the vision of the two working together with all thingsWhy do you want to limit them to one the social visionYou say that Art has always been the handmaiden of oppression and superstitionthat the Church has used all forms of Art to hold men to itTrueLet mesalute the far seeing and mighty wisdom of the Catholic Church that has so recognized the power of ArtIf you who are trying to extend the social vision could learn that one lessonwhat a strength you could add unto yourselvesthe only strengthYou sayLook less on the empty form and more on the animating truth which agrees with reality and life Form is the only thing that remains

Blast had among its veins of gold ore and volcanic deposit a certain precious spot American Art When It Appears Will be Immense That is the way I feel about Sherwood Anderson s Art as revealed in his first novelWindy McPherson s SonHere is the beginning of our story telling artprimitiveto be surecoarsebut a quiver with that life whose pulsing reality we are forever eager to touchto knowSherwood s hero is the typically primitive hero a brother to Aggamemnon and Charlemagnethe born leaderthe maker of destiniesBut Sam McPherson s background is not the helmet plumes of the knights or the nodding heads of the Council of EldersHe is of our timeof our own middle Westwith our well known background of nodding corn tassels and steer fattening farmerswith our stinkingdeafening Chicago for a battlegroundFor he fightsfuriouslyandlike Achillesfor the love of fightingbut notlike Achilleswith the lives of menbut with their potential lives foodstuffs with their timeand their peace of mindtheir happinesstheir everything summed up in moneyAndfor the love of the fight he winsAnd thenbecause he is a white American with twenty centuries of Christianity behind him and not a pagan Aggamemnon to be satisfied with the mere winninghe turns aside from his victory and goes seeking an idealSo there is our herothe forever worshiped Konig manBut Sam McPherson is not the glorious part of the bookor the reason that ourgrandchildrenand probably our great great grandchildren will still keep Windy McPherson s Son as living wordsSherwood Anderson has dredged up from the mud of our prairies the same apaling rhythm of life that AEschylus found in the stone of the AcropolisAnd even as Aeschylus built his rhythm in cedar wood and overlaid it with ivory and gold and polished marble and carved it and set it with jewels balancing his ornaments to the nicety of a hairand so finished his symphony to please the blue and white spirit of Hellasso Sherwood Anderson has taken his discoveryre built its same rhythmic proportions and scooping up grey gravel and sand and concrete rocks from his own prairie has built his symphonyWill we see the wonder of its form in spite of its grey surfaceCan we feel the forcethe genuineness of Sherwood s discoveryCan we see the bareness of American reality and yet shut our eyes to that reality Ohthen this Anderson is a realist you say We re getting tired of them Nohe is not a realistHe does not cypher as the realists doadding and subtracting cause and effects to reach a hypothetical absoluteSherwood Anderson is a primitivereflecting the immense movements of
