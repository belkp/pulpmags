GermIN 1850 an astounding thing hap pened in EnglandA little group of artists and poetsknown as the Pre Raphaelite Brotherhoodbegan the publication of a magazineIt was to be given over tothoughts towards nature in poetryliteratureand art and it was called The GermThe idea was Dante Gabriel Rossetti swho was then just twenty two years oldThomas Woollierof the same ageand Holman Hunt and Millaisboth somewhere in the neighborhood of twentywere dragged willingly into the planWilliam Michael Rossettiaged nineteenwas made editorJames Collinson and Frederick George Stephens were added to the four original PRBsJohn Lucas TupperFord Madox BrownWalter Howell DeverellWilliam Cave ThomasJohn Hancockand Coventry Patmore were intimately connected with the projectand Christinathen eighteenoffered her poems for publication thereinThe Germ was published for four monthsand then it diedLike all serious things it could find no immediate audiencelike all revolutionary things it was called juvenile and regarded with shynessand like all original and beautiful things it has managed to stay very much aliveForin 1899a limited edition of The Germ in facsimile was brought outand William Michael Rossetti wrote an extensive introduction for it in which he described minutely the whole glorious undertakingIt is these facsimiles that we have been looking through with such aweand which tell such an interesting storyHere was a league ofunquiet and ambitious young spiritsbent upon making a fresh start of their ownand a clean sweep of some effete respectabilities On the night of December 191849when the first issue of the magazine was impendingthey met in Dante Rossetti s studio at 72 Newman Street to discuss a change of titleThe PRBJournal and Thoughts Towards Naturetheextra peculiarsuggestion of Danteaccording to his brotherhad been discardedand MrCave Thomas had drawn up a list of sixty five possibilitiesamong them The SeedThe ScrollThe HarbingerFirst ThoughtsThe SowerThe Truth SeekerThe Acornand The GermThe last was decided upon and the first issue came out about the first of JanuarySeven hundred copies were printed and about two hundred soldThis wasn t encouragingso the second issue was limited to five hundredbut it sold even less well than the firstand the PRBs were at the end of their resourcesThen the printing firm came to the rescue and undertook the responsibility of two more numbersThe title was changed to Art and Poetrybeing Thoughts towards Natureconducted principally by Artistsbutall Copyright1914by Margaret CAndersonThe Little efforts proved uselessPeople would not buy The Germand would scarcely consent to know of its existenceSo the magazine breathed its lastand its obsequies were conducted in the strictest privacy It did attract some critical attentionhoweverThe Critic wrote We cannot contemplate this young and rising school in art and literature without the most ardent anticipation of something great to grow from itsomething new and worthy of our ageand we bid them godspeed upon the path they have adventured Others remarked that the poetry in The Germ was all beautiful marred by not a few affectations the genuine metalbut wanting to be purified from its dross much of it of extraordinary meritand equal to anything that any of our known poets could writesave Tennyson Well the situation demands a philosopherWe might undertake the rôle ourselvesexcept that we re too near the situationhaving just started a magazine with certain high hopes of our ownOn the cover of each issue of The Germ appeared this poem by William Rossettithe mastery of whichsome one saidwould require a Browning Society s united intellectsWhen whoso merely hath a little thoughtWill plainly think the thought which is in him Not imaging another s bright or dimNot mangling with new words what others taught When whoso speaksfrom having either sought Or only found will speaknot just to skim A shallow surface with words made and trimBut in that very speech the matter broughtBe not too keen to crySo this is allA thing I might myself have thought as wellBut would not say itfor it was not worth Ask Is this truth For is it still to tell That be the theme a point or the whole earthTruth is a circleperfectgreat or smallReview Patmore s The SeasonsChristina Rossetti s Dream LandDante s My Sister s Sleep and Hand and SoulWoolner s My Beautiful Lady and Of My Lady in DeathTupper s The Subject in ArtWilliam Rossetti s Her First Seasonand a long review of Clough s Bothic of Toper na fuosich make up the first numberIn the others are The Blessed DamozelChristina s An End and A Pause of ThoughtPatmore s Stars and MoonJohn Orchard s Dialogue on Artand many other things of valueconcluding with a review of Browning s Christmas Eve and Easter Dayin which William Rossetti establishes with elaborate seriousnessthrough six pages of solemn and awesome sentencesthat Browning s style is copious and certainly not other than appropriate that if you will understand himyou shallAll this came to our mind the other day when some one accused us of beingjuvenile What hideous stigma was thereby put upon usThe only grievous thing about juvenility is its unwillingness to be frank it usually tries to appear veryvery old and veryvery wiseThe Germ was quite frankly youngotherwise it could not have been so full of death poetryfor it is youth s most natural affectation to steep itself in deathBut The Germ might have been even morejuvenileand so avoided some of the heavysumptuous sentences in that Browning reviewIt would have gained in readableness without any possible sacrifice of beauty or truthIn their poetry the Pre Raphaelites were as simple and spontaneous as children in their criticism they were rhetoricalOur sympathy is somehow very strongly with the spontaneity whatever dark juvenile crimes it may be guilty of in the eyes of those who merely look but do not seeThe Little Review Rebellion

worth And burst all cages M a n and Superman GEORGE BURMAN FOSTER HIS voluptuous vagabondage Rousseau at length halted at Pariswhere he managed to worry through some inconstant yearsThe thing that saved the day for him was the fragment of a pamphlet that blew across his path in one of his ramblesannouncing a prize to be awarded by the Academy of Dijon for the best answer to an extraordinary questionHad the renascence of the arts and sciences ennobled moralsThat was a flash of lightning which lit up a murky night and helped this bewildered and lonely wanderer to get his bearingsThoughts came to him demoniacally which shaped his entire future and won him no small place in the history of humanityAnswer is No said RousseauAnd his answer was awarded the academic prizeIt seems strange that the history of his times sided with Rousseau s No Certainly it was the first fiery meteor The Little of the French revolutionIt pronounced the first damnatory sentence upon a culture that had already reached the point of collapseIn his own body and soul Rousseau had bitterly experienced the curse of this cultureIt was largely responsible for his heart s abnormal yearning whose glow was consuming himInstead of ennobling morals this culture had inwardly barbarized manThen it galvanized and painted the outside of lifeAnd then life became a glittering lieThus Rousseau became prophet in this desert of cultureand called men to repentanceBack from culture to nature was his radical cryback from what man has made out of himself to what nature meant him to beNature gave man free use of his limbs culture has bound them with all sorts of bindingsuntil he is stiffand short windedand crippledAccording to nature man lives his own lifeman is what he seems and seems what he is according to culture he is cunningand craftyand mendaciousThe eighteenth century man of culture hearkened with attentive soul to the dirge in which one of its noblest sons vented his tortured heartThe melancholy music bruised from this prophet s heart silenced the wit and ridicule of even a Voltairewho wanted to knowhoweverwhetherthe idea was that man was to go on all fours again In a few decades the feet of revolutionary Frenchmen were at the door readywith few and short prayersto bear to its last abode that culture whose moral worth even a French Academy had called in questionand for whose moral condemnation had awarded the first prizeNow it is our turn What is the good of our cultureSuch is the query of a host of people who know nothing Review thereof save the wounds it has inflicted upon them a host of people who face our culture with the bitter feeling that they have created it with the sweat of their browsbut have not been permitted to taste its joysSuchtoois the query of others

our techniqueHas he not heard his crack spellbinder orate on the The Little Review cultural felicity that follows our flagDown with the disloyalty of highbrow doubters Now it was from an entirely different sideindeed it was from an entirely different standpointthat Friedrich Nietzsche contemplated modern cultureparticularly the national culture of the German FatherlandWhat horrified him was not simply the contentbut the criterionof our cultureHe sharply scrutinized the ideals which we set ourselves in our cultureHe found not simply our achievements but our idealsourselves evenso inferiorso vulgarso contemptiblethat he began to doubt whether even the Germans could be recognized as a culture people or notHence Nietzsche became the most ruthless iconoclast of our cultureUnlike the majorityunlike the scholarsthe philanthropiststhe philistinesNietzsche was not moved by the misery of the massesby the great social need of our timeHe did not regret that the boon of our culture was shared by so fewinasmuch asin his opinionthis boon was of very doubtful valueHe found our life so barbarousso culture hostilethat he still missed the first elements of a true culture among usHence Nietzsche lunged against status quoHe did what he himself calledunzeitmassig untimelyHe flung a questionmore burning than any otherinto our time more burning than even the social questionconstituting indeed the main part of that questionIt was the question as to how man fared in this culture the question as to what man got out of it and as to what it got out of manNever before had this question been put as Nietzsche put itWe should recall that Nietzsche was not one of those who had experienced the extremes of either plenty or wantnor was he one of those who filled the wide space between the twoT o himthe pessimism of the discontented and the optimism of the fortunate and the satisfied were alike superficialif not impertinentIt was not a question of happiness at allIn bitterbiting sarcasm he sayswith reference to the English utilitarianhappiness morality I do not seek my happiness only an Englishman seeks his happinessI seek my work No his was a question which his conscience put to cultureWas it a culture of the earthor of manHere Nietzsche probes homeAnd he alone did itThe most diverse censors of our time had not seen and said that no matter how desirableno matter how gloriously conceived the new order of things might beman must be the decisive thingman must tip the scalesIt was this that went against the grainMightier machineslarger citiesbetter apartmentsbigger schoolswhat was the good of it allet id omne genusif new and greater men did not ariseSo said NietzscheAnd he said it with high scorn to a generation which had forgotten that man is not forculture but culture for manof manby manfor manEvery people seems to pass through a period in which it is obsessed with the idea that the causes of popular prosperity are at once motive and criterion of culture that the natural laws of economics are the universally valid norms of the ebb and flow of human values that a balance on the balance sheet to the goodthe satisfactoriness of the statistics of exports and import s to the wishes of the interested partiesare an occasion for jubilation over the ascent which life has compassedHarbor some scruple as to whether the jubilation be warranted or The Little

valid in the world of quantitynot of qualityof possessionnot of beingof tax tablesnot of human essence and human powerNow all men are equalBut Nietzsche knew that if men are equal they are not freeif

is something you with a gasping sense of having been absolutely newabsolutely authenticswept through the skiesand also with something so full of vision and truth that feeling of new life which comes with that it s like getting to the top of a a plunge into colddeep seasAngel mountain for the sunriseIts freshness Island is a new kind of Winged Victoryand its clearness are like cool morning Innumerable books have been written mists that the sun has shot throughabout the conflict of the sexesabout the But to discard vague phrases and get emergence of the new womanMost of to the story for it is not a tractbut them are dull booksBut MrsGill a novel or rather a poetic allegory 10 The Little that MrsGillmore has writtenFive men of representative modern types a professora libertinea soldier of fortuneamere mutt man and an artist are shipwrecked on a tropical islandAfter a few days their attention is caught by what appears to be huge birds flying through the heavensThe birds come nearer and prove to be winged women Then comes the story of their wooingtheir capturetheir ultimate evolution into what modern women have decided they want to behumanistsHoweverthis is going too fastThe only way to appreciate Angel Island is to be conscious of the art of it as you readBeginning with the shipwreckMrsGillmore creates a series of brilliant pictures that culminate in the flying orgies of the bird womenAll this was intensified by the anarchy of sea and skyby the incessant explosion of the wavesby the wind which seemed to sweep from end to end of a liquefying universeby a downpour which threatened to beat their sodden bodies to pulpby all the connotation of terror that lay in the darkness and in their unguarded condition on a barbaroussemi tropical coastThe stormwhich had seemed to worry the whole universe in its griphad died finally but it had died hardOn a quieted earththe sea alone showed signs of revolutionThe wavesmonstroustoweringswollenwere still marching on to the beach with a machine like regularity that was swift and ponderous at the same timeBeyond the wave lineunder a cover of foamthe jaded sea lay feebly palpitant like an old man asleepThey had watched the sun come up over the trees at their backAnd it was as if they had seen a sunrise for the first time in their livesTo them it was neither beautiful nor familiarit was sinister and strangeA chillthat was not of the dawn but of death itselflay over everythingThe morning wind was the breath of the tombthe smells that came to them from the island bore the taint of mortalitythe very sun seemed icyThey suffered the five survivors of the night s tragedy with a scarify Review ing sense of disillusion with NatureThe sun was racing up a sky smooth and clear as gray glassIt dropped on the torn green sea a shimmer that was almost dazzlingbut there was something incongruous about that as though Nature had covered her victim with a spangled scarfIt brought out millions of sparkles in the white sandand there seemed something calculating about that as though she were bribing them with jewels to forgetDozens of waves flashed and crashed their way up the beachbut now they trailed an iridescent network of foam over the lilac gray sandThe sun raced high but now it poured a flood of light on the green gray waterThe air grew bright and brighterThe earth grew warm and warmerBlue came into the skydeepened and the sea reflected itSuddenly the world was one huge glittering bubblehalf of which was the brilliant azure sky and half the burnished azure seaAll this is gorgeous enough this clearvivid painting of natureBut when MrsGillmore turns her hand to the supernaturalshe is simply ravishingFor instanceThe semi tropical moon was at its fullHugewhiteembossedcut outit did not shineit glared from the skyIt made a melted moonstone of the atmosphereIt faded the few clouds to a sapphire grayjust touched here and there with the chalky dot of a starIt slashed a silver trail across a sea jet black except where the waves rimmed it with snowUp in the white enchantmentbut not far above themthe strange air creatures were flyingThey were not birdsthey were winged womenDartingdivingglancingcurvingwheelingthey interwove in what seemed the premeditated figures of an aerial danceTheir wingslike enormous scimitarscaught the moonlightflashed it backFor an intervalthey played close in a group inextricably intertwineda revolving ball of vivid colorThenas if seized by a common impulsethey stretchedhand in handin a line across the sky driftedThe moonlight

blazeas if an inner mechanism had suddenly turned on all the electricitythe nextthe blaze died down to the fairy glisten given by the moonlightAs if by one impulsethey began finally to fly upwardHigher and higher they rosestill hand in handOne instantrelaxedthey seemed tiny galleonsall sails setthat floated lazilythe sport of an aerial sea anothersupple and sinuousthey seemed monstrous fish whose fins triumphantly clove the airmonarchs of that aerial seaA little of this and there came another impulseThe great wings furled close like blades leaping back to scabbardthe flying girls dropped sheer in a dizzying fallHalf way to the groundthey stopped simultaneously as if caught by some invisible air plateauThe great feathery fans opened and this time the men got the whipping whirr of them spread highpalpitated with colorFrom this lower levelthe girls began to fall againbut gentlylike dropping cloudsThey paused an instant and fluttered like a swarm of butterflies undecided where to goThen they turned out to seastreaming through the air in line stillbut one behind the otherAnd for the first timesound came from themthey threw off peals of girl laughter that fell like handfuls of diamondsTheir mirth ended in a longeerie cryTo methat is wonderful work one jeweled word after anotherAnd it s sustained through the whole bookBut of courseafter this first sense of ravishment with her picturesyou touch upon the deeper wonder of MrsGillmore her ideasThere are enough ideas in Angel Island to equip the women who are fighting for selfhood with armour that is absolutely hole proofThe winged women differ in type as widely as the men and each man chooses very quickly the type that appeals to him mostThe libertine wants the big blond onewhom they ve named Peachy the

when they cut the captiveswingsmaking flight impossibleOf coursemarriage is the next stepand laterchildren are born on Angel Island little girl children with wingsand boys without themBut all this time Julia has refused to marry Billythough she s in love with himHer only reason is that something tells her to waitInevitably the women mourn the loss of their wingsand just as they become reconciled to a second hand joy in their daughtersflightsPeachy s husband informs her that flying is unwomanly that woman s place is in the homenot in the airand that their daughter must be shorn of her wings as soon as she s eighteenWhat nextRebellionwith Julia shining gloriously as leaderShe had been waiting for thisAnd in ten pages of profoundsimplemagnificent talk if only every woman in the

earth is a good placeand they must learn to live in itBesidestheir children will fly better for learning to walkand walk better for knowing how to fly and she prophesies that 12 The Little Review then will be born to one of them a boy child with wingsThe women hide and master the art of walkingWhile they re doing this their poor wings have a chance to grow a littleand by the time the men are ready to capture and subdue them a second time they have achieved a combination of walking and flying that puts them beyond reachThen the men submit and Julia asks Billy to marry herThat s allexcept one short chapter about JuliaShe has a son with wings And then she dies radiantwhitegoddess womanwhose life had been so fine a thingThe beauty of it all simply overwhelmed meAll of which points to several important conclusionsFirstthat MrsGillmore is a poet and prophet of golden valuesSecondthat prejudice is the most foolish thing in the worldA general prejudice against that obvious form of comedy called farce might cause you to miss The Legend of LeonoreAnd a stubborn caution in regard to allegorieswhichI concedegenerally are unsubtlemight keep you from Angel IslandCorrespondence Two Views of

follows that under existing conditions the unrestricted meeting and companionship of men and women in society is a notorious shama merely dangerous pretence of encountersThe safe reality beneath those liberal appearances is that a woman must be content with the easy friendship of other women and of one man onlyletting a superficial friendship towards all other men veil impassable abysses of separationand a man must in the same way have one sole woman intimate To me that is an intolerable state of affairsbut is realityNow can you suppose that is Wells s own reasoning that he puts into the mouth of his unfortunate heroTalk about Edith Wharton being thin lipped in the pursuit of her heroines that s a great deal better than being loose lipped don t you agree with me It may be trueand I rather think to some extent it is truethat a man cannot have an absorbing friendship with a woman and not run the risk of falling in loveBut what does that proveThat he should be allowed free rein and carry on as many liaisons veiled under the name of friendship as he choosesOr unveiledratherfor Wells seems to want everything in the openHe s like a child who says Here s a very dangerous beast in a flimsyinadequate cageFrequently he escapes from it and has to be put back inLet s abolish the cage and let the beast run about openlydoing what it wantsAnd the good old fashioned word for that beast is lustand it should be caged if the cage is getting more and more inadequate it s only a piece with what Agnes Repplier calls our loss of nerveHow I liked that article of hers What in the name of sense are we in this world for if not to build up a characterReview 13 That s all that amounts to anythingand it comes from countless denials and countless responses to dutyAnd what Goethe saidsome time agois still everlastingly true Euc h behren sollst Dusollst eutbehren Deny yourselfdenydeny He ought to knowtoobecause he tried indulgencegoodness knowsand knew the dregs at the bottom of that cupAnd I can t forgive WellsHe knows better than to let people make all manner of experiment with such thingsThey wouldn t even be happyfor happiness is built of stabilityloyaltycharacterand again characterMy husband saidafter reading that passage in The Passionate FriendsThe trouble with him and the class he writes of is that they aren t busy enoughLetem work for a livingbe interested in something vitally for ten hours out of the twenty fourand they ll forget all about their neighborswives and be content with good men friends and casual women friends The trouble lies with poor old human natureI guessand the way it wants what it cannot and ought not to haveBut Wells says all unreality is hateful to himLet s tear down the barrierslet s show up for what we arePoor Smith wants something his neighbor has welllet s give it to himwhether it s his neighbor s success or his wife or his happinessNature is still unbearably ugly in lots of waysWhen we can train it to be unselfish and disinterested then it will be time to tear down barriersLady Mary in The Passionate Friends is an unconvincing charactertooI can conceive of a woman who will take all of a man s possessionsgiving him nothing in returnnot even fidelitybut I cannot conceive of her justifying herself unless she is an utter moral degenerateThe danger of such writers as Wells is 14 The Little that they are plausible enough till you look below the surfaceHe tries to represent Lady Mary as charmingbut sheit seems to meeven more than modern society which he arraignsis honeycombed and rotten with evilMM The description of a little old Victorian lady who sits in the background of our consciousness and plays conscience for us is charmingbut She s a sweet faced little lady to whom the universe is as clear as crystal and as simple as plane geometryShe is always knittingand what she knits is a fine web of sentimentality with which to cover the nakedness of truthfor it is not seemlymy dearthat anythingeven truthshould be naked This web of hers is as fine as soft silk and as strong as chain mailIt s stickytooAnd it clothes truth so thoroughly that she grows unrecognizable to any but the most penetrating searcher to HGWellsfor instanceIt s natural enough that the old lady should dislike Wellsfor he s found her outhe s made the astonishing discovery that underneath the web life is not sentimentally simpleHe discloses to her scandalized eyes various unfortunate facts which she has done her best to concealas for instance the fact that there is such a thing as sex Sex says Wells in effect in every one of his novelsis a disturbing elementthe disturbing elementin lifeSo long as sex exists it is a physical impossibility that life should be the sweetly pretty parlor game our little Victorian lady would have it Right here the husband of the little lady has something to say The trouble with him and the class he writes of he Review announcesis that they aren t busy enoughLetem work for a livingbe interested in something vitally for ten hours out of the twenty fourand they ll forget all about their neighborswives and be content with good men friends and casual women friends This is an excellent example of what Wells finds the next most disturbing element in life muddle headedness the lack of ability to think straightto think things throughLet Wells be vitally interested in something for ten hours of the twenty four Doesn t he see that if Wells had ever limited himself to ten hours of interest he would be making shirts todayIt is because Wells works twenty five hours of the twenty four at beingvitally interested in something that he is one of the major prophets of our timeAnd the thing in which he is interested is life itselfthe great unsolvable mysterylife which extends below the simplepolished surface that is all the Victorian lady knows as the sea extends below its glassy smoothness on a summer dayOne of the greatest things that Wells has done for some of us who came on him young enough so that our minds did not close automatically at his first startling revelationis thishe taught us to look at life squarelywithout moral cantand with a scientific disregard as to whether it pleased us personally or notWe may not always agree with him very likely we don t but at least we must face the issue squarely and not take refuge in the vague sentimentality and slushy hopefulness of the Victorian ladyWells states facts and very frequently lets it go at thatWitness the shock this method is to our little old ladyShe asks how anyone at all worth while can be so really wicked as to write about sex and society as he doesShe admits that what he says is a factThe Little Review butit sticks out like a jaggeduntidy rock from the smooth surface of things therefore it is wickedAs a matter of fact that statement of his has no more to do with moralityis no more wickedor virtuousthan the statement of a physical fact to sayfor instancethat glass breaks when hurled against a stone wallIt is unfortunatebut it is not wicked Nothe day of Victorianism is pastW e are slashing away the webwe are learning to thinkIt is a slow and painful process and we know not yet where the struggle will endBut at least we shall be nearer to the divine nakedness of truthIf Wells has done nothing else than to prove to us how much of our thinking is dictated not by our own souls but by the artificially imposed sentimentality of the little old Victorian lady he has done a full man s workAnd we who owe our emancipation largely to his vision can never be too thankful to himF RANCES T REVORRupert Brooke and Whitman You treated Brooke in a masterly way in the last issueI saw many things I hadn t seen beforeand understood the Wagner betterBut I disagree with you in one wayThe Wagner and the Channel Passage are merely clever realistic satire that s always worth whileBut it s the thought behind the Menelaus and Helen sort of thing that I don t likeOf course there s no doubt that Helen grew wrinkled and peevishBut to say that therefore Paris in his grave was better off than Menelaus living is just a bit decadentisn t itI m forced to picture Brooke as the sort of chap who couldn t enjoy a good dinner if he had to wash the dishes afterward instead of regarding dishwashing as a natural variety of living that could be thoroughly enjoyable with shirtsleeves and a pipeI m afraid he wouldn t play American football for fear of getting his face dirtyHe s just a bit finicky about lifeHe s afraid to commit himself for fear he ll have to endure something about which he can t weave golden syllablesThat s the reason I don t agree with you about Whitman liking all of himWhitman was frank about the whole worlddirt and

of craft love all the rest must followas the spirit of self revelationwhich is also a part of the new notewill follow any true present day love of craftYou will remember we once discussed Coningsby Dawson s The Garden Without WallsWhat I quarreled with in that book was that the writer looked outside of himself for his materialEven realists have clone thisasfor exampleHowells and to that extent have failedThe master Zola failed hereWhy do we so prize the work of WhitmanTolstoyDostoevskyTwainand FieldingIs it not because as we read we are constantly saying to ourselvesThis book is trueA man of flesh and blood like myself has lived the substance of itIn the love of his craft he has done the most difficult of all things revealed the workings of his own soul and mind To get near to the social advance for which all moderns hungeris it not necessary to have first of all understandingHow can I love my neighbor if I do not understand himAnd it is just in the wider diffusion of this understanding that the work of a great writer helps the advance of mankindI would like to have you think much of this in your attitude toward all present day writersIt is so easy for them to bluff us from our positionand I know from my own experience how baffling it is constantly to be coming upon goodwell done work that is falseIn this connection I am tempted to give you the substance of a formula I have just worked outIt lies here before meand if you will accept it in the comradely spirit in which it is offered I shall be gladIt is the most delicate and the most unbelievably difficult task to catchunderstandand record your own moodThe thing must be done simply and without pretense or windinessfor the moment these creep in your record is no longer a recordbut a mere mass of words meaning nothingThe value of such a record is not in the facts caught and recorded but in the fact of your having been able truthfully to make the recordsomething within yourself will tell you when you have not done it truthfullyI myself believe that when a man can thus stand aside from himselfrecording simply and truthfully the inner workings of his own mindhe will be prepared to record truthfully the workings of other mindsIn every man or woman dwell dozens of men and womenand the highly imaginative individual will lead fifty livesSurely this can be The Little said if it can be said that the unimaginative individual has led one lifeThe practice of constantly and persistently making such a record as this will prove invaluable to the person who wishes to become a true critic of writing in the new spiritWhenever he finds himself baffled in drawing a character or in judging one drawn by anotherlet him turn thus in upon himselftrusting with child like simplicity and honesty the truth that lives in his own mindIndeedone of the great rewards of living with small children is to watch their faith in themselves and to try to emulate them in this artIf the practice spoken of above is followed diligentlya kind of partnership will in time spring up between the hand and the brain of the writerHe will find himself becoming in truth a Review 17 cattle herdera drug clerka murdererfor the benefit of the hand that is writing of theseor the brain that is judging the work of another who has written of theseTo be sure this result will not always followand even after long and patient following of the system one will run into barren periods when the brain and the hand do not co ordinateIn such a period it seems to me the part of wisdom to drop your work and begin again patiently making a record of the workings of your own mindtrying to put down truthfully those workings during the period of failureI would like to scold every one who writesor who has to do with writinginto

scratch to keep up the speed which is righttooMHpWomen and the Life Struggle CLARA ELAUGHLINThe Truth About Womenby CGasquoine HartleyMrsWalter MGallichanDoddMeadampCompanyNew York MrsGallichan has not told the whole truth about woman but she has told as much of it as has been told by any one writer except Olive Schreinerand although she has made no important discoveryeduced no brilliant new conclusionshe has summarized the best of all that has been said in a book which can scarcely fail to render notable serviceIt is interesting to recall how the truth about women has been disclosedThe voice of Mary Wollstonecraftcrying in the wildernessin 1792pleaded that if woman be not prepared by education to become the companion of manshe will stop the progress of knowledgefor truth must be common to all Yet it was nearly sixty years before Frederick Denison Maurice was able to open Queen s Collegeand give a few English women the opportunity of an education In AmericaMary Lyon had already broken ground for the higher education of her countrywomen Here and therein those daysan intrepid female declared herself a believer in woman s rights but her pretensions were scarcely honored to the point even of ridiculeWomen were inferior creaturesdesigned and ordered by God to be subordinate to menDidn t everything go to prove itAndindeednearly everything seemed to In 1861several scholarly gentlemen The Little in Europe were delving in fields of research where they were destined to upturn facts of great interest to the inferior sexOne of these was John Stuart Millwhose impassioned protest against the subjection of women was then being writtenalthough it was not published until eight years laterAnother was Henry Mainewho was disclosing some significant things about the ancient law on which our modern laws are foundedAnother was Leckywho was gathering material for his History of European Moralsfrom Augustus to Charlemagneand incidentally discovering that natural history of morals wherewith he was to shock the world in 1869But two of the others were searching back of Augustus back of him both in point of time and also in degree of civilizationOne of these was Bachofena Germanwho publishedin 1861Das Mutterrechtin which he made it clear that women had not always been subordinatedependentbut among primitive peoples had been the rulers of their raceMcLennan s Primitive Marriagepublished in 1865brought prominently to British thinkers this quite new contention of woman as a creature born to rulebut defrauded and degradedThenin 1871Darwin startled the world with The Descent of Manand Selection in Relation to Sexand those who accepted his theory of evolution had to revise all their previous notions about the relations of the sexesDuring the next quarter century many minds were busy with this wholesale revision of ideasbut nothing signal was set forth until Charlotte Stetson working with the historical data of Maine and Mill and Lecky and their followerswith the ethnological data of Bachofen and McLennanand many Review moreand with the natural history of morals as Darwin and Wallace and Huxley and their school disclosed it declared that the enslavement of women was economic in its origin and in its final analysisThis was not the whole truthbut it was so important a part of the whole that the book Women and Economics may be said to have given the most productive stimulus the feminist movement had had since The Descent of ManScoresalmost hundredsof books dealing with some phase or other of woman s historyappeared in the next few yearsBut while many of them were valuableand some were all but invaluablenone of them was epoch marking until Olive Schreiner put forth her magnificent fragment on Woman and Laborthe chapter on Parasitism being the noblest and most pregnant thing that any student of woman has given to the worldOlive Schreiner saw much further into the question of women and economics than Charlotte Stetson knew how to seeShe has a greater visionShe perceives that women are ennobled by what they do just as men are and that they are degraded by being denied creativeproductive labor not by being denied the full reward of their toilMrsGallichan does not advance upon the contribution of MrsSchreineras MrsSchreiner did upon that of MrsStetson but she had less opportunity to do so MrsSchreiner did not leave so much for some one else to sayBut MrsGallichan has summarized all that has been said more fully than any other writer has doneand she has done it so interestinglyso ably that she deserves grateful praiseHer book has three sections the biologicalthe historicaland the modern22 The Little Let no one resent or think useless an analogy between animal love matings and our ownIn tracing the evolution of our love passions from the sexual relations of other mammalsand back to those of their ancestorsand to the humblerthough scarcely less beautifulancestors of thesewe shall discover what must be considered as essential and should be lastingand what is false in the conditions and character of the sexes todayand thereby we shall gain at once warning in what directions to pauseand new hope to send us forwardWe shall learn that there are factors in our sex impulses that require to be lived down as out of date and no longer beneficial to the social needs of lifeBut encouragement will come aslooking backwardswe learn how the mighty dynamic of sex love has evolved in finenesswithout losing in intensityhow it is tending to become more mutualmore beautifulmore lastingTwo suggestions which MrsGallichan makes in the biological section are especially strikingOne is derived from the beeand one from the spiderThe beeshe reminds usbelongs to a highly evolved and complex societywhich may be said to represent a very perfected and extreme socialismIn this society the vast majority of the population the workers are sterile femalesand of the dronesor malesonly a very few at the most are ever functionalReproduction is carried on by the queen mother specialized for maternity and incapable of any other function I have little doubt that something which is at least analogous to the sterilization of the female bees is present among ourselvesThe complexity of our social conditionsresulting in the great disproportion between the number of the sexeshas tended to set aside a great number of women from the normal expression of their sex functionsThe danger to societywhen maternity shall be left to the stupid parasitic women who arc unable to exist as workersis pointed out by MrsGallichan as is also that exaggerated form of matriarchy which is realized among the ants and beesAnd she reminds women who are workersnot mothersthat in the bee workers the ovipositor becomes a poisoned stingShe warns Review women not to become like the sterile beesbut she warns them also against state endowment of motherhoodAnd she does not suggest how the great excess of women are to become mothers without reorganizing societyThe second example she cites in warningthe common spiderwhose courtship customs Darwin described in The Descent of Manis a case of female superiority carried to a savage conclusion And from this female who ruthlessly devours her loverMrsGallichan deduces a theory formany of those wrongs which women have suffered at the hands of menManacting instinctivelyhas rebellednot so muchI thinkagainst woman as against this driving hunger within himselfwhich forces him helpless into her power The stages by which parasitism was transferred from the male to the female still need some elucidation like the stages by which marriage passed from endogamy to exogamyBut MrsGallichan s suggestion about the male preserving himself by appearing as self sufficient and as dominant as he canis highly interestingIt will probably not be long before we know a great deal more of thisIn the historical section of her bookMrsGallichan devotes four admirable chapters to the mother age civilizationand four others to the position of women in EgyptBabylonGreeceand RomeOf immense significance is the relation between the enviable status of women in Egypt and that love of peace and of peaceful pursuits which characterized the Egyptian peopleWarpatriarchyand the subjection of womenhave gone hand in handSocial organizations in which might was right have minimized the worth of women those in which ingenuityresourcefulnessand ideality The Little Review 23 were set above brute force have given women most justiceMrsGallichan s chapter on the women of Athens and of Sparta is most suggestiveSo is that on the women of RomeIn her modern section she discusses women and laborThe old way of looking at the patriarchal family wasfrom one point of thoughtperfectly right and reasonable as long as every woman was ensured the protection ofand maintenance bysome manNor do I think there was any unhappiness or degradation involved to women in this co operation of the old dayswhere the man went out to work and the woman stayed to do work at least equally valuable in the homeIt wasas a rulea co operation of loveand in any case it was an equal partnership in workBut what was true once is not true nowWe are living in a continually changing development and modification of the old tradition of the relationship of woman and manThe women of one class have been forced into labor by the sharp driving of hungerAmong the women of the other class have arisen a great number who have turned to seek occupation from an entirely different causethe no less bitter driving of an unstimulating and ineffective existencea kind of boiling over of women s energy wastedcausing a revolt of the woman soul against a life of confused purposesachieving by accident what is achieved at allBetween the women who have the finest opportunities and the women who have none there is this common kinship the wastage not so much of woman as of womanhoodShe considers the women who have been forced into the cheatingdamning struggle for life and urges thatthe life blood of womenthat should be given to the raceis being stitched into our ready made clothes washed and ironed into our linenpoured into our adulterated foods and so onBut her reasoning in this chapter is not very clearWomento avoid parasitismmust workand only a relatively small proportion of them can now find in their homes work enough to keep them self sustainingProtest against the sweating of women is not only philanthropic it is perfectly sound political economyWomen workers not only should be protected against long hoursunnecessary risksinsanitary surroundingsmerciless nerve tensionand the computation of their wages on a basis of their assured ability to live partly by their labor and partly by the legitimatized or unlegitimatized sale of their sexbut this canand mustbe doneYetwhen all this has been accomplishedwill MrsGallichan feel satisfied that the struggle for life is not cheatingdamning if owing to conditions we cannot regulate that struggle fails also to comprehend the struggle to give lifeto reproduceIt is because we are the mothers of men that we claim to be freeThis is the keynote of her bookBut she is by no means clear in her mind as to how the mothers of men are to maintain themselves in a freedom which shall be realnot merely conceded nor as to how the millions of women whounder our monogamous societiescannot be permanently matedare to justify their struggle for existence by becoming mothers of men The something that MrsGallichan lacksnot in her retrospect so much as in her previsioninghas been lacked by many of the great investigators and writers who have built up the magnificent literature of evolution and evolutionary philosophy she has an admirable survey of thewhencenessof life and love and laborbut a short sightedastigmatic vision of its whereuntoness If the sole purpose of life and love and laboramong humans as among lower animalsis to continue lifeto transmit the life forcethen indeed are The Little those frustratedfutile creatures who are cheatedor who cheat themselvesout of rendering this one service to the world which can justify them for having lived in itBut ifas most of us believewe are more than just links in the human chainif we have a relation to eternity as well as to history and to posteritythere are splendid interpretations of our struggles that MrsGallichan does not apprehendIf souls are immortallife is more than the perpetuation of speciesor even than theimprovement of the race it is the place allotted to us for the development of that imperishable part which we are to carry henceand through eternityAnd any effort of ours which helps other souls to realize the best that life can giveto seek the best that immortality can perpetuatemay splendidly justify our existenceMrsGallichan s conclusion about religion is that it is an opium to which women resort when they have no proper outlet for their sex impulsesI am certain she saysthat in us the religious impulse and the sex impulse are Review one And when she was able to satisfy the sex impulseshe no longer had any need of or interest in religionThe limitations this puts upon her interpretation of life are too obvious to need catalogingAnd this is the reason she signally fails to tell the whole of the truth about womanThis is the reason why the latter chapters of her bookin which she writes of marriage and divorce and prostitutionare of less worth to the generality of readers than the earlier onesthough this is not to say that these chapters do not contain a very great deal of vigorous thinking and excellent suggestionBut to anyone who holds that the continuance of life is the principal justification for having livedyet deplores free love and state endowment of mothersthere is inevitably an appalling wastefor the elimination of which she may well be staggered to suggest a remedyMrsGallichan s book is not constructive in effectBut it is so excellently analyticalas far as it goesthat it can scarcely fail to provoke a great deal of thoughtChange There is coming soonto the Fine Arts Theatre that charming Chicago home of the Irish Players and of the new notein drama a play with an interesting titleIt is called ChangeIt is to be given by the Welsh Players which fact alone has a thrill in itBut the theme is even more compellingTwo old God fearing Welsh people have denied themselves of comforts and pleasures to give their sons an educationThenwhen they expect to reap the benefits of the sacrificethree unexpected and awful things happen the student son has so fallen under the influence of modern skepticism as to be forced to abandon his father s Calvinistic creedThe second one has become soaked with socialism and syndicalismThe thirda chronic invalidis a Christian and a comfortbut he is killedquite unnecessarilyin a labor conflict instigated by his brotherThen the two old people againaloneWhat can a playwright do with such a situationNothingcertainlyto attract a capacity house But we shall be among the first of that small minority who likes thinking in the theatre to hear what MrFrancis has to sayHis theme is tremendousThe Little Review The Poetry of Alice Meynell LLEWELLYN OT least among the stirring events of our present poetical renaissance are the publication of the collected editions of the works of Alice Meynell and Francis ThompsonScribner Spiritually akinmutually influencing one another in material as in more subtle waystheir poetry stands in vivid contrast to the muse of our younger singersthe makers of what English critics hail as a new Georgian AgeThat this difference gives them an added significanceand not as some critics have saida lessened oneis the burden of the present appreciation of the poems of Alice MeynellFor there is a tendency for the reader who is intoxicated with poetic modernity to reason somewhat after this fashionHerehe will sayas indeed MrAustin Harrison has said of Francis Thompson is a reed pipe of neo mediaevalism a poet of the gargoyle not of this modern worldand so neither in sympathy of thought or melody with us of the twentieth centuryits free life and vers libreAll thisof coursebecauseFrancis Thompson was as is MrsMeynell a child of the Catholic ChurchOur supposititious reader will continue to the effect that there is no spiritual profit to be had in reading these poets when the modern attitude is to be found in such writers as WWGibsonMasefieldand HardyBut in so arguingour reader will be entirely wrong as to the factsand mistaken in his whole manner of approach to the realm of poetic valuesMrMax Eastmanin his charming bookThe Enjoyment of Poetrylays JONES stress on the fact that poetry is not primarily the registering of emotions but the expression of keen realizationsA mathematical concept may arouse an emotionbut the poet makes the actual emotion transmissible by his selective power in picking out the focal point of the experience b y which it is arousedIf poetry is essentially realization of lifethen we have no longer any excuse for asking our poets to share our doctrinal views before we consent toread themOn the contrarywe should be more anxious to read MrsMeynell than MrGibsonif we are modernistsfor MrGibson mayconceivablynot be able to tell us anything we have not already feltMrsMeynellon the other handcan inform our feelings with fresh aspects of experienceand she does so abundantlyHer Catholicism is not mediaevalismbutin so far as it is translatable into her poetry it is simply a vocabulary for the expression of certain emotional realizations of life which we modernists find it very hard to express because we do not have the necessary vocabularyWhat can be more modern than the doctrine of the immanence of God and his abode in manthat much discussed social gospel Yet the following poemnot in spite of but through its Catholic terminologyheightens our realization of brotherhood and dependence one upon anotherIt is entitled The Unknown GodOne of the crowd went upAnd knelt before the Paten and the CupReceived the Lordreturned in peaceand prayed Close to my sidethen in my heart I said26 The LittleO Christin this man s life This stranger who is Thine in all his strifeAll his felicityhis good and illIn the assaulted stronghold of his willI do confess Thee hereAlive

peacethis destiny That I shall never knowlook upon me Christ in his numbered breathChrist in his beating heart and in his deathChrist in his mysteryFrom that secret place And from that separate dwellinggive me graceThe spectacle of a general communion again gives MrsMeynell inspiration for a poem whose last two stanzas apply equally as well to the secularevolutionary view of salvation as they do to the ecclesiastical viewand whose last stanza is most suggestive in the light it throws upon the puzzling discrepancy between the littleness of man and the unlimited material vast in which he finds himself a floating speckI saw this people as a field of flowersEach grown at such a price The sum of unimaginable powers Did no more than sufficeA thousand single central daisies theyA thousand of the oneFor eachthe entire monopoly of dayFor eachthe whole of the devoted sunEven so typically modern a philosopher as Henri Bergson would find one of his leading and rather baffling ideas beautifully realized in one of MrsMeynell s sonnetsMatterBergson tells usin all its manifestations is moulded by a spiritual push from behind itso that the sensible world is not a mosaic of atoms obeying fixed laws but rather a cosmic compromise between matter and spirita modus vivendi the operation of which Review would seem very different to us were our viewpoint that of pure spiritSays MrsMeynell in To a DaisySlight as thou artthou art enough to hide Like all created thingssecrets from meAnd standa barrier to eternityAnd Ihow can I praise thee well and wide From where I dwell upon the hither sideThou little veil for so great mysteryWhen shall I penetrate all things and theeAnd then look backFor this I must abideTill thou shalt grow and fold and be unfurled Literally between me and the worldThen I shall drink from in beneath a springAnd from a poet s side shall read his bookO daisy minewhat shall it be to look From God s side even of such a simple thingThe sense of what mightperhapsbe called restrained paradox in that sonnetis frequently met with in MrsMeynell s writingsand it corresponds to aspects of reality which the old religious phraseology she has so freshly minted for us is alone fitted to conveyThe Young Neophyte is a beautiful sonnet enshrining the fatefulness of every human actionthe gift of the full flower which is implicit in the gift of the smallest budthe preparation we are constantly making for crises which are yet hidden in the futureThoughts in Separation also deals with the paradoxical overcoming of the handicaps of personal absence of our friends through community of thought and feelingNot only are these paradoxes in human psychology delicately set forth by the poetbut those darker ones of human work and destiny are consolingly illuminated in such a poem as Builders of Ruins which does not depend for its quality of consolation upon anything foreign to its poetic truthOne poem in the book isperhapsmost remarkable for the light it throws upon the sense in which the term poetic truth may be usedand as showing the The Little Review difference between the poeticthe realizableandthereforethe true side of a religion the side Matthew Arnold was so anxious to keep and the mere theological frameworkalways smelling of unreality and always in need of renovationThe poem may stand as a warning against confusing real poetry in whose truth we need not be afraid to trust because its author does not inhabit our own thought world with versified theologyIf all of MrsMeynell s work were like her Messina1908then the critic and reader who now mistakenly shun her would be rightAnd the poem is a curious commentary upon MrEastman s insistence that poetic is realizationFor in her other poems the author has presented those aspects of her religion which are verifiable in experiencePerhaps the quotations given above bear out that pointBut one aspect of religious thought has now been pretty generally abandonednot because it has ever been proven falsebut because we have never succeeded in realizing it for ourselvesThe God of orthodox church theodicy never did make good Christthe Saintsand even the very material form of the cross itself had to mediate between man and the divineAnd it is precisely in the one case in this book where MrsMeynell tries to present the governing rather than the immanent God to us that she fails asif poetry be realizationwe should expect her to failThe first stanza of the poem addressed to the Deity describes in a few bold strokes the wreck of Messinaand ends with the lines Destroyerwe have cowered beneath Thine own Immediate unintelligible handThe second stanza describes the missions of mercy to the stricken cityand ends our shattered fingers feel Thy mediate and intelligible handThe essential weakness of this dependence for poetic effect upon the two adjectives and their negatives is no less obvious than the weakness of the poet s attribution of such apparently impulsive and then retractatory conduct to a God whose ways must either be explicable in terms of a human sense of order or not made the subject of human discourse at allMrsMeynell describes herself in one of these poems as a singer of a single moodSome of her critics have taken her at her word and saved themselves some trouble thereby in their task of appreciationBut as a matter of factshe should not be taken at her own modest estimatefor her one mood is such a pervasive onesuch a large and sane moodthat it pays to look at more than one aspect of life through its coloringAnd in truthbesides her better known poems which need no further mention hereThe Lady Poverty and Renouncementfor examplethere will be found within the small compass of her beautifully housed collection of verse many aspects of natureall of them instinct with a mystic shimmer of lifeas well as aspects of the innermost life of man which it is given to few spirits to sing in words onlyin factto those spirits whose effort it is to make their poetry Plainbehind oracles and past All symbolssimpleperfectheavenly wild The song some loaded poets reach at last The kings that found a ChildTo have the sense or creative activity

Essays in CriticismFirst Series The Little Review A n Ancient Radical WILLIAM LEuripides and His Ageby Gilbert MurrayTheconspiracy of silencewhich oppressed the youth of those of us who were born in the late Victorian era never seems more hateful than when some master hand connects the present labors of liberty with the strivings of the infinite pastIn some fashion the dominating spirits of a generation ago contrived to make the struggles for human freedom appear as ugly isolated episodes without precursors or ancestryThey forgot the Shelleys and the Godwins and they even denied the significance of the classic forerunners of today s ardent prophetsThere were happy exceptionsSome of us cherish the teachings of a Virginia professor whoas far as the adolescent capacities of his students permittedbridged the gap between Socrates s free questionings and the contemporary yearnings for a world of uncompromising justice and beautyWhat that Southern student did for his small band of followers Gilbert Murray has long been doing for the great worldHis present contribution belongs to that satisfying seriesThe Home University LibraryIncidentallyone reflects that this Home University is one of the few institutions of learning which has completely avoided the blinders so many are complacently wearingThe Euripides of Murray suggests to the author and to the readerone may claim both Tolstoi and IbsenButone hastens to stateProfessor Murray is too learned and thoughtful a man to paint a revolutionary Euripides such as The Masses much as one loves that exuberant Don CHENERYHenry Holt and CompanyNew York Quixote would delight to honor and to portrayHis onsethowevercatches us Every man who possesses real vitality can be seen as the resultant of two forces says Murray H e is first the child of a particular agesocietyconventionof what we may call in one word a traditionHe is secondlyin one degree or anothera rebel against that traditionAn d the best traditions make the best rebelsEuripides is the child of a strong and splendid tradition and istogether with Platothe fiercest of all rebels against itEuripideslike ourselvescomes in an age of criticismfollowing upon an age of movement and actionAn d for the most partlike ourselveshe accepts the general standards on which the movement and action were basedHe accepts the Athenian ideals of free thoughtfree speechdemocracy virtue and patriotismHe arraigns his country because she is false to them The suffragist and the feminist movements have recently brought the great dramatist to his proper appreciation in respect to womenSome of the passages in the Medea are quoted as often in suffragist campaigns as the words of Bernard Shaw or of Olive SchreinerThis Greek is sometimes said to be the first literary man who understood womenFor that reasonas Professor Murray so charmingly emphasizesEuripides was ever accounted a woman haterdespite even the implications of his great chorus which sings so nobly woman s destined rise as a power in the worldHis statement of the cause of barbarian woman against a civilized man who has wronged her is incomparably more contemporary than Madam Butterflyand with Murray we may doubti f ever the deserted one has found such words of fire as Medea The Little Review speaks Andas the author continuesMedea is not only a barbarian she is also a womanand fights the horrible war that liesan eternally latent possibilitybetween woman and manSome of the most profound and wounding things said both by Medea and Jason might almost be labelled in a book of extractsAny Wife to Any HusbandorAny Husband to Any WifeThe change which came over the spirit of Euripides s visionas Athens itself was transformed by empire lust from the first glories of Periclessuggest again the purifying satire of our ablest modernsWar is hateful and the picture which the Attic dramatist drew of the horrors of dying Troy leave little to the present imaginationEuripides accordingly became as popular in imperialistic Athens as was Bebel among the Kaiser s ministersMurray interprets this phase magnificentlyHe concludes This scenewith the parting between Andromache and the child which followsseems to me perhaps the most heartrending in all the tragic literature of the worldAfter rising from it one understands Aristotle s judgment of Euripides as the most tragic of the poets One has only to recall the brave gentleness of Hector s wifedescribed first in Homeric wordsto agree with the present authorFor those whose lives are chaotic personal loves must also be chaotic this or that passionmalicea jesting humorsome physical lustgratified vanityegotistical pridewill rule and limit the relationship and color its ultimate futilityHGWells in First and Last ThingsOn the purely critical side Professor Murray s words are vastly importantEspecially valuable is his discussion of the chorus and the deus ex machina concerning which so much error has been taught since Horace wrote on the art of poetryBut this small book is not designed for those whose interest in Greek drama is technicalIt is Euripidesthe philosopherEuripidesthe satirist of his times Euripidesthe preacher of lofty virtuesthe apostle of new men and more righteous godswho concerns the great awakening world of 1914The intellectual battles which Euripides fought on behalf of Athens have been waged again and often for the millions who slumber and are contentThey are being fought now with an intensity unprecedentedSo it brings courage and it brings calm to realize the continuity of the conflictand to recall the signal victories of the olden daysGilbert Murray s achievements are too numerous to permit praiseOne may only say now that the present book is in line with the fine things of his pastthat by virtue of his labors the world agony for liberty and justice and beauty reveals new phases of the intrinsic dignity and honor which have been its possession since men desired better thingsIsn t it possible to be pedantic in the demand for simplicityIt s a cry whichif I notice arightnature has a jaunty way of disregardingCommand a rosebush in the stress of June to purge itselfcoerce a convolvulus out of the paths of catachresisAmen Som e Letters of William Vaughn MoodyThe Little Review Equal SuffrageThe First Real Test HENRY BLACKMAN S ELL HE query of the anti suffragistWill the women really use suffrage if they have itwas rather conclusively answered in the affirmative at Chicago aldermanic elections on April 7when equal suffrage was given its first real test in an American city of first rankThis election brought out many interesting incidents which might be considered as having laboratory valueIt has been contended by the antis that the women would be bad losers that they would not support the nonpartisan ideals which are becoming a definite part of our new patriotism that the result of equal suffrage would simply be one of double votewives voting as their husbands decided that the women coming out in the first enthusiasm of registration would not take the same interest in the prosaic work at the polls that the fights against bad nominees would result either in a duplication of man run campaignsor in ineffective and lady like campaignsThe first of these contentions was proved untrue to even the most casual observer at the polls on election dayThe women were fighting uphill all the wayand where the so termedsuffrage men were slightly unpleasant in their attitude towards the antis the women were all cheerfulness and all refreshing encouragementAs one explained It has been the most wonderful feelingworking shoulder to shoulder with the men in something that has really been our duty all along Nine women candidates were up for election and not one was chosen and yetafter talking with five defeated women candidates and three defeated men candidatesI concluded that the women knew more about the philosophy of politics and its sad uncertainties than men who had been contesting for yearsTrueelection to office is but a by product of political experience it is a most coveted by productneverthelessand when a woman like Marion Drakewho ran a close race against Chicago s bad aldermansaysat the closing of the pollsI have not been electedbut every minute of the time I have expended has been worth while and I shall try again at the next election it shows the right spirit and the fundamental error in the assertion that women cannot lose gracefullyNon partisanism could he given no real testfor these ideals seemed necessary of application in only two or three wardsIn onethe twenty first an alderman with a bad record was up for re election in opposition to a Republican of no particular meritThe women got togetherwith the aid of some of the better menand selected a non partisan candidateThis man was elected directly through the efforts of the women whoRepublicanDemocraticand Progressiverallied in true non partisan spirit to his aidAs to the control of the women s votes by the men it is interesting to note that in the more intelligent wards there was considerable variance between the men and the womenwhile in the wards of the poorer and less intellectually inclined portions of the city the votes ran a great deal alikeThe women came out in good numbers The Little andas a matter of factthe masculine vote was considerably higher than usual but even with this advantagethe registered women outvoted the registered men by a small per centThe campaigns conducted by the various women were distinctly different from the ordinary political campaignsThey were dignifiedstraightforwardstrongand effectiveMiss Drakein her campaign against John Coughlincolloquially and delicately known as Bathhouse John the name originating from the fact that the gentleman in question received his political training as a mopper and rubber in one of Chicago s most infamous bath housesmade a direct Review 31 appealin a house to housevoter to votercanvass of her wardIn this way she told over two thirds of the people of the Bathhouse s territory all about the gentlemanhis ambitionshis desiresand his insidious motivesAnd while she was defeatedit must be remembered that though Coughlin received a sufficient pluralityhe by no means attained his boast I ll beat that skirt by 8 000 votes In factwhere his plurality at the last elections was approximately eight to onethis year it was less than two and a half to onemaking an obvious deduction that Miss Drake s campaign was decidedly successful even though she did not winThe Education of Yesterday and Today WILLIAM SAPHIER The Education of Karl Wittetranslated by Leo Wiener and edited by HAddington Bruce Thomas YCrowell CompanyNew York MrSaphier is a Roumanian who came to this country only a few years ago and learned Eng lishThe following review is his first attemptushoping our readers will find it as interesting FrenchItalianEnglishGreekand German at the age of ninea Ph Ddegree at fourteena doctor of laws and an appointment to the teaching staff of the Berlin University at sixteen these were some of the achievements of Karl WitteOr shall I say of pastor Wittethe fatherFor the boy had very little to do with it he was merely a piece of putty in the able hands of a strong willed man who knew what he wanted and how to get itA child of ordinary abilitiesaccording to pastor Witte and othersKarl absorbed an enormous amount of knowledge in a comparatively short timeas a result of a method of education which began almost as soo n as he showe d intelligenceThe bookoriginally Written about one at writingand we print it just as it came toas we didhundred years ago whe n scientific advice on the subject was lackingis a remarkable documentIt is full of useful information and practical hints to parents and people interested in the education of childreneven in this day of scientific methods and conflicting authoritiesBut as Ave might have expectedthe disciplin e reminds us a little of the German Kaserne The spilling of a little milk on the tablecloth was punished by enforced abstinence from all foods except bread and saltPunishment as a remedy for an offense is always wrong because it does not prove the responsibility of the act to the childThe spirit in which pastor Witte went about his task is show n in the following passage 32The Little The firmness in executing my purpose went so far that even our house dog knew the emphasis of the wordsI must work and calmed down the moment we spoke these words softly into his earsAlmost from the outset this made an enormous impression on KarlHe soon became accustomed to look upon his work time as something sacredThe development of intellectual and moral couragethe most important qualities any man or woman may possesswere neglectedat least were not given the attention they deserveT o inculcate in the child a desire for liberty and social equalityhe overlooks entirelyThe father is really the more remarkable of the twoA product of the method of education prevailing at the timehe stands as a refutation of his own theoriesPastor Witte conceived and carried out an idea successfullyHe did somethingat least theoreticallyworth whileThe son died at eighty threeNow what difference would it have made either to the boy or to the world if his appointment to the teaching staff of Berlin had come at a later dateMost methods of education aim at the training of the senses and the accumulation of factsWhile these are necessaryI think the speed at which this is done is immaterial to the childSome of the finest men and womenwho made this a better world to live inhad no scientific training in their child hood or laterWe need not go back to history to find themMaxime Gorkyfor instancelost his parents before he was four years oldand began to read under the supervision of a cook at six teenJack London is another instance that suggests itself readily to one s mindOf course these are exceptional peo plebut take the thousands of able and brainy men and women in labor organ izations and idealists in all walks of lifeUsually they had very little attention Review from their parentseither because they had no time or did not know enoughThese men and women who had to rub up against the rough edges of our moneymaking machinery and to stand squarely on their feet facing this world and its problems willing to lend a handyeseven to give their lives for the betterment of social and economic conditionsthese persons are worthy of the nameNow I don t want to say anything against the early training of childrenThe kindergarten and all the methods of early training in schools have come into existence because there is a real need for themParentsfor many reasonsno longer have the time to train their own children but we expect results from education in general that cannot be accomplishedWhat good are all the learning and scientific facts that we have accumulated up to nowif we don t use them to make our life richer and more beautifulKnowledge and ability are worthless if there is no moral and intellectual courage to back them upPastor Witte thought the education of his son finished when he reached the age of sixteenWe to day do things in the same spiritWe get things doneNothing slow about usThe resultof courseis very poornobody is satisfiedOur expertsalways ready with advice on any and everythingtell us that what we need is technical training to provide industry with efficient helpThese educators do not see that the difficulty is not with the child but with industrial conditionsThey are going to fit the child to this misery called modern industryBut remove the possibility of the unscrupulous taking advantage of the inexperienced and simple mindedand many of the socalled educational problems will disappearThe Little Review Some Book Reviews A New Old Tagore Play ChitraA Play in One Actby Rabindranath Tagore The Macmillan CompanyNew York Nothing is more irritating to a really modern critic than to have to join in a chorus of universal praiseIt is particularly irritating when the person acclaimed is a Nobel prize winnerfor surely those of us who sit in private judgment in secluded places ought to be able to discern values subtler than the ones open to the eyes of some mysterious frock coated and silk hatted jury of professors in Stockholmor wherever it may beThe very marrow in the bones of criticism curdles at the thought of agreeing with a popular awardBut a certain native honesty and a distinct desire to spread good news obliges onein the case of Chitrato withhold the amiable dissecting knifeThe play is far too beautiful to serve as a cadaver for the illustration of either the anatomist s skill or the facts of anatomyLet it be confessed that this reviewerwho was about to send the book back with a refusal to review any work of Tagorefoundafter reading a few linesthat he was forced to go onand that having once gone onhe preferred to write the review rather than to give up the bookThis play was written twenty five years agoand belongsthereforeto that earlier strata of Tagore s life which is to the normal mind so much more alluring than the latter detritus that seems to have accumulated over himHis later work appears to be old with the old age of Asia and with the old age of himselfIts fundamental feeling is the only bosom of a remote GodWe who regard this attitude as a perversion of manhood will turn from it with relief to the earlier writingin which the very lifeblood of our own hearts seems quivering with the intimations of a better than godlike beautyAs I have suggestedthere is very little that can rationally be said about this play ChitraT o indicate something of the nature of so perfect a work is the sole office that I can profitably performChitradaughter of a King who had no sonswas brought up to live the life and perform the activities of a manwith a man s hardness of frame and a man s directness of willOne day while hunting in the forestshe found sleeping in her path Arjunathe great warrior of the Kuru ClanThen for the first time in my life I felt myself a womanand knew that a man was before meGoing to the gods of loveChitra obtained from them the gift of a perfect and world vanquishing beauty to last for one year only and returning to Arjuna she overcame by this invincible weapon the monastic vows which he had taken upon himselfand swept him away into the wild and glorious current of her year of beautyThus the year begins Chitra At evening I lay down on a grassy bed strewn with the petals of spring flowersand recollected the wonderful praise of my beauty I had heard from Arjuna drinking drop by drop the honey that I had stored during the too familiar impulse to recline on the long dayThe history of my past lifelike The Little that of my former existenceswas forgottenI felt like a flowerwhich has but a few fleeting hours to listen to all the humming of the woodlands and then must lower its eyes from the skybend its headand at a breath give itself up to the dust without a crythus ending the short story of a perfect moment that has neither past nor futureVasantaThe God of LoveA limitless life of glory can bloom and spend itself in a morningMadanaThe God of the SeasonsLike an endless meaning in the narrow span of a songChitra The southern breeze caressed me to sleepFrom the flowering malati bower overhead silent kisses dropped over my bodyOn my hairmy breastmy feeteach flower chose a bed to die onI sleptAnd suddenlyin the depth of my sleepI felt as if some intense eager looklike tapering fingers of flametouched my slumbering bodyI started up and saw the Hermit standing before meThe moon had moved to the westpeering through the leaves to espy this wonder of divine art wrought in a fragile human frameThe air was heavy With perfumethe silence of the night was vocal with the chirping of cricketsthe reflections of the trees hung motionless in the lakeand with his staff in his hand he stoodtall and straight and stilllike a forest treeIt seemed to me that I hadon opening my eyesdied to all realities of life and undergone a dream birth into a shadow landShame slipped to my feet like loosened clothesI heard his call Belovedmy most beloved And all my forgotten lives united as one and responded to itI saidTake metake all I am And I stretched out my arms to himThe moon set behind the treesHeaven and earthtime and spacepleasure and paindeath and life merged together in an unbearable ecstasyWith the first gleam of lightthe first twitter of birdsI rose up and sat leaning on my left armHe lay asleep with a vague smile about his lips like the crescent moon in the morningThe rosy red glow of the dawn fell upon his noble foreheadI sighed and stood upI drew together the leafy lianas to screen the streaming sun from his faceI looked about me and saw the same old earthI remembered what I used to beand ran and ran like a deer Review afraid of her own shadowthrough the forest path strewn with shephali flowersI found a lonely nookand sitting down covered my face with both handsand tried to weep and cryBut no tears came to my eyesMadana Alasthou daughter of mortalsI stole from the divine storehouse the fragrant wine of heavenfilled with it one earthly night to the brimand placed it in thy hand to drinkyet still I hear this cry of anguish A few wordsa half dozen pages of prose modulated to perform an office as subtle as that of blank versegive us the exquisite essence of the year that follows and toward the end there steal into it notes of the inadequacy which the great warrior feels in this perfectionand his desire for the old and harsher round of human lifeThus the year endsMadana Tonight is thy last nightVasanta The loveliness of your body will return tomorrow to the inexhaustible stores of the springThe ruddy tint of thy lipsfreed from the memory of Arjuna s kisseswill bud anew as a pair of fresh asoka leavesand the softwhite glow of thy skin will be born again in a hundred fragrant jasmine flowersChitra O godsgrant me this my prayerTonightin its last hourlet my beauty flash its brightestlike the final flicker of a dying flameMadana Thou Shalt have thy wishAnd as it endsand as Chitra realizes that there is to fall from her that radiance which has beenfor a yearthe sole bond between her and her loverand also the sole barrier between the real her and himshe finds that his profounder longing has changed into a desire for the companionship of that strong and eager boy woman that she was before her transformationThe Little Review Chitracloaked My lordhas the cup

WheresAnd seven million Whys There s something very much like that small person in a decidedly larger person called HGWellsFor all the great sweep and astonishing convincingness of his later novels he still keeps the childlike quality of asking startling questions about everything in the universeHe still wants to know Why can t I catch the sunand what would happen if I did In his last half dozen novels he has been asking about various phases of our modern societypoliticsand the sex questionBut in this latest bookThe World Set Freehe goes back to a type of question that interested him some years agothe type half fanciful and half sociological that produced In the and When the Sleeper WakesBut this book is not entirely like the earlier onesFor one thing the science is for the first time so nearly possible that it is almost probableand for another this book is the work of an olderquieter soul with less regard for externals and with more faith in the ultimate high hope for mankindWhat Wells has asked himself this time is What would happen if man were suddenly given command over an unlimited amount of physical powerHe brings this about by modern chemistryA scientist discovers a new theory of matter which enables him to break down metals by radio activity and so generate practically limitless powerThe first use the world makes of this power is to go to warW e can hardly quarrel with Wells for the improbability of this because it sweeps the board so clear for his reconstruction periodwhich is the heart of the storyDays of the CometThe Time MachineA strange story it isone

middle of last December MrFKReilly sent a telegram to a Miss Leona Dalrymple of PassaicNew Jerseyin which he asked May I call upon you Thursday afternoon The telegram was the result of the10 000 prize contest which the Reilly and Britton Company had planned early in the year and Miss Dalrymple had just been announced as the winner by the three judges SSMcClureIda Tarbelland George NMadisonShe knew nothing of thishoweverthough she thought MrReilly s telegram must mean an interest in her work so she replied calmly that she would be pleased to see him on ThursdayThen MrReilly s eyes begin to twinkleas he tells the storyfor it is rather a joke to set out on a journey with a10 000 check in your pocket for an unsuspecting young womanEven when he explained to her and presented the check she remained calm though she is only twenty eight years old and this was her first taste of real fameShe told MrReilly that she had another novel which she hoped might interest him but he took the words out of her mouth by saying that he had come prepared to make a contract for itSo much for the latest of modern fairy talesDiane of the Green Van is the prize winning novelanddespite our first suspicion of it because of that very factit proves to be a good oneMiss Dalrymple loves the outdoorsand her present story of an American girl who goes jaunting in a van in the Florida Everglades was suggested by a newspaper clipping about an adventur 40 The Little Review ous young Englishwoman who managed to break away from conventions once a year and roam the country in a gipsy wagonNot all best sellers have as much real charm as this onePerhaps its freshness and spontaneity are due to the fact that it had to be written in six weeks for the contestMiss Dalrymple has stated that her purpose in writing novels is to entertain wholesomely through optimism and romance Usually that type of purpose is linked up with a sentimentality which means being sweet at the expense of truthBut this author is not that sort in expressing her dislike of sex storiesfor instanceshe attributes their shortcomings to treatmentnot to materialsince there is absolutely no subject under the sun which may not be treated with perfect good taste in a novel She has also stated that in her opinion the modern woman is over sexed a popular though altogether wrong headed view which we mean some time to argue with her in these columnsSlime and the Breath of Life The Russian Noveltranslated from the French of Le Vicomte EMde Vogue by Colonel HASawyer George HDoran CompanyNew York Although this book was written in 1886its treatments of PushkinGogolTurgeneffDostoevskyand Tolstoy are now first made accessible to the English readerand will still be worth his attentionIn fact one reads them with a growing regret that the authorwho died in 1910did not continue his interpretation of the Russian spirit as the religious and mystic tone of its nihilism gradually faded and left us the bleaker outlook of such men as GorkyWith Tolstoyhowever probably the greatest demonstrator of life which has arisen since Goethe the book closesThe author treats his subject from the standpoint of a certain formula which he finds to hold throughout the range of that realism which succeeded the romanticism of Pushkin a romanticism which disappeared in 1840Thereafter there grew up the great realistic school which gives Russia the leadership of the world in the field of realistic fiction a leadership due partly to the temperamental standpoint of the Russianadapted for just the kind of work which the great realistic novel involvesand partly to the importance of the novel as the vehicle of those ideas which the censor barred from every other channel of expressionIn the bible we are told that God made man out of the slime of the earth and breathed into him the breath of lifeIn those words is the secret of the Russian realistic novelFor the realism of his own country the author of this work has little praiseBecausehe saysit lacked that human sympathy which saw in man not only the slime of the earth but the breath of lifeit is barrenDickenson the other handand George Eliot gave to English realism a standpoint which was mouldednayimpregnated through and throughwith the religion of that book to which Mary Evans had renounced formal allegiance the Protestant bibleIn factDe Vogue goes so far as to say that some of her writingfor instancethe meeting between Dinah and Lisbeth is biblical in the quality of its appealand might The Little have been written by the hand that gave us RuthThis spiritbut without the Anglo Saxon hardnessis the spirit of Russian realismIt has all the photographic accuracythe preocupation with all types of life that distinguishes French realismbut the preoccupation with the divinethe mystical turning away from the things of this worldis also presentThe sympathy of Gogol is intensified to painfulness in Dostoevsky and is apotheosized into a new religion of renunciation in TolstoyAnd becausein contrast to the Frenchthe Russiansdisentangled themselves from these excessesand like Review 41 the English gave realism a superior beauty moved by the same moral spirit of a compassion cleansed of all impurities and glorified by the spirit of the gospels because of this De Vogue regards Russian realistic literature as the one force that can rejuvenate the literary art of the European nationsThe author writes with the authority of long study and gives us a sufficient basis for what we must now do ourselves namelyread comtemporary Russian literature and ask ourselves what it tells us whether or not it tells us that Christian realism is a contradiction in termsLLEWELLYX JONESA Drama of the Two Generations NowadaysA Contemporaneous Comedy in Three Actsby George Middleton Henry Holt and CompanyNew York Some little theatre company ought to send eight of its members on tour through all the smaller cities of the country in NowadaysIt would be the most effective way in the world to awaken the people of those slumbering places to the really amazing revolutions in contemporary life and incidentally in the contemporary theatreFor one thingit shows how parents and children are gradually bridging the foolish gulf between the generations the gulf that Shaw has called the degrading objection of youth to agefor anotherit reflects the extraordinary renaissance that has come to our theatre since the first visit of the Irish PlayersMrMiddleton takes a typical smalltown family a fathermothersonand daughter and leads them through a domestic crisis that has probably been the sad lot of most modern familiesThe daughterlike all proper young womenhas an ambition she wants to be a sculptorThe mother understandshaving had similar longings before she married a man who made it his business to suppress themThe father refuses to listen to the daughter s ideaand tells her that if she goes to New York it will be without his helpBut she goesand the play opens with her first visit homeThe sona weakling without ability of any sort except to spend money and sow wild oatshas also left home but he has managed to live very comfortably because of a monthly allowance from his fatherThe justice of the situation harks back to the antique theory that even a weak boy has more right to the splendors of the world than a girl of any typeDiana s father refuses to think about woman suffrageI don t have to think The Little Review about something I feelI tell youif we had woman suffragewomen would all vote like their husbands They say it would double the ignorant vote answers Diana s friendPeterthe journalistwho has encouraged her in rebelling He s a good natured old fossil Peter says later to DianaAnd when the girl insists that she loves her father anyhowPeter saysI love radishesbut they don t agree with meIf he had a new idea he d die of dropsy The result of Diana s visit is to produce certain rebellions in her motherwho goes back to New York with her to help make a home of that lonely little flatand to revive her own early ambitions as a painterLater the father succumbs to the new orderIt is all good comedy also it s tremendously good thinkingIf only it could be read by all the people who misunderstand the surging modern spirit that is riding so bravely through traditions and inheritancesBut Nowadays has another value besides that of its storyIt is made of the stuff of the new dramait fulfills our demand that the theatre shall give us the truth about life in a simple wayHoweverwe shall talk more about this in another issueOur MrWrenn and Us Our MrWrennby Sinclair Lewis Harper and BrothersNew York The poverty of American workaday criticism has rarely shown more threadbare than in the fact that of all the reviews of Our MrWrenna first novel by Sinclair Lewisa new authornot one has mentioned the idea under the bookThey have been good reviewstooas reviews goMany have praised the bookhave talked around itdescribed its charactersattempted to classify it under names so various as LockeWellsand DickensYet so expected is the novel that means nothingand so dead is critical visionthat no one has thought to say Here is a new American writerWhat is in his soulLet me prove the pointOur MrWrenn is a mouse like little clerk in the office of a New York novelty companyHe is called Our MrWrenn in business correspondence by the manager of the firmHe is overshadowed by the job He lives uncomfortably in MrsZapp s downtown boarding houseBecause the author can seevarious figures from the drab stream one meets in the street are made humanBecause the author has whimsicality and scorn and sympathythe book has humor and satire and pathosAll these things have been noted by the criticsMrWrenn is not always Our He becomes his own in the gorgeously illustrated travel leaflets sent out by steamship companiesEventually he does go to England on a cattle steamerHe is Bill Wrenn and licks a toughHe meets adventures Istraan over fine artist girl who likes him because he s realIn the end he pathetically sees her soar above him and sails back to Americawhere he goes into the office againfalls in love with a sweet little lingerie counter clerkmarriesand settles down All these things the critics have told usBut MrWrenn is at once glorious and patheticnot only because he says Gee when he has the emotions of a The Little Review poetIt isn t only the little things of the book that twist our smilesThere is an epic conflict between MrWrenn of the job and Bill Wrenn of the sunsets and the seaOur MrWrennoppressed and bulliedscuttling out of the waynot quite daring to think his own thoughts or dream his own dreamsnot knowing quite enough to understand the great things of the world this man is everywhere in New Yorkin Americahe is in our own soulsAnd when he musters courage to become Bill Wrennwhen he sets out on dangerous quests and loves strange beautyhe becomes a conqueror who rallies with him the great of historyand stands on the high places of our own spiritsPitifully inadequate Bill Wrenn isof courseThe lonely tragedy of that conventionally happy endinghas escaped the criticsThe drabthe commonplacecreep over Bill again without his knowing itThat s the frightful part of itIt s very like what appears to happen to everybodyOur MrWrenn he is at the endsunk in comfort and forgetting his flags in sunsetsIt is a poignantbitterly human novelAfter reading it in sympathy one cannot lean back in satisfaction and write commonplacesIt leads to understandings and resolutionsWhen we learn to demand such things of American writerstheir primary purpose will then cease to be either to entertain or to teach a lesson G ILBERT A LDENLantern Gleams Little Essays in Literature and Lifeby Richard Burton The Century CompanyNew York Readers of The Bellman will welcome in this permanent form many little lantern gleams of thought that have been shed athwart their path by this unacademically minded incumbent of a Minnesota chairMrBurton flashes his lamp fitfully over a large areaand shows us loitering spots as well as boggy ground it were well to avoidOpening his book at randomwe find here a hint on reading and here a warning gleam over some political or social morassWhen the morass is a deep onehoweverwe must not expect to sound its depths with a lantern gleamand so sometimes MrBurton disappoints usThus in discussing the individual and society he merely tells us what we all know that we pay for the advantage of socialityof mutual comfortand support bythe loss of individualityby the growth of a fear to do the thing that commends itself to our best judgmentBut what must we doMust we fill in this particular morass by throwing in all the individualsOr will the individuals be able to jump itMrBurton is discreet on such pointsMore satisfactory than that essay and others like it are those on literatureUnder Books and Men the author deplores the tendency which characterized Chaucer Farewell my books and my devotion of drawing an antithesis between men and booksbetween literature and lifeLiterature has its origin in life and its apparent separation from it is an accidental result

Carus The Open Court Publishing CompanyChicago Expositions of Nietzsche are usually written by uncritical disciples with little knowledge of formal philosophyIn so far as Nietzsche was a poetsome of these productions may be of value in spotsbut in so far as Nietzsche was an intellectual critic of life they are worthlessDrCarus writes from the standpoint of a philosopher in the most formal sense of that wordTo him Nietzsche the thundering voice of protest named Zarathustra is of less importance than Nietzsche the extreme nominalistThe chief value of his work therefore is purely informativeHe will certainly not send the philosophic debutante further into the matterEven from the purely informative sidehoweverDrCarus s work is delimited by his own attitudewhich is that of the old time believer in the validity of universalsRecurrenceuniformityeternal norms of things behind the changing phenomena are the foundations of DrCarus s stated or implied world viewHe therefore treats Nietzsche as simply a forerunner of suchto himmischievous people as William James and Henri BergsonHe takes great painsindeedto show that there are many Nietzschesand among them he classes George Mooreon the strength of extracts from his Confessions of a Young ManOf more value than that is his consideration of the philosophy of Stirnermainly because Stirner is not so well known as Nietzschenor so well as he deserves to be on his meritsOne undoubted merit the book hasand that is the industrious collection of personal recollections of Nietzsche and of Nietzsche portraits which DrCarus has brought together in its pagesThese will give the book a positive value to the Nietzsche enthusiastwhile the sight of DrCarus s coolscholastic temperament trying to drench the burning bush of Nietzsche will at least interest himIlliam DHONEFeminism and New Music Anthony the Absoluteby Samuel Merwin The Century CompanyNew York It is interesting to watch the struggles of an essentially chivalrous masculine soul caught in the whirlpool of modern feminismSamuel Merwinever since the old days of A Short Line War and Calumet K written in collaboration with Henry Kitchell Websterhas held towards women the attitude of the knight errantRecentlyas shown in The CitadelThe Charmed Life of Miss Austinand even more strongly in this latest bookAnthony the Absolutehe has become a determined feministBut the attitude has not changedFormerly his hero laid at the feet of the lady of his choice as much wealthfameand position as he could acquire this latest hero gives her in the same spirit a career and The Little Review the chance to develop her own personalityMrMerwin says The man who deliberately stops a woman s growth no matter what his traditions no matter what his fears for her is doing a monstrous thinga thing for which he must some day answer to the God of all life He is still the knight errantIt is still man who permits woman to developNone the less it is a very readable taleThe male characters are all clearly and convincingly drawnnot without humorThe lady is a little nebulousbut very charmingIllustrating the absoluteness of Anthony and serving as an introduction to the charming Heloise is an interesting musical themeThe scene is laid in Chinawhere Anthony is studying primitive musicand Heloise is able to sing for him a perfect close interval scalein eighth tones instead of thebarbaroushalf and whole tones of the piano scaleUnfortunately MrMerwin has permitted himself to be led by the exigencies of a popular magazinein which the story appeared in serial forminto giving the tale a certain meretricious air of sex allurement which it fundamentally does not possessOn the wholeexcept in a certain technical facility in handling the situations and sustaining the tension of the plotAnthony the Absolute is a decided falling below the really splendid standard of excellence which MrMerwin set for himself in The CitadelEUNICE TIETJENSOf all our

lawT are The Little Review ignorant postal clerksclergymen of archaic convictionsand lower court judges of the tobacco chewingcorner saloon type to whom any thought of sex is necessarily nastyBut behind them is the man who is always saying that such and such a book or play oughtn t to be allowed He is always wanting to protect the young or somebody elsealthough he rarely reads books himselfand probably would resent interference with his own often vicious pleasuresHis mind is essentially rottenHe is incapable of understanding the pure beauty of the human bodybecause he has seen so many musical comedies He would be shocked by the statement that passion is a beautiful element of nature toward which we should be reverentHe has a sense of proprietynot so much about what should be done as about what should be saidAnd then there is the vast Florence Barclay contingentlargely womenwhobecause they don t know what the world is likedon t want to knowand don t think anybody should be allowed to knowThe trouble with censorship is that we always want it to apply to other peoplenever to ourselvesIt is our national weakness that we try to prescribe conduct by lawinstead of seeing that the individual is strong and truth seeingand leaving conduct to take care of itselfallowing ideas to fight their own battlesIf we must have a censorshiplet it be in the hands of the strong and

the rest of usas they try to drag us down from the rain washed skies of the morning to their stuffy hair cloth religion and pink candy pleasuresThe fight between the writers and the censors is sure to

with us an army awakened to the true issues of art and lifeWilliam Butler Yeats to American Poets The current number of Poetry prints a speech that William Butler Yeats made during his recent visit to Chicagoin which he took occasion to warn his confreres in America against a number of besetting sinsHe saidin partTwenty five years ago a celebrated writer from South Africa said she lived in the East End of London because only there could she see the faces of people without a maskTo this Oscar Wilde replied that he lived in the West End because nothing interested him but the maskAfter a week of lecturing I am too tired to assume a maskso I will address my remarks especially to a fellow craftsmanFor since coming to Chicago I have read several times a poem by MrLindsayone which will be in the anthologiesGeneral Booth Enters Into HeavenThis poem is stripped bare of ornamentit has an earnest simplicitya strange beautyand you know Bacon saidThere is no excellent beauty without strangeness I have lived a good many years and have read many writersWhen I was younger than MrLindsayand was beginning to write in Irelandthere was all around me the rhetorical poetry 48 The Little of the Irish politiciansWe young writers rebelled against that rhetoricthere was too much of it and to a great extent it was meaninglessWhen I went to London I found a group of young lyric writers who were also against rhetoricWe formed the RhymersClubwe used to meet and read our poems to one anotherand we tried to rid them of rhetoricBut nowwhen I open the ordinary American magazineI find that all we rebelled against in those early days the sentimentalitythe rhetoricthemoral upliftstill exists hereNot because you are too far from Englandbut because you are too far from ParisIt is from Paris that nearly all the great influences in art and literature have comefrom the time of Chaucer until nowToday the metrical experiments of French poets are overwhelming in their variety and delicacyThe best English writing is dominated by French criticismin France is the great critical mindThe Victorians forgot thisalsothey forgot the austerity of art and began to preachWhen I saw Paul Verlaine in Parishe told me that he could not translate Tennyson because he wastoo Anglaistoo noble when he should be broken hearted he has too many reminiscencesWe in Englandour little group of rhymerswere weary of all thisW e wanted to get rid not only of rhetoric but of poetic dictionWe tried to strip away everything that was artificialto get a style like speechas simple as the simplest proselike a cry of the heartReal enjoyment of a beautiful thing is not achieved when a poet tries to teachIt is not the business of a poet to instruct his ageHe should be too humble to instruct his ageHis business is merely to express himselfwhatever that self may beI would have all American Review poets keep in mind the example of Francois VillonSo you who are readers should encourage American poets to strive to become very simplevery humbleYour poet must put the fervor of his life into his workgiving you his emotions before the worldthe evil with the goodnot thinking whether he is a good man or a bad manor whether he is teaching youA poet does not know whether he is a good manIf he is a good manhe probably thinks he is a bad manPoetry that is naturally simplethat might exist as the simplest proseshould have instantaneousness of effectprovided it finds the right audienceYou may have to wait years for that audiencebut when it is found that instantaneousness of effect is producedWe rebelled against rhetoricand now there is a group of younger poets who dare to call us rhetoricalWhen I returned to London from IrelandI had a young man go over all my work with me to eliminate the abstractThis was an American poetEzra PoundMuch of his work is experimentalhis work will come slowlyhe will make many an experiment before he comes into his ownI should like to read to you two poems of permanent valueThe Ballad of the Goodly Fere and The ReturnThis last isI thinkthe most beautiful poem that has been written in the free formone of the few in which I find real organic rhythmA great many poets use vers libre because they think it is easier to write than rhymed versebut it is much more difficultThe whole movement of poetry is toward picturessensuous imagesaway from rhetoricfrom the abstracttoward humilityBut I fear I am now becoming rhetoricalI have been driven into Irish public life how can I avoid rhetoric The Little Letters to The What an insouciant little pagan paper you nourish before our

splendid note I hope no criticism will influence you to change itYou agreeevidentlywith the point that The Dark Flower suggests a Greek classicso do IButconceding thathow could you have been surprised that countless people care nothing for itDon t you know that the majority of people in the world do not really possess the Greek classicsWithout the background of the world s thoughtages agoand its progress unless we agree with Alfred Russell Wallace that we have made no progress can t you see that The Dark Flower could genuinely startle many peopleSo I beg for less sharpness toward those who do not feel the wonder of itThe tragedy is in their livesFor just the same reason Jean Christophe belongs to a fewcomparativelyIf you had never before felt the power of a great epiccould you really grasp this oneModern as we claim to be and independent must there not be some foundationOh dearI do want to tell you why I think Vanity Fair is greater than Succession and why Ysaye s music is inspired when I listenat leastBut one can t go on foreverSince the CriticsCritic expressed a doubt about that quotation from Euripides and since you insisted that it sounded like a Gilbert Murray translationyou may be glad to know that it is bothBut you quoted it wrongIt is from Aeolusa lost playand this is the correct version This CyprianShe is a thousandthousand changing thingsShe brings more pain than any godshe brings More joyI cannot judge herMay it be An hour of mercy when she looks on meI do agree that a millionmillion changing things is somehow more perfectI even agree nowthough not at firstwith the order of attributes She brings more joy than any godshe brings more pain On a re reading of Aeolus I am taken with the way you misquoted itJoy was surely first in the Greek s lifeAnd of course the human beauty of the thing made me think immediately of the way MrsBrowning struck off Euripides Our Euripidesthe humanWith his droppings of warm tears And his touches of things common Till they rose to touch the spheresKATHERINE TAPPERTDavenportIowa I don t know when I ve read anything so inspiring as that letter from GalsworthyCan t all of you who are helping to make the magazine arrange to march up to it mentally and present yourcopy for approval before you decide to print itI like the article on Paderewski and the one about The Dark FlowerBut do be careful ofbeautyandpassion The Little Review It s easy to make them commonplaceAlso spare your adjectives a bityou don t need an adjective for everythingrealize that your abbreviations are made in the interest of readablenessbut however informal you want to make it you only succeed in sounding hideously colloquialIt doesn t read welland it makesme feel that you re trying to achieve through the style what ought to be achieved quite simply through the material itselfNot that I approve of anything stiltedbut you can easily overdo the other side of itAnd wouldn t it be better to leave some of the things unsignedPeople who don t know that the various Anderson contributors are unrelated will think it s rather a family monopolyThe Ficke poems are exquisite and how I love Nicholas Vachel Lindsay sAlso I like the New York letter very muchbut George Soule s Major Symphony could just as well be unwrittenPoetry has to be so much better than that to be real poetryAnother thingI think your quotations from Succession weren t as efficient as you hopedIt s a book that can t well be quoted except to one who knows itYou wanted franknessso here it isOtherwiseI have nothing but praise for the whole glorious undertaking Lois ALLEN PETERSPhiladelphia Being a sister of the editorMrsPeters speaks her mind with a freedom that enchants usIt also helps us though we want to shake her for one or two of those remarksHowever may her letter serve as a model to timid but opinionated readers THE EDITOR If you will allow me to be perfectly frank about your first issueI should like to tell you that THE LITTLE REVIEW seems rather too esthetic in tone and spirit to avoid being restrictivea wish you expressed in your editorialThere is not enough variety in itfor one thingFor anothersome of its critical judgments are too personal are too largely temperamental judgments to be of any permanent valueYou seem to have set out to exploit personalitiesand there s a juvenility in many of the articles that I m afraid you ll all blush for in ten yearsA WELL MEANING CRITICThe first number of THE LITTLE REVIEW came as a delightfulsurprise and I have enjoyed reading itI particularly appreciate the spirit of appreciation running through the pageswhich I believe will be of inestimable service to young writersif you are able to keep it upMKNew YorkTHE LITTLE REVIEW looks very interestingI hope to have the pleasure of reading it through very soonbut at the moment my small sister is devouring it and refuses absolutely to give it upIf you are as successful in pleasing women generally as you have been in pleasing her you need have no fear for the success of the magazineJCPNew YorkProfessor Foster s essay on The Prophet of a New Culture is magnificent a soul searchingheart breaking bit of writingfiery and tragicNicholas Vachel

Review TH E LITTLE REVIEW came to hand promptlybut I was unable to read it until last nightThat is where I made my first mistakeas I had been denying myself a very pleasant two hoursM y second mistake was in having read it at allas it has now become one of those eight or ten journals which are always welcome and more or less necessaryTen journals each monthand some weeklies quietly yet insistently urging me to take them upare like those good friends who tempt me with an outing in Spring when work is crowdingSo with TH E LITTLE REVIEWIt has with one reading become a distinctly individual friendW

emotion that brings the tears and makes the sobs struggle in the back of your throat is always worth living throughand I wouldn t have missed it for worldsWith the best of good wishesMABEL REBERChicagoI want to tell you how very good the first issue of TH E LITTLE REVIEW isI don t know what the succeeding numbers will be likebut you have set a place in this one that will demand some vigorous effort to keep upAfter thatgrippingannouncement no one will doubt the real purpose of the REVIEW and the fine optimism that is behind itI don t have to believe everything you are going to printbut if those who write it doby The Little Review all means keep them togetherAnd don t let George Soule get awayIt s too early to make suggestionsbut I should say that Number One is well balanced and very readableand I like the trick of throwing the light on from different angles like the Galsworthy and Nietzsche discussionsThe tone is highand I am quite sure I never read more intelligent reviews anywhereGood luck to THE LITTLE REVIEW JDMARNEYSpringfieldI11Will you let me thank you for giving me a very pleasant experience in reading the first copy of THE LITTLE Review There are many
