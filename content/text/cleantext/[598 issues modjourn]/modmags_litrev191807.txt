and it was SpringHow the wine ran through the little greedy half dead swarming in the streetsYesthose endlessbobbingfaces almost looked at eachotheralmost smiled into each other s eyes insufferable and inhumanbreach of democracyBut there was something immoral about thedayThe music of dreams tugged at the endless shuffling feetThe music of desires little starved and fearful things come out for a moment in the sun and wind piped vainly for dancersThere was something vague and bewildered about the buildings and the people as if there was a great undying shout in the streetsWhat a panic this monotonous return of Spring breeds among the little half dead as they shuffle and bob along with a tingle in their heels and a blindness come suddenly into their eyesFor it is through the mists of The Little Review 13 greedy complacencies that the little half dead are able to pick their steps with certainty and precisionNow comes this wine and this music and this disturbance as of a great undying shout sweeping the bristling shafts of stoneand the mists vanish for a momentIn the blindness which falls upon them is an undertow tugging at their feetI stood on the corner that day observing how in the spring the bodies of women were like the bodies of longlithe animals prowling under orange and lavendergreen and torquoise dresses and how the men with their coats dangling across their arms were like hot beetles that had removed their shellsBut as I watched the endless faces filled with half startled and half placid confusionand as I noted what the poets call the gayety of spring in the hearts of menthere came to me out of the swarm and roar of the day the mockery which it is theduty of philosophers to hearFor I had seen two men hanged and had most properly come away a philospherWhere was he who might have been crawling along the treadmill of time lighted today for another instant by the springThe creature who had spat at the cross on the scaffoldwhose perfect tusks had grinned out of the gloom above our heads an hour agoLaughing in Hellif death makes men wiseFor Hell is a place of wise laughterAnd the other onewho had died vomiting terrorThere was a group of us waiting patiently for the tall steel doors of the jail to openRighteous men we were with stern cold faces come to transact with proper dignity certain grave business in the interest of the little greedy half dead who even here shuffled through the streets with the lie of Spring in their heelsAnd after we had been admitted and our credentials cunningly examinedwe were marched through barred corridors and told to enter a door and make ourselves comfortable insideWithin this door stretched the room which was to witness the hangingsIt was a long and narrow room with towering wallsIt could have been built only for one purposeas a room in which to hang menThe grey plaster of its walls was unrelieved by any humanizing designThey formedthese wallsa geometrical monotone unbroken by windows or doors except the one through which we had enteredThe floor was of stoneForty long benches such as picnickers use in groveshad been introduced into this vault of a roomThey seemed puny wooden toys under the sweep and stretch of the toweringslot like wallsWe came walking slowly into the roomWe were doctorspublic offi 14 The Little Review cialsjail attendants and newspaper menWe sat down on the benches and faced the allowsThe timber of the gallows reached from the stone floor to the darkforgotten ceilingFifteen feet above the floor was a platformOn this platform the men who were to be hanged were to stand until a part of its floor which was on hinges swung back and dropped themThen they would be left dangling from the ropesThese ropes hung now from a cross beam fifteen feet above the floor of the platformThey were two bright yellow manilla ropesEach ended in a noose the size of a man s headWe on the benches stared with uncomfortable eyes at these ropesIn the gloom our faces floated like little pale discs above the benchesThe ends of cigars and cigarettes made tiny red spots in the darkness and above our heads little grey and violet parasols of smoke opened and vanishedThey were eager and efficient ropes and they had personalityThey becamewhen we had scrutinized them for a long spacethe strange and attenuated furniture entirely suited to this roomAbout their slim and elegant stretch there was something monstrous suggestedThings which are sometimes seen in a fever assume the grotesque dimensions of these ropesPeople do not think in these placesThey sit with their mouths somewhat parted and smoke cigars and nod politely to each other as they talkThey stare about them as do children in a strange housenoting this and observing thatIndeedit was not till an hour later that I became a philosopher and found it necessary to adjust adjectivesThere were two men on the scaffold platformOne was a stout man with snow colored hairHe was well dressed but we noticed with grave smiles that he seemed unduly conscious of his freshly shined patent leather shoesHe kept moving them about and we watched them closely like so many cats in the dark might watch two bewildered miceAt length achieving a comparative equanimity under our gazehe thrust his hands behind him and stood stiffly facing the ropesThere was nothing left to think of about hinr other than that he was fat The other man was a jail guardThen we noticed simultaneously a little box like shack which stood against the plaster wall at the rear of the gallowsplatformIt was just large enough to accommodate a manWe remarked in stern sophisticated whispers to each other that the man who sprung The Little Review the trap under the feet of the men about to hang was hidden in this enclosureFor a space we stared at a small circular window in the gallows shackdiverted by banal speculationHow did this man feel who actually did the thing which killed two menAs we stared a facevague and darkappeared in the little window and then vanishedWe were contentand here and there in the gloom matches were struck and the faces of men lighting cigars remained in glowing prints upon the dark airSuddenlyas if greatly ahead of timemen started entering the room from the single door at the side of the gallowsThree public officials walked firstBehind them walked two priests in white and purple surplicesBetween the two priests was a young man with a colorless faceHe was in his shirt sleeves and without a collarHe looked as if he had been interrupted washing dishesFollowing these were several jail guardsWe did not count their numberBehind the guards walked two priests in white and purple surplicesBetween them walked the second manFor the first man without a collar who walked between the two priests we had no eyesThere was about him a lack of something which made him akin to us on the benchesHe stopped and wobbled and his head rolled and from his lips issued a moan Oh my Lord Jesus Christ he saidHis lips as he walked were peeled back in the manner of a man suffering from nauseaWe did not look long at himBut the other we stared and watched and forgot to puff on our cigarsHe was a man with gaunt features and the face of an unbarbered Caesarlined and hollowed like the wing of a batHe had a lean and muscular neck and he walked high shouldered like an EgyptianTo the drooping lines of his mouth and chin clung a dark curling covering of hair like the beard on the paintings of the adolescent ChristHe walked with his jaw thrust forwardlean and hollow jaws like the jaws of a starving monkHis eyesround and blacknestled deep in his headblack and burning like the eyes of a voodoo priestWe watched this man and moved about on our benchesWe knew his name and the deeds he had done in the worldHe had moved among the little greedy half dead with altogether curious inspirationsAt night he had flattened himself against dark alley walls and waited with a gun in his hand for men to approach himThe Little Review and he had gone prowling after them like a stoical coyote crept into the city out of the darkness beyondThus he had grown rich and careless and taken to darting through the streets by day as he had done by nightIn the sun there came into his heart a joyous hate which had misguided himIt caused him finally to stand upon a street corner shouting and shooting into the swarm of things about him until the street grew lonely and strangely rid of all sounds but the whoop of his voice and the little bark of his gunIt was very sadfor the little heaped figures that lay strewn in the emptied street might have been our wives and our mothersEventually a tall red faced man bristling with gold buttonspounced upon him from the rear and held him as he continued to shout and wave a useless gun toward the high roofs of the crowd d buildingsHere he was walking up the slim wooden stairs that lead to the gallows platformand here he was standing under the looped rope that dangled at his ear and beside another man who continued to moan My Lord Jesus Christforgive meForgive us all But we did not look at this oneThe platform was now crowded with men but we did not look at themThey came forward with long black straps and proceeded to bind the man who was moaningThen a priest came forward and stood beside the man who was moaning and rested an ivory crucifix upon his lips and opened a book under his rolling eyesBut our eyesheld as by some vast thing about to happenthat will any minute happenremained upon the gauntunbarbered face with its Christ like beardwith the mystic snarl in its eyesof the man who stood under the other ropeAn inexplicable fascination held our eyes upon himAnd under our unblinking stares he grew and grew and became lopsided and out of focus and the features of his face swam apart into the grimace of a man laughingThen our eyes cleared and we saw that his arms were strapped flat against his sides and his legs strapped tightly together at the ankles and the kneesand that a priest in a white and purple surplice with a startled face was offering an ivory crucifix for him to kissWe watched him look at the crucifixhis eyes becoming filled with yellow lightsand watched his lips peel back and the teethexaggerated in their nakednessshine in a grinSuddenly he closed his mouth and spat at the crucifixBeside him the man under the rope was moaningOh my CreatorLet me seeLet me see And his head wab The Little Review 17 bled toward the opened book the priest in front of him held to his eyesOf this we were conscious in an uninterested wayFor a man had spat upon a crucifix and there was that in us which made us lower our heads and tremble and move uneasilyOther men stepped forward on the gallows platform and hung long white robes upon the two under the ropesThe robes fastened in a pucker about their necks and fell to the floor and were fastened in another pucker about their anklesThen a man with unbelievable gestures slipped the rope over the head of the moaning one and drew the noose tight with unbelievable little jerks so that the knot fell under the man s ear Oh Lord Jesus Christmy Jesus Christforgive meForgive us allmoaned the manhis face almost vanishing in the gloomAbout the neck of the other whom we were watchingas men watching something about to explodethe second rope was fixed and jerked into placeAnd then a voice shot from the platformIt came from the blur and flurry of men grouped behind the ropes Have you anything to say it inquiredA cry answered from the one who was moaningHis words blurred and buzzing filled the room Oh my Creatormy Creator he sang I am going to my Creator And the man with the face that was linecTand hollowed like the wing of a bat remained silentgazing with his glowing eyes down upon our headsIn his puckered white robe he loomed out of the gloom like some grotesque and stoical sage in masqueradeexcept for his teeth which were bared and swimming in salivaThe faces above the ropes remained visible for several instantsTwo men bearing white masks then approached themThe one who moaned was rolling his eyes up and down the towering gloomy walls as if in frantichelpless searchThe other was staring down upon us in a strangedisinterested mannerhis lips peeling backhis jaws thrusting forwardHe drew a long breath and then vanished behind the white mask with a secret in his eyesBoth men had disappearedThere were to be seen only two long white bundles curiously shapelessWe were silentThe moaning of the man who had kissed the crucifixsuddenly resumedIt filled the roomIt came louder and louder from the depths of the long white bundlecrawling ovems and along the towering walls that had no windowsFrom the other white bundle came silenceThe feet 18 The Little Review under it stared at us without movementThe moaning burst into wordsOh My Creatorand was lost in a crashThe trap had banged downA great swaying howl rolled into the vault like roomIt swept like a curtain between us and the two white bundles that had shot through the trapThe two men were hangingThe howling came from the prisoners in the cells beyond in the jailhowling like the sustained cry of an army out of a wildernessThe two white bundles that were hangingstirredOne of them turned slightlywith a certain idlenessThe other began to expand and contractA curious animation gradually took possession of itSeveral minutes passed and the white bundles continued to bob and twitchThe one to the left which contained the man who had moaned began now to throb and quiver like a plucked and vibrating violin stringThe rope above it hummedfilling the room with the whang of its monotoneThe other bundle remained turning idlyA large group of men had risen from the benches in frontSeveral of them held black stethescopes in their handsThey waitedThe rest of us stood to our feetThere was silence and the moments passed with our eyes unwaveringThe two bundles seemed mysteriously wound up as if they would go on turning idly foreverThen they began to act as if someone were trying to blow them up from insideBetween the masks and the puckered tops of the white robes the necks of the two men hanging within the bundles became visibleSuddenly the turning ceased and the two bundles began to behave as if someone were jerking with an amazing violence on the ropes which supported them in mid airThey executed a frenzied and staccato jigThe bundles hung motionless at the ends of the two ropeslimp dead bannersout of which the wind had diedA physician removing the stethescope from his ears said something that ended with the words twelve minutes A second physician repeated what he had saidWe crowded forward from the benchesgathering about the two figures which had dropped their white robesThey were no longer interestingA certain fascination had gone out of themput of the ropesout of the tallspectral timbers of the gallowsWe passed them a few minutes later on our way out of the doorThey were lying on two wheel cotsTheir masks had been removed and The Little Review their faces colored like stained glass watched us with mouths openedI had forgotten my hatWe had moved into the lobby of the jail and I hurried back after my hatI stood for a moment gazing at the towering grey wallsthe wood structurethe two strands of rope that dropped from the beamThey had been cutThere was no

the gallery SEEDS Sherwood Anderson THERE was a Doctor from Johns Hopkins talked to me one day last summer concerning modern life and its universal insanityHe was a small man with a beard and was very nervousI remember how the cords of his neck were drawn tautThe Doctor with his tight drawn nerves and a peculiar eagei sadness in his bearing sat beside me late one afternoon on the steps of a farm house by a lake in the mountainsHe talked of his workFor years he had been trying to cure people of illness by the method called psychoanalysisThe idea was the passion of his life I came here because I am tired he said dejectedly My body is not tired but something inside me is old and worn outI want joyFor a few days or weeks I would like to forget men and women and the influences that make them the sick things they are The man s voice became tense and shrillThere is a note that comes into the human voice by which you may know real wearinessIt comes to the writer when he has been trying with all his heart and soul to think his way along some difficult road of thoughtOf a sudden he finds himself unable to go onSomething within him stopsA tiny explosion takes placeHe bursts into words and talksperhaps foolishlyLittle side currents of his nature he didn t know run out and get themselves expressedIt is at such times that a man boastsuses big wordsmakes a fool of himself in general Much of literature has been written on the shrill high plane on which these explosions take place and I suspect most of our poetryAnd so it was that the doctor became shrillHe jumped up from the steps and walked about You go on quietlyhe saidturning to look at me I can feel it in youYou come from the WestYou have kept away from peopleYou have preserved yourself damn youI haven tHis voice had indeed become shrill I have entered into livesI have gone beneath the The LittleReview 2S surface of the lives of men and womenWomen especially I have studied our own womenhere in AmericaYou have loved them I suggested Perhaps that s your troubleThat is sometimes the troubleYes he said more quietly Yes you are right thereI have done thatIt is the only way I can get at thingsI have to try to loveYou see how that isIt is the only wayLove must be the beginning of things with meThere is understanding in that He was irritated and I began to sense the depths of his weariness Let s not talk of the matterI urged We will go swim in the lakeI don t want to swim or do any plodding thingI want to run and shout he declared For awhilefor a few hoursI want to be like a dead leaf blown by the winds over these hillsI have one desire and one onlyto free myself We walked in a dusty country roadI wanted him to know that I thought I understood so I put the case in my own way Let me state the matter quite honestly I began I want to abuse you a little When he stopped and staged at me I went on You are no more and no better than myself I declared You are a dog that has rolled in offal and because you are not quite a dog you do not like the smell of your own hideIn turn my voice became shrill You blind fool I cried impatiently Men like you are foolsYou cannot go along that roadIt is given to no man to venture far along the road of lives I became passionately in earnest The illness you pretend to cure is the universal illness I said The thing you want to do cannot be doneFool do you expect love to be understood We stood in the dusty road and looked at each otherThe suggestion of a sneer played about the corners of his mouthHe put a hand on my shoulder and shook me How smart we areHow aptly we put things He spat the words out and then turned and walked a little away You think you understand but you don t understand he cried What you say can t be done can be doneYou are a liarYou cannot be so definite without missing something vague and fineYou miss the whole pointThe lives of people are like young trees in a forestThey are being choked1 by climbing vinesThe vines are old thoughts and beliefs planted by dead menI am myself cov 26 The Little Review ered by crawling creeping vines that choke me He laughed bitterly And that s why I want to run and playhe said I want to be a leaf blown by the wind over hillsI want to die and be born again and I am only a tree covered with vines and slowly dyingI amyou seeweary and want to be made cleanI am an amateur venturing timidly into lives he concluded I am weary and want to be made cleanI am covered by creepingcrawling things There was a woman from Iowa came here to Chicago and took a room in a house on the west sideShe was about twenty seven years old and ostensibly she came to the city to study advanced methods for teaching musicA certain young man lived in the west side house with herHis room faced a long hall on the second floor of the house and the one taken by the woman was across the hall facing his roomIn regard to the young man there is something very sweet in his natureHe is a painter but I have often wished he would decide to become a writerHe tells things with understanding and he does not paint brilliantlyAnd so the woman from Iowa lived in the west side house and came home from the city in the eveningShe looked like a thousand other women one sees in the streets every dayThe only thing that at all made her stand out among the women in the crowds was that she was a little lameHer right foot was slightly deformed and she walked with a limpFor three months she lived in the housewhere she was the only woman except the landlady and then a feeling in regard to her began to grow up among the men of the houseThe men all said the same thing concerning herWhen they met in the hall way at the front of the house they stoppedlaughed and whispered She wants a loverthey said and winked She may not know it but a lover is what she needs One knowing Chicago and Chicago men would think that an easy want to be satisfiedI laughed when my friend whose name is LeRoy told me the storybut he did not laughHe shook his head It wasn t so easyhe said There would be no story were the matter that simple Le Roy tried to explainWhenever a man approached her she The Little Review 27 became alarmed he said Men kept smiling and speaking to her They invited her to dinner and to the theatre but nothing would induce her to walk in the streets with a manShe never went into the streets at nightWhen a man stopped and tried to talk with her in the hallway she turned her eyes to the floor and then ran into her roomOnce a young drygoods clerk who lived there induced her to sit with him on the steps before the houseHe was a sentimental fellow and took hold of her handWhen she began to cry he was alarmed and aroseHe put a hand on her shoulder and tried to explain but under the touch of his fingers her whole body shook with terror Don t touch me she cried Don t let your hands touch me She began to scream and people passing in the street stopped to listenThe drygoods clerk was alarmed and ran upstairs to his own roomHe bolted the door and stood listening It is a trick he declared in a trembling voice She is trying to make troubleI did nothing to herIt was anaccident and anyway what is the matterI only touched her arm with my fingers Perhaps a dozen times LeRoy has spoken to me of the experience of the Iowa woman in the west side houseThe men there began to hate herAlthough she would have nothing to do with them she would not let them aloneIn a hundred ways she continually invited approaches that when made she repelledWhen she stood naked in the bathroom facing the hallway where the men passed up and down she left the door slightly ajarThere was a couch in the living room down stairs and when men were present she would sometimes enter and without saying a word throw herself down before themOn the couch she lay with lips drawn slightly apartHer eyes stared at the ceilingHer whole physical being seemed to be waiting for somethingThe sense of her filled the roomThe men standing about pretended not to seeThey talked loudlyEmbarrassment took possession of them and one by one they crept quietly awayOne evening the woman was ordered to leave the houseSomeoneperhaps the drygoods clerkhad talked to the landlady and she acted at once If you leave tonight I shall like it that much better LeRoy heard the elder woman s voice sayingShe stood in the hallway before the Iowa woman s roomThe landlady s voice rang through the house28 The Little Review LeRoy the painter is tall and lean and his life has been spent in devotion to ideasThe passions of his brain have consumed the passions of his bodyHis income is small and he has not marriedPerhaps he has never had a sweetheartHe is not without physical desire but he is not primarily concerned with desireOn the evening when the Iowa woman was ordered to leave the west side house she waited until she thought the landlady had gone downstairsand then went into LeRoy s roomIt was about eight o clock and he sat by a window reading a bookThe woman did not knock but opened the doorShe said nothing but ran across the floor and knelt at his feetLeRoy said that her twisted foot made her run like a wounded birdthat her eyes were burning and that her breath came in little gasps Take me she saiddropping her face down upon his knees and trembling violently Take me quickThere must be a beginning to thingsI can t stand the waitingYou must take me at once You may be quite sure LeRoy was perplexed by all thisFrom what he has said I gathered that until that evening he had hardly noticed the womanI suppose that of all the men in the house he had been the most indifferent to herIn the room something happenedThe landlady followed the woman when she ran to LeRoy and the two women confronted himThe woman from Iowa knelt trembling and frightened at his feetThe landlady was indignantLeRoy acted on impulseAn inspiration came to himPutting his hand on the kneeling woman s shoulder he shook her violently Now behave yourself he said quickly I will keep my promise He turned to the landlady and smiled We have been engaged to be married he said We have quarreledShe came here to be near me and to help me decideShe has been unwell and excitedI will take her awayPlease don t let yourself be annoyedI will take her away When the woman and LeRoy got out of the house she stopped weeping and put her hand into hisHer fears had all gone awayHe found a room for her in another house and then went with her into a park and sat down on a benchEverything LeRoy has told me concerning this woman strengthens belief in what I said to the Johns Hopkins man that day in the mountainsYou cannot venture along the road of livesOn The Little Review 29 the bench he and the woman talked until midnight and he saw and talked with her many times laterNothing came of itShe went backI supposeto her place in the WestIn the place from which she had come the woman had been a teacher of musicShe was one of four sistersall engaged in the same sort of work andLe Roy saysall quiet capable womenTheir father had died when the eldest girl was not yet tenand five years laterthe mother died alsoThe girls had a house and a gardenIn the nature of things I cannot know what the lives of the women were like but of this one may be quite sure they talked only of women s affairsthought only of women s affairsNo one of them ever had a loverFor years no man came near the houseOf them all only the younger the one who came to Chicagowas in any way affected by the utterly feminine quality of their livesIt did something to herAll day and every day she taught music to young girls and then went home to the womenWhen she was twenty five she began to think and to dream of menDuring the day and through the evening she talked with women of women s affairsand all the time she wanted desperately to be loved by a manShe went to Chicago with that hope in mindLe Roy explained her attitude in the matter and her strange behavior in the west side house by saying she had thought too much and acted too little The life force within her became decentralized he declared What she wanted and she could not achieveThe living force within could not find expressionWhen it could not get expressed in one way it took anotherSex spread itself out over her bodyIt permeated the very fibre of her beingAt the last she was sex personifiedsex become condensed and impersonalCertain wordsthe touch of a man s handsometimes even the sight of a man passing in the street did something to herYesterday I saw LeRoy and he talked to me againof the woman and her strange and terrible fateWe walked by the lake in the parkAs we went along the figure of the woman kept coming into my mindAn idea came to me You might have been her lover I said That was possibleShe was not afraid of you Le Roy stoppedLike the doctor who was so sure of his ability to walk into lives he grew angry and scoldedFor a moment he 30 The Little Review stared at me and then a rather odd thing happenedWords said by that other man in the dusty road in the hills came into LeRoy s mouth and were said over againThe suggestion of a sneer played about the corners of Le Roy s mouth How smart we areHow aptly we put things he saidThe voice of the young man who walked with me in the park by the lake in the city became shrillI sensed the weariness in himThen he laughed and said quietly and softly It isn t so simpleBy being sure of yourself you are in danger of losing all of the romances of lifeYou miss the whole pointNothing in life can be settled so definitelyThe woman don t you see was like a young tree choked by a climbing vineThe thing that wrapped her about had shut out the lightShe was as grotesque as many trees in the forest are grotesquesHer problem was such a difficult one that thinking of it has changed the whole current of my lifeAt first I was like youI was quite sureI thought I would be her lover and settle the matter Le Roy turned and walked a little awayThen he came back and took hold of my armA passionate earnestness took possession of himHis voice trembled She needs a loveryesthe men in the house were quite right about that he said She needed a lover and at the same time a lover was not what she neededThe need of a lover wasafter alla quite secondary thingShe needed to be lovedto be long and quietly and patiently lovedTo be sure she is a grotesquebut then all the people in the world are grotesquesWe all need to be lovedWhat would cure her would cure the rest of us alsoThe disease she had isyou seeuniversalWe all want to be loved and the world has no plan for creating our lovers Le Roy s voice dropped and he walked beside me in silenceWe turned away from the lake and walked under treesI looked closely at himThe cords of h s neck were drawn taut I have seen under the shell of life and I am afraid he mused I am myself like the womanI am covered with creeping crawling vine like thingsI cannot be a loverI am not subtle or patient enoughI am paying old debtsOld thoughts and beliefs seeds planted by dead men spring up in my soul and choke me For a long time we walked and LeRoy talked voicing the thoughts that came to his mindI listened in silenceHis mind struck upon the refrain voiced by the man in the mountains I would like to be The Little Review 3ia dead dry thing he muttered looking at the leaves scattered over the grass I would like to be a leaf blown by the wind He looked up and his eyes turned to where among the trees we could see the lake in the distance I am weary and want to be made cleanI am a man covered by creeping crawling thingsI would like to be dead and blown by the wind over limitless waters he said I want more than anything else in the world to be cleanSAPTAM EDOYARDER SVARGABOHAN IGonne WE HAVE been accustomed lately to connect Bengali literature chiefly with lyric poetry and religious proseperhaps even to the exclusion of more powerful formsYet the spirit which produced the Ramayana and the Mahabharata has not passed away from the descendants of ValmikiMrTPJyotishi s poem stands as a triumphant and decisive assertion of this factIn this fine workperhaps the last great epic of our timesthe author has not attempted to revive the doings of ancient heroesnor is the impetuosity of emotion delayed and hindered by a tedious eruditionYet while dealing with a modern subject he has not forgotten tradition which enobles and makes permanent all great productionso throughout the poem Gods are seen descending on earth as of yore to minister speeches and solace to the mortals The Ascension of Edward VII to Heaven under its titleSaptam Edoyarder Svargabohan first appeared in Calcutta in 1911 in Bengali with a short prose rendering in EnglishBut this copyhowever revealing it may have been to the Indian worldwas hardly adequate for the WestThe translationit is truedid its best to render the dramatic value of the pieceand in many passages almost succeededbut an abbreviated prose translation could notsucceed in reproducing the full rich style of the Bengali versesFor instanceThe Little Review The Duke and Duchess of Fife seem lifelesshardly conveys to us the power of the originalNeither does Queen Mary shed tearscompare with Here and there the rendering is more felicitius as in the lines Ohwhat is the queen of Heaven s Beauty by the side of the personal charm of England s Queen Yet again how poor this appears confronted withShortly after the publication of this first volume there appeared a verse translation by a Bengali whose nameI regret to say does not figure on the title pageThisbesides being a faithful expression of the textpossesses as well literary merits of its own which should have made the author less desirous to preserve his incognitoIt may not be superfluous now to give a short account of the piece as it stands both in the verse and in the prose translationThe book begins with a song to the glory of Britain Let us sing of her vast literatureof her grand philosophyof her splendid architecture and of her great musicians After this prelude the scene opens in the palace of the God IndraTo the assembled gods he is describing a dream from which he has just awakenedIn this dream he had been paying a visit to the King of England In that land of men and women simple in appearancesympathetic in natureand truly religious Then follows a talk in which Indra praises the King and his kingdomThe Little ReviewBoruthe God of the Ocean is now your slave and is never so happy as when he dances with your dreaded Dreadnaughtson his bosom Then he enjoins the King to come with him to HeavenAfter a moment of somewhat excusable hesitationthe King acceptsHere ends the dream of Indrabut just as he has done relating it the air is filled with perfume the dancing girls begin their bewitching danceand Edward the VII entersThe rest of the action takes place on earthOn his return from Biarritz the King has fallen illEngland is steeped in

of King StreetStJames sAt his club he sits for half an hour in a deep arm chair reposing both his soul and his bodyThis is for the good of his digestion for he knows that it is unhealthy to eat

my friend once uttered these wordsHe said My dear chapHow could you pass your day betterTell me howI once read a hymn and it struck me so much that I copied it out And MrT produced a little note book from which amazingly he read out the words Sweet day so coolso calmso bright The bridal of the earth and skyThe dews shall weep thy fall to night For thouwith all they sweetsmust die That MrT said exactly reminds me of my daysOf course I shall die one day land if it isn t wrong to say so I hope to go to Heaven for I have never done any harm in my lifeI behave always I hope like an English gentleman and I look carefully after my health which is cherishing the image of Himself that God has given me MrT was speaking in a tone of the deepest SeriousnessAnd indeed he really had cherished in himself the image of his MakerHis gentle walkshis sobriety in both eating and drinkinghis careful avoidance of all disturbing emotionshis daily health exerciseshis naps and his Turkish baths all these things rdally had made him a perfect man of forty one in the very pink of healthThe flesh of his cheeks was vivid and firmhis eyes were clear and bluehis hair crispblond and in excellent conditionHis walk was springyhis back erect and he was beautifully and unobtrusively dressedSo perhaps this is the average man Let us now turn to the averiage womanAbout fifteen years ago I wanted some mushroom catsupIt was in a scatteredlittle populated village of the South of EnglandThe village stood on what had formerly been common landrunning all down the side of a range of hillsBut this common had been long since squatted onso that it was a maze of little hawthorn hedges 52 The Little Review surrounding little closesEach close had a few old apple or cherry treesa patch of potato grounda cabbage patcha few rows of scarlet runnersa few plants of monthly rosesa few plants of marjoram fennelborage or thymeAnd in each little patch there stood a small dwellingMostly these were the original squattershuts built of mudwhite washed outside and crowned with old thatched roofs on which there grew grasseshouse leeks or even irisesr There were a great many of these little houses beneath the September sunshine and it was all a maze of the small green hedgesI had been up to the shop in search of my catsupbut though they sold everything from boots and straw hats to darning needlesbaconharicot beansoatmeal and British wines they had no catsupI was wandering desultorily homewards among the small hedges down hilllooking at the distant seaseven miles awtay over the marshJust beyond a little hedge 1 saw a woman digging potatoes in the dry hot groundShe looked up as I passed and said HulloMeaster I answered HulloMissus and I was passing on when it occurred to me to ask her whether she knew anyone Who sold catsupShe answered NawAw doan t knaw no one I walked on a little farther and then sat down on a stile for half an hour or soenjoying the pleasant weather and taking a read in the country paper which I had bought in the shopThen I saw the largestalwart old woman coming along the stony path carrying two great trugs of the potatoes that she had dug upT I had to get down from the stile to let her passAnd then seeing that she was going my waythat she was evidently oldish and was probably tiredI took the potato trugs from her and carried themShe strode along in front of me between the hedgesShe wore an immense pair of men s hob nailed boots that dragged along the stones of the causeway with metallic soundsShe wore an immense shawl of wool that had been beaten by the weather until it was of a dull liver colouran immense skirt that had once been of lilac cotton printbut was now a rusty brownand an immense straw hat that had been given to her by some one as being worn out and that had cost two pence when it was newHer face was as largeas round and as much the same colour as a copper warming panHer The Little Review 53 mouth was immense and quite toothless except for one large fang and as she smiled cheerfully all the timeher great gums were always to be seenHer shoulders were immense and moved with the roll and heave of those of a great bullockThis was the wisest and upon the whole the most estimable human being that I ever knew at all wellHer hands were enormous and stained a deep blackish green over their original copper colour by the hops that it was her profession to tieAs we walked along she told me that she was exactly the same age as our Queen who was then just seventyShe told me also that she wasn t of those parts but was a Paddock Wood woman by birthwhich meant that she came from the true bop countryShe told me also that her husband had died fifteen years before of the sting of a viperthat his poor old leg went all like green jelly up to his thigh before he died and that he had been the best basket maker in all KentShe also told me that We can t all have everything and that the only thing to do is tokeep all on gooing I delivered up her trugs to her at her garden gate and she said to me with a cheerful nod Well I ll do the same for youmatewhen you come to be my age andwith this witticism she shambled over the rough stone of her garden path and into her dark door beneath the low thatchthat was two yards thickHer cottage was more dilapidated than any that I have ever seen in my lifeIt stood in a very long narrow triangle of groundso that the hedge that I walked along must have been at least eighty yards in lengthwhile at its broadest part the potato patch could not have measured twenty spade breadthsBut before I was come to the end of the hedge her voice was calling out after me MeasterDun yo really want ketchup I replied that I really didShe said Old Meary Spratt up by Hungry Hall wheer ye see me dig ginshe makes ketchup I asked her why she had not told me before and she answered Wellye see the Quality do be asking foolish questionsI thought ye didn t really want to know But indeedas I learnt afterwards it wasn t only the dislike of 54 The Little Re view being asked foolish questionsIn Meary Walker s longwise life she had experienced one thing that no man with a collar and a tie is to be trustedShe had had it vaguely in her mind thatwhen I asked the questionI might be some sort of excise officer trying to find out where illicit distilling was carried onShe didn t know that the making of catsup was not illegalShe had heard that many of her poor neighbours had been fined heavily for selling bottles of home made sloe gin or meadShe had refused to answerout of a sense of automatic caution for fear she should get poor old Meary Spratt into troubleBut next morning she turned up at my cottage carrying two bottles of Meary Spratt s catsup in an old basket covered with a clothAnd after thatseeing her rather often at the shop on Saturday nights when aU the world came to buy its Sunday provisions andbecause she came in to heat the bake oven with faggots once a weekand to do the washing in that isolated neighbourhoodamong the deep woods of the WealdI got to know her as well as I ever knew anybodyThis is her biography to be continuedCooperationA Note on the volume

subtletythat I make the limited public an annual present of that sumfor the privilege of giving them what they do not much wantand forlet us sayforcing upon them a certain amount of literatureand a certain amount of enlightened criticismThis donation I have willingly madeand will as willingly repeatbut I can not be expected to keep it up for an indefinite period Et les vers cerchent le repos I have done my French numberI find it necessary to do most of the Henry James number myselfI will willingly do a Remy DeGourmont numberand even a Spanish number if the available material proves worth the troublebut I can not indefinitely do the work that is performed on the Mercure by a whole staff of rubricists A condensation of this sort of hundred eyed labour is no saving of energy for the condenser Creation is a very slow processIt is possibleby doing a certain amount of well paid but unimportant workfor me to buy leisure sufficient for whatever creative processes are possible to meIt is not possible for me to add to that dual existence a third functionLeaving polysyllableseither the editing of the foreign section of the Little Review has got to pay my board and rentetc and leave me sufficient leisure for my own compositionsor I have got to spend my half time on something more lucrativeIt is bad economy for me to spend a morning tying up stray copies of the Little Review for

decline to have my fwn worksuch as it issmothered by executive functionsAnd unless said functions can relieve me of the necessity of writing ephemeral stuff for other papers I shall be compelled

publish his workand why do the magazines that publish this transcendent art push as hard asthe vulgar sortfor sales See pages 61 and 64 of your June issue There is an inconsistency here that my mind a fairly elastic one cannot away withPerhaps you will be more successful with it if you will be so good as to attack itOf course there is the explanation of the overflowing of the desert but I leave it to you Sometimes I grow a bit weary of these kindergarten questions by people who have failed to read before askingMy remarks were about the artist and his creationnot about economicsthe man and his breadAll I can say to people insisting on the great audience idea is to try thisto have great poetswe must have great audiencestest on otheforms of creationphysical creationfor instanceTo have great audiences an art magazine must have a great sales departmentThe Little Review has no sales department yetjh The Little Review Szukalski s Drawings From ChicagoThe June Little Review has just arrivedNever have I seen such drawingsMy heart actually began to beat faster when I saw themFranklythe rest of the magazine should have been blankEverything else in it appears pallid beside those furious sketchesDa Vinci come to life The lines are full of energythey move across the pagethey make channels for themselves on the paperMagnificentWonderfulNever have I seen such drawingsand thenDa Vinci come to life I suppose this has meaningAnother reader writesHere is a new Beardsley Loose thinking and loose comparisons of this kind damn what they intend to praise and show up an ignorance of both sidesA line in drawing is the path of an emotionnot the boundary of an objectIn this sense Szukalski has no lineneither is he concerned with line as designHis drawings are the energetic illustration of ideasnot the expression of emotionst J On the American NumberComment A David DiamondsteinBrooklynNY Dearjh YourAmericannumber is simply superbThe drawings by Szukalski and theMan of Ideasby Sherwood Anderson are excellentAnderson is truly an American writerIt is too bad that you should have wasted valuable space for Kreymborg and all hisburgs also for Amy LowellWhy do you not include Walter Prichard Eaton among your American writersHe is a poet in the best senseWhile there is great promise in some of the younger setnevertheless we must not overestimate some of their mediocre brayingsCommentplusXT After reading the American number one instantly contrasts it with the work of Englishmen in the preceeding issuesAnd what a disparityEndlessness of Hecht s desolate

very nondescriptHighlights mixed with the wierdest sort of rubbishI wonder if you conceived the number because you knew it would be a humorous answer to those who criticise youfor printing too much foreign stuff TSEliot makes a writer like Stevens look like a school girl straining for originalityFrom the Clergy We are always open to communications from the clergyandbesidesthe single epistle often reveals more of moeurs contemporaines than will a voluminous novelThe following is in our forwarded bagCompare it with our last from the vicarage EPPresbyterian ChurchFor practical me to assume the role of critic of the work of TSEliot after reading the hearty endorsementis presumptous indeedBut since you have asked me to report the impression made upon me as I readjust a wordIn reading the review I was impressed with the power of the reviewer rather than of the reviewedThe chair car being filled on my journey homeI was given temporary place in the drawing roomaloneThere I read aloud and thus reading caught the cadence of the verse without the stilted monotony of the more regular verseBut that was manymany times rudely jarred by the language of the commonplace yeseven the crude and the metaphors impossibleI presume the effort is to present the real but there always is to me a realism into which poetry should not enter the poet has always given me the soul of things and used externals but to suggest the finer things which lie withinOf course MrEliot by his abrupt boldness does give a true presentation but I would rather that he who handles prose found that his mission rather than the poet with his sensibilities keyed to the spiritual valuesThis is an age of revoltI know in governmentsocialism and anarchyin artthe cubist in societythe libertine the extreme of the pendulumbut when applied to poetry it seems like the mailedst of kultur rather than the tapering fingers of cultureThe Little Review Who would think that I should thus have attempted an expression of thought which I seem so unable to suggestI know MrsTwill say that one who has not yet traced the first faint glimmerings of the cubist s art cannot comprehend the work that you have presented to mebut when you have read the book which I am returning by mail under separate coverit would be of keen interest to me to know how you are impressed In the third paragraph our friend the clergyman seems to confuse MrEliotsprofession with his ownA creative poet starts several cuts above the preacher jhCommentby one commented uponMax MichelsonChicagoOn the whole I agree with the editor about the June issueWallace Stevensgroup has charmbut is somewhat romanticI mean the charm is due to a romantic sort of exaggerationIt is not unlike the Georgian Anthologythough modernizedOrit is tired Chinese if that has any meaning to youwhich the mood cannot condoneWilliams is a sound satirebut seems to lack firmnessbut this opinion may be due to the irritation on reading your comment on Michelson s workand is perhaps unfairIn Michelson sTramp Womantheghostand even thesoul business are of course played outbut the poem has economyboldness and directness the lines you picked out have most of these two latter qualities Dans l eauwriteen about five years ago under the influence of Gautierperhaps the White Symphony may lack delicacy but has soundnessandplease remember that there are about half a million delicate and intense and super intense poems written every two yearsbut few sound onesAnd these few are the only ones that matter and lastIn your list of American poets you have left out

edit and why hide itThe Layman speaksRex HunterChicagoThe June number of the Little Review seems to me to be the best yetIt makes a wider appealOf course I don t mean that it will reach the multi 62 The Little Review tude no good stuff does that but that it will please people who are tired of the commercialized hoakum in the average magazine and are honestly desirous of getting something betteryet who are dismayed by the printing of almost an entire number in FrenchBen Hecht s study is very rhythmic and delightfully decadentwith a sort of Huysmans quality the same hatred of mediocrityThe story contributed by Sherwood Anderson has the richnesslike the richness of newly turned loamthat is found in all his workStanislaw Szukalski has a vision which reaches into heaven and hell and tells us their secretsLike Beardsleyhis soul wanders darkly in a mysterious rose garden full of monstrous rosesThe impressionistic prose of James Joyce begins to be a bit bewilderingeven to

printand the savor of Wyndham Lewis melts downto the roots of my brainAs I read there is a slight arresting contraction of the nerves under the stomach caused by the fear that They are watching lest I

characteristics ispossible only to so polite a lady as Alice Groff of PhiladelphiaShe seems to look at everything through rose colored spectacleswhether it be the Critic and Guidewhich deserves her encomiumsor whether it be the Little Review whichin my opiniondoes notWhyBecauseto use Margaret Anderson s phraseologyit is full ofrotten stuff sometimes it is so ugly that one can not read it through but must put it away in disgustSince the historic episode of the Empty Pagesthe Little Review is flourishing only decadent blunderings under the magical wand of the grand dervishMrEzra PoundThe fact is tnai most of the writings are lacking aestheticallypoeticallyand philosophicallyFrom the psychological point of viewone sees in the articles the sad picturewhich runs like red thread on white clothof the miserable personalities of their authorsToo much they mention themselvesFor instanceMrEzra Poundwho likes also to show how many languages he knowsspeaks in his poem as followsand said MrPound is shocked at my levity This visiting card is no manifestation of high poetic powerMany times he pictures as facts the aberrations of his fancyas when he rhapsodizes over a nightingaleTo beautify his rhyme he thinks he must mention the sweetest of all songstersBut in so doing he over compliments the little bird when he states When the nightingale to his mate Sings day long and night late If Ezra Pound had ever with his own ears heard a nightingalehe would have to admit that the bird sings to his mate only at night during the short mating periodWhether he mistook an English sparrow for a nightingale I know notthe fact remains that the poet does not know when the nightingale singsTheImaginary Lettersshow too poor imaginationThe author tries to be clever but his attempts are too painfully evidentWhat can the Little Review see to admire in the writer s calling his wifeopenlyan adulteressDoes he think such a remark a joke or does he imagine that he has discovere3 a new word before unknown to manThere is much pseudo brilliantbut really dullmaterialHoweverlet it passif Margaret Anderson is satisfied with things as they are64 The Little ReviewI have heard the most literal mindedundifferentiated men sayI lived a whole life time in those few minutesThe fact remains that the poet does not know when the nightingale sings It is neither necessary nor interesting for a poet to know these factsThe glory of reason is limited by the possibilities of the human mechanismEmotion art emotion creates its own realitiesjhI have not read much in this number Frank StuhlmanVernonNY Dear Editorhow could you Turn the beautiful Little Reviewthat once bid fair to be one of the finest publications in Americainto a thing of freaks and fakesof posturists and squeaking egoists The much bepraised Joyce sUlyssesis punkLewis Imaginary Lettersare punkier and Ezra Pound is punkiestYou may transpose the names and the values will fit just as wellI cannot see that the drivel that passes for conversation in the Joyce atrocity is improved by the omission of quotation marksJoyce s pleasing habit of throwing chunks of filth into the midst of incoherent maunderings is not at all interesting and rather disgustingWhy the Little Review should waste good paper on the Lewis Letters is a mysteryI am sure no one wants to read themNot even the enthusiastic lady from Cassville and the classicOcumseh Literary Circle As for Ezra PoundI never read but one poem of his that was worth while and that isThe Goodly Frere a really fine ballad in middle age spiritNo freak magazine can hold an audience longIt depends upon shock to taste and convention for its successAnd it is always overdoneIt shrieksThe defiance to MrsGrundy soon manifests itself in just coarseness or worseIt wearies the reader in a little while for in spite of its professions there is a note of insincerity in the whole performance that does not make for permanenceIt is not the work of real peopleonly grinning masks and posturing mountebanksWhy don t you fire Ezra PoundJoyce and Co and write in some of yourselfYou did splendid work in the early numbers before the hegira to San Franciscofrom which date decadence commencedI have not read much in the number but it looks somewhat more favorable than the last two or three issuesAmy Lowell is always goodWhat you need is a literary adviserI read with much interest the little notes telling of the personal appearance of the contributors of the Little Review The Little Review 65 Joyce and Ethics Hart CraneClevelandOhioThe Los Angeles critic who commented on Joyce in the last issue was adquateiy answered1 realizebut the temptation to emphasize such illiteracyindiscriminationand poverty still pulls a little too strongly for resistanceI noticed that W lideBaudelaire and Swinburne arestacked upbeside Joyce as rivals indecadenceandintellect I am not yet aware that Swinburne ever possessed much beyond hisart ears although these were long enoughand adequate to all his beautifulthough often meaningless mouthingsHis instability in criticism and every form of literature that did not depend almost exclusively on sound for effectand his irrelevant metaphors are notoriousAnd as to Wildeafter his bundle of paradoxes has been sorted and connedvery little evidence of intellect remains Decadenceis something much talked aboutand sufficiently misconstrued to arouse interest in the works of any foolAny change in formviewpoint or mannerism can be so abused by the offending partySterility is the onlydecadenceI recognizeAn abortion in art takes the same place as it does in societyit deserves no recognition whateverit is simply outsideA piece of work is artor it isn tthere is no neutral judgmentHoweverlet Baudelaire and Joyce stand togetheras much as any such thing in literary comparison will allowThe principal eccentricity evinced by both is a penetration into life common to only the greatestIf people resent a thrust which discovers some of their entrails to themselvsI can see no reason for resorting to indiscriminate comparisonsnaming colours of the rainbowor advertising the fact that they have recently been forced to recognize a few of their personal qualitiesThose who are capable of being only mildlyshockedvery naturally term the cost a pennybut were they capable of paying a few pounds for the same thinkingexperience and realization by and in themselvesthey could reserve their pennies for work minor to Joyce sThe most nauseating complaint against his work is that of immorality and obscenityThe character of Stephen Dedalus is all too good for this worldIt takes a little experience a few reactions on his part to understand itand could this have been accomplished in a detached
