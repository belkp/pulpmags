have written the open letter to President Wilson on behalf of American literature which appeared in the April CenturyWhenever a man of promise and power shows the white feather those who admire him suffer a keenpersonal painAnd yet MrBjorkman is by no means the last man whom I should expect to make a plea for an official recognitionthrough honorsprizesand subsidiesof an American literatureA conventional literary man could have done itbut a great man neverMrBjorkmanafter remarking the President s ability to appreciate the importance of what he purposes to lay before himasks Will this nationas a nationnever do anything for the encouragement or reward of its poets and men of letters He thinks it ought to do something because the soul of a nation is in its literature and becausewe shall never raise our poetry to the level of our other achievements until weas a nationtry to find some method of providing money for the poet s purse and laurels for his brow No specific proposal is made to the PresidentMrBjorkman outlines the general questioninstances EnglandFranceSwedenand Norway as bestowing honors and rewards upon their writersand says that he has learned by bitter experience what it means to strive for sincere artistic expression in a field where brass is commonly valued above gold and should like to see the road made a little less hardand the goal a little more attractivelest too many of those that come after lose their courage and let themselves be tempted by the incessant clangor of metal in the marketplace Wherefore on behalf of men and women who are striving against tremendous odds to give this nation a poetry equaling in worth and glory that of any other nation in the worldhe appeals to the Chief Executive to take the leadA literature worthy of national fostering does not require itWhen President Wilson read MrBjorkman s letter we may assume that he has somehow found time to do so my little wager is that he smiled sadlyand perhaps recalled a sentence that he wrote nearly twenty years agowhen the spirit of youth gave a sort of instinctive inerrancy to his judgmentsIn an essay on An Author s Company he said Literatures are renewedas they are originatedby uncontrived impulses of natureas if the sap moved unbidden in the mindIn the same essay occurs this wide worldly phraseThere is a greater thing than the spirit of the ageand that is the spirit of the agesCopyright 1914by Margaret CAndersonThe Little Review A man capable of the deepwide thought which these excerpts contain is not the man seriously to consider MrBjorkman s appealLiterature is not a response to a monetary or other invitation it is as inevitable as the sunriseand opportunity neither originates nor develops itThe conditions that govern the rise of sap and its transformations into beauty cannot be set up by legislation nor made easier by Nobel prizesAn artist of original powerborn pregnant with a poema pictureor a symphonywill inevitably give it birthHis necessity is not to receive but to giveHe is independent of the caprice of chanceHe has no thought of a chancefor sincere artistic expression He is not interested in the control of circumstancehe is the instrument of something that controls himOpportunity never knocks at his doorhis door cannot be opened from withoutit is pushed open by an indwellingoutgrowing guestThe process is as uncontrived as the unfolding of an acorn into an oakI fear that MrBjorkman s definition of artif he have oneneeds expansionThe so called art which he wishes to have encouraged as something geographically local is an imitation which probably would suffice in a petty world of orthodox socialismwhere writing was a kind of sociological businessSince unmistakable art is bornnot manufactured or inducedit were folly to try to nurture itUnborn art is nurtured by an inner sap it cannot be fed on sedative papIt always has been and always will be born of sufferingin unexpectedunprepared placeslike all its wild and wonderful kinEugenics cannot be applied to its unfathomable heredityThe soul of a nation is not in its literature but in its contemporary lifeLiteratures haven t soulseven ifhaplythey have considerable vitality or permanenceLiteratures are intricate autobiographiesvague symbols of personal feelinglifted by a modicum of consciousness into mystic articulationThe great literatures that are on the way will be more and more psychologicalWhat people call love in the world of realism will play a sublimer part in the world of consciousnessProse and poetry in which our conscious life is more intimately portrayed will challenge and in a million years increase consciousnessso that through emphasis and use this later acquisition of the race will transmute information into perfect organic knowledgeA larger consciousness will break up the chaos of unnumbered antagonisms in human relationshipsThe literature of description and the blind play of instinct has served its purpose and had its dayThe literature of the future must deal with a vaster world than that in which animals prey upon one anotherSuch a literature will not bear the name of a mana statea nationor an ageWe are opposed to the whole idea of nationalismwe even object to worldliness in literaturewe want something still biggera literature with a sense of the planets in itIn this new day it is too late to fuss about nationsgeographical literaturesand racesWe are called toward the universe and mankindIn this land of blended nationalities our hope is to evolve a literature vitalized by the blood of multitudinous races and linked in pedigree with the infinite ages of the pastWalt Whitman s poetry was cosmicthe new poetry will extend to the planetsThe summit of Parnassus now rests in the gloom of the valleyand the poet of the future will look down from the higher eminence to which science has called himMan today soars in flying machines in the old realm of The Little Review his young imaginationPoets must outreach mere scienceWhat little patriots call a nation is a huge dogma that must be overcomeIn poetry there must be an increasingly larger sense of the universe instead of nations as man s habitationNational literatures arc exclusive of and alien to one another they should be interrelated and fundamentally combinableThere can be no local literature if the thought of the world is embodied in itand any other quality of literature must lack integrityWild dreamers insist upon a literature that shall be superior to political boundariesThe idea of nationalism involves the setting up of barriers and the fossilizing of lifeIt is a small idea that belongs to the dark agesIf we are ever to expand in feelingthoughtand achievement we must rise above nations into the starry spacesWe shall at least be citizens of the worldandif citizens of the worldthen truth seekers beyond the reach of land and seaThe little question put to President Wilson by MrBjorkman cannot escape a negative answerunless through petty exclusions and barbaric insularities we continue trying to organizecementand perpetuate a nation that smug dream of our forefathers who reeked with selfishness and reveled in a freedom that at the core was slaveryStatehood must give way to a universal brotherhoodAnd if this were achieved it would still be idle twaddle to talk about providing money for the poet s purse and laurels for his brow for a poet I am not thinking of facile versifierswho are capable of intoxicating emotional persons with philological colors and sensuous music is rewarded not by money but by understandingand he fashions his own laureleven as the sea pink crowns itself with its ample gloryThe kind of poet whose measure is taken by MrBjorkman s pale solicitude is already generously provided for by an unpoetic publicand there awaits his moist brow a laurel of uncriticalnational homageWhitmanchanter of the earth s major noteand Blakeexquisite singer of its subtlest minorsare clearly recognizable mutationsApart from the work of four or five men English verse falls into infinite grades of imitative excellence and mediocrityThe best of it is highly finished manufactured or in part reproduced artobedient to a commercial agein which little men with renowned names gossip about nationsand worship the god of utilityPoetry of the highest quality great enough to burst a language is the outflow of the unconfutable passion of exceedingly rare individualities that can be neither encouraged nor discouraged by any external conditionThey are vagrant leaps of lifewild with the creative power of projecting varietyThey come off the common stock as new forms having many characteristics common to their ancestors but expressing their unlikeness in mental or physiological developmentReal poets are genuine sports or mutations near poets are made by cultivationAs a nation grows old and the impact of its culture upon all classes of people increasesthe greater its production of so called classical artbut this has nothing to do with what I mean by poetryWhat is popularly termed poetry may represent sincere work it may answer to all the technical requirements of versification it may possess a sheen of word musicit may contain deepsubtle thoughtand yetdespite all these customary earmarksit is not real poetryThe Little Review To be surethousands of critics will acclaim it as authenticand lecturers will quote it as beautiful wisdombut it is soon lost to eye and memoryAnd in a large sense this must be true of the greatest poeticOne reason why we haven t more and better contemporary poetry and prose is that we are under the tyranny of so called mastersIt is foolishly assumed that masterpieces are finalities in their fieldsBy talkingwritingand teaching this absurdity we set up popular prejudices against vital work of our own timeso that even literary artistswith an alleged sharp eye for geniuscannot identify an outstanding genius when it appears before themOnly that poetry or prose which is a reminder of or is almost as good as a celebrity s work is accepted as artWe thus evolve forms of appraisal or standards with which we try to hammer rebels and geniuses into lineThe artist whoconfidentfearlessampleand resolutecan go through this acid test without compromisefightingeven dyingfor his visionis the hope of menHe does not ask for anythinghe is a godthe gods merely command not always posthumouslyand all the world is theirsIt is quite possible to encourage the profession of writing verse and prose by making the road easier and the goal more attractive for the weaklings who whine for nationalized almsto enable them to pursue a craft but literature in the big sense is created by all sorts of men and women who cannot withhold itlet the world approvecondemnor ignoreHence literature is incapable of encouragementIn his Gleamswhich are the most intimately personal things that he has publishedMrBjorkman reiterates the conviction that artists ought to have a better chance than they now enjoy to express themselvesFor instancehe says He who is to minister to men s souls should have time and chance to acquire one for himselfAnd this The children will build up the New Kingdom as soon as they are given a chanceThese extracts from his Gleams taken in connection with our concluding quotation from his Century article indicate if they do not prove that MrBjorkman regards artists as meticulous persons who must be coaxedhumoredcoddledand rewarded in order to incite them to creative activityObviously he means craftsmen when he uses the word artistsAn artist is impelled to do his workwhich is his painjoyand passionIf life is made easy for him the chances are that he will lose his independence and powerand descend to a popular successStevenson could not endure prosperity once a manaccustomed to a harduphill road he did lus noblest work then a sentimental public made it so easy for him that he eventually grew fairly Tennysonian in his output of pretty triflesA literature worthy of the name might address itselfin Whitman s wordsto authors who would be themselves in life and artI do not offer the old smooth

hardly settle yourself to satisfactionbefore you are call d by an irresistible call to depart The Little Review 5 The Challenge of Emma Goldman V Margaret CAnderson GOLDMAN has been lecturing in Chicagoand various kinds of people have been going to hear her have heard her twice once before the audience of well dressed women who flock to her drama lectures and don t know quite what to think of herand once at the International Labor Hall before a crowd of anarchists and syndicalists and socialistsmost of whom were collarless but who knew very emphatically what they thought of her and of her ideasI came away with a series of impressionsevery one of which resolved somehow into a single conviction that here was a great womanThe drama audience might have been dollsfor all they appeared to understand what was going onOne of them went up to Miss Goldman afterward and triedalmost petulantlyto explain why she believed in property and wealthShe was utterly seriousNo one could have convinced her that there was any humor in the situation that she might as well try to work up a fervor of war enthusiasm in Carnegie as to expect Emma Goldman to sympathize in the sanctity of propertyThe second audienceafter listening to a talk on anti Christianitygot to its feet and asked intelligent questionsMen with the faces of fanatics and martyrs waved their arms in their excitement pro and con some one tried to prove that Nietzsche had an unscientific mind a suave lawyer stated that Miss Goldman was profoundly intellectualbut that her talk was destructive to which she replied that it would require another lawyer to unravel his inconsistencyand then some one established forcibly that the only real problem in the universe was that of three meals a dayMost people who read and think have become enlightened about anarchismThey know that anarchists are usually timidthoughtfulunviolent people that dynamite is a part of their intellectualnot their physicalequipmentand that the goal for which they are striving namelyindividual human freedom is one for which we might all strive with creditBut for the benefit of those who regard Emma Goldman as a public menaceand for those who simply don t know what to make of her like that fashionable feminine audience it may be interesting to look at her in a new wayTo begin withwhy not take her quite simplyShe s a simple personShe s naturalIn any civilization it requires genius to be really simple and naturalIt s one of the most subtlebafflingand agonizing struggles we go through this trying to attain the quality that ought to be easiest of all attainment because we were given it to start withWhat a commentary on civilization that one can regain his original simplicity only through colossal effortNietzsche calls it the three metamorphoses of the spirit how the spirit becometh a camelthe camel a lionand the lion at last a child And Emma Goldman has struggled through these stagesShe has taken herheavy load bearing spiritinto the wildernesslike the camel become lord of that wildernesscaptured freedom for new creatinglike the lion and then The Little Reviewcreated new valuessaid her Yea to lifelike the childSomehow Zarathustra kept running through my mind as I listened to her that afternoonEmma Goldman preaches and practises the philosophy of freedomshe pushes through the network of a complicated society as if it were a cobweb instead of a steel structureshe brushes the cobwebs from her eyes and hair and calls back to the less daring ones that the air is more pure up there and sunrise sometimes visible Someone has put it this way Repudiating as she does practically every tenet of what the modern state holds goodshe stands for some of the noblest traits in human nature And no one who listens to her thoughtfullywhatever his opinion of her creedwill deny that she has nobilitySuch qualities as courage dauntless to the point of heartbreakas sincerityreverencehigh mindednessself reliancehelpfulnessgenerositystrengtha capacity for love and work and life all these are noble qualitiesand Emma Goldman has them in the nth powerShe has no pale traits like tactgentlenesshumilitymeeknesscompromiseShe has a hardkind heart instead of a softcruel one And she s such a splendid fighterWhat is she fighting forFor the same thingsconcretelythat Nietzsche and Max Stirner fought for abstractlyShe has nothing to say that they have not already saidperhaps but the fact that she says it instead of putting it into booksthat she hurls it from the platform straight into the minds and hearts of the eagerbewilderedor unfriendly people who listen to hergives her personality and her message a unique valueShe says it with the same unflinching violence to an audience of capitalists as to her friends the workers And the substance of her gospel I speak merely from the impressions of those two lectures and the very little reading I ve done of her published work is something of this sort Radical changes in societyreleasement from present injustices and miseriescan come about not through reform but through changenot through a patching up of the old orderbut through a tearing down and a rebuildingThis process involves the repudiation of such spooks as Christianityconventional moralityimmortalityand all other myths that stand as obstacles to progressfreedomhealthtruthand beautyOne thus achieves that position beyond good and evil for which Nietzsche pleadedBut it is more fair to use Miss Goldman s own wordsIn writing of the failure of Christianityfor instanceshe saysI believe that Christianity is most admirably adapted to the training of slavesto the perpetuation of a slave societyin shortto the very conditions confronting us todayIndeednever could society have degenerated to its present appalling stage if not for the assistance of ChristianityNo doubt I will be told thatthough religion is a poison and institutionalized Christianity the greatest enemy of progress and freedomthere is some good in Christianity itselfWhat about the teachings of Christ and early ChristianityI may be askeddo they not stand for the spirit of humanityfor rightand justiceIt is precisely this oft repeated contention that induced me to choose this subjectto enable me to demonstrate that the abuses of Christianitylike the abuses of governmentare conditioned in the thing itselfand are not to be charged to the representatives of the creedChrist and his teachings are the embodiment of inertiaof the denial of lifehence responsible for the things done in their nameI am not interested in the theological ChristBrilliant minds like BauerStraussKenanThomas Paineand others refuted that myth long agoI am even ready to admit that the theological Christ is not half so dangerous as The Little Review The ethical and social ChristIn proportion as science takes the place of blind faiththeology loses its holdBut the ethical and poetical Christ myth has so thoroughly saturated our livesthat even some of the most advanced minds find it difficult to emancipate themselves from its yokeThey have rid themselves of the letterbut have retained the spirityet it is the spirit which is back of all the crimes and horrors committed by orthodox ChristianityThe Fathers of the Church can well afford to preach the gospel of ChristIt contains nothing dangerous to the régime of authority and wealth it stands for self denial and self abnegationfor penance and regretand is absolutely inert in the face of every indignityevery outrage imposed upon mankindMany otherwise earnest haters of slavery and injustice confusein a most distressing mannerthe teachings of Christ with the great struggles for social and economic emancipationThe two are irrevocably and forever opposed to each otherThe one necessitates couragedaringdefianceand strengthThe other preaches the gospel of nonresistanceof slavish acquiescence in the will of othersit is the complete disregard of character and self relianceandthereforedestructive of liberty and well beingThe public career of Christ begins with the edict Repentfor the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand Why repentwhy regretin the face of something that was supposed to bring deliverance Had not the people suffered and endured enough had they not earned their right to deliverance by their sufferingTake the Sermon on the Mountfor instancewhat is it but a eulogy on submission to fateto the inevitability of things Blessed are the poor in spiritHeaven must be an awfully dull place if the poor in spirit live thereHow can anything creativeanything vitalusefuland beautifulcome from the poor in spiritThe idea conveyed in the Sermon on the Mount is the greatest indictment against the teachings of Christbecause it sees in the poverty of mind and body a virtueand because it seeks to maintain this virtue by reward and punishmentEvery intelligent being realizes that our worst curse is the poverty of the spiritthat it is productive of all evil and miseryof all the injustice and crimes in the world Blessed are the meekfor they shall inherit the earth What a preposterous notionWhat incentive to slaveryinactivityand parasitismBesidesit is not true that the meek can inherit anything Blessed are ye when men shall revile you for great is your reward in heaven The reward in heaven is the perpetual baita bait that has caught man in an iron neta strait jacket which does not let him expand or growAll pioneers of truth have beenand still arereviledBut did they ask humanity to pay the priceDid they seek to bribe mankind to accept their ideasRedemption through the Cross is worse than damnationbecause of the terrible burden it imposes upon humanitybecause of the effect it has on the human soulfettering and paralyzing it with the weight of the burden exacted through the death of ChristThe teachings of Christ and of his followers have failed because they lacked the vitality to lift the burdens from the shoulders of the racethey have failed because the very essence of that doctrine is contrary to the spirit of lifeopposed to the manifestation of natureto the strength and beauty of passionAnd so onIn her dissolution of other myths such as that of moralityfor instanceshe has even more direct things to sayI quote from a lecture on Victims of MoralityIt is Morality which condemns woman to the position of a celibatea prostituteor a recklessincessant breeder of childrenFirst as to the celibatethe famished and withered human plantWhen still a youngbeautiful flowershe falls in love with a respectable young manBut Morality decrees that unless he can marry the girlshe must never know the raptures of lovethe ecstasy of passionThe respectable young man is willing to

as the withered old maid is its victimBut the prostitute is victimized by still other forcesforemost among them the Property Moralitywhich compels woman to sell herself as a sex commodity or in the sacred fold of matrimonyThe latter is no doubt safermore respectedmore recognizedbut of the two forms of prostitution the girl of the street is the least hypocriticalthe least debasedsince her trade

with a man who thinks Emma Goldman ought to have been hanged long agoShe s directly or indirectlyresponsiblefor so many crimesDo you know what she s trying to do I asked himShe s trying to break up our government he responded heatedlyHave you ever read any of her ideasNo Have you ever heard her lecture NoI should say not In a playthat line would get a laugh It did in Man and Superman But in life it fares betterIt gets serious considerationit even has a certain prestige as a rather righteous thing to sayAnother man threw himself into the argumentI know very little about Emma Goldman he said but it has always struck me that she s simply trying to inflame people particularly to do things that she d never think of doing herself That charge can be answered best by a study of her lifewhich will show that she has spent her time doing things that almost no one else would dare to doIn his Women as World Builders Floyd Dell said this Emma Goldman has become simply an advocate of freedom of every sortShe does not advocate violence any more than Ralph Waldo Emerson advocated violenceIt The Little Review isin factas an essayist and speaker of the kindif not the qualityof EmersonThoreauand George Francis Trainthat she is to be considered I thinkratherthat she is to be considered fundamentally as something more definite than thatas a practical NietzscheanI am incapable of listeningunarouscdto the person who believes something intenselyand who does intensely what she believesWhat more simple or more difficult Most of us don t know what we believeorif we dowe have the most extraordinary time trying to live itEmma Goldman is so bravely consistent which to many people is a confession of limitationsBut if one is going to criticise her there are more subtle grounds to do it onOne of her frequent assertions is that she has no use for religionThat is like saying that one has no use for poetryreligion isn t merely a matter of Christianity or Catholicism or Buddhism or any other classifiable quantityAlsoif it is true that the person to be distrusted is the one who has found an answer to the riddlethen Emma Goldman is to be discountedHer convictions are presented with a sense of definite finalityBut there s something splendidly uncautioussomething irresistibly stirringabout such an attitudeAnd whatever one believesof one thing I m certainwhoever means to face the world and its problems intelligently must know something about Emma GoldmanWhether her philosophy will change the face of the earth isn t the supreme issueAs the enemy of all smug contentmentof all blind acquiescence in things as they areand as the prophet who dares to preach that our failures are not in wrong applications of values but in the values themselvesEmma Goldman is the most challenging spirit in AmericaNo sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its placeand thistoowill be swept awayObserve always that everything is the result of a

impression of any subject from our own life here are fewand these notit would appeargreatly in vogueWhyEveryone will have his own answerIn replying to the first part of the question why closely considered individual impressions of our life are few I think it should be said that the habit of respect for close attention of any kind is not among the American virtuesThe visitor of our political conventionsthe reader of our literary criticism must have noted a prevailingshufflingand perfunctory mood of casual disregard for the matter in handMany American people are indeed reared to suppose that if they appear to bestow an interested attention on the matter before themsome misunderstanding will ensue as to their 14 The Little Reviewown social importanceNearly everyone must have noted with a sinking of the heart this attitude towards the public among library attendantshotel clerksand plumbersThis abstraction is nothoweverconfined to the pursuers of any occupationbut to some degree affects us allIn the consciousness of our nation there appears to exist a mysterious though deep seated awe for the prestige of the casual and the off handEspecially we think it an unworthiness in an author that he shouldas the phrase istake himself seriously We consider the attitude we have described as characterizing library attendants and hotel clerks as the only correct one for writers the attitude of a person doing something as it were unconsciouslya matter he pooh poohs and scarcely cares to expend his energy and time upon in the grand course of his personal existenceYou may hear plenty of American authors talk ofnot taking themselves seriously whoif they spoke with accuracyshould say that they regarded themselves as too important and precious to exhaust themselves by doing their work with conscienceThis dull self importance insidiously saps in our country the respect for thoroughness and application characteristic of Germany insidiously blunts in American penetrative powers the English faculty of beingkeenon a subjectrecently presented to us with such grace in the young hero s eager pursuits in Compton Mackenzie s Sinister Streetand disparages lightly but often completely the growth of the fresh and varied spirit of production described in the passage of de Maupassant to which MrGalsworthy refersThis passage expresses the clear fire of attention our American habits lackwith a sympathy it is a pleasure to quote here in its entiretyDe Maupassant says in the preface of Pierre et JeanFor seven years I wrote versesI wrote storiesI wrote novelsI even wrote a detestable playOf these nothing survivesThe masterFlaubertread them alland on the following Sunday at luncheon he would give me his criticismand inculcate little by little two or three principles that sum up his long and patient lesson I f one has any originalitythe first thing requisite is to bring it outif one has nonethe first thing to be done is to acquire it Talent is long patienceEverything which one desires to express must be considered with sufficient attention and during a sufficiently long time to discover in it some aspect which no one has yet seen or describedIn everything there is still some spot unexploredbecause we are accustomed to look at things only with the recollection of what others before us have thought of the subject we are contemplatingThe smallest object contains something unknownLet us find itIn order to describe a fire that flames and a tree on the plainwe must keep looking at that flame and that tree until to our eyes they no longer resemble any other treeor any other fireThis is the way to become originalHaving besides laid down this truth that there are not in the whole world two grains of sandtwo speckstwo handsor two noses alikeFlaubert compelled me to describe in a few phrases a being or an object in such a manner as to clearly particularize itand distinguish it from all the other beings or all the other objects of the same raceor the same species When you pass he would saya grocer seated at his shop doora janitor smoking his pipea stand of hackney coachesshow me that grocer and that janitortheir attitudetheir whole physical appearanceincluding also by a skilful description their whole moral nature so that I cannot confound them with any other grocer or any other janitormake me seein one wordthat a certain cab horse does not resemble the fifty others that follow or precede itOne underlying reason why American writers so seldom pursue such studies and methods as these is the prevailing disesteem for clearly focussed attention we The Little Review 15have describedAnother reason is that the American writer of fiction who loves the pursuit of precise expression will indubitably have to face a number of difficulties which may perhaps not be readily apparent to the writers of other countriesNaturally enoughin his more newly settledor rather his settlingnationmade up of many nationalitiesthe American writer who desires to particularizea subject from his country s contemporary historyandto distinguish this from all the other beings and all the other objects of the same race will have many more heretofore unexpressed conditions and basic circumstances to evoke in his reader s mind than the German or French or English writer must summonFor instancethe young French writer of de Maupassant s narrative who was to call up out of the deep of European life the individuality of one single French grocerwould himself have and would address an audience who had whether for better or worseto my way of thinkingas it chancesfor worse a fairly fixed social conception of the class of this retail merchantThe American writer who knows very well that General Grant once kept an unsuccessful shoe storeand that some of the most distinguished paintings the country possesses have been selected by the admirably educated taste and knowledge of one or two public spirited retail dry goods merchants and who also has seen gaunt and poverty stricken Russian store keepers standing among stalls of rotten strawberries in Jefferson Street marketin Chicago that writer will neither speak from nor address this definite social conception according to mere character of occupation which I have indicated as a part of the French author s means of exactitude in expressionNothing in our own random civilizationas it seems to meis quite so fixed as that French grocer seated in his doorwaythat de Maupassant and Flaubert mention with such charmNothing here is so neat as thatTo convey social truththe American writer interested in giving his own impression of a grocer in Americawhether rich or poor or moderately prosperingwill have to individualize him and all his surrounding condition moreand to classify him and all his surrounding condition lessthan de Maupassant doesto convey the social truth his own inimitable sketches impartAgainours is a very changing populationIts movement of life through one of our cities is attended with various and choppy and many toned sounds communicating a varied rhythm of its ownT o return to our figure of the retail tradesman if this tradesman be in Chicagofor instancehe may neither be expressed clearly by typical classificationsnor shown without a genuine error in historical perspective against a static street background and trade lifeThis background must have change and motionunless the writer is to copy into his own picture some foreign author s rendition of a totally different place and state of human existenceThe tune of the story s texttooshould repeat for the reader s inward ear the special experience of truth the author has perceivedthe special ragged sound and rhythm of the motion of life he has heard telling the tale of that special placeMay one add what is only too obviousand said because I think it may serve to explain in some degree why individual impressions of American life are not greatly encouraged in this countryIt will be quite plain that such a limpidclear spacedreverent style and stilled 16 The Little Reviewbackground as speaks in one of MrGalsworthy s stories the tragedy of a London shoe maker s commercial ruinwould be false to all these valuesIt will be quite plain that such a brightharddefinite manner as that which states with perfection the life of the circles of the petty government official and his wife in The Necklace would be powerless to convey some of the elements we have selected as characterizing the American subject we have tried to suggestBut many American reviewers and professional readers and publisherswho suppose themselves to be devoted torealismand to writing ofradicaltendencybelieve not at all that the realistic writer should adopt de Maupassant s method and incarnate for us his own American vision of the life he sees herebut simply that he should imitate the manner of de MaupassantMany such American reviewers and professional readers and publishers believe not at all that the radical writer should find and represent for us some unseen branching root of certain American social phenomena which he himself has detectedbut simply that he should copy some excellent drawing of English roots by MrGalsworthyor of Russian roots by GorkyThe craze for imitation in American writing is almost unbelievably pervasiveThe author herewho is devoted to the attempt to speak his own truth and the more devoted he is the more reverentlyI believewill he regard all other authorstruth as theirs and derived exactly from their own point of view will find opposed to him not only the great body of conventional romanticists and conservatives who will think he ought to stereotype andconventionalize his work into a poordulled contemporary imitation of the delightful narratives of Sir Walter ScottHe will also find opposed to him the great body of conventional realists and radicals who will think he ought to stereotype and conventionalize his work into a poorblurred imitation of the keen narratives of MrHGWellsSometimes these counsellorsnot content with commending a copied mannerseriously urge one might think at the risk of advising plagiarism that the American author simply transplant the social ideas of some admirable foreign artist to one of our own local scenesThusa year or two agoin one of our critical journalsI saw the writer of a novel about Indiana state politicians severely blamed for not making the same observations on the subject that MrWells had made about English national parliamentary life in The New MachiavelliNot long since another American reviewer ofradicaltendency harshly censured the author of a novel about American under graduate life in a New York collegebecause the daughter of the college president uttered views of sex and marriage unlike those expressed in Ann VeronicaThis sort of criticism equally unflattering and obtuseit appears to mein its perception of the special characterizations of MrWells s thoughtful pagesand in its counsel to the artist depicting an alien topic to insert extraneous and unrelated views in his landscape proceeds from a certain strange and ridiculous conception of truth peculiar to many persons engaged in the great fields of our literary criticism and of our publishing and political activitiesThis is a conception of truth not at all as something capable of irradiating any scene on the globelike light but as some very definite and limited forcedriving a band wagonPeople who The Little Review 17possess this conception of truth seem to argue very reasonably that if MrWells is in itso to speakwith truthand is saying the thing to say about sex or about the liberal partythen the intelligent author anywhere who desires to bein it with truth will surely get into this band wagon of MrWells s and stand on the very planks he has placed in the platform of its particular wagon bedIt is an ironicalif tragiccomment on the intelligence of American reading that the driver I have chanced to see most frequently urged for authors here should be MrHGWellswho has done probably more than any other living writer of English to encourage varied specialistic and non partisan expressionWe have said that to tell his own truth the American writer will have to sit longer before his subject and will have more to do to express itthan if he chose it from a country of more ancient practices in artand of longer ancestral sojournsWe have said that he will be urged not to tell his own truth considerably more than an English or German or French writer would beThese authors are at least not advised to imitate American expressionand they live in countries where the habit of copying the work of other artists is much less widely regarded as an evidence of sophistication than it is hereThe American writer must also face a marked historical peculiarity of our national lettersThe publishing centres of England and of Germany and of France are in the midst of these nationsOutside the daily pressthe greater part of the publishing business of our own country is in New York situated in the northeast cornernearly a continent away from many of our national interests and from many millions of our populationBy an odd coincidenceoutside the daily pressthe field of our national letters in magazine and book publication seems to be occupied not at all with individual impressions of truth from over the whole countrybut with what may be called the New York truthThe young American author in the Klondike or in San Francisco who desires to sit long before his subject and to reveal its hitherto unrecorded aspect must do so with the clear knowledge that the field of publication for him in the East is already filled by our old friend the New York Klondikescarcely changed by the disappearance of one dog or sweater from the early days of the gold discoveries and that no earthquake has shaken the New York San FranciscoOf course we knowbecause she almost annually reassures the country on these pointsthat New York instantly welcomes all original and fresh writing arising from the remotest borders of the nation and that in all these matters she is not and never possibly could be dullYet one can understand how the Klondike authorinterestedas MrGalsworthy advisesin seeing an object in the way that he alone can see it and with the part of him which makes him This man and not That might feel a trifle dashed by New York s way of showing her love of originality in spending nearly all the money and energy her publishers and reviewers have in advertising and in praising authors as the sixteenth Kipling of the Klondike or the thirtieth OHenryof CaliforniaThis is apt to be bewilderingtoofor the readers of MrKipling and 0Henrywho have enjoyed in the tales of each of these men the truth told with the part of him which makes him This man and not 18 The Little ReviewThat It is possible to understandtoohow the young author in San Francisco may feel that since New York s consciousness of his city has remained virtually untouched for eight years by the greatest cataclysm of nature on our continentperhaps she overrates the extreme swiftness and sensitiveness of her reaction to novel impression from withoutand might conceivably not hear a story of heretofore unexpressed aspects of San Francisco told by the truthful voice of one young writerThese are some of my own guesses as to why individual impressions of our national life are few and why they are not greatly in vogue in AmericaWhether they be poor or good guesses they represent one Middle Western reader s observation of some of the actual difficulties that will have to be faced in America by the writer who by temperament desires to follow that golden and beautiful way of Flaubert swhich MrGalsworthy has mentionedThis writer will doubtless get from these difficulties far more fun than he ever could have had without themThey are suggested here in the pages of TH E LITTLE REVIEWnot at all with the idea of discouraging a single traveler from setting out on that splendid roadbut rather as a step towards the beginning of that true and long comradeship with effort that is worth befriending which

ourselves I think that HGWellsmore than any other literary manhas lived in consonance with the law of change An expanding knowledge precludes constancyAll John Prices are obscurantistsConvictions and blind faith based upon glorified ignorance have for thousands of years encystedcrampedand twisted personal lifebut somehow it has burst through the fetters and arrayed itself for successive strugglesAnalyzing what we see and knowand confessing what we think we feelwe have the ancient riddle before usWe applaud a play like Changebut seek security and stability in every relationshipEventually every man must feel what Rousseau wrote Everything in this world is a tangled yarnwe taste nothing in its puritywe do not remain two moments in the same stateOur affectionsas well as bodiesare in perpetual flux Maybe Sam Thatcher was wisebut if we knew that our life were cyclic the joy of it to us would ceaseThe wiser man does not know so much as Sam professedbut his endless endeavor is to try to know moreThe law of changewhich he sees enforced everywhereincreases his insatiabilityIt is ultimate questions to which Change gives riseand to such questions there are no satisfactory answersThe social value of the play lies in the graphic clearness with which it illustrates the slow but epochal shifts that are always under way in thinking individualsfamiliesand nationsThere is no Rock of Ages in the land of courageous knowledgeNothing endures but mutabilityThe purpose of a play like Change is to open the inner mind to this glorious truthso that with a fortitude born of understanding we may accept misfortunecalamityand death as the effects of unalterable lawand not as donated penalties or inscrutable accidentsPoisepowerand personality are the fruits

weak Live notLittle Review Correspondence The Vision of Wells like to setMMsmind at rest about HGWellsbut I can t quite understand what her objection to him really isShe seems to be in what the charming little old Victorian lady would have called a state of mind Something about Wells annoys hershe hasn t thought it out clearlybut she raps Wells wherever she can get at himas a sort of personal revenge for her discomfortSupposefor the sake of argumentthat the passage she quotes from the hero really represents Wells s feeling about the relations between the sexesHe believes that under existing conditions there is always danger of love between men and women unless the man has one sole woman intimateand lets a superficial friendship toward all other women veil impassable abysses of separation MM wisely admits the truth of that in factit s the most obvious of truismsThen the hero or Wells goes on to say that thisto himis an intolerable state of affairsFor thisMM calls himwicked and MrMM accuses him of not being busy enoughand of not working for a livingI wonder if MM stopped to think exactly why the hero considers this an intolerable state of affairsThe statement means nothing more than that the man would like to have intimate friendships with more than one womanHe doesn t say he wants to love more than one womanWellit is easily conceivable that a man of active mind and companionability would like to have some degree of intimacy with various womenThere doesn t seem to be anything wicked about thatand it s possible that he should feel so even if he was working for a living If we confine ourselves to one intimacywe re likely to lose the full relish of it before many yearsThe thought of that is certainly intolerableA man who is close to a good many people is usually better fitted to appreciate his best friendA woman novelist who has a conspicuously successful marriage put it well the other dayIf you go into a room where there is a bunch of violets she said yo u are charmed by the odorIf you stay in the room all the timeyou forget about the odor or it bores youBut if you are continually going out and coming in againit greets you every timeand you learn to appreciate its subtleties Perhaps MM thinks that reason is begging the questionWelltake the other sideAny human being who is expanding has an insatiable desire for new experiencenew knowledgeThat is the healthiest instinct in mankindSuch a person would naturally fret at the inability to be intimate with a new acquaintance who interests himThat feeling would not be wickedit would be rightby any sane standardForgive the blatant obviousness of all thisBut I m bent on carrying through the discussion to the endGrantedthenthat our hero s feeling is not intrinsically wicked what thenHe faces a dilemmaEither he must run the risk of a new love affairor and thisI thinkescaped MM present condiThe Little Review 29tions must be changedIf he has a new love affairhe is at the least violating the Victorian lady s conventional moralitywhich says that every man must love not more than one woman as long as that woman livesWe come then to an extremely vital problemOn the one handis conventional morality desirableOn the othercan present conditions be so changed as to eliminate the danger The solution of that problem is of great importance to anyone interested in human beingsIf it can t be solvedit means that the man or woman must quench a right and healthy instinct along whichever line he or she choosesAnd that s a bit of pessimism which a warm hearted man like HGWells doesn t want to accept without further investigationThat s the reason he wrote The Passionate FriendsHe is engaged in the noble endeavor to do something at least toward freeing the great spirit of mankind from the network in which it is enmeshedThe history of that struggle is the history of human progressPerhaps it isn t necessary further to defend MrWells for the sort of novels he writesBut I d like to offer an illustration of the difference between Wells and the old fashioned novelistThe old writer started with the conviction that certain laws and fundamental conditions were forever fixedand must limit the destinies of his charactersHe then works out his little story according to rulesand gets his effect by arousing in us pity for the misfortuneshatred for the sinsand joy for the virtuous triumphs of his peopleThe tendency of the whole was to show us once more what the eternal verities were and the result was highly moral Every character was an object lessonWellson the other handis not a preacherbut a scientistHe starts with the conviction thatthrough lack of impartial investigationwe don t really know what the eternal verities areor what power can be derived from themHis attitude is as far from the old writersas is MmeCurie s from the alchemists He attempts to free his mind from every prejudiceThen he begins his experimentputs lus characters in their retort undercontrolled conditions and watches what happensWhat his characters do corresponds to fact as well as his trained mind can make itThe result may be negative or positivebut at least it is trueandlike all truthit is really valuableMM prejudges the case when she talks about denialand building up characterand loyaltyand unselfishnessThese things may demand her conclusionand again they may notAt best they are means to an endShe may be rightBut Wells is going ahead to find outHe isn t arguing for anythingWe may be denying something we ought to have we may be building the wrong kind of characterwe may be loyal to a false principle we may be unselfish with evil resultBut if we cease to becloud the issueand watch carefully the experiment of MrWells and his followerswe shall know more about it than we doAndfor a general toning of her mindI should like to askMM to read The Death of Eveby William Vaughn Moodyto pay particular attention to the majestic song of Eve in the gardenand after she has felt the tremendous impulse of that lineWhoso denyeth aughtlet him depart from here to turn back to her words about denialand see whether she still thinks denial is always synonymous with strengthGEORGE SOULELittle Review Another View ofThe Dark Floweris with no desire to be carping that I offer this criticism of The Dark Flowerfor Itooam a devoted disciple who hangs on the master s lips but being a skeptical modern woman withalI am not abjectPerhaps we should be satisfied with what Galsworthy has given us this searching vision into the soul of a rarely sensitive manThe writing of it what we term styleis beyond doubt Galsworthy s most distinguished performancefar more poetical than any of his verseIts material is invaluable for its sheer honesty as well as its sheer beautyIts reality and intimacy are grippingly poignantAnd yet how account for the pain of futility which sweeps over you as you close the bookdrowning for the time the ecstasy of high joy in all its beautyIt is as if the heavy aroma of autumn s decay had invaded a garden in early springYesthere is something essentially futile about The Dark FlowerIt lies so hidden in the warp and woof of the whole fabric that the casual reader passes it over unseenI can best explain by referring to the novel itselfEach of the three episodes deals with Mark Lennan s passion for a woman in his youth for an older womanin his maturity for a woman his own agein his approaching autumn for a young girlAnd in all three passion the great primal force is made an illicit emotionIn the first two episodes the women are married in the lastLennan isIt is scarcely by chance that Lennan s loves were unlawful on the contrarya symbolic significance seems to be intendedthat passion is naturalfreecoming and going by tides unbound by man s will or lawBut if that was Galsworthy s aimhe has run an unnecessary stretch beyond his goalBy his over emphasispassion becomes purposefully illicitvoluntarily seeking out the forbidden object and the secret passageAnd instead of being the priceless inheritance from a free Godpassion becomes an ailment laid upon us by some designing fateAnd now glance at the dénouement of each episodeIn the first it is the woman who closes the little drama Mark merely watches her goIn the second the woman s husband kills herand Mark is left dazedIn the last his wife steps in and turns the current of eventsAlways an extraneous force makes the decision for himHe is never permitted to grapple with the situation createdGalsworthy forever extricates himNot once is his passion allowed to run its courseEach experience is abortiveIf I had been Mark Lennan I should have been tempted to curse the meddling fate that insisted upon rescuing me just before I jumpedNoa woman would not have had her perfect moment with Mark Lennanbut only the promise of itMark is a futile personhis love life a procession of futile experiencesBut in spite of its futility it is an exquisite record

Foster s paper entitled The Prophet of a New Culture in the March issue induced me to give that notable article a third readingMHPsays there s too much enthusiasm to be borne out by what he actually says and then asks the authorWon t you forget a little of this sound and fury and tell us as simply as you can just what it is that you want us to do This obviously tired and disturbed critic continuesI have a feeling that pure enthusiasmwasting itself in little geysersis intrinsically ridiculousEnthusiasm should grow trees and put magic in violetsand that can t be done with undue quicknessor in any but the most simple wayNobody cares about the sap except for what it does This irrelevant criticism is an intellectually lazy protest of a sensuousself styled healthy person blundering through an interpretative analysis of hardserious thoughtexpecting to find a program or a plancut and driedready for the seekers of a new cultureDrFoster properly avoided making any definite proposals based upon his study of NietzscheWith a contagious enthusiasm he wrote his own response to Nietzsche s attitude toward the universeTo condemn his animation is barbaric stupidityHe probably was not conscious when he wrote the paper that anybody wanted him to outline in desiccated phrases a scheme to crystallize the Nietzschean philosophy into personal or social actionHe was fired by his subjectand his function I do not say his purpose was to spread the flameThe depths of feeling must be reached before action can be more than an abortion of the mindDrFoster s seriousalmost sadenthusiasmmakes the spirit of Nietzsche arouse feelingandfeeling underlies every organic social actionIt is not what he actually says but what Nietzsche says to him that explains and justifies DrFoster s enthusiasmAn incoherent generalization like pure enthusiasm wasting itself in little geysers is intrinsically ridiculous is a part of the typical literary method of veneering ignorance or prejudicesFor a critic who asks what is it that you want us to do which is the desperate voice of an imitationistand then talks glibly of pure enthusiasm which is gaseous rhetoricI have neither respect nor compassionWhat is pure enthusiasm MHPs objection tosound and fury which he associates withpolitical speeches fo r a major prophet clearly is attributable to a temperamental inability to understand Nietzsche or emotionally to respond to his dynamic appeal to intelligenceA healthy critic was there ever oneis a mythor a morbidly self conscious person whose striving after healthy attitudes is an infallible sign of disease at the topSuch a person is pathologically interestingbut in the realm of philosophical criticism he is incompetentI should expect him to demand that enthusiasm should grow trees and put magic in violets which is a ridiculous horticultureTo limit enthusiasm to so definite a purpose as this is to affect a poetic attitude whose labored simplicity has

Future This sentence from the article bears interestingly upon MHPs allegation of undue quickness in what the author expects from the adoption of the Nietzschean view of lifeAs for nobody caring about the sapI should say that if he have an enthusiasm for growing trees and putting magic in violets he willperforcehave that care for the sap which conditions the strength of the tree and the magic of

her prejudices and her pride and has awarded to a foreigner and that foreigner an American the most coveted prize in the whole realm of paintingShe has given to Lawton Parker of Chicago the first medal at the Old SalonHitherto it has been an unwritten law that the first medal was not to go out of FranceThe most ambitious American studentdreaming in his little atelier high up among the pigeonsover fifty centimesworth of roast rabbit from the rôtisserie and a glass of vin ordinairenever has dared even to dream of a first medalA second has been the height of his wildest hopesTen times

CameronAston Knightthe son of Ridgeway Knightand Richard EMiller are among the others so honoredGari Melchers and Frederick MacMonnies have had a third medalNow Lawton Parker has carried off the firstEven for a Frenchman this is an extraordinary honorIt is kept for paintings of most unusual meritand often no work of the many thousands submitted is considered worthy of the honorAt least four Salons have passed without the award being made at allThe painting with which MrParker has enchanted Paris is called Paresseor IndolenceIt is a picture of a nude model resting on a couchShe lies perfectly relaxedher body twisted a little and one arm raised behind her headThe delicate flesh tones are outlined against pale draperiesmauvegrayand light yellowThe whole composition is in a very high keythe red hair of the girl being the strongest note in the pictureBut it is the lighting which seems most strongly to have impressed the French criticsMore than forty reviews in Europe have contained favorable accounts of this paintingand they have been unanimous in their praise of the effects of lightingIndeedthey have almost exhausted the vocabulary in their efforts to describe itIt is the light of a gray day filtered through a Venetian blindand the picture s most puissant charm lies in the way MrParker has caught the delicate and subtle values of this lightingDelicatenebulouspalesiftedintimatetenderharmonious these are some of the adjectives used by the French reviewers to describe itAll this ishoweverbuilt on a foundation of solid knowledgeMrParker is an excellent draughtsman and understands thoroughly the possibilities and limitations of his mediumHe has long34 The Little Reviewbeen known among the artists in the Quarter as the most scientific of them allThe chemical composition of the colorstheir action and interactionand the result of time on their brilliancy these MrParker has studied minutelyIt is a subject with which the old masters were thoroughly familiarbut which painters of to day too often neglectSanity is one of the chief characteristics of MrParker s workThis is a day of extravaganceof cutting loose from all ties that bind us to the pastIn Paris the academies are virtually emptied of studentsthat the young men may search for individuality in their own little ateliersThe Cubists and the Futurists are the flowering of the tree of experimentation that has thrust its roots even into the most academic ofsanctuariesMany a promising young man has lost his head entirelyBut Lawton Parker has succeeded in keeping hisHe has gone forward with his daybut not blindlyHe has carefully tested each step as he came to itand has stopped short where sanity stoppedThe old virtues of draughtsmanshipcompositionand color he has keptBut he has added thereto the modern discoveries in the treatment of lightHe and his colleaguesthe little group of painters called the Giverny schoolare already known as LuministsFrederick CFriesekeRichard EMillerand Karl Anderson belong to this groupDuring the summer months they paint at the beautiful little village of GivernyThey experiment with light in all its possible manifestationsFrieseke and Parker have an open air studio togethera water garden traversed by a little brookHere on warm days they paint beautiful opalescent nudes in the sunlightamong the shimmering greens of the leaves or beside the luminous water surfacesAll who have followed the exhibitions in France or even in America during the last few years are familiar with this nymph pasture as it has been wittily calledIt was here that the prize picture was painted but not on warmsunny daysA year ago it rained all summerand in desperation MrParker resorted to an indoor canvasexecuted in the house adjoiningIt was painted with extreme careOne comparatively unimportant part of the canvasa bit of wall spacehe painted over twelve or fifteen times to get just the precise shade he wantedThis painting is now on exhibition in this countryLawton Parker s canvases in his Giverny style are interesting technicallyOn a foundation of very careful drawing they are handled with great freedom of executionThe brush work is loose and vigorousthe paint being laid on thicklyespecially in the backgroundThe flesh is painted more closelyalways with great subtlety in the valuesA nude body in the shade flecked with spots of brilliant sunlight is a favorite and very difficult subjectin which this subtlety is well shownThe color is excellentat timesas in the prize picturevery delicate and carefully harmonizedat times dealing successfully with great splashes of autumn leaves or the vivid green of spring foliageThe composition is pleasingMrParker is not by any means limited to this styleIndeedit is in another and quite different character that he is best known in this countryAs a portrait painter his work has for a number of years been gaining steadily in popularityMany prominent people have sat for himincluding President Harry Pratt JudsonJudge Peter SGrosscupMartin RyersonMrsLeonard Woodand MrsNWHarrisThe Little Review This portrait style of MrParker s is very different from his Giverny styleHe developed it much earlier in his careerbut still uses it on occasionThe difference is one of psychological viewpoint rather than of technicA portraithe feelsshould be a livable presentation of the subjectIt is not a picture to be looked at casually and passed bybut a work to be lived with intimately for long spaces of timeThe exceptions areof coursethose portraits of well known men and women which are to hang in public placesGenerally speakinghe paints his portraits in color schemes that will wear wellin a rather low keywith neutral backgroundsThese likenesses are soliddignifiedand simpleTo catch the individuality of the sitter is of more importance to him than to paint a striking canvasThat his portraits are successful technically is proved by the fact that he has taken a number of prizes with themboth here and abroadLawton Parker was born at FairfieldMichiganin 1868but spent his early youth in KearneyNebraskaWhen he took up seriously the study of painting he moved to Chicagowhich hassince remained his pied à terre in this countryHe studied and taught at the Art Institute thereLater he went to New Yorkwherein 1897he took theParis Prizefounded by John Armstrong Chaloner a five yearsscholarship abroadIn Paris he studied under GeromeWhistlerand Jean Paul LaurensIn 1899 he took thePrix d atelier at the Beaux ArtsIn 1900 he received honorable mention at the Old Salon with a nude in 1902 a third medalon a portraitFour years ago he missed by three votes a second medalwhich was fortunate for himsince the first cannot be awarded a painter who has received a secondHe has also received medals from the Chicago Society of Artiststhe StLouis Expositionand the International Exhibition in Munich in 1905All lovers of art in this countryas well as the painters themselvesshould thank MrParker for having opened the way in Paris for so unprecedented an honorIt is rhythm that makes musicthat makes poetrythat makes pictureswhat we are all after is rhythmand the whole of the young man s life is going to a tune as he walks hometo the same tune as the stars are going over his headAll things are singing together George Moore in Memoirs of My Dead SelfThe Little Review New York Letter GEORGE SOULE PAVLOW A and her Russian dancers have just finished their tour here in a high tide of enthusiasmand financial successwhich is worth mentioning because it means other tours next yearThere is a whisper that we shall see a ballet still more important which hasn t hitherto been coaxed west of London and ParisOnly a little of the new art form now being developed by FokineDiaghilevBakstRimski Korsakoffand the rest of the great Russian romanticists of the stagehas come to usBut the important fact is that Americaas always behind Europe in seeing new ideas that are not mechanicalis at last waking up to the dance as an art on equal terms with the greatestIt is curiousbut not comfortingto know that in this case the original inspiration came from IllinoisM y authority is Troy Kinneywho iswithout questionour best informed critic of dancing outside of the performers and choregraphers themselvesMrKinney tells me that after Isadora Duncan failed to arouse much interest in America she went to Europeleaving a trail of heated discussion thereWhen she reached StPetersburg the head of the imperial academyFokinesaw the vision of a renaissance of the dance from its classic sterilityHe gathered about him the group of dancers whose names are now known around the worldand persuaded them to desert the imperial academywhich clungto the formalism of the old French and Italian balletArtists and musicians were attracted to the movementThis proceeding was quite as daring as it would have been for the superintendent of the United States Naval Academy to desert with part of his faculty and the best of the middiesBut Diaghilev espoused their cause and persuaded the government not to punish thembut to let them work out their ideas and then make themselves useful politically by showing western Europe that Russia was not as barbarous as was generally supposedThey are now fully recognized in StPetersburg and Fokine is again head of the academyOn the basis of the old formal steps and positions Fokine built a freer structure of movement whose chief aim is not virtuosity or pure beauty of linebut expressionIn this new style more modern music was not only possiblebut necessaryMeanwhilesetting and costume of the most imaginative type often futuristic had to be developedThey all set to work with an ardor possible only to tradition breakers and are producing an art which is likely to achieve the supreme place first dreamed of by the inventors of modern operaHere is another keenly interesting relation brought to light by MrKinneyEverybody knowsof coursethat opera was begun during the Renaissance as an attempt to revive the Greek dramaIt now appears that in our present Renaissance the revived ballet is probably much nearer the highest form of Greek drama than opera or anything else ever has beenThe early drama of Athensaccording to MmeNelidoff of Moscowconsisted largely of pantomimedanceand chorusWords were introduced for the literal mindedAs the size of theatres increasedthe actors came to use The Little Review megaphonesto conceal which the mask was inventedThe masks were made larger and heavier to add to the heightWith this handicap to dancingthe actor had to depend more on his voice and statureand the elaborate dialoguecombined with the high heels of the cothurnusgave dancing its final blowThis kind of dramasays MmeNelidoffappealed largely to the less imaginative and uncultivatedon account of their desire to know in detail what was going onThe other kindhowevercontinued being developed for smaller audiencesand retained its purer beauty of form in spacesoundand thoughtWe have little record of it outside of sculpture simply because there were few wordsand a chorégraphie vocabulary had not been inventedWe have almost no record of Greek musiceitherIt is a bit shocking to think that Aeschylus and Sophocles wereperhapscontributors to an inferior artbut there seem to be grounds for the ingenious theoryEveryone who has been to a movie showknows how effective even crude pantomime can beBut make your pantomime a portrayal of moods and emotions rather than of eventsgive it visual beauty which will occasionally wring tears from anyone sensitive to lineand accompany it with music whose most complex rhythm and harmonic color are intensified by the stage pictureand you have an expression on a plane of the imagination where the introduction of a spoken word is like the creak of a piano pedalIf we can t lead the people back from the movies to plays can t we give them the modern balletThat is exactly what Kinney proposesHe wants a National Academy for Americawith resources equal to the hacking of the Metropolitan Opera HouseBig managers and opera authorities have already admitted that such an undertaking wouldif properly managedbe successfulCompared with the present interest in good ballet the interest in good music with which Theodore Thomas startedwas nothingBut it is a miracle if America does a thing like that in the right wayOur princes haveas a ruleneither good taste nor much public spiritOur race of artists thinkers mental heroes is small and largely uncourageousOur government accurately represents the most of our peoplewho still regard art either as immoral or entertaining and hence not worth the attention of sensible peopleHow bitterly we need missionaries like THE LITTLE REVIEW and the people who feel the same spirit But our case is far from hopelessThe good fighters among us are glad there is a lot still to doSuch visions give strength to our hewing arms as we cry room for our new imagesThe men who are cursed with the gift of the literal mind are

Prejudices The Flying Innby GKChestertonLane CompanyNew YorkGKChesterton really possesses a philosophybut it is a question whether he has ever shown a clear intellectual title to itHis method of asserting ownership is to abuse those who question either his right to possess it or the desirability of the philosophy itselfIn The Flying Inn MrChesterton does two thingsHe writes a most amusing criticism of modern tendencies the while he is defending his philosophy of Augustinian ChristianityIt may be news to some of MrChesterton s readers that he is a symbolist with a profound philosophy to expoundand I would never have guessed from his latest work that he was fighting over again the battle of StAugustine against the PelagiansBut this book recently fell into the hands of a more than usually industrious and erudite criticMrIsrael Solonand in a recent issue of The Friday Literary Review of The Chicago Evening PostMrSolon took the trouble to explain some of MrChesterton s symbolismThe general readerhowever and what a good thing it is does not care a red cent about the triumph of Augustinian Christianitywhile the unbiased student of religion knows that Pelagianisma healthy minded British heresy of about 400 a D which denied original sinwas a more reasonable proposition than the Christianity which it tried to displaceThe only real interest of MrChesterton s latest bookthenis in his criticisms of lifeand that interest arises from their humor rather than from their worthMrChesterton s theory of criticism is very simplePoke fun at everything you do not likeIf it is difficult to poke fun at it on account of its worth or dignity then misrepresent it firstThe present storyfor instancecovers the adventures of an Irishman who left the British navy and became a soldier of fortuneand an innkeeper whose inn is closed by a fanatical temperance advocate holding office under a very fussy pseudo liberal governmentThis personagewho is an amateur of religions and wishes to combine Mahomcdanism and Christianitydrives the innkeeper into vagabondageThe Irishman accompanies himand they carry the old inn sign and a keg of rum and a round cheese with themThey buy a donkey and cartand travel the neighborhood breaking up meetings in favor of temperancevegetarianismpolygamyand other absurdities advocated by the teetotal aristocratMost of the fooling is excellentbut some of it is very childishIt shows MrChesterton at his most characteristicHe dislikes all liberalismso the efforts of the present British government toward various forms of amelioration of bonds ecclesiasticalpuritanicand economicare satirized by the implication that the aristocrats of this story wish to re establish the Eastern vices of 40 The Little Reviewpolygamy and abstinence from wineHe dislikes the Ethical Societiesso he represents them as meeting in little tin halls and listening to fakers from the East preaching strange exotic doctrines in return for large feesHe dislikes the Jewsand so a particularly mean and futile character is painted very carefully as a Jew who mixes in British politics a thing which MrChesterton and his political allies seem to think should be forbidden by statuteIf we discount all thishoweverwe shall be able to derive a lot of enjoyment from MrChestertonIn particular we shall enjoy his songs against temperanceOne of them concerns Noah s views on drinkingOld Noahhe had an ostrich farmand fowls on the greatest scaleHe ate his egg with a ladle in an egg cup big as a pailAnd the soup he took was Elephant Soup and the fish he took was WhaleBut they all were small to the cellar he took when he set out to sailAnd Noahhe often said to his wife when he sat down to dine I don t care where the water goes if it doesn t go into the wineThe cataract of the cliff of heaven fell blinding off the brinkAs if it would wash the stars away as suds go down a sink The seven heavens came roaring down for the throats of hell to drinkAnd Noahhe cocked his eye and saidI t looks like rainI think The water has drowned the Matterhorn as deep as a Mendip mineBut I don t care where the water goes if it doesn t get into the wineAnd for other drinks than those of orthodox alcoholic content he has nothing but contemptWitness the following remarksTea is like the East he grows ingreat yellow Mandarinurbanity of mannerunconsciousness of sin

Flexner The Century CompanyNew York There can be no doubt whatever in the mind of any student of the evolution of civic conscience that the prominence now being given to the subject of prostitution is one of the most promising signs of our dayIt is inevitable in the first uncovering of what has been hidden for many generations that this prominence should be marred by much that is to be regrettedby much wild hysteriaand much morbid dwelling on erstwhile forbidden topicsBut in the main the knowledge by the people at large of the cess pools that lie below our civilization is the only starting point from which to set about the draining and cleaning up of these cess poolsAs DrFlexner points out repeatedly in this volumeit is public opinionand in the last analysisthat onlywhich determines the fate of prostitution in any given cityEven the most stringent laws are of comparatively little service when unsupported by an intelligent and watchful interest on the part of the people at largeAnd on what can an intelligent interest be founded except on knowledgeThe voices raised in protest the voice of Agnes Repplierfor instance belong surely to the protectedleisure class the class which sees no need for change since they have never known from personal experience that such problems existYet it is safe to say that for the great majority of the world s population the question of prostitution and its attendent train of diseasemiseryand degeneration is and has always been one of the most vital questions of lifeA single calmwisescientific booklike this of DrFlexner sgiven into the hands of our boys and girls of eighteenwould do quite as much goodand for many dispositions infinitely morethan a whole battery of moral lectureswarning vaguely against the wickedness of human nature and the allurements of sin Not that this book was written for boys and girlsFar from itIt was written for the serious student of the social evil by DrFlexner as representative of the Bureau of Social Hygiene of New York CityIt is an unprejudicedauthoritative statement of the present condition of prostitution in the various countries of Europeand is the result of an impartial and painstaking personal investigation which required two years of the time of an educational expertDrFlexner nowhere raises any question as to how far European experience is significant for Americabut it is inevitable that the reader should form certain conclusions of his ownMuch of the book is devoted to the relative merits of the two systems of handling prostitution now prevalent in Europe regulation and so called abolition The weight of evidence is overwhelmingly on the side of abolitionRegulation is left without a leg to stand onThishoweveris not a burning issue in AmericaThe New York Committee of Fifteen decidedyears agothat regulation does not regulate and such has been the general opinion in the United StatesBut the remainder of the book and much that is brought out in the discussion of regulation can be of great serviceThe Little Review It is impossible to summarize here a book so rich both in thought and materialBut one thing may be said for the encouragement of future readersThere is in this volume absolutely no trace of the hysteria so prevalent todayand on the other handno trace of the morbid dwelling on details from which even some of our official investigations have unfortunately not been freeThere is in the entire book not a detailed account of an individual case to turn the stomachYet the opinion of every prominent expert in Europe is givenand a calmscientific attitude is maintained throughoutWe areas Jane Addams has so aptly expressed itfacing an ancient evil with a new conscience and this book of DrFlexner s is the embodied voice of that conscienceThis is his last word on the subject In so far as prostitution is the outcome of ignorancelaws and police are powerlessonly knowledge will aidIn so far as prostitution is the outcome of mental or moral defectlaws and police are powerlessonly the intelligent guardianship of the state will availIn so far as prostitution is the outcome of natural impulses denied a legitimate expressiononly a rationalized social life will really forestall itIn so far as prostitution is due to alcoholto illegitimacyto broken homesto bad homesto low wagesto wretched industrial conditions to any or all of the particular phenomena respecting which the modern conscience is becoming sensitiveonly a transformation wrought by educationreligionsciencesanitationenlightened and far reaching statesmanship can effect a cureOur attitude towards prostitutionin so far as these factors are concernedcannot embody itself in a special remedial or repressive policyfor in this sense it must be dealt with as a part of the larger social problems with which it is inextricably entangledCivilization has stripped for a life and death wrestle with tuberculosisalcohol and other plaguesIt is on the verge of a similar struggle with the crasser forms of commercialized vice Sooner or later it must fling down the gauntlet to the whole horrible thingThis will be the real contesta contest that will tax the couragethe self denialthe faiththe resources of humanity to their uttermostEUNICE TIETJENSThe welfare of mankind is as much promoted by the mistakes and vanity of fools and knaves as by the virtuous activity of wise and good men The late Professor Churton Collins in The English Review The Little Review 43 The CriticsCritic MASCULINE AND FEMININE LITERATURE lately I read a review of Home and the reviewer says that it was probably written by a womangiving I forget what reason as to description of home lifeand details of that sortwhich no one but a woman could have written with such fidelity to truth But I couldn t believe it even before the truth came out the other dayHome is distinctly a man s storywritten by a manThe psychology of it is man psychologyunconscious of course and its appeal is more strongly to masculine than to feminine taste much as I hate to think they differ in literatureI have heard several men speak of it as one of the best stories they ever readand Imyselfthough liking itcould never become more than mildly enthusiasticTo be sureit is a great tale of adventureBut for whom is the great adventureAlan and Gerry go blithely about the world in pursuit of itAlixGerry s wifeafter taking a feeble little step in the direction of what was for her a stirring adventurereturns homechastenedand is properly punished by years of waiting for her husband to close up his small affairsHer great adventure was sitting at home rearing Gerry s childClem s seems to have been sitting at home waiting for Alan to get through roving and come back to herAnd never a comment to the effect that this should not have been perfectly soul satisfying to both of the womenand never a notionapparentlybut that they were richly rewarded for their waiting by being allowedto spend the rest of their lives caring for the two bold adventurersI couldn t believe a woman living in the twentieth century could even have imagined such stupiditiesI don t mean that Home isn t interestingas stories gobut it is the crudest kind of man psychology and will be as out of date in a few years as Clarissa Harlowe is nowI ve been wondering a great deal lately whether there is a masculine and feminine literature after one is grown upI know there was for me as a childWhen a story like Camp Mates began in Harper s Young People I regretted that it was not something by Lucy CLilliewho wrote of adorably nice little girlsBut possibly if I had ever gone out for long walks and camped for the day in the open as my own little lad does nowI too would have read Camp MatesA man not undistantly related to me by marriage confessed the other day that he was fondest of stories telling of castaways on desert islands It s a thing I d like to do myself have a try at an island he saideagerly With your wife I askedtentativelyHe noddedand gulped his dinnerand then immediately repented With no womanhe saidfirmly they bring civilizationand I d want it wild WellI don t blame himIt s appalling to think of how many men would measure up to a desert island test would procure by hook or crook some manner of sustenanceAnd I can think of fewvery few womenamong whom I do not include myselfwhom I should select as companions if I were thus strandedI meanof courseas far as their resourcefulness is concernedPerhaps that is whyin stories of adventurethe woman is left behindinevitably orif she is 44 The Little

staminaTH E EDUCATION OF GIRLS And speaking of training an interesting thing in March Atlantic about The Education of the Girl has set me thinkingHow am I going to bring up my daughterThe education of a boy iscompared to thata simple matterToo ridiculoustoothe answers to my query returned to me by different friends and relativesMake her a good girl says oneBut surelyBe goodfair maid let those who will be clever has been ridiculed to a timely demiseAnother said I hope I shall be able to bring up my daughter so that when she is grown she can persuade some nice man to take care of heras her mother did No mention is madeof courseof what happens if the plan miscarriesIt sometimes doesAnd it is too funny when one realizes that several decades agowhen absolutely no question was raised as to woman s spherehome and the rearing of children she received in college a severely classical or scientific trainingand nowwhen it is by no means admitted without argument that home is her one vocationnoted educators are recommending that women s colleges abolish Greek and Latin or treat them and science as purely secondary and take up domestic scienceeconomicsnursingetc in their placeHow can I tell beforehand which of the two my daughter is going to needI think of myselffilled to the brim with GreekLatinFrenchand Germanproducing in my early married life a distinctly leathery and most unpleasant pieor rushing to the doctor with my baby to have him treat a dreadful sore which turned out to be a mosquito biteand my tearful struggles with the sewing machine on my first shirtwaist which I christened a Dance on the Lawn for obvious reasons and I wonderNever would Iwillingly give up my classics and the joy they gave meBut a soupçon of domesticity would surely have done me no harmMiss Harknessin this articleis inclined to think that it does us all harmShe saysWould men ever get anywheredo you thinkif they fussed around with as many disconnected things as most women doAnd the worst of our case is that we are rather inclined to point with pride to what is really one of the most vicious habits of our sexBut in the meantime that daughter of mineSuppose she prefers to run a house and be the mother of six children Some women doand are wonderfully fitted for itWon t she be happier if she knows beforehand how to do it most efficientlyI hopeof courseshe will choosebesidesa career of her own but if she doesn t want toAnd to give both does mean a scattering of potentialities Which brings me back to the statement that the education of the modern girl is a complex ohbut a very complex problemYou remember Stevenson s poem to his wifeI speak of it in this connection because it throws light on one facet of the feminist problem which perhaps is not sufficiently illuminatedHe says TrustyduskyvividtrueWith eyes of gold and bramble dewSteel true and blade straightThe great artificer made my mate Steel trueandblade straightare epithets more often applied to menThe Little Review and indeed MrMcClurein speaking of MrsStevenson in his memoirssaysShe had many of the fine qualities that arc usually attributed to men rather than womena fair mindednessa large judgmenta robustinconsequential philosophy of life How thenif in seeking an ideal education for girlswe should dismissor at least diminishthe importance of a purely utilitarian aspect and look for something that will eventually ensure such qualitiesIfas the feminists urgethey are trying to raise men to a higher planewhy not apply a little of this passion for uplift to the education of women into noblerhigher attitudes Steel trueand blade straight I like the sound of thatThis education of the girl is getting to be an obsession with meEverything I read resolves itself into terms of girl

claimWellwe won t eitherso George is not so smart as he thinks he is GERMAN AMERICANS AND AMERICANS I have been greatly interested in an article in the May CenturyIt was by ProfEdward ARossof the University of Wisconsinthe title being The Germans in AmericaYou know whyof courseMy father was born in Germanyand came over in 1850About ten years ago Hugo Munsterberg had an article in the Atlantic on the same subjectin which he tried to explain the antagonism existing between native born Germans and AmericansHis argument summed itself up in the statement that the German considers the American no gentlemanand the American considers the German no gentlemanBut whyI was willing enough to believe him because of a curious experience of my childhoodI can remember the incident perfectlythough it is many years since it happenedI was in the fifth gradeand the girl who figured prominently therein her name was Siddonsby the wayand most appropriatelyfor she spelled tragedy to me had called out on the street to a little boy who was carrying my books home for me Aw Georgedo you like the DutchGeorge is going with a Dutchman George was certainly no cavalierfor he dropped my booksmumbled somethingand was offwhile I continued 46 The Little Reviewon my dazedbewildered waywondering what it was all aboutChildren learn so quickly to keep their deepest hurts to themselves that I doubt whether I should ever have mentioned it at home had it not been for this same bewildermentMy mother was indignantnotit seemsbecause I had had names flung at me in scornbut because it was the wrong name You are not DutchYou are Germanand proud of it she saidholding her head a little higherPressed for an explanationshe revealed that my father had been born in Germany but you must nevernever be ashamed of that she added earnestly Your father was an educatedcultured gentleman I was then taken into ourlittle library with its crowded shelves climbing to the ceilingand shown volumes of SchillerGoetheLessing in GermanTauchnitz editions of the great English writersbooks of philosophy and historyand shelves full of HaydenBeethovenand MozartHe was a graduate of a German university said motherand you must pay no attention to these foolish children whose parents never even saw an American university All very wellbut had my mother been German herselfNoindeedso she could hardly realize what it meant to be an alien and an outcastMany times during that hard yearwhile the detested Siddons crossed my unwilling path would I have bartered an educated and cultured German forbear for any kind of Americanbe his lowly occupation what it mightLater that year a little French girlDunois by namecame into our gradeJoy Here was another alien who would be a companion in miseryBut to my great surprise she was courted and flattered by this same Siddons and the two became bosom friendsThe Dunois père kept a smallunsavory restaurant in a side streetbut the glamour of his Frenchness was an aureole compared to the stigma of my Dutchness That is still something of a mystery to mebut the article in the Century explains in part the cause of this attitude among unthinking AmericansProfRoss says Between 1839 and 1845 numerous old Lutheransresenting the attempt of their king to unite Lutheran and Reformed faithsmigrated hitherThe political reaction in the German states after the revolution of 1830and again after the revolution of 1848brought tens of thousands of liberty lovers And again he says of these political exiles that they included many men of unusual attainments and characterThese university professorsphysiciansjournalistsand even aristocrats aroused many of their fellow countrymen to feel a pride in German cultureand they left a stamp of political idealismsocial radicalism and religious skepticism which is slow to be effaced Possibly one reason for American antagonism to these earliersuperior settlers was the fact that they did somewhat despise American culture and hold rather closely to their own German ways of thinkingI remember in my childhoodin my own homethat although we had Harpers Young People and StNicholaswe also had English ChatterboxI rather fancy as a corrective to Americanisms to be found in the other magazinesYou know Germans in their own land today do not wish for American governesses to teach their children English it must be EnglishwomenAll our toys were sent for from the beloved Fatherlandand beautiful toys they weretooWe had a system of Froebel with all his methods established in our own homelong before the middle westThe Little Review 47ern cities dreamed of a public kindergartenThis deep distrust of American methods and culture could not help but impress Americans unfavorably they would retaliate with the cry of DutchmanperhapsProfRoss goes on to say Germans brought a languageliteratureand social customs of their ownso that although when scattered they Americanized with great rapidity wherever they were strong enough to maintain church and schools in their own tongue they were slow to take the American stamp So much for those earlier immigrantsThe case is vastly different with the later tides of immigration After 1870 he writes the Teutonic overflow was prompted by economic motivesand such a migration shows little persistence in flying the flag of its national cultureNumbers camelittle instructed In the words of a German AmericanKnortznine tenths of all German immigrants come from humble circumstances and have had only an indifferent schoolingWhoeverthereforeexpects pride in their German descent from these people who owe everything to their new country and nothing to their fatherlandsimply expects too much Wellthen If they no longer pride themselves on being Germanand are easily assimilated by the second generationwe should expect to see the slight stigma of being of German descent removed by this timeBut is itNot long ago I had occasion to attend a Bach revival and the beautiful passion music was played and sungOne of my friends remarkedYou have to get used to this music before you can appreciate it and I retorted condescendinglyI don t I have heard it from childhoodThis is the kind of music we sing in the Lutheran church This same friend laterguiding my tottering steps through the mazes and pitfalls of society in the most aristocratic suburb of New York said hesitatinglyI don t think I d mention itespecially to people in generalthat I was a Lutheranif I were you Of course I was seized immediately with a perfectly natural desire to talk of it in season and out to everyone I metWhy notWhy not be a Lutheran as naturally as an Episcopalian or a Methodist Wellthey are mostly Germansyou see But I don t seeand I never have seenalthough this articleenlightening and interestinggoes nearer to the reasons for such an attitude than anything else I have ever readREJECTIONS BY EDITORS Never again shall I feel a sense of shame and humiliation on receiving my rejected MSand the printed slipI have always suspected that it was on account of the editorslack of taste and discrimination now I am sure of itIndeedI m not quite sure but that it argues more to be rejected than to be acceptedI m beginning to be proud of itRead Henry Sydnor Harrison s article in the April Atlantic Adventures with the Editors and see if you don t feel the same way Orperhapsyou ve never been rejected with the added ignominy of the printed slipIf sodon t read thisit is not for youBut all ye rejected ones take renewed hope from this statement that an editoractually an editor himselfhas madeI think I can tell you why editors so frequently reject the earlier and often the best work of writersit is because any new writer who sends in first class work sends in work that is very different from what editors are used to The Little Review It reminds me of a time when I wrotemaliciouslyI admitto a certain well known magazineto tell its editors a story they had printed by a renowned author had been cribbed entireunconsciouslypossiblyfrom an old classicand I told themtooif they would prefer to print original storiesI had one on handI got back such a deliciously solemn reply regretting the unconscious plagiarism and asking me to send on any story I hadI did not do sofor the good and sufficient reason that I had already sent it to them several weeks previouslyand had had it rejected without commentNo doubt it deserved to be rejectedevery one else did the same with itTo be sureone kindly editor took the pains to tell me whypersonallyThe trouble is he saidthere isn t enough storyYour character drawing is both careful and sincerehowever So it must have been dull to deserve anything like thatI wish we could hear a little more of the experiences of those poor rejectedwho never do get over the wall as MrHarrison terms itI imagine it would be both illuminating and ludicrousAndoh the happy moments I had on reading ESMartin s commentsin Lifeon MrHarrison s articleMrHarrison makes the charge that magazines will print poor stories of well known writers in preference to good stories of the unknownand MrMartin s response isIt does not follow that the editors were wrong because they did not buy MrHarrison s tales before QueedMaybe they were not more than average storiesBut after Queed they were stories by the author of Queed Queed pulled all MrHarrison s past tales out of the ruckand put them in the runningIt was hardly fair to expect the editors to pick them for winners beforehand What then are editors forif not to pick winners And MrHarrison says himself that Queed was rejected by two publishersProbably it was hardly fair to expect the publishers to pick such a winner in advanceWethe rejectedhave always humbly thought that was their occupation their raison d êtreAnd if MrHarrison s short stories were not more than average stories doesn t it prove his contention that average poor stories by the known are more acceptable to editors than good ones by the unknownAt least I am going to think soand some day I shall write an article on the lofty distinction of being rejectedMHPThe witty mind is the most

already more priests than worshippers in our TempleIf you are going to beone of many I question the raison d etre of TH E LITTLE REVIEWYour debut was a revelationa new worda rejuvenating breeze in the tepid atmosphere of our periodical pressIt was a wonderful numberall fresh and beautifuleven the one or two grotesque pieces that had smuggled in drowned in the mass of splendorjust as the heavy colors of the rainbow soften in the powerful symphony of the spectrumNowfranklywould you sign your name under every article of the April REVIEWI hope notYou have turned your temple into a parliament of dissonancesyou have admitted Victorian ladies and sentimental crucifiers of Nietzscheyou have even polluted your pages with an anti Bathhouse tiradeThen that cacophony of personal lettersI blushed at the sight of these tokens of familiarity and tappings over your shoulder on the part of the benevolent readersI wished to shout to the Misses Jones to keep off the altarlest they besmirch your

me your critic is wrong in speaking of juvenility or the restrictive tone of the magazineIt s exactly that which gives TH E LITTLE REVIEW an excuse for beingthat it is not like all other magazines with their cutand dried precision and their Thus saith the Lord attitude toward thingsAs time goes on I think it will be wise to enlarge the scope more of dramamore of The Little Review musicmore of world politics and scienceYou will thus get away from the aesthetic tendency which your critic mentionsI enjoyed the Wells discussion so muchAnd yet Miss Trevor doesn t advance any real argumentsIt s very easy to call people muddleheaded and vaguely sentimentalbut an appeal to the upbuilding of character isn t slushyI m inclined to agree withMMthough I d like to hear an advanced not a hysterical argument on the subjectI m willing to be convinced of the other sidebut assuredly itwould take something stronger and sterner and more logical than Miss Trevor The suggestion about enlarging our scope
