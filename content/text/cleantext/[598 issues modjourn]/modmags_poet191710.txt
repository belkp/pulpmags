year to its Fund The magazine began under a five year endowment which expired Sept 30th IÇI7 and although the endowment has been partly resubscribed for another period this Fund is insufficient and expenses are constantly increasing The art of poetry requires if it is to advance not only special sympathy from a discriminating public but also endowment similar to that readily granted to the other arts All who believe in the general purpose and policy of this magazine and recognize the need and value of such an organ of the art are invited to assist thus in maintaining it VOL XI No I   OCTOBER 1917  CANTICLE OF THE RACE  SONG OF MEN  O W beautiful are the bodies of men The agonists Their hearts beat deep as a brazen gong For their strength s behests Their arms are lithe as a seasoned thong In games or tests When they run or box or swim the long Sea wave crests With their slender legs and their hips so strong And their rounded chests  I know a youth who raises his arms Over his head He laughs and stretches and flouts alarms Of flood or fire   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He springs renewed from a lusty bed To his youth s desire He drowses for April flames outspread In his soul s attire  The strength of men is for husbandry Of woman s flesh Worker soldier magistrate Of city or realm Artist builder wrestling Fate Lest it overwhelm The brood or the race or the cherished state They sing at the helm When the waters roar and the waves are great And the gale is fresh  There are two miracles women and men Yea four there be A woman s flesh and the strength of a man And God s decree And a babe from the womb in a little span Ere the month be ten Their rapturous arms entwine and cling In the depths of night He hunts for her face for his wondering And her eyes are bright A woman s flesh is soil but the spring Is man s delight   Edgar Lee Masters  SONG OF WOMEN  How beautiful is the flesh of women Their throats their breasts My wonder is a flame which burns A flame which rests It is a flame which no wind turns And a flame which quests  I know a woman who has red lips Like coals which are fanned Her throat is tied narcissus it dips From her white rose chin Her throat curves like a cloud to the land Where her breasts begin I close my eyes when I put my hand On her breast s white skin  The flesh of woman is like the sky When bare is the moon Rhythm of backs hollow of necks And sea shell loins I know a woman whose splendors vex Where the flesh joins A slope of light and a circumflex Of clefts and coigns She thrills like the air when silence wrecks An ended tune   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  These are things not made by hands in the earth Water and fire The air of heaven and springs afresh And love s desire And a thing not made is a woman s flesh Sorrow and mirth She tightens the strings on the lyric lyre And she drips the wine Her breasts bud out as pink and nesh As buds on the vine For fire and water and air are flesh And love is the shrine  SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT  How beautiful is the human spirit In its vase of clay It takes no thought of the chary dole Of the light of day It labors and loves as it were a soul Whom the gods repay With length of life and a golden goal At the end of the way  There are souls I know who arch a dome And tunnel a hill They chisel in marble and fashion in chrome   Edgar Lee Masters  And measure the sky They find the good and destroy the ill And they bend and ply The laws of nature out of a will While the fates deny  I wonder and worship the human spirit When I behold Numbers and symbols and how they reach Through steel and gold A harp a battle ship thought and speech And an hour foretold It ponders its nature to turn and teach And itself to mould  The human spirit is God no doubt In flesh made the word Jesus Beethoven and Raphael And the souls who heard Beyond the rim of the world the swell Of an ocean stirred By a Power on the waters inscrutable There are souls who gird Their loins in faith that the world is well In a faith unblurred How beautiful is the human spirit The flesh made the word  Edgar Lee Masters   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE PRICE  What is it you buy with so much blood And so much sorrow  A thing but darkly understood We buy Tomorrow  Why is it you sow with blasting flame To reap with passion  When was it then that a good thing came In an easy fashion  Have you not also fallen and sinned You are sin to the marrow  We are but as straws that show the wind As blades to the harrow  Iniquity iniquity Though much befriended Yet it shall perish utterly It shall be ended  Do you see then an end of wars An end of iveeping  We see the reticent ranks of stars Shine on our sleeping   William Rose Benêt  We hear the great earth sigh and turn And the seas sighing And the angry sunsets flame and burn With old dreams dying  But earlier than the early dawn So chill so grayly Comes that which never is withdrawn Comes to us daily  Comes to us after every mood Of pain or passion The certitude the certitude Of what we fashion  Are you so devout who never trod Neath spire or steeple  But we have spoken with our God The God of the People  Our blood the dye his robe the sod That we lie under W e have heard the still voice of our God Through flame and thunder  What are these wild ivords of some change You bring to being  W e only know it shall be strange Beyond foreseeing   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  We have lain down we have stood up Past all dissembling With Death with Death We have quaffed the cup The cup of trembling  So we but whisper brokenly As dead men do The great strange things that are to be That shall come true  For we are blinded and we see Deaf and have ears Despoiled and co heirs perfectly Of coming years  Life higher than we ever thought Deeper than death This with our life blood we have bought With our vain breath  Over fire curtained slime of the fen Through insensate clamor We have heard the building thoughts of men Hammer and hammer  We have heard the splitting of codes apart The ripping of glamour Like colored curtains and Man s strong heart Hammer and hammer   William Rose Benêt  We have heard the sledges of a state Beyond our hoping Thunder and thunder We are great Who once were groping  Out of the slag and fume of the pit We have seen uprearing A blinding witness because of it We are done with fearing  Out of the bowels of Hell on earth W e have seen upstraining A winged archangel of rebirth Too strong for chaining  Now ours is the strength ours is the might Yea by these powers Ours is the earth for light and right And the future ours  Who have rent our hearts our blood outpoured Who have drunk all sorrow Who have found our strength walked with our Lord And bought Tomorrow  William Rose Benêt   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  AUTUMN LEAVES  MID OCTOBER  Leaves whirl about my feet Leaves leaves dance over my head Brown leaves And their madness and love of death blow through my he Oh the perfume of these drifting golden leaves  What wine can stain the soul with redder glory Than this wild sudden thirst for sudden death  They rise like clouds of incense From swift swinging golden censers Clouds and clouds And the western sky is a glow of light As yellow and white as the face of a Christian saint  Autumn autumn I will not live I ll go now now with all my memories and my joys  I will not live To have them blown Like ashes from an altar by capricious winds   Helen Louise Birch  UP IN THE HILLS  The earth smells old and warm and mellow and all things lie at peace  too serenely lie here under the white oak tree and know the splendid flight of hours all blue and gay sundrenched and still  The dogs chase rabbits through the hazel brush  I hear now close at hand their eager cries now swift receding into the distance leaving a trail behind them in the clear sweet air shrill bursts of joy  There s something almost drowsy in that waning clamor It brings the stillness nearer and a sense of being bodily at  one with the old warm earth Blessedly at one with the fragrant laughing sun baked earth At one with its sly delightful wicked old laughter  CAN THIS BE ALL  Can this be all Can this unfinished thing be called complete And I be left to face it thus forever Forever to twist and turn remould and tint anew  ARTIST  Bird whose eyes I cannot see Whose flight is beautiful From your wings in passing Bright plumage is drifting down to us   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MUSIC  The house is still The very pictures on the walls have lost their painted  meaning The place seems new and strangely vacant I see the old brown Chinese figure in the panel facing me  he has a look of stupid blankness that is utterly new The three big dogs asleep here at my feet What cabalistic word will be required to rouse them from  their almost deathlike slumbers So still so still the house My heart so still And I might lift my head and speak and move about and  change all this But that I know what thing has made it so Whose absence the place can feel Whose voice is heard no more And I think of the great free sounding melodies that filled  the room Great silhouettes that passed And clear full living tones that live no longer  This is the lifeless vacuum left by the passage of the storm  FOREWARNED  What have I to do with the world What has the world to do with me   Helen Louise Birch  Who know now that in the end I must have traffic Only with the things of my own spirit  PROPHETS  Prophet of joy Before ever the deed lived you came  Be the fulfilment what it was I do prostrate myself for love and lay here at your feet my heart of thanks  Prophet of evil It is now your hour  A VOICE BREAKS IN UPON THE SILENCE  Swiftly Secretly Silently Winding through some unsensed aerial channel With subtle solace and challenging it comes Suddenly I know that it is there Alert Alert Arise  Whatever the day bring forth that will I greet Having drunk divinely divinely of the dawn  Helen Louise Birch   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TH E SOAP BOX  This my song is made for Kerensky  O market square O slattern place Is glory in your slack disgrace Plump quack doctors sell their pills Gentle grafters sell brass watches Silly anarchists yell their ills Shall we be as weird as these In the breezes nod and wheeze  Heaven s mass is sung Tomorrow s mass is sung In a spirit tongue By wind and dust and birds The high mass of liberty While wave the banners red Sung round the soap box A mass for soldiers dead  When you leave your faction in the once loved hall Like a true American tongue lash them all Stand then on the corner under starry skies And get you a gang of the worn and the wise The soldiers of the Lord may be squeaky when they rally The soldiers of the Lord are a queer little army But the soldiers of the Lord before the year is through Will gather the whole nation recruit all creation To smite the hosts abhorred and all the heavens renew   Vachel Lindsay  Enforcing with

box Exiles Troops in files Generals in uniform Mujiks in their smocks And holy maiden soldiers who have cut away their locks  All the people of the world little folk and great Are tramping through the Russian Soul as through a city gate As though it were a street of stars that paves the shadowy deep And mighty Tolstoi leads the van along the stairway steep  But now the people shout Hail to Kerensky he hurled the tyrants out And this my song is made for Kerensky Prophet of the world wide intolerable hope There on the soap box seasoned dauntless There amid the Russian celestial kaleidoscope Flags of liberty rags and battlesmoke  Moscow Chicago Come let us praise battling Kerensky Bravo bravo Comrade Kerensky thunderstorm and rainbow Comrade Kerensky bravo bravo   HOW SAMSON BORE AWAY THE GATES OF  GAZA  A Negro Sermon  Once in a night as black as ink She drove him out when he would not drink Round the house there were men in wait Asleep in rows by the Gaza gate But the Holy Spirit was in this man Like a gentle wind he crept and ran  It is midnight said the big town clock  He lifted the gates up post and lock The hole in the wall was high and wide When he bore away old Gaza s pride  Into the deep of the night The bold Jack Johnson Israelite  Samson the Judge the Nazarite  The air was black like the smoke of a dragon Samson s heart was as big as a wagon He sang like a shining golden fountain He sweated up to the top of the mountain He threw down the gates with a noise like judgment And the quails all ran with the big arousement  But he wept I must not love tough queens And spend on them my hard earned means I told that girl I would drink no more Therefore she drove me from her door Oh sorrow   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Sorrow I cannot hide 0 Lord look down from your chariot side You made me Judge and I am not wise 1 am weak as a sheep for all my size  Let Samson  Be coming  Into your mind  The moon shone out the stars were gay Pie saw the foxes run and play He rent his garments he rolled around In deep repentance on the ground  Then he felt a honey in his soul Grace abounding made him whole Then he saw the Lord in a chariot blue The gorgeous stallions whinnied and flew The iron wheels hummed an old hymn tune And crunched in thunder over the moon And Samson shouted to the sky My Lord my Lord is riding high Like a steed he pawed the gates with his hoof He rattled the gates like rocks on the roof And danced in the night On the mountain top Danced in the deep of the night The Judge the holy Nazarite Whom ropes and chains could never bind   Vache Lindsay  Let Samson Be coming Into your mind  Whirling his arms like a top he sped His long black hair flew around his head Like an outstretched net of silky cord Like a wheel of the chariot of the Lord  Let Samson Be coming Into your mind  Samson saw the sun anew He left the gates in the grass and dew He went to a county seat a nigh Found a harlot proud and high Philistine that no man could tame Delilah was her lady name Oh sorrow Sorrow She was too wise She cut off his hair She put out his eyes  Let Samson Be coming Into your mind  Vachel Lindsay   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ON THE ROAD  HROLF S THRALL HIS SONG  There be five things to a man s desire Kine flesh roof tree his own fire Clean cup of sweet wine from goat s hide And through dark night one to lie beside  Four things poor and homely be Hearth fire white cheese own roof tree True mead slow brewed with brown malt But a good woman is savor and salt  Plow shove deep through gray loam Hack sword hack for straw thatch home Guard buckler guard both beast and human God send true man his true woman  DIFFERENCE  There was one who hated Then came to comprehend It is too late I do not care How very low he bend  There was one who loved me I paid the punctual debt  Willard Wattl  I cannot quite remember Yet cannot quite forget  There was one I died for Several years ago How helpless seems a summer nest Drifted full of snow  A SONG OF NO CONSEQUENCE  This too delicious burden This too persistent urge This aching and this beauty And the answer of her breast This is her glowing guerdon And this my utter rest  Take loveliness and wonder Take splendor and take pain Clean lightning and brave thunder The silver slant of rain And one white flower thereunder That lifts her face again  Love love love love The morning star is slain   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  HEAVEN  Ah God that love should be  Another road to pain  And beauty as it blossoms By its own terror slain  Still if death were not Another way to love There were little need of heaven That sages whisper of  THE BUILDER  Smoothing a cypress beam With a scarred hand I saw a carpenter In a far land  Down past the fiat roofs Poured the white sun But still he bent his back The patient one  And I paused surprised In that queer place  To find an old man With a haunting face   Willard Wattles  Who art thou carpenter Of the bowed head And what buildest thou Heaven he said  DING DONG BELL  Ashes to ashes dust to dust Lords and ladies and loves and lust Gray old mothers in the sun Men grown listless when work is done Ashes to ashes the folded tent The pitcher shattered the wonder spent  Ashes to ashes dust and rest Blazoned glory but sleep is best Once there was clinging and a white breast small But lying alone is best of all Overhead the dead stars sweep Night and ashes dust and sleep  Willard Wattles   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TO A PORTRAIT OF WHISTLER IN THE BROOKLYN ART MUSEUM  What waspish whim of Fate Was this that bade you here Hold dim unhonored state No single courtier near  Is there of all who pass No choice discerning few To poise the ribboned glass And gaze enwrapt on you  Sword soul that from its sheath Laughed leaping to the fray How calmly underneath Goes Brooklyn on her way  Quite heedless of that smile Half devil and half god Your quite unequalled style The airy heights you trod  Ah could you from earth s breast Come back to take the air What matter here for jest Most exquisite and rare  But since you may not come Since silence holds you fast   Eleanor Rogers Cox  Since all your quips are dumb And all your laughter past  I give you mine instead  And something with it too That Brooklyn leaves unsaid Your meed of homage due  Ah Prince you smile again My faith the court is small I know dear James but then It s I or none at all  WHISTLER S WHITE GIRL  She heard the whisper of the stars She heard the falling of the dew And all the untrod virgin ways Of Beauty s self she knew  And when the moon lay silver white Along the meadows and the streams She walked across the night to him Upon a bridge of dreams  And as upon his eyelids there She shone so wonder white to see What could he give her more or less Than immortality  Eleanor Rogers Cox   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  LYRICS  YOUTH SONG  I wish I were old now And maybe content I d look back the long way My footsteps were bent And say Tis all done now What odds how it went  For all would look smooth then And most would look gay And Oh I was sure then And strong then I d say And show the wild young things My wise travelled way  I d have naught to strive for And no thoughts to form But how to rest easy And how to sleep warm And Pity the poor souls Abroad in the storm  I wish I were old now With living put by And peace on the hearthstone   Margaret Widdemer  And peace in the sky But Oh to be young now But young now they cry  VAIN HIDING  I said I shall find peace now for my love has never been Here in the little room in the quiet place  The walls shall not quiver around me nor fires begin And I shall forget his voice and perhaps his face And be still for a little space  But the thought of my love beat wild against the silencing doors There in the quivering air in the throbbing room Till his step strode quick and light against the echoing  floors And the light of his voice was there for the placid gloom And his presence a shed perfume  So I said There is no peace more for the place can never be Where the thought of him cannot come cannot burn me through For the thought of his touch is my flesh and his voice is a  voice in me And what is the use of all you may say and do When love is a part of you   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I DID NOT KNOW  I did not know that I should miss you So silver soft your loving came There were no trumpets down the dawning There were no leaping tides of flame  Only a peace like still rain falling On a tired land with drought foredone Only a warmth like light soft lying On a shut place that had not sun  I did not know that I should miss you I only miss you day and night Stilly as earth would miss the rainfall Always as earth would miss the light  PRESCIENCE  I went to sleep smiling I wakened despairing Where was my soul On what terror path faring What thing shall befall me  M By midnight or noon  What does my soul know That I shall know soon  Margaret Widdemer   EGO DOMINUS TUUS  Hìc  On the grey sand beside the shallow stream Under your old wind beaten tower where still A lamp burns on beside the open book That Michael Robartes left you walk in the moon And though you have passed the best of life still trace Enthralled by the unconquerable delusion Magical shapes  Ule  By the help of an image I call to my own opposite summon all That I have handled least least looked upon  Hie  And I would find myself and not an image  Ule  That is our modern hope and by its light We have lit upon the gentle sensitive mind And lost the old nonchalance of the hand Whether we have chosen chisel pen or brush We are but critics or but half create Timid entangled empty and abashed Lacking the countenance of our friends   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Hie  And yet The chief imagination of Christendom Dante Alighieri so utterly found himself That he has made that hollow face of his More plain to the mind s eye than any face But that of Christ  Ule  And did he find himself Or was the hunger that had made it hollow A hunger for the apple on the bough Most out of reach and is that spectral image The man that Lapo and that Guido knew I think he fashioned from his opposite An image that might have been a stony face Staring upon a bedouin s horse hair roof From doored and windowed cliff or half upturned Among the coarse grass and the camel dung He set his chisel to the hardest stone Being mocked by Guido for his lecherous life Derided and deriding driven out To climb that stair and eat that bitter bread He found the unpersuadable justice he found The most exalted lady loved by a man  Hie  Yet surely there are men who have made their art Out of no tragic war lovers of life   William Butler Yeats  Impulsive men that look for happiness And sing when they have found it  Ule  No not sing For those that love the world serve it in action Grow rich popular and full of influence And should they paint or write still it is action The struggle of the fly in marmalade The rhetorician would deceive his neighbors The sentimentalist himself while art Is but a vision of reality What portion in the world can the artist have Who has awakened from the common dream But dissipation and despair  Hie  And yet No one denies to Keats love of the world Remember his deliberate happiness  Ule  His art is happy but who knows his mind I see a school boy when I think of him With face and nose pressed to a sweet shop window For certainly he sank into his grave His senses and his heart unsatisfied And made being poor ailing and ignorant Shut out from all the luxury of the world   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The ill bred son of a livery stable keeper Luxuriant song  Hie  Why should you leave the lamp Burning alone beside an open book And trace these characters upon the sands A style is found by sedentary toil And by the imitation of great masters  Ule  Because I seek an image not a book Those men that in their writings are most wise Own nothing but their blind stupified hearts I call to the mysterious one who yet Shall walk the wet sands by the edge of the stream And look most like me being indeed my double And prove if all imaginable things The most unlike being my anti self And standing by these characters disclose All that I seek and whisper it as though He were afraid the birds who cry aloud Their momentary cries before it is dawn Would carry it away to blasphemous men  William Butler Yeats  COMMENT  THESE FIVE YEARS  IT H the present number POETRY celebrates its fifth birthday and begins its eleventh volume and sixth year The occasion seems appropriate for a few changes either advisable or necessary In the former class are the new cover the inside table of contents and a few slight typographical differences which our old friends will note In the latter class are the changes in price and in paper required by the heavily increased cost of all materials and expenses during this period of war  The present number inaugurates also what might be called the second period of our history since the magazine began under a five year endowment which expired with the September number and will continue it is hoped under a second similar endowment of which about two thirds has been already subscribed Thus we may have reached the psychological moment for confidential reminiscence and examination of conscience That searching question What hast thou done with thy stewardship may well demand an answer W e have assumed to be the organ of a great art the exhibition place for its best current products We have demanded as the poets right and spent for their benefit or at least tried to over five thousand a year of our guarantors money besides a smaller amount from subscribers and advertisers In so doing we have placed before the people indeed we have uttered with a loud voice the claim of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  poetry and the artists who practice it to that public recognition of sympathy and financial support which is granted unquestioningly and in lavish measure to the other arts  Five thousand a year may not be much money compared with the millions spent annually in this country for the endowment of painting and sculpture through exhibition space and dates commissions prizes and scholarships and of music through orchestral and operatic associations music schools etc Our prizes three hundred or so a year are very small compared with the three thousand given annually at a single exhibition in Pittsburgh the nineteen hundred in Chicago s autumn exhibition and similar amounts in other cities And though scholarships are numerous for promising students in the other arts and the American Academy at Rome is an over luxurious endowment for them no one has yet offered a poet s travelling scholarship through this magazine or any other or any university Still five thousand a year is a good deal as a starter for any project and for five years POETRY has been privileged to spend it by way of maintaining its proud demands for the art  It seemed a good deal to the frugal minded founder of the magazine one June day of 1911 when Mr H C Chatfield Taylor novelist historian and enlightened lover of the arts proposed to her the financial scheme on the basis of which a poets magazine might be published I had been saying that the art needed an organ of its own that the poets got from the ordinary magazines merely page end spaces and few of those and from the public merely neglect or ridicule  Incredible though this seems today yet so it was   These Five Years  I agree with you he said that the situation is desperate and something must be done Perhaps it s up to you if you choose to undertake it I believe you can get a hundred men and women in Chicago to give fifty dollars a year each for five years Anyway I ll promise to head the list and do what I can to help you  So the would be editor started on an adventure which proved far less formidable than it seemed less formidable and more interesting Her office interviews with men prominent in the commercial and professional life of the greatest inland city brought her many an agreeable surprise She had expected them to laugh at the project so new and seemingly absurd on the contrary most of them received it in the highest spirit of idealism often giving back her arguments better than she could state them herself Accustomed to new and hazardous enterprises requiring to the utmost vision and daring they were not daunted by this little venture for the Cinderella of the arts and willingly put their names on its roll of honor In some cases she left their offices as if on wings newly inspired for a high purpose and the whole experience brought home to her the fact that the best and most imaginative minds of the country through the formative era that may be passing with this war have gone largely perhaps chiefly into big business nor is this strange when we consider all that had to be done through the formative period of a great continental nation  Thus the hundred guarantors were secured more easily than anyone had expected and their loyalty has never wavered Since one or two critics have printed their sus   POETRY A M a sazine of Verse  picion that POETRY has been run in a spirit of compromise with the inferred tastes of its guarantors this may be the occasion to state emphatically that never by word or deed has any guarantor attempted to influence the editorial policy of the magazine Indeed they have been as a rule over fearful of seeming to interfere by the expression even of friendly criticism the editor would have welcomed more opinionating from them than she has ever received The editorial policy of POETRY for good or ill has been the work of its editors with the occasional assistance of its advisory committee Its guarantors are guiltless  The project became public property with the publication of a first page article in the Chicago Tribune one Sunday of November 1911 We were discovered the guarantor list was not complete but the names were of a number and quality to inspire confidence Toward the end they rolled in rapidly and my only regret has been that I did not keep on while the scheme had such momentum instead of stopping with an hundred names or so We could use to the advantage of the art more money than we have ever had  The next point of attack was the poets I remember wondering with some misgivings whether they would respond as gracefully as the guarantors During the summer of 1912 the following circular accompanied in some cases by personal letters was sent to many poets American and English  Poetry A Magazine of Verse is to be published for the encouragement of the art More than one hundred persons have generously pledged subscriptions amounting to five thousand dollars annually for five years to make this experiment possible Besides this two hundred and fifty dollars will be awarded in one or two cash  These Five Years  prizes for the best poem or poems published during the first year and at least one other prize has been partly promised  The success of this first American effort to encourage the production and appreciation of poetry as the other arts are encouraged by endowment now depends on the poets We offer them  First a chance to be heard in their own place without the limitations imposed by the popular magazine In other words while the ordinary magazines must minister to a large public little interested in poetry this magazine will appeal to and it may be hoped will develop a public primarily interested in poetry as an art as the highest most complete human expression of truth and beauty  Second within space limitations imposed at present by the small size of our monthly sheaf from sixteen to twenty four pages the size of this we hope to print poems of greater length and of more intimate and serious character than the other magazines can afford to use All kinds of verse will be considered narrative dramatic lyric quality alone being the test of acceptance Certain numbers may be devoted entirely to a single poem or a group of poems by one person except for a few editorial pages of comment and review  Third besides the prize or prizes above mentioned we shall pay contributors The rate will depend on the subscription list and will increase as the receipts increase for this magazine is not intended as a money maker but as a public spirited effort to gather together and enlarge the poet s public and to increase his earnings If we can raise the rate paid for verse until it equals that paid for paintings etchings statuary representing as much ability time and reputation we shall feel that we have done something to make it possible for poets to practice their art and be heard In addition we should like to secure as many prizes and as large as are offered to painters and sculptors at the annual exhibitions in our various cities  In order that this effort may be recognized as just and necessary and may develop for this art a responsive public we ask the poets to send us their best verse We promise to refuse nothing because it is too good whatever be the nature of its excellence We shall read with special interest poems of modern significance but the most classic subject will not be declined if it reaches a high standard of quality  We wish to show to an ever increasing public the best that can be done to day in English verse We hope to begin monthly publication in November or December 1912 at the low subscription rate of 1 50 a year We ask that writers of verse will be inter  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ested enough to contribute their best work and that all who love the art will subscribe A kind of declaration of principles and purposes was this circular and on the whole we think our worst enemy would admit that the magazine has lived up to it If we have not yet been able to raise the rate paid for verse until it equals that paid for paintings etchings statuary representing as much ability time and reputation that millenial ambition is still ours and we are ready to fulfil it whenever some miraculous increase in our endowment subscription list or volume of advertising makes it possible In one respect we have surpassed that summer s expectations instead of from sixteen to twenty four pages we now print over fifty  One of the promptest and most cordial responses came from Ezra Pound then as now in London In a long letter of August 18th 1912 he wrote  I am interested and your scheme so far as I understand it is not only sound but the only possible method   But Can you teach the American poet that poetry is an art an art with a technique with media an art that must be in constant flux a constant change of manner if it is to live Can you teach him that it is not a pentametric echo of the sociological dogma printed in last year s magazines Maybe anyhow you have your work before you   If I can be of any use in keeping you or the magazine in touch with whatever is most dynamic in artistic thought either here or in Paris as much of it as comes to me and I do see nearly everyone that matters I shall be glad to do so  I send you all that I have in my desk an over elaborate Imagiste affair and a note on the Whistler exhibit  This letter connecting us up so sympathetically with London and Paris was received with joy Mr Pound was at once appointed foreign correspondent of POETRY a proud   These Five Years  but unremunerative office which in spite of volcanic upheavals now and then he still holds  Other poets also welcomed the project with enthusiasm Mr Ficke sent us the beautiful double sonnet on Poetry which opened our first number Miss Amy Lowell who was just preparing her first book for the press promised Sept 7th to send us some poems later adding  It is a most excellent undertaking and ought to do much to foster poetry which has a hard time to get itself published now  And Mr Lindsay wrote Sept 18th  Thank you indeed for the invitation to contribute to the new magazine I am indeed eager to make good with such a group and three times interested in such an Illinois enterprise  And six weeks later Oct 29th he sent us General Booth which led off our fourth number January 1913  By this time Alice Corbin Henderson had assumed the associate editorship of the magazine so that from the first her brilliant mind with its high poetic intuition and keen critical sense was devoted to the project The connection has been less immediate during the past year but we hope that Mrs Henderson s rapidly improving health may enable her soon to resume it When Mr Henry B Fuller Miss Edith Wyatt and Mr H C Chatfield Taylor consented to be an advisory committee the editorial staff was complete  Those first weeks were a continual excitement The first episode was the pronunciamento of a Boston rival which threatening to absorb our title and to begin a month ahead of us forced us to advance our first number to October Appearing about September twenty third it antedated the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Poetry Journal by nearly two months and made our long announced title secure  Soon Mr Pound sent over some more imagist poems by Richard Aldington and H D and that first group from the Gitanjali which made POETRY the first publisher in English of Rabindranath Tagore Hard upon their appearance in the December number came a letter from the great Bengali poet s son postmarked Urbana Illinois and soon the poet himself whom we had thought of as in India became a familiar and friendly presence in Chicago  So it went on that first winter William Butler Yeats lent the splendor of his name to our third number and among the other early arrivals were Joseph Campbell and Ernest Rhys from over seas and many Americans Agnes Lee Mrs Conkling Witter Bynner John Reed Mr Torrence Mr Sterling Miss Widdemer appearing among the thirty five poets of our first volume our first half year  Each successive volume brought its special excitement Ezra Pound with Contemporania and Allen Upward with his Chinese Scented Leaves were the most thrilling episodes of the second Carl Sandburg and D H Lawrence of the third Amy Lowell of the fourth the War Number and Edgar Lee Masters and Miss Skinner of the fifth and so on this must not become a chronicle There has never been any reason to doubt the response of the poets with few exceptions they have stood by us loyally even through differences of opinion and the friendships thus begun have been the editor s chief reward   These Five Years  It has been not without misgivings and tremors that we have faced the alternative of bringing POETRY to an end or soliciting a new guaranty fund Who were we that we should ask a subsidy in these costly days of war But a wave from the deeps rose to sweep away our doubts All the more because of war must our fellow countrymen cherish the arts and especially this art of the poets who have been from the dawn of time the annunciators of truth the first revealers of beauty W e can not afford to close our doors to them who knows what spirit of fire might knock in vain POETRY may not be a grand enough portal and the lamps that light it may burn dim in drifting winds but until a nobler one is built it should stand and its little lights should show the way as they can H M  REVIEWS  HODGSON S POEMS  Poems by Ralph Hodgson Macmillan Co  There is a certain picture book quality about the poems of Ralph Hodgson One has the feeling that they were meant to go with illustrations Eve for instance seems to call for one of those rather mild drawings of the eternal maid such as one finds in Life I don t know who makes these illustrations no doubt pleasing to clergymen and children but apparently each generation supplies its quota and the ranks are never empty  Eve with her basket was Deep in the bells and grass   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Wading in bells and grass Up to her knees Picking a dish of sweet Berries and plums to eat Down in the bells and grass Under the trees  Even that much praised poem The Bull seems to have  been destined for pictorial accompaniment It is in itself  pictorial not imagistic two very distinct things  See an old unhappy bull Sick in soul and body both Slouching in the undergrowth Of the forest beautiful Banished from the herd he led Bulls and cows a thousand head  This poem gives the impression of a literary performance  surprisingly well brought off if has the accent of literary  success But whenever I read it I am somehow reminded  of an amusing parallel in the cowboy song of The Last  Longhorn  An ancient long horned bovine Lay dying by the river There was lack of vegetation And the cold winds made him shiver A cowboy sat beside him With sadness in his face To see his final passing This last of a noble race  The ancient eunuch struggled  And raised his shaking head  Saying I care not to linger  When all my friends are dead  These Jerseys and these Holsteins  They are no friends of mine  They belong to the nobility  Who live across the brine   Hodgson s Poems  Perhaps this has no literary quality Certainly Mr Hodgson s poem has no lack of it The Bull is picturesquely decorative with an element of the bizarre a suspicion of the studied properties of modern art or stage decoration  And things abominable sit Picking offal buck or swine On the mess and over it Burnished flies and beetles shine And spiders big as bladders lie Under hemlocks ten foot high  And a dotted serpent curled Round and round and round a tree Yellowing its greenery Keeps a watch on all the world All the world and this old bull In the forest beautiful  From this the style descends quite obviously to that of the nursery picture book And his little frame grew stout And his little legs grew strong And the way was not so long And his little horns came out And he played at butting trees And boulder stones and tortoises   Some of Mr Hodgson s shorter poems have the charm of a thing that seems to occur with the ease and carelessness of a wayside flower If in some of these one may detect the accent of William Blake it does not greatly matter since they have also a life of their own What does matter is that except in these Mr Hodgson seems to give us so little that is himself that so good a craftsman as he is said to be should awaken in us no more than a passing admiration of his skill of craft of a facility which has no indication of basic growth   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He is at his best in the very short poems such as The Mystery Stupidity Street The Bells of Heaven or Reason Has Moons and in the shorter ballads which are simply ballads such as Time You Old Gipsy Man or The Gipsy Girl His most marked characteristic is a sense of the crime against the freedom of all living things one might speak of it as a social sense but it is more individualistic more concrete than that As an instance of the influence of contemporary poets one upon the other it may be remarked that had The House Across the Way been included in Walter de la Mare s collection of poems one would never have suspected that it was not his It has precisely that atmosphere of suggested mystery noted as essentially characteristic of Mr de la Mare s work And is there not also in Mr de la Mare s work something of that picture book quality which one finds in Mr Hodgson s A C H  FOUR YOUNG POETS  Asphalt by Orrick Johns Alfred A Knopf  Of a beauty exquisite and rare are some of the poems in this book I speak less of those smelling of Bowery asphalt which open the volume than of certain Country Rhymes poems of Old Youth and lyrics of love and death  We all remember how Mr Johns leaped into fame by winning the first prize in the Lyric Year contest of five years ago The prize poem Second Avenue is however one of the least interesting entries in the book in spite of a few fine lines We may imagine with what a wry face   Four Young Poets  the author reprinted it now that he has outgrown its preachy tone Probably it was Ezra Pound s taut style that gave Mr Johns his first jolt out of the Gray s Elegy attitude at any rate the Songs of Deliverance which POETRY printed in February 1914 were the first evidence of the change The very spirit of arrogant and rebellious youth is in that poem for me perhaps the poet omitted it from his first book because he has become more reconciled to everyday life or maybe he thought its manner too Ezra Poundish Anyway he struck for freedom with it and since then he has been himself  Most of the poems in this book are in rhyme Those in Bowery dialect grouped as Asphalt have a bitter tang but they strike me as made one feels the tools they are not quite spontaneous Perhaps the last one Hunger is the best with this for a refrain  Hunger is it hunger  It s hunger widout end  It s hunger fer a decent word  An hunger fer a friend  It s hunger fer a gal ya like  Er hunger fer yer bread  Gawd o mighty help yer bo  It s hunger till yer dead  In the songs done in his own language Mr Johns lyric  passion has a freer range He finds the beauty of life in  common little things and his ribald wit delights in taking  a wicked nip out of human pride Indeed he has a profound  a somewhat Rabelaisian sense of humor he discerns the  grotesqueness of life queer dust whorls creeping over a   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  whirling planet and for him human beings have little higher claim to dignity than their kin the beasts Thus there is no nature faking in his delight in animals and other out door lives Every dog he phrases is absolutely and indestructibly an individual dog not sentimentalized or humanized and the tree or the tree toad under it live by their own right without permission of man  The old gray cocks Are prouder than a king And even when they scratch It s a dignified thing I wish there were space to quote a number of poems in order to show with what a light touch this poet expresses the very sharpest edge of feeling If man is a grotesque a weird experiment then his poignant sorrow his exquisite joy are the final proof that something beautiful has been achieved that a new glaze of rare and unforeseen color has come out of the fire Mr Johns makes us feel this ineffable beauty in E Poi Vidi Venir da Lungi Amore which is a woman s perfumed breath of sighs for love s fragmentariness in The Coronal of Dust and other sorigs for the dead in The Door with its sense of life s fragility and wonder and in the wounding sharpness of this perfect lyric The Answer  Crying cranes and wheeling crows I ll remember them she said And I will be your own God knows And the sin be on my head  I will be your own and glad Lovers would be fools to care How a thing is good or bad When the sky is everywhere   Four Young Poets  I will be your own she said Because your voice is like the rain And your kiss is wine and bread Better than my father s grain  So I took her where she spoke Breasts of snow and burning mouth Crying cranes and drifting smoke And the blackbirds wheeling south  H M Streets and Faces by Scudder Middleton The Little Book Publisher Arlington N J  It is not often that a first book of verse creates an impression of selection and reserve as definite as that occasioned by this small volume To be true not all tire poems achieve the same level of excellence Mr Middleton s style is in process of formation it is not the developed style of an older man but it has indications of individuality When I say this I am thinking of the poems that are most individual  Arophe The Stranger The Heavenly Intrigue Interlude  and others not of those poems which may be said to belong to a class that of the subject poem so dearly loved by the magazines Mr Middleton has done very well with these has lifted them above the ruck still poems like The Wax Museum for Men or The Waiting Woman do definitely belong to this class and it is a genre hard to reconcile with poetry I should like to see the poet discard it  Mr Middleton has absorbed of the new movement some of its best qualities instead of its worst as so many others have done His free verse is by no means loose and it does not record an observation of life purely stenographic To An Old Couple is one of the best in this form  v   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The years unravel the designs of youth  Yet time brings at the last  The serene illusion of accomplishment  When your two wrinkled hands meet in the night  You know that all is well  It is this subtle perception of experience that gives life to this poet s work One finds it in The Clerk where the released worker can still do nothing but go on counting up figures in Heaven and one finds it in an unusual degree in that truly remarkable little poem called Children This is by all means the finest poem in the book Not that it has the perfection of Keats odes or Shelley s songs it may not have the rounded final perfection of art but it has the frailty of earth passion about it and it is very delicately expressed A C H  Swords for Life by Irene Rutherford McLeod B W  Huebsch  This second book by the young author of Songs to Save a  Soul strengthens the first impression that she is a poet of unusual promise In both little volumes are strains of the lyric cry of youth fainter perhaps in the second than the first but in both authentic the cry of a free spirit full of love and fire  She should beware of certain temptations however On the accommodating slip cover the London Times calls this book an advance over the other because there is less in it of the mere recording of moods there is now conviction and purpose behind most of the poems Of some of them that is unfortunately true the first one for example with its   Four Young Poets  Yours not to falter and shrink Yours not to shelter away 1 which almost persuades one to read no more A girl poet of twenty or less is entitled to moods but conviction and purpose are dangerous things in her inexperienced hands They lead her to exclamatory advice preaching and other banalities Spring and a Larch Wood has in it the joy of discovering beauty in the wood  I dared not breathe nor look nor stir I was so hushed in holiness I was so strangely close to her I dared not move to touch her dress I w a so bound in quietness The hoyden wind abashed like me And sunk in piteous surprise Crept to her very wistfully Kissing her golden lidded eyes With little mournful gusty sighs  The brief lyrics in this book are not quite so good as two or three in the earlier volume but this part of Love s Guard is very delicate  When first I awake Half seeing half dreaming Morning shadows take Shape and life seeming  A little sweet ghost Calls me enchants me He and his bright host Of memories haunts me  His hand seeks my face Like little leaves falling There is no quiet place Where he is not calling   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  It is not well with thee O my darling It is not well with thee My little darling  H M  The Dance of Youth by Julia Cooley Sherman French  amp Co  One is softly moved by this book because of its girlishness It is so solemn so thoughtful so burdened with knowledge and experience and yet withal so young and ignorant We have the typical educated American girl talented moreover in this case who has been typically protected and withdrawn and who is piteouslv fumbling for life and art through the fuzzy cottonwool of conventionalities She has in her the makings of both woman and poet but one feels the blur of self consciousness getting in the way of both She would give herself away as woman and poet must but unconsciously and in spite of herself a thousand tendencies of her blood and breeding all the nice girl niceties that tend to make a perfect lady of her get in the way of the gift and she can t break through Not yet at least Life may break a way for her of course if it dashes her on the rocks and tears her to pieces But the trouble is in many of these cases life also acts like a lady and holds aloof Life seems daunted by the smooth undaunted front these girls put up it would be too cruel a task to break them on the wheel even though they say  Smite Life that I may know you well The makings of a poet yes but most of this first book should go into the discard When the poet is made if that   Four Young Poets  day comes she will find the proudest efforts of her maiden volume stiff and formal and painstaking and will bless the muses that a few escape this blight Th e title poem escapes it by a hair s breadth a happy miracle because the poem has a delicate tune of its own Here is a third of it  Lai s and Thai s have gone from the noon And Berenice bloomed of yore Lesbia whitens beneath the moon And Sappho sings no more A shadow lurks in the Milky Way And behind the moon is Death Dance oh dance till the night is gray And the dew is a shuddering breath Ye are Lai s and Thai s now Ye are the fruit of the hour Sway we and sing like a summer bough Till another youth shall flower In Spring Sorrow is another soft fine tune and a few brief and simple poems show a delicate touch Sh e Bends above a Flower TSlagic Moonlight Success Futility And there is a bit of cosmic irony in The Anthem H M  A POET S UPBRINGING  Reveries Over Childhood and Youth by William Butler Yeats Macmillan Co Soberly and lucidly Mr Yeats sets down in these pages  his reveries ending at the threshold of his creative period Then there is a postscript wherein the poet says For some months now I have lived with my youth and childhood not always writing indeed but thinking of it almost every day and I am sorrowful and disturbed It is not that I have accom   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  pushed too few of my plans for I am not ambitious but when I think of all the books I ve read and of all the wise wordshave heard spoken and of the anxiety I have given to parents and grandparents and of the hopes I have had all life weighed in the scales of my own life seems to me to be a preparation for something that never happens  And so the reveries end in the gray mood One might read them and not be aware that they were about a great creative artist Indeed if the names had been suppressed one would say that a cultivated man who had met many cultivated people and who had formed some challenging judgments was the subject of the memoir I saw God with his face pressed against the window says William Blake that was when I was about six years of age Mr Yeats tells us nothing of his majestic visitants though surely an archangel must have looked through his windows  How he rose to the poet within him and how he made himself a national poet these are what we look to the memoir to reveal but the author has not chosen to let us feel the throb of such great experiences  Mr Yeats had a fair place for his early upbringing a beautiful county in the west of Ireland His grandfather was a stormy old man who had been the captain and owner of a merchant ship He was fortunate in his father John B Yeats the painter who has one of the most disinterested minds of his day For him freedom in life and creation in art are all in all A comrade to his son he taught him to dislike all that was abstract and merely reflective in art  The poet joined one of the patriotic literary societies in Ireland Once reading aloud some poem to their company   A Poet s Upbringing  he discovered that although it was written in vague abstract words such as one finds in a newspaper it had power to move them to tears It was a poem describing the shore of Ireland as seen by a returning emigrant He thought that the poem moved them because it contained the actual thought of a man at a passionate moment of life and so he became interested in the thought of a poetry that would be a personal utterance  It was his friendship with the Irish political leader John O Leary that made him resolve to be one of the creators of a national literature for Ireland He thought that the Irish and the Anglo Irish might be brought together if the country had a national literature that would make Ireland beautiful in memory and yet be freed from provincialism by an exacting criticism He tells us of the difficulties and discouragements that grew up as he went on with his task He seems to be unaware that his idea and his work have now a unique flowering  Besides his father and his grandfather the two figures that are most notably shown are the Fenian leader John O Leary and the courtly scholar Edward Dowden O Leary whom the poet celebrated afterwards in a ballad and for a contrast Professor Dowden with his dark romantic face and his ironic manner Dowden who might have been a poet if he had once yielded himself to life but who became a critic instead John B Yeats said of him Talking to Dowden is like talking to a priest one must be careful not to remind him of his sacrifice The famous scholar was helpful to   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the young poet but it was Dowden s poems that made him consider the whole question of lyric poetry He says  I was about to learn that if a man is to write lyric poetry he must be shaped by nature and art to one of the half a dozen traditional poses and be lover or saint sage or sensualist or mere mocker of all life and that none but that stroke of luckless luck can open before him the accumulated expression of the world  P C  CORRESPONDENCE  A NOTE FROM MR LINDSAY  The following letter may assist the reader s understanding of our two poems by its author  Dear POETRY The Soap box is ray only poem in this manner except The Kallyope Yell written five years ago From the words Free speech to the end it is to be given like that poem in college yell fashion but more musically with the rasp of the college yell left out and its energy retained  As for Samson I attended a negro church with John Carpenter when I was last in Chicago and some of the spirit of the sermùns we heard went into Samson and the process of conversion and repentance is I hope an honest and reverent record of what happened before us There was not any rolling on the ground but one woman was carried out in a cataleptic state  After coming home I heard a negro sermon on Jerusalem whose refrain every few minutes was Let Jerusalem be coming into your mind Another day I heard amid a general exhortation this outburst There was a Russian revolution yesterday and my Lord is riding high  I have used these phrases I hope in the same spirit that they were originally uttered The fundamental difficulty of negro sermon poems of this type is that there is a profound seriousness of passion in the midst of things at which the outsider is fairly entitled to smile and when a white man tries to render this seriousness and this humor at the same time he is apt to be considered more of a humorist than a sermonizer The negroes are perfectly willing to laugh a little on the way up to glory and unlike the white man they do   A Note from Mr Lindsay  not have to stop going up while they laugh I should say that one tenth of Samson has a humorous intention but I will venture that the average reader will consider it nine tenths humorous through lack of familiarity with that amazing figure the negro preacher who is just as unique and readily at hand now as he was twenty five years ago when he was much more discussed and parodied  Vachel Lindsay  THE POETRY THEATRE LEAGUE  The following letter sets forth a new project which should interest all lovers of poetry To the modern reader this art is too much an affair of the library he needs to be reminded that it began as an art of song and speech Mr Brody and his associates are trying to win back for poetry its place among the articulate arts  Dear POETRY The Poetry Theatre League 287 Fifth Avenue New York means to participate in every way possible with the renaissance now taking place in poetry but its particular object is to establish a center for the public recitation of poetry Just as Music is interpreted by artist players just as Drama is interpreted by actors and stage directors so Poetry is to be staged with costumes scenic effects or music and interpreted by artist reciters In this way by appealing to all the senses we hope to reach an audience outside of and larger than the poetry reading public and thus extend the appreciation of poetry Miss Hedwig Reicher our Artistic Director and an actress of international reputation has been experimenting in productions of this kind and has demonstrated their aesthetic value and feasibility beyond a doubt  In addition the activities of The Poetry Theatre League will include the production of poetic plays the arrangement of lectures on poetry and readings by poets of their own works In this latter way we hope to be instrumental in presenting poets whom publishers are too timid to introduce to the public We will also encourage and endeavor to organize poetry societies in universities and settlements and supply them with programs and lecturers  The profits of the League will be devoted exclusively to prizes for the best poems appearing in American magazines and for the best poetic plays submitted to us Alter Brody   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THAT COWBOY POEM  Editor of POETRY I was greatly interested in High Chin  Bob published in the August POETRY  The original poem is entitled The Glory Trail the author  is Charles Badger Clark Jr it was first published in the  Pacific Monthly April 1911 I enclose a copy  Seattle Wash William H Skaling  EDITOR S NOTE On the whole the cowboy version simplifies and improves Mr Clark s poem in our opinion although by a curious process of elimination the revisers unconsciously deprived each double stanza except the last of an entire rhythmic phrase an entire line according to the author s way of printing the poem in short lines instead of long The first stanza from the Pacific Monthly will serve by comparison with our August number to show how far the cowboy s idea of a folk poem differed from the author s  Way high up the Mogollons Among the mountain tops A lion cleaned a yearlin s bones And licked his thankful chops When on the picture who should ride A trippin down a slope But High Chin Bob with sinful pride And mav rick hungry rope  Oh glory be to me says he And fame s unfadin flowers All meddlin hands are far away I ride my good top hawse today And I m top rope of Lazy J Hi kitty cat you re ours  GOOD BYE TO EUNICE TIETJENS  The poem printed below may serve to

order to go to France as a  correspondent of the Chicago Daily News In saying a  regretful farewell to Mrs Tietjens we may hope that she  will become also a correspondent of POETRY Her intimate  knowledge of both French and German and her wide ac  quaintance among poets may enable her to inform us now  and then about conditions in the art abroad especially in  Paris But here is the poem  PROFILES FROM CHINA  This is a book fresh from the printing press and bindery Some of the red of a woman s heart is between its covers and it is a strong and honest book I listen between the covers and I hear the beggars fakirs scholars ricksha runners rice farmers and street dogs of swarming immitigable irrepressible stinking going somewhere China  It is a simple book filled with the subtleties and drolleries of simple people and I know boys in short pants who could read and fathom most of it  The portent of it is like the laughter of a nut between two stones occasionally it ejects the sneeze of a shriveled panhandler lacking an overcoat in rate November and the meaning of it will be nil to those who never enjoy the whiff of humanity in the mob  They wish for a laquer work synthesis of the motives of a workingman s wife who has paid ten coppers for a new kitchen god and they protest the absence of spectric hues in the picture of a beggar picking lice off his shirt  It is the same as looking at a wounded soldier and saying This red blood is quite red while this other red blood is not quite so red  Carl Sandburg  NOTES  The readers of POETRY need little information about most of
