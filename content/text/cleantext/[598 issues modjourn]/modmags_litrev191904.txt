AndersonTHE LITTLE REVIEW VolVAPRIL 1919 No11PROLOGUE William Carlos Williams The Return of the Sun Her voice was like rose fragrance waltzing in the windShe seemed a shadowstained with shadow colorsSwimming through waves of sunlightThe sole precedent I can find for the broken style of my prologue is Longinus on the Sublimeand that one far fetchedWhen my mother was in Rome on that rare journey forever to be rememberedshe lived in a small pension near the Pincio gardensThe place had been chosen by my brother as one notably easy of accessbeing in a quarter free from confusion of trafficon a street close to the parkand furthermore the tram to the American Academy passed at the cornerYet never did my mother go out but she was in fear of being lostBy turning to the left when she should have turned rightactually she did once manage to go so far astray that it was nearly an hour before she extricated herself from the strangeness of every new vista and found a landmarkThere has always been a disreputable man of picturesque personality associated with this ladyTheir relations have been marked by the most rollicking spirit of comradeshipNow it has been Williamformer sailor in Admiral Dewey s fleet at Manilathen Tom O Rourck who has come to her to do odd jobs and to be cared for more or less when drunk or illtheir PenelopeWilliam would fall from the grape arbor much to my mother s amusement and delightand to his blustering discomfitureor he would stagger to the back door nearly unconscious from bad whiskeyThere she would serve him with very hot and very strong coffeethen put him to scrubbing the kitchen floorpouring into his suddy pail half a bottle of ammonia which would make the man gasp and water at the eyes as he worked and became soberShe has always been incapable of learning from benefit or disasterIf a man cheat her she will remember that man with a violence that I have seldom seen equaledbut so far as that could have an influence on her judgment of the next man or woman she might be living in an EdenAnd indeed she isan improverishedravished Eden but one indestructible as the imagination itselfWhatever is before her is sufficient to itself and so to be valuedHer meat though more delicate in fiber is of a kind with that of Villon and La Grosse MargotVentegreslegellej ai mon pain cuitCarl Sandburg sings a negro cotton picker s song

That ll be ma HOMEThat ll be ma HOOME My mother is given over to frequent periods of great depressionbeing as I believe by nature the most light hearted thing in the world But there comes a grotesque turn to her talka macabre anecdote concerning some dreama passionate statement about deathwhich elevates her mood without marring itsometimes in a I most startling wayLooking out at our parlor window one day I said to her We see all the shows from heredon t weall the weddings and funeralsThey had been preparing a funeral across the streetthe undertaker was just putting on his overcoat She replied Funny profession thatburying the dead peopleI should think they wouldn t have any delusions of life left WOh yesit s merely a professionMHrnAnd how they study itThey say sometimes people look terrible and they come and make them look fineThey push things into their mouths Realistic gesture WMamaMYeswhen they haven t any teethBy some such dark turn at the end she raises her story out of the commonplaceLook at that chairlook at it The plasterers had just left If MrsJ or MrsD saw that they would have a fitWCall them inmaybe it will kill themMBut they re not near as bad as that womanyou knowher husband was in the chorushas a daughter HelenMrsByesShe once wanted to take rooms hereI didn t want herThey told me MrsWilliamsI heard you re going to have MrsBShe is particularShe said so herselfOh noOnce she burnt all her face painting under the sink Thus seeing the thing itself without forethought or afterthought but with great intensity of perception my mother loses her bearings or associates with some disreputable person or translates a dark moodShe is a creature of great imaginationI might say this is her sole remaining qualityShe is a despoiledmoulted castaway but by this power she still breaks life between her fingersOnce when I was lunching with Walter Arensberg at a small place on 63rd Street I asked him if he could state what the more modern painters were aboutthose roughly classed at that time ascubists GleiszeMan RayDemuthDu Champs all of whom were then in the cityHe replied by saying that the only way man differed from every other creature was in his ability to improvise novelty andsince the pictorial artist was under discussionanything in paint that is truly newtruly fresh creationis good artThus according to Du Champswho was Arensberg s champion at the timea stained glass window that had fallen out and lay more or less together on the ground was of far greater interest than the thing conventionally composed in situWe returned to Arensberg s sumptuous studio where he gave further point to his remarks by showing me what appeared to foe the original of Du Champs famous Nude Descending a StaircaseBut thishe went on to sayis a full sized photographic print of the first picture with many new touches by Du Champs himself and so by the technique of its manufacture as by other means it is a noveltyLed on by these enthusiasms Arensberg has been an indefatigable worker for the yearly salon of the Society of Independent ArtistsIncI remember the warmth of his description of a pilgrimage to the home of that old Boston hermit whowatched over by a forbidding landladyevidently in his pay paints the cigar box cover like nudes upon whose fingers he presses actual rings with glass jewels from the five and ten cent storeI wish Arensberg had my opportunity for prying into jaded households where the paintings of Mama s and Papa s flowertime still hang on the wallsI purpose that Arensberg be commissioned by the Independent Artists to scour the country for the abortive paintings of those men and women whowithout master or methodhave evolved perhaps two or three unusual creations in their early yearsI would start the collection with a painting I have by a little English womanAEKerr1906that in its unearthly gaiety of flowers and sobriety of design possesses exactly that strange freshness a spring day approaches without attainingan expansion of Aprila thing this poor woman found too costly for her possession she could not swallow it as the niggers do diamonds in the minesCarefully selected these queer products might be housed to good effect in some unpretentious exhibition chamber across the city from the Metropolitan Museum of ArtIn the anteroom could be hung perhaps photographs of prehistoric rock paintings and etchings on horngalloping bisons and stagsthe hind feet of which have been caught by the artist in such a position that from that time until the invention of the camera obscuraa matter of 6000 years or moreno one on earth had again depicted that most delicate and expressive posture of runningThe amusing controversy between Arensberg and Du Champs on one sideand the rest of the hanging committee on the other as to whether the porcelain urinal was to be admitted to the Palace Exhibition of 1917 as a representative piece of American sculpture should not be allowed to slide into oblivionOne day Du Champ decided that his composition for that day would be the first thing that struck his eye in the first hardware store he should enterIt turned out to be a pickaxe which he bought and set up in his studioThis was his compositionTogether with Mina Loy and a few others Du Champs and Arensberg brought out the paper The Blind Man to which Robert Carlton Brownwith his vision of suicide by diving from a high window of the Singer Buildingcontributed a few poemsIn contradistinction to their southMarianne Moore s statement to me at the Chatham parsonage one afternoon my wife

fearedBy divergent virtues these two women have achieved freshness of presentationnoveltyfreedombreak with banality When Margaret Anderson published my first Improvisations Ezra Pound wrote me one of his hurried letters in which he urged me to give some hint by which the reader of good will might come at my intentionBefore Ezra s permanent residence in Londonon one of his trips to America brought on I think by an attack of jaundice he was glancing through some book of my father s It is not necessary he said to read everything in a book in order to speak intelligently of itDon t tell everybody I said so he addedDuring this same visit my father and he had been reading and discussing poetry togetherPound has always liked my father I of course like your Old Man and I have drunk his GoldwasserThey were hot for an argument that dayMy parent had been holding forth in downright sentences upon my ownidle nonsensewhen he turned and became equally vehement concerning something Ezra had writtenwhat in heaven s name Ezra meant byjewelsin a verse that had come between themThese jewelsrubiessapphiresamethysts and what notPound went on to explain with great determination and carewere the

of the Greeks as setting out for the colonies in Sicily and the Italian PeninsulaThe Greek temperament lent itself to a certain symmetrical sculptural phase and to a fat poetical balance of line that

remained hot longerHellenismespecially the modern sortis too staidtoo chillytoo little fecunda tive to impregnate my worldHilda Doolittle before she began to write poetry or at least before she began to show it to anyone would say You re not satisfied with meare you BillyThere s something lackingisn t there When I was with her my feet always seemed to be sticking to the ground while she would be walking on the tips of the grass stemsTen years later as assistant editor of the Egoist she refers to my long poem March whichthanks to her own and her husband s friendly attentionsfinally appeared there in a purified form14 Aug1916 Dear Bill I trust you will not hate me for wanting to delete from your poem all the flippanciesThe reason I want to do this is that the beautiful lines are so very beautiful so in the tone and spirit of your Postude which to me standsa Nikesupreme among your poems I think there is real beauty and real beauty is a rare and sacred thing in this generation in all the pyramidAshur ban i pal bits and in the Fiesole and in the wind at the very lastI don t know what you thinkbut I consider this business of writing a very sacred thingI think you have thespark am sure of itand when you speak direct are a poetI feel in the hey ding ding touch running through your poem a derivitive tendency whichto meis not you not your very selfIt is as if you were ashamed of your Spiritashamed of your inspirationas if you mocked at your own songIt s very well to mock at yourself it is a spiritual sin to mock at your inspiration Hilda Oh wellall this might be very disquieting were it not thatsacredhas lately teen discovered to apply to a point of arrest where stabilization has gone on past the timeThere is nothing sacred about literatureit is damned from one end to the otherThere is nothing in literature but change and change is mockeryI ll write whatever I damn pleasewhenever I damn please and as I damn please and it ll be good if the authentic spirit of change is on itBut in any case HDmisses the entire intent of what I am doingno matter how just her remarks concerning that particular poem happen to have beenThe hey ding ding touch was derivi tive but it filled a gap that I did not know how better to fill at the timeIt might be said that that touch is the prototype of the improvisationsIt is to the inventive imagination we look for deliverance from every other misfortune as from the desolation of a flat Hellenic perfection of styleWhat good then to turn to artfrom the atavistic religionistsfrom a science doing slavey service upon gas enginesfrom a philosophy tangled in a miserable sort of dialect that means nothing if the full power of initiative be denied at the beginning by a lot of baying and snapping scholiastsIf the inventive imagination must lookas I thinkto the field of art for its richest discoveries today it will best make its way by compass and follow no pathBut before any material progress can be accomplished there must be someone to draw a discriminating line between true and false valuesThe true value is that peculiarity which gives an object a character by itselfThe associational or sentimental value is the falseIts imposition is due to lack of imaginationto an easy lateral slidingThe attention has been held too rigid on the one plane instead of following a more flexiblejagged resortIt is to loosen the attentionmy attention since I occupy part of the fieldthat I write these improvisationsHere I clash with Wallace StevensThe imagination goes from one thing to anotherGiven many things of nearly totally divergent natures but possessing one thousandth part of a quality in commonprovided that be newdistinguishedthese things belong in an imaginative category and not in a gross natural arrayTo me this is the gist of the whole matterIt is easy tofall under the spell of a certain modeespecially if it be remote of originleaving thus certain of its members essential to a reconstruction of its significance permanently lost in an impenetrable mist of timeBut the thing that stands eternally in the way of really good writing is always onethe virtual impossibility of lifting to the imagination those things which lie under the direct scrutiny of the sensesclose to the noseIt is this difficultythat sets a value upon all works of art and makes them a necessityThe senses witnessing what is immediately before them in detail see a finality Which they cling to in despairnot knowing which way to turnThus the so called natural or scientific array becomes fixedthe walking devil of modern lifeHe who even nicks the solidity of this apparition does a piece of work superior to that of Hercules when he cleaned the Augean stablesStevensletter applies really to my book of poems Al Que Quiere which meansby the wayTo Him Who Wants It but the criticism he makes of that holds good for each of the Improvisations if not for the work as a wholeIt begins with a postscript in the upper left hand corner I thinkafter allI should rather send this than notalthough it is quarrelsomely full of my own ideas of disciplineApril 9 My dear WilliamsWhat strikes me most about the poems themselves is their casual character Personally I have a distaste for miscellanyIt is one of the reasons I do not bother about a book myself Wallace Stevens is a fine gentleman whom Cannell likened to a Pennsylvania Dutchman who has suddenly become aware of his habits and taken tosocietyin self defenseHe is always immaculately dressedI don t know why I should always associate him in my mind with an imaginary image I have of Ford Madox Hueffer My idea is that in order to carry a thing to the extreme necessity to convey it one has to stick to itGiven a fixed point Of viewrealisticimagistic or what you willeverything adjusts itself to that point of viewand the process of adjustment is a world in fluxas it should be for a poetBut to fidget with points of view leads always to new beginnings and incessant new beginnings lead to sterility This sounds like Sir Roger de CoverlyA single manner or mood thoroughly matured and exploited is that fresh thing etcOne has to keep looking for poetry as Renoir looked for colors in old wallsold wood work and so onYour place is among children Leaning around a dead dogA book of that would feed the hungry Well a book of poems is a damned serious affairI am only objecting that a book that contains your particular quality should contain anything else and suggesting that if that quality were carried to a communicable extremein intensity and volumeetc I see it all over the bookin your landscapes and portraitsbut dissipated and obscuredBouquets for brides and Spencerian compliments for poetsThere are a very few men who have anything native in them or for whose work I d give a Bolshevic ruble But I think your tantrums not half mad enough I am not quite clear about the last sentence but I presume he means that I do not pushmy advantage through to an overwhelming decisionWhat would you have me do with my CirceStevensnow that I have double crossed her gamemarry herIt is not what Odysseus did I return Pound s letter observe how in everything he does

spaciousoldold MallThe leaves of the dozens of elms along the promenades were yellow pensivehelpless little things great masses of them transformed into glimmering amber by the yellow light from an orb of boiling gold in the westthe glare from which orb streamed through and beneath the branches and across the lawns of the Mall to the windows of the time somber mansions on the farther sidethere pausing to look back upon its pastEach window sent back a flood of boiling goldwestwardtoward the sourceThe grayGothic church on the campus risebehind its yellow elmsreminded me of an aged grande dame peering out from her golden galoonEven the trunks of the elmsfar and nearcaught the metallic luster and the lawns so spread with poor little yellow leaves were of golden plushThe airthough nervouswas

memory of your kisses was like a flight of water fowlThe memory of your words was like a meadow in late SeptemberThe memory of your deeds was like a path that is overgrownI do not wonder why you

earth from your feet The earth that gnaws at you Until your wing cries strike the autumn nightYou seewith methis running cloud Balancing a crescent moon Upon his tawny finger tipThe touch of your desireor its fallWould but be symbols of an equal deathDOG EAT DOG Ben Hecht WE were in a fine philosophical moodmy friend and Iand we walked in the avenue with portentous and sardonic stepsHe with his shoulders lifted and his apeish head wagging slowly from side to sideI with the proper Mona Lisa crook to my lipsThus men walk whenas inviolable godsthey debate the puerilities and ironies of lifeThere was about us in this avenue the paganism of women s buttocks moving under adroit silksof round warm legs flashing their curves and luscious tints in the sunof pear moulded breasts dancing beneath tight fabrics Bodies moving slowly toward some fantastic carnivalthey seemedfaces rouged and stencilled for subtle and priapic ritesContinuously they zig zagged by uscolored like totemsa shining barbaric procession of lusts in caricatureThe marvel of it was that some hallooing buck did not come bounding into this avenue and seize upon these legs and buttocks and breasts that promenaded in such elaborate and piquant masqueradeA thought worthy of philosophersHere under the tall sunny buildings with their polished windowshere walled by the luxurious dignity of their great rectangular faceswhat a saturnalian rape were possibleWhat a dancing and a shouting and a rolling about with the Tom Tom of the traffic hammering out its quickdelirious monotoneWhat a wild racing up and down silk strewn pavementsin and out of marble corridored grottosWhat an insane and whimsical burlesque of passionAlas these were merely the unwindings of philosophical fancyBefore us remained the vista of bobbing faces and hidden undulated bodies wedded to exotic plumage and lushent fabricsFrom these corseted nymphs as they passed issued trailing perfumes that fell upon the nose as the cunning intimate whispers of a panderer might come into the earToward some fantastic carnival they might be destinedthere are still boudoirs in the worldit is said but their faces remained as they floated by a succession of stencilled and unchanging blanksThey stared now into the beaming windows of the avenue shopsHerein behind sun streaked panels of glass lay oriental silksgold and green and turquoiseJapanese bric a braclittle monsters of bronzeblack and vermillion screensscrolled porcelainsHere also they saw as they passed leather elegancieslittle black velvet boxes of jewelsmoon white silversplatters of goldand occasionally groups of waxen manikins garlanded with shining fabrics and postured in simpering mannerismsTired of these windows they glanced now at each other or looked up in unimaginable conversations at the grey facedcarefully mustached creatures who walked at their sideDelusions all of themBodies of men bathed and shaved and tailored into puppets of commerceWhite bodies of women reduced to piquant stuffing for silksWe walkedmy friend and Iwith sardonic and portentious steps as befit the stride of gods who dot the unending processions of the little greedy half deadTo our left the rubber tired traffic purred and beat out its monotonethe whirling white and black of spokes pirouetted in the sunTo our right the grave and elegant geometries swooped into spaceAnd having walked a goodly way between these things we paused and my friend improved the occasion with a snortHis headas he stood contemplating the varicolored swarm of motionbegan to wag with more deliberationhis face growing pregnant with wordsBy these animated preliminary silences did my friend attune the spirit of his listener for matters of vast and symbolic importThe darkness of his face grew and he raised his arm with a slow gesture and pointed his thumb over his shoulder toward the west I keep thinking he said I keep thinking of the gangs on the west sideThe working peopleThe immemorial masses The ominous drawl of his words and the manner of his facea fixed and flintlike convulsionweighted this thing my friend said with the illusion of depth and sagacity which attended the most trivial of his commentsHis voice continueda voice which had about it the quality of a banjo played with bewildering slowness The immemorial masses on the west side he said who live in stinking houses and sweat ten hours a day for the right to remain aliveThey re coming in this streetThis crowd in silk can t hold them back much longerLook at them He stared into the faces Four civilizations have died he resumed four civilizations have died because the gang on the west side never broke throughBut they re coming through this timeWhen I see all thisall thishe made a slow contemptuous gesture toward the vari colored swarm about us I know the stage is set for the great actWhen I look at the grey and painted faces and these unharnessed useless bodiesI get the breath of the gangs on the west side pushing through My friend paused and eyed the procession in the avenue with a dark and curious amusementFor there was a strange hate in the cerebrations of my friendand a stranger loveHe moved through the day like some grim and ominous evangel and his chuckles invariably reminded me of guillotinesHe had the eyes of a prophetdeep set smoky eyesfastened always upon distancesand his thought was like a slow fume that darkened the air about himThat afternoon as he stood facing the polite and repressed bacchanal of the avenue was the last I saw of himAnd therefore I have told of itHe had consented to walk with me away from the grimy factory strewn scenes Where he was then leading a strike of garment workers The immemorial masses he chuckled and his eyes rested darkly on the dapper procession This crowdthis little string of marionettescan t cheat them much longer His fingers rivited my elbow I get the breath of them he said I get the breath of the gangs on the west side of the world pushing through into the sun We shook hands and the storm of his thoughts remained like an uncanny shadow about me as he passed out of the avenueDuring the days which followed my friend s name appeared often in the newspapersAbout him had rallied some five thousand workers raising a great cry for wages and leisureOnce I went to the west side to see him but found in his place a woman who spoke of him with eagernessShe was a dark eyed creature with a smoulder in her voiceWalking with the rouged and dapper procession in the sunny avenue she would have seemed a strayed and bewildered animalHere amid the sagging housesthe debris covered streetthe broken wallsher spirit was a luminous thingher body arose from the earth with the bend of a far flung defiance to her headIn her eyesas in the eyes of my friendthere were also dark propheciesAnd her words had about them the same stillnessthe same curious air of consecrationShe spoke of many thingsof my friendof povertyof hovels in which men and women decayedand of a mysterious dawn that was to break like a song through the dark places of the worldWhen she spoke of my friend there came into her voice an intimacy and an aweHer body straightened as in some curious saluteHer eyes largened and there was tumult to herHer soul seemed to precipitate itself into embraces unseenMore than ever she would have appeared a strayed and bewildered animal in the dapper procession of the sunny avenueAs her talk moved to topics beyond my friend her intensity changed and her words became more deliberateShe emitted them slowly and it was almost the banjo voice of my friend that spoke I had no faith until I met him she said I had no faith in these peopleBut now they re coming throughThe little silk crowd can t cheat us much longerWe re coming through this timeThe feet of armies have walked over us and we sleptAnd the little silk crowd has taken our blood and we sleptFour civilizations have died because we sleptThis sleep was because without faith we were without soulsBut now we have faith in each otherThe working people are standing togetherFrom one end of the world to the other we have the faith that is bringing us to our feet in one mighty wave In her words was a quality which weighted their awkward rhetoric with a compelling powerThis quality remained with me after I left herFaiththe faith of a woman s eyes raised in the dark of a churchthe faith of a man s eyes resting in awe upon a face finer and slenderer than his ownthe faith of my friend and his friend amid the ancient poverties and decaysthey are not a part of philosophyAnd yet I came away thinking wistfully of the gods that corrupt the reason of the agesIt is after all a lonely and profitless business to deny these godsThe faiths that boil in the souls of the racethe vari shaped altars tended by the little greedy half deadthere is in them perhaps the true solace for those who must find When they seekMy mood of that day on the avenue was goneI walked now in ragged broken streets where the little half dead seem to be moving always in vast and merciless defeatIn these streets I sought the faith of my friendBut the gods as ever eluded meHere was merely a less colored masquerade than in the avenueA great deal of soil and manure is needed to produce a flowereven such a flower as civilizationI watched the strikers gathering and talkingthe men and women passing with intent and burning eyesthe half naked children shrieking over the dirty pavements and I came away with the memory of a purposelessmeaningless fever throbbing in the veins of the dayAnd my friend died in this mannerThe summer sun had loosened the stenches of the alleys when Nolan awokeI have been in Nolan s home and have seen his wife moving about in the morning cooking the breakfast for the seven of themHer body is fat with the humanless contour of a spider and her eyes seem always to be thinking of bruisesFrom morning until night she moves about scrubbingcookingwashingstraighteningfeeding childrenwalking to grocery stores and butcher shopshaggling over penniesThe children scream and brawl and chase each other through lots and alleysJust before noon Nolan sits up in his dark bitter smelling bed and stretches his armsOn the morning of the day in which my friend diedNolan sat up in his bed and stretched his armsAt noon he emerged in his stocking feet and walked about in the kitchen of his homehis suspenders hanging in two purple loops from the waist of his drooping trousersHe was a tall broad shouldered man with a somewhat reddened faceHis face usually vigorous and genial wore a frown whenever he moved about in the small littered rooms of his homeHe ate his breakast in silence and listened to the complaint of his womana complaint whichby reason of its antiquityfell now like meaningless noise on his earsIt was more money for the doctorhis woman neededmore money for the girl who must have another dressmore money for the butcherA depressing racketthis ancient complaint of his womana thing which went on summer and winterNolan ate and the frown of his face grew deeperIn silence he moved into the bitter smelling bedroom and put on his blue uniform and his leather putteesIt was the uniform of the city s mounted policekept by Nolan in some mysterious manner immune from the grime and the squalor of his homeIn this blue transforming uniformfreshly shaved and his neck ornamented with a white band of collarNolan waited patiently for his woman to cease her ancient complaintSixteen years of honest and faithful service were Nolan sand yet the complaint of his woman had grown with each of these yearseven as the smell of his home had thickened and acquired a personality It ll be pay day tomorrow said Nolan at length And what good ll that be said his womanrubbing at her round fat face with her apron Maybe you think you re somebody in them clothes of yoursBut will you look at the bills from the doctor and the butcher And there followed the depressing racket that seemed to Nolan an inevitable companion of the musty bitter smell which stuffed his home It ll be pay day tomorrow said Nolan and he walked out of his homeDown the street he walkedand thought as bitter as the smell of his bed remained in his brainVague thought without outlineit wasHe spat as he walked and cursed under his breathThere was a horse in the police barns that was Nolan sa shining brown upstanding horse that whinnied at him as he came nearIn silence Nolan placed the saddle on his horse and lifted himself into itInto the street he joggedhis broad shouldered figure in its resplendent uniform sitting stiff and careless atop the lively horsehis eyes frowning from under his ornamented capRiding so on his horse Nolan glowered down upon the traffic that grew thicker about himMen jumped out of his way and wagons drew tactfully aside to give him unmolested passageThis sometimes brought cheer into Nolan s heartBut now the sound of his woman s complaint was in his earsand the bitter smell of his home lay like rust in his noseAnd if he was strong and broad and could ride along on his horse nowwhat in h 1 would he be doing to stop the complaint of his woman when he had grown oldNolan came out of the squad room and remountedHe had his orders for the dayHe rode off at a leisurely pace toward the west sideThere was a strike there and trouble and Nolan rode to keep the city from coming to harmThere were a thousand men and women gathered in the streetPolicemen stood before the doors of the blackmany windowed factory building which stretched its flat face down the blockThe crowd in the street shuffled about over the pavements in compact little groupscrying out wordswaving itheir armstheir faces moving in tiny grimacesThey were the strikers that my friend was leadingstunted little men in humorously misfitting clothesgirls in heavy sagging dresses and grimy waistsThey swarmed aboutvoluble and excitedNolan and seven horsemen like himself watched them from the end of the streetThe eight of them sat stiff and straight on their horses and frownedNolan turned abruptly to one of them and said What the h 1they re going to marchThey ain t got a permit for marching They were going to marchThere was a man who stood on a box in the center of the street surrounded by a growing mass of facesHe waved his arms and criedout in a slow far reaching voiceThisman was my friendNolan watched him with the frown deepening in his faceSlowly as my friend cried out the scattered crowd seemed to unravel itself into ranksSymmetrical rows of faces appearedone behind the otherMen began to shout and push other menThere was quickdetermined tumultThe noise then began to die awayIn the silence that came into the street a long thick mass of men and women stood with their eyes raised toward my friend and a curious eager light in their faces They re going to march said Nolan to the horsemen around him and they ain t got a permit He spurred his horse up to my friend who still stood on his box in the center of the street Cut that said Nolan You ain t got a permit to march My friend looked at him and smiledThe ranks of men and women sagged and almost disappearedThe rows of faces became circles and half circlesBut my friend on his little box threw up his arms March he cried out Comradesmark timeWe march to the city hallWe march through th√© avenuesWe will give the little silk crowds a look at us The rattle and thud of feet striking the street soundedThe long thick mass grew mysteriously straightThe rows of faces flashed dully in even lines Into the sun cried my friend Comrades forwardmarch The street movedIt lengthened and swayedThe beat of feet like the long drawn rattle of a drum came into the airSlowlyexpanding and contractingtheir shoulders swayingthe regiment of motionless faces and leaping eyes groped for a rhythmIt came and the regiment marchedDown the street it movedan unwavering indomitable mass of swinging arms and legsAbove the rhythmic lift of its heads appeared banners red and black and inscribed with the words LaborGive Us Bread Nolan and his horsemen watched the swinging column approachFor a moment he stared at it fascinatedThe thought of his woman s complaint had gone from his head and with it the smell that had ridden in his noseUnder his bright blue uniform he felt himself grow warm and curiously aliveThe blood swept through his body and a sweat like that of a strong juice came out of himOaths rushed from his lips and a lust whirled his head Come on he yelled waving his armand his brown upstanding horse leaped forwardMy friend and his immemorial masses were marching and Nolan and his seven horemen were rushing down the street into the face of themAs the horses came nearer my friend grew large in front of the regimentHis voice arose clear and strident above the murmuring behind him and the wild sharp racket of the oncoming horses before him Comrades he shouted marchcomradesHold firmand marchNolanhis eyes swimmingheard the words and tugged at a reign in his handHis brown leaping horse turned lightlyRearing and plunging it shot forward and its iron hoofs cracked down upon the head of the man who had shouted the commandThe thick ranks of the marchers disappeared and became a swarm of circling faces that melted into walls and vanished into little running groupsIn the midst of the streetshouting and plungingreared the seven horsemenThe street grew emptyNolan bounced and cried out in his saddle as his horseturning and prancingleaped again and again upon the figure it had brought downFor a wild thing had burst in Nolan s heart and there was the music of a hammering drum in his earsThere were cries and shrieks about him and he felt a hate leaping in his throatcontracting the muscles of his bodyHis hand fumbling desperately had taken the gun from his pocketHe held it now pointed down at the figure that lay under the dancing feet of his horseBut the figure was silent and motionlessIt lay in a curious disjointed postureits face flattened and crushed into the grime of the streetits body bent and spread out like a wooden thingNolan dismounted and stood with the seven horsemen at the curbThey were all thick shouldered men with strong red facesThey held guns in their handsThey stood with their jaws thrust forward and with glowering eyes stared into the emptied street We got them said Nolan in a thick voice The dirty bumsa pack of god damned sheenies and polacks He glanced toward the figure that lay with its face crushed into the stone in the center of the streetThere were several other figures moving feebly on their belliesAs he looked a woman came rushing toward the disjointed figure of my friendShe hurled herself with a cry across the twisted body and lay there stiff and silentNolan walked toward her his head wagging from side to sideAs he approached she raised her head and flung her fist toward him You killed himYou murdered him she shouted at Nolan But it won t do you any goodYou can t stop usYou can t cheat us much longerDo you hearGod strike you dead youyouHe s deadHe s deadBut you can t keep us backDo you hearWe re coming throughNolan stared at her without wordslooked at the woman s fist that remained shuddering in the airAnd in the voice and gesture of the body there was something that brought back to Nolan s thought the complaint of his womanthe complaint that went on from day to day for sixteen yearsHe darted forward and seized this one by the shoulder Stop your yowling he cried Get upyou bumYou re under arrest He shook her as she followed his grip to her feetThe smell of her brought back into Nolan s nose the smell of his womanHe struck her with his fist Come on he criedhis voice thick with the violence of his blood Get along For a moment Nolan and the woman who had come to my friend remained staring into each other s eyesa hate burning between them and blackening their visionTheir facestwisted and darkcame togetherThere were no wordsWith a great jerk Nolan tumbled the woman along after him toward the curb Come on he growled If you try to break away I ll club you to

back into the house suddenly and slammed the doorYou knew that he disliked the sumach tree and that he was angry with Mark for giving it to MammaWhen you smelt mignonette you thought of Mamma and Mark and the sumach treeand Papa standing on the stepsand the queer laughter that came out of his beardWhen it rained you were naughty and unhappy because you couldn t go out of doorsThen Mamma stood at

something big and solid underneathShe lay quiet and happytrying to guess what it could beand fell asleep againIt was the white lambIt stood on a green standIt smelt of dried hay and gum and paint like the other toy animalsbut its white coat had a dullwoolly smelland that was the real smell of the lambIts largeslanting eyes stared off over its ears into the far corners of the roomso that it never looked at youThis made her feel sometimes that the lamb didn t love herand sometimes that it was frightened and wanted to be comfortedShe trembled when first she stroked it and held it to her faceand sniffed its lamby smellPapa looked down at herHe was smilingand when she looked up at him she was not afraidShe had the same feeling that came sometimes when she sat in Mamma s lap and Mamma talked about God and JesusPapa was sacred and holyHe had given her the lambIt was the end of her birthdayMamma and Jenny were putting her to bedShe felt weak and tiredand sad because it was all over Come to that said Jenny your birthday was over at five minutes past twelve this morningWhen will it come againNot for a whole year said Mamma I wish it would come to morrow Mamma shook her head at her You want to be spoiled and petted every dayNoNoI want I wantShe doesn t know what she wants said Jenny YesI doI doWell I want to love Papa every day Cause he gave me my lambOh said Mamma if you only love people because they give you birthday presentsBut I don t I don t really and trulyYou didn t ought to have no more birthdays said Jenny if they make you cry Why couldn t they see that crying meant that she wanted Papa to be sacred and holy every dayThe day after the birthdaywhen Papa went about the same as everlooking big and frighteningwhen heBaa dinto her face and called outMary had a little lamband MaryMaryquite contraryshe looked after 3 im sorrowfully and thought Papa gave me my lamb IXOne day Uncle Edward and Aunt Bella came over from Chad well GrangeThey were talking to Mamma a long time in the drawing roomand when she came in they stopped and whisperedRoddy told her the secretUncle Edward was going to give her a live lambMark and Dank said it couldn t be trueUncle Edward was not a real unclehe was only Aunt Bella s husbandand he never gave you anythingAnd anyhow the lamb wasn t born yet and couldn t come for weeks and weeksEvery morning she asked Has my new lamb comeWhen is it comingDo you think it will come to day She could keep on sitting still quite a long time by merely thinking about the new lambIt would run beside her when she played in the gardenIt would eat grass out of her handShe would tie a ribbon round its neck and lead it up and down the laneAt these moments she forgot the toy lambIt stood on the chest of drawers in the nurserylooking off into the corners of the roomneglectedBy the time Uncle Edward and Aunt Bella sent for her to come and see the lambshe knew exactly what it would be like and what would happenShe saw it looking like the lambs in the Bible Picture Bookfatand covered with thickpure white woolShe saw Uncle Edwardwith his yellow face and big nose and black whiskerscoming to her across the lawn at Chadwell Grangecarrying the lamb over his shoulder like JesusIt was a cold morningThey drove a long time in Uncle Edward s carriageover the hardloud roadsbetween fields white with frostand Uncle Edward was not on his lawnAunt Bella stood in the big hallwaiting for themShe looked much larger and more important than Mamma Aunt Bellahave you got my new lamb She tried not to shriek it outbecause Aunt Bella was nearly always poorlyand Mamma had told her that if you shrieked at her she would be illMamma said Sh sh sh And Aunt Bella Whispered somethingand she heard Mamma answer Better notIf she sees it said Aunt Bella she ll understandMamma shook her head at Aunt Bella Edward would like it said Aunt Bella He wanted to give it her himself It s his present Mamma took her hand and they followed Aunt Bella through the servantshall into the kitchenThe servants were all thereRose and Annie and Cookand MrsFisher the housekeeper and Giles the young footmanThey all stared at her in a queerkind way as she came inA low screen was drawn close round one corner of the fireplaceUncle Edward and Pidgeonthe baliffwere doing something to it with a yellow horse clothUncle Edward came to herlooking down the side of his big noseHe led her to the screen and drew it awaySomething lay on the floor wrapped in a piece of dirty blanketWhen Uncle Edward pushed back the blanket a bad smell came outHe said Here s your lambMaryYou re just in time She saw a brownish grey animal with a queerhammer shaped head and long black legsIts body was drawn out and knotted like an enormous maggotIt lay twisted to one side and its eyes were shut That isn t my lambIt s the lamb I always said Miss Mary was to haveisn t itPidgeonYesSquoireits the lamb you bid me set aside for little MissyThen said Mary why does it look like thatIt s very ill Mamma said gently Poor Uncle Edward thought you d like to see it before it diedYou are glad you ve seen itaren t youNo Just then the lamb stirred in its blanketit opened its eyes and looked at herShe thought It s my lambIt looked at meIt s my lamb and it s dyingMy lamb s dyingThe bad smell came again out of the blanketShe tried not to think of itShe wanted to sit down on the floor beside the lamb and lift it out of its blanket and nurse itbut Mamma wouldn t let herWhen she got home Mamma took down the toy lamb from the chest of drawers and brought it to herShe sat quiet a long timeholding it in her lap and stroking itThe stiff eyes of the toy lamb still stared away over its ears111 Jenny was cross and tugged at your hair when she dressed you to go to Chadwell GrangeOne day

GrangeOne day she said I don t see why it should be always youMiss Maryand Master Roddy and Master Daniel and Master Mark never but just that onstI think it is me Mary said because I am so goodWellif you can be good to please your Aunt Bella you d oughter be good to please your MammaButJenny WeeI can t help itMamma says if I m not good Aunt Bella will be illDo you think it s really true Jenny tugged I d thank you for some of your Aunt Bella s illness she said I mean Mary said like Papa was in the nightEvery time I getcited and jump about I think she ll open her mouth and beginWellif she was toyou d oughter be sorry for herI am sorry for herBut I m frightened tooThat s not being good Jenny saidBut she left off tuggingSomehow you knew that she was pleased to think that you were not really good at Aunt Bella swhere MrsFisher dressed and undressed you and you were allowed to talk to PidgeonRoddy and Dank said you ought to hate Uncle Edward and Pidgeon and MrsFisherand not to like Aunt Bella very mucheven if she was Mamma s sisterEven Mamma didn t really like Uncle Edwardshe only pretended because of Aunt BellaMary liked him and pretended that she didn t because of Dank and RoddyUncle Edward had an ugly nose and a yellow face widened by his black whiskershis mouth stretched from one whisker to the otherand his black hair curled in large tufts above his earsBut he had no beardyou could see the whole of his mouth at onceand when Aunt Bella came into the room his little blue eyes looked up off the side of his nose and he smiled at her between his tufts of hairShe was sorry for Uncle EdwardIt was dreadful to think that Mark and Dank and Roddy didn t like himIt might hurt him so much that he would never be happy againAbout Pidgeon she was not quite surePidgeon was very uglyHe had long stiff legsand a long stiff face finished off with a fringe of red whiskers that went on under his chinStillit was not nice to think of widgeon being unhappyBut MrsFisher was large and rather like Aunt Bellaonly softer and more bulgingHer round face had a high red polish on it alwaysand when she saw you coming her eyes twinkledand her red forehead and her big cheeks and her mouth smiled all together a fatsimmering smileWhen you got to the black and white marble tiles you saw her waiting on the landing at the top of the stairsholding out her hand to you to come and be made tidyShe touched your hair gentlyeach stroke of the brush sent a delicious tingling up the back of your neck and down your spineand there was a great many red glass scent bottles and ivory and silver boxes on Aunt Bella s dressing table for you to play with while she did itShe wanted to ask MrsFisher if it was true that Aunt Bella would be ill if she were naughtybut a squeezing and dragging came under her waist whenever she thought about itand that made her shy and ashamedIt began as soon as Uncle Edward s carriage turned into the drive between the shining laurel bushesit got worse when Aunt Bella came into the hall and kissed herand it lasted till they sent her out to play by herself on the lawn in sight of the houseAunt Bella s house was enormousTwo long rows of windows stared out at youtheir dark green storm shutters folded back on the yellow brick wallsA third row of little squeezed up windows and little squeezed up shutters blinked in the narrow space under the roofAll summer a sweet smell came from that side of the house where cream coloured roses hung on the yellow walls between the green shuttersThere was a cedar tree on the lawn and a sundial and a stone fountainGold fish swam in the clear greenish waterThe flowers in the round beds were stiff and shining as if they had been cut out of tin and freshly paintedWhen you thought of Aunt Bella s garden you saw calceolariasbrown velvet purses with yellow spotsShe could always get away from Aunt Bella by going down the dark walk between the yew hedge and the window of MrsFisher s roomand through the stable yard into the plantationThe cocks and hens had their black timber house there in the clearingand Pontothe Newfoundlandlived all by himself in his kennel under the little ragged fir treesWhen Ponto saw her coming he danced on hind legs and strained at his chain and called to her with his loudbarking howlHe played with hercrawling on his stomachcrouchingraising first one big paw and then the otherShe put out her foot and he caught it and held it between his big pawsand looked at it with his head on one sidesmilingShe squealed with delightand Ponto barked againThe stable bell would ring while they played in the plantationand Uncle Edward or Pidgeon or MrsFisher would come out and find her and take her back into the housePonto lifted up his head and Ponto howled after she wentAt lunch she sat quivering between Mamma and Aunt BellaThe squeezing and dragging went on under her waist worse than everThere was a pattern of green ivy round the dinner plates and a pattern of goats round the silver napkin ringsShe tried to fix her mind on the ivy and the goats instead of looking at Aunt Bella to see whether she were going to be illShe would be if you left mud in the hall on the black and white marble tilesOr if you took Ponto off the chain and let him get into the houseOr if you spilled your gravy on the tableclothAunt Bella s face was much pinker and richer and more important than Mamma s faceShe thought she wouldn t have minded quite so much if Aunt Bella had been white and brown and prettylike MammaThere she had spilled the gravyLittle knots came in Aunt Bella s pink foreheadHer face loosened and swelled with a red flushher mouth pouted and drew itself in againpulled out of shape by something that darted up the side of her nose and made her blinkShe thought I know I know I know it s going to happen It didn tAunt Bella only said You should look at your plate and spoondear When Uncle Edward said I wouldn t touch that cheese if I were youBellayou know it made you ill yesterday she said out loud Please pleaseAunt Belladon t touch it Aunt Bella said Capers and nonsense and took the biggest piece Bless the childdoes she want to be ill Mary had turned from the table and hidden her face behind Mamma s shoulder I think she wants to be naughty said MammaMamma didn t knowUncle Edward and Pidgeon and MrsFisher knewWhen they saw naughtiness coming they held out their hands to you behind their backs and took you somewhere where it couldn t happenEither you went with Uncle Edward round the stables and the farm yardor Pidgeon carried you on his back to feed the calvesor MrsFisher took you up into her bedroom to see her dressIn MrsFisher s bedroom a smell of rotton apples oozed through the rosebud pattern on the wallsThere were no doors insideonly places in the wall paper that openedBehind one of these places there was a cupboard where MrsFisher kept her clothesSometimes she would take the lid off the big box covered with wall paper and show you her Sunday bonnetYou sat on the bed and she gave you peppermint balls to suck while she peeled off her black merino and squeezed herself into her black silkYou watched for the moment when the brooch with the black tomb and the weeping willow on it was undonand MrsFisher s chin came out first by the open collarand MrsFisher began to swellWhen she stood up in her petticoat and bodice she was enormousher breasts and hips and her great arms shook as she walked about the roomWhen it was all over she took you downstairs and gave you tea with strawberry jam and apple jelly in her little dark room that looked on to the yew hedgeSometimesAunt Bella would come in and look at youand she and MrsFisher would talk about you as if you were not there Has Miss Mary been good today As good as goldma amBe sure you tell MrsOlivier This afternoon MrsFisher said See how pretty she isma amwhen her hair s done proper Aunt Bella shook her head MrsOlivier won t be pleased if you spoil herThere s some said MrsFisher as would do with more spoiling and some as would do with lessMrsOlivier ll not be pleased till we ve asked Master Mark and Master Daniel and Master Rodney to stay againWe shall have to do it some dayFisher said Aunt BellaMary was sorry when she said good bye to Uncle Edward and Aunt Bella and MrsFisherForalwaysas soon as she got homeRoddy rushed at her with the same questions Did you let Uncle Edward kiss you YesDid you talk to PidgeonYesDid you kiss MrsFisherYes And Dank said Have they taken Ponto off the chain yetNoWell thenthat shows you what pigs they are And when she saw Mark looking at her she felt small and silly and ashamedII It was the last week of the midsummer holidaysMark and Dank had gone to stay for three days at Aunt Bella sand on the second day they had been sent homeMamma and Roddy were in the garden when they cameThey were killing snails in a flower pot by putting salt on themThe snails turned over and over on each other and spat out a green foam that covered them like soap suds as they diedMark s face was red and he was smilingEven Dank looked proud of himself and happyThey called out together We ve been sent home Mamma looked up from her flower pot What did you do she said We took Ponto off the chain said Dank Did he get into the houseOf course he did said Mark Like a shotHe got into Aunt Bella s bedroom and Aunt Bella was in bedOhMarkUncle Edward came up just as we were getting him outHe was in an awful waxI m afraid Dank said I cheeked himWhat did you sayI told him he wasn t fit to have a dogAnd he said we weren t to come againand Marksaid that was all we had come for to let Ponto loose Mamma put another snail into the flower potvery gentlyShe was smiling and at the same time trying not to smile He went back said Mark and raked it up again about our chasing his sheepages agoDid you chasehis sheepNoOf course we didn tThey started to run because they saw Pidgeon comingand Roddy ran after them till we told him not toThe mean beast said we d made Mary s lamb die by frightening its motherWhen he only gave it her because he knew it wouldn t liveThen he said we d frightened Aunt Bella Mary stared at themfascinated OhMarkwas Aunt Bella illOf course she wasn tShe only says she s going to beto keep you quietWell said Mamma she won t be frightened any moreHe ll not ask you againWe don t carehe s not a bit of goodHe won t let us ride his horses or climb his trees or fish in his stinking pondLet Mary go there said Dank She likes itShe kisses PidgeonI don tshe cried I hate PidgeonI hate Uncle Edward and Aunt BellaI hate MrsFisher Mamma looked up from her flower potandsuddenlyshe was angry For shameThey re kind to you she said You little naughtyungrateful girlThey re not kind to Mark and DankThat s why I hate them She wondered why Mamma was not angry with Mark and Dankwho had let Ponto loose and frightened Aunt Bellato be continued NOTES ON MUSIC AND THE THEATREand the CriticsMargaret Anderson Criticism inChicago To read the book pages of the Chicago newspapers has suddenly become a matter of sharp irritation to meThey have always been badsince Francis Hackett and Floyd Dell did for the Chicago Evening Post what no one in this country has managed to doTheyI mean the newspapershave been too bad for irritation in their recent droolings about James Joyce and their nauseating personal publicity that has served as literary notesBut the clippings I have seen from the Tribunethe Post and the News for the last two weeksand which bear at least some signs of mental activityleave me far more annoyedThey revive in me a memory of championing thenewagainst theoldtwo words I no longer usejust as I no longer talk of the distinction between radical and conservativenow that I have learned the stupidities shared in common by these two great classes of unborn peopleBut perhapsnewandoldcan be found to have further meaningI know that when James Huneker writes rhaposodies about Mary Garden s art in the New York Times Iwho believe in Mary Garden s geniusam left embarrassed and amused and bewilderedThe mind that writes seems not so much inept as it seems just oldit talks of values that are no longer the concern of aestheticswhat Mary Garden doesn t doand never can doit finds some imaginary reason to applaudwhat she does dothe whole particular realm of her expressionit passes by as innocently as if it had never observed herThis kind of oldness of the mindand many quite young people have itmakes a man like Huneker say Matzenauer is more exotica sentence without meaninghowever you may stretch itnot that Mary Garden is exoticbut thatexoticcan no longer be applied to things of obvious warmth and patent emotionsThis kind of oldness makes a critic like Huneker trace the Wagnerian influence in DebussyConceive itWhat has anewmind to say about these thingsIt saysWagner was the kind of man whose music is a cryDebussy is the kind of man whose musk is a calltwo human beings can t be more separated than by this differencetwo artists can t be more divergentcan t have less to give each otherIt saysWagner sTristanwas so foreign to anything Debussy would feel that the latter probably thought the Tristan story had never been conceived in musicand was at work on aTristanof his own that would have as little relation to the Wagnerian as a trained person has to an obvious oneIt is this kind of irritation I get from Burton RascoeJohn VAWeaverSusan Wilburet alHenry Blackman Sell of course is not even in the runningLlewellyn Jones has always had this red flag quality to meexcept when he writes of the things he knows aboutthe mind of manfor instanceor Walter De La Mare s poetryBut when all these people talk of theartof Alfred KreymborgConrad AikenRobert NicholsI have nothing against Kreymborg s work except that it has neither art nor ideasit has a whimsicality which I don t call humour but the indication of a carefully made fictitious goalI have nothing against Aiken s work except that on occasion he likes to glorify the average manI have nothing against Robert Nicholswork except that a poet simply cannot belong to the Georgianstodayand write Georgian versewithout being unaware of the currents that have swept through modern lifeAnd when these same critics devote their time to damning Ezra PoundI turn to Pound with great reliefHis mind seems to be in tempoHe has a quality of thoughtBarring two things his wearisome vituperations of a country and a people beneath his noticeand his complete lack of ideas about the war Pound is interestingHe knows what is happening in the worldwhat hashappened and something of what is likely to happenOf course in talking of these irritations I am talking of very simple propositionsMany people decide that they will be artistsTo them there is nothing naive in thisThey believe it is possibleI shall content myself with saying that this is not the way it happens with a James Joyceand that even if it does so happen with an Ezra Poundat least Pound has enough brains to make the process interestingchiefly I suppose because he knows that no belief in the commonplace and no glorificaiton of it will make a man s work anything but transientundistinguishedand unworthyBecause we insist that a thing must have some contact with eternal essencesthe Little Review is described as having an awfulsolemnity And magazines like the Playboy are started to correct this condition by giving every one a chance to be as happily shallow and mediocre as possibleNearly every one has these potentialitiesI can t see why exalt themAs One Would Not Harriet Monroe came to town and talked to the Poetry Society or to some kind of society that I am fortunate enough to avoid instinctivelyBut I had a little talk with her one morning which we could have made into asolemndiscussionuntil I promised to spare her the boredom of my repetitious remarks about what is and what is not ArtShe was sayingAnd you don t like Galli CurciTo me she is really an artist in her slightrococo way Andwhen I objected I mean just as Louis Quinze furniture is art I objected again Of course that is an unfortunate exampleI didn t mean anything so artificial as Louis Quinze I objected againAnd then we laughed and let it goButall this might serve as an explanation of why I wanted to start a Little Reviewnamelythat when you talk of Galli Curci or Caruso or McCormacketc etc you are not talking of anything that has to do with the old fiery fountains except to remind you again that they are far offthat when you think of Louis Quinze furniture as Art you are destroying all separations between craft and aestheticsand when you call such furniture or such a period artificial you are destroying all the finer possibilities of thoughtA group of Russians killing themselves over the problem of the universe can be just as artificial as the spectacle of Louiscourt laughing its way to deathManners are not the criterion of artificialitySusan Glas pell s New Play The Provincetown Players have just given Susan Glaspell sBernice It made a stir among the intellectualsand the critics uptown praised it highly which is very goodThey even discovered that Ida Rauh can actwhich is also goodBut I am interested in this play as a very fine example of a piece of work without contentIt is well writtenit was well presentedit is an interesting idea to focus three acts upon the interval between a woman s death and her funeralshowing the effect of this catastrophe upon her husbandher best woman friendher fatherher husband s sisterand the family maid of all workI sat tense with interest up to the middle of the last actThe alleged drama centers in the husbandBut there is no dramaThis is all I wish to proveYou must either work through cause and effect to get dramaor you must present dramatically the foibles of a human being who dramatizes himself with charmintelligenceor poweror a human being who tries to dramatize himself and failsor any of the variations upon this materialAll playwrights who deal with ideas as muchperhaps I should say with general ideasor with propagandawork in the first realmSusan Glaspell doesTherefore she must present some intellectual or psychic conflictTaking for her hero a man without power she gives him power through the reportcarefully arranged for by the wife before she diesthat she has killed herself because she loves himSuch an ideathat a person without power ever gains it through any source is a lieAnd you can t make drama out of this kind of lie without giving your discriminating audience the feeling that your play is without contextDon t you seeSusan GlaspellYou can make a drama out of it by having your hero subconsciously aware of what he is doing and you can do this without going into farceor you can make him a man who is notonto himselfas you didand who makes his elaborate dramatization of himself quite unconsciouslybut some one must beonto what is happeningeither a character in the play or you yourself when you writeI have just touched the fringe of the discussionI wish you would take it up with meMoli√®reWe were in Philadelphia for the second night of Philip Moeller sMoli√®re which opened at the old Broad Street TheatreMrMoeller happened to be in the audience and we caught him and forced our congratulations upon himHe seemed a bit incredulous at first and then wanted to know why and how we liked his playI don t know why people suspect us of never indulging in sentimentality or the other human emotionsI could only repeatI really like it And this is trueIt is a good play and at the last curtain I wept in just the way all playwrights and producers must want you to weepI am not jokingI legitimately weptAnd I can say nothing more without beingsolemn To write a play likeMoli√®rehas nothing to do with creationYou start with a love and understanding of the life of a great manYou find out all you can about himYou concentrate the drama of his lifeby skillful manipulationinto a three hour pictureYou take much care for the way it shall be told for the economy and beauty of your linesetc etcAll this demands much effort and much skillOf course people like itEveryone likes a good storywell illustratedHenry Miller as Moli√®re looked rather squat in the first two actsand like Christ in the last oneBlanche Bates should score a hitshe does what is known as good emotional actingthe only strange thing to me was that the emotions registered in such an unrelatedAmerican mannerHolbrook Blinn as Louis the Grand suggested a kind of plain business suit aggressiveness and a war time economy of royaltyMrsFiske MrsFiske inMisNellie of NOrleansis doing a delightful thingplaying the kind of woman who knows how to train her natural

reservation that the greatest musical experience I have had for three or four yearssince I heard Scriabin sPrometheusplayedwas Leopold Stokowski s conducting of that composer sPoeme dExtase The Philadelphia Orchestra must rank next to the Bostonit is certainly the best I have heardwith that exceptionStokowski is full of nuauceand musical to the point of looking itHis muscular articulation is entirely rhythmicalbeautiful to seeand he conducts always without a scoreOlga Samaroff played with him on this occasionOne cannot write of her in relation to the newer developments of the pianoHer playing is built upon the older standardslike that of Gabrilowitschfor exampleThey play always with an inflexibility that allows the piano only about half its full vibrationsBauer has shown pianists how to correct thisI wonder why any one playing the piano today fails to take advantage of his illustrationI shall not go into detailsthough I should like toHowever if there is any interest in the

toldProbably primitive utilitarnianism developed gesture before speech When you want to know what primitive man did in a given situation go ask the animals and the babies Not to go back quite so far we will assume speechA story told and retold becomes a legendDevelopsa disposition to beguile oneself and othersto lend variety to expression and so excite admirationIn obedience to these impulses the story is play acted outThat is the dancethe songthe gameThe first drawing or carving would be merely a story told through fingers instead of lips and hence a kind of gestureA permanent gestureOut of the dancethe songthe gamethe carvingwas eventually fabricated the ritualbut a ritual implies a composite tradition which in turn implies an organized societyThe ritual must be a late social developmentPeople lived and amused themselves before they developed organizationAlso they must have lived and amused themselves before they acquired a speculative disposition and there could be no concept of the supernatural until speculation had brewed for longThe notion of parley or bargain with the supernatural would come later stillOut of this notion develops magicMagic is the appropriation to dealings with the Unknown of the various accomplishments of which primitive humans found themselves capable including their sexual accomplishmentsEstablished magic is ritualUpon the ritual was grafted the priestan individual who utilized it as a prerogativeto his own personal advantageThe priest as the head of the familyThe priesthood was the first master class of a society which had
