MOUNTAIN POEMS  THE WATER OUZEL  LITTLE brown surf bather of the mountains Spirit of foam lover of cataracts shaking your wings in falling waters Have you no fear of the roar and rush when Nevada plunges Nevada the shapely dancer feeling her way with slim  white fingers How dare you dash at Yosemite the mighty Tall white limbed Yosemite leaping down down over  the cliff Is it not enough to lean on the blue air of mountains Is it not enough to rest with your mate at timber line in  bushes that hug the rocks Must you èy through made waters where the heaped up granite breaks them   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Must you batter your wings in the torrent Must you plunge for life or death through the foam  THE PINE AT TIMBER LINE  What has bent you Warped and twisted you Torn and crippled you What has embittered you O lonely tree  You search the rocks for a footing dragging scrawny roots You bare your thin breast to the storms and fling out wild arms behind you You throw back your witch like head with wisps of hair stringing the wind  You fight with the snows You rail and shriek at the tempests Old before your time you challenge the cold stars  Be still be satisfied Stand straight like your brothers in the valley The soft green valley of summer down below   The Pine at Timber Line  Why front the endless winter of the peak Why seize the lightning in your riven hands Why cut the driven wind and shriek aloud  Why tarry here  A LADY OF THE SNOWS  The mountain hemlock droops her lacy branches Oh so tenderly In the summer sun Yet she has power to baffle avalanches She rising slenderly Where the rivers run  So pliant yet so powerful Oh see her Spread alluringly Her thin sea green dress Now from white winter s thrall the sun would free her To bloom unenduringly In his glad caress   OS THE PORCH  As I lie roofed in screened in From the pattering rain The summer rain As I lie Snug and dry And hear the birds complain  Oh billow on billow Oh roar on roar Over me wash The seas of war Over me down down Lunges and plunges The huge gun with its one blind eye The armored train And swooping out of the sky The aeroplane Down down The army proudly swinging Under gay flags The glorious dead heaped up like rags A church with bronze bells ringing A city all towers Gardens of lovers and flowers The round world swinging   On the Porch  In the light of the sun All broken undone All down under Black surges of thunder   Oh billow on billow Oh roar on roar Over me wash The seas of war  As I lie roofed in screened in From the pattering rain The summer rain As I lie Snug and dry And hear the birds complain  MOUNTAIN SONG  I have not where to lay my head Upon my breast no child shall lie For me no marriage feast is spread I walk alone under the sky  My staff and scrip I cast away Light burdened to the mountain height   Climbing the rocky steep by day Kindling my fire against the night  The bitter hail shall flower the peak The icy wind shall dry my tears Strong shall I be who am but weak  When bright Orion spears my fears  Under the horned moon I shall rise Up swinging on the scarf of dawn The sun searching with level eyes Shall take my hand and lead me on  Wide flaming pinions veil the West Ah shall I find and shall I know My feet are bound upon the Quest Over the Great Divide I go  Harriet Monroe   POST 4NN0S  Yolande dit en soupirant  It is long since we met she said I answered Yes  She is not fair But very old now and no gold Gleams in that scant gray withered hair Where once much gold was and I think Not easily might one bring tears Into her eyes which have become Like dusty glass  Tis thirty years I said And then the war came on Apace and our young king had need Of men to serve him oversea Against the heathen For their greed Puffed up at Tunis irks him sore  She said This week my son is gone To him at Paris with his men And then You never married John  I answered No And so we sate Musing a while Then with his guests Came Robert and his thin voice broke   Upon my dream with the old jests  No food for laughter now and swore  We must be friends now that our feud  Was overpast  We are grown old Eh John he said And by the Rood Tis time we were at peace with God Who are not long for this world  Yea I answered we are old And then Remembering that April day At Calais and that hawthorn field Wherein we fought long since I said We are friends now  And she sate by Scarce heeding Thus the evening sped  And we ride homeward now and I Ride moodily my palfrey jogs Along a rock strewn way the moon Lights up for us yonder the bogs Are curdled with thin ice the trees Are naked from the barren wold The wind comes like a blade aslant Across a world grown very old  James Branch Cabell   TH E APPLE TREE  I saw the archangels in my apple tree last night I saw them like great birds in the starlight Purple and burning blue crimson and shining white  And each to each they tossed an apple to and fro And once I heard their laughter gay and low And yet I felt no wonder that it should be so  But when the apple came one time to Michael s lap I heard him say The mysteries that enwrap The earth and fill the heavens can be read here mayhap  Then Gabriel spoke I praise the deed the hidden thing The beauty of the blossom of the spring I praise cried Raphael Uriel The wise leaves I sing  And Michael I will praise the fruit perfected round Full of the love of God herein being bound His mercies gathered from the sun and rain and ground  So sang they till a small wind through the branches stirred And spoke of coming dawn and at its word Each fled away to heaven winged like a bird   THE MONKEY  I saw you hunched and shivering on the stones The bleak wind piercing to your fragile bones Your shabby scarlet all inadequate A little ape that had such human eyes They seemed to hide behind their miseries Their dumb and hopeless bowing down to fate Some puzzled wonder Was your monkey soul Sickening with memories of gorgeous days Of tropic playfellows and forest ways Where agile you could swing from bole to bole In an enchanted twilight with great flowers For stars or on a bough the long night hours Sit out in rows and chatter at the moon Shuffling you went your tiny chilly hand Outstretched for what you did not understand Your puckered mournful face begging a boon That but enslaved you more They who passed by Saw nothing sorrowful gave laugh or stare Unheeding that the little antic there Played in the gutter such a tragedy  Nancy Campbell   THE WATERFALL  O little misty waterfall Down from the sky land blown Why do the mountains loom so tall And why do the fir trees moan O little wistful waterfall How still is the evening grown  Thine eyes are dim little waterfall Thy voice is a faint faint sigh Ah must I follow thee after all Away from the Land of the Sky  Elhvood Colahan  THE SUMMER SEA  After the Japanese manner  Unbroken by a ripple but yet drifting Onward in long wide billows vast and free Upon its bosom ship and shadow lifting Beneath the sunset lies the summer sea  Nathan Haskell Dole   TH E CRAG  Once I was a crag crowning the peak s sharp crest My red flanks bared to the golden sun My sharp serried comb breaking the loose textured low fleet  ing clouds  And once I was the sudden swift moving shadow upon the crag Fallen from a white high sailing cloud  Once I was the cone heavy tree upon the crag Tossing long needles in the wind Breathing sweet fragrance to the air  And once I was the glistening spider s thread spun deftly from needle to needle  These I was once Unthinking Untroubled by whence or whither or why Knowing not Of yesterday tomorrow today Of loneliness desire or love or joy Thus I was once  And once I was the blue blue sky above And made men glad  Louise Mallinkrodt Kueffner   POEMS OF LIFE AND DEATH  ANNUNCIATION  Life The great Life Came unto me He of old ages The eternal The owner of all Came and his word was for me Calling my name And the radiance of his presence shone about me  With leaping heart I heard his voice And the entering of his steps over my threshold Heard and was not troubled Because it was known to me a long time What answer I should make to Life  With outstretched quiet hands With unreluctant face I stood before him And let my eyes look into the eyes of Life And I gave and delivered up to Life Myself Utterly Yielding me   As one yields and delivers to another A dumb vessel  Mighty and splendid is the presence of Life  By a far road he comes  And travels a great way before  And sways the world I trembled to be near his glory  But with unbowing head I stood before him  With unbowing head and proud heart  Knowing my service that I should perform to the honoring of Life And in his dignity I was exalted  Now for a term I am not my own But Life is my master And I dwell under his commandment Beneath the fostering of his wings Wrapped in the mantle of Life Patient by ways apart I go Bearing in my flesh his sign That I am one of his chosen The instrument of his purpose the way of his will  Slowly day follows day Laying its hands upon me with invisible touch Molding my flesh And I tarry waiting upon Life Until the use he purposes for me shall be accomplished   Annunciation  And his intent be fulfilled Until the wonder is wrought upon me that now possesses my days  TH E NEW BORN  I have heard them in the night The cry of their fear Because there is no light Because they do not hear Familiar sounds and feel the familiar arm And they awake alone Yet they have never known Danger or harm What is their dread This dark about their bed But they are so lately come Out of the dark womb Where they were safely kept That blackness was good And the silence of that solitude Wherein they slept Was kind Where did they find Knowledge of death Caution of darkness and cold These of the little new breath Have they a prudence so old   RAIN AT NIGHT  Are you awake Do you hear the rain How rushingly it strikes upon the ground And on the roof and the wet window pane Sometimes I think it is a comfortable sound Making us feel how safe and snug we are Closing us off in this dark away from the dark outside The rest of the world seems dim tonight mysterious and  far Oh there is no world left Only darkness darkness stretching wide And full of the blind rain s immeasurable fall  How nothing must we seem unto this ancient thing How nothing unto the earth and we so small Oh wake wake do you not feel my hands cling One day it will be raining as it rains tonight the same wind  blowing Raining and blowing on this house wherein we lie but you  and I We shall not hear we shall not ever know O love I had forgot that we must die  SINCE I HAVE FELT THE SENSE OF DEATH  Since I have felt the sense of death Since I have borne its dread its fear   Since I Have Felt the Sense of Death  Oh how my life has grown more dear  Since I have felt the sense of death Sorrows are good and cares are small Since I have known the loss of all  Since I have felt the sense of death And death forever at my side Oh how the world has opened wide  Since I have felt the sense of death My hours are jewels that I spend For I have seen the hours end  Since I have felt the sense of death Since I have looked on that black night My inmost brain is fierce with light  Since I have felt the sense of death O dark that made my eyes to see O death that gave my life to me  ACTION POEM  À Song to Wake Your Dear in the Morning  I kiss the locks of your hair Do you feel me there Sleepy one   I will put a kiss on your brow Are you waking now Won t you wake sleepy one  A kiss on your left eye on your right Closed tight closed tight Oh you are a hard one to wake  A kiss on your nose Where your deep breath goes Sleepy one  Now a kiss for each ear Do you hear do you hear Wake sleepy one  A kiss for this cheek a kiss for this How many kisses you will miss Won t you wake Won t you wake  Now I come to your lips that I love Oh you are waking You wake and move Sleepy one  Sleepy one My kisses are done Oh you are a hard one to wake  Helen Hoyt   THE CITY  Haunted By furtive fear of Heaven s wrath For wallowing in the mire Each day With a coward s mockery of courage The city hurls a monumental oath Of brick and mortar Far up into the air  These are the sky tipped towers Of terrifying height Rising from the swamp black wilderness of greed A frothy challenge to the gods From snarling lips  Max Endicoff   ON A WINDOW DISPLAY IN A WESTERN CITY  He changed the card and pointed and he twirled himself  around To show the sack suit s jaunty cut a twenty dollar treat Behind the wide show window s glass he ogled strutted  frowned Disposed his collar shot his cuffs and twinkled head to feet I stood amid the gaping crowd and watched him from the street  That vest adjusting marionette that little lacquered slave In serge and tweed without a crease disported deft and droll To coax our custom Left and right he postured pert or grave He arched his chest he tried to smoothe what creases from his soul I wondered if his underwear was one great thread webbed hole  A subtle pathos reached from him for all his flashy strut We all would fain usurp the stage Twas his heroic dream But warped by shrewd necessity a climbing from the rut Like some bedraggled butterfly that crawls from grime to  gleam However evanescent where the public dump heaps steam   On a Window Display in a Western City  Tin cans and broken bottles often flash a diamond ray A little sun will dry the mire on wings that missed their  mark I wondered whither went his bright shod feet at end of day Did drink or drugs devour his soul Perhaps in mornings  dark He crawled to some damp bench and stretched neath papers in the park  Such thoughts contribute saving grace Believe them Lord I must If voluntary choice were this it turns the stomach quite Where once these streets were open range horned cattle stamped the dust And bronzed and brown unknown to town s insane electric light Beneath the deep blue star pricked skies men rode the herd by night  William Rose Benêt   DEATH AND THE AVIATOR  Joyously he dips and flies  Floats at ease in the windy skies  Where the changing cloud hosts run  Fragile winged between earth and sun  Strong in youth and seeming free  And he rides O Death with thee  Piteous and a broken thing Solemn slow the mourners bring Crushed the torch and quenched the fire Of his prophet s keen desire Where oh where the living flame Spirit thou alone could st tame  INCONSISTENCY  Proud man compact of fire and clod Doth logic lack indeed Creates strong swift and free his god Then binds him with a creed  Wanda Petrunkevitch   ONE LISTENS  I heard Death singing Lone was the darkening way The song was a glad song ringing Far faint and gay But pale poppies were clinging To the feet that went that way  Gay faint bugles of Death Airily blowing Poppies of strange cold breath Frailly growing And around and above and beneath A faint wind blowing  A weak wind wearily blowing Like a blown winding sheet That wrapped me in its dread flowing From face to feet A wind that seemed as if blowing Between the earth and my feet  Far farther than wonder Could follow or dreams The sunken sun lay under The furthest streams   Far beyond longing or wonder Or dreams  Death s song like a nightingale s cry Through that lone dark Pierced it wildly and high And my heart said Hark Tis the nightingale s cry Nay said my soul the lark  But poppies impeded my treading Sleep and great fear fell upon me What dews of what cold shedding Were these shed upon me Behind me no way for treading No way beyond me  And gay faint bugles of Death Airily blowing Poppies of strange cold breath Frailly growing And around and above and beneath A faint wind blowing  Louise Adèle Carter   BATTLE  THE GOING  He s gone I do not understand I only know That as he turned to go And waved his hand In his young eyes a sudden glory shone And I was dazzled by a sunset glow And he was gone  THE JOKE  He d even have his joke While we were sitting tight And so he needs must poke His silly head in sight To whisper some new jest Chortling But as he spoke A rifle cracked And now God knows when I shall hear the rest   NIGHTMARE  They gave him a shilling They gave him a gun And so he s gone killing The Germans my son  I dream of that shilling I dream of that gun And it s they that are killing The boy who s my son  IN THE AMBULANCE  Two rows of cabbages Two of curly greens Two rows of early peas Two of kidney beans  That s what he is muttering Making such a song Keeping other chaps awake The whole night long  Both his legs are shot away And his head is light   In the Ambulance  So he keeps on muttering All the blessed night  Two rows of cabbages Two of curly greens Two rows of early peas Two of kidney beans  HIT  Out of the sparkling sea I drew my tingling body clear and lay On a low ledge the livelong summer day Basking and watching lazily White sails in Falmouth Bay  My body seemed to burn Salt in the sun that drenched it through and through Till every particle glowed clean and new And slowly seemed to turn To lucent amber in a world of blue   I felt a sudden wrench A trickle of warm blood And found that I was sprawling in the mud Among the dead men in the trench   THE HOUSEWIFE  She must go back she said Because she d not had time to make the bed We d hurried her away So roughly and for all that we could say She broke from us and passed Into the night shells falling thick and fast  HILL BORN  I sometimes wonder if it s really true I ever knew Another life Than this unending strife With unseen enemies in lowland mud And wonder if my blood Thrilled ever to the tune Of clean winds blowing through an April noon Mile after sunny mile On the green ridges of the Windy Gile  THE FEAR  I do not fear to die Neath the open sky   The Fear  To meet death in the fight Face to face upright  But when at last we creep Into a hole to sleep I tremble cold with dread Lest I wake up dead  BACK  They ask me where I ve been And what I ve done and seen But what can I reply Who know it wasn t I But someone just like me Who went across the sea And with my head and hands Slew men in foreign lands Though I must bear the blame Because he bore my name  Wilfrid Wilson Gibson  COMMENTS AND REVIEWS  IN CATHAY  H O shall outwit death but he who builds  who sings but he who creates beauty too  beautiful to die  It is morning in Peking The Forbidden  City lifts its yellow roofs to the sun roofs that curve to their tips like a slim new moon and perch brave files of mocking animals It is the third reign from the great founder of the dynasty that conqueror of the world who destroyed his enemies and levelled their monuments and who lies entombed in the Southern Hills guarded by stone beasts and counsellors who hush the desert Now have his son and his son s son magnificently reigning commanded the builder the carver the painter to erect and adorn new monuments more haughty than the old and the poet to chant their glory in high words to the sound of flutes and fountains  Today a long procession winds over the bridge the high curving moon marble bridge whose balustrade is curled into sea foam and coiled into dragons Below pink lotus flowers push out of the shining water and beyond a slender tiled pagoda blooms in purple and turquoise out of the green Little laughing boys pass by bearing high poles with long pointed streamers that gild the wind Men follow with banners oh hundreds silken banners that lift to the sun   In Cathay  in patterned embroideries of many colors the glory of him the Emperor and his ancestors Banners round and square banners blue and crimson white cylindrical banners whose story never ends borne by ivory colored slant eyed men in silken coats aflare like rainbows  And who are these bringing gifts In the hand of one is a bowl glazed with the blue of forgotten seas another holds high a long necked silver swan tall in its pride In the carved box of another is rolled a landscape painted in powder of malachite and lapis lazuli with the dreams of ten thousand years Another brings a vase in the four colors pictured with ladies of an ancient reign court ladies in trellised gardens with kingfisher feather jewels in their hair and rich robes enwinding their slow little feet And others bear precious charms carved in turquoise and amethyst and emerald or little ivory sages in lacquered boxes or finely tapestried silken panels woven into fables of the phoenix bird And one lifts high a wonder work of moon white jade wrought day after day life after life into an image of Lord Buddha throned on the lotus Lord Buddha with jasper eyes fixed in rapture his right hand extending two fingers to bless the world  But where are they going these gift bearers attended by eunuchs in gorgeous coats each worth a mandarin s tribute by palace guards mailed and sworded and terrible by musicians ringing bells and beating drums by hordes of retainers more gorgeous than poppies in the sun And followed yes   by princes and viceroys from far provinces each with his strange and splendid retinue  They turn from the bridge into the lacquered walk whose pillared roof tiled without and painted within answers with many colors the challenge of the sun Slowly they file between the crimson columns and draw near the bright roofs of the sacred dwelling to prostrate themselves before the Dragon Throne and lay their gifts in heaps beneath it For is it not the birthday of the Son of Heaven of him the mighty and glorious brother of the sun and sister of the moon who shall possess the earth ten thousand years  The gilded banners salute the sacred roofs of six colors the roofs yellow and green turquoise and heliotrope blue green and sapphire softly shining with the little guardian animals ever peeking and prinking at the corners They begin to ascend the low white steps to the Hall of Audiences while the long procession lies winding like a serpent back through the walk over the bridge into the wood and beyond  Why do they halt and delay a moment a prayer s length hour after hour Why do the long lines pause motionless their rich robes and trappings a sparkle in the sun Why does the Son of Heaven linger alone in the anteroom contemplative absorbed ecstatic the Son of Heaven radiant with youth and power his yellow k o sse robe woven with the twelve symbols of power his brow adorned with the magic emerald carved long ago by his divine ancestors in heaven Why does he not rise and go forth to his dragon carved throne and take proud possession of his state   In Cathay  while the long files approach and fall prostrate before him and heap their gifts at his feet  The Son of Heaven sits motionless in his yellow robe with its twelve symbols of power his brow lit green by the magic emerald Hour after hour he sits cross legged contemplative while the long procession waits in the sun  For the Son of Heaven is making a poem a little poem in five lines which shall give sound and shape to the world  H M  REVIEWS  The Alan on the Hill Top by Arthur Davison Ficke Ken  nerley  Blank verse unrhymed iambic pentameter has been recognized as an expressive medium of intimate spiritual biography ever since the voice of Marlowe s Faustus said to the dream woman of his desire  Oh thou art fairer than the evening air Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars  The dullness of most contemporary blank verse seems to be imparted by the author s total failure to handle the extremely varied accent and conversational intervals of the line with any vital understanding of its sovereign power in speaking the movement of meditation the pacing step of absorbed revery as it slowly turns a corner down the mysterious cloisters of the soul   One recalls with pleasure the running parody in Sheri  dan s Critic of blank verse as a mere grandiose record of outer event  Enter Governor with his hair properly disordered  A hemisphere of evil planets reigns And every planet sheds contagious fury My Spanish prisoner is ta en My daughter Meeting the dead corse borne along is gone Distract  Though The Man on the Hilltop is written in Unrhymed iambic pentameter and by a contemporary poet its first excellence is that it does express spiritual biography It is the story of a man who has known as a child the injustice in the world In this case it is in the workaday world of mills and of courts that he has felt the insolence of office and the  spurns that patient merit from the unworthy takes  These things Seen by a child who with his mother stood Three younger ones beside him and looked out Into the endless and appalling void Of destitution could not be forgot But needs must bend the corner of the mouth And sink the eyes to sparks in their deep caves  He leaves the life of the forge as he grows to be a man and becomes a shepherd in the West Here though no longer struggling with poverty he broods upon the history of his dead of his scattered family of the laborers of the earth  broods until his mind wreaks upon itself a doom which only the poet should reveal to his readers The poem is a true tragedy told in fitting music simple and sincere   Reviews  It must be confessed that on gathering from a glance ahead that the next poem was about Theodorus a noble monk of Athens the old Abbot and a gray walled monastery the reviewer began to suspect that here she might find a text chiefly woven of the same material as My Spanish prisoner is ta en  It is true that At Saint Stephanos is marred by a few cannery phrases and lines  My approaching step Echoed upon the drawbridge whose frail span Nevertheless the general musical style of the poem has the interesting characteristic the first poem indicated of evoking a mind s biography At Saint Stephanos speaks in the voice of Theodorus the lover of beauty the devotee of poets with the tongue of a peculiar sympathy not only for those who have longed to realize poetry in their own lives but for the music makers themselves the dreamers of dreams the builders and makers of the world forever Sympathy for the poetry of the world is indeed well spoken in tones of varying lightness and depth throughout the volume As in The Gentle Reader  Why does the poet chose to sing No impulse ever stirred in me The wish to make myself a thing To which all mocking jibes might cling  Perhaps he sees more than you see  Why should this fool go crying out The secrets of his soul In steel I case myself nor care to shout   The things one does not talk about  Perhaps he feels more than you feel  If I had wisdom to impart I d say the thing and let it go Not trifle with a foolish art And make a motley of my heart  Perhaps he knows more than you know  These lines begin the third part of the book entitled for reasons not very comprehensible Grotesques perhaps because it is the unfortunate custom of our country to introduce with  a deprecatory gesture all verse not literal as well as all verse not solemn Now I am going to be humorous I know it is very queer in me I say unforunate because I believe the custom arises from the sad need of deferring to a wretched morbid not to say snobbish wish on the part of hordes of American readers to like verse not because of its humor music wit truth keenness ardor generosity nor for any other positive and attractive intrinsic quality on  earth but simply for its importance  W e love pretentiousness W e are too self important and too pre occupied with our own position as admirers of the  largest assumptions in poetry to perceive that there is more fire from the blue urn of day poured into the harmonious ironies of Heine or Théophile Gautier s melodic grace in presenting the aloe tree or Bunner s pitcher of mignonette on the tenement s highest casement than in all the swelling periods of Stephen Phillips Paolo and Francesca and that the freshness of these more quiet and directly realized creations will be fragrant to the readers perception long after   Reviews  this important poem has gone where Byron s Doge of  Venice and Bailey s Festus are To the present reviewer the most vital poems in Mr Ficke s book are those not featured by an initial position nor  noticed in the title or announcements Excellent as the two first poems are they have rather the character of interesting achievement than of the truth thy mother bore thee born  to utter  Of a more vivid musical presence are several shorter poems most of them familiar to the readers of POETRY  three brief love poems The Three Sisters To a Child and Fathers and Sons also The Gentle Reader and A Cricket among the Grotesques First of all in its presentation of a striking individual endowment of the author s is the Swinburne elegy This poem does indeed say the truth thy  mother bore thee born to utter In its expression of sympathy for the poetry of the world it has the flying scope the forthright and singing candor of a unique power  Sympathy for the poetry of the world the charm pours through the elegy s imaginative admiration with a movement whose distinction none but those deaf to the speaking notes  the interval and echo of a musical page can fail to hear We the readers of America especially need a sympathy for the poetry of the world W e especially need the tonic  ability to take a long leap into the whole hearted expression of truth to plunge  soul forward head long in a book Impassioned for its beauty and salt of truth   The Swinburne elegy is of peculiar value to us belittled as we are by the ugliest fault of democracy its disparagement of distinction its dislike of unusual gifts of large forces other than the large forces which are known to us all as the sharers of a mysterious mortal destiny This jealousy of genius is democracy s meanest error We may see it not only nor even chiefly in the thread bare instances of the public neglect of Whitman and Poe What is more serious is the narrow jealousy of genius which has led so many able American writers to pride themselves on their ignorance of all methods of expression other than their own One wearies of all these clique methodisms and pharisaisms in our country  I am master of this college What I don t know isn t knowledge This is too often the attitude of our contemporary poets to poetry grown outside the island of their own manner In Mr Ficke s work we find another spirit From this point of view poetry and criticism may both be congratulated on receiving a distinguished contribution in his gift of creative force in admiration Edith Wyatt  CHAP BOOKS AND BROADSHEETS  The Old Ships by James Elroy Flecker Spring Morning by Frances Cornford The Contemplative Quarry by Anna Wickham Songs by Edward Shanks The Poetry Bookshop London A Broadside produced by Jack B Yeats The Cuala Press Dundrum Dublin   Reviews  Verse by new poets should always come to us in the way that Mr Harold Monro and those associated with him choose to send it out from the Poetry Bookshop in books small in bulk and small in price a shilling or sixpence and with a format that barely shows the machinery of production This way is the right way young writers eager about poetry with some praiseworthy verse accomplished should not be compelled to wait until they have bulk enough for stiff covers and firm binding The three writers who have still their names to make have been given the advantage of appearing in an unpretentious and attractive way  James Elroy Flecker is not one of the poets for whom unpretentious covers are demanded The Bridge of Fire Forty two Poems The Golden Journey to Samarkand contained some of the best poetry written by the younger English poets His fame was secure when he died alas in January at the age of thirty His Ballad of Iskander was an astonishing poem for a man in the twenties to have written It printed itself on my mind when I read it five years ago With his definiteness with his sure accomplishment Flecker was very much a French poet a Parnassian The movement towards free rhythms did not affect him at all If one wanted to show that to create a sense of unloosed life it is not necessary to break up poetic forms nay that it is wiser to use the most restrained forms one might give his translation of Albert Samain s poem about the dancing girl  The revel pauses and the room is still The silver flute invites her with a trill   And buried in her great veils fold on fold Rises to dance Pannyra Heel of Gold Her light steps cross her subtle arm impels The clinging drapery it bursts and swells Hollows and floats and bursts into a whirl She is a flower a moth a flaming girl All lips are silent eyes are all in trance She slowly wakes the madness of the dance Windly and wild the golden torches burn She turns and swifter yet she tries to turn Then stops A sudden marble stiff she stands The veil that round her coiled its spiral bands Checked in its course brings all its folds to rest And clinging to bright limb and pointed breast Shows as beneath silk waters woven fine Pannyra naked in a flash divine  Many of his contemporaries would have been induced to express this abandonment by metrical irregularity  These last poems are worthy of the fine and brave poet that James Elroy Flecker was His poem on the war Burial  in England is splendid in its lift above vulgar appeal  Our foes the hardest men a state can forge An army wrenched and hammered like a blade Toledo wrought neither to break nor bend Dipped in that ice the pedantry of power And toughened with wry gospels of dismay Such are these who brake down the door of France Wolves worrying at the old World s honor Hunting Peace not to prison but her tomb  It is a foe s but a generous foe s judgment His appeal to his own countrymen is generous too  But young men you who loiter in the town Need you he roused with overshouted words Country Empire Honor Liège Louvain Pay your own youth the duty of her dreams   Reviews  And it is good to know that this poet dying at thirty in the miserable days of war was able to write  Broader than Earth Love stands eclipsing nations with his wings While Pain his shadow delves as black and deep As he e er flamed or flew  Frances Cornford s verse has been known in Cambridge England circles these few years The poems in Spring Morning are really songs of innocence simple happy unintentional verses about a dog a walk a child s dream a wasted day about dawn morning and evening The woodcuts in the booklet are quaint and old fashioned and quite in the spirit of these childishly serious poems This is a sheaf of verses that will make a pleasant accompaniment for one s daily thoughts  The Contemplative Quarry is in the opposite spirit Here is woman claiming experiences for herself songs for herself The intention of the writer has put her emotions awry and her songs are hard and twisted The quarry is woman the object of her continuous contemplation is man the pursuer The booklet is provocative and it has a suggestion that the writer will rise out of a world that causes her a little amusement and much exasperation  If I had peace to sit and sing  Then I could make a lovely thing  But I am stung with goads and whips  So I build songs like iron ships  Let it be something for my song  If it is sometimes swift and strong   Miss Wickham s verses might be answers to belated advances in Songs by Edward Shanks Mr Shanks does not know he is belated and he writes with assurance of meadows and maids that may be clipped and kissed therein His songs show good accomplishment although they are all kept on the youthful erotical plane He has listened eagerly to the old English songs and ballads and he has the wood pigeon notes they have when they speak of a love that is not tragical But why should he have re written The Maid s Wager These songs are eager and have a feeling for meadows and sunlight and summer days  New verse is sometimes printed in The Broadside that Jack B Yeats produces monthly but he gives more often specimens of the old anonymous songs that are still sung on the roads and in the streets in Ireland His Broadside is a two leaved pamphlet hand printed with three pictures one of them colored It is the pictures by Jack B Yeats that make it valuable The

personal art Padraic Colum   Reviews  Poems by E Scotton Huelin Sounds From Another Valley  by H F Sampson The Song of the Five by Cecil  Garth Elkin Mathews  I have before me three books They are what the reviewers call little books meaning anything which does not cost five shillings In this case they are all good and none is distinguished True none of them treats of the war but on the other hand none of them is as interesting as Edgar Master s last book none has the tang of J S Eliot s newest work or of that of Orrick Johns at his best  In no case do I wish to offer the young writers advice The reviewer does as a matter of course usually start to offer advice If you see a man like Johns who hits the bulls eye about one time in six but hits it you of necessity want to offer advice If a new presumably youngish poet convinces you of his personality his impulse and constantly mars his effects by flaws of surface by gaucherie there is a certain kind of purely technical advice which can be offered by someone longer in the lists and which may even be accepted and do no harm or very little harm or even some good The gist of it is to make the young writer more constantly aware more vividly aware of his medium I think such advice can scarcely ever be given to advantage save by someone who believes in or admires the work which he is striving to correct or guide forward  That aside I have before me three books each in a different fashion   Mr E Scotton Huelin is up to date he might have been reading Tagore and the imagists He writes mostly vers libre  Mr H F Sampson might have been reading Swinburne and the nineties  Mr Cecil Garth might have been reading Browning  All of these men are poetic they all have a right to sing Mr Huelin is pictorial and somewhat pale in emotion he will drag in his little self of yesterday I suppose he is the new poet of the season the new poet of the season And Mr Sampson is vigorous And Mr Garth oh well I like Mr Garth but I can t admit that he has yet learned to write  And I sit here in the sun feeling that I am doing these poets an injury in not getting up an enthusiasm They are I believe the pick of the season I am in each case convinced of the sincerity of the poetic nature of the writer and there I suppose is an end of it You can t call them writers of promise they simply don t promise In the case of Eliot of Johns one can take a reasonable chance on the future E P   OUR CONTEMPORARIES  OUR FRIEND THE ENEMY  The Dial according to precedent casts the obloquy of its disapproval upon the rare and unusual book that has in it the springs of life This time it is Mr Masters Spoon River Anthology Mr Raymond M Alden objects to its deliberate unloveliness Spoon River he thinks must be a place peculiarly accursed since it furnishes such an extraordinary study in mortuary statistics As a proof of this he recounts the cruel and unusual means by which the people in the first half of the Anthology met their death Well not all people come to a natural death whatever that may mean Perhaps if Mr Alden would stop to count up he might be as appalled as I was on making this test to realize how many friends and acquaintances have not died the peaceful death of old age  But the spell of romanticism is still as potent upon death as upon life We may measure the critic not only by what he condemns but by what he praises Mr Alden turns from Mr Masters deliberate unloveliness to the wordy artifice with which Mr Thomas Hardy glosses the sinking of the Titanic  And as the smart ship grew  In stature grace and hue  In shadowy silence grew the Iceberg too  Alien they seem to be  No mortal eye could see  The intimate welding of their later history   Or sign that they were bent By paths coincident On being anon twin halves of one august event  Till the Spinner of the Years Said Now And each one hears And consummation comes and jars two hemispheres  With all Mr Hardy s poems to chose from many of them by the way very much akin to Mr Masters poems in spirit the bitterly ironic spirit which expresses while it masks a passionate idealism this selection is certainly enough to jar two hemispheres  Much might be said of this type of criticism but what is the use People will continue to read it under the conviction that only the dull is sound and that only those critics who uphold the old at the expense of the new although half their effort is given to proving that the new is very old are the real conservators of human progress  Naturally the Imagists come in for their share of condemnation Mr Alden says  Even if we have serious suspicions as to the probable value of these experiments we should try to understand them and for this reason it is a cause for satisfaction that there should be initiated a New Poetry Series designed to represent the work of the latest generation in small well printed volumes modestly priced  Here we have the customary pat for the publishers whose work is so much more important than that of the poets they print Mr Alden does not follow his own advice he does not really try to understand the work of the Imagists And   Our Friend the Enemy  for the better understanding of the public he presents what he considers to be the blemishes  Is Mr Alden s criticism of a type to guide or instruct in any way the professional craft of poets I do not think so Its tendency is simply to discourage the public No art  gallery and an art gallery serves the best function of criticism strives to collect only the worst examples of a painter s art  The Dial is one of the few journals in America devoted exclusively to the interests of literature It is a sad commentary on the present state of criticism that it should be  recorded of The Dial as by Mr Owen Wister in The Atlantic that it recognizes merit only after the fact For the initial recognition genius must look to other tribunals  A C H  WHITMAN AMENDED  We are indebted to the New York Call for the following  editorial  DOWN WITH FREEDOM  Being an attempt to aid F P A Don Marquis Berton Braley the Poetry Society of America and others too humorous to mention in their favorite pastime Suppressing Free Verse  How can we best help the good cause  We shall not as in their custom prove the infinite superiority of the regular forms by turning To Be or Not to be or I didn t Raise my Boy to be a Soldier into vers libre polyrhythmics or any other Whitmaniacal curosity There is a better way By rewriting Whitman Oppenheim and the rest as poetry a clear case will be made against these modern irrationalities   For instance Whitman in a misguided moment rough hews this fragment  Smile O voluptuous cool breath d earth Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river Far sweeping elbow d earth rich apple blossom d earth Smile for your lover comes  On being turned into poetry this would appear  Lusty cool breath d earth keep smiling With your sleeping liquid trees With your shine and dark beguiling Rivers yes and trees Down the elbowed heavens piling Gay with apples and with plums All a blossom keep a smiling For your lover comes  That s the stuff eh Real poetry The singing line the lyric lilt and all that Here s another prosy series of jottings by Whitman  I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the  stars And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven And a cow crunching with depressed head surpasses any statute And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels  Longfellow or Cale Young Rice would have plucked from the lyre some such dulcet strains as these  To me each leaf of grass that grows Is mighty as a ranging star Each running blackberry that blows Would shine in heaven halls afar The browsing cow within the vale A statute easily excels While any mouse the cheeks would pale Of sixty trillion infidels  That ought to convince all doubters   CORRESPONDENCE  TWO POEMS BY RILKE  Dear Editor In the article on Modern German Poetry by Mr Reginald H Wilensky in the February number of  POETRY the author gave considerable space to the profound and delicate Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke Among the examples of Rilke s poetry quoted was Die Erblindende which I had never seen before and was immediately tempted to translate into English Believing that it may possibly interest the readers of POETRY I am sending you this trans  lation together with one of another poem by Rilke Menschen bei Nacht Margarete Munsterberg  GROWING BLIND  She sat like all the rest of us at tea It seemed at first as if she raised her cup Not quite as all the others held theirs up She smiled her smile was pitiful to see  And when we rose at last with talk and laughter And through the many rooms with idle pace As chance would have it strolled from place to place Then I saw her She slowly followed after  Restrained like one who must be calm and cool Because she soon will sing before a crowd Upon her happy eyes without a cloud The light fell from outside as on a pool  She followed slowly hesitating shy As if some height or bridge must still be passed And yet as if when that was done at last She would no longer walk her way but fly PEOPLE AT NIGHT  Nights were not made for the crowds and they sever You from your neighbor so you shall never Seek him defiantly at night But if you make your dark house light To look on strangers in your room You must reflect on whom  False lights that on men s faces play Distort them gruesomely You look upon a disarray A world that seems to reel and sway A waving glittering sea On their foreheads gleams a yellow shine Where thoughts are chased away Their glances flicker mad from wine And to the words they say Strange heavy gestures make reply That struggle in the buzzing room And they say always I and I And mean they know not whom  POETRY AND THE PANAMA PACIFIC EXPOSITION  Dear POETRY Do you remember how when the pinch of war began to be felt in Europe letters poured in upon you from the poets there They contained one cry Pro  tect the arts T o you in America falls the task of keeping the flame alight for we are ruined  The Panama Pacific Exposition in San Francisco had an unusually favorable chance to respond to the cry of the artists of stricken Europe But whatever it may have done for the  other arts it has done practically nothing for the poets Aside from the fact that Mr Markham is to write an offi   Poetry and the Panama Pacific Exposition  cial poem there is no recognition whatever of the fact that poetry exists It is true that as an architectural decoration of the archways certain quotations from Confucius and Walt Whitman are used and to these the directors point triumphantly It is significant in this connection that no commercial exhibit is accepted which was in existence at the time of the St Louis exposition  Is it not time that poetry should stand squarely on her rights as a living art with a living message and demand recognition alongside of painting and sculpture Doubtless practical difficulties would present themselves in the matter of the choice of a jury and the method of setting before the public the poems selected But these difficulties would be no greater than in the case of painting And to the many distinguished visitors to the Exposition not only from Europe but also from the newly awakened Orient which is gravely examining our western culture the lack of any recognition of one of the oldest and most reverenced of the arts cannot but seem significant It will be difficult to explain to them that the official oblivion on the subject comes not from the lack of excellent material to be exhibited but from lack of appreciation on the part of a local board of directors The Panama Pacific Exposition has lost an excellent chance It remains for some future Exposition perhaps the one contemplated in Japan to be the first to house the lyric muse  Eunice Tietjens  Mrs Tietjens very reasonable suggestion is being discussed with some asperity along the Coast where the paragraphers have had their usual profoundly humorous time with it Mr Samuel Travers Clover recently answered some of their objections in his Los Angeles weekly The Graphic of which Mrs Tietjens since her much regretted departure from the POETRY office has become poetry editor We quote a part of his editorial  Mrs Tietjens argument that poetry is a fine art and in its present renascence a distinct feature of the cultural progress of our country ergo worthy of representation at a national exposition strikes us as a sound postulate Surely she contends largely considered poetry is of as much ultimate value as poultry which occupies more than an acre of space As to the manner of exhibiting verse her suggestion is that a jury of contemporary poets reinforced by a professor of literature from one of the universities and perhaps an editor would be fully as competent to judge the volumes submitted as are contemporary painters to judge the canvases The volumes accepted could be ranged in book shelves in a quiet room where the public could browse at will Then she adds since the music of the spoken word is half the magic periodical readings could be given either by visiting poets or by someone competent to read their works  There is nothing bizarre or impractical in her suggestion we submit The plan of inviting our modern poets to a congress offers great attraction With Percy Mackaye Vachel Lindsay the Gospel of Beauty protagonist Edgar L Masters of the Spoon River Anthology fame Edwin L Markham George Sterling our own John McGroarty Harriet Monroe Eunice Tietjens and a score of other living poets of acknowledged merit in attendance a successful gathering were assured Then too Alfred Noyes might be lured to the coast and perhaps John Masefeld and Stephen Phillips Popular We venture to say the poets section at the Panama Pacific Exposition would be a loadstone of cultural traffic and repay all expense to the management a hundredfold  Desertion  DESERTION  Rhyme supposing that all the poets leave you  Where will you go to hide yourself away  Is there no place where honorable Rhyme may stay No far elysium where Poetry will receive you Where do her veterans dwell the outworn and gray  Oh many a long century you have lived content  In paired delights or dancing sisterly dances  Sounds beckoning to sounds like lovers mutual glances Sounds wedded with sounds and shades of sounds well blent Poetry what new devices will enhance your beauty As Rhyme old Rhyme enhances  Helen Hoyt NOTES  Mr Wilfrid Wilson Gibson of Greenway Ledbury England is well known as the author of plays in verse and of other poems of English

most from him if he remains himself So we think Mr Pound has chosen the right method in these translations and we do not mind that they often are not English The words are English and give us the sense and after all it is the business of a writer to mould language to new purposes not to say something new just as his forefathers said something old So it is the business of the reader not to be angry or surprised at a strange use of language if it is a use proper to the sense  Chinese poetry has a wonderful humanity like Chinese painting and it is very free from artistic nonsense The Chinese poet at least in the great age of Tang did not sit down to write poetry and lose his common sense in the process He wrote to say something that was worth saying and even in translation he interests us
