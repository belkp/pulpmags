The Seven Arts 2.3 (1917-07) , made THE SEVEN ARTS THE SHADOW IN THE WHITE HOUSE By James Oppenheim JULY, 1917 NOTES ON NAMES. Randolph Bourne has since his graduation from Columbia achieved an enviable place as an interpreter of social conditions. His essays are on educational, political and cultural subjects. Charles L. Buchanan is well-known as a writer on music. Benjamin De Casseres is an American poet of remarkable individuality. His work is probably more widely read abroad than here. Much of it has been translated into French. Perhaps his most interesting volume is "The Shadow Eater."  Mr. De Casseres is a collateral descendant of Spinoza. Elva DePue hails from San Francisco. She came to New York this season in order to write and study at Columbia. One of her dramas was recently produced by the Morningside Players. John Dewey, professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, is the leading figure today in American thought. Among his important works are "School and Society," "Democracy and Education," "German Philosophy and Politics." Theodore Dreiser, whose books "The Titan," "Sister Carrie," etc., have placed him in the front of American novelists, is also a master of the short dramatic form, as his "Plays, Natural and Supernatural" attest. Wallace Gould is a resident of Lewiston, Maine, where, for the last eighteen years, he has played piano for a living. He is an unpublished poet and an authentic addition to the American Parnassus. Marsden Hartley is one of the most prominent of the radical American painters.   He has lived long abroad.   His critical work is familiar to our eaders. D. H. Lawrence stands in the forefront of young English writers. Although well-known as a poet, his novel "Sons and Lovers" and such sketches as "The Prussian Officer" are his most genuine literary contributions. Kenneth Macgowan is an able student of the motion-picture. He has had a varied career as dramatic critic on such papers as The Boston Transcript and The Philadelphia Ledger. Several of his analyses of the cinema have appeared in The Seven Arts. Hiram K. Moderwell, since his graduation from Harvard, has allied himself closely with American music and the American stage. He has published a book on the contemporary theater and is a regular correspondent of The Boston Transcript. William Murrell is the nom de plume of a young art-critic who holds a position with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Paul Strand is a young American photographer whose work has commanded the particular praise of such an authority as Alfred Steiglitz. Eunice Tietjens is associate editor of Poetry, a Magazine of Verse published in Chicago. She has traveled widely and her "Profiles from China" are one consequence of her knowledge of the Orient. bound copies of the SEVEN ARTS Bound copies of Volume One of The Seven Arts may now be obtained at a moderate cost.

YOST 643 pages, probable price, $1.90 net.   Ready June 28th. "Patience Worth," the invisible author whose work was described in "Patience Worth : A Psychic Mystery," has written a story of the time of Christ. It is the story of a son of Tiberius Caesar by a Greek slave, a woman of great beauty and of noble blood. After a time she is discarded and gives birth to a child outside the walls of Bethlehem, on the same night that Christ is born within the walls. The two great characters of the story, Christ and this other youth, come into contact from time to time in the tale, to meet finally on Calvary. All of the story was communicated through Mrs. John H. Curran of St. Louis, in the same manner as the other productions of this personality. Wm. Marion Reedy says in Reedy's Mirror: I have seen the complete manuscript. This is the most remarkable piece of literature I have ever read. I have no hesitation in saying that this production —I ignore any religious claims for it and I discount the adventitious interest of the manner of its presentation—is a world's literary marvel.

HENRY HOLT AND COMPANY 19 West 44th Street New York iii  The Shadow in The White House By James Oppenheim A Room in the White House, dim and large, and through the windows in the rear, the streaming light from a high moon. It is about one in the morning. The President enters in a long robe. His eyes are wide open, and yet he does not seem to be awake. THE PRESIDENT (Raising a hand high and speaking low and earnestly.) SILENCE. .  . . (He advances a few steps.) You cannot hide there.    I am wide awake, I tell you. Stand out, I say. (He stares into the dark corner at the right) Yes : I see you—you can't escape me. . . . (A tall shadowy form stands out indistinctly from the corner.) So. . . . (There is silence.) (The President passes a hand over his eyes and stares again.) Who are you? THE SHADOW (In a deep voice.) I am the answer. . . . THE PRESIDENT The answer? The answer to what? THE SHADOW To you . . . you are the question. . . . [263]  The Shadow in The White House THE PRESIDENT I can't understand. ... I thought he was the answer. . . . Perhaps if I put on an old stovepipe hat, perhaps if I wore a shawl, perhaps if I grew a beard around the edge of my face.. . . THE SHADOW (Laughing softly.) What then? THE PRESIDENT I, too, might be the answer. . . . THE SHADOW (Advancing and speaking in a fatherly kindly voice.) Sit down, Woodrow Wilson.   Let's just forget the dead Presidents in this room. (The Shadow seats himself, crossng his legs. He is now more distinct, a great shawl around his stooping shoulders, a stovepipe hat on his lap.) (The President hesitates, then sits opposite the Shadow.) THE SHADOW (Drawling.) It's a hard job, isn't it, trying to be a real American? THE PRESIDENT (Laughing, without mirth.) I suppose so. THE SHADOW And yet it mightn't be so hard a job after all. THE PRESIDENT How? THE SHADOW Well, for instance, if you didn't try at all. You see you are an American. If you were just Woodrow Wilson, instead of trying to be Abe Lincoln. . . . [264]  James Oppenheim THE PRESIDENT But Lincoln was our noblest and truest American. . . . THE SHADOW He didn't try to be, Woodrow. He was plenty busy being himself. He didn't try, for instance, to be George Washington. THE PRESIDENT He tried surely to carry out the great principles of democracy laid down by the Fathers. . . . THE SHADOW Well, yes. But only so far as it came natural to him. You see he was interested in democracy because he had a hankering after average folk, and babies, and young fellows. He used to sit in the grocery store and enjoy killing time with the boys. In fact, when it came to being President, he couldn't be half as dignified and correct and polished as he should have liked. He made an awful impression on the . . . the high-brows, you call 'em . . . and on the foreigners. And it cut him to the quick. He'd have given much to be like you. That is, so far as manners go. THE PRESIDENT And yet I must be like him! I must make safe for the world "government of the people, by the people, and for the people." THE SHADOW Well, how's that to be done? THE PRESIDENT By crushing autocracy, as Lincoln crushed the South. THE SHADOW What do the people say about it? THE PRESIDENT It's amazing. There seems to be so much apathy and ques- [265]  The Shadow in The White House tioning . . . they haven't come forward in good style at all. . . . If I could only make them understand. . . . THE SHADOW Perhaps they do understand. THE PRESIDENT No.   They can't see the vast international intricacies, the problems of statesmanship. . . . THE SHADOW Well, I was never much of a hand at understanding such things myself. But perhaps they understand some other things. . . . THE PRESIDENT What sort of things? THE SHADOW Perhaps they understand that democracy begins at home. Perhaps they understand that America isn't Europe—seeing that they came to America because they couldn't stand Europe —and perhaps they think it is risky business to meddle in the councils of kings and courtiers, and perhaps we aren't sharp enough to get through with it. Besides that, perhaps they think we could work for peace, and really do something. THE PRESIDENT I hate war myself: I even hate to read the newspaper accounts of battles: and I worked hard for peace.   But I was convinced in spite of myself. . . . THE SHADOW That was the moment when you should have trusted yourself least. And that was the moment when you could have tried out democracy—just tried, for a change, government of the people, by the people, and for the people. THE PRESIDENT How could I have done that? [266]  James Oppenheim THE SHADOW By asking the people what they wanted. Give them a vote on it. THE PRESIDENT But that has never been done.  Not even Lincoln did that. THE SHADOW You see, that's what comes of trying to be Lincoln, or Jefferson, or Moses, instead of trying out your own Wilsonhood. Woodrow, you could have done for democracy more than Lincoln did when he freed the slaves. You could have struck terror into every kingdom of the Earth by saying, a free people shall declare its own wars. How that would have set the soldiers and workers in Europe thinking! It would have put in the shade the Russian Revolution! Think of it . . . the democracy of America can be trusted to decide for itself whether it shall be shipped to Europe to kill and be killed. You see, Woodrow, you don't really believe in the people, do you? THE PRESIDENT If I don't, Lincoln didn't.   He was autocrat enough. THE SHADOW (Laughing.) In spots. But when you're inside a house on fire you don't stand on ceremony. I can't see that this country is burning up.  It looks peaceful and quiet, and no damage done. THE PRESIDENT He declared war as I did. THE SHADOW Not the same. He was elected to declare war if the South seceded: you, as I understand it, were elected to keep America out of the war. Besides, the issue was different—the country was split in two, and our enemies were inside our own borders.   It was a case of life and death. [267] The Shadow in The White House THE PRESIDENT So is this a case of life and death. ... If the country understood it. . . . THE SHADOW Well, all I know is, that if democracy can't save itself, no one on God's Earth can save it—not even Woodrow Wilson. (A silence. The Shadow rises, and then the President. The Shadow looms over the President impressively and solemnly.) THE SHADOW Woodrow Wilson, I suffered in this house, and in this room too. I lived here for nearly five years, while the battle raged across the country. I saw the boys in the hospitals and knew I was a failure compared with the worst of them. I had the mothers come in to see me, and I knew who was bearing the brunt of the war. I lived through something that was black and cruel, and made my heart a lamentation. And I learned that it wasn't I who understood, nor even the people who understood. None of us were anything unless we listened to what lay deepest in us all. But if it had to come between deciding what the people wanted and what I wanted, I made way for the people. For this country is theirs, and this government is their government, and the power that I had, and that you have, is their power. If the people want to ruin themselves they have a perfect right to do so: and if the people want to be unwise, they can't be stopped. But I have a feeling that that's the sort of Earth we may expect to come— whether it's good or bad, wise or foolish. At least, you who know something of history, know that the Earth under other governments was both bad and foolish. (Silence.) You have wrought faithfully. You have been very patient. You have tried hard to believe in democracy. You have done much.   Perhaps what you need most is to learn how to joke [268] James Oppenheim and how to be a joke. The man you admire so much was the greatest joke of his time. You might imitate that, and then perhaps you could trust a little more to democracy and be a democrat—even if it meant changing your mind and your manners, too. . . . (Silence.) At any rate, don't feel that America is on your shoulders. It isn't on any one man's shoulders. The power that is in it is something greater than any one man or group of men. (Silence.) Woodrow, I know what you are facing. Few living men have a harder or greater task. May God—and the common people—be with you! (The Shadow withdraws.) THE PRESIDENT The common people? (He starts after the Shadow.) Abraham Lincoln! [269] Below the Battle By Randolph Bourne HE is one of those young men who, because his parents happened to mate during a certain ten years of the world's history, has had now to put his name on a wheel of fate, thereby submitting himself to be drawn into a brief sharp course of military training before being shipped across the sea to kill Germans or be killed by them. He does not like this fate that menaces him, and he dislikes it because he seems to find nothing in the programme marked out for him which touches remotely his aspirations, his impulses, or even his desires. My friend is not a happy young man, but even the unsatisfactory life he is living seems supplemented at no single point by the life of the drill-ground or the camp or the stinking trench. He visualizes the obscenity of the battlefield and turns away in nausea. He thinks of the weary regimentation of young men, and is filled with disgust. His mind has turned sour on war and all that it involves. He is poor material for the military proclamation and the drill-sergeant. I want to understand this friend of mine, for he seems rather typical of a scattered race of young Americans of today. He does not fall easily into the categories of patriot and coward which the papers are making popular. He feels neither patriotism nor fear, only an apathy toward the war, faintly warmed into a smouldering resentment at the men who have clamped down the war-pattern upon him and that vague mass of people and ideas and workaday living around him that he thinks of as his country. Now that resentment has knotted itself into a tortured tangle of what he should do, how [270] Randolph Bourne he can best be true to his creative self? I should say that his apathy cannot be imputed to cowardly ease. My friend earns about fifteen hundred dollars a year as an architect's assistant, and he lives alone in a little room over a fruitshop. He worked his way through college, and he has never known even a leisurely month. There is nothing Phæacian about his life. It is scarcely to save his skin for riotous living that he is reluctant about war. Since he left college he has been trying to find his world. He is often seriously depressed and irritated with himself for not having hewed out a more glorious career for himself. His work is just interesting enough to save it from drudgery, and yet not nearly independent and exacting enough to give him a confident professional sense. Outside his work, life is deprived and limited rather than luxurious. He is fond of music and goes to cheap concerts. He likes radical meetings, but never could get in touch with the agitators. His friends are seeking souls just like himself. He likes midnight talks in cafés and studios, but he is not especially amenable to drink. His heart of course is hungry and turbid, but his two or three love-affairs have not clarified anything for him. He eats three rather poor restaurant meals a day. When he reads, it is philosophy—Nietzsche, James, Bergson—or the novels about youth—Rolland, Nexö, Cannan, Frenssen, Beres-ford. He has a rather constant mood of futility, though he is in unimpeachable health. There are moments when life seems quite without sense or purpose. He has enough friends, however, to be not quite lonely, and yet they are so various as to leave him always with an ache for some more cohesive, purposeful circle. His contacts with people irritate him without rendering him quite unhopeful. He is always expecting he doesn't know quite what, and always being frustrated of he doesn't quite know what would have pleased him. Perhaps he never had a moment of real external or internal ease in his life. Obviously a creature of low vitality, with neither the broad [271] Below the Battle vision to be stirred by the President's war message, nor the red blood to itch for the dummy bayonet-charge. Yet somehow he does not seem exactly weak, and there is a consistency about his attitude which intrigues me. Since he left college eight years ago, he has been through most of the intellectual and emotional fads of the day. He has always cursed himself for being so superficial and unrooted, and he has tried to write a little of the thoughts that stirred him. What he got down on paper was, of course, the usual large vague feeling of a new time that all of us feel. With the outbreak of the Great War, most of his socialist and pacifist theories were knocked flat. The world turned out to be an entirely different place from what he had thought it. Progress and uplift seemed to be indefinitely suspended, though it was a long time before he realized how much he had been corroded by the impact of news and the endless discussions he heard. I think he gradually worked himself into a truly neutral indifference. The reputable people and the comfortable classes who were having all the conventional emotions rather disgusted him. The neurotic fury about self-defence seemed to come from types and classes that he instinctively detested. He was not scared, and somehow he could not get enthusiastic about defending himself with "preparedness" unless he were badly scared. Things got worse. All that he valued seemed frozen until the horrible mess came to a close. He had gone to an unusually intelligent American college, and he had gotten a feeling for a humane civilization that had not left him. The war, it is true, bit away piece by piece every ideal that made this feeling seem plausible. Most of the big men—intellectuals—whom he thought he respected had had so much of their idealism hacked away and got their nerves so frayed that they became at last, in their panic, willing and even eager to adopt the war-technique in aid of their government's notions of the way to impose democracy on the world. My poor young friend can best be understood as too naive [272] Randolph Bourne and too young to effect this metamorphosis. Older men might mix a marvellous intellectual brew of personal anger, fear, a sense of "dishonor," fervor for a League of Peace, and set going a machinery that crushed everything intelligent, humane and civilized. My friend was less flexible. War simply did not mix with anything that he had learned to feel was desirable. Something in his mind spewed it out whenever it was suggested as a cure for our grievous American neutrality. As I got all this from our talks, he did not seem weak. He merely had no notion of the patriotism that meant the springing of a nation to arms. He read conscientiously The New Republics feast of eloquent idealism, with its appealing harbingers of a cosmically efficacious and well-bred war. He would often say, This is all perfectly convincing; why, then, are we not all convinced? He seemed to understand the argument for American participation. We both stood in awe at the superb intellectual structure that was built up. But my friend is one of those unfortunate youths whose heart has to apprehend as well as his intellect, and it was his heart that inexorably balked. So he was in no mood to feel the worth of American participation, in spite of the infinite tact and Fabian strategy of the Executive and his intellectualist backers. He felt apart from it all. He had not the imagination to see a healed world-order built out of the rotten materials of armaments, diplomacy and "liberal" statesmanship. And he wasn't affected by the psychic complex of panic, hatred, rage, class-arrogance and patriotic swagger that was creating in newspaper editors and in the ' jeunesse dorée" around us the authentic élan for war. My friend is thus somehow in the nation but not of the nation. The war has as yet got no conceivable clutch on his soul. He knows that theoretically he is united with a hundred million in purpose, sentiment and deed for an idealistic war to defend democracy and civilization against predatory autocracy. Yet somehow, in spite of all the excitement, nobody has as yet been able to make this real to him.   He is healthy, [273] Below the Battle intelligent, idealistic. The irony is that the demand which his country now makes on him is one to which not one single cell or nerve of idealism or desire responds. The cheap and silly blare of martial life leaves him cold. The easy inflation of their will-to-power which is coming to so many people from their participation in volunteer or government service, or, better still, from their urging others to farm, enlist, invest, retrench, organize,—none of this allures him. His life is uninteresting and unadventurous, but it is not quite dull enough to make this activity or anything he knows about war seem a release into lustier expression. He has ideals but he cannot see their realization through a desperate struggle to the uttermost. He doubts the "saving" of an America which can only be achieved through world-suicide. He wants democracy, but he does not want the kind of democracy we will get by this war enough to pay the suicidal cost of getting it in the way we set about it. Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori, sweet and becoming is it to die for one's country. This is the young man who is suddenly asked to die for his country. My friend was much concerned about registration. He felt coercive forces closing in upon him. He did not want to register for the purposes of being liable to conscription. It would be doing something positive when he felt only apathy. Furthermore, if he was to resist, was it not better to take a stand now than to wait to be drafted? On the other hand, was it not too much of a concession to rebel at a formality? He did not really wish to be a martyr. Going to prison for a year for merely refusing to register was rather a grotesque and futile gesture. He did not see himself as a hero, shedding inspiration by his example to his fellows. He did not care what others did. His objection to prison was not so much fear perhaps as contempt for a silly sacrifice. He could not keep up his pose of complete aliency from the war-enterprise, now that registration was upon him. Better submit stoically, he thought, to the physical pressure, [274] Randolph Bourne mentally reserving his sense of spiritual aliency from the enterprise into which he was being remorselessly moulded. Yet my friend is no arrant prig. He does not pretend to be a "world-patriot," or a servant of some higher law than his country's. Nor does he feel blatantly patriotic. With his groping philosophy of life, patriotism has merely died as a concept of significance for him. It is to him merely the emotion that fills the herd when it imagines itself engaged in massed defence or massed attack. Having no such images, he has no feeling of patriotism. He still feels himself inextricably a part of this blundering, wistful, crass civilization we call America. All he asks is not to be identified with it for warlike ends. He does not feel pro-German. He tells me there is not a drop of any but British blood in his veins. He does not love the Kaiser. He is quite willing to believe that it is the German government and not the German people whom he is asked to fight, although it may be the latter whom he is obliged to kill. But he cannot forget that it is the American government rather than the American people who got up the animus to fight the German government. He does not forget that the American government, having through tragic failure slipped into the war-technique, is now trying to manipulate him into that war-technique. And my friend's idea of patria does not include the duty of warlike animus, even when the government decides such animus is necessary to carry out its theories of democracy and the future organization of the world. There are ways in which my friend would probably be willing to die for his country. If his death now meant the restoration of those ravaged lands and the bringing back of the dead, that would be a cause to die for. But he knows that dead cannot be brought back or the brotherly currents restored. The work of madness will not be undone. Only a desperate war will be prolonged. Everything seems to him so mad that there is nothing left worth dying for. Pro partria mori, to my friend, means something different [275] Below the Battle from lying gaunt as a conscript on a foreign battlefield, fallen in the last desperate fling of an interminable world-war. Does this mean that if he is drafted he will refuse to serve? I do not know. It will not be any plea of "conscientious objection" that keeps him back. That phrase to him has already an archaic flavor which implies a ruling norm, a stiff familiar whom he must obey in the matter. It implies that one would be delighted to work up one's blood-lust for the business, except that this unaccountable conscience, like a godly grandmother, absolutely forbids. In the case of my friend, it will not be any objective "conscience." It will be something that is woven into his whole modern philosophic feel for life. This is what paralyzes him against taking one step toward the war-machine. If he were merely afraid of death, he would seek some alternative service. But he does not. He remains passive and apathetic, waiting for the knife to fall. There is a growing cynicism in him about the brisk and inept bustle of war-organization. His attitude suggests that if he is worked into war-service, he will have to be coerced every step of the way. Yet he may not even rebel. He may go silently into the ranks in a mood of cold contempt. His horror of useless sacrifice may make even the bludgeoning of himself seem futile. He may go in the mood of so many young men in the other countries, without enthusiasm, without idealism, without hope and without belief, victims of a tragically blind force behind them. No other government, however, has had to face from the very start quite this appalling skepticism of youth. My friend is significant because all the shafts of panic, patriotism and national honor have been discharged at him without avail. All the seductions of "liberal" idealism leave him cold. He is to be susceptible to nothing but the use of crude, rough, indefeasible violence. Nothing could be more awkward for a "democratic" President than to be faced with this cold, staring skepticism of youth, in the prosecution of his [276] Randolph Bourne war. The attitude of my friend suggests that there is a personal and social idealism in America which is out of reach of the most skilful and ardent appeals of the older order, an idealism that cannot be hurt by the taunts of cowardice and slacking or kindled by the slogans of capitalistic democracy. This is the cardinal fact of our war—the non-mobilization of the younger intelligentsia. What will they do to my friend? If the war goes on they will need him. Pressure will change skepticism into bitterness. That bitterness will well and grow. If the country submissively pours month after month its wealth of life and resources into the work of annihilation, that bitterness will spread out like a stain over the younger American generation. If the enterprise goes on endlessly, the work, so blithely undertaken for the defence of democracy, will have crushed out the only genuinely precious thing in a nation, the hope and ardent idealism of its youth. [277] Out of the Storm By Louis Untermeyer I TURNED and tossed and could not sleep. The earth was restless with the deep Growls of approaching thunder. Then suddenly the heavens lurched Out of their depths as lightnings searched Stabbing and splitting the skies asunder. The cannonade grew nearer, louder. There was a rushing in my ears. I heard the hoarse winds charge; the groans and cheers Of grappling armies shook me.   I smelt powder Drifting across black pools and fresh Hummocks of earth and flesh. Ominous cries were in that thunder That grew so horribly and came so close. Yet under The tumult and the shattering throes A small thing stirred; A whisper, a fragment broken and blurred; A voice that struggled beneath great blows— And then it arose: "Throw down your guns, it cried, Throw down your swords! What is this talk of hate or pride, Of captured lands or hoards? Whatever may be left, they will divide Only among our lords. [278] Louis Untermeyer "Throw down your guns and go Back to your farm or town. What madness made you seem our foe? Come, let us make our masters know That, having torn their banners down, They too shall lie as low! ''Throw down the ancient signs. Open your death-bewildered eyes and see We are already free! The sun breaks through the smoke and shines Upon our only enemy Trading—behind the lines! "Rejoice then, ye who died Unknown, unglorified; Rejoice, ye living, at last The fierce and torturing night has passed. The lights of morning stream Over a healed and liberal world. Our guns rot sweetly, side by side; The insolent flags are furled. . . ." Again the storm's black thunder rolling wide, And fresh assaults.   I saw the earth divide Beneath the lightning's pitiless gleam. "Throw down your guns." the voice had cried .  . . It was a dream. [279] The Mortal Coil By D. H. Lawrence I. SHE stood motionless in the middle of the room, something tense in her reckless bearing. Her gown of reddish stuff fell silkily about her feet; she looked tall and splendid in the candlelight. Her dark-blond hair was gathered loosely in a fold on top of her head, her young, blossom-fresh face was lifted. From her throat to her feet she was clothed in the elegantly-made dress of silky red stuff, the color of red earth. She looked complete and lovely, only love could make her such a strange, complete blossom. Her cloak and hat were thrown across a table just in front of her. Quite alone, abstracted, she stood there arrested in a conflict of emotions. Her hand, down against her skirt, worked irritably, the ball of the thumb rubbing, rubbing across the tips of the fingers. There was a slight tension between her lifted brows. About her the room glowed softly, reflecting the candlelight from its whitewashed walls, and from the great, bowed, whitewashed ceiling. It was a large attic, with two windows, and the ceiling curving down on either side, so that both the far walls were low. Against one, on one side, was a single bed, opened for the night, the white over-bolster piled back. Not far from this was the iron stove. Near the window closest to the bed was a table with writing materials, and a handsome cactus-plant with clear scarlet blossoms threw its bizarre shadow on the wall. There was another table near the second window, and opposite was the door on which hung a military [280] D. H. Lawrence cloak. Along the far wall, were guns and fishing-tackle, and some clothes too, hung on pegs—all men's clothes, all military. It was evidently the room of a man, probably a young lieutenant. The girl, in her pure red dress that fell about her feet, so that she looked a woman, not a girl, at last broke from her abstraction and went aimlessly to the writing-table. Her mouth was closed down stubbornly, perhaps in anger, perhaps in pain. She picked up a large seal made of agate, looked at the ingraven coat of arms, then stood rubbing her finger across the cut-out stone, time after time. At last she put the seal down, and looked at the other things—a beautiful old beer-mug used as a tobacco-jar, a silver box like an urn, old and of exquisite shape, a bowl of sealing wax. She fingered the pieces of wax. This, the dark-green, had sealed her last letter. Ah, well! She carelessly turned over the blotting book, which again had his arms stamped on the cover. Then she went away to the window. There, in the window-recess, she stood and looked out. She opened the casement and took a deep breath of the cold night air. Ah, it was good! Far below was the street, a vague golden milky way beneath her, its tiny black figures moving and crossing and re-crossing with marionette, insect-like intentness. A small horse-car rumbled along the lines, so belittled, it was an absurdity. So much for the world! ... he did not come. She looked overhead. The stars were white and flashing, they looked nearer than the street, more kin to her, more real. She stood pressing her breast on her arms, her face lifted to the stars, in the long, anguished suspense of waiting. Noises came up small from the street, as from some insect-world. But the great stars overhead struck white and invincible, infallible.  Her heart felt cold like the stars. At last she started. There was a noisy knocking at the door, and a female voice calling: "Anybody there?" [281] The Mortal Coil "Come in," replied the girl. She turned round, shrinking from this intrusion, unable to bear it, after the flashing stars. There entered a thin, handsome dark girl dressed in an extravagantly-made gown of dark purple silk and dark blue velvet. She was followed by a small swarthy, inconspicuous lieutenant in pale-blue uniform. "Ah you! . . . alone?" cried Teresa, the newcomer, advancing into the room.   "Where's the Fritz, then?" The girl in red raised her shoulders in a shrug, and turned her face aside, but did not speak. "Not here! You don't know where he is? Ach, the dummy, the lout!"   Teresa swung round on her companion. "Where is he?" she demanded. He also lifted his shoulders in a shrug. "He said he was coming in half an hour," the young lieutenant replied. "Ha!—half an hour! Looks like it! How long is that ago—two hours?" Again the young man only shrugged. He had beautiful black eye-lashes, and steady eyes. He stood rather depre-catingly, whilst his girl, golden like a young panther, hung over him. "One knows where he is," said Teresa, going and sitting on the opened bed. A dangerous contraction came between the brows of Marta, the girl in red, at this act. "Wine, Women and Cards!" said Teresa, in her loud voice. "But they prefer the women on the cards. " 'My love he has four Queenies, Four Queenies has my lo-o-ove.' " she sang. Then she broke off, and turned to Podewils. "Was he winning when you left him, Karl?" Again the young baron raised his shoulders. "Tant pis que mal," he replied, cryptically. "Ah, you!" cried Teresa, "with your tant pis que mal! [282] D. H. Lawrence Are you tant pis que mal?'' She laughed her deep, strange laugh. "Well," she added, "he'll be coming in with a fortune for you, Marta—" There was a vague, unhappy silence. "I know his fortunes," said Marta. "Yes," said Teresa, in sudden sober irony, "he's a horse-shoe round your neck, is that young jockey.—But what are you going to do, Matzen dearest? You're not going to wait for him any longer?—Don't dream of it! The idea, waiting for that young gentleman as if you were married to him!—Put your hat on, dearest, and come along with us . . . Where are we going, Karl, you pillar of salt?—Eh?—Geier's?—To Geier's, Marta, my dear. Come, quick, up—you've been martyred enough, Marta, my martyr—haw!—haw!!—put your hat on.  Up—away!" Teresa sprang up like an explosion, anxious to be off. "No, I'll wait for him," said Marta, sullenly. "Don't be such a fool!" cried Teresa, in her deep voice. "Wait for him! I'd give him wait for him. Catch this little bird waiting." She lifted her hand and blew a little puff across the fingers. "Choo-fly!" she sang, as if a bird had just flown. The young lieutenant stood silent with smiling dark eyes. Teresa was quick, and golden as a panther. "No, but really, Marta, you're not going to wait any more —really! It's stupid for you to play Gretchen—your eyes are much too green.   Put your hat on, there's a darling." "No," said Marta, her flower-like face strangely stubborn. "I'll wait for him.   He'll have to come some time." There was a moment's uneasy pause. "Well," said Teresa, holding her shoulders for her cloak, "so long as you don't wait as long as Lenora-fuhr-ums-Mor-genrot—! Adieu, my dear, God be with you." The young lieutenant bowed a solicitous bow, and the two went out, leaving the girl in red once more alone. [283] The Mortal Coil She went to the writing table, and on a sheet of paper began writing her name in stiff Gothic characters, time after time : Marta Hohenest Marta Hohenest Marta Hohenest. The vague sounds from the street below continued. The wind was cold.  She rose and shut the window.  Then she sat down again. At last the door opened, and a young officer entered. He was buttoned up in a dark-blue great-coat, with large silver buttons going down on either side of the breast. He entered quickly, glancing over the room, at Marta, as she sat with her back to him. She was marking with a pencil on paper. He closed the door. Then with fine beautifiul movements he divested himself of his coat and went to hang it up. How well Marta knew the sound of his movements, the quick light step! But she continued mechanically making crosses on the paper, her head bent forward between the candles, so that her hair made fine threads and mist of light, very beautiful. He saw this, and it touched him. But he could not afford to be touched any further. "You have been waiting?" he said formally. The insulting futile question! She made no sign, as if she had not heard. He was absorbed in the tragedy of himself, and hardly heeded her. He was a slim, good-looking youth, clear-cut and delicate in mould. His features now were pale, there was something evasive in his dilated, vibrating eyes. He was barely conscious of the girl, intoxicated with his own desperation, that held him mindless and distant. To her, the atmosphere of the room was almost unbreath-able, since he had come in. She felt terribly bound, walled up. She rose with a sudden movement that tore his nerves. She looked to him tall and bright and dangerous, as she faced [284] D. H. Lawrence round on him. "Have you come back with a fortune?" she cried, in mockery, her eyes full of dangerous light. He was unfastening his belt, to change his tunic. She watched him up and down, all the time. He could not answer, his lips seemed dumb.  Besides, silence was his strength. "Have you come back with a fortune?" she repeated, in her strong, clear voice of mockery. "No," he said, suddenly turning. "Let it please you that— that I've come back at all." He spoke desperately, and tailed oft into silence. He was a man doomed. She looked at him: he was insignificant in his doom. She turned in ridicule. And yet she was afraid; she loved him. He had stood long enough exposed, in his helplessness. With difficulty he took a few steps, went and sat down at the writing-table. He looked to her like a dog with its tail between its legs. He saw the paper, where her name was repeatedly written. She must find great satisfaction in her own name, he thought vaguely. Then he picked up the seal and kept twisting it round in his fingers, doing some little trick. And continually the seal fell on to the table with a sudden rattle that made Marta stiffen cruelly.   He was quite oblivious of her. She stood watching as he sat bent forward in his stupefaction. The fine cloth of his uniform showed the moulding of his back. And something tortured her as she saw him, till she could hardly bear it: the desire of his finely-shaped body, the stupefaction and the abjectness of him now, his immersion in the tragedy of himself, his being unaware of her. All her will seemed to grip him, to bruise some manly nonchalance and attention out of him. "I suppose you're in a fury with me, for being late?" he said, with impotent irony in his voice. Her fury over trifles, when he was lost in calamity!  How great was his real misery, [285] The Mortal Coil how trivial her small offendedness! Something in his tone burned her, and made her soul go cold. "I'm not exactly pleased," she said coldly, turning away to a window. Still he sat bent over the table, twisting something with his fingers. She glanced round on him. How nervy he was! He had beautiful hands, and the big topaz signet-ring on his finger made yellow lights. Ah, if only his hands were really dare-devil and reckless! They always seemed so guilty, so cowardly. "I'm done for now," he said suddenly, as if to himself, tilting back his chair a little. In all his physical movement he was so fine and poised, so sensitive! Oh, and it attracted her so much! aWhy?" she said, carelessly. An anger burned in him. She was so flippant. If he were going to be shot, she would not be moved more than about half a pound of sweets. "Why!" he repeated laconically. "The same unimportant reason as ever." "Debts?" she cried, in contempt. "Exactly." Her soul burned in anger. "What have you done now?—lost more money?" "Three thousand marks." She was silent in deep wrath. "More fool you!" she said. Then, in her anger, she was silent for some minutes. "And so you're done for, for three thousand marks?" she exclaimed, jeering at him. "You go pretty cheap." "Three thousand—and the rest," he said, keeping up a manly sang froid. "And the rest!" she repeated in contempt. "And for three thousand—and the rest, your life is over!" [286] D. H. Lawrence "My career," he corrected her. "Oh," she mocked, "only your career!   I thought it was a matter of life and death.  Only your career?  Oh, only that!" His eyes grew furious under her mockery. "My career is my life," he said. "Oh, is it!—You're not a man then, you are only a career?" "I am a gentleman." "Oh, are you! How amusing! How very amusing, to be a gentleman and not a man!—I suppose that's what it means, to be a gentleman, to have no guts outside your career?" "Outside my honor—none." "And might I ask what is your honor?" She spoke in extreme irony. "Yes, you may ask," he replied coolly. " But if you don't know without being told, I'm afraid I could never explain it." "Oh, you couldn't! No, I believe you—you are incapable of explaining it, it wouldn't bear explaining." There was a long, tense pause. "So you've made too many debts, and you're afraid they'll kick you out of the army, therefore your honor is gone, is it?—And what then—what after that?" She spoke in extreme irony. He winced again at her phrase "kick you out of the army." But he tilted his chair back with assumed nonchalance. "I've made too many debts, and I know they'll kick me out of the army," he repeated, thrusting the thorn right home to the quick. "After that—I can shoot myself. Or I might even be a waiter in a restaurant—or possibly a clerk, with twenty-five shillings a week." "Really!—All those alternatives!—Well, why not, why not be a waiter in the Germania?   It might be awfully jolly." "Why not?" he repeated ironically. "Because it wouldn't become me." She looked at him, at his aristocratic fineness of physique, his extreme physical sensitiveness. And all her German worship for his old, proud family rose up in her.  No, he could [287] The Mortal Coil not be a waiter in the Germania: she could not bear it. He was too refined and beautiful a thing. "Ha!" she cried suddenly. "It wouldn't come to that, either. If they kick you out of the army, you'll find somebody to get round—you're like a cat, you'll land on your feet." But this was just what he was not. He was not like a cat. His self-mistrust was too deep. Ultimately he had no belief in himself, as a separate isolated being. He knew he was sufficiently clever, an aristocrat, good-looking, the sensitive superior of most men. The trouble was, that apart from the social fabric he belonged to, he felt himself nothing, a cipher. He bitterly envied the common working-men for a certain manly aplomb, a grounded, almost stupid self-confidence he saw in them. Himself—he could lead such men through the gates of hell—for what did he care about danger or hurt to himself, whilst he was leading? But—cut him off from all this, and what was he? A palpitating rag of meaningless human life. But she, coming from the people, could not fully understand. And it was best to leave her in the dark. The free indomitable self-sufficient being which a man must be in his relation to a woman who loves him—this he could pretend. But he knew he was not it. He knew that the world of man from which he took his value was his mistress beyond any woman. He wished, secretly, cravingly, almost cravenly, in his heart, it was not so.  But so it was. Therefore, he heard her phrase "you're like a cat," with some bitter envy. "Whom shall I get round?—some woman, who will marry me?" he said. This was a way out. And it was almost the inevitable thing, for him. But he felt it the last ruin of his manhood, even he. The speech hurt her mortally, worse than death. She would rather he died, because then her own love would not turn [288] D. H. Lawrence to ash. "Get married, then, if you want to," she said, in a small broken voice. "Naturally," he said. There was a long silence, a foretaste of barren hopelessness. "Why is it so terrible to you," she asked at length, "to come out of the army and trust to your own resources? Other men are strong enough." "Other men are not me," he said. Why would she torture him? She seemed to enjoy torturing him. The thought of his expulsion from the army was an agony to him, really worse than death. He saw himself in the despicable civilian clothes, engaged in some menial occupation. And he could not bear it. It was too heavy a cross. Who was she to talk? She was herself, an actress, daughter of a tradesman. He was himself. How should one of them speak for the other? It was impossible. He loved her. He loved her far better than men usually loved their mistresses. He really cared.—And he was strangely proud of his love for her, as if it were a distinction to him . . . But there was a limit to her understanding. There was a point beyond which she had nothing to do with him, and she had better leave him alone. Here in this crisis, which was his crisis, his downfall, she should not presume to talk, because she did not understand.—But she loved to torture him, that was the truth. "Why should it hurt you to work?" she reiterated. He lifted his face, white and tortured, his grey eyes flaring with fear and hate. "Work!" he cried. "What do you think I am worth?— Twenty-five shillings a week, if I am lucky." His evident anguish penetrated her. She sat dumbfounded, looking at him with wide eyes. He was white with misery and fear; his hand, that lay loose on the table, was abandoned [289] The Mortal Coil in nervous ignominy. Her mind filled with wonder, and with deep, cold dread. Did he really care so much? But did it really matter so much to him? When he said he was worth twenty-five shillings a week, he was like a man whose soul is pierced. He sat there, annihilated. She looked for him, and he was nothing then. She looked for the man, the free being that loved her. And he was not, he was gone, this blank figure remained. Something with a blanched face sat there in the chair, staring at nothing. His amazement deepened with intolerable dread. It was as if the world had fallen away into chaos. Nothing remained.  She seemed to grasp the air for foothold. He sat staring in front of him, a dull numbness settled on his brain. He was watching the flame of the candle. And, in his detachment, he realized the flame was a swiftly travelling flood, flowing swiftly from the source of the wick through a white surge and on into the darkness above. It was like a fountain suddenly foaming out, then running on dark and smooth. Could one dam the flood? He took a piece of paper, and cut off the flame for a second. The girl in red started at the pulse of the light. She seemed to come to, from some trance. She saw his face, clear now, attentive, abstract, absolved. He was quite absolved from his temporal self. "It isn't true," she said, "is it? It's not so tragic, really?— It's only your pride is hurt, your silly little pride?" She was rather pleading. He looked at her with clear steady eyes. "My pride!" he said. "And isn't my pride me? What am I without my pride?" "You are yourself," she said. "If they take your uniform off you, and turn you naked into the street, you are still yourself " His eyes grew hot.  Then he cried : "What does it mean, myself!   It means I put on ready- [290] D. H. Lawrence made civilian clothes and do some dirty drudging elsewhere: that is what myself amounts to." She knitted her brows. "But what you are to me—that naked self which you are to me—that is something, isn't it?—everything," she said. "What is it, if it means nothing?" he said: "What is it, more than a pound of chocolate dragées?—It stands for nothing—unless as you say, a petty clerkship, at twenty-five shillings a week." These were all wounds to her, very deep. She looked in wonder for a few moments. "And what does it stand for now?" she said. "A magnificent second-lieutenant!" He made a gesture of dismissal with his hand. She looked at him from under lowered brows. "And our love!" she said. "It means nothing to you, nothing at all?" "To me as a menial clerk, what does it mean? What does love mean! Does it mean that a man shall be no more than a dirty rag in the world?—What worth do you think I have in love, if in life I am a wretched inky subordinate clerk?" "What does it matter?" "It matters everything." There was silence for a time, then the anger flashed up in her. "It doesn't matter to you what I feel, whether I care or not," she cried, her voice rising. "They'll take his little uniform with buttons off him, and he'll have to be a common little civilian, so all he can do is to shoot himself!—It doesn't matter that I'm there—" He sat stubborn and silent. He thought her vulgar. And her raving did not alter the situation in the least. "Don't you see what value you put on me, you clever little man?" she cried in fury. "I've loved you, loved you with all my soul, for two years—and you've lied, and said you loved [291] The Mortal Coil me. And now, what do I get? He'll shoot himself, because his tuppenny vanity is wounded.—Ah, fool—!" He lifted his head and looked at her. His face was fixed and superior. "All of which," he said, "leaves the facts of the case quite untouched!" She hated his cool little speeches. "Then shoot yourself," she cried, "and you'll be worth less than twenty-five shillings a week!" There was a fatal silence. "Then there'll be no question of worth," he said. "Ha!" she ejaculated in scorn. She had finished. She had no more to say. At length, after they had both sat motionless and silent, separate, for some time, she rose and went across to her hat and cloak. He shrank in apprehension. Now, he could not bear her to go. He shrank as if he were being whipped. She put her hat on, roughly, then swung her warm plaid cloak over her shoulders. Her hat was of black glossy silk, with a sheeny heap of cocks-feathers, her plaid cloat was dark green and blue, it swung open above her clear harsh-red dress. How beautiful she was, like a fiery Madonna! "Good-bye," she said, in her voice of mockery. "I'm going now." He sat motionless, as if loaded with fetters. She hesitated, then moved toward the door. Suddenly, with a spring like a cat, he was confronting her, his back to the door. His eyes were full and dilated, like a cat's, his face seemed to gleam at her. She quivered, as some subtle fluid ran through her nerves. "Let me go," she said dumbly. "I've had enough." His eyes, with a wide, dark electric pupil, like a cat's, only watched her objectively. And again a wave of female sub-missiveness went over her. "I want to go," she pleaded.   "You know it's no good.— [292] D. H. Lawrence You know this is no good." She stood humbly before him. A flexible little grin quivered round his mouth. "You know you don't want me," she persisted. "You know you don't really want me.—You only do this to show your power over me—which is a mean trick." But he did not answer, only his eyes narrowed in a sensual, cruel smile. She shrank, afraid, and yet she was fascinated. "You won't go yet," he said. She tried in vain to rouse her real opposition. "I shall call out," she threatened. "I shall shame you before people." His eyes narrowed again in the smile of vindictive, mocking indifference. "Call then," he said. And at the sound of his still, cat-like voice, an intoxication ran over her veins. "I will" she said, looking defiantly into his eyes. But the smile in the dark, full, dilated pupils made her waver into submission again. "Won't you let me go?" she pleaded sullenly. Now the smile went openly over his face. "Take your hat off," he said. And with quick, light fingers he reached up and drew out the pins of her hat, unfastened the clasp of her cloak, and laid her things aside. She sat down in a chair. Then she rose again, and went to the window. In the street below, the tiny figures were moving just the same. She opened the window, and leaned out, and wept. He looked round at her in irritation as she stood in her long, clear-red dress in the window-recess, leaning out. She was exasperating. "You will be cold," he said. [293] The Mortal Coil She paid no heed. He guessed, by some tension in her attitude, that she was crying. It irritated him exceedingly, like a madness. After a few minutes of suspense, he went across to her, and took her by the arm. His hand was subtle, soft in its touch, and yet rather cruel than gentle. "Come away," he said. "Don't stand there in the air— come away." He drew her slowly away to the bed, she sat down, and he beside her. "What are you crying for?" he said in his strange, penetrating voice, that had a vibration of exultancy in it. But her tears only ran faster. He kissed her face, that was soft, and fresh, and yet warm, wet with tears. He kissed her again, and again, in pleasure of the soft, wet saltness of her. She turned aside and wiped her face with her handkerchief, and blew her nose. He was disappointed—yet the way she blew her nose pleased him. Suddenly she slid away to the floor, and hid her face in the side of the bed, weeping and crying loudly: "You don't love me—Oh, you don't love me—I thought you did, and you let me go on thinking it—but you don't, no, you don't, and I can't bear it.—Oh, I can't bear it." He sat and listened to the strange, animal sound of her crying. His eyes flickered with exultancy, his body seemed full and surcharged with power. But his brows were knitted in tension. He laid his hand softly on her head, softly touched her face, which was buried against the bed. She suddenly rubbed her face against the sheets, and looked up once more. "You've deceived me," she said, as she sat beside him. "Have I? Then I've deceived myself." His body felt so charged with male vigor, he was almost laughing in his strength. "Yes," she said enigmatically, fatally. She seemed absorbed in her thoughts.  Then her face quivered again. [294] D. H. Lawrence "And I loved you so much," she faltered, the tears rising. There was a clangor of delight in his heart. "I love you," he said softly, softly touching her, softly kissing her, in a sort of subtle, restrained ecstasy. She shook her head stubbornly. She tried to draw away. Then she did break away, and turned to look at him, in fear and doubt. The little, fascinating, fiendish lights were hovering in his eyes like laughter. "Don't hurt me so much," she faltered, in a last protest. A faint smile came on his face. He took her face between his hands and covered it with soft, blinding kisses, like a soft, narcotic rain. He felt himself such an unbreakable fountain-head of powerful blood. He was trembling finely in all his limbs, with mastery. When she lifted her face and opened her eyes, her face was wet, and her greenish-golden eyes were shining, it was like sudden sunshine in wet foliage. She smiled at him like a child of knowledge, through the tears, and softly, infinitely softly he dried her tears with his mouth and his soft young moustache. "You'd never shoot yourself, because you're mine, aren't you!" she said, knowing the fine quivering of his body, in mastery. "Yes," he said. "Quite mine?" she said, her voice rising in ecstasy. "Yes." "Nobody else but mine—nothing at all—?" "Nothing at all," he re-echoed. "But me?" came her last words of ecstasy. "Yes." And she seemed to be released free into the infinite of ecstasy. [295] The Mortal Coil II. They slept in fulfilment through the long night. But then strange dreams began to fill them both, strange dreams that were neither waking nor sleeping;—only, in curious weariness, through her dreams, she heard at last a continual low rapping. She awoke with difficulty. The rapping began again—she started violently. It was at the door—it would be the orderly rapping for Friedeburg. Everything seemed wild and unearthly. She put her hand on the shoulder of the sleeping man, and pulled him roughly, waited a moment, then pushed him, almost violently, to awake him. He woke with a sense of resentment at her violent handling. Then he heard the knocking of the orderly.   He gathered his senses. "Yes, Heinrich!" he said. Strange, the sound of a voice!   It seemed a far-off tearing sound.  Then came the muffled voice of the servant. "Half past four, Sir." "Right!" said Friedeburg, and automatically he got up and made a light. She was suddenly as wide awake as if it were daylight. But it was a strange, false day, like a delirium. She saw him put down the match, she saw him moving about, rapidly dressing. And the movement in the room was a trouble to her. He himself was vague and unreal, a thing seen but not comprehended. She watched all the acts of his toilet, saw all the motions, but never saw him. There was only a disturbance about her, which fretted her, she was not aware of any presence. Her mind, in its strange, hectic clarity, wanted to consider things in absolute detachment. For instance, she wanted to consider the cactus plant. It was a curious object with pure scarlet blossoms. Now, how did these scarlet blossoms come to pass, upon that earthly-looking unliving creature? Scarlet blossoms! How wonderful they were! What were they, then, how could one lay hold on their being? Her mind turned to him.  Him, too, how could one lay hold [296] D. H. Lawrence on him, to have him? Where was he, what was he? She seemed to grasp at the air. He was dipping his face in the cold water—the slight shock was good for him. He felt as if someone had stolen away his being in the night, he was moving about a light, quick shell, with all his meaning absent. His body was quick and active, but all his deep understanding, his soul was gone. He tried to rub it back into his face. He was quite dim, as if his spirit had left his body. "Come and kiss me," sounded the voice from the bed. He went over to her automatically. She put her arms round him, and looked into his face with her clear brilliant, grey-green eyes, as if she too were looking for his soul. "How are you?" came her meaningless words. "All right." "Kiss me." He bent down and kissed her. And still her clear, rather frightening eyes seemed to be searching for him inside himself. He was like a bird transfixed by her pellucid, grey-green, wonderful eyes. She put her hands into his soft, thick, fine hair, and gripped her hands full of his hair. He wondered with fear at her sudden painful clutching. "I shall be late," he said. "Yes," she answered. And she let him go. As he fastened his tunic he glanced out of the window. It was still night: a night that must have lasted since eternity. There was a moon in the sky. In the streets below the yellow street-lamps burned small at intervals. This was the night of eternity. There came a knock at the door, and the orderly's voice. "Coffee, Sir." "Leave it there." They heard the faint jingle of the tray as it was set down outside. [297] The Mortal Coil Friedeburg sat down to put on his boots. Then, with a man's solid tread, he went and took in the tray. He felt properly heavy and secure now in his accoutrement. But he was always aware of her two wonderful, clear, unfolded eyes, looking on his heart, out of her uncanny silence. There was a strong smell of coffee in the room. "Have some coffee?"   His eyes could not meet hers. "No, thank you." "Just a drop?" "No, thank you." Her voice sounded quite gay. She watched him dipping his bread in the coffee and eating quickly, absently. He did not know what he was doing, and yet the dipped bread and hot coffee gave him pleasure. He gulped down the remainder of his drink, and rose to his feet. "I must go," he said. There was a curious, poignant smile in her eyes. Her eyes drew him to her. How beautiful she was, and dazzling, and frightening, with this look of brilliant tenderness seeming to glitter from her face. She drew his head down to her bosom, and held it fast prisoner there, murmuring with tender, triumphant delight:  "Dear! Dear!" At last she let him lift his head, and he looked into her eyes, that seemed to concentrate in a dancing, golden point of vision in which he felt himself perish. "Dear!" she murmured.  "You love me, don't you?" "Yes," he said mechanically. The golden point of vision seemed to leap to him from her eyes, demanding something. He sat slackly, as if spellbound. Her hand pushed him a little. "Mustn't you go?" she said. He rose. She watched him fastening the belt round his body, that seemed soft under the fine clothes. He pulled on his great-coat, and put on his peaked cap. He was again a young officer. [298] D. H. Lawrence But he had forgotten his watch. It lay on the table near the bed. She watched him slinging it on his chain. He looked down at her. How beautiful she was, with her luminous face and her fine, stray hair!   But he felt far away. "Anything I can do for you?" he asked. "No, thank you—I'll sleep," she replied, smiling. And the strange golden spark danced on her eyes again, again he felt as if his heart were gone, destroyed out of him. There was a fine pathos too in her vivid, dangerous face. He kissed her for the last time, saying: "I'll blow the candles out, then?" "Yes, my love—and I'll sleep." "Yes—sleep as long as you like." The golden spark of her eyes seemed to dance on him like a destruction, she was beautiful, and pathetic. He touched her tenderly with his finger-tips, then suddenly blew out the candles, and walked across in the faint moonlight to the door. He was gone. She heard his boots click on the stone stairs —she heard the far below tread of his feet on the pavement. Then he was gone. She lay quite still, in a swoon of deathly peace. She never wanted to move any more. It was finished. She lay quite still, utterly, utterly abandoned. But again she was disturbed. There was a little tap at the door, then Teresa's voice saying, with a shuddering sound because of the cold : "Ugh!—I'm coming to you, Marta my dear. I can't stand being left alone." "I'll make a light," said Marta, sitting up and reaching for the candle. "Lock the door, will you, Resie, and then nobody can bother us." She saw Teresa, loosely wrapped in her cloak, two thick ropes of hair hanging untidily. Teresa looked voluptuously sleepy and easy, like a cat running home to the warmth. "Ugh!" she said, "it's cold!" And she ran to the stove.   Marta heard the chink of the [299] The Mortal Coil little shovel, a stirring of coals, then a clink of the iron door. Then Teresa came running to the bed, with a shuddering little run, she puffed out the light and slid in beside her friend. "So cold!" she said, with a delicious shudder at the warmth. Marta made place for her, and they settled down. "Aren't you glad you're not them?" said Resie, with a little shudder at the thought.  "Ugh!—poor devils!" "I am," said Marta. "Ah, sleep—sleep, how lovely!" said Teresa, with deep content.  "Ah, it's so good!" "Yes," said Marta. "Good morning, good night, my dear," said Teresa, already sleepily. "Good night," responded Marta. Her mind flickered a little. Then she sank unconsciously to sleep.  The room was silent. Outside, the setting moon made peaked shadows of the high-roofed houses; from twin towers that stood like two dark, companion giants in the sky, the hour trembled out over the sleeping town. But the footsteps of hastening officers and cowering soldiers rang on the frozen pavements. Then a lantern appeared in the distance, accompanied by the rattle of a bullock wagon. By the light of the lantern on the wagon-pole could be seen the delicately moving feet and the pale, swinging dewlaps of the oxen. They drew slowly on, with a rattle of heavy wheels, the banded heads of the slow beasts swung rhythmically. Ah, this was life! How sweet, sweet each tiny incident was! How sweet to Friedeburg, to give his orders ringingly on the frosty air, to see his men like bears shambling and shuffling into their places, with little dancing movements of uncouth playfulness and resentment, because of the pure cold. Sweet, sweet it was to be marching beside his men, sweet to hear the great thresh-thresh of their heavy boots in the unblemished silence, sweet to feel the immense mass of living [300] D. H. Lawrence bodies co-ordinated into oneness near him, to catch the hot waft of their closeness, their breathing. Friedeburg was like a man condemned to die, catching at every impression as at an inestimable treasure. Sweet it was to pass through the gates of the town, the scanty, loose suburb, into the open darkness and space of the country. This was almost best of all. It was like emerging in the open plains of eternal freedom. They saw a dark figure hobbling along under the dark side of a shed. As they passed, through the open door of the shed, in the golden light were seen the low rafters, the pale, silken sides of the cows, evanescent. And a woman with a red kerchief bound round her head lifted her face from the flank of the beast she was milking, to look at the soldiers threshing like multitudes of heavy ghosts down the darkness. Some of the men called to her, cheerfully, impudently. Ah, the miraculous beauty and sweetness of the merest trifles like these! They tramped on down a frozen, rutty road, under lines of bare trees. Beautiful trees! Beautiful frozen ruts in the road! Ah, even, in one of the ruts there was a silver of ice and of moon-glimpse. He heard ice tinkle as a passing soldier purposely put his toe in it.  What a sweet noise! But there was a vague uneasiness. He heard the men arguing as to whether dawn were coming. There was the silver moon, still riding on the high seas of the sky. A lovely thing she was, a jewel! But was there any blemish of day? He shrank a little from the rawness of the day to come. This night of morning was so rare and free. Yes, he was sure. He saw a colorless paleness on the horizon. The earth began to look hard, like a great, concrete shadow. He shrank into himself. Glancing at the ranks of his men, he could see them like a company of rhythmic ghosts. The pallor was actually reflected on their livid faces. This was the coming day!  It frightened him. [301] The Mortal Coil The dawn came. He saw the rosiness of it hang trembling with light, above the east. Then a strange glamor of scarlet passed over the land. At his feet, glints of ice flashed scarlet, even the hands of the men were red as they swung, sinister, heavy, reddened. The sun surged up, her rim appeared, swimming with fire, hesitating, surging up. Suddenly there were shadows from trees and ruts, and grass was hoar and ice was gold against the ebony shadow. The faces of the men were alight, kindled with life. Ah, it was magical, it was all too marvellous! If only it were always like this! When they stopped at the inn for breakfast, at nine o'clock, the smell of the inn went raw and ugly to his heart: beer and yesterday's tobacco! He went to the door to look at the men biting huge bites from their hunks of grey bread, or cutting off pieces with their clasp-knives. This made him still happy. Women were going to the fountain for water, the soldiers were chaffing them coarsely.  He liked all this. But the magic was going, inevitably, the crystal delight was thawing to desolation in his heart, his heart was cold, cold mud. Ah, it was awful. His face contracted, he almost wept with cold, stark despair. Still he had the work, the day's hard activity with the men. Whilst this lasted, he could live. But when this was over, and he had to face the horror of his own cold-thawing mud of despair: ah, it was not to be thought of. Still, he was happy at work with the men : the wild desolate place, the hard activ-ity of mock warfare. Would to God it were real : war, with the prize of death! By afternoon the sky had gone one dead, livid level of grey. It seemed low down, and oppressive. He was tired, the men were tired, and this let the heavy cold soak in to them like despair.   Life could not keep it out. And now, when his heart was so heavy it could sink no [302] D. H. Lawrence more, he must glance at his own situation again. He must remember what a fool he was, his new debts like half thawed mud in his heart. He knew, with the cold misery of hopelessness, that he would be turned out of the army. What then? —what then but death? After all, death was the solution for him.   Let it be so. They marched on and on, stumbling with fatigue under a great leaden sky, over a frozen dead country. The men were silent with weariness, the heavy motion of their marching was like an oppression. Friedeburg was tired too, and deadened, as his face was deadened by the cold air. He did not think any more; the misery of his soul was like a frost inside him. He heard someone say it was going to snow. But the words had no meaning for him. He marched as a clock ticks, with the same monotony, everything numb and cold-soddened. They were drawing near to the town. In the gloom of the afternoon he felt it ahead, as unbearable oppression on him. Ah the hideous suburb! What was his life, how did it come to pass that life was lived in a formless, hideous grey structure of hell! What did it all mean? Pale, sulphur-yellow lights spotted^ the livid air, and people, like soddened shadows, passed in front of the shops that were lit up ghastly in the early twilight. Out of the colorless space, crumbs of snow came and bounced animatedly off the breast of his coat. At length he turned away home, to his room, to change and get warm and renewed, for he felt as cold-soddened as the grey, cold, heavy bread which felt hostile in the mouths of the soldiers. His life was to him like this dead, cold bread in his mouth. As he neared his own house, the snow was peppering thinly down. He became aware of some unusual stir about the house-door. He looked—a strange, closed-in wagon, people, police. The sword of Damocles that had hung over his heart, fell. O God, a new shame, some new shame, some new torture!   His body moved on.   So it would move on through [303] The Mortal Coil misery upon misery, as is our fate. There was no emergence, only this progress through misery unto misery, till the end. Strange, that human life was so tenacious! Strange, that men had made of life a long, slow process of torture to the soul. Strange, that it was no other than this! Strange; that but for man, this misery would not exist. For it was not God's misery, but the misery of the world of man. He saw two officials push something white and heavy into the cart, shut the doors behind with a bang, turn the silver handle, and run round to the front of the wagon. It moved off. But still most of the people lingered. Friedeburg drifted near in that inevitable motion which carries us through all our shame and torture. He knew the people talked about him.  He went up the steps and into the square hall. There stood a police-officer, with a note-book in his hand, talking to Herr Kapell, the housemaster. As Friedeburg entered through the swing door, the housemaster, whose brow was wrinkled in anxiety and perturbation, made a gesture with his hand, as if to point out a criminal. "Ah!—the Herr Baron von Friedeburg!" he said, in self-exculpation. The police officer turned, saluted politely, and said, with the polite, intolerable suffisance of officialdom: "Good evening! Trouble here!" "Yes?" said Friedeburg. He was so frightened, his sensitive constitution was so lacerated, that something broke in him, he was a subservient, murmuring ruin. "Two young ladies found dead in your room," said the police-official, making an official statement. But under this cold impartiality of officialdom, what obscene unction! Ah, what obscene exposures now! "Dead!" ejaculated Friedeburg, with the wide eyes of a child.   He became quite child-like, the official had him com- [304] D. H. Lawrence pletely in his power. He could torture him as much as he liked. "Yes." He referred to his note-book. "Asphyxiated by fumes from the stove." Friedeburg could only stand wide-eyed and meaningless. "Please—will you go upstairs?" The police-official marshalled Friedeburg in front of himself. The youth slowly mounted the stairs, feeling as if transfixed through the base of the spine, as if he would lose the use of his legs.  The official followed close on his heels. They reached the bedroom. The policeman unlocked the door. The housekeeper followed with a lamp. Then the official examination began. "A young lady slept here last night?" "Yes." "Name, please?" "Marta Hohenest." "H-o-h-e-n-e-s-t," spelled the official.   "—And address?" Friedeburg continued to answer. This was the end of him. The quick of him was pierced and killed. The living dead answered the living dead in obscene antiphony. Question and answer continued, the note-book worked as the hand of the old dead wrote in it the replies of the young who was dead. The room was unchanged from the night before. There was her heap of clothing, the lustrous, pure-red dress lying soft where she had carelessly dropped it. Even, on the edge of the chair-back, her crimson silk garters hung looped. But do not look, do not see. It is the business of the dead to bury their dead. Let the young dead bury their own dead, as the old dead have buried theirs. How can the dead remember, they being dead? Only the living can remember, and are at peace with their living who have passed away. [305] Three Improbables By Benjamin DeCasseres I.   The Ruling Passion PIERRE CHARDON, professor of philosophy in the University of Paris and sharpshooter to Her Majesty, La Belle France, sat concealed in the branches of an old oak slightly beyond the first line of trenches in the Champagne. A warm winter night of unusual clarity, although there was no moon. The hidden Lapidary of the Stars had put some magic substance into their gleam on this night, for their rays fell on the German trenches with mystifying potency. Pierre was comfortable, crouched against a giant limb about five feet from the ground. He had slept all that day. His brain was clear and his eyes sparkled like two polished and aureate stones. Now by one of those singular chances that many have noted in their lives there crawled toward that tree slowly and belly-wise Karl Kleine, professor of philosophy in the University of Heidelberg and scout to His Imperial Majesty, the King of Prussia. About twenty yards from Pierre Karl was discovered. Pierre fired a shot at the moving mass. It struck the helmet. The German, still flat on his stomach, raised his hands in token of surrender, his rifle having got, somehow or other, under his long coat. Pierre jumped from the tree and advanced toward Karl with his rifle pointed at his heart.   Karl stood there motion- [306] Benjamin DeCasseres less, hands up. And then the strange thing happened, and strange things happen in quite other places than the "movies" in the strangest of all known worlds. When about three feet from Karl Kleine, Pierre dropped his rifle in petrified astonishment and Karl's hands came down. "Karl!" "Pierre!" They embraced one another. A shell went screeching over their heads and a star dropped from Lyra into the nowhere. "The last time I saw you, Karl," said Pierre, leading the German back to the oak, while the butt of his rifle trailed the ground, "you still stuck to the dillettantism of Renan as the last thing in philosophy. You were going straight toward the pragmatism of William James. I never heard such a specious plea for that old utilitarian stuff, and—" "Ah!" said Karl, who had unconsciously squatted under the tree, in front of Pierre, "you still believe, then, in that old necromancer and moonshine-maker, Hegel, and all that spiritistic stuff!  The Absolute is—" "I never contended for the Absolute as thing-in-itself, and you can never quote me to that effect," shouted Pierre. "You had that crowd with you in that Heidelberg café that night, Karl, and you were ten to one; but I repeat now, as then, that —and—I quote Spinoza—" "Mon Dieu! Spinoza! At this late day," screamed back Karl, bringing down his fist on his helmet which he had put on the ground, "and you are going to bounce his modalities at me again? I put Epicurus against all that Spinoza rubbish, and you, Pierre, have got to come around sooner or later to the solid fact of experience—" "Experience! Experience! Gott im Himmel!" interrupted Pierre, kicking his rifle viciously, "what is experience? It is the content of an arc of the Unknowable Mind, the contact of Spirit with—" [307] Three Improbables "With what? With what?" asked Karl menacingly, as a German shell ripped a tree from its roots not a hundred feet away. (Neither paid the slightest attention to this incident.) "Contact of Spirit with what? Ten years ago at the picnic in the Bois you could not answer that question because, as Voltaire wittily said—" "Not beyond that old bore yet, either, I see!" thundered back Pierre. "You know what Goethe said about Voltaire and that crowd!  He said—" "Never mind what he said, anyhow. I'm your prisoner, Pierre.  Give me a cigarette and take me in." "You always did change the subject to something wholly beside the question when you got stuck, Karl. Every time I'd pin you down to your Epicurean-pragmatic-dillettante sophisms you'd switch to something else. Oh, well, come along. But I'll finish this out with you on my first leave of absence." Both rammed their helmets on their heads. Pierre forgot all about Karl's weapon and both disappeared in the forest dragging the butts of their rifles, while the star-swept darkness echoed with "Schlegel," "Schopenhauer," "Haeckel," "Berg-son," "Nietzsche" and "Diderot." II. The Truce of the Champions Guynemer, the great French aviator, rose into the sparkling light over the battle front. The day was hallucinatingly real, so real that, by the subtle law of the merging of opposites at the extremes of phenomenal visualization, the earth beneath him seemed to the eyes of the aviator to be a phantom world soaked and awash to its scalp in light. At two thousand feet directly over Arras he made a circle, and his soul stood petrified with wonder. To the north, toward the Pole, glowing in the ether, three figures in three cars were posed. They were in battle dress, their whips raised as though to strike the backs of their winged steeds, whose distended nostrils were pointed to the [308] Benjamin DeCasseres zenith. They vibrated, but did not move, and the lashes in the hands of these figures quivered, but did not descend. They were Alexander, Caesar and Napoleon. To the south, over the Northern Coast of Africa, on a direct level with the luminous figures in the north, three figures were posed. One was swathed in white, another in black, and the third shimmered against the heavens in naked contemplative glory. They stood upon altars of porphyry, their arms crossed. They vibrated, but did not move, and their arms quivered, but did not unlock. They were Buddha, Christ and Apollo. Guynemer, his mind struck to a stare, mechanically rose two thousand feet higher. And beneath the figures posed in the north he saw columns of skeletons, the vestiges of warrior beings. These columns held the cars of the conquerors in the azure and reached down to the roots of the universe. And beneath the figures posed to the south he saw columns of skeletons, the vestiges of billions of believing beings. These columns held the pedestals of the saviors in the azure and reached to the dark of the nadir. Now toward Guynemer there came flying the plane of the great German aviator, Bielstock. A white flag was hoisted in his helmet. Their four eyes, which overflowed their goggles, flew at one another. "Do you see anything?" called Bielstock. "Yes," replied Guynemer, "just what you see.   I'm ill." "So am I," replied Bielstock. "Let us descend. Auf wiedersehen!" "Au revoir" replied Guynemer. The champions did not battle that week. III.   Whom the Gods Love The Boy sat on the huge bank of snow that the snow sweepers had piled up in the middle of the street and hurled [309] Three Improbables snowballs at the sun, then very low in the clear western sky. He was a golden haired boy, with large, expressive brown eyes. He was about eight years old, and in the transfiguring power of the sun he seemed to me to be a plexus of beautiful rays, a mosaic of prisms. "Why do you throw your snowballs at the sun?" I asked the Boy. "Because I want to put that great fire out. Of course, I cannot hit the sun, but I am trying my best, and some day I shall make a snowball big enough and hurl it far enough to quench that light forever," replied the Boy as he threw a particularly big snowball at the orb. "But why do you want to put out the sun?" "Because I love the stars better, and cannot see the stars until the sun dies." "What will you do in summer when there are no snowballs to hurl at the sun?" "Papa takes me to the beach in summertime, and then I shall make huge balls of sand and throw them at the great red flame as it descends behind the ocean. Then, too, I shall see the beautiful stars—all of them, for there are no houses on the ocean to hide the view." The Boy looked far away, and the poised snowball dropped from his hand, as if arrested by a memory. "Do you like rainbows?" he asked, looking up at me, crossing his little legs in a mannish fashion. "Certainly," I replied. "Well," said he, "in summer days after the rain I go coasting down rainbows right into the sea with my sled. Can you coast down rainbows into the sea?   It is such sport! "And when it rains I capture the finest, biggest raindrops and blow them up to big sparkling bubbles—bubbles as big as a room, and I jump into them, where I see the strangest and prettiest fairies, with long golden wings and eyes like tiny painted stars. [310] Benjamin DeCasseres "And I eat the winds—the south-wind in April is like honey, and the north-wind in winter is like melted apple sauce." "And when you grow up to be a man what will you do?" I asked the Boy, finally. "Collect clouds," he whispered, "instead of money, like papa does." But the sun was gone and it was night, so I took the Boy to his house, the house, I recognized, of a very rich grocer. [311] Out of China By Eunice Tietjens The Hand AS you sit so, in the firelight, your hand is the color of new bronze. I cannot take my eyes from your hand; In it, as in a microcosm, the vast and shadowy Orient is made visible. Who shall read me your hand? You are a large man, yet it is small and narrow, like the hand of a woman, and the paw of a chimpanzee. It is supple and boneless as the hands wrought in pigment by a fashionable portrait painter. The tapering fingers bend backward. Between them burns a scented cigarette. You poise it with infinite daintiness, like a woman under the eyes of her lover. The long line of your curved nail is fastidiousness made flesh. Very skillful is your hand. With a tiny brush it can feather lines of ineffable suggestion, glints of hidden beauty. With a little tool it can carve strange dreams in ivory and milky jade. And cruel is your hand. With the same cold daintiness and skill it can devise exquisite tortures, eternities of incredible pain, that Torquemada never glimpsed. And voluptuous is your hand, nice in its sense of touch. [312] Eunice Tiet j ens Delicately it can caress a quivering skin, softly it can glide over golden thighs . . . Bilitis had not such long nails. Who can read me your hand? In the firelight the smoke curls up fantastically from the cigarette between your fingers which are the color of new bronze. The room is full of strange shadows. I am afraid of your hand . . . New China: The Iron Works The furnaces, the great steel furnaces, tremble and glow; gigantic machinery clanks, and in living iridescent streams the white-hot slag pours out. This is tomorrow set in yesterday, the west imbedded in the east, a graft but not a growth. And you who walk beside me, picking your familiar way between the dynamos, the cars, the piles of rails—you too are of tomorrow, grafted with an alien energy. You wear the costume of the west; you speak my tongue as one who knows; you talk casually of Sheffield, Pittsburgh, Essen . . . You touch on Socialism, walk-outs, and the industrial population of the British Isles. Almost you might be one of us. And then I ask: "How much do those poor coolies earn a day, who take the place of carts?" You smile and shrug. "Eighteen coppers. Something less than eight cents in your money.  They are not badly paid.  They do not die." [313] Out of China Again I ask: "And is it true that you've a Yamen, a police judge, all your own?"  Another shrug and smile. "Yes, he attends to all small cases of disorder.   For larger crimes we pass the offender over to the city courts." *      * * "Conditions" you explain as we sit later with a cup of tea, "conditions here are difficult." Your figure has grown lax, your voice a little weary. You are fighting, I can see, upheld by that strange graft of western energy. Yet odds are heavy, and the Orient is in your blood. Your voice is weary. "There are no skilled laborers," you say; "among the owners no co-operation. It is like—like working in a nightmare, here in China. It drags at me, it drags".  .  . . You bow me out with great civility. The furnaces, the great steel furnaces, tremble and glow, gigantic machinery clanks and in living iridescent streams the white-hot slag pours out. Beyond, the gate of filth begins again. A beggar rots and grovels, clutching at my skirt with leprous hands. A woman sits sorting hog-bristles; she coughs and sobs. The stench is sickening. Tomorrow! did they say? [314] Children of the Sun By Wallace Gould I SHE was an old free woman, forsaken. She walked along the highroad, humming, looking below upon the Sabbath-sleepy city which glimmered in the westward light of an afternoon of September and she saw that the world had collapsed and she looked upon the ruins of the world and they were yellow and white and brown and she turned from the highroad into a logging-road and began to wander and began to murmur and she murmured, in a kind of song, scattering white-plumed seeds as she wandered - "There is peace in the woods this afternoon, dear! There is peace in the woods this afternoon, my child! 'Tis quieted! 'Tis easier to die! Where are you now, dear? Where are you now, my child? Child, I am alone! Child, I am wandering-alone-alone-where the weeds and vines are broken down and entangled and tarnished! Child, I am weeping! [315] Children of the Sun Child, I am growing old! Oh, the dead weeds rasp and the dead vines rattle and I love you! Child, I love you! Child, I am growing old!" The afternoon light was as mellow as the glimmer of candles arranged around the faces of the dead and the winds were as low of sound as the music which is played when we pass before corpses, and were spiced with the odors of death and she sank upon her knees and the dead weeds rasped and the dead vines rattled and she wept. II ACROSS the heights the June winds racing, unhindered;     whistling through the ripening grasses, in whims, and around the rambling wall of rounded rocks, at will, and forever rumbling in my ears; rushing over the summit-fields and somewhere away and away and away into the fearful space of the valley and somewhere afar and afar and afar, perhaps to join the winds of other summits-— [316] Wallace Gould III TO me, the heat was disgusting. It was only when I sucked the fumes of my cigarette into me that I was conscious of breathing, so I pulled each drag to the bottom of my lungs where it struck with an ecstatic thud.  Nothing else seemed to be either passing into my lungs or out of them. It was depressingly hot. For an hour or more, that noon, I lolled in the shaded door of the barn, smoking, sweating, gasping, desperate with the general depression, relieved only by feeling the tobacco-smoke pass into and out of my lungs, and I made a diversion of blowing whirls at a caterpillar which clung to the tender leaves at the end of a long and low-hanging branch of woodbine. Then came the little old woman from across the alley. She was bent and wrinkled but quick of step and glance. The step was firm. The glance was sharp. She had once been a grand dame and had commanded servants and her perfumery had cost six dollars an ounce. On this day she wore a percale dress which was greasy and which was shielded in front by a greasier apron. Her perfumery was the sweat of a laboring body. While passing the garden she picked a green string-bean from the vines and began to chew it. She saw me. Uttering a little squeak of delight, she came and sat near me, on a pile of old boards. "Aint this a hell of a day?" she mumbled, munching the bean. "Certainly is," I said, turning my head to blow the smoke away from her. She watched the smoke vanish. "Blow your cussed old smoke this way!" she commanded, mumbling, munching the bean. "You know very well how I like it. I haven't smoked since the time-" and the poppies caught her eye. So, after that, I blew the smoke her way [317] Children of the Sun and she munched the bean and said no more for a while but sniffed the smoke and trotted one foot and gazed at the poppies. Soon, I arose and gathered some poppies- nine scarlet poppies- and gave them to her and blew a whiff in her face and she laughed and went home to warm over some soup. IV. WHAT can be said? What can be said when the pericarps of the wayside rose turn crimson, with leaves at the forest-edge? when all of the leaves of the countryside are coarse and their greens are dulled by dust? when the seeds of the meadow-grasses are dried and are bowed and hiss with the nervous winds? when, at the last, comes the goldenrod- head-dress of Autumn's steed whose gaudy caparison is gemmed with the fruits of things and the last low-trailing fringes of which drag, frayed, in the cold, gray mires of what is dead- when the shrunken river has broadened the marsh? when the water-snakes bask long in the sun? What can be said? [318] The Dream By Theodore Dreiser Scene: The vicinity of 115th Street and Broadway, New York City, on a warm, lowery May night.   Time, 1.15.

Syphers is medium in height, slim, fiery, black-whiskered, barbered to perfection. He is loquacious and demonstrative. Mitchell is attenuated, humped, grey. He is quite old. Barrett is fifty, blond, bald, heavy, silent. SYPHERS {As they reach the corner). WELL, I turn off here. That was an interesting discussion we had, eh? The fact is, Mitchell, as I told you the other day, I have passed out of my old materialistic point of view to a certain extent—not entirely— but now I see more order in things than I once did. It seems more or less inescapable to me, doesn't it to you? MITCHELL (Doubtfully) Well, yes, I should say so.   Of course— BARRETT (Dogmatically) I do not see how any one can doubt law. Everything obeys law of one kind and another. SYPHERS Quite so!  Quite so!  Nevertheless, there are so many con- [319] The D ream fusing contradictions.  You don't deny that, do you? BARRETT More knowledge might prove them to be anything but contradictory. SYPHERS Well, I admit that, too. I am merely suggesting that I see more definite order than I once did. A few years ago I could see nothing but disorder, chaos, the inexplicable clashing of forces. Of late I am not so sure. This matter of orthogenesis, now. It appeals to me very much as demonstrating an intellectual, if not a spiritual order—some great controlling force somewhere. I seem to see a definite tendency to order in things. Life has certainly built itself up through the ages in a very intelligent way, indeed. MITCHELL (To himself) Indeed!   Kind of him. BARRETT (Loftily) Yes, of course, but there is nothing very new in that. SYPHERS (Almost unconscious of interruption) I admit that. I admit that. What I am getting at is this. All life, as we know it, is based on the cell—cell origination, cell multiplication, cell arrangement. That is an old story. Now, here is something which is my idea, and which I hope isn't so old, and that is—it's a mere theory, of course—that the whole thing may have been originated, somehow, somewhere else outside of our visible material life—thought out beforehand, as it were, in the brain of something or somebody, and is now being orthogenetically directed from somewhere, being thrown on a screen, as it were, like a moving picture. And we are mere dot pictures, mere cell-built-up pictures, like the movies, only we are telegraphed or tele-autographed from somewhere [320] Theodore Dreiser else, like those dot pictures that are now made electrically— built up dot by dot, millions of them coming rapidly by wireless or wire, and being thrown on a screen of some kind— ether, the elements—you know what I mean. You have seen the telautograph pictures I mean, of course. BARRETT Yes, of course. Very ingenious. Very ingenious. But how do you go about to prove the origination of the cell in the fashion that you want? MITCHELL (Aside) A rather slow movie, I should say, considering the length of time the thing has been being built up. SYPHERS Well, in this way, for one thing. It has its drawbacks, of course. You remember the experiments of that Irish scientist Burke, don't you? He generated what he called a radiobe— a single cell, in a plasm culture which he had hermetically sealed, and which he kept under the influence of radium. I do not recall the exact facts of the case at the moment, and I do not believe that his deductions have since been accepted, but that is neither here nor there. That idea—his idea—illustrates my idea very well. If we could prove that one cell, one radiobe, had been or could be originated or generated by on outside influence of this kind—radium, if you wish, in a plasm of that kind—we would have to admit that the whole thing might be built up in some such fashion. The idea might be true. You could base a new philosophy on that, Mitchell. One radiobe generated in a plasm culture under radium or something else—some auto-genetic force manifesting itself through a thing like radium, and there you are. After that you would have to grant the possibility of millions and billions of cells coming in that fashion, whole nations constructed of cells, as they have been. [321] The Dream MITCHELL My dear Syphers! BARRETT There was some hitch in that experiment, however. The chain wasn't quite complete. SYPHERS I know. I know. I grant you that. All that I'm insisting on is that if one cell—one radiobe, say, can be generated by a synthesis of energy, why not millions?—and if millions, why not billions—the whole human family, in short, since we are a synthesis of cells—this whole visible scene in all its details? I know it sounds wild, but (to Mitchell) I have heard you yourself say that you thought it might be possible that we were all a part of some invisible psychic body—force body— in the mechanism of which we function in some way, just as the cells do in ours. MITCHELL (Much flattered) Yes, I have said as much. SYPHERS Well, then, why may not my theory be true? BARRETT May? May? Of course it may. But how are you going to prove it? I myself have suggested that Mitchell's larger psychic body, as he calls it, may be nothing more than a foetus, a secondary creature being built in the womb of a still larger organism, but what of it? All of us—everything that we see here—may be nothing more than the organs that you see being constructed in a child in the womb. This so-called higher psychic body may not even be complete yet—not ready to be born in its realm. But how do we know? There's nothing to prove it.  You can't prove it. SYPHERS Just the same, if I had a few hundred thousand dollars, I [322] Theodore Dreiser would enlarge my laboratory and pursue this subject. I believe that something may be discovered. I even believe that I could prove it in the course of time. Why, snow crystals, tree and flower forms, everything, gives us a hint, sometimes instantaneously. Why do snow crystals assume almost instantaneously, and out of nothing, their beautiful forms? The controlling impulse is certainly artistic, isn't it, and outside of anything we know? (He notes that he is boring his two friends.) Well, good night. Glad to see you two at the meeting tonight. It was interesting, wasn't it? (He bows and departs.) BARRETT (To Mitchell) He's an awful bore. MITCHELL I'm glad he's gone. SYPHERS Dolts!  Fogies!  That's always the way, dull and cautious. BARRETT (As they walk up the street) An ingenious theory, but dangerously speculative. He ought to read Stromeyer on "Impulse." MITCHELL I often wonder about his work and just how sound he is. Syphers reaches his own house and goes up the steps. He unlocks the door and mounts the inside stairs to his room. He lights the gas in a chamber which is half library and half bedroom. SYPHERS (Seating himself and gazing about dreamily) A great idea. I'm sure of it. Along this line is coming a scientific revolution. If I had sufficient quantities of radium and stromium, why,—but they cost so much. (He yawns) Life is really a dream. We are all an emanation, a shadow—a moving picture cast on a screen of ether—I'm sure of it.   (He gazes [323] The Dream about, yawns again, and begins to undress.) A TELEGRAPH INSTRUMENT (At the 110th Street Station) Tick, tick, tick,—tick, tick— tick,—tick—tick—tick—; tick—tick—tick. TELEGRAPH OPERATOR There goes that blamed machine again. (He begins to write) "Professor George Paul Syphers, 621 West 115th Street, New York City. Your uncle, Edward Fillmore, died at eleven tonight. By the terms of his will you are the sole heir to the bulk of his fortune, three hundred thousand dollars. Come at once. A. J. Berwin, Counsellor." (Aside) I wish someone would leave me three thousand cents. (To a waiting telegraph messenger) Here, Patsy. Take this up to 115th Street. PATSY LAFERTY (Cock-eyed, overgrown, contentious) Sure, it's just de night to keep busy. It's goin' to rain, an' it's my late watch. Oh, well, dere's nuttin like bein' poor an' honest. (He seizes a black cotton umbrella almost as large as himself, and goes out.) SYPHERS (Crawling into his bed) The curious thing is: why should any dominant force outside this seeming life wish to create it—the smallness, the pettiness, the suffering? I must write a book about that. Here I am—(he suddenly bethinks him of opening a window, and gets out. Looking out) It's going to rain, I do believe. (He returns and stretches himself to rest) There, it's thundering already. (Thunder and lightning manifest themselves.) PATSY LAFERTY (Trudging up Broadway) It's funny — dese mokes wot git messages at one in de mornin'. I'll lay a even bet I don't git nuttin, neider. If you'd come wit a million dollars after twelve o'clock, dere's guys wot'd git sore. [324] Theodore Dreiser SYPHERS (Dozing, but still continuing his speculations, hazily) I must try to find the psychic impulse which originates and directs the cell. That is the great thing. We're all shadows, I say—shadows—adumbrations—impalpable nothings—rumors—dreams. (He turns on his side) If our ills become too great we might be able to wake up or drive them away by thinking of this. It may be that we do when we die—wake up, perhaps. But that's Christian Science, isn't it? Bah! Anyhow, the impulse which creates cells can possibly be discovered. (He snores slightly) Or, if we are cell-built, we might find something to counteract the cell building tendency—overcome it—then we would disappear and all our troubles with us—or wake up to something else, if we are anything else.   I wonder.   I wonder.   (He sleeps.) PATSY LAFERTY (Arriving at the door and closing his umbrella) A fine night, dis.   An' he won't be in.   Wot'll ya bet?   Wait an' see.   (He rings the bell.) SYPHERS (Beginning to dream) Radiobes! Radiobes! Flying ra-diobes as big as a house—monsters—(He stirs. As he does so the ringing of the house bell, the rising wind and the thunder and lightning which rapidly become violent identify themselves in some weird way with his thoughts. He is on a large plain now, over which a battle is being fought. The flashes of lightning and bellows of thunder gradually identify themselves in his mind with some impending disaster, vague and yet oppressive. He begins to cerebrate in an imaginative, illogical way. A sense of something ominous pervades him— a feeling of great change. Then the rat-a-tat-tat of machine guns begins, and armed figures running and fighting appear in the distance.) [325] The Dream SYPHERS (Who has once seen military service) War! And fighting men! (It begins to rain) That is a machine gun. Now I am in real danger. How did I come here, anyhow? (He moves a hand, thinking he is hurrying to cover.) PATSY LAFERTY (Standing at the door, ringing the bell, and shifting from one foot to the other) Wot a swell night! Wot a swell night! Now it's beginnin' to pour, an' I'll have to stand here awhile, I suppose. Holy Cripes—dem drops is as big as marbles. (He presses the electric button again.) THE PROFESSOR (Hearing the whirr of the buzzer in his dreams and taking it for the rush of artillery and men) Ah, the horror of war! What was I thinking? Ah, yes! If one had some method of waking up. (He mingles the dream notions of his waking philosophy with the figures of his dream) Then there would be no war like this—no horrors. It is entirely possible, now that we know that this existence of ours is a dream—this whole troublesome scheme of things—to wake up. I may be dreaming now—who knows? If so, I could wake up and all my ills would vanish—or would they? If the universe were kind? (As the thunder and lightning outside increase) How horrible this is!   (The dream sky lights up as if with red fire.) PATSY LAFERTY T-r-r-r! —t-r-r-r-r! t-r-r-r-r! Wot's de matter wit dis bell? W'y don't de guy answer? THE PROFESSOR (Dreaming and looking about him in apprehension) War! War! How terrible! How did I come here? How does there happen to be war? Those are fighting men over there! They are killing each other!   Horrors!   But the great thing [326] Theodore Dreiser is to escape, I suppose. I must escape. That fire is dreadful. It means death. (He struggles to put himself in motion and grunts in his sleep.) PATSY LAFERTY (Ringing again) Well, dis is some sleeper, all right. Or dere ain't nobody home. I'll kick, I will. (He kicks) Come to. I ain't supposed to stand here all night. (He rings the door bell.   The kick and knocks are without result.) SYPHERS (Still dreaming heavily) And here comes a file of soldiers— I hear them tramping—a great company. Merciful heavens, they see me. (He begins to run. As he does so, the file of dream soldiers begin to run also.) THE FILE OF DREAM SOLDIERS Halt! THE PROFESSOR (Breaking into a heavy sweat) Great God! I haven't done a thing! And I haven't a place to hide! Oh, Lord! What shall I do? (He turns, and in his dream he imagines a deserted stone hut set in a grove of thick tall trees, which seem to offer shelter. He runs toward the hut) As I live, here is a stone hut among thick trees. I'll hide in it. Perhaps they won't see me. (He dashes wildly in, slamming a heavy door behind him.) A SCORE OF DREAM SOLDIERS (Hurrying up and knocking with their musket butts on the door) Knock!   Knock! Knock! PATSY LAFERTY (At the front door of the house) Knock!   Knock! Knock! Gee, wot a night!   Dese rain drops look like spits.   An' dat lightning!  Dat last one looked like a telegraph pole standin' straight in de air. [327] The Dream SYPHERS (Cowering in a corner) Oh, Lord! My life is worth nothing. Here I lie hiding in an empty stone hut and those men at the door want my life. What is life? A dream! A dream! —but, oh, such a precious dream! I would not want to disappear—not yet; even if I could. No! No! I would not want to wake up. I don't want to die—Not yet! Not yet!— (As he lies there cowering, all the coruscations and thunder of a great battle afflict him, cannon, machine guns, human cries, commands. He cowers lower and yet in spite of the thickness of the walls which seem to protect him, he can see through them to the surrounding trees to where the dream soldiers await him—tall men in red coats and towering shakos—and beyond them again to the battlefield, red with flame and gore. As he stares, the men in the shakos glare at him.) FIRST DREAM SOLDIER (Pointing at him, and speaking to another) We'll easily get him out of there. Can't you see him lying there, close by the wall? (To the other soldiers) Bring a battering ram. (A second soldier starts off) No, bring a cannon. We'll blow him out. (A third soldier goes) He thinks we can't get him, but we can. (Other soldiers draw near. They move in the curious, indefinite way common to figures in dreams. Nothing is clear, and yet there is a sense of impending disaster. The Professor studies the nature of his predicament with a sense of horror.  He observes the subtlety of their movements.) THE PROFESSOR (Lying on the floor, close to the wall) Ah, if I could only escape! I was thinking awhile ago that life was a shadow of something else—an adumbration—a thing built up point by point like the dots of a telautographed picture. Now if that were so, I could get out of here. It would be a dream. I could wake.  I could cry "Avaunt!"  I could stir and it would [328] Theodore Dreiser all disappear and become as nothing. But here! Here—(He pauses and stares. A company of dream soldiers on horseback gallop up and swing a cannon into position.) THE CAPTAIN OF THE DREAM SOLDIERS (Dramatically) Position!    (They unhook the horses and man the guns) Load!   (A shell is put in) Fire!   (It belches flames and smoke.  A great hole is torn in the wall of the hut.) PATSY LAFERTY (At the door) Gee! Dat last crack was a boid! If he kin sleep troo dat he soitainly won't hear me—or maybe he ain't home. Well, anyhow, I might as well stand here. I can't go back in dis. (He decides to make himself as comfortable as possible in the doorway.) THE PROFESSOR (Imagining he is crying) Help! Help! Oh, save me! Save me!   (He realizes that he emits no sound and groans.) FIRST DREAM OFFICER Once more, now, men!   Another shell here! (Another shell is put in.) Fire! THE CANNON Poof!   Boom!   (Another great hole is torn in the wall.) PATSY LAFERTY (As a second electric crash occurs) I don't know wedder I'd better stay here.   I don't want to git killed.   (He walks about uneasily.) THE PROFESSOR (Heavily and desperately) I am lost. I know it. Oh, if my idea were only true! What if all this turmoil and agony were a figment of the mind merely—a cell or dot picture. Here I am in this hut. These soldiers are about to destroy me. They are tearing my abode to pieces. Soon they will kill me. If I could just cry "Avaunt!   Disappear!"—or if I could [329] The Dream know that I am not real, and disappear myself. I wonder if I might not try it.   (He jumps to his feet.) A FLASH OF LIGHTNING Click—ssss! A CLAP OF REAL THUNDER Boom—! THE PROFESSOR (To the dream soldiers, defiantly) I defy you! Do your worst! You're not real! I'm not real. This whole thing is a dream! I'm a dream, or I'm dreaming.  I defy you! FIRST DREAM SOLDIER (Drawing near with a rifle) Is that so?  You defy me, do you?  I'll show you whether I'm real or not.   (He takes deliberate aim.) SECOND DREAM SOLDIER Yes, kill him.  That's the way! THIRD DREAM SOLDIER Now! THE PROFESSOR (Lifting his hand) Wait a moment! Don't! I beg of you! I'm—I'm not sure! FIRST DREAM SOLDIER But I will, though, just the same.   You say I'm not real? I'll show you whether I am or not.   (He fires) How does that feel? THE PROFESSOR (Who has twisted himself about until he has one hand under him in a most painful position) Oh, God! I'm shot! And now I'll die. This whole scene, real or not real, will pass away, and I will never know—or will I? And yet once I was a man. And it was good to be alive. Qh! Oh! Oh! (He weeps and sinks down.   A powerful clap of thunder half [33o] Theodore Dreiser arouses him.   The knocking of Patsy Lafterty becomes dimly audible—a cross between the clatter of musketry and a knock. He stares at the soldiers, some of whom seem already to be growing thin and wavering)  Dying!   Alas!   I'm dying! Or am I?   (He partially wakes)  What's this—I'm not dying, after all.   They're not real.    I'm only dreaming. How astonishing!  And yet I am dying in a sense, too.   I'm dying in so far as they are concerned.    (To the dream soldiers, defiantly.)     You're  not   real,   after   all.    You're mere shadows—thin air.   I'm dying, but you're not real. This house isn't real.   It couldn't have holes in it if it were, or at least I couldn't have seen through it in the first place if it was.   You're shadows, tissues or nothing, a mere fancy of the brain.  Oh, wonderful! FIRST DREAM OFFICER (Standing by the cannon which is thoroughly nebulous) Are we? Well, you're a fool. You're dying all right. Wire the real ones. Wait'll you die. You may be waking into another state, but you'll be dead to this one, won't you? But we won't! Ha! Ha! We'll still be here, alive. (To the second dream soldier) He thinks he's not real. He thinks that we're not real. He thinks he's not going to die, but wake up into something else! Ha! Ha! (They look at each other in a strange, fading, unreal way) When he passes out of this, won't he be dead to this, though? THE PROFESSOR (Amazedly) What is this, though? Am I dying, or waking up? Which is it? Are there various worlds, one within another? Are those soldiers really real? Great heavens! How strange! I am waking up, and yet this world in which I was is real enough, too. I died there. I certainly did, or I am dying there. (The house begins to dissolve like smoke—the trees can be seen right through the bodies of the soldiers.) [331] The Dream PATSY LAFERTY (At the door) I'll give dis guy one more spin and den I'll quit.   I ain't goin' to stand here all night—rain or no rain. Clump!   Clump!   Clump!   (He kicks with his heel at the same time that he rings.) THE PROFESSOR (Bounding out of bed) Oh, blessed heaven! What is that? I'm not dead, after all. I am really alive. It was a dream— all of it. How glad I am to be awake! All those shadows— and they were shadows—they aren't real at all. Thank God, I'm alive! That's a comfort. (He reaches for his trousers) But those soldiers! They argued with me about it! They did! They made fun of me! Isn't that amazing? This dream is a call to me to seek out this mystery. If ever I get money enough to do it, that is certainly what I will do. I shall devote all my life to solving this mystery. It is astounding! If only I could find somebody who would endow a laboratory for this purpose. (He pauses and stares as the bell whirrs) Yes, yes! I'm coming! (He bustles downstairs, turn-ning up the light as he goes.) PATSY LAFERTY (Irritably, as he opens the door) Syphers? THE PROFESSOR Yes. PATSY LAFERTY Telegram. Sign here. (He produces about a half inch of lead pencil and holds up a signature blank. The Professor signs. Absentmindedly he tears open the message, but while doing so turns and closes the door. Patsy Laferty stares at it disconsolately.) THE PROFESSOR (Reading) A miracle!   $300,000!   Just what I need for [332] Theodore Dreiser that laboratory! It's a sign! The dream is a portent—a call. My poor, dear, good uncle. What moved him to leave me that? Now I know the dream was an omen. And yet—(thinking of a certain maiden he has been courting)—should I really do that? Three hundred thousand are three hundred thousand and where would I ever get that much again? (He hesitates mentally) We could live beautifully on that money. I'm not so sure. Perhaps I could get someone else to furnish it. (He starts upstairs) But that poor boy. I forgot to give him a penny, and it's storming. (Returns and reopens the door, looks up and down the street, sees no one and comes back) Dear! Dear! Dear! I should have given him a dime, anyhow—bringing such a fortunate message. But I must think about this laboratory, though, and this money. I must not act too hastily, or inadvisedly. Three hundred thousand is three hundred thousand, and—(He goes upstairs again solemnly.) PATSY LAFERTY (One block south, staring at the sidewalk) Wot did I say? Wot did I say?   Dey never comes across wit nuttin after twelve—nuttin.   Not if you handed 'em a million. Dramatic rights reserved by the author [333] H. G. Wells, Theological Assembler By John Dewey LOOKING back, there now appears something peculiarly significant in Mr. Wells' long preoccupation with the bizarre and the extraordinary. His genius for the phantastic, now that he has come out into the open with a theology, is seen to be evidence not so much of an interest in the other side of things as of a belief that the other side is extraordinary, or, in the franker language of an older day, supernatural. His revelling in adventure evinced not a sense of the romantically possible in the seemingly ordinary —a sense like that, say, of Scott or Stevenson—but an extreme urgency after something, something that Mr. Wells wanted, something that he wouldn't be happy without. And if I confess to a certain satisfaction in the fullness of the later revelation of what is now seen to have been always implicit, it is because I find a justification of the obscure irritation which Mr. Wells' apocalyptic flights always stirred in me. "God, the Invisible King" (fortunately coincident in its publication with Mr. Wells' attacks upon monarchy on earth) labels, with startling unmistakableness, the theological implications of Mr. Britling—implications which without the later tag might have seemed religious. Of the concluding portion of the Britling novel a cynic might have said that Mr. Britling, finding himself alone in the dark, invented a God to keep him company and to give him assurance of the return of dawn. But a more sympathetic critic might have found in the book a vivid sense of forces moving co-operatively toward a better organization of humanity even amid its dark- [334] John Dewey est days; that sense of the better, that sense of possibilities, which is never more pathetic and never more noble than when it shines upon the most discouraging actuality. In spite of casual allusions to God as personal and conscious, one might easily have found in the book an illustration of that saying of Santayana's about religion: "Another world to live in —whether we expect ever to pass into it or not—is what we mean by having a religion." But in "God the Invisible King," Mr. Wells has done more than enter; he has even done more than take possession. He is a cicerone, showing a flock of personally conducted tourists all of the interesting high spots in this other world, a guide who is never more glibly eloquent than when turning into a "sight" some one of the dark and unsolved uncertainties of life. There is, so it appears, a "modern religion" already in existence. And Mr. Wells does not aspire to any such ambition as to be its prophet. It is enough for him to be its assembler and recorder. As Mr. Wells pontificates: "It is an account rendered. It is a statement and record; not a theory. There is nothing in all this that has been invented or constructed by the writer: I have been but a scribe to the spirit of my generation, I have at most assembled and put together things and thoughts that I have come upon—I have transferred the statements of 'science' into religious terminology, rejected obsolescent definitions and reco-ordinated propositions that had drifted into opposition." So simple a matter is it to set forth modern religion, not just a modern religion. In comparison with the fact that this material is all there, needing only to be assembled, co-ordinated, defined, and terminologized, the actual contents of modern religion seem to me to shrink into relative insignificance. But one gets the impression that such is decidedly not the case for Mr. Wells, that for him the matter of course is that the modern religion should be there, and the important matter concerns the some- [335] H. G. Wells, Theological Assembler what less than thirty-nine articles which constitute the true faith of which Mr. Wells is the phonographic recorder. While I cannot recover from my feeling that it is a tremendous comedown to pass from the fact of an established religion to its specifications, I feel bound therefore to record in my turn the gist of Mr. Wells' record. "God is a spirit, a single spirit and a single person: he has begun and he will never end." The corresponding damnatory clauses are not explicitly given. One gathers however that the heresy that God is triune ranks —as heresy—above the proposition that he doesn't exist at all, while the heresy that he is material and impersonal is less to be condemned than the one that he doesn't exist at all. In spite of the fact that "modern religion appeals to no authoritative teaching, to no mystery," modern religion declares that God is "immaterial," that "his nature is of the nature of thought and will. Not only has he, in his essence, nothing to do with matter, but nothing to do with space." Since he began and will not end, God does, however, have something to do with time. "He exists in time just as a current of thought may do." God, moreover, is finite and growing. He helps us and we help him. As to the exact relationship of these two helpings I have obtained, I am obliged to confess, no clear idea. It appears at times that "modern religion declares" (Mr. Wells' favorite expression) that God was born in and through man, and that he accomplishes nothing, becomes nothing, except through the assistance of man. But more often it seems to "declare" that man escapes his egoism and achieves what is fine only through inspiration secured from God when man yields complete allegiance. Such an inconsistency in an avowed piece of religious symbolism would amount to nothing. But in a defined theology, translated from science, and with the obsolescent eliminated, it argues some awkwardness in assembling and co-ordinating. Equal in extraordinariness to Mr. Wells' assurance in transcribing the tenets of modern religion, is his profound [336] John Dewey conviction that there is something remarkably up to date and liberal in his scheme. I could not have imagined a modern mind so explicit, so emphatic, so aggressive, in assertion of disbelief in a Trinity, in God as a personal creative omnipotent force, in the immaculate conception, in the necessity of an ecclesiastic organization to maintain religion, etc., etc. The spirit of zestful adventure, the unction of daring, with which Mr. Wells warns off those who cannot follow him in the commonplaces of theological rationalism is an illuminating comment on the intellectual tone which Mr. Wells assumes in his audience—unless it be an evidence of the recentness of his own education. The naivete of his assumption that traditional theology was not an assembling, a rendering, a definition and co-ordination, of what was current in the days of its origin, suggests that we are probably dealing with a state of mind common to Mr. Wells and the audience which he imagines himself addressing. It is difficult to resist the contagion of slang in intimating to Mr. Wells that in their own days various Councils, Synods and Assemblies were also some "assemblers." My long time suspicion that the evangelical mind in what is termed Anglo-Saxondom is much more thoroughly engrained than either orthodoxy or Puritanism is borne out by the chapter in which Mr. Wells sets forth the ethic, the "rule of life," implied in the disclosures of modern religion. Literary versatility has its full scope. "I become a knight in God's service. I become my brother's keeper. I become a responsible minister of my king." Somehow one sees—or is it mere perversity of fancy?—Christian Endeavor Societies turning into Knights Templar, Big Brother Associations, Orders of Prime Ministers and Ambassadors Plenipotentiary of the Invisible King, all with sashes, high signs, paraphernalia, and all beaming with the oil of annointment of an evangelicalized efficiency. Why quarrel with Brother Sunday because he still speaks a dialect which is going out of fashion among the cul- [337] H. G. Wells, Theological Assembler tured? Surely we all mean about the same. At times Mr. Wells does not even have to define, or to transfer from one language to other, or to reco-ordinate. Under the new religion, "for all, there are certain fundamental duties; a constant sedulousness to keep oneself fit and bright for God's service ... a hidden persistent watchfulness of one's baser motives, a watch against fear and indolence, against greed and lust, against envy, malice and uncharitableness." In view of the number of pages occupied with just such edificatory material, I am willing to predict that from multitudes of evangelical pulpits in this country will issue sermons welcoming Mr. Wells into the fold, accompanied with mild deplorings that he has not yet seen the full light. Only in England, I fancy, will Mr. Wells be able to realize an ambition to be roundly denounced for modern and dangerous tendencies. Of all this, I could make nothing and less than nothing, till I came across the following passage. Between benevolent atheists and those "who have found God" there is, Mr. Wells says, this difference: "The benevolent atheist stands alone upon his own good will, without a reference, without a standard, trusting to his own impulse to goodness, relying upon his own moral strength. . . . He has not really given himself or got away from himself. He has no one to whom he can give himself. His exaltation is self-centered, is priggishness. . . . His devotion is only the good will in himself, etc., etc." In short the only escape, for Mr. Wells, from an unrelieved egoism is recourse to a big Alter Ego upon whom is bestowed the name of God. Then there came to my mind that psychological mechanism to which has been given the name of "projection." When an individual finds a conflict in himself which is offensive and with which he cannot successfully cope directly, he "projects" it into or upon another personality, and then finds rest. Uneasy and tortured egoism, finding no rest for itself in itself, creates a huge Ego [338] John Dewey which, although finite and although not a creator of worlds, is still huge enough to be our King, Leader and Helper. And then I thought of the humbleminded in all ages and places who live in the sense of the infinite ties, a few perceived but most of them obscure, which bind them to their fellows, to the soil, to the air and to the light of day, and whose strength to suffer and to enjoy is renewed daily by contact and by intercourse. I then seemed better able to understand both that egoism which brings war into the world, and that egoism which revels in masking a baulked egoism by setting it forth in a journalistic declaration of the God of the modern mind. In the light of the world's catastrophe perhaps such is the religious creed of contemporary man. [339] THE   SEVEN ARTS Editor James Oppenheim Associate Editors Waldo Frank Van Wyck Brooks Advisory Board Kahlil Gibran Robert Frost Louis Untermeyer        Robert Edmond Jones Edna Kenton David Mannes Editorial IT is not with the intellect that we can grasp the meaning of this war. It has assumed proportions of mysterious terror and grandeur. At the beginning we saw different groups of men, vested with high power, consciously and deliberately pull the levers and release nation against nation. But in this case they have called up the hurricane which [34o] The Seven Arts in Russia already has destroyed them. Humanity may be thought of as a leashed storm, as a primitive planetary power which only most painfully, by effort of ages, has lifted up its sensitive tips of intellect, which only with insuperable difficulty has turned back upon itself, and a little controlled and guided its own destiny. Each one of us floats on the uneasy deeps of Man, and that part of us which is submerged is the sea itself, the unconscious desire and surge of humanity. Hence, however we reason about it, we find ourselves creations of the tides. Even at the moment that we are "thinking it through," that we are plotting and scheming, the resistless surge carries us away and scatters our bright talk on the winds. WE have had our century, roughly speaking, of living outside ourselves, of skimming the surface. As we turned more and more to external things, to machinery and thought, to reform and diplomacy, our emotional life thinned and threatened to disappear. It was merely that our eyes were turned away from our own depths, from our own mysterious sources in the Earth and the sun, from those needs which were wrapped up in us when the planet was a globe of misty water. But whether our intuition is warped or clear, the Unconscious of the race continues to impel us, and it needed only the shattering of our surface, to drop us again into the profound abysses of ourselves. The very hands that loosed this terrible war may have been hands of deeper impulses than their owners were aware of. They seemed in control in starting the storm, but now they stand helpless before it, unable to lay it. It gets beyond all bounds; it is like a typhoon gathering the sea of humanity into a single column of black destruction; the Earth shakes under the tread of this monster, and we little individuals protest futilely and are sucked up and whirled in the spiral. It is not War that confronts us:  it is Revolution. [341] The Seven Arts FOR some time those who listened to themselves have heard the coming of a new heaven and a new Earth. It was heard in France during the Terror: it was heard by such different spirits as Karl Marx and Nietzsche: Shelley heard it, and men of science in their laboratories have traced the faint beginnings. Blindly we spun a web of machinery around the Earth, of ships and cables, of commerce and art; dimly we released to the race discoveries about our past, and our planet, and ourselves; for selfish enough purposes we built up, as it were, a new physical body for humanity—the body of the machine. Without knowing what we were doing we made the Earth one neighborhood, the continents conversed, the races mingled, the past became the common inheritance of all. It is as if slowly we were forming the multicellular body of Man, and as if the day of Birth were drawing near: the day of Birth when Man awakes to his planetary life: when at last, by the healing of his inner conflict, by the harmonizing of his inner impulses, he shall be set free to know himself and to harness his undivided energies for the creation of himself and his world. WE can prevision little. What time it will take for this vast movement to come into realization, we do not know. But we see Russia now as that hopeful chaos, that confusion of the nebula, out of which a new world shapes itself. The Russians of all people are seen now as the appropriate beginners and pioneers—for nowhere else is there a people who are so intuitively profound, so emotionally quick. They are not held back by cleverness, and success, and organization, and intellectualism. They may listen to and be guided by those unconscious impulses which they share with humanity. And so we find that with them internationalism ceases to be a vague dream and becomes a passionate programme ; and that with them, democracy ceases to be a name for a congeries of conflicting interests and an equality of opportunity to make money, and becomes the organization of their [342] The Seven Arts lives. Whether they go through dark periods of reaction or destruction—it does not matter. In them the fire leaps which may finally fuse us. WE are riding, then, on the storm. We were born to endure the age of Great Change. We are called to suffer veritable agonies in the birth-throes of the race. We are entering into an action whose ends are different from our declared purposes, and whose developments shall sweep us into heights and abysses we thought did not exist. America, too, goes blindly into the earthquake and the hurricane, the sacrifice and the anguish. But beyond the curtain of fire, a little beyond the wall of battle-smoke, there stands waiting and radiant, Revolution. And in her arms is a little child: an inarticulate infant: the new Humanity. J. o. [343] Bernard Shaw and His Buried Treasure By Elva De Pue NO LONGER do we find psychologists carefully separating the mental faculties, as they once did, into airtight compartments, one for the will, one for the intellect, and a large drawer labeled "emotions" for the remaining unclassified forces. They are known to be inextricably bound together, emotion being simply the inside of the shield of apperception. Let us crudely visualize as a spectrum the course of development of the emotions, from the almost purely physical sensations to those processes that are nearly all mental or spiritual. In this spectrum, red symbolizes the bloody passions of the beast-man, still persisting stubbornly through the ages; the color of the illicit lamp, the color of a million sinister pools in dark and desolate trenches. Then the less heated orange and yellow feelings are those domestic or political affections and disaffections of an organizing society. Aesthetic green may stand for the fine frenzy of the artist, and poetic blue, for the ecstatic transport of the mystic. Finally, at the highest points of civilization, there are reached almost impersonal emotions: a merging of finite desires into the evolving "mind of the race," that greatest dream of the greatest men. Such is the contemplation of the beautiful by Plato, the impulse toward a Superman of Nietzsche, or the passionate absorption in his perfect world of the mathematician, described by Bertrand Russell. All these ultra-violet rays of emotion are invisible to the common eye, and the man in the street finds them impossibly recondite, or perhaps nonsensical. [344] Elva DePue Who shall judge which color is the most beautiful, or measure the comparative intensity thereof? Like heat and light, they are all forms of the same energy, capable of being transformed one into another. And every vital being must undergo emotion, whether or not it be immediately inhibited and transmuted to another plane. In the period when the red passion reigned, the expression of feeling called laughter was unknown. How did the first laugh come about? It may have been thus: Very early in our history, tribal rules began to make man inhibit his desires instead of immediately allaying them. The better behaved man, seeing one of another tribe engaged in torturing an enemy, or in some other sport that was taboo to him, went through a sympathetic nervous and muscular spasm. Then as his descendants became slightly more considerate of each other, and repressed the primitive impulses, they found relief from nervous tension in laughter, which was simply the surging up of subconscious sympathy with the ancient desires they had driven down deep into the under-mind. This is clearly shown in the way the half-civilized Elizabethans hilariously enjoyed seeing on the stage exhibitions of wholly savage cruelty. We no longer laugh at lameness and blindness on the stage, but we do at deafness. We are moved to unseemly mirth by a sudden ''damn!,\ and by half-civilized drunkenness. Nothing tickles our sensibilities so much as the discomfiture of the august, the dignified, and it is a delight to hear a simple soul blurt out what he really thinks, to the scandal of convention. Thus does our natural man come to the surface. Of course the more complex our civilization makes us, the harder it is to trace the causes of our mirth. Now for the application of all this to Bernard Shaw. The most widespread fallacy about him is that he is unnaturallv cold and void of emotion. I would like to venture the hypothesis that, on the contrary, he is, like all highly vital and sensitive natures, most susceptible to all variations of feeling, but [345] Bernard Shaw and His Buried Treasure that his powerful will enables him to control and transmute these feelings. "Shaw" and "wit" are practically synonyms. Freud in his "Wit and Its Relations to the Unconscious" seems to consider wit an evidence, like dreams, of buried wishes. So that strangely enough, Shaw's wit, on which too much stress has always been laid, is simply a by-product of the serious emotions. His introduction of humor in his most serious scenes and moments is not an indication of heartlessness, but rather of keen sensitiveness—a fear of banality or sentimentality. And by laughter the stress of feeling is relieved. Of course, the only way of proving anything about the elusive G. B. S. would be first to catch him, then to set someone like Dr. Freud at work on him. This would doubtless uncover a rich mine. An amusing and significant account of a momentary exposure of this buried treasure is given by the mine owner himself. Quotation is always necessary with him, as he is unparaphraseable and, as Chesterton complained, his compression impossible to compress. It seems that whilst emerging from a dose of ether, his "character did not come back all at once. Its artistic and sentimental side came first: its morality, its positive elements, its commonsense, its incorrigible Protestant respectability, did not return for some time. For the first time in my life I tasted the bliss of having no sense of reality to restrain me from romancing. I overflowed with what people call heart. ... I felt prepared to receive unlimited kindness from everybody with the deepest, tenderest gratitude. I was perfectly conscious of the value of my helpless, half delirious condition as a bait for sympathy; and I deliberately played for it in a manner that now makes me blush. I carefully composed effective little ravings and repeated them without an atom of shame. I called everybody by their Christian names, except one gentleman whose Christian name I did not know, and I called him 'dear old So-and-So.'   In less than an hour I was an honest taxpayer again, [346] Elva DePue with my heart perfectly well in hand. . . . Was that a gain or a loss? The problem comes home to me with special force at this moment, for I have just published some plays, and have been overwhelmed as usual by complaints of my want of heart, my unnaturally clear intellectual consciousness, my cynicism, and all the rest of it." Much of this subconscious feeling seems to have been transmuted to a fervent love of art. Like George Henry Lewes, whom Shaw says he resembles, he had a consuming desire to lift up his voice in song. The results were probably painful. They did not even satisfy him, for his intense craving was for the harmony which is "the emotional substance of music." He played over and over the pages of music in which he found poetry or drama, having no use for that part which existed ornamentally for its own sake. This shows distinctly an emotional rather than an intellectual appreciation of it. With this inherited artistic taste and sensibility, he must have been continually tortured in his early surroundings. Another cause for unhappiness was the snobbery of his family, distantly related to a baronet. But, "not to be unhappy is not to be destined to create." Therefore it is not surprising that he should have devoted himself, in a fever of indignation and outraged aesthetic feeling, to fight two things. These were poverty and "gentility." As he had seen many a brilliant Irishman worsted because of too much introspection and sensitiveness, Shaw vowed with all the strength of his will, that he would conquer his nerves and his emotions. He has confessed that for a long time public speaking made of him a pitiable coward, "nervous and self-conscious to a heart-rending degree." In spite of this, he forced himself through the torture again and again. Before he was to speak his heart beat like a recruit's going under fire for the first time—and he was no less brave. He could not see his notes for panic. He always forgot his best points, but his second best were better than most people's first best.  All the while, his bravado gave [347] Bernard Shaw and His Buried Treasure the effect of cock-sure poise. Thus does he still conceal self-consciousness by a transparent assumption of omniscience and by self-praise that is amusing in him, but which would be intolerable in anyone less magnetic and sincere. With his ability to step out of himself and look back, he can laugh at his own vanity. But it is difficult for him ever to become thoroughly indifferent. It is not for nothing that he has inscribed over his mantel:  They say-what say they? Let them say—an invaluable motto for the sensitive. He denies the charge of asceticism, affirming that on the contrary, he seeks the real joy of life. Wagner and Shelley are not called ascetics, even though they were vegetarians and drank nothing but water. With Shaw's high-strung temperament further stimulation would be unnecessary and dangerous. Why should he, with his tendency to headaches, and his delicate balance, be expected to indulge in dissipation like gross, stupid, robust men? If he did, the quality of his work would be undoubtedly impaired. Instead of following up and recording something like two per cent, of his ideas on a subject, he might then do as the average writer and consumer of alcohol, put down eighty per cent. Or he might be like some journalists, who, under the combined influence of beer, whiskey, tobacco, and beefsteak and onions, would appear to place on record more than cent per cent. In the preface to "Getting Married" he gives very forcibly his dictum on the relation of his clearness and vigor of thinking to moderation. It is on the score of his attitude toward sex love, more than anything else, that his reputation for coldness is based—because he does not consider it as important as certain other interests. The greater love, however, he places above everything: "How do you know that Love is not the greatest of all the relations?—far too great to be a personal matter." Plato and Emerson were doubtless considered "inhuman" in their time, in just the same way.   Shaw does not believe that pas- [348] Elva DePue sion can be adequately represented on the stage; the greater the passion, the more difficult is it to be acted. It is, moreover, intolerably wearying to him to see the same old subject in the theater handled in the same old way. "I found that the whole business of stage sensuousness finally disgusted me, not because I was Pharisaical or intolerantly refined, but because I was bored; and boredom is a condition which makes men as susceptible to irritation as headache makes them to noise and glare. Being a man, I have my share of the masculine silliness and vulgarity on the subject of sex, which so astonishes women, to whom sex is a serious matter. I am not an archbishop and do not pretend to pass my life on one plane or in one mood, and that the highest; on the contrary, I am, I protest, as accessible to the humors of the Rogue's Comedy or the Rake's Progress as to the pious decencies of the Sign of the Cross. Thus Falstaff, coarser than any of the men in our loosest plays, does not bore me: Doll Tearsheet, more abandoned than any of the women, does not shock me." So accustomed were the actors in London to play after play on the same subject, that when they produced the "Devil's Disciple," they made Dick appear to be in love with the silly wife of the minister, when the whole point of the play was that he was not in love with her. Shaw preferred to show the strength of a religious impulse rather than the weakness of a sex impulse, as he always does. Dick would be called cold by Shaw's critics, in spite of his tenderness for little Essie, in spite of his readiness to sacrifice himself quixotically, realizing his own detachment from the life about him. Dick says : "I can see the peace and beauty of this home: I think I have never been more at rest in my life than at this moment; and yet I know quite well I could never live here. It's not in my nature, I suppose, to be domesticated. But it's very beautiful; it's almost holy." After seeing plays about big social issues, it is not a question of morality, but of sheer ennui, if we revolt at the eternal sex [349] Bernard Shaw and His Buried Treasure play. We cease to take breathless account of whether one ordinary man does or does not marry one uninteresting woman. And after some of the "stronger" plays we have had thrust upon us, a drama by Shaw is like the cool breezes on a hilltop after the hot patchouli-scented air of a Tenderloin room. He does not want all the theaters to be "pedestals on which to set a well-dressed, well-painted woman in a strong light to please the man who is tired of the mother of sorrows and drudgery at home." He despises the thriving of the theater on the moral diseases of poor bumpkins, instead of the refining of their senses and the purging of their souls with Aristotle's cathartic. In short, he agrees with Galsworthy that "art exists not to confirm people in their tastes and prejudices, but to present them with a new vision of life." Shaw's sympathy with sympathy and hatred of selfishness (and sensuality above all other selfishness) make him rather condone women, like Mrs. George, who give themselves generously while seeking a high sort of love. Candida and Leo are examples of women who begin to have room in their hearts to feel affection and interest for more than one person. His characters are never the ordinary stage "sympathetic" type; they are mixed of good and bad. What can be more pitiable and tender than the plea for the "old grouch"? "Think of the people who do kind things in an unkind way—people whose touch hurts, whose voices jar, whose tempers play them false, who wound and worry the people they love in the very act of trying to conciliate them, and yet who need affection as much as the rest of us." Shaw's repressed poetry escapes notably in Mrs. George's trance scene, in Caesar's apostrophe to the Sphinx, and above all, in the final poignant speech of the mystic Keegan. But after such outbursts, the poet seizes his heart again in a firm grip. No one can call him restrained and cool in his criticism. He insists that he is usually biased; furthermore he advocates unfairness, combined with feeling, as superior to attempts at [35o] Elva DePue cold judgment. When he is called unjust, he carefully explains he is not God Almighty. "Whoever has been through the experience of discussing criticism with a thorough, perfect, and entire ASS, has been told that criticism should be above all things free from personal feeling!" This peculiar attitude of his toward criticism should be strictly kept in mind in reading his remarks about the war. He says he is not fair; why should anyone expect an absolutely impartial dictum? Of that later. His slightest articles about unimportant plays live, because they are not only keen, even if prejudiced, diagnoses, but also the expression of a boundless vitality which connects them up with life. Lewes wrote that "minds of deep emotive sensibility are apt to be pained, even exasperated by scientific explanations which decline the imaginary aid of some incomprehensible outlying agency not expressible in terms of experience." In this way is Shaw's mind exasperated to the boiling point by the arguments of scientists (especially those of the medical profession) made entirely in empirical terms. He violently thrusts aside all their statistics. He says that mathematics is only a concept to him. He attacks the changing theories of inoculation so bitterly that one is half convinced that he has really uncovered a horrible and wholesale conspiracy against the simple, defenceless layman! And when it comes to vivisection, we find he has a real pity for "brother beast," in spite of Chesterton's argument that he disliked dead animals more than he liked live ones. In his crusade against using animals for experimentation, he goes so far as to say: "If you cannot attain knowledge without torturing a dog, you must do without knowledge." The epithet of Shaw's most extreme scorn and disgust is "Chicago meat packer," by which he seems to mean a symposium of brutal killing, overbearing capitalism, ignorant unaesthetic vulgarity, and blind greed for money. In spite of his anti-romanticism, we see that he has much in common with the greatest romanticists, Shelley and Wagner, [351] Bernard Shaw and His Buried Treasure whom he profoundly admires. It is the poetry, not the prose of science, that he. accepts. His central philosophy is the belief in life's continual effort not only to maintain itself, but to achieve higher and higher organization and completer self-consciousness. Just as the physical eye was evolved, so now is evolving a mind's eye that shall see the purpose of life, and enable the individual to work for that instead of thwarting the purpose by setting up short-sighted personal aims as at present. His remark in "Man and Superman" is fearfully applicable to the world today: "Think of how life wastes and scatters itself, how it raises up obstacles to itself and destroys itself in its ignorance and blindness. It needs a brain, this irresistible force, lest in its ignorance it should resist itself." This fine thinking is the result of learning in his youth to look the bitterest facts in the face; of learning to steel himself against romance, the "dreaming, dreaming, the torturing, heart scalding, never-satisfying dreaming—the imagination that makes him unable to face reality, nor deal with it, nor handle it, nor conquer it" of his many unfortunate countrymen. He did live in his imagination when he was a boy; and he knows whereof he speaks. An Irish priest once told Chesterton that there was in his people a fear of the passions older than Christianity. Archer says: "I suspect Shaw of being constitutionally an arrant sentimentalist, whose abhorrence of sentiment is as the shrinking of the dipsomaniac from the single drop of alcohol that he knows will make his craving ungovernable." The downfall of many an airy Utopian castle during Shaw's furious hunt through them for social remedies has not dismayed him nor yet cooled his ardor. His sympathy with the unfit (however they may irritate him) makes him "opposed to the cosmic process" whenever it seems to contradict the higher laws of altruism. Because his humanitarian instincts are revolted by the doctrine of the "survival of the fittest," he refuses to have it applied to the human race. [352] Elva DePue But still more opposed is he to the terrible survival of the unfittest promised by the war. For his outspoken opinions since nineteen fourteen he has been reviled and misunderstood more than ever; as his passionate sincerity and his terrific effort to counteract what he felt was the stupidest of jingoism made him exaggerate the facts somewhat. However, it cannot be denied that his view is always the broader one, even when he is carried away by loathing of the calamity, and a madness of regret for the waste, pain, and sorrow in its train. Since the setting up of the barrier through which nations see each other, as through a red glass, darkly, only a few of the tallest heads have been high enough to look over it, and envisage the other side as before. To the multitude traitorous and incomprehensible, Shaw is censored and Russell is chained, at a time when there is the most crying need of men of sane vision. What would you have? Would you have Shaw repudiate all his former opinions, turn inside out, and sing blatantly with the mob, like a cowardly liar, "I am a British patriot?" Instead of stultifying his intelligence by futile imprecations against the Kaiser, he is trying, in spite of the chaos, to see some faint hope of order coming out of it. Instead of imitating those who are saying honeyed things about what they once called "barbarous" Russia, because of the artificial alliance, he is trying to see Russia's place in the future. He hates English Junkerism no less than "Potsdamnation" and Pots-damnation no more than Russian oppression. Like Romain Rolland, he sees that it is Imperialism that brought on the trouble, and that it is Imperialism that should be attacked. The enemy, says Rolland, is not across the frontiers. This enemy is Imperialism, and dwells within every country, and not one nation has the manhood to fight it. This Imperialism, the thousand-headed monster, whatever its form, whether military, financial, feudal, republican, social or spiritual, will be swept out of existence by the people at the end by the device of [353] Bernard Shaw and His Buried Treasure Voltaire. To Shaw also the war is simply a continuation of the wrongs due to the present form of society, for from the capitalistic class are taken the governmental officials who wanted war, and by this class are controlled the newspapers that spread the contagion of war fever among the masses. You cannot expect an Irishman who has read English history and who has used his keen eyes in Ireland, to be impressed by the chivalrous posing about "honor" and to relish big talk about small nations. "Honor" to him is an empty term used by simpletons to avoid thought. It was "honor" in Sparta to expose your baby daughter; it was "honor" in France to stick a rapier into the lung of your friend who let fall a few hasty words; it is "honor" now to sing "my country right or wrong" and incite men to continue the general massacre because you are afraid of being unpopular if you say anything else. It is only those dull, ignorant minds entirely lacking imagination or visualizing power that talk about the "invigoration and manliness" of this vile, brutalizing, unclean, mechanical warfare. It is almost unbearable torture for an all-embracing beautifully poised imagination like Shaw's to contemplate it. To him as to poor Mr. Britling, with his atlas and his imperfect God, the only possible escape from sure screaming insanity in face of facts, is to be bent, "not on revenge, nor gallantry, nor pride, nor glory, nor any of the invidiousnesses of patriotism, but on the problem of how so to redraw the map of Europe and reform its political constitution that this abominable crime and atrocious nuisance shall not occur again." To Shaw with his dramatist's ability to see from all points of view, as a man might look from several windows in a tower, to the north, to the east, to the south, there is no "other side." As Jesus said, "He that loveth father and mother more than me, is not worthy of me," so Shaw says, "He that loves his own' country, his own' home selfishly, more than humanity, he is not worthy of the nobler humanity that is to be."  In the [354] Elva DePue spirit that Jesus asked: "Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? They that do the will of my father, they are my brethren," so Shaw asks, "Who are my countrymen? They that believe in Life, not in Death." His wonderful sense of order and economy, which is at the bottom of all science and all great art, makes him unwilling to waste even his feelings. He has proved that by the will, emotion may be subjugated and transformed, and that it is the will which is the key to all action; that the real motive power of our acts is deep in the will itself, and that conventions such as "duty" serve simply as ex post facto excuses. His passion is that which he attributes to Ibsen's Rebecca: "The cold passion of the North—that essentially human passion which embodies itself in objective purposes and interests, and in attachments which again embody themselves in objective purposes and interests on behalf of others—that fruitful, contained, governed, instinctively utilized passion which makes nations and individuals great, as distinguished from the explosive, hysterical, wasteful passion which makes nothing but a scene" —or a war. So in him, will, emotion, and intellect are inseparable. His intellect is a marvelously fashioned tool, a machine which is galvanized by the current of feeling generated by his powerful subconscious battery. [355] Valedictory to a Theatrical Season By Waldo Frank AT a time when the hope of future health and life seems to be the sole survivor from the bankruptcy of the present, one may be expected to carry a searching attitude even into the theater. For the stage is a mighty mirror in which the audience stands forth, sharply and faithfully reflected. The audience is a vague and shifting creature. But the mirror is magic. It draws out characteristic line and essence; it gives an image that may be understood. And even the audience somehow knows this, since it has come into existence chiefly through the curiosity to see itself. This dweller in the theater explains our peculiar interest in it at such times as these : but it explains as well the conservatism of the dramatic art. You cannot expect a people to change greatly from one season to the next. You cannot expect an art whose prime ingredient is the whole human family to perform nimble somersaults like an individual. Changes in the theater are likely to be slow and ponderous and painful. But they are none the less true and fundamental. And the image in the mirror, despite its economy of line and space, lays bare those subtle divergences of form which herald the coming of the new. The usual features of the American Show have of course not been absent, this last season. But they may safely be assumed and put aside. They are the old relatives—the suffered elders of a passing generation—who knit harmlessly by the hearth while the world jogs past them. They have many names—hallowed names: the old-fashioned melodrama, the [356] Waldo Frank old-fashioned comedy-with-music, the Victorian plot-play in new-fangled dress sacred to the memory of men like Charles Klein, George Broadhurst and Augustus Thomas. In their true form, they are good, proper, senile members of a group that is perhaps rightly fond of them. And for the critic to judge them harshly is simply to be inhumane. Their decrepitude, however, has become obvious in the frantic disguises that accompany their appearance. They no longer satisfy, and they must soon be gone. If a new breed of vital, blustering plays is indeed crowding upwards to replace them, we have no reason for concern. Our interest should therefore rightly be directed to whatever variants and changes we can find today in the American Show. However vaguely, they tell the tale of what is coming next. What, then, is emerging from our doddering dramatic past? In what transfigured form is the conflict of our life rising on the popular and native scene? Love, ambition, faith and sacrifice—all the true coinage of the theater—must surely be in process of reminting to meet the reality of the millions who, when they are not at the American show, are helping to build the American nation. Plenty of such evolving signs do indeed exist. Let us have a look at them, as they appeared in the past season. . . . The musical play is the plutocrat of our stage. It is, if anything, rather too nakedly devoted to the fantasies of love. Its burstings of song, its assorted and sentimental capers are all, in the last analysis, gay documents of this emotion. It is therefore significant to note that in the latest tune-comedies of Broadway the straightforward love-motif is dwindling; and that when it does appear, it seems somehow to have done so only after a struggle that tortured its forms and warped its directions into strange by-ways. Ugly and unnatural unions, the exchange of the traditional attributes of each sex to the other and the use of clown brutality with clear erotic sources are among our recent contributions to the theme of love. [357] Valedictory to a Theatrical Season New types of characters are springing up to represent these contributions. Huge and aggressive women-clowns trumpet about with violent intent on the pretty-boy heroes of the cast. And these heroes display an up-to-date reluctance to making love. Their favorite posture is that of the pursued. The new heroines have a liking for the fat, brute comedians who smirk over their advances and then knock them down. And only when the dainty hero, escaping the seduction of the powerful clown-woman, is at last inspired to beat the heroine, does he convince and win her. Some acute vagary of popular demand is supplying a bumper crop of women with the physical appeal of boys, and of men who act like women. On all sides, the theme of love emerges as if from some impalpable barrier whose repressive power twists it into abnormal guises. In one musical play, this inhibiting force makes its appearance openly in the plot: there is the usual repulsive and disappointed woman-clown—an aunt, this time—and a young couple forbidden by the contract of their marriage from kissing and holding hands. Perhaps a hint of our future there stood prettily dramatized before us. This curious deformity is not absent in the "movies." Charles Chaplin is an extremely brilliant clown, but he is also an unhealthy one. I recall one film of his in which a series of flirtations turned with invariable emphasis into a physical encounter, a physical upset and a drubbing of the female. The clown-trade has always honored the fisticuff and the blow. But in its contemporary mood, these blows are with sinister frequency directed against women. The modern caper is for the comedian to lunge for the man, who dodges, and so fell the lady. Indeed, violence to women and violence by women are among the spreading laugh-winners of the new American show. The beset, effeminate manling of the musical stage makes his re-appearance, a bit galvanized and considerably funnier, as the most popular figure of the screen. And more and more, the fun-provoking tricks of our [358] Waldo Frank plays have come to be based on deformities of the impulse and the human role which, in the past, were protected—rather than attacked—by the comic genius. Classic comedy employed the deformative technique to a deliberate social end. Harpagon and Tartuffe were its typical victims. Personalities that in themselves presented deformities of impulse became the creatures of grotesque. The healthy social will played the avenger. So we found laughter directed against the miser and the hypocrite, the tyrant father and the stupid husband. Today, we find it shafted against the lover, the man and the woman. There were old taboos against crabbed parents, false priests, unsocial plutocrats. If the psychology of caricature is indeed criticism, there seem to be new taboos against healthy men and healthy women. A fine respect for untrammeled love and for the impertinences of youth molded the comedy of Terence, of Molière and Marivaux, of Congreve and Bernard Shaw. Can it be that some subtle resistance to these same blossomings of life qualifies the comedy of today? The puny cavaliers, the fool-ministers, the astringent heroines and the raping duennas that cavort increasingly in our musical and "movie" farces would suggest something of the sort. Of course, the chief companion of the farce in the American show is the play of thrills—the melodrama. So close do these two forms run together that they are often merged into a unit—the new dramatic cocktail of which "Seven Keys to Baldpate" was an eminent and perhaps classical example. Between these blatant and unregenerate extremes, we leave no room for the subtler growths. The American show is indifferent alike to that refining of laughter into smile which makes for comedy, and to the elevation of shock into impression which denotes tragedy. But if the melo is generically old, our contemporary masters have managed to reflect within it, as in the farce, the gradual evolving of something new. We have seen how in our so-called comedies a set of acidulous [359] Valedictory to a Theatrical Season and denatured substitutes is being brewed in place of the no longer filling love-theme. We may observe as well how in the so-called "drama," the traditional labels of nobility, sacrifice, duty and passion are put to situations so hideously false that one salty touch of irony would alone be needed to make them Swiftian satire. Let us analyze a typical example—taken from the films: We find a father zealous for his "family honor" and two sons. The married son falls in love with an actress. His father turns him out for his faithless crime. The unmarried son, who is the hero, goes to the actress to bully her into loosing her hold. He falls in love with her, himself. Since he is the hero, however, she is forthwith transmogrified from villainess to heroine. In order to cure the other married brother of his unhappy love, she—with bleeding heart—plays the drunkard and the flirt at a dinner to which she has taken him for this simple purpose. The fallen young man, in consequence of this act of heroism, robs his father's safe and loses the money at cards. The cad who wins the money breaks into the actress' home and tries to buy her with his spoil. The hero emerges from a canopy, throws out the cad, first pocketing the ill-gotten money. Meantime, the father discovers the theft, goes to the wicked son, places a pistol in his hand and tries to make him shoot himself for the family honor. After a harrowing struggle, with the father's hand clenched over his son's, and the pistol at the latter's throat, the hero, his actress-love and the other's wife break through the door. The hero advances to the battling pair and says: "I stole the money" and pulls the wad of bills from his pocket. The thief-son, fully satisfied, falls into his father's arms, forgiven: is gathered up by his neglected wife, forgiven again: and the actress is straightway added to the family honor as a new daughter-in-law. . . . Now, in this drama, which doubtless reads like a burlesque, there are many of the old clear-labelled properties of the the- [360] Waldo Frank ater: among them, family honor, love, self-sacrifice by the hero, self-humiliation by the heroine in feigning wickedness, repentance, reconciliation, and the Cornelian immolation of the sinful son by the stoic father. But to confound these situations with their authentic namesakes in "Horace," "La Dame aux Camélias," "David Garrick," etc., is to misprize them. They are decompositions of old material: and it is precisely for this reason that we can find in them the germs of something new—the elements of change that have brought about disintegration. We may not enjoy the old melodrama. We may not believe in right and wrong and duty as the hero bandies the terms about. But it is plain that the old audiences did. Their attitude was the major premise: and resting on it, the inner structure of the play had a true, artistic logic. The very fact that the people were in earnest imposed upon the playwright the need of making his drama somewhat water-tight, somewhat conclusive. He had the conviction of his hearers to reckon with, and any too gross perversion of reality, in casting doubt upon the subject of their conviction, would have rebounded on himself. A too unlikely play about "chastity," for instance, must immediately have slurred the concept of chastity itself, as the play limned it forth, and so have become intolerable to the crowds. Their staunch belief compelled the favor-seeking dramatist to construct a dramatic likeness for his story; and from this, in turn, the belief of the audience stood forth reflected. It is plain, however, that in a concoction like the one described, no such logic exists. The hero who steps up with "I stole the money" is not incurring, even for the moment, the mental and physical consequences of his act. He is therefore not sacrificing himself. His self-accusation brings on none of the reactions, subjective or environmental, that go toward even the most naive illusion. The behavior of the guilty brother, who by virtue of this isolated lie falls into his father's loving arms, lacks all relativity [361] Valedictory to a Theatrical Season with what surrounds it. Indeed, each one of these situations is in a vacuum, is denuded of any of the circumstances of the real, is a label on an empty bottle. Taking them together, one finds that there is psychic divorce between them and that the emotions nominally evoked lack any integration with the actions nominally pictured. They are indeed joined together by no power more subtle or more true than the camera itself. The influence of the camera-art has been to speed this disintegrating process. The two-dimensional scene runs one into the next with far greater fluency, far less resistance than was possible with the three-dimensional structure of the stage. All of the tricks of the "movies" encourage the false dramatic logic which we have considered. Its freedom of shifting scenes and character-perspectives: its power of imposing one independent picture upon the other: its license of time and place and its illusory triumphs over nature, play their part. But a mechanical means could do no more than foster an integral condition. The deterioration of the art was there. Had it not been, the present status of the "movie" would have proved intolerable, and a popular industry must have developed otherwise. Screen technique simply took advantage of a latent tendency and, with its greater power to fulfill it, gained the prestige that today makes the motion-picture our most satisfying, most gripping and most expressive art. The same extremes of mock feeling and mock action run through the whole welter of our plays. They are exaggerated on the screen, but they are not wanting in the farces, the comedies and the farce-dramas. Everywhere in our theater, there is this growing rigmarole of unreal and unrelated action. One is therefore driven to conclude that behind must be a like mass of unreal emotion. For any feeling that exists basally, if only in the tradition of a crowd, will flower in action—and in action that is emotionally determined. These current adulterations of love, virtue, honor, are bearable to the onlooker only on the theory that he no longer fundamentally believes [362] Waldo Frank in them. If he did, such parodies of his belief would turn his stomach and inspire his wrath. But the contemporary spectacle touches alone the periphery of consciousness and to this surface the true impulses of life have somehow been unable to attain. For a reason, then, the normal interplay of men and women, in so far as it is imaged in the American show, seems to be tortured and ill-at-ease and dwindling. And the reason is not far to seek, in our contemporary American life. The canons of art, as well as the canons of right and wrong which we brought with us from abroad, are alien and inadequate in our new complex world. They have power merely to obstruct its birth. America is trying to grow up through a dump-heap of discarded customs and ideas. And the maladies of its discomfort crop out in thwarted and perverted forms. The expressions of the old no longer satisfy; but the nay-saying forces behind them can blight each fresh sprout of growth as it appears. The new fate of the love-theme is a case in point. The Puritan taboos are heavy on us; but the need is strong for freer imagery than the magistrates allow. America, thank God! has none of the domestic adaptability of the Anglo-Saxon to his own commandments. So the love-theme breaks its barrier in perverted forms; and the neurotic, auto-erotic "show" is the result. The credentialed beliefs in what is virtue no longer fit the free confusion of our lives. But they are still traditionally in force, and any effort to replace them is still cried-out upon by the proper forums of the nation. The dramatic parodies we have examined rise from our suppressed indifference—an indifference which most of us would of course deny and which is evident only in such deflected acts as these. Everywhere the bars are clamped against the dawning drama of populous America. The need of vicarious experience bursts forth in disguised versions of our present life; or else it is driven back into innocuous and romantic pasts. Per- [363] Valedictory to a Theatrical Season haps the truest contributions of the motion-picture are these simple epics of the American fable. Pioneer California, Alaska and the Civil War become pastures for our hunger. Several splendid expressions have sprung from this one unhindered field. Of course, the folk-epic belongs to the childhood of a nation. When vision faces forward, when analysis and the stern grappling with the future become the business of dreams, the epic falls away. Its fabular simplicity no longer holds; its past paradise is pale before the adventure to come. But our spirit may not encounter its present and its future. Its healthiest dramatic course is therefore backward. Film-plays like "The Birth of a Nation," "The Barrier," "A Romance of the Redwoods," are true epics, rich in primitive sincerity and full of the fervor of the folk-dream. They belong to an epoch in the American drama in which the repressive forces of a transplanted culture drove the popular imagination back to the more obvious borders and the more easy conquests. The spectacle that recently gripped the multitudes at the Uptown Tabernacle of Mr. Billy Sunday belongs generally to the American show and specifically to the past theatrical season. It would be worth while to trace the analogues of method between Mr. Sunday's sermons and the musical comedy: to show how in each, song and dance and clownery are strung along an extraneous and irrational theme. There is no room, here, for such details. But it must be plain that no people emotionally anchored to the sources of their life, and on good terms with the impulses which must shape its future, would tolerate this man's adulterated wares. If we study Billy Sunday—study his ideas, his gestures, his illustrations—we will find that they are composed of substitutes for forbidden fruit quite like the substitutes that in the theater pass for the human emotions. It might surprise even so hardened a sinner as Mr. Sunday to learn that when, in "ripping the dance from hell to break- [364] Waldo Frank fast" he springs from floor to ceiling, he is releasing in a distorted symbol precisely the energy that the dance smoothly and harmoniously clothes: and that his audience are enjoying his graphic condemnation of the dance with the same senses, however twisted, that make them enjoy dancing on the stage. When Mr. Sunday curses the drinker, he is furnishing in his excess verbiage a substitute for the excess of alcohol. When he loses his temper with Satan, he is venting the bile, the anger, the ugly passion that Satan typifies. And when he howls at his hearers to stop frequenting the brothel and the saloon, he gives them, in his brutal illustrations, an at least temporary satisfaction in place of the vices he decries. The success of Billy Sunday is due to his use of what, in pathology, is known as the conversion-mechanism: — the channeling of an instinctive desire away from an expression that is forbidden to one that is disguised and not forbidden. It is unsafe to give open leash to sexuality, so turn the passion into the fear of Hell and glut your worry by "hitting the trail." It is uneconomic to get drunk on alcohol, so wave a flag and get drunk on God. It may be natural to lose your temper with your brother, but it is less dangerous to get mad at the devil. Such is his method. And one need only remark the constantly recurring wreath of smile on the terrier-like countenance of Mr. Sunday to realize what good fun it is to have his sort of "religion" in a materialistic and fun-denying world. The neurotic satisfies himself with a set of distorted symptoms in place of an unfriendly and hard reality. So Mr. Sunday's preachments. They are, like the other shows we have considered, full of blandishing and adulterated goods fashioned to take the place of forbidden life. Their source, as well, is the denial of life and the mistrusting of experience. In place of the dance, contortion: in place of pleasure, the frenzy of the dervish: in place of adventure, the back-trail down to childhood: in place of revolt, profanity: in place of God, an old exhorter with a whip : in place of life, a dark cell [365] Valedictory to a Theatrical Season with a barred window. In this way does the American show neglect the possible glad future of American life. It would be well for our intellectual and social pontiffs to know their part in it. Nor must the established churches and the gentle churchmen who brought Mr. Sunday to New York with a suffering sense of being practical, escape the ironic justice of their act. This jaundiced dullard is the logical outcome of their own growth-denying methods. The stragetic positions are all with the moribund attitude toward life. School and university, magazine and journal, church and government are the thrones of the obsolescent and about-to-be-discarded. No peaceful means of change seems to exist between the last transplanted European generation and the first fledglings of a new America. The insurgency stills foams at the feet of the world. So, although their sun is setting, the debilitated forces can still dictate terms and canons of forbiddence. They can keep the untrained and unorganized stirrings of youthful America from a conscious right-of-way into knowledge and expression. They can still send a reluctant people into fratricidal war with the false persuasion of their "laws," their "duty" and their patriotism." This is the climax of their sinister power. But their peace also has its atrocities. And among them is this spectacle of an uneasy populace, yearning for what is denied it and turning to poisoned substitutes for art. The historian will not have to look to the recent acts of Congress to understand the present danger of America. He will find no clearer picture of our condition than within the mirror of the stage. For there, we are revealed as a vast creature uttering platitudes when unperturbed, and going off into stammerings and tics when something deep in us seeks utterance. The elders block the way to growth and to expression. They do this not because they are vicious or stronger, but because they happened to be there first—and are entrenched. [366] Waldo Frank They must be thrust aside. Their rules are of course designed for their own preservation. And the method of their instinctive fight is to deny liberty of feeling and the resources of life to the rising multitude whose ascendency means their death. [367] Two Views of Ragtime I. A  Modest Proposal By Hiram Kelly Moderwell THERE is a large professional class in this country devoted to the business of complaining that American music is given no recognition. It has been estimated that the food which this class consumes would support a whole army corps in the trenches and that its hats, if placed end to end, would reach from the Battery to the Bronx. How accurate these estimates are I cannot say, but it is certain that the complaint, which was articulate ten years ago, has diminished not a bit up to the present day. It is astonishing how little imagination, how little courage, this class can show. They have neither a sense of advertising values nor an appreciation of musical history. They beg a patriotic recognition for works quite lacking in distinction, and ignore all the original music that exists in this country. Some time ago a singer (she was not of the class mentioned) asked me to suggest some typical American songs for her programmes. She had done valuable service in introducing to American audiences the folk-music and the newer songs of Russia, and was going abroad to perform a reciprocal service for America. She was to appear before audiences quite ignorant of American music and eager for new and vivid impressions. I suggested a group of the best ragtime songs. She thought I was trying to be funny. To the professional American musicians, ragtime simply does not exist. They give it no more recognition than if it were the beating of tom-toms outside a side-show.  Not recog- [368] Hiram Kelly Moderwell nizing its existence they cannot distinguish the better from the worse. Because most of the ragtime pieces they hear are feeble (as Heaven knows most American music is feeble) they lump the whole art in one and call it "vicious" or "vulgar." What an argument they use against themselves in that word "vulgar" they never guess. It is an old thought to most of us that the art of the vulgus, the people, is the material for national expression. Dante, creating his "Divine Comedy" from the vulgar language, Balakirefï creating a national school of music from the vulgar songs, are classic instances. The despised and rejected of today becomes the accepted of another generation. But even this analogy does not tempt the patriotic American musician to open his ears to the vulgar music of his land and age. Such distinguished visitors as Ernest Bloch and Percy Grainger are delighted and impressed by American ragtime; foreign peoples accord it a jolly respect. Only the native-born, foreign-educated musician scorns and deplores it. Admittedly the greater part of ragtime music is pretty bad. But this is only to say that the greater part of current production in any art is weak and inferior. The prevailing snap-judgment concerning ragtime is false not only because it judges the whole from the average, but also (and more particularly) because it overlooks the peculiar qualities of the thing it judges. Any reviewer of music (commonly called a "critic") knows that not more than one-third of his business is to appraise or "criticize." The other two-thirds is to report and describe. If he hears a concert in which certain new and significant music is badly played, he does not dismiss it by saying that "yesterday's concert was a bad one." His "story" is in the fact that new and important music has had its first performance; the quality of the performance is of secondary importance. If he misses the real "story" he has "fallen down on his assignment." And I charge that the professional American musician has fallen down on his assignment in fail- [369] Two Views of Ragtime ing to recognize where the story lies in American popular music. He has failed to recognize that ragtime is a certain sort of music; he has failed to perceive what in ragtime is new, distinctive, expressive, possibly creative. He has judged without knowing what he is judging. Being unable to report, in good newspaper fashion, the elements of news in his story, he is quite unable to separate the better from the worse, the significant from the imitative. There is, of course, plenty of room for difference of opinion as to the musical value of ragtime; it may be as feeble as its enemies charge. But we shall not accept the judgment of one who does not know properly what he is judging. To me ragtime brings a type of musical experience which I can find in no other music. I find something Nietzschean in its implicit philosophy that all the world's a dance. I love the delicacy of its inner rhythms and the largeness of its rhythmic sweeps. I like to think that it is the perfect expression of the American city, with its restless bustle and motion, its multitude of unrelated details, and its underlying rhythmic progress toward a vague Somewhere. Its technical resourcefulness continually surprises me, and its melodies, at their best, delight me. The whole emotion is one of keen and carefree enjoyment of the present. In ragtime's own language, I find ragtime "simply grand." This is the feeling of one individual—one who was educated on Haydn, Beethoven and Mendelssohn. It doesn't count for much as a judgment unless a great number of other persons, similarly educated on Haydn, Beethoven and Mendelssohn, agree. But how shall they agree, except they hear? How shall they feel the musical vitality of ragtime unless the musician separates the art from the bluster and noise that surrounds it? If I am at all right in my judgment, ragtime will stand the test of the concert hall. And this is just what I am proposing—a ragtime song recital. It is not enough to admit that ragtime is "good in its place."   Ragtime should stand [370] Hiram Kelly Moderwell being brought out of the café just as well as folk-music stands being brought out from "behind the cows." I firmly believe that a ragtime programme, well organized and well sung, would be delightful and stimulating to the best audience the community could muster. But is there enough courage in the whole singing profession to make the experiment? I doubt it. The very idea strikes terror in the average singer. To face an audience with an evening of trash! The average singer's mind is pigeon-holed more than that of the most rigid theologian. The whole of musical literature is for him divided into classifications, and what is not in them does not exist. The genius to trace music to its lair, to find and reveal, is not taught in the schools. The singer has learned how Mozart should be sung, or Schubert, or Strauss. He knows that ragtime sung this way would be vanity, futility. Therefore he cannot sing ragtime. At the most he supposes that ragtime must be sung with the "vaudeville technique." But no particular technique is needed. There are only two kinds of singing: good and bad. Ragtime must be well sung, that is all. By this I mean merely that the notes must be sung as they are written, with pure tones and natural phrasing. The singer who has the technique to do this, and the courage to attempt ragtime in public, will hardly fail to catch the special features of the music. But first of all he must treat his music with complete respect. He must accord it at least as much respect as he would give to any of those dreary "art-songs" that proceed by the dozen from the imitative pens of our recognized American composers. With a reasonable amount of technical equipment, courage, and seriousness, I feel that I can guarantee him a success. The musician will reply, with some justice, that ragtime is distinctive only in its rhythm, and that the melody, where it is not conventional, is banal. Certainly the average ragtime tune is not a thing to be heard a second time, and the [371] Two Views of Ragtime best falls short of the rhythm in originality. But exactly the same charge could be levelled at the impressionistic "art songs" of the last fifteen years. Their originality has resided in the harmony of their accompaniments; as melody they were nearly always undistinguished. This was not essential to the style any more than in the case of ragtime; the voice part might well be better, and preferably would be. But the songs as units were beautiful and distinctive and as such were justified. The same can be said for the best of ragtime. Then, too, by a careful process of selection, the singer can discover many charming melodies. (Personally, I consider Irving Berlin the most creative melodist in America today.) Moreover, it is not true that ragtime is distinguished only by its rhythm. No mere rhythmic formula is capable of creating a tradition in music. No technical definition can enclose the ragtime tradition, or even its rhythmic formula. For about this tradition there have grown accretions of formulae, melodic, harmonic and rhythmic, which have made American ragtime distinct from any other popular music in the world. All these, taken together with the animating spirit (how shall we describe that spirit except to call it the Rag?) make ragtime. But the singer may reply that though the music be worth the experiment, the "lyrics" are impossible; to offer songs sung in the slang of the streets would be too much. Here I simply can't agree. Since when has the dialect song been ruled out of the concert hall? What futuristic critic has decreed that nonsense words are improper to folk-song and popular poetry? These lyrics are good just in so far as they are characteristic and eloquent of the people whom they express, and I am sure that the singer need not go far to discover verses that are aglow with the life and imagery of the Mississippi Negro or the Sixth Avenue clerk. He will find characteristic verse of a high order in The Memphis Blues or Roll dem Cotton Bales.   But take the poetry of Sixth Avenue at its bald- [372] Hiram Kelly Moderwell est; then take the poetry of the American "art-song" as it appears in hundreds of forms: and ask yourself which one a supposedly healthy people must prefer: "How many times do I love thee, dear? Tell me how many thoughts there be In the atmosphere Of a new-fallen year, Whose white and sable hours appear The latest flake of Eternity; So many times do I love thee, dear." * With this lyric in praise of love, contrast the following, in praise of the grand piano: "When a green Tetrazine starts to warble, I grow cold as an old piece of marble, I allude to the crude little party singer Who don't know when to pause." Why should the self-respecting singer be ashamed to sing the dialect of Sixth Avenue any more than the dialect of Kipling's English Tommy? Is a dialect "literature" when its home is across the ocean, and "vulgarity" when its home is around the corner? The professional singer might, however, mistrust a ragtime programme on the score of monotony. Ragtime is, after all, but a single rhythm and expresses, in general, but a single mood—that of care-free happiness. But the monotony resides more on the surface, and in the conventional methods of playing ragtime, than in the literature of ragtime as the singer has it spread out before him. From the most furious allegro, down to the gentlest allegretto, its rhythms include all nuances of tempo. Among the various "blues" there are even andante movements, in which the rag is no more than the ripple on the surface of the placid water. The rag of Broadway ranges from boisterous merrymaking to insinuating sensuality, but the Negro has extended the rhythm to express moods of pathos and homesickness. Musicians have generally failed to recognize how flexible and adaptable the rag rhythm is. * Out of courtesy I suppress the names of author and composer. [373] Two Views of Ragtime But if the singer is afraid of a monotonous effect from a programme composed solely of the Broadway rags, let him add a group of various "recital songs" in ragtime, and another of Negro spirituals representing the origin of the rhythm, and the American folk-song at its purest. With these groups he would have a programme of the utmost variety of mood and manner, representing in a single evening almost the sole germinal originality in America's contribution to the musical literature of the world. Here is a specimen programme for such a recital. It has been selected almost at random. Better ones can doubtless be made, and many others equally good could be formed without duplicating a single song. Probably some re-arrangement would be needed in the accompaniment, since our popular songs are invariably designed for a moderate technical ability in the pianist. The piano parts could be amplified, varied and enriched without falsifying the song. Needless to say, the pianist, as well as the singer, would need to be an artist. This programme I hereby offer to any singer who has the courage to use it: I "Roll dem Cotton Bales"...........................Johnson "Waiting for the Robert E. Lee"......................Muir "The Tennessee Blues".............................Warner "The Memphis Blues"...............................Handy II "You May Bury Me in the East"..................Traditional "Bendin' Knees a-Achin' "........................Traditional "These Dead Bones Shall Rise Again".............Traditional "Play on Your Harp, Little David"...............Traditional III "Nobody's Lookin' But the Owl and the Moon"........Johnson Exhortation ........................................Cook Rain Song..........................................Cook IV "Everybody's Doing It".............................Berlin "I Love a Piano"...................................Berlin "When I Get Back to the U. S. A."....................Berlin "On the Beach at Wa-ki-ki"........................Kern "Ragtime Cowboy Joe"...............................Muir [374] Hiram Kellv Moderwell The first group comprises four characteristic songs of Negro life as picturesque and as beautiful as any group of Kipling Tommy songs that could be devised. It ends with a song which is nothing short of a masterpiece. In sheer melodic beauty, in the vividness of its characterization, in the deftness of its polyphony and structure, this song deserves to rank among the best of our time. In the second group are four songs, apparently of purely traditional origin, which are well-nigh equal in beauty and intensity of feeling to any similar group that could be put together from the folk-songs of any nation. Of the songs of the third group two are well known on the concert stage and the third must be regarded as one of the most artistic ''popular songs'' of the last fifteen years. All three offer abundant opportunity to the capable singer. The last group is "pure Broadway." From the strictly musical point of view I should not say a great deal in their favor, though the first and the fourth are certainly better, less "vulgar," in melody than most of the current songs which appear on AEolian Hall programmes. The third suggests an interesting side-current—ragtime counterpoint. The last is nothing but a trick song, musically quite negligible, but so filled with the energy of the American street that it fully deserves a place on an American programme. All the songs of the last group, I imagine, would be sung with a broad grin on the singer's face. There was a grin in the souls of the city folk who first gave them currency, and there is a grin in the spirit of this one American art which, thank Heaven, does not take itself too seriously. I feel quite convinced that a European audience would welcome this programme with enthusiasm. Whether Americans would take to it kindly is perhaps a matter for doubt. The Americans are incurable nouveaux and are perhaps ashamed to recognize their humble beginnings. But here and nowhere else are the beginnings of American music, if American music is to be anything but a pleasing reflection of [375] Two Views of Ragtime Europe. Here is the only original and characteristic music America has produced thus far. Whether it can be made the basis for a national school of composition as great as the Russian I do not know. But I know that there will be no great American music so long as American musicians despise our ragtime. The very frame of mind which scorns it is sterile. When an AEolian Hall public applauds this programme of ragtime, then I shall expect to hear of great American symphonies. II. Ragtime and American Music By Charles L. Buchanan PERHAPS the greatest obstacle that stands in the way of the development of a fine and equitable art sense is the habit common to much critical comment of attempting to supply us with specific explanations. Today, to a greater extent perhaps than at any time of which we have adequate record, art is concerned less with the significance of the thing said than with the method and manner of the saying. The next step is to impose upon the artist an arbitrary formula of the reviewer's own making. This or that system is pointed out to him as an infallible means of securing a commendable distinction. The one and only consideration of any importance whatsoever—the question as to whether the artist has genius or not—is obscured and forgotten. Small wonder that there has grown up in the art of our time an overwhelming tendency in the direction of very self-conscious, mechanical and premeditated forms of expression. The question of nationalism in music is a conspicuous case in point. Certain writers of an excellent integrity have attributed the obvious negligibleness of American music to its failure to accept and to utilize a national musical material. Taking as their premise the totally erroneous assumption that great art finds its inspiration in the soil of a nation and amongst [376] Charles L. Buchanan a nation's people, they tell us that our music will never succeed in achieving a commendable salience and significance until it has spoken with a national accent and revealed through an indigenous utterance an unmistakable national character. One of these gentlemen has gone so far as to predict that the future American opera and symphony will be written in ragtime—"the one genuine American music." I call attention to the protuberant one-sidedness of this remarkable statement.  To say that our future operas and symphonies will be written in ragtime is the equivalent of saying that our future poetry and drama will be written in the colloquialisms of Mr. George M. Cohan.   No disparagement is intended either to Mr. Cohan or to ragtime.   Mr. Cohan's gifts are as vivid and vital in their way as Mr. Paderewski's are in his.   An equitable judgment does not emphasize the one at the expense of the other; it accepts both for their individual inherent worth.   But it does not commit the error of confusing the relative importance of their contribution. Unfortunately, the advocates of ragtime are not content to allow ragtime to remain a valuable component of a problematical future American music.   If they were content to tell us what rattling good fun ragtime is and how much unique and irresistible charm it possesses, we should heartily agree with them.   But they are not content to allow ragtime to remain one of the influences from which a future American music may find its inspiration; they peremptorily urge it upon us as the only influence capable of creating a genuine American utterance.   In other words, they prescribe a formula to which so occult and abstract a thing as sound must adhere if it is to qualify in their estimation as an original and necessary musical speech.   I think the extremity of this point of view stultifies itself and impairs the validity of its own cause. I have committed myself elsewhere to the direct and unequivocal statement that there is absolutely no trace of nationalism to be found in that kind of music that the world calls [377] Two Views of Ragtime great music. I repeat this statement. I know of no single instance where a composition that is built out of national material has achieved a pre-eminent distinction. Take any composer you please and go over in your mind his accomplishments. Ask yourself what he is best known by, what has brought him his fame and his prestige. You need not tell me that his point of view is national, whatever his music may be, because that is not precisely the point. I merely ask you to take the material of any one of the world's great pieces of music and ask yourself whether, as sheer sound, this material is indicative of any national origin whatsoever. If you had no previous knowledge of the identity of the composer and you were to hear the prelude to Tristan or the first and last movements of Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony do you think you could tell that the one was German, the other Russian? Do you think you could detect the nationality of eight-tenths of the great music of the world? Do you find any traces of "folk" in Debussy, Stravinsky, Loeffler, Schonberg and Orn-stein? Could you tell the nationality of any one of these men from the sound of their music? I am sure you could not; and for my part I should prefer that the question be decided from the statistical concreteness of this demonstration. But aside from this there are two other important aspects of the matter that the advocates of ragtime do not appear to have sufficiently taken into account. For one thing, we may well ask whether ragtime supplies us with a legitimate equivalent to a Russian or a German or an Irish folk tune. Is it, when we closely inspect the matter, the inevitable reflex of our life and character that its enthusiastic advocates claim it to be? Is it not possible that, for all its dvnamic and compelling excellences, it remains, in the last analysis, a mere excrescence on the troubled surface of our national life? One thinks of a Russian folk-song as a thing come down out of the fantastic superstitions, the homely, frank, frugal hopes and fears and desires of a primitive people [378] Charles L. Buchanan that had not lost touch with the purifying influences of earth. To me there is an irreconcilable difference between a people's song that has grown out of an unsophisticated soil, and a patois of the pavement that has grown out of vaudevilles and cabarets. I should no more like to think that the American temperament was conclusively revealed and summed-up in this musical slang than I should like to think it revealed and summed-up in the vernacular of Broadway. I do not think it is. I would go elsewhere in my search for what I consider the essential gist and pith of this country's emotional and spiritual identity, and I should partially find it in the songs of Stephen Foster, an authentic genius if ever there was one. Here is a melodist who can hold his own in any company, and I like to think that the heart and backbone of this country is more accurately expressed in the rural, wistful lilt of this music than it is in the kind of sound that beats its brazen way into one's ears above the strident glare and clamor of cafes and dance-halls. However, I lay no particular stress on this point. I am perfectly willing to allow a nation that is founded upon a rather lax immigration law and very little else to seek its musical ancestry in a Mr. Schwartz or a Mr. Berlin. But does it ever occur to the people that are urging upon our musicians the very premeditated procedure of recognizing and utilizing ragtime that the great authentic creator supplies his own material, that, in other words, his worth to us is in proportion to his wealth of individual inspiration? Why, precisely, do we lay any particular stress upon Debussy and Ornstein? Surely the paramount reason is solely and simply because these men have contributed, to a greater extent than any of their contemporaries, to the progress of music; they have, in other words, supplied us with an unmistakably personal and original idiom. Now what shall we say is the particular status of the musician who persistently relies upon material other than his?  With all the best intentions in the [379] Two Views of Ragtime world we cannot count Mr. Percy Grainger, for example, a great creative musician on the strength of his Irish Tune from County Derry. He is not in this particular instance the creator of a new beauty, he has merely rearranged a beauty that already existed. Nor is it possible to contend that a Chopin mazurka bears the unimpeachable testimony to the genius of Chopin that is borne by a Chopin prelude, etude, or ballade. The mazurka is a clever and often a very beautiful putting together of certain clearly defined national characteristics of a melodic and rhythmic nature; the prelude, the etude, the ballade are a coming into the world of a something that had not been there before, a new loveliness self-conceived, an emanation from that indefinable essence in man we call the spiritual. To compare for a moment the relative merits of a composition such as the D Minor Prelude, the G Minor Ballade, the B Minor and C sharp minor Scherzos, the F minor, C minor and A minor Etudes, Opus 25 (compositions absolutely lacking in the faintest trace of national color) with a Chopin mazurka is sheer, unadulterated nonsense. From the standpoint of a mere loveliness perhaps you cannot prove the mazurka any the less worthy. But it is fairly obvious that the amount of imagination, concentration, inventive genius, constructive ability, etc., displayed in the D minor Prelude, the G minor Ballade, etc., is incomparably superior to the amount of these qualities that is displayed in the mazurka. After all, the man who conceives his own theme, his own manner and his own musical architecture must be accredited a more valuable contributor to the progress of his art than the man who, however felicitous his methods, contents himself with a mere co-ordinating and amplifying of what others have suggested. Personally, I am convinced that there is something inherently deficient in the substance of the appeal made by idiom and vernacular. I think a conclusive proof of this is furnished by the preference that the highest judgments accord [380] Charles L. Buchanan to music that is abstract in its quality and universal in its significance. If I have played Percy Grainger's Irish Tune from County Derry for a couple of years' time I have impaired something of the charm that it originally held for me. Its beauty has become thin, tenuous, I had almost said a little wearisome. But if I play the opening bars of Tristan or Tchaikovsky's Adagio Lamentoso I experience the full measure of that sensation of ardor mixed with awe that I experienced a score of years ago. I can offer no explanation of this; I merely say it is so in my case; it may not be so in yours. To my view, this kind of music seems a part and parcel of the great, immutable, mysterious balances; I believe this kind of music hints more acutely of and is more closely allied with the spiritual activities of the universe than the music of a dialect, of a given locality, of a people. Lest I be suspected of prejudice, one word more: I enjoy ragtime as heartily as I enjoy a good laugh. As a matter of fact I have so regretted the prodigality with which it is tossed out by our pied-pipers of the Great White Way and thrown at last into the great cosmical discard that I have for my own satisfaction jotted down records of it for many years back. I believe that ragtime with its subtle, interior rhythms, its slouchy hanging back for the infinitesimal fraction of a second on one note, its propulsive urging forward on another, is the ultimate medium for the expression of a certain kind of action. There should be no argument over the fact that it is an indispensable adjunct to the progress of music. But I should no sooner think of demanding that a composer seek his inspiration exclusively from ragtime than I should think of telling him to pattern himself exclusively upon Ornstein or Debussy. The two extremes are identical in their utter and very injurious fatuity. I would merely ask that he be himself—not ragtime or Russia or Debussy or anything else. For after all it seems to me that Self is what we want in an artist, not racial characteristics.   I am for having both, if vou [381] Two Views of Ragtime will, in their proper proportion. When, in response to a rather absurd inquiry, Grainger said that he considered Sewanee River the most beautiful song ever written, he said something more commendable for its audacity than for its accuracy. How much more equitable Grainger's answer would have been if he had said that Sewanee River was a beautiful song, but that there were songs of Schumann, Schubert, Brahms, Grieg, Tchaikovsky, etc., that were equally beautiful in a different way. Standards may be maintained and proclaimed without a resource to arbitrary and artificial distinctions. For example, I would certainly not dismiss Carpenter's Adventures in a Perambulator, merely because it does not exploit a national idiom, nor would I accept certain compositions that I have in mind merely because they do exploit a national idiom. Borrowing from the million and more tunes of the last twenty years will no more infallibly confer distinction upon a man than the use of broken color will insure his becoming as interesting a painter as Monet. Away with these prescribed rules and regulations! The great American composer, if one is vouchsafed us, will be great for the sole and simple reason that he is a genius and not because he uses this, that, or any other material and mode of expression. 382The Seven Arts Chronicle for July Henry David Thoreau (1817-1917) IT is a hundred years this month since Thoreau was born (July 12, 1817). Perfectly self-coherent as he was and, unlike most writers, the embodiment of all his ideas, he marks better perhaps than any other figure in our social history the distance we have travelled in our progress from the unity of the one to the unity of the many. "The universe," he said, "is always on the side of the most sensitive." The world, in the long run, is always on the side of those who have been able to contrive some definite pattern out of life. v Thoreau's pattern was that of the pioneer mind itself, which in him realized its height and depth. Unwilling as he was to yield his allegiance to any ideas which the instincts of his fellow-countrymen had not entitled them to, he gave no hostages to the ever-shifting fabric of a society that had no fund of ideals verified in the general experience of the race. That is why he has outlasted so many of his more gifted contemporaries, lightly caught out of themselves, lightly undone. He knew how primitive at bottom was the life that surrounded him, and like Whitman the only men he really respected were men close to the elements, the forest, the sea, the soil. It was among such alone that he was able to discover the perfect integrity which he exacted from living things and found in such abundance in trees and animals. It was this that led him to look with the aloofness of an immortal upon the world out of which he had grown like a resinous and vibrant little hemlock, solitary and disdainful among the ephemeridae of an April meadow. For Thoreau, whose imagination never compassed the gelatinous mass of humankind, society meant nothing but the infringement of the individual. "Blessed are the young," he said, "for they never read the President's message." He was an anarchist not through the wisdom of the serpent but the innocence of the dove, a skeptical innocence that allowed nothing to pass without proof. Our original "man from Missouri," he never forgot, however, that skepticism degrades itself when it stands guard not over the ends but over the means of life. So far as the means were concerned, it was impossible for Thoreau to take them seriously at all; he was literally "out from under" society by virtue of a continence like that of a lone goldfish in a glass of ice-water. And he was as unsinkable as a cork, thanks to the universal tinker's genius with which his nimble-handed forebears had endowed him. His disdainfulness, no. doubt, came a little cheap, and his immortal airs would not have been less convincing had they been put to the test of mortal desire. But then he would not have been the perfectly typical man he was, he would not have been able to flatter us now with a sense of our own immeasurable advance in frank [383] The Seven Arts Chronicle self-knowledge and free experience. As it is, he Hatters us quite enough. In much that our generation holds dear Thoreau was poor indeed. His emotional rigidity, for example, must have been unique even in Concord. A young girl once complained that having taken her to the top of a mountain, he fixed his earnest gaze on a distant point in the landscape and remarked, "How far is it in a bee-line to that spot?" It is conceivable, of course, that he had other thoughts then and on similar occasions, but they never found expression even in his verse. Practical enough to be able to regulate even the beating of his pulse, he kept the chambers of his mind in perfect order by packing everything that got in his way up into the attic of Transcendentalism. A capacious attic that was indeed, without which Concord could hardly have existed at all. It contained, among other things, a veritable Pandora's box full of all the amorous plagues that confuse and terrify mankind. But never a germ escaped. It had been locked for generations and the key had been hidden away, heaven knows where, in the old world, and the dust had gathered on it, and it had been forgotten. Yet how much they owed to that box, the philosophers of Concord! Never before or since have high thinkers and plain livers had smoother sailing. With regard to the objective world, moreover, Thoreau leaves off where we begin. But might it not be added that we begin on the hither side of a great many important things the secret of which he possessed and we have lost? His imagination, unlike Emerson's absolutely concrete, required a commensurate field of fact of a sort that society only affords where a certain number of people have   disengaged   themselves from necessity and accepted parts in the tragi-comedy of the free life. Half a dozen of his contemporaries had taken this step: Thoreau made the most of them. John Brown, Whitman, and one or two others, as we know, appealed to him even more than bumblebees; but one swallow does not make a summer and a handful of individuals cannot make the corporate life significant if it has no significance without them. Besides, to the beasts of the field Thoreau could allow a certain latitude; precisely because, having no souls, they never whine about them, as Whitman said, they offered him an unlimited scope for a purely pagan delight. The sensuous and dramatic in man could not have passed the censorship of his multifarious principles; toward the rest of creation he could adopt without compunction the role of the free spectator, "clear of the nets of right and wrong." I have said that he possessed a secret which we have lost. It was the secret of the sensuous life in a rich objective world. The life of nature meant more to Thoreau than the life of man has meant to any of our novelists, in its appeal, 1 mean, to the eye, the ear, the touch, the taste. There are pages in "Waldcn" which, by contrast, show up our American fiction, despite its occasional glamour, its frequent finesse, for the poor unpalatable straw it mostly is. To Thoreau there was a perceptible music in the universe, an ^olian music, and it was not through the contemplative inner ear that he received it, as Emerson did,—he heard it as plainly as a sensitive modern ear hears the music of humankind in the rhythm of city streets. It was this that gave him his marvellous power, like that of Saint Francis, over the lower orders, in which he divined an [384] Henry David Thoreau (1817-1917) unconscious aspiration. The fox he characterized as "a rudimentary, burrowing man" and it disturbed him that we treat horses merely as automata to get work from, without any sense of responsibility to the spark of life that glimmers in them. It would be easier to find these complaints altogether absurd were they not bound up with a certain faculty possessed by Thoreau which testified to a profound grasp of the invisible forces. Rowing on Walden Pond, for example, he would put his hand into the water and gently lift out a fish which, after a moment's caress, would lie motionless across his palm for the space of half an hour. Feats like this gave him in the eyes of the village children a glamour like that which surrounded Virgil in the Middle Ages. The spiritual powers that made them possible, translated to the written page, constitute a lost province in our literary mind. It is not this, however, it is not even his atavistic and half animal simplification of life, so alluring in certain ways just now, for which we remember him; it is the firmness of his personal texture, the force with which he enclosed and cultivated the little garden-plot of his own character. Stevenson called him a "skulker," Lowell said that his whole life was a search for the doctor. But there is something solid in Thoreau, beside which these two engaging literary entertainers of an optimistic and highly self-delusive past ring exceedingly hollow. He was as queer as Dick's hatband and he rubs most modern philosophy the wrong way. As for his prose, it contains passages of the kind which people used to call imperishable and which our contemporaries take a special delight in forgetting just for that reason. But in spite of everything he has never quite lost his tenacious grip on our imagination. Is it because of the conscientious objector in him, which our indeterminate and facile democracy has always found it so hard to forgive? At bottom we love self-discipline, we love obstacles, we love austerity, and Thoreau is a perpetual reminder, the most vivid reminder our history affords us, that it is the toughness, the intransigence of the spiritual unit which alone gives edge to democracy. As our epoch of expansion draws to its close and we are obliged more and more to test the mettle of our social consciousness, we shall be brought back to this truth, apprehended in so many ways by our fathers in the forest. The day will come when easy solutions no longer have any charm for us and we shall have attained the strength to fashion ourselves in the face of the multitudinous modern world. Then Thoreau will delight us anew,—not least because the gate of his Utopia was a needle's eye. A new large life of Thoreau has just been issued (Houghton, Mifflin Co., $4.00 net). It was written by his intimate friend, Frank B. Sanborn, who died last February, fifty-four years later than Thoreau himself. The book contains little that is fresh as regards interpretation; while it is vigorously written, it suffers from the general inbreeding tendency that has been characteristic of so many of the survivors of the old New England Renaissance. Without pretending to be a formal biography, it contains however all manner of letters, anecdotes, etc., that have not appeared before. Its most interesting feature is a collection of early essays by Thoreau, hitherto unpublished, together with the journal of his brief tour in the Middle West. [385] The Seven Arts Chronicle New Books PROFILES FROM CHINA These are times when the Orient becomes increasingly important. Our eyes are turned to the East with a growing understanding or, at least, a desire to understand. With China a republic and Japan fighting "to make the world safe for democracy," even the yellow journals have stopped threatening us with "the yellow peril." Strangely enough, what first attracted us was the aesthetic interest. In the last couple of years our literature, anticipating politics, has made many and concerted friendly gestures in an easterly direction. After Laf-acadio Hearn (the validity of whose interpretations is still in dispute) there was a long silence, interrupted occasionally by such home-grown and hybrid exotics as "The Yellow Jacket." It was Ernest Fenolosa's manuscripts more than any other single impetus, that awakened the present great interest, first in the crystalline beauty of the old Chinese poets and then in the country that produced them. Today the movement is in full swing. Several of our poets are writing fragments and images in the manner of Li Po. Others are writing about oriental customs and China itself. Eunice Tietjens is one of the few who have actually gone there. She saw what there was first—saw it without pre-conceived poetic dogmas or personal prejudices—and then (reversing the usual "literary" procedure) she wrote about it. The result ("Profiles from China"; Ralph Fletcher Seymour, Chicago) is a little volume of extraordinary interest and power. It reveals, in simple and flexible lines, a strange conglomeration of legendry and sordid fact; of glamor and ugliness. It flashes a panorama of a world that neither accepts nor rejects; a world that swallows civilizations and closes its inscrutable eyes to meditate on a future that is to perpetuate its past. The two poems printed in this number of The Seven Arts are among the best and most representative things in Mrs. Tietjens' volume. "The Hand" is something more than a skilful piece of character delineation; it purports to represent the East in microcosm—it is a symbol of its delicate artistry and exquisite cruelties. "New China: The Iron Works," gives a sharp picture of the conflict of East and West, of the dirt and hopelessness surrounding and engulfing the vast machinery of modern industrialism, of "tomorrow set in yesterday ... a graft but not a growth." The endless squalor of China is the thing which the poet cannot lose sight of; it makes even the brief flashes of beauty seem hard and shameless. Not that Mrs. Tietjens fails to catch that beauty; she reveals its colors lovingly, at times, even humorously. With a light crayon she draws "The Dandy" and "Chinese New Year" or, with a more ironic and bitter touch, "The Feast," "Recollections in a Ricksha," "The Well." But it is the horror that affects the poet most; sometimes, as in "The City Wall", it is the mere physical horror of filth and poverty; sometimes, as in "Cormorants," it is the spiritual horror of the rotting indolence and flabby unconcern. The middle section ("Echoes") is the least original of the three groups, and it is the least engaging. These artificial lilies and lacquer-prints have been imitated far more successfully by Ezra Pound, Amy Lowell and other imagists, who have been intrigued and even more influenced by [386] New Books the Japanese hokku, with its concise and vivid pictures. But it is a short section, and the succeeding one brings the volume up to the high level on which the book opened. In its direct critical power it is even sharper than the first part. And it makes a fitting conclusion to a volume that must rank high both as an art work and a social interpretation. FREUD AND FORSLIN Outside of the alliterative value, these two names have little to do with each other. It is only the author's explanation that prompts the pairing. "Forslin," says Conrad Aiken in his preface to "The Jig of Forslin" (The Four Seas Co.) "is not a man, but Man." Furthermore, the jacket informs one that the book is "based on the Freudian psychology. The average man or woman finds in vicarious experience—that is, in reading or hearing about the adventures of other men and women—escape from the monotony of existence." This, of course, is not Freudian; it is scarcely elementary psychology. It is the obvious in the terms of the platitudinous. As for the work itself, it is a haphazard but intriguing collection of verse-pictures, moods and narratives which are, by turns, restrained and decorative, theatrical and grotesque. It has moments of sensitive beauty and passages of power, but these are no more based on "Freudian psychology" than they are derived from the Montessori system, "The Origin of Species" or the theory of malicious animal magnetism. The way in which the separate poems are connected and the repetition of Leitmotifs by which the work is given unity show no little grace and skill. Mr. Aiken is seldom clumsy and never dull. But an air of artifice and affectation  hangs over  the volume; there is a plethora of phrase-making and preciosity like: "Rhythms there are that take the blood with magic, Smoothing it out in silver," and there are times when the poem carries its hyper-theatricality almost into hysteria. Its pages are a jumble of suicides, prostitutes, lamias, murders, vampires, salomes, syphilitics, a parade of harlots, echoes of the underworld and perfumed, pre-raphaelite sins. "The Jig of Forslin" presents a curious study in inversion—and, although it may be interesting to the general public, it might be even more profitable to the psycho-analyst. L. U. DOSTOIEVSKY AND OTHERS During his later years Dostoievsky published from time to time, by subscription, installments of "The Journal of an Author," a vast miscellany into which he poured his reflections on life and on Russia. Two sections of this journal are included in the small volume just issued under the collective title by John Luce and Co., Boston ($1.25 net) : they are "The Dream of a Queer Fellow," a unique Russian Utopia which, in its rather hectic pathos can only be compared with the yearning visions of the Apocryphal New Testament, and the celebrated speech on Pushkin, one of the most striking of Dostoievsky's works, reprinted here with all the original explanatory and supplementary matter which the author added in order to drive his arguments home. Dostoievsky believed that Russia had a divine mission in the world and that she was destined to win civilization back from the false loves of industrialism to the spirit of brotherhood in Christian love.   This idea, [387] The Seven Arts Chronicle illustrated by an analysis of two or three of Pushkin's characters, forms the body of the speech (delivered in 1880). The supplementary matter has an additional and highly personal interest for us Americans, for it is there that he shows the extreme danger of emphasizing civic and institutional as opposed to personal ideals, and thus cutting life into "two halves." Dostoievsky's onslaught on the Russian intellectuals might almost have been written of our own today, had we anyone sufficiently sure of his own moral ground to write it. He found them "the enemies of Russia's organic and independent development upon her own national principles" because, in a spirit of contempt for Russia, they wanted to institutionalize Russian life on the European liberal plan, taking themselves as models, and without reference to the fact that the very programmes they desired to impose had brought Europe to spiritual bankruptcy and the brink of an inevitable world war. Little in Dostoievsky's argument, it is true, can be transposed, point by point, to meet our own situation, partly because, owing to the general unself-consciousness of our life, our own "national principles" are still to seek. We are not yet in a position where with a well-founded assurance we can say to the one, "Humble thyself!" and to the other, "Exalt thyself!" But whatever faith we have tells us that this is only a matter of time. For the interim, to absorb Dostoievsky is to become oneself a seeker, confidently blind only to the false dawn of the self-appointed intellectuals who have solved our problems by denying them. Somebody some day is going to isolate the collective psychology of the South and analyze it.   Then we shall know why it is that our hearts descend into our boots when we glance through a book like "Southern Life in Southern Literature" (Ginn and Co.). Even more than the rest of America the South seems to have had a profound aversion to reality.   Is it because the old ruling class was entirely isolated from competing classes with competing interests and ideas? Or because the slave system gave even the poor whites a contempt for work! Or because the Southerners were led by Jefferson and other leaders to assert theoretically a set of democratic principles that the whole structure of their society gave  the lie to? Perhaps these   inherent   contradictions are enough   to   explain   why Southern authors   have   always instinctively placed between themselves and life a veil of sentimentality.    They have always "written well," thanks to a romantic  sense  of  the picturesque added to an eighteenth century tradition of style, but, aside from Poe, of the whole body of writing represented in this book, "Uncle Remus" alone comes to us with any suggestion of ..elemental power ...    As to the publication of books of this kind, it is easy enough for Northerners to see that Southerners ought not to be encouraged to stew in their own juice. Unfortunately we are all led to do this all the time.   The study of English in the universities has raised up a legion of young instructors with a mania for editing.  They are not sufficiently free or energetic in their own minds to react in a personal way upon the documents of the past; what they do is to accept those documents, annotate them in the most painstaking way, and give them a new and formidable claim on people's attention. And here as elsewhere competition is our undoing. They have to find something "different" to edit each time, [388] New Books these young instructors, and the ingenuity with which they set about it is only equalled by the mediocrity of what they rind. Surely this is not the least of the vicious circles for which we have to thank our educational system. Mr. Edwin E. Slosson's "Six Major Prophets" (Little, Brown and Co., $1.50 net) are Shaw, Chesterton, Wells, F.C.S. Schiller, John Dewey and Rudolph Eucken, most of whom, since the war began, have sadly shrunk from the major to the minor category. But what Mr. Slosson means by a major prophet is simply an exceptionally lively human being; —as for their messages, are they not all written in the bond if one is a pragmatist (like Mr. Slosson) and the human beings in question are lively enough! Eucken, one might suppose, would have presented a certain difficulty to Mr. Slosson's tolerant appetite; and perhaps this explains why the founder of Activism, though his point of view is stated with all candor, is handled so much more perfunctorily than Chesterton, who says that pragmatism is "bosh" and is permitted to lollop engagingly over sixty pages notwithstanding. Mr. Slosson exhibits his performing lions with a capital zest. One could only wish that having gone forth in search of prophets, he had had a little more of the pioneer in his own make-up. For there are prophets in the world whose messages have not been popularized and ought to be. The war has yielded already a small but fruitful crop. Whoever imagines that we have even begun to scotch the old evasive and complacent tradition of the American novel ought to read Ernest Poole's "His Family" (The Mac-millan Co., $1.50). It is a book of many qualities, to be sure, but they are precisely the qualities one rinds in a Howells novel, essentially reflective not active qualities, not the fruits of a sharp and passionate individual vision of life. They include, in the first place, form, an absolute unity of mood, but the mood, induced by a formula, is sustained by sentimentality. "His Family" is the story of a typical American father, so engrossed in his business that his three daughters have grown up strangers to him and taken their several directions uninfluenced by any common purpose. You feel their lives slipping out of leash, you have a sense of a social chaos in which the most intimate relations are casual, and then Mr. Poole gently herds your mind back again with his recurrent phrases about the familial mystery and its sacramental ties, and you reach the end feeling that the chaos itself has not been irradiated because the author has instinctively subordinated all his characters to a thesis. To straddle American life, to rind any sort of continuity in it is hard enough; that is why our novelists are so prone to adopt formulas and make their characters conform to them. But there are already precedents enough to show that our life can only become significant through individuals who are set sharply in relief against the whole inert background of which the family is the most inert element. The novel with the hero, however unsuccessful a hero, offers the most promising opportunity" just now. In his group-hero, the family, Mr. Poole has simply been able to cloak his own lack of personal preferences, his own fundamental complacency. EDUCATION AFTER THE WAR "When you are becoming discouraged about democracy and its future [389] The Seven Arts Chronicle visit Bedales." This advice given years ago has led many men and women to keep in touch with a most suggestive experiment station at Pe-tersfield in South England. More than a quarter of a century ago a young Cambridge student, J. H. Badley, came under the influence of Walt Whitman and Edward Carpenter and was inspired by them to undertake to work out the forms of democracy in their application to education. Participation in scientific investigation and in constructive work and co-education of the sexes were assumed as foundation principles. The result has been that many of the "new" ideas that have aroused violent controversy elsewhere have been worked out quietly and successfully at this center. At the same time there has never been any break with the best elements in the old education. Latin and Greek have continued to hold an honored place in the work of many of the students who were also concerned in practical studies and problems of productive labor. Few schools have given to their students so much contact with the arts of music, drawing and painting, the festival, dancing and the drama. Wise provision was made from the beginning so that each student would have time and resources for the carrying on of some hobby. These ranged from collecting, garden experimentation and dairying to play and music writing, the study of cathedrals and the excavation and recovery of old Roman villas buried in the neighboring Hampshire fields. It is out of this experience that Mr. Badley, the headmaster, has written "Education After the War" (Longmans, Green and Co.), in which he gives a sensible programme for the schooling of all classes and ages. His discussion of preparation for national service is one of the sanest statements that have appeared on the subject. F. A. M. William M. Chase IN THESE days when Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and abstract painting have become familiar among us, it is particularly interesting to recall and recognize the importance of the part played by the late William M. Chase in our artistic development. The recent memorial exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was a very sad affair, aesthetically considered, and gave but little idea of the painter's greater work as educator and propagandist. For Chase alone among our few painters of the seventies had the courage to force the artistic provincialism of America to create the taste by which he was to be enjoyed, and thus prepare the way for greatness greater than his own. Chase was not a great artist, not even a great painter; he was a romantic, spectacular figure of pioneer importance who opened up the untapped artistic consciousness of his countrymen, a typically American product, a publicist-painter of aggressive personality and contagious enthusiasm. And the influence of Chase upon the artistic education of America was, in the main, decidedly beneficent. This I maintain in the face of his own blatant egotism and his many banal canvases. At the time of his return to New York, after having studied in Munich, the country needed just such a picturesque,   forceful   figure   as his [390] William M. Chase Middle-Western extraction and his European experience had helped him to fuse himself into being. Although we seek to flatter ourselves to the contrary, there was, nevertheless, absolutely no general interest in art here in America until the later seventies, and only a handful of men of whom it could fairly be said that they even felt painting as a plastic art. Chase appeared, bristling with enthusiasm and an almost aggressive pride in his calling. He brought with him a magnetic dexterity in brushwork, coupled with a broader and more plastic treatment. Also, and this is important, he strongly opposed the taste then prevailing overwhelmingly here in America for painted sentimentalisms. He took to teaching, at the Art Students' League in New York City, later establishing a school of his own; and, because of his great love of externals, his insistence upon realistic presentation, and his own brilliantly effective painting itself, he appealed to the impressionable youth of his country, and soon had a numerous following. A cynic might say that P. T. Barnum missed a great opportunity when he failed to recognize in Chase the supreme prestidigitator. But America took him seriously—the which, I am inclined to believe, was, after all, very fortunate. Before beginning this note I again examined Chase's canvases in both the Brooklyn and Metropolitan Museums. I did so in the hope of being warmed up to say something sincerely complimentary of Chase as an artist. A realist, to which world-class Chase belongs, may well and fittingly be a great painter, seldom if ever is he a great artist. Rubens was a realist— and something more: his feeling for and powerful execution in figure composition were actually Olympian. Vermeer, a realist of the opposite na- ture, is worshipped not only for his wonderful painting but also for that inseparable something of intimate reserve which gives his few and small canvases their preciousness and quality. It is as a painter that Chase comes nearest to arousing enthusiasm. In his early interiors there is an almost joyous confusion of colorful objects, and a virile facility of handling never excelled by his masters in this genre: Alfred Stevens and Boldini. Although he never made so personal a thing of it, one feels that had he continued in this vein he had it in him successfully to contrast the suave, cynical elegance of Boldini and the textural excellence of the Belgian with something distinctively his own. Instead, he struck off at a tangent with his sensational fish pictures. Herein he could display to the full his skill in conjuring up realistically external representations. It is perhaps not without significance that in these still-life paintings Chase struck his most personal note. In the painting of portraits Chase was surpassed in his own manner by younger men. Still it is, after all, his manner and not theirs; this much at least is to his credit. But his portraits as art even his manner cannot save: they suffer still from Chase's own excessive preoccupation with the externals of life. A glance at almost any Sargent, for instance, will prove what I say. Chase was a shrewd observer, but he lacked that penetration into character—that observation with the inward eye—which is the essential gift of the great portrait painter. The "Woman in Black," owned by the Metropolitan Museum, is Chase's nearest approach to greatness in portraiture and one can see Whistler and Stevens in that. Chase's full-length portrait of Whistler, by the way, is a most amusing example of the influ- [391] The Seven Arts Chronicle ence of the subtle James upon the robust Chase: even while Chase is trying to paint him as the trifler, the trail of the serpentine Whistler has been allowed to impress itself over all! Of Chase's other and more characteristic portraits some are very ably painted, and most are, no doubt, good likenesses. Of Chase as a color-ist one can say nothing. And, despite his many years of painting and teaching, his knowledge of pure form and spacial composition was negligible. Yet it is inconceivable that there would be here in North America any cultivated public for the works of Manet, Renoir, Degas, or Rodin had not this field been ploughed and harrowed by Chase, had not the taste for it been created by him.   Not that this taste finds any of the above-mentioned men to its liking, no; but in its evolution it is slowly progressing toward a more catholic and modernistic attitude. Chase himself, to do him justice, went as far along as a man of his essentially objective vision could possibly go. Yet in his last years he was standing with his back to the wall, futilely striving to shout down the cry for those things for which he himself had quite unconsciously prepared the soil. He had fought long and hard for the recognition of the type of painting of which he was representative ; to see it all being swept away in his old age was galling indeed. This accounts for his venomous attacks upon Cezanne and the moderns. William Murrell. "Christus": an Italian Photoplay It was out of Italy that the first long photoplay came, and out of the studio that gives us Christus. From the days of Quo Vadis, the pioneer, made by this same Cines of Rome, through Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, Othello, Cabiria and now Christus, Italy has given us dignity, solidity, elaboration, visual beauty, a knowledge of what pictorial art had been and a reverence for its place in life and for such kindred matters as literature and the heroic traditions of the stage, added to splendid photography and the best of laboratory work. Some of these excellent things our studios have only just mastered, some are still out of our reach; yet when America sees this newest work of the Italian camera it may well thank th© god or the imp of the lens that our own pioneer movie people knew next to nothing of art and the traditions of pictorial beauty. Ignorance kept them close to the possibilities of the thing itself. They studied the new mechanism as they used it, and by trial and error they worked out a technique all their own. The Italians studied the theater, the picture gallery and the art photographer and set up a menage a trois in the name of cinema. In a flash they achieved a beauty and a majesty which our people can touch only haltingly today. But in a million flashes, our people have achieved a human expressiveness which is the original and vital technique of a genuinely new art. The issue is clear. The Italian seeks beauty but not life. He goes to infinite pains to find splendid "locations." He composes fine pictures against them. He lays the verity of Egypt and Jerusalem before us. The desert blooms under his hand. The hills of Judea render up vista after vista of inspiration. Joseph and Mary go into a misty desert where moonlight is moonlight and not some blue- [392] "Christus":   an   Italian Photoplay print of a sunny scene. The beauties of Gethsemane are shadowed ineffably with the peace of that last night. But is the reality of Asia Minor— only a few days' cruise from Italy— more thrilling art than the illusion of Asia Minor in Southern California, ten thousand miles away? And can the beauties of desert and moonlight and Jerusalem's tunnelled streets make us see Christ, when they hold only pantomimic rehearsals of the most obvious episodes? Comparisons with Griffith and his Christ story in Intolerance are inevitable. Griffith gave us the scenes that we expected and without which Christ could not live for us; but he gave us a score of things beside, that are far more necessary to a belief in his life. Griffith humanized the tale. He was not content to show us Christ in Jerusalem; he showed us Jerusalem itself. He gave us the busy streets. We glimpsed a wood-turner at work on the edge of the crowd. In a "close-up" of splendid composition, we were suddenly face to face with an animal-trapper from the desert. Another "long shot" at the street showed us a Pharisee halted for prayer; and then through "leader," "close-up" and "long shot" we learned that when a Pharisee prayed he demanded silence and immobility; and wood-turner and trapper and diner ceased from their occupations while the Pharisee talked to Jehovah. Christ could be a man as well as a God against such a background. He could sit with publicans and sinners and visit the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee, make miracles and forgive sins; and be believed. But what of this Christus? A lengthy "leader" tells us what he is about to do. Amid a throng of well-composed but quite undistinguishable actors, he goes through the motions of which we have just read. Then comes another "leader" and another event, both some months or miles away. If the director has a thrilling bit like the stoning of the woman taken in adultery, he puts a "leader" on the screen which gives at one and the same time Christ's injunction— "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her," and his subsequent admonition to the woman, "Go, and sin no more." Then he shows us a distant group in which the actor playing Christ goes through the facial motions of reproving the multitude, and, turning to Mary, repeats the operation for what we must presume to be the second group of words on the screen. Who can forget Griffith's handling of the woman; her litter in the street, the curious populace, the sanctimonious elders shaking their skirts in reprobation; later Christ sitting in the arch of the building and the approach of the mob pursuing the woman; his protection of her, the abashed faces of the crowd; the "leader": "he that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her"; the missiles falling from unnerved fingers, the crowd withdrawing; then, and not till then, the second "leader": "go and sin no more," prepared and followed by pictures which held a consolation in the very grace of their composition? The Italian director pays Christ what he doubtless considers the respect of aloofness of almost no "close-ups," no "flash backs," no "dissolves," and he ends by making this Christus and his story the usual, unhuman recitation of facts with which Sunday school scholars are familiar. He doesn't realize our longing for detail, for a multitudinous reconstruction of the time and the people, for all the magicking of the movies that makes a delicately composed reality in which our imaginations can live and thrive. Is it really reverence after all? [393] The Seven Arts Chronicle Count Antamaro, who made the film, might be excused his deadly distance from Christ's reality by the plea that he is treating Christ as all our painters and statue makers and best preachers have treated him—avoiding any of the humanizing contact which he so loved. Perhaps that is part of the explanation; it is certainly a natural and easy part of the whole Italian cinema method. But what can one say of the trick photography with which the director has larded his film? If it is respect to show Christ vanishing from before the eyes of the man he has just healed; if it is reverence to pile a "disappearing act" upon a spot-light and "double-printed" version of the walking on the water; if it is truth to a religious narrative to whisk Christ off into thin air as he scatters the moneychangers from the temple steps, then give me impudence and the "close-up." It just happens that the American method, making Christ K live against the background of his time, also reveals the message which he brought. There is one by-product of the Italian worship of art that is worth further comment. It is the marvelous reconstruction—proudly heralded on the programme—of half a dozen famous paintings during the action of Christus. Fra Angelico's Annunciation, Correggio's Nativity, Leonardo's Last Supper bring a real power to those moments in the film, because the director has borrowed, through them, the intuitions and the technique of great artists. It is not, however, a field in which our American directors are behindhand. William Christy Cabanne, who is more than likely to know the word Degas when he hears it, introduced Diane of the Follies by giving a steep-pitched wide-angle view of the lady against her dressing-room floor and a mirror. Scores of Metropolitan masterpieces supply the few virtues of Herbert Brenon. Rembrandt furnishes characterizing light and shade to the studios of Thomas H. Ince. Alan Dwan knows Vermeer. It may be humility or it may be disingenu-ousness which guides our directors in not announcing on the screen the source of their inspiration. At any rate, it is good sense. It keeps illusion. Our directors must learn to use art as it should be used—a sourcebook to be stolen from until they can make their own. Reverence for old masters or anything else except life and its appropriate expression is of little use when a new art is in the making. Reverence is the ruin of Christus. Reverence for the formulas of art instead of its creative spirit; and so reverence for the attitudes of religion instead of its actualities. There was more of Christ in the few minutes that D. W. Griffith gave him out of the mad scramble of Intolerance than in all the two hours and a quarter of Christus, just as there is more of life in the hurried, shifting gaucheries of American movies than in all the studied, traditional beauties of Italian films. And that is because there is an imperative humanity in the American movie technique which the Italians' cultured reverence for pictorial art cannot touch. Kenneth MacGowan. [394] Your Friends?
