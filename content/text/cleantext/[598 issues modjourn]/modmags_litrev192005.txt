Hueffer FOR a longlong time I dare say for twenty five years I have been longing to say something about HudsonBut what is there to sayOf things immensetranquil or consummateit is difficult indeed to speak or to writeThe words are at the tip of the tonguethe ideas at the back of the brainand yetNothingSo one says immensetranquilconsummate Suppose one should say that one would willingly cancel every one of the forty or so books that one has published if one could be given the power to write one paragraph as this great poet writes a paragraphor that one would willingly give up all one s powers of visualising this and that if one could be granted this great naturalist s power of looking at a little bird But of course that would not be enoughOr rather it would be nothing at allFor I suppose that if one had the power to frame one paragraph one could frame othersand if one had the vision of the poet one would be the poet s selfOne might say and indeed I do say with perfect sinceritythat one would willingly sacrifice all one s gifts as a writer if one could give to this unapproached master of English ten years longer of writing life But even that would be selfish for one 4 The Little Review would have the pleasureone would read what he wroteFor methenHudson is the unapproached master of the English tongueThere are no doubt other English writers though English as a language is woefully lacking in prose towards which one need not be kind in unassailable proseStill there are possibly other English writersBut there is no other English writer that you cannot say something aboutOne derives from Sir Thomas Browne but is not as goodanother gets his effects from a profound study of the Authorised Version but falls short of the resonance of the Inspired Originalanother has caught the jolly humor of Rabelaiswhen MrPeskith writes you might swear it was Montaigne speakingsomeone else puts down the thoughts of Dante in the language of Shapespeare Wellwe know the sort of stuff that English prose isOnly Hudson is differentThe only English writer with whom I have ever had the luck to discuss thehowof writing was MrConrad I will say this for Americans thatif they practice lettersthey are much more usually devoured by curiosity about what is calledtechnique I have heard MrOwen Wister talk for quite a time on several occasions with MrJames about the written word as a means of expressionI have talked for hours with members of the editorial staff of New York magazinesas to how to write a short storyand I used to talk for hours with Stephen Crane why is poor dear Stevie forgottenthe finest poet that two continents produced in a centuryjust about wordsAnd Crane made the most illuminating remark about English prose that I ever heard But the only true blue English writers that I ever heard discuss how to writeas apart from how to make money by writing or who was the best Agent or the worst Publisher or the meanest Editor or the Best Seller wasthenMrConradAndonceMrConrad looked up from readingGreen Mansionsand said You can t tell how this fellow gets his effects Anda long time after I had agreed that I couldn t tell how Hudson got his effectsConrad continued He writes as the grass growsThe good God makes it be thereAnd that is all there is to it And that is all there is to it Green Mansionsis the only English novel of passionthePurple Landis the only English novel of The Little Review 5 Romanceand I don t except MrConrad s and my own RomancesNature in DevonlandHampshire DaysBirds in a Villageand theShepherdsLifeare the only English books about EnglandAnd you must remember that MrHudson is an American of New England stock The Good God makes it be thereWas there ever a more splendid phrase uttered of a writer s proseEvery morning of my life I lie in bed and look at a piece of mutton fat dangling from a string outside the open windowSuddenly there is a flirt of wingsthe mutton fat crepitatesas you might sayagainst the panesBut you see nothingThen the bird grows bolderreturnsIt becomes a bird formhangingupside down from the piece of fatpecking rapidlyAgainst the morning light it looks greywith dark margins on the headIt is one of the titsthe Great TitI dare sayWellthere it is and that s thatIf you or I wrote about itthat would be all there was to itA Gilbert White wrote about tomtits running up drains in the neighbourhood of houses in search of succulent morselsBut imagine MrHudson first watching the bird and then writing about itI suppose the chief characteristic of great writers of writers who are great by temperament as well as by industry or contrivance is self abandonmentYou imagine MrHudson watching a tiny being and his whole mind goes into the watchingthen his whole mind goes into the renderingProbably there is some delight in the watching and more austeritymore diligencein the act of recordingThat no doubt variesTurgenev is such another as MrHudson and I can recall no thirdTurgenevI meanwatched humanity with much such another engrossment as MrHudson devotes to Kingfisherssheep or the grass of fields and rendered his results with the same tranquilityProbablyhoweverTurgenev had a greater self consciousness in the act of writingfor of MrHudson you might as well say that he never had read a bookThe Good God makes his words be there St 11in theSportsman s Sketchesand in theSingers theRattle of the Wheelsand inBielshin Prairieabove all you get that noteof the enamouredof the raptwatcherso enamoured and so 6 The Little Review rapt that the watcher disappearsbecoming merely part of the surrounding atmosphere amidst whichwith no self consciousnessthe menthe forests or the birds act and interactI knowhoweverof no other writers that possess this complete selflessnessIt is no doubt this faculty that gives to MrHudson s work the power to suggest vast very tranquil space and a man absolutely at home in itor motionless vegetationa huge forest and a traveler who wishes to go nowhereor ever to reach the forest boundsFor you can suggest immensity in your rendering of the smallest of British birds if you know an immense deal about the bird itselfif you have watched innumerable similar birdstravelling over shirescountriesduchieskingdomshemispheres and always selflesslySo the rendering of one individual bird will connote to the mind of your readerif you happen to be MrHudsonthe great distances of country in which you have travelled in order thathaving seen so many such birdsyou may so perfectly describe this oneGreat plains will rise up before your reader s mindimmensely high skiesdistant blue rangesfar woodlands Tranquil spacesimmense distances Consummate tooBecause of course the Bon Dieu I beg MrConrad s pardonthe Good God did something consummate when he gave to MrHudson a style that is like the green grass growingIIIt is twenty five or twenty fouror twenty threeyears ago since I sat with Conradone day in the drawing room of my farmthe Pent it was calledWe were deep in the struggles that producedRomanceand Conrad was groaning terribly and telling me as he has told in several kingdomsshiresduchiescountries and languagesthat I did not know how to writeOf course I didn t know howto write as MrConrad did before he became a true blue EnglishmanAt any rate we were engrossedA man went past the windowvery tallcasting a shadow across the pink monthly rosesThese commonplace Kentish flowers peeped over the window sill of the deepliving room whose low dappled The Little Review 7 ceiling was cut in half by a great beamSo the tall man s shadow flickered across themIt is disturbing when youa man of lettersengrossed in theHeart of the Country see a shadow fall from a very tall stranger across your room and the monthly rosesYou think of dunsbailiffsunpaid butcher s bills But Conradalways sanguinehoping for the bestI never had many hopes when strangers approached meexclaimed That will be the man who wants to sell a horse Panicanyhowseized usDans un grenier comme on est bien a vingt ans I suppose I was twenty four A panicThe immensely tall stranger repassed the windowConrad went to the doorAnd I heardConradYou ve come about the mareVoiceI m HudsonConradShe s out with the ladiesVoiceI m HudsonConradThe mare will be back in about half an hourHudson was staying at New Romney which is New only in the sense that William Ibuilt it in 1080 ADinstead of Caesar in 45 BC Hudson thenwas staying at New Romney and had walked over fourteen miles in order to pay his respects to the great author ofYouthHeart of DarknessLord Jim andAlmayer s FollyI remember Hudson again there are more reminiscencesin one of the beastly cafes in Soho They resemble Mouquin s in Sixth AvenueNew Yorkthough I do not remember Mouquin s as being beastlyat all but very expensive by comparison At any rate it was the Cafe RijiSohoThere were present MrGalsworthyMrHilaire BellocMrEdward GarnettMr WellI don t remember every one who was presentAnd just as MrBelloc was shoutingGlorious CountySussex in came MrHudsonThe dialogue went on like thisBellocGlorious countySussexGlorious countySussexYou can ride from the Crystal Palace to Beachy Head with only four decks8 The Little Review Fivesaid MrHudsonIt was like the crack of doomlike the deep voice of a ravenlike the sound of a direful bellBellocOnly four checksThere s Wokingand Cuckingand Ducking andFive said MrHudsonBellocOnly four checks He used a great many gesticulationstelling the names off on his fingers in the French way There are Woking and Cucking and Ducking and HickleyFive said MrHudsonMrBelloc repeated the queer names of Sussex villagesThen MrHudson said East Dean MrBelloc threw his hand violently over his head as one used to see people do on the Western frontthen began to tearimmediately afterwardsat his ruffled hairHe exclaimedMy GodWhat a fool I am and stated that he was a Sussex manbred and born in Sussexhad never been out of Sussex for an instant in his lifehad ridden every day from the Crystal Palace to Beachy HeadYet he had forgotten East DeanAll the while MrHudson sat motionlessgraveunwinkinggazing at his victim with the hypnotic glare of a beast of preyOas if he were studying a new specimen of the genus FringillagoIIIAnd I dare say that is how MrHudsongets his effects gazing at his subject with the expressionless passion of a bird of prey keeping as still as a treeand then cutting down words to nothingFor the three wordsthe reiteratedFiveand the finalEast Dan convinced one that MrHudson had lived on the South Downs all his life and that you could trust him to take you from Bramber to Findon in pitch black nightWhereas the thousands of words that MrBelloc poured out only made you doubt that he had ever ben in Sussex in his lifeOf course MrBelloc has lived in Sussex for a great part of hilifeand MrHudson was born in the Argentineof New England stockabout 1790I should sayI have heard him allege that who he The Little Review 9 came to England he was the first member of his family to set foot on these Islands for 250 yearsSo maybe he descends from the NavigatorAt any rate from those facts which may or may not be factsfor as to the real date of MrHudson s birth I have only impressionsas for instance having heard him talk in terms of great intimacy of the Dictator Bolivar who flourished about 1820 But then we can readFar Away and Long Ago so that at any rate from these factsof Argentine birthlong absence from this countryimmemorial antiquityquietude and the exact habit of mindwe may get certain glimpses of MrHudson s secretFor MrHudson is a secret and mysterious alchemist just as much asor much more thanDrDewarPerhapsowing to his Argentine birth and long racial absence from these IslandsMrHudson has escaped the infection of the slippysilly way we handle the languagehe has escaped the Authorized Version and the Morte d Arthur and someone s Rabelais and someone else s Montaigne and Sir Thomas Browne sUrn Burial and all the rest of it I may as well put down here what I meant when I said just now that Stephen Crane said the most illuminating thing I ever heard as to the English prose of to dayHe was talking about the author ofTravels in the Cevennes with MrColvinor whatever the title wasand he said By Godwhen Stevenson wrote With interjected finger he delayed the action of the time piece when he meanthe put the clock back Stevenson put back the clock of English fiction 150 yearsStevensonas you knowwas the sedulous ape of Walter Pater or someone like thatand decked himself out in allusionsborrowed wordsstolen metaphorsinversions and borrowed similes for all the world like Charles Lamb or a Tommy coming back to the Line hung about with souvenirs WellMrHudson has escaped all thatYou wouldas I have saidthink he had never read a book in his lifeCertainly he never read a book and carried off a phrase likeinterjected fingerto treasure it as Ole Bill might treasure an Iron Cross raped from the breast of General Humpfenstrumpfenlately deceasedThen tooborn in the Argentine in remote agesMrHudson had the advantage of seeing the light in a Latin country at least I suppose seventeenth century Argentina10 The Little Review was a Latin country and so he was among a population who used words for the expression of thoughtsForamong us Occidentalsit is only the Latin races who use words as clean toolsexactlywith decency and modestyYou may see the same in the prose of MrCunninghame Graham who was also of South American origin and is the only other true proseateur of these islandssince MrConrad writes not English but literal translations from unpublished French originals I suppose I ought to put in somewhere present company always exceptedfor the sake of politeness to possible readers And then againbeing the first of his family to visit England for 2 500 years or whatever it wasMrHudson has the advantage of being the first English writer to see this country for at least that periodJust as he has escaped our slippy use of the language so he has escaped our slippy way of looking at a hilla flowera birdan ivy leafYesterday 1 picked the first cuckoo flower and the first kingcup of the yearWhen I got my hand well on the stem of the first I exclaimed When lady smocks all silver white Do tint the meadows with delightI daresay I was misquotingbut I felt proud of myself and didn t look at the flowerWhen I grabbed the kingcup I said Shine like fire in swamps and hollows grey And I felt proud of myself and didn t look at the flowerWhen I hear my first skylark I shall spout Hail to thee blithe spiritBird thou never wastand for the nightingale it will be Most musicalmost melancholy and I shan t much look ator listen toeither fowlAnd it is the same with all us English writersFor again there is the question of this alchemist s great ageActually I believe MrHudson lately celebrated his seventieth birthdayI have however known him for twenty fivetwenty four or twenty The Little Review 11 three yearsand when I first met him he was eighty two and told personal anecdotes of the Court of George WashingtonWhat I mean by all this fantasia is that MrHudson has an air of consummate and unending permanence wherever he may happen to bea weather worn air as of an ancient treean ancient waga very old peasantWherever you find him he will seem to have been there for ages and to be time stained to the colour of the hedgerowsthe heatherthe downs or the country folkSo he fits in and treesbirdsor shepherds are natural when he is aboutMrHudson himself is conscious of the factfor he writes of Wiltshire in the opening pages of theShepherd s LifeOwing to a certain kind of adaptiveness in mea sense of being at home wherever the grass growsI am in a way a native of Wiltshire too And he is a native of Argentinaand La Plataand Patagonia and Hampshire and the Sussex downlands wherever the grass growsThat is perhaps the best gift that has been given to him by the Good God who has made him such a great poetFor simple peopleshepherdsbird catchersgirls wheeling perambulatorsold women cleaning front stonesSouth American Dictatorsgamblersduellistsbirdsbeasts and reptileshave been natural before himand the green earth and the sombre trees and the high downs and the vast Pampas have been just themselves before himHe looked at them with the intent gaze of the bird of prey and the abandonment of the perfect loverIVTwenty five years ago really twenty five years ago I lay on my back on the top of the great shoulder of the downs above Leweslooking into the crystalline blue of the skyThere drifted above me frailinnumerabletranslucentto an immense heightone shining above the otherlike an innumerable company of soap bubbles the globelike seeds of dandelionsmoving hardly perceptibly at all in the still sunlightIt was an unforgettable experience And yet it wasn t my experience at allI have never been on that particulai downs above Lewesthough I know the downs very wellAnd yet I am not lyingFor you seein the 90 s of last centuryI 12 The Little Review read that passage inNature in Downlandand it has become part of my lifeIt is as much part of my life as my first sight of the German lines from a down behind Albert in 1916which is about the most unforgettable of my own experiences in the fleshSo MrHudson has given me a part of my lifeIndeedI have a whole Hudson life alongside my ownand such great pleasure with itThat is what you mean when you say a man is a creatora creative artistHe gives to the world vicarious experienceAnd such immense pleasureI fancy that is really all there is to say or at any rate what most needs saying as to this very great manI believe thatuntil quite lately he was very little known in the Literary World in that coloured and fantastic cockpit where the Great Writers vote themselves orders or diplomassearchlight processionscenotaphsmilitary funeralsand whence lesser writers cut each other s throats for fourpence and go up to Heaven clinging to the coat tails of the aforesaid GreatButoutside that worldin the realm of the muteHudson must have had a great many readersI talk frequently with unlikely men in unlikely places with farriers in Francewith vicars in hideous North Country townswith doctors and chance people in mines about booksThe Great of course they won t have heard ofthe popular they will have read and will have forgotten or confusedBut if you mention Hudson and they happen to have read HudsonAhthen you will see a different expression on their facesYou will see them become animatedearnestwith eyes alive and with looks of affection as one does of some one who is greatkindwho has taught one a great dealwho is part of one s family and of oneself That is a very greata very splendid position to holdHudsonPoet Strayed into Science by Ezra Pound HUDSON S art begins where any man s art is felicitous in beginningin an enthusiasm for his subject matterIf we begin withThe Naturalist in La Platawe may find almost noartwhateverthere are impassioned passagesnaive literary homagesand much unevenness and a trace of rhetoric in the writing The Shepherd s Lifemustat the other end of the scalebe art of a very high orderhow otherwise would one come completely under the spell of a chapter with no more startling subject matter than the cat at a rural station of an undistinguished British provincial railwayHudson is an excellent example of Coleridge s theoremthe miracle that can be wroughtsimply by one man s feeling something more keenlyor knowing it more intimately than it has beenbeforeknownThe poet s eye and comprehension are evident in the first pages ofThe Naturalist the living effigies in bronze rising out of the white sea of the pampasThen the uneven eloquence And with the rhea go the flamingoantique and splendidand the swans in their bridal plumageand the rufous tinamou sweet and mournful melodist of the eventideand the noble crested screamer Theseand the other large avianstogether with the finest of its mammalianswill shortly be lost to the pampas utterlyWhat a wail there would be in the world if a sudden destruction were to fall on the accumulated arttreasures of the National Galleryand the marbles in the British Museumand the contents of the Kings Librarythe old prints and mediaeval illuminationsAnd these are only the work of human hands and brains impressions of 14 The Little Review individual genius on perishable materialimmortal only in the sense that the silken cocoon of the dead moth is sobecause they continue to exist and shine when the artist s hands and brain are dustand man has the long day of life before him in which to do again things like theseand better than theseif there is any truth in evolutionBut the forms of life in the two higher vertebrate classes are Nature s most perfect workand the life of even a single species is of incalculably greater value to mankindfor what it teaches and would continue to teachthan all the chiselled marbles and painted canvases the world containsthough doubtless there are many persons who are devoted to artbut blind to some things greater than artwho will set me down as a Philistine for saying so Andabove all otherswe should protect and hold sacred those typesNature s masterpieceswhich are first singled out for destruction on account of their sizeor splendouror rarityand that false detestable glory which is accorded to their successful slayersIn ancient times the spirit of life shone brightest in theseand when others that shared the earth with them were taken by deaththey were leftbeing more worthy of perpetuation One may put aside quibbles of precedencewhatever the value of evidence of man s finenessand in an age of pestilence like our own there is little but the great art of the past to convince one that the human species deserves to continuethere can be no quarrel between the archaeologist who wishes to hear themusic of the lost dynasty or the gracious tunes of the Albigeoiusand the man who is so filled with a passion of the splendour of wild thingsof wild birds which Like immortal flowers have drifted down to us on the ocean of timeand their strangeness and beauty bring to our imaginations a dream and a picture of that unknown worldimmeasurably far removedwhere man was notand when they perishsomething of gladness goes out The Little Review 15 from natureand the sunshine loses something of its brightness The voice is authenticIt is the priesthood of natureYet if an anthropologist may speak out of his pages to thenaturalist it is not only the bird and furred beast that sufferA bloated usurya cowardly and snivelling politicsa disgusting financial systemthe saddistic curse of Christianity work togethernot only that an hundred species of wild fowl and beast shall give way before the advance of industryie that the plains be covered with uniform and verminous sheepbleating in perfect social monotonybut in our allegedsocietythe same tendencies and the same urge that the bright plumed and the fine voiced species of the genus anthroposthe favoured of the godsthe only part of humanity worth savingis attackedThe milkable human cowsthe shearable human sheep are invited by the exploitersand all other regarded as caput iupinumdangerouslest the truth should shine out in artwhich ceases to be art and degenerates into religion and cant and superstition as soon as it has tax gathering priestslest works comparable to the Cretan vases and Assyrian lions should be reproduced and supersededThere is no quarrel between the artist and MrHudsonand he is right in saying that there would be morewailover the destruction of the British Museum than over the destruction of wild speciesYet how little thepubliccares for eitherAnd how can it be expected to care so long as so much of it isat starvation level so long as men are taught that work is a virtue rather than enjoymentand so long as men render lip service to a foul institution which has perpetuated the writing of Tertullien and of men who taught that the human body is evilAs long asChristendomis permeated with the superstition that the human body is tainted and that the senses are not noble avenues ofillumination where is the basis of a glory in the colour sense without which the birds wings are unapprehendedor of audition without which the bell cry of the crested screamers is only a noise in the desert 16 The Little Review Their strangeness and their beautymay well go unheeded into desuetude if there be nothing to preserve them but usurers and the slaves of usury and an alleged religion which has taught the supreme lie that the splendour of the world is not a true splendourthat it is not the garment of the godsand which has glorified the vilest of human imaginationsthe pit of the seven great stenchesand which still teaches the existence of this hell as a verity for the sake of scaring little children and stupid women and of collecting dues and maintaining its prestigeMy anger has perhaps carried me away from Hudson who should have been my subjectyet his anger is germane to itMediaeval Christianity had one meritit taught that usury was an evilBut in our day Rockefeller and the churches eat from the one mangerand the church has so far fallen into vacuity that it does not opposefinance which is nothing but a concatenation of usurieshardly subtlebut subtle enough to gull the sheep and cow humansAnd for the same system man is degradedand the wild beasts destroyedSo I have perhaps not lost my subject after allbut only extended my author s exordiumIIThe foregoing paragraphs can hardly be taken as introduction to MrHudson s quiet charmHe would lead us to South Americadespite the gnats and mosquitoes we would all perform the voyage for the sake of meeting a pumaChimbicâfriend of manthe most loyal of wildcatsAndas I am writing this presumably for an audiencemore or less familiar with my predilectionsfamiliar with my loathing of sheepmy continual search for signs of intelligence in the human raceit should be some indication of Hudson s style that it has carried even me through a volume entitledA Shepherd s Life a title which has no metaphorical bearingbut deals literally with the subject indicated Caleb s shepherding period in Doveton came to a somewhat sudden conclusionIt was nearing the end of August and he was beginning to think about the sheep which would The Little Review 17 have to be taken to theCastlesheep fair on 5th Octoberand it appeared strange to him etcJohn BYeats has written somewhere 1 found that I was interested in the talknot of those who told me interesting thingsso much as of those who were by natural gift truthful tellers a phrase which is as good a qualification of Hudson s work as I can findHudson s books are indeed full of interesting thingsof interestinginformation yet it is all information which couldlike all information whatsoeverhave been made dull in the tellingBut the charm is in Hudson s sobrietyI doubt ifapart from theMayor of Casterbridge andThe Noble Dames and the best of Hardythere is anything so true to the English countryside as Hudson s pictureFMHueffer must not be forgottenthere is hisHeart of the Country and passages in other of his books to maintain the leveland Hueffer is perhaps at his best when he approaches most closely to Hudson s subject matterwhen he is least cleverwhen he is most sober in his recording of country lifeThis is not however an arranging of hierarchies and an awarding of medals for meritHudson touches Hueffer when dealing with England and Cunninghame Graham in dealing with La PlataAnd it is very foolish to wail over the decadence of English letters merely because some of the best work of these three men is possibly ten years oldIt is perhaps faddism and habit that causes people still to gossip of PoewhenEl Ombuhas been writtennot as a grotesque but as tragic elegyas the ordered telling of life as it must have happenedAnd then Poe s prosePoe s prose is as good as Hudson s in placesand Hudson is indubitably unevenrelieved if not by hokkus at least by the sense of thespecial momentwhich makes the hokkuthus his trees like images of trees in black stoneThis image sense is an enrichmentperhapsdangerousto the unity of his stylebut very welcome to the lover of revelationAnd to balance it there is the latent and never absent humour as inMarta RiquelmeWhat isisand if you talk until to morrow you can not make it différentalthough you may prove yourself a very learned personWHHudson by John Rodker MRHUDSON is a great writerthough not always a perfect writerHis mask ofand his preoccupation withthenatural manwould have become in timeI do not doubtas tedious as Henry James s continual fuss with trivial relationshipshad not Hudson s entire output been so small that a week would be ample to get through it His lapsesovariotomised Burne Jones s maidensgood hearted bounderbut a perfect dear au fondthe natural man againtoo much exploited since by MrWellsa Blake likeFather of the Housebelong all to his novel A Crystal Age Other works are free from themfor Hudson sprang full armed into literature with a first novel The Purple Land somewhere in his thirtiesOne does not therefore talk about development when discussing MrHudsonEach new bookhowever different from its predecessoris yet well within his capacityFlaubertwho started withMadam Bovaryat about the same period in lifecan be definitely said to have developedbutThe Purple Landis in many ways more satisfying thanEl OmbûorA Crystal Age I do not know whenA Crystal Agewas writtenIt is magnificent and ingenuous in turnsits denouement appallingMrPound says somewhere that no tragedy is complete unless it be contrasted with an equally plausible happy endingHe should approve then of MrHudson who to the most violent tragedy opposes beatific probabilitiesBothA Crystal AgeandGreen Mansionscontain unnecessary and therefore tragical tragedy of a violence to stun the readerThe epilogue to Turgenev sFathers and Childrenseems to me most like themBoth writers have much in commonEach has the same ease in handling his mediumthe same limpidityeach the same confidence and kindlinessTheir brainstooare per I note that MrHudson had various scientific monographs on the flora and fauna of South America to his creditThe Little Review 19 fectly adequate but not quite such cutting instruments that they can take liberties with themIn England Hudson shares only with Conrad the laurels of writingBoth are foreignersIt should by now be an axiom that only foreigners can write a live EnglishTheir senses are not dulled by traditional thought formsNew institutions give them seriously to thinkTheir brains are brand new and respond immediately to the new lifeEnglish is four continents and what more natural than that they should be seduced into writing that languageConrad toois preoccupied with thenatural man a variant on theinspired idiotwhich certainly seems to be an indispensable ingredient in great literaturePerhaps this is whyboth being natural menthey see women stereoscopically very solid once planted planted for gooda tight little bomb of the best explosiveHer curious immobilitydreadingyearningfor the spark that will send her sky highAgainso easily is thenatural manidentified with one s own impulses that his mere bow from however remote a stage will send the gallery rockingLike that wasp who to paralyse his victim must sting it only at nine fixed placesand must therefore identify himself with itso MrHudson identifies his creationsand hisnatural menwith thelibidoof his readersMrHudson can therefore afford to do his writing on the generous sideIf the phrase will about dothat is good enoughThe things he wants to say are concrete thingsvital thingsand it follows necessarily that his writing will be vitalEverybody has seen these thingsor at any rate the next best thingHis job is rather to evoke pictures than to create themAnd once he has registered what he wants to note his interest lapsesWere MrHudson less of thenatural manhe would have created a conscious art rather than an inspired one an art not perhaps altogether satisfactorybut why quarrel with him because he does not want to write a temptation of Saint AnthonyIn his own person MrHudson points the moral of the vital decay in English letters during the last century the bored policeman and a life in towns being its probable causesCertain it is that only Mr20 The Little Review Cunninghame Graham or Conrad can be conceived of as writing the following passageremarkable only in its very palpablenatural manness For strangely enough I do not know even one war book which has had the vigour to say it likes killing either as retribution or for the fun of the thingHis hero has just killed a man who was about to disembowel him Joy at the terrible retribution I had been able to inflict on the murderous wretch was the only emotion I experienced when galloping away into the darkness such joy that I could have sung and shouted aloud had it not seemed imprudent to indulge in such expressions of feeling This is surely the authentic Billy Farnum touchThe Wild West endeared to an anaemic population with nothing on which to whet its appetitesIt is in another way Voltaire sL Ingénue High and low intelligences alike are seduced by itIndeed the natural man is our hippopotamusWe regard it as did Butler to our febrile brains infinitely restful in the deliberate processes of his growthhis solid grip on earthAnd when the natural man is projected upon vast flowing pampas or sea the effect is psychologically as well as physically bracingNew vitality flows inThe artist has tapped a natural spring which we feed ourselves continuallyThe difficulty then of forming an estimate of the work of MrHudson is insuperableAt every stage one is seduced by an instinctive delightAt the same timeand it may be unreasonablyone feels without knowing exactly where and when that MrHudson might have developed a keener insightwith more bitterness or ambition in his methodI myself feel always that however much Hudson gets out of his subject he does not quite get allIt is this irreducible residue which makes Hudson almost but never quite intense enoughOne does not feel this about TurgenevTchekhovConradIt is perhaps here that MrHudson s natural man is not natural enoughHe has become a little too unsophisticatedhis gaze has been withdrawn from his navel and now scans the skiesThat he can show these qualities is evidentfor there is a perfect chapter in the Art of Calculated Revenge inGreen Mansions but it appears to be a feeling of which he is ashamedIt does not occur againMr WHDavies who possessesbut in different proportionsthe qualiI The Little Review 21 ties of Hudsonby a goodd admixture of the qualities hateambitionetc conveys a denser impressionPerhaps the quality of ambition is not compatible with so absorbed an interest in the Brute Creation as MrHudson showsHe has spent so much time in proving them not dumbin a series of books each more charming than the last marvelling at the unanimity of their instinctstheir beauty and intelligencethat the study of man was neglectedIt is a study that may of course grow in intensity the more it is neglectedyour solitary being quite the most entertaining critic of manbut in this case it has made MrHudson too tolerant of man or too sorry for him to wish to scourge or flay himMen s treatment of the aigret inspires him to a noble furybut where man is concerned dare we say it MrHudson is too reasonableHe would no doubt reply that he has always detested vivisectionIt is illuminating to compare MrHudson with another naturalistMrFabreon the subject ofnatural selection that bugbear of biologyRemember that MrHudson was born seventy years agothat he attained manhood in the full flood of materialism HuxleySpencerand a world settling down to an implicit faith in DarwinismJust as before Copernicus men saw the universe as so many candles to light earthDarwin and his disciples saw in the brute creation so many adaptations and curious instincts which could be interpreted entirely anthromorphicallyFor instancewhen MrHudsondiscussing the habits of cattlesuggests that the dying animal is killed by the herd in a panic stricken attempt to save it from the clutches of an invisible enemyhe is only too reasonableBut surely this very reasonableness is in itself suspectA human explanation will satisfy a human mindbut one wants something more convincingObviouslysince we have only our mindsthere is no means of knowing save only by that community of instinct which enables the wasp to sting its caterpillar in nine placesand those the only possible nine placesA reason which is as good an explanation as that will alone satisfy usOur tribute to MrHudson must be that his reasons are always amazingly plausible and show a great wealth of poetic visionAgain MrHudsonWhy or how animals come to be possessed of the power of emit 22 The Little Review ting pestiferous odours is a mysterywe only see that natural selection has in some instanceschiefly among insects taken advantage of it to furnish some of the weakermore unprotected species with a means of escape from their enemies This is very cautiousbut even so the converse of the proposition is equally truebut one has to realise how very important a credo was the Darwinian theory to our fathersto understand how harsh a tyranny it exerted on even the best mindsHear Fabre on the same subject not so much the natural manhe was the enraged scientistHis tribute was to stand five hours in a boiling sun feeding a wasp with caterpillarsHis experiments with insects were holocaustsyet with what scorn he speaks of the vivisectorCuriosity only will explain his keennessthough he was not blind to aesthetic aspects in his insectsWhereas Hudson started on his researches lured by the beautiful and interesting the literary man s science Fabre started with an insane curiosity in the insectCertainly Fabre s seems the more vital impulse Pour ces motifs et bien d autresje repousse la théorie moderne de l instinctJe n y vois qu un jet d esprit

usRiding on the pampas one dark evening an hour after sunsetand passing from high ground overgrown with giant thistles to a low plain covered with long grassbordering a stream of waterI found it all ablaze with myriads of firefliesI noticed that all the insects gave out an exceptionally large brilliant lightwhich shone almost steadilyThe long grass was thickly studded with themwhile they literally swarmed in the airall moving up the valley with a singularly slow and languid flightWhen I galloped down into this river of phosphorescent firemy horse plunged and snorted with alarmI succeeded at length in quieting himand then rode slowly throughcompelled to keep my mouth and eyes closedso thickly did the insects rain on to my faceThe air was laden with the sickening phosphorus

I have said about MrHudson s incapacity for viceOn the other handthese stories have not the inevitability of the great storybut they are the next best thingsThey contain quite amazing paragraphs It

Solomon and sensual pantomine made a taut stage of his faceWhen not reading the Songs of Solomon he was as staidly poised as a monk s folded armsHe had borrowed the colours of his life from that

remarkas I had not questioned his attachment to the woman he had marriedWe walked for ten minutes and then he said it againI turned to look at himHe began to talk and told me the tale I am now about to set downThe thing he had on his mind happened during what must have been the most eventful week of his lifeHe was to be married on Friday afternoonOn Friday of the week before he got a telegram announcing his appointment to a government positionSomething else happened that made him very proud and gladIn secret he was in the habit of writing verses and during the year before several of them had been printed in poetry magazinesOne of the societies that give prizes for what they think the best poems published during the year put his name at the head of their listThe story of his triumph was printed in the newspapers of his home cityand one of them also printed his pictureAs might have been expectedhe was excited and in a rather highly strung nervous state all during that weekAlmost every evening he went to call on his fiancéethe daughter of a judgeWhen he got there the house was filled with people and many letterstelegrams and packages were being receivedHe stood a little to one side and men and women kept coming to speak with himThey congratulated him upon his success in getting the government position and on his achievement as a poetEveryone seemed to be praising himand when he went home to bed he could not sleepOn Wednesday evening he went to the theatre and it seemed to him that people all over the house recognized himEveryone nodded and smiledAfter the first act five or six men and two women left their seats to gather about himA little group was formedStrangers sitting along the same row of seats stretched their necks and lookedHe had never received so much attention beforeand now a fever of expectancy took possession of him38 The Little Review As he explained when he told me of his experienceit was for him an altogether abnormal timeHe felt like one floating in airWhen he got into bed after seeing so many people and hearing so many words of praise his head whirled round and roundWhen he closed his eyes a crowd of people invaded his roomIt seemed as though the minds of all the people of his city were centered on himselfThe most absurd fancies took possession of himHe imagined himself riding in a carriage through the streets of a cityWindows were thrown open and people ran out at the doors of houses There he isThat s him they shoutedand at the words a glad cry aroseThe carriage drove into a street blocked with peopleA hundred thousand pairs of eyes looked up at him There you areWhat a fellow you have managed to make of yourself the eyes seemed to be sayingMy friend could not explain whether the excitement of the people was due to the fact that he had written a new poem or whetherin his new government positionhe had performed some notable actThe apartment where he lived at that time was on a street perched along the top of a cliff far out at the edge of the city and from his bedroom window he could look down over trees and factory roofs to a riverAs he could not sleep and as the fancies that kept crowding in upon him only made him more excitedhe got out of bed and tried to thinkAs would be natural under such circumstanceshe tried to control his thoughtsbut when he sat by the window and was wide awake a most unexpected and humiliating thing happenedThe night was clear and fineThere was a moonHe wanted to dream of the woman who was to be his wifethink out lines for noble poems or make plans that would affect his careerMuch to his surprise his mind refused to do anything of the sortAt a corner of the street where he lived there was a small cigar store and newspaper stand run by a fat man of forty and his wifea small active woman with bright grey eyesIn the morning he stopped there to buy a paper before going down to the citySometimes he saw only the fat manbut often the man had disappeared and the woman waited on himShe wasas he assured me at least twenty times in telling me his talea very ordinary person with nothing The Little Review 39 special or notable about herbut for some reason he could not explain being in her presence stirred him profoundlyDuring that week in the midst of his distraction she was the only person he knew who stood out clear and distinct in his mindWhen he wanted so much to think noble thoughtshe could think only of herBefore he knew what was happening his imagination had taken hold of the notion of having a love affair with the woman I could not understand myself he declaredin telling me the story At nightwhen the city was quiet and when I should have been asleepI thought about her all the timeAfter two or three days of that sort of thing the consciousness of her got into my daytime thoughtsI was terribly muddledWhen I went to see the woman who is now my wife I found that my love for her was in no way affected by my vagrant thoughtsThere was but one woman in the world I wanted to live with me and to be my comrade in undertaking to improve my own character and my position in the worldbut for the momentyou seeI wanted this other woman to be in my armsShe had worked her way into my beingOn all sides people were saying I was a big man who would do big thingsand there I wasThat evening when I went to the theatre I walked home because I knew I would be unable to sleepand to satisfy the annoying impulse in myself I went and stood on the sidewalk before the tobacco shopIt was a two story buildingand I knew the woman lived upstairs with her husbandFor a long time I stood in the darkness with my body pressed against the wall of the building and then I thought of the two of them up thereno doubt in bed togetherThat made me furious Then I grew more furious at myselfI went home and got into bed shaken with angerThere are certain books of verse and some prose writings that have always moved me deeplyand so I put several books on a table by my bed The voices in the books were like the voices of the deadI did not hear themThe words printed on the lines would not penetrate into my consciousnessI tried to think of the woman I lovedbut her figure had also become something far awaysomething with which I for the moment seemed to have nothing to doI rolled and tumbled 40 The Little Review about in the bedIt was a miserable experience On Thursday morning I went into the storeThere stood the woman aloneI think she knew how I feltPerhaps she had been thinking of me as I had been thinking of herA doubtful hesitating smile played about the corners of her mouthShe had on a dress made of cheap clothand there was a tear on the shoulderShe must have been ten years older than myselfWhen I tried to put my pennies on the glass counter behind which she stood my hand trembled so that the pennies made a sharp rattling noiseWhen I spoke the voice that came out of my throat did not sound like anything that had ever belonged to meIt barely arose above a thick whisper I want you I said I want you very muchCan t you run away from your husbandCome to me at my apartment at seven tonightThe woman did come to my apartment at sevenThat morning she did not say anything at allFor a minute perhaps we stood looking at each otherI had forgotten everything in the world but just herThen she nodded her head and I went awayNow that I think of it I cannot remember a word I ever heard her sayShe came to my apartment at seven and it was darkYou must understand this was in the month of OctoberI had not lighted a light and I had sent my servant away During that day I was no good at allSeveral men came to see me at my officebut I got all muddled up in trying to talk with themThey attributed my rattle headedness to my approaching marriage and went away laughing It was on that morningjust the day before my marriagethat I got a long and very beautiful letter from my fiancéeDuring the night before she also had been unable to sleep and had got out of bed to write the letterEverything she said in it was very sharp and realbut she herselfas a living thingseemed to have receded into the distanceIt seemed to me that she was like a birdflying far away in distant skiesand I was like a perplexed bare footed boy standing in the dusty road before a farm house and looking at her receding figureI wonder if you will understand what I mean In regard to the letterIn it shethe awakening womanpoured The Little Review 41 out her heartShe of course knew nothing of lifebut she was a womanShe lay1 supposein her bed feeling nervous and wrought up as I had been doingShe realized that a great change was about to take place in her life and was glad and afraid tooThere she lay thinking of it allThen she got out of bed and began talking to me on the bit of paperShe told me how afraid she was and how glad tooLike most young women she had heard things whisperedIn the letter she was very sweet and fine For a long timeafter we are marriedwe will forget we are a man and woman she wrote We will be human beingsYou must remember that I am ignorant and often I will be very stupidYou must love me and be very patient and kindWhen I know morewhen after a long time you have taught me the way of lifeI will try to repay youI will love you tenderly and passionatelyThe possibility of that is in meor I would not want to marry at allI am afraid but I am also happyOI am so glad our marriage time is near at handNow you see clearly enough into what a mess I had gotIn my officeafter I had read my fiancee s letterI became at once very resolute and strongI remember that I got out of my chair and walked aboutproud of the fact that I was to be the husband of so noble a womanRight away I felt concerning her as I had been feeling about myself before I found out what a weak thing I wasTo be sure I took a strong resolution that I would not be weakAt nine that evening I had planned to run in to see my fiancée I m all right now I said to myself The beauty of her character has saved me from myselfI will go home now and send rhe other woman away In the morning I had telephoned to my servant and told him that I did not want him to be at the apartment that evening and I now picked up the telephone to tell him to stay at home Then a thought came to me I will not want him there in any event I told myself What will he think when he sees a woman coming to my place on the evening before the day I am to be married I put the telephone down and prepared to go home If I want my servant out of the apartment it is because I do not want him to hear me talk with the womanI cannot be rude to herI will have to make some kind of an explanation I said to myself 42 The Little Review The woman came at seven o clockandas you may have guessedI let her in and forgot the resolution I had madeIt is likely I never had any intention of doing anything elseThere was a bell on my doorbut she did not ringbut knocked very softlyIt seems to me that everything she did that evening was soft and quiet but very determined and quickDo I make myself clearWhen she came I was standing just within the doorwhere I had been standing and waiting for a half hourMy hands were trembling as they had trembled in the morning when her eyes looked at me and when I tried to put the pennies on the counter in the storeWhen I opened the door she stepped quickly in and I took her into my armsWe stood together in the darknessMy hands no longer trembledI felt very happy and strong Although I have tried to make everything clear I have not told you what the woman I married is likeI have emphasizedyou seethe other womanI make the blind statement that I love my wifeand to a man of your shrewdness that means nothing at allTo tell the truthhad I not started to speak of this matter I would feel more comfortableIt is inevitable that I give you the impression that I am in love with the tobacconist s wifeThat s not trueTo be sure I was very conscious of her all during the week before my marriagebut after she had come to me at my apartment she went entirely out of my mind Am I telling the truthI am trying very hard to tell what happened to meI am saying that I have not since that evening thought of the woman who came to my apartmentNowto tell the facts of the casethat is not trueOn that evening I went to my fiancée at nineas she had asked me to do in her letterIn a kind of way I cannot explain the other woman went with meThis is what I mean you see I had been thinking that if anything happened between me and the tobacconist s wife I would not be able to go through with my marriage It is one thing or the other with me I had said to myself As a matter of fact I went to see my beloved on that evening filled with a new faith in the outcome of our life togetherI am afraid I muddle this matter in trying to tell itA moment ago I said The Little Review 43 the other womanthe tobacconist s wifewent with meI do not mean she went in factWhat I am trying to say is that something of her faith in her own desires and her courage in seeing things through went with meIs that clear to youWhen I got to my fiancee s house there was a crowd of people standing aboutSome were relatives from distant places I had not seen beforeShe looked up quickly when I came into the roomMy face must have been radiantI never saw her so movedShe thought her letter had affected me deeplyand of course it hadUp she jumped and ran to meet meShe was like a glad childRight before the people who turned and looked inquiringly at usshe said the thing that was in her mind OI am so happy she cried You have understoodWe will be two human beingsWe will not have to be husband and wifeAs you may supposeeveryone laughedbut I did not laughThe tears came into my eyesI was so happy I wanted to shoutPerhaps you understand what I meanIn the office that day when I read the letter my fiancée had written I had said to myself I will take care of the dear little woman There was something smugyou seeabout thatIn her house when she cried out in that wayand when everyone laughedwhat I said to myself was something like this We will take care of ourselves I whispered something of the sort into her earsTo tell you the truth I had come down off my perchThe spirit of the other woman did that to meBefore all the people gathered about I held my fiancée close and we kissedThey thought it very sweet of us to be so affected at the sight of each otherWhat they would have thought had they known the truth about me God only knows Twice now I have said that after that evening I never thought of the other woman at allThat is partially true but sometimes in the evening when I am walking alone in the street or in the park as we are walking nowand when evening comes softly and quickly as it has come to nightthe feeling of her comes sharply into my body and mindAfter that one meeting I never saw her againOn the next day I was married and I have never gone back into her streetOften however as I am walking along as I am doing nowa quick 44 The Little Review sharp earthy feeling takes possession of meIt is as though I were a seed in the ground and the warm rains of the spring had comeIt is as though I were not a man but a tree And now you see I am married and everything is all rightMy marriage is to me a very beautiful factIf you were to say that my marriage is not a happy one I could call you a liar and be speaking the absolute truthI have tried to tell you about this other womanThere is a kind of relief in speaking of herI have never done it beforeI wonder why I was so silly as to be afraid that I would give you the impression I am not in love with my wifeIf I did not instinctively trust your understanding I would not have spokenAs the matter stands I have a little stirred myself upTo night I shall think of the other womanThat sometimes occursIt will happen after I have gone to bedMy wife sleeps in the next room to mine and the door is always left openThere will be a moon to nightand when there is a moon long streaks of light fall on her bedI shall awake at midnight to nightShe will be lying asleep with one arm thrown over her head What is it that I am now talking aboutA man does not speak of his wife lying in bedWhat I am trying so say is thatbecause of this talkI shall think of the other woman to nightMy thoughts will not take the form they did during the week before I was marriedI will wonder what has become of the womanFor a moment I will again feel myself holding her closeI will think that for an hour I was closer to her than I have ever been to anyone elseThen I will think of the time when I will be as close as that to my wifeShe is stillyou seean awakening womanFor a moment I will close my eyes and the quickshrewddetermined eyes of that other woman will look into mineMy head will swim and then I will quickly open my eyes and see again the dear woman with whom I have undertaken to live out my lifeThen I will sleep and when I awake in the morning it will be as it was that evening when I walked out of my dark apartment after having had the most notable experience of my lifeWhat I mean to

by Maxwell BodenheimI wish that the word sincerity could be dropped from the languagetake the sincerity of the artistIt is not his business to be exact about lifethe reality of things is not his concern jh in the Little ReviewI wish that the word insincerity could be dropped form the languageOnly inanimate objects are sincerebecause they never attempt to explain themselvesIn a world animated by insinceritythe word insincerity should be discarded with all other glaringly apparent symbolsbut the word sincerity should be retainedThe latter is threadbare but holds the fantastic virtuesUp to date I have met a writera street car conductor and a girl working in a The Little Review 51 textile mill who were sincereI would not even vouch for their sincerity but I have considered it as a fascinating plausibilityThese three people were not exact about life and the reality of things did not concern thembut this does not affect their possible sincerityTheir wordsgesturesfacial

with a would be brilliant wordor vice versaand when they scratched their heads a genuinedominating doubt made their finger nails methodicalThe factory girl did not go to church on Sundays because Someone had made her flat footed and she refused to recognise the general goodness of his intentions until he corrected his errorShe wore pink waists because they reminded her of strawberries her favorite fruit and when I told her that strawberries seemed to be red she placidly informed me that they were pink when they flavored ice creamWhen a wagon almost ran over her it left its aftermaths

Review Chana Orloff by Muriel Ciolkowska ParisApril1920MADAME Chana Orloff s wooden statuette of anAmazonewas on view at the Salon des Independentsthe thirty third held by this society since the war and one of the most remarkable in its annalsThe same artist had sentalsothe group ofDanseuses aMaternité and aFemme Enceinte Among these the last named departedin my opinionfrom the spirit which impelled the three othersIt wasat any ratein contradiction with themand if it was right the others were wrong or visa versaTheFemme Enceintewas deficient in that exquisite witspontaneous fancyfeminine feeling and originality evidenced in the Woman on Horsebackin thatMaternitéwhichfailing a photographit is most regrettably impossible to reproduce hereTheFemme Enceinte on the other hand is the negative outcome of cold calculationa type of that impoverished brain work which is met with among certaincubistsand other unimaginative theorists who would compensate want of inspiration by contempt for itsubstituting ruse for intelligence by an appearance of scientific interventionTheAmazone being reproduced heredoes not require descriptionI mayneverthelessbe permitted to point out delicate flexibilities in the rider s figure and the horse s neck which are distinctly of a feminine characterIn a totally different form similar finesse distinguished the work of one of France s greatest

must have been glad to get rid of the lodgers and have possession of the whole houseYessaid MrsBailey straightening the sideboard clothHearty agreement about the advantages and disadvantages of boarders and thenI think it s very plucky of you and away upstairsA few words about the interest of having boarders to begin getting to the door with The Irishman s an interesting specimen of humanityIsn t he interesting laughed MrsBailey moving further into the room It s much more interesting to have boarders than lodgerssaid Miriam moving along the pathway of freedom towards the open doorMrsBailey stood silentwatching politelyThere was no way outMrsBailey s presence would be waiting in the halland upstairsunappeasedMiriam glanced towards her without meeting her eyes and sat limply down on the nearest chair Phoo it s rather a relief she murmuredMrsBailey went briskly to the door and closed it and came freely back into the rooma litle exacting figure who had seen all her selfish rejoicingShe would get up now and walk about the roomtalking easily and eloquently about Eleanor s charm and go away leaving MrsBailey mystified and disposed of My worddeclared MrsBailey tweaking the window curtainsThen Bailey was ready and anxious to talk her overAfter seeming to like her so much and being so attentive and sending her off so gaily and kindlyshe had some grievanceIt was not the billIt was a matter of opinionMrsBailey had been charmed and had yet seen through herSeen whatWhat was the everlasting secret of EleanorShe imagined them standing talking togetherpolitely 54 The Little Review and joking and laughingMrsBailey would like Eleanor s jokesthey would be in agreement with her own opinions about thingsBut she had formed some idea of her and was ready to express itIf it explained anything one would have to accept itfrom MrsBaileyTo make nice general remarks about her and enquire insincerely about the bill would be never to get MrsBailey s uninfluenced opinionShe would not give it unless she were asked I m awfully sorry for her she said in Eve s voiceThat would mean just her poverty and her few clothes and delicate healthThere could be an insincere discussionIt might end in nothing and the mean selfish joy would still be waiting unstairs as soon as one had forgotten that it was mean and selfish So am Isaid MrsBailey heartilyThere was anger in her faceThere really was somethingsome really bad opinion about EleanorMrsBailey thought these things more important than joyful freedomShe was one of those people who would do thingsthen there were other people toothen one need not trouble about what it was or warn people against EleanorThe world would find out and protect itselfpassing her onIf MrsBailey felt there was something wrongno one need feel blamed for thinking soThere wasWhat was it I m the last to be down on anyone in difficulties said MrsBailey Oh yes It was coming It s the way of people I look to She stoppedIf she were not pressed she would say no more Ohby the wayMrsBaileyhas her bill been settled The voice of MrsLionelshe s unsquashable my dearabsolutely unsquashableYou never saw anything like it in your lifeBut she s

thought about thatNoI seeIt s the way of people The Little Review 55Well you know I told you at once that you must have her here at your own risk after the first weekand that I hardly knew anything about her If she had paid the two weeks so easily perhaps MrTaunton was still looking after her needsNoShe would have mentioned himHe had dropped her entirelyafter all he had said I m not blaming youyoung lady Perhaps MrsBailey had offered advice and been rebuffed in some wayThere would be some mysterious description of characterlike the Norwegianselfish in a way I couldn t describe to youIf I d known what it was going to be I d not have had her in the house two days some manwho but they were out all day and Eleanor had been with her every eveningBesides MrsBailey would sympathise with thatShe was furiously angry not two days But she had been charmedCharmed and admiring Did she flirt with some oneThatsaid MrsBailey gravely I can t tell youShe may havethat s her own affairI wouldn t necessary blame herEveryone s free to do as they like provided they behave themselves MrsBailey was brushing at her skirt with downcast eyesThis woman had opened Drvon Heber s letterknew he was coming

and seemed delightedand when I asked her about it later she cried and said she hadn t beenI said she must do something and then suddenly this case appearedWhere I don t knowI don t blame her for not

about Rupert Streetand the detectiveShe would have it in her mind like a novel and never let it goIt would be a breach of confidence She pausednot knowing what to do with her sudden animationIt was too late to get back into being an impartial listeneron the verge of going awayShe had told everythingwithout the interesting detailsMrsBailey was waiting for themThey were still safeShe might think it was an illness or something about a relativeThe only thing to do now was to stay and work off the unexplained animation on anything MrsBailey might choose to say Wellsaid MrsBailey presently to return to our friendWhat I say iswhy doesn t she go to the clergyin her own parishGo on the parishm mNot necessarily on the parishThe clergy s most helpful and sympatheticThey might tell her of those who would help herThey mightBut it s most awfully difficultNobody knows what ought to be done about these thingsThat is soBut there s a right and a wrong in everythingThere s plenty of people willing

fane beside the waves after the storms of this weary worldkneeling before the feet of the immaculatebeseeching her to intercede for themholy Maryholy virgin of virginsHow sad to poor Gerry s earsHad her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink she might now be rolling in her carriagesecond to noneOver and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study or gazing out of the window by the hour at the rain falling on the 62 The Little Review rusty bucketBut that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearts and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood daysNayshe had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own fathera prey to the fumes of intoxicationforget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the lowAnd still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerfulvirgin most mercifulAnd Gertywrapt in thoughtscarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walkYou never saw him anyway screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for father because he was too old or something or on account of his faceit was a palpable case of doctor Fellor his carbuncly nose with the pimples on itPoor fatherWith all his faults she loved him still when he sang Tell meMaryhow to woo thee and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with salad dressing for supper and when he sang The moon hath raised with MrDignam that died suddenly and was buriedGod have mercy on himfrom a strokeHer mother s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and MrDignam and Mrsand Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group takenNo one would have thought the end was so nearNow he was laid to restAnd her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn t even go to the funeral on account of the goutand she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby s cork lineartistic designsfit for a palacegives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the homeA sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the housea ministering angel tooAnd when her mother had those splitting headaches who was it rubbed on the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn t like her mother taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about The Little Review 63 taking snuffIt was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place MrTunney the grocer s christmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his lady love with oldtime chivalry through her lattice windowThe colours were done something lovelyShe was in a soft clinging white and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocratShe often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker s pronouncing dictionary about the halcyon days what they meantThe twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashiontill at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocksNeedless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came to the rescue and intercepted the ballOur two champions claimed their play thing with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her pleaseThe gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty s skirt near the little pool by the rockThe twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it way and let them fight for itso Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed If you fail try againEdy Boardman saidGerty smiled assentA delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shinglePure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite lookingShe felt the warm flusha danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell64 The Little Review surging and flaming into her cheeksTill then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilightwan and strangely drawnseemed to her the saddest she had ever seenThrough the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sinspiritual vesselpray for ushonourable vesselpray for usvessel of singular devotionpray for usmystical roseAnd careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wanderedtheir eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Marythe most pious virgin s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by herThe twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as passing summer showersCissy played with baby Boardman till he crowed with gleeclapping baby hands in airPeep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ahandmy worddidn t the little chap enjoy thatAnd then she told him to say papa Say papababysay pa pa pa pa pa pa paAnd baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and he would certainly turn out to be something great they said Haja ja ja hajaGerty wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried outholy saint Denisthat he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under himOf course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaaIt was all no use soothering him with nononobaby and telling The Little Review 65 him all about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Cissalways readywittedgave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeasedGerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of thatno hour to be outand the little brats of twinsShe gazed out towards the distant seaIt was like a picture the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the churchAnd while she gazed her heart went pitapatYesit was her he was looking at and there was meaning in his lookHis eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and throughread her very soulWonderful eyes they weresuperbly expressivebut could you trust themShe could see at once by his dark eyes that he was a foreigner but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose from where he was sittingHe was in deep mourningshe could see thatand the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his faceShe would have given worlds to know what it wasHe was looking up so intenselyso still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfullyShe was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far awayHere was that of which she had so often dreamedThe heart of the girl woman went out to himIf he had sufferedmore sinned against than sinningor evenevenif he had been himself a sinnera wicked manshe cared notThere were wounds that wanted healing and she just yearned to know allto forgive all if she could make him fall in love with hermake him forget the memory of the pastThen mayhap he would embrace her gentlycrushing her soft body to him and love her for herself aloneRefuge of sinnersComfortess of the afflictedOra pro nobisWell has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast awayand fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heartGerty could picture the whole scene in the churchthe stained glass windows lighted upthe candlesthe flowers and the 66 The Little Review blue banner of the blessed virgin s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O Hanlon at the altarcarrying things in and out with his eyes cast downHe looked almost a saint and his confession box was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white waxHe told her that time when she told him about that in confession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could seenot to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature s lawshe said in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by Godhe saidand that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy WordHe was so kind and holy and often and often she thought could she work an embroidered teacosy for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canary that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hoursadoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some placeThe little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after itLittle monkeys common as ditchwaterSomeone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both of themAnd Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned JackyTommyNot theyWhat a great notion they hadSo Cissy said it was the very last time she d ever bring them outShe jumped up and called and then she ran down the slope past himtossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing in to it she couldn t get it to grow long because it wasn t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at itShe ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to The Little Review 67 show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat runningand her skinny shanks up as far as possibleIt would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something with her high French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumbleThat would have been a very charming expose for a gentleman like that to witnessQueen of angelsqueen of patriarchsqueen of prophetsof all saintsthey prayedqueen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a good clip on the ear but she didn t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing Tantum ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time to the Tantumer gosa cramen tumThree and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow s of George s street on the Tuesdayno the Monday before easter and there wasn t a brack on them and that was what he was looking attransparentand not at hers that had neither shape nor form because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himselfCissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her on one side after her run and she did look like a streel tugging the two kids along with the blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her backGerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettiera daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl s shouldera radiant little visionin soothalmost maddening in its sweetnessYou would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of thatShe could almost see the swift answering flush of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerveShe put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she 68 The Little Review caught the expression in his eyesHe was eyeing her as a snake eyes its preyHer woman s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious roseEdy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gertyhalf smiling with her specslike an old maidpretending to nurse the babyIrritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no one could get on with herpoking her nose into what was no concern of hersAnd she said to Gerty A penny for your thoughts Whatlaughed GertyI was only wondering was it lateBecause she wished to goodness they d take the snotty nosed twins and their baby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being lateAnd when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissyas glib as you likesaid it was half past kissing timetime to kiss againBut Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early Waitsaid CissyI ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what s the time by his conundrumSo over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocketgetting nervous and beginning to play with his watchchainlooking at the churchPassionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himselfOne moment he had been therefascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentlmansclfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguished looking figureCissy said to excuse her would he mind telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to it and looking up and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was setHis voice had a cultured ring in it and there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tonesCissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said his waterworks were out of orderThen they sang the second verse of the Tantum ergo and Canon O Hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just The Little Review 69 going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in timeIt was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pocketsShe felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moonHis dark eyes fixed themselves on her againdrinking in her every contourliterally worshipping at her shrineIf ever there was undisguised admiration in a man s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man s faceIt is for youGertrude MacDowelland you know itEdy began to get ready to go and she noticed that that little hint she gave had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twinscaps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out Panem de coelo praestitisti eis and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her overGerty winced sharplyA brief cold blaze shot from her eyes that spoke of scorn immeasurableIt hurt O yesit cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she wasGerty s lips parted swiftly but she fought back the sob that rose to her throatso slimso flawlessso beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed ofShe had loved him better than he knewLighthearted deceived and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tearsTheir eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled 70 The Little Review back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see Oshe laughed and the proud head flashed upI can throw my cap at who I like because it s leap yearHer words rang out crystal clearmore musical than the cooing of the ringdove but they cut the silence icilyThere was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled withMiss Edy s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage because that shaft had struck home and they both knew that she was something aloofapart in another spherethat she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke itEdy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior and Cissy told him too that Billy Winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too duckylaughing up out of his gleeful eyesand Cissy poked him like that out of fun in hihs wee fat tummy and babywithout as much as by your leavesent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brand new dribbling bib O myPuddney pieprotested CissThe slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rightsGerty stifled a smothered exclamation and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round him round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his handsHow moving the scene there in the gathering twilightthe last glimpse of Erinthe touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the duskhitherthitherwith a tiny lost cryAnd she could see far away the The Little Review 71 lights of the lighthouses and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn the bicycle like she read in that book The Lamplighter by Miss Cumminsauthor of Mabel Vaughan and other talesFor Gerty had her dreams that no one knew ofShe loved to read poetry and she got a keepsake from Berha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of toilet table which though it did not err on the side of luxurywas scrupulously neat and cleanIt was there she kept her girlish treasure trove the tortoiseshell combsher child of Mary badgethe whiterose scentthe eyebrowleineher alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Wisdom Hesly s for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs Art thou realmy idealit was called by Louis JWalsheMagherafeltand after there was something about twilightwilt thou everand often the beauty of poetryso sad in its transient loveliness had misted her eyes with silent tears that the years were slipping by for herone by oneand but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down the hill and she always tried to conceal itBut it must end she feltIf she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for herLove laughs at locksmithsShe would make the great sacrificeDearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happinessThere was the all important question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhousecruel only to be kindBut even if what thenWould it make a very great differenceFrom everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiledShe loathed that sort of personthe fallen woman off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse mendegrading the sex and being taken up to the police stationNono 72 The Little Review not thatThey would be

keeping company with all those Barn shadows with which you so forcefully enshroud your pictureOf course it is a picture not a study of some of that morbidity which is so prevalent during these days of

must be helped alongThenyou might become of some real worth in life s longhard battle and helpwhere you now simply waste your time and your gift There is something batrachian in the above comment and

longer to beoriginalstrangecompelling that even in the end they seek fame by exhibiting their discardingsjh The Modest Woman Helen Bishop DennisBostonI notice that the first letter under the Reader Critic in your April issue suggests thatafter all these months James Joyce might be acceptedobscenity and allfor only a few read himand those few not just the kind to have their whole moral natures overthrown by frankness about natural functions The mistake you people make is in thinking that weprudeswho don t like Joyce are concerned with moralsMorality has nothing to do with itDoes morality have anything to do with the average person s desire for privacy concerning thenatural functions Not at allit 74 The Little Review is delicacylack of vulgarityI do not think we need to apologize for this delicacy and lack of vulgarityeven to your superior beingsThere is a certain form of mental unbalance about the lowest formthat takes delight in concentration on thenatural functionsAll attendants in insane asylums are familiar with itDoes James Joyce belong to those so affectedDothe few who read himbelongIf notand Joyce and his readers are to be considered fairly sanewould he and they be willing to perform theirnatural functionsin publicIf notwhy take out a desire for dabbling in filthin writing in publicThe only cure for the nausea he causes is the thought thatonly a few read
