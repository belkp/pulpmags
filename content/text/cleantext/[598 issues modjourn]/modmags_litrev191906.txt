by Dorothy Richardson Chapter One MIRIAM thumped down her Gladstone bag on to the doorstepStout boots hurried along the tiled passage and the door opened on Florrie Broom in her outdoor clothes smiling brilliantly from under the wide brim of a heavily trimmed hatGrace in a large straight green dress appeared beside her from the open dining room doorMiriam finished her fantasia with the door knocker while Florrie bent to secure her bag saying on a choke of laughtercome inYou ve just been outsaid Miriam listening to Grace s eager reproaches for her latenessShall I come in or shall I burst into tears and sit down on the doorstepFlorrie laughed aloudstanding with the bagBring her in scolded MrsPhilps from the dining room doorGrace took her by the arm and drew her along the passageI m one mass of mudNever mind the mudcome in put of the rainscolded MrsPhilps backing towards the fireyou must be worn outNoI don t feel that now I m hereoh what a heavenly fireMiriam heard the front door shut with a shallow suburban slam and got herself round the supper table to stand with MrsPhilps on the hearthrug and smile into the fireMrsPhilps patted her arm and cheekIs the door really shut O Hara said Miriam turning to Florrie coming into the room Of coursechoked Florrie coming to the hearthrug to pat herI ll put the chain up if you likeSit down and rest before you go upstairssaid MrsPhilps propelling her gently backwards into the largest of the velvet armchairsIts back sloped away from herthe large square cushion bulging out the lower half of the long woolen antimacassar prevented her from getting comfortably into the chairShe sat on the summit of the spring and said it was not coldWouldn t you like to come up before supper suggested Grace in answer to her uneasy gazing into the fireWell I feel rather grubbyGive her The Little Review some hot water murmured MrsPhilps taking up the Daily TelegraphGrace preceded her up the little staircase carrying her bagWill you have your milk hot or cold Miriamcalled Florrie from below Ohhot I think pleaseI shan t be a second said Miriam into the spare roomhoping to be leftGrace turned up the gasM m darling she murmured with timid gentle kissesI m so glad you have comeSo am IIt s glorious to be safely hereI shan t be a secondI ll come down as I am and appear radiant tomorrow You re always radiant I m simply grubbyI

hat by yetWe ve got three clear days All rightoh my dear you don t know how glad I am I m here Grace came back murmuring from the door to repeat the gentle kissesWhen the door was shut the freshness and quietude of the room enfolded Miriamcleansing away grubbiness and fatigueOpening her Gladstone bag she threw on to the bed her new cream nun s veiling blouse and lace tieher brushbag and sponge bag and shoes and a volume of Schiller and a bundle of note paper and envelopesA night gown was put ready for her on the bed frilled in an old fashioned way with hand made embroideryHer bag went under the bed for nearly four daysNothing grubby anywhereNo and tie looked quite bright under the gaslight screend by the frosted globeHer hair had been flattened by her hat becomingly over the broad top of her headand its mass pushed down in a loose careless bundle with good chance curves reaching low on to her neckShe poured the hot water into one of the large cream coloured basinsher eye running round the broad gilt edged band ornamenting its rim over the gleaming marble cover of the washstandthe gleaming tiles facing her beyond the rim of the basin the highly polished woodwork above the tilesShe snuffed freshness everywhereWhile the fresh unscented curdiness of the familiar Broom soap went over her face and wrists and hands she began to hunger for the clean supperfor the fresh night in the freshness of the large square bedfor the clean solid leisurely breakfastPushing back her hair she sponged the day from her face sousing luxuriously in the large basin and listening to Grace moving slowly about upstairsSeizing a towel she ran up the little single flight and stood towelling inside Grace s doorHullo pink facelaughed Grace tenderlysmoothing tissue paper into a large hat box I say it The Little Review must be an enormous one It isit s huge smiled Grace You must show it to me tomorrow Miriam ran downstairs and back to the mirror in her room to look at her clean untroubled faceDon t run about the housecome down to suppercalled Florrie from belowHave they brought the sausagesasked MrsPhilps acidlyYesscowled FlorrieDon t forget to tell Christine how we like them donesaid Grace anxiously frowningMiriam took her eyes from the protruding eyes of the Shakespeare on the wall oppositeand shut away within her her sharp sense of theheavy things ranged below him on the mantlepiece behind Florriethe landscape on one side of himthe picture of Queen Victoria leaningon a walking stick between two Hindu servantsreceiving an addresson the other sidethe Satsuma vases and bowls on the sideboard behind MrsPhilpsthe little sharp bow of narrow curtain screened windows behind Gracethe clean gleam on everything Christine Oh yes didn t you knowShe s been with us a month What became of AmeliaOh we had to let her goShe got fat and lazyThey all dothey re all the same Go on MiriamWell said Miriam from the midst of her second helping they both listenedand the steps came shambling up their stairs and they heard the man collapse with a groan against their doorThey waited andwellall at once the manwellthey heard him being violently ill Oh Miriam Yeswasn t it awfuland then a feeble voice like a chant a a a ah oooo oo oo Komand hailpe mee voice Oh Meester BellKomohI am freezing to deathwhat a pity what a pity and then silenceShe fed rapidlyholding them silent and eager for her voice again to fill out the spaces of their room For about half an hour they heard him break outevery few minutesoh Meester Belldear pretty MrBell KomI am freezing to death whatta pitywhattapityThe Brooms sat breaking one against the other into fresh laughterMiriam ate rapidly glancing from face to faceWhat eh pitie what eh pitie she moanedCan t you hear himGrace choked and sneezed and drank a little milkThey were all still slowly and carefully eating The Little Reviewsaid MrsPhilps mopping her eyes and dimpling and sighing upon the end of her laughterI didn t come across himIt was at Mag s and Jan s boarding houseMrsPhilps had not begun to listen at the beginningBut Grace and Florrie saw the whole thing clearlyMrsPhilps did not remember who Mag and Jan wereShe would not unless one told her all about their circumstances and their parentsFlorrie s face was preparing a questionThen they must have went on MiriamThere was a subdued ring at the front door bellThere s Christine shall we have her in to change the plates auntfrowned Florrie No leter changer dressWe can put the plates on the sideboardThen they must have gone to sleep again said Miriam when Florrie returned from letting Christine in because they did not hear him go downstairs and he wasn t there in the morning A good thing I should thinkobserved MrsPhilpsHe wasn t there said Miriam cheerfully er not course appearing from the sideboard she greeted the blancmange and jam with a soft shoutfeeling as hungry as when supper had begunIsn t she rude chuckled Florrieputting down a plate of bananas and a small dish of chocolatesOoo ooo squealed Miriam Be quiet and behave yourself and begin on that said Grace giving her a plate of blancmangeOh yes and then said Miriam inspired to remember more of her storyit all came outHe musthave got down somehow to his room in the morningBut he lay on the floor he told them at dinner all of mee could not find thee bed at once Oh oh oh He had beenshe cried raising her voice above the tumult to a birthday partytwenty seex wheeskies and sodahsWhy did he talk like thatWas he an IrishmanOhcan t you hearHe was a HinduThey all talk like that I will kindly shut the door When they write letters they begin honoured and spanking sirwept Miriam they find spanking in the dictionary and their letters are like that all the way through masses of the most amazing adjectivesWhy did Mag and Jan leave that boarding houseasked Florrie into the midst of Miriam s absorption with the solid tears on MrsPhilps cheekbonesShe was longing for MrsPhilps to see the second thingnot only the funniness of spanking addressed to a civil servantbut exactly how spanking would look to a HinduIf only they could see those things as well as produce their heavenly kughsOhI don t knowshe said wearilyyou see they never meant to go thereThey wanted a place of their ownIf room enclosed her even more happily with Christine thereeverything looked even more itself we stayed awake till what seemed almost morningalways till long after the ser mour domestic staff had gone to bedTheir rooms were on the same floor as the night nursery Christine was padding out with a trayher back to the roomshe had a holiday every year and regular off times and plenty of money to buy clothes and presentsprobably she had some sort of homeWhen she had taken away the last of the supper things and closed the door Grace patted the arm of the vacant armchairI like this bestsaid Miriam drawing up a little carved wooden stooloh don t sit on that cried MrsPhilps I m all right only they could realise Mag and JanThere was never enough time and strength to make everything clearAt every turn there was something they saw differentlyThey are a pair she breathed sleepilyNothanksshe answered formally to an offer of more blancmangeShe was beginning to feel strong and sleepyNo thanks she repeated formally as the heavy dish of bananas came her wayShe wants a chocolate said Florrie from across the tableMiriam revived a littleTake two begged MrsPhilpsThey re so hugesaid Miriam obeying and leaving the chocolates on her plate while her mind moved heavily about seeking a topicThey were all beginning on bananasIt would be endlessBy the time it came to sitting over the fire she would be almost asleepShe stirred uneasilySomeone must be seeing her longing and impatience3 Miriam lost threads while Christine cleared away supper Brooms watched her undisturbedfrom their places by the firenow and again addressing intructions in low frowning voices from the midst of conversation Do sit down said MrsPhilps ather toes I think we did half believe it she pursued with biting heartinessaching with the onset of questionsspeaking to make warmth and distraction for ChristineShe had never thought about itHad they half believed itHad anyone ever put it to them in so many wordsGiving an opinion opened so many thingsIt was impossible to show everythingthe more opinions you expressed the more you misled people and the further you got away from them Because she continued with a singing animationChristine pondering intervals glanced 8 The Little Review said Miriam hurriedlylooking at no one and drawing herself briskly upright with her eyes on the clear blazeGrace and Florrie were close on either side of her in straight chairsleaning forward towards the fireMrsPhilps sat back in the smaller of thechest crouchedher head bent and propped on her hand half facing their close row and gazing into the fireThere was a silenceFlorrie cleared her throat and glanced at MiriamMiriam half turned with weary resentmentDid you used to hang up staring at the fireFlorrie patiently cleared her throatWith weary animation Miriam dropped phrases about the parcels that were too big for the stockingthe feeling of them against one s feet when one moved in the morningShy watchful glances came to her from FlorrieGrace took her hand and made encouraging sympathetic soundsHow secure they weresitting with all the hoiday ahead over the fire which would be lit again for them in the morningThis was only the fag end of the first evening and it was beginning to be like the beginning of a new dayThings were coming to her out of the firefresh and newseen for the first timea flood of imagesShe contemplated them with eyes suddenly cool and sleeplessrelaxing her stiff attitude and smiling Vaguely at the fire ironsShe s tiredshe wants to go to bed said MrsPhilps turning her headThe two heads came roundDo you my sweetasked Grace pressing her handYou shall have breakfast in bed if you like Miriam grimaced briskly in her directionDid you have a Noah s ark she asked smiling at the fireYesFlorrie had oneUncle George gave it to herThey began describingDidn t you love itbroke in Miriam presentlyDo you remember and she recalled the Noah s ark as it had looked on the nursery floorthe wooden blankness of the rescued familythe look of the elephants and giraffes and the green and yellow grasshoppers and the red lady birdall standing about alive amongst the little stiff bright green trees We had a farm yard toopigsand ducks and geese and hens with feathers We used to stand them all out together on the floorand the grocer s shop and all our dolls sitting round against the nursery wallIt used to make me perfectly happyIt would still Everyone laughed It wouldIt does only to think of itAnd there was a doll s house with a door that opened and a staircase and furniture in the roomsI can smell the smell of the inside at this momentBut the thing I liked best and never got The Little Review accustomed to was a little alabaster church with coloured glass windows and a place inside for a candleWe used to put that out on the floor tooI wish I had it nowThe kaleidoscopeDo you remember looking at the KaleidoscopeI used to cry about it sometimes at nightthinking of the patterns I had not seenI thought there was a new pattern every time you shook itforeverWe had a huge one with very small bits of glassThey clicked smoothly when the pattern changed and were very beautifullyhave a little paper theatreThey were all looking at hernot at the little theatreShe wished she had not mentioned itIt was so sacred paper scraping over the little wooden rollers as the scenes came round backwards or forwardsShe plunged into descriptions of deep views of the insides of cathedrals in sharp relief in a clear silver lightmountainslakesstatuary in clear light out of doors and came back to the dollspressing alone wearily on through the dying interest of her hearers to discover with sleepy enthusiasm the wisdom and indifference and independence of Dutch dollsthe charm of their wooden bodiesthe reasons why one never wanted to put any clothes on themthe dear kind friendliness of dolls with composition headsI don t believe I ve ever loved anyone in the world as I loved Daisy YesI know we had one tooit belongedtrunk for its clothes and felt huge and solid when you carried itbut it was as far away from you as a human being yesthe rag dolls were simply funny I never understand all that talk about the affection for rag dollsWe used to scream at ours and hold them by the skirts and see which could bang their heads hardest against the wallThey were always like a Punch and Judy showThe composition dolls I mean were painted a soft colourvery roundly moulded headswith a shapejust a little hairindicated with an expressionlooking at somethinglooking at the same thing you looked at yourselfMrsPhilps yawned and Florrie began making a move I suppose it s bed time said MiriamThey were all looking sleepyHave a glass of claret Miriam before you go said MrsPhilpsNo thank yousaid Miriam springing up and dancing about the roomGiddy girlchuckled MrsPhilps affectionatelyGrace and Florrie fetched dust sheets 10 The Little Review from the hall cupboard and began spreading them over the sofaits distances where a meadow stream that was wide in the fore ground with a stone bridge and a mill wheel and a cottage half hidden under huge treesgrew narrow and wound on and on through tiny distant fields until the scene melted in a soft toned mistheld all her early visits to the Brooms in the Banbury Park days before they had discovered that she did not like sitting with her back to the fireShe listened eagerly to the busy sounds of the BroomsSomeone had bolted the hall door and was scrooping a chair over the tiles to get up and put out the gasDust sheets were still being flountered in the room behind herGrace s arm came round her waistI m so glad you ve come sweet she said in her low steady shaken tones So m I said MiriamIsn t that a jolly picture YesIt s an awfully good one you knowIt was one of papa s What s O Hara doing in the kitchenTaking Grace by the waist Miriam drew into the passage trying to prance with her down the hallThe little kitchen was obscured by an enormous clothes horse draped with airing linenShe s left a miserable firesaid MrsPhilps from behind the clothes horse She hasn t done the saucepans aunt scolded Florrie from the scullery Never mindwe can t have er down nowIt s neely midnight4 Miriam emerged smoothly into the darkness and lay radiantThere was nothing but the cool sense of life pouring in from some inner source and the deep fresh spaces of the darkness all round herPerhaps she had awakened because of her happinessclear gentle and soft in a melancholy minor key a little thread of melody sounded from far away in the night straight into her heartThere was nothing between her and the sound that had called her so gently up from her deep sleepShe held in her joy to listenThere was no sadness in the curious sorrowful little airIt drew her out into the quiet neighbourhood misty darkness along empty roadsplaques of lamplight here and there on pavements and across house fronts blackness in large gardens and over the bridge and in the gardens at the backs of the rows of little silent dark housesa pale lambency over the canal and reservoirsSomewhere amongst the little roads a group of players hooting gently and carefully slow sweet notes as if to wake no oneplaying to no oneout into the darknessBack out of fresh darkness came the sweet clear The Little Review 11 music the waitsof courseShe rushed upup and out heart foremostHer love flowed into every turn of the well known house and hovered near each sleeping formflowed into the recesses of their livesflowed on swiftly across a tide of remembered and forgotten sent her forward to tomorrow sitting her upright in morning light telling her with shouts that the day was there and she had only to get up into itthe little air had paused on a tuneful chord and ceased It was beginning again nearer and clearerShe heard it carefully throughIt was so strangeIt came from far back amongst the generations where everything was differenttelling you that they were the same In the way those people were playingin the way they made the tune sound in the air neither instrument louder than the others there was something that knewSomething that everybody knowsThey show it by the way they do thingsno matter what they say Her heart glowed and she stirredHow rested she wasHow fresh the air wasWhat freshness came from everything in the roomShe stared into the velvety blackness trying to see the furnitureIt was the thick close drawn curtains that made the perfect velvety darkness Behind the curtains and the Venetian blinds the windows were open at the top letting in the garden airThe little square of summer garden showed brilliantly in this darkest winter blacknessIt was more than worth while to be wakened in the middle of the night at the BroomsThe truth about life was in themShe imagined herself suddenly shouting in the nightAfter the first fright they would understand and would laughShe yawned sleepily towards an oncoming tangle of thoughtspushing them off and slipping back into unconsciousnessMiriam picked up the blouse by its shoulders and danced it up and down in time to the girlsvolley of affectionate raillery Did you sleep wellbroke in MrsPhilps sitting briskly up and superciliously grasping the handle of the large coffee pot with her small shrivelled handChristmas Day had begunThe time for trying to say suitable things about the present was overAll the six small hands were labouring amongst the large things on the tableThe blouse hung reala blousea glorious superfluity in her only just sufficient wardrobeYesthank youI did she said ardentlylowering it to her kneesTherich strong coffee was flowing The Little Review of rashers and Florrie would have finished extracting the eggs from the boilerShe laid the blouse carefully on the sofa and heard in among the table sounds the greetings that had followed her arrival downstairsThe brown and green landscape caught her eyeold and stillholding all her knowledge of the Brooms back and backfresh with another visit to themShe turned back to the table witha sighSomeone chuckledPerhaps at something that was happening on the tableShe glanced aboutThe fragrant laughed Florrie drawing the mustard pot from the cruet stand and rapping it down before herThere was something that she had forgottensome point that was being missedsomething that must be said at this moment to pin down the happiness of going away Mustard said Florrie tapping the table with the mustard potsDid you hear the waitsasked MrsPhilps with dreary acidityThat was itShe turned eagerlyMrsPhilps was sipping her coffeeMiriam waited politely with the mustard pot in her hand until she had put down her cup and then said anxiouslyoffering it to MrsPhilps they played Help yourselflaughed MrsPhilps a most lovely curious old fashioned thing she went on anxiouslyFlorrie was watching her narrowlyThat was The Mistletoe Bough bridled MrsPhilps accepting the mustardOh that s The Mistletoe Bough mused Miriam thrillingThen MrsPhilps had heardand felt the same in the nightNothing was missingEverything that had happened since she has arrived on the doorstep came freshly back and on into to dayflowing over the embarrassment of the parcelsThere was nothing to sayno words that could express ita tune That s the Mistletoe Boughshe said reflectivelyFlorrie was sitting very upright exactly oppostivequietly on her plateGrace s small hands and mouth were gravely labouringShe began swiftly on her own meallistening for the tune with an intelligent faceIf Florrie would take off her attention she could let her face become a blank and recover the tuneImpossible to go on until she had recalled itShe sought for some distracting remakrGrace spokeFlorrie turned towards herMiriam radiated agreement and sipped her hot coffeeIts strong aroma flowed through her sensesShe laughed sociablySomeone else laughedOf course they don t said Florrie in her most grinding voice and laughedTwo voices broke out togetherMirThe Little Review 13 iam listened to the tonesglancing intelligence accordinglyumpiringthere was a silnceMrsPhilps had bridled and said something decisiveMiriam guiltily re read the remarkShe could not think of anything that could be made to follow it with any show of sinceritygrown dark and oldMiriam glanced restively at her meaning Large terrible illnesses the doctor comingtrouble amongstfamiliesshylyMiriam looked acrossShe looked very younga child speaking on sufferancesaying the first thing that occurs lest someone rushed to Miriam s mindThey would have re awakened the laughter and talkbut there would have been resentment in the widowed figure at the head of the tablethe figure that had walked with arch dignity into the big north London shop and chosen the blouseThe weight in the air was dreadful There don t seem to be snowy Christmases nowadays she said turning deferentially to her hostess with her eyes on Florrie s child s eyes Christmas is a very different thing to what it was breathed MrsPhilps sitting back with folded hands from her finished mealOhI don t know aunt corrected Grace anxiously aren t you going to have your toast and marmaladeYou lived in the North all your young ChristmasesIt s always colder thereTake some toast aunt We used to burn Yule logs flickered MrsPhilpsplaintively refusing the toastMiriam waited imagining the snow on the garden where the frilled shirts used to hang out to bleach in the dew the great floodthe anxiety in the big houses Yule logs would look funny in this gratelaughed Florrie OhI don t knowpressed GraceWe had some last yearHaven t we got any this year aunt I ordered some woodI don t know if it s come Miriam could not imagine the Brooms with burning logsYesshe couldThey were nearer to burning logs than anyonelogs in the Christmas numbersThe glow would shine on to their faces and they would see into the pastBut it was all in the pastYule logs and thenno yule logsEveryone even the Brooms were being pushed forward into a new cold worldThere was no time to remember they don t build grates for wood nowadaysruled MrsPhilpsWho could stop all this coming and crowding of mean little thingsBut the wide untroubled leisure of the Brooms 14 The Little Review breakfast table was shut away from the mean little things Are you coming to church MiriamMiriam looked across the doomed breakfast table and met the watchful eyesBehind Florrie very upright in her goodonce best stuff dresstwo years old in its features and methodically arrived at morning wearthe fire still blazed its extravagant welcomethe first of Christmas morning was still in the roomWhen they had all busied themselves and goneit would be goneShe glanced about to see that everyone had finished and put her elbows on the tableWell she said abundantlyThere was an expectant relaxing of attitudes I should like to go very muchBut Grace fidgetting her brooch had flung her unrestrained burning affectionate glance when I saw MrLa Trobe climbing into the pulpit Florries eyes were downcast and MrsPhilps was blowing her nose her eyes gazing wanly out above her handkerchief towards the little curtained bow window Miriam dimpled and glanced sideways at Grace one loud shriek the three laughters broke forth together and fall gasping to the ground Then you d certainly better not go chuckled Florrie amidst the general wiping away of tears I saw the Miss Pernes at Strudwick s on FridayMiss Perne and Miss Jenny ohdid youreponded Miriam hurriedlyThe room lost something of its completenessThere was a coming and a goingthe pressing grey of an outside world How are theyThey seemed very well They don t seem to change OhI m so glad They asked for you Oh I didn t say we were expecting you Ohit s such an age We always say you re very busy and hard worked smiled Grace Yesthat s itYou didn t go often even when Miss Haddie was alive Noshe was awfully goodshe used to come down and see me in the west end when I first came to townHow they like the west end AuntI don t blame themShe used to write to you a lot didn t she MiriamShe used to come and talk to me in a tea shop at six fifteenyes she wrote regularly said Miriam irritably You were awfully fond of Miss Haddie weren t youMiriam peerd into space struggling with a tangle of imagesHer mind leapt from incident to incident weaving all into a generalto her pained consciousness that nothing she saw and felt wascontradictoryup and down backwards and forwardsall true The The Little Review 15 things they would grasp here and there would misrepresent herself and the whole pictureWhy would people insist upon talking about things when nothing can ever be communicated She felt angrily about in the expectant stillnessShe could see their minds so clearlywhy wouldn t they just look and see hers instead of waiting for some impossible pronouncementYes would be a lieNo would be a lieAny statement would be a lieAll statements are liesI like the Pernes better than I like youI like all of you better than the PernesI hate youI hate the PernesIof course you must know ithate everybodyI adore the Pernes so much that I can t go and see themBut you come and see usYesbut you insistThen you like us only as well as you like the Pernesyou like all sorts of people as well perhaps better than you like usI have nothing to do with anyoneYou shall not group me anywhereI am everywhereLet the day go onDon t sit there worrying me to death They always send you their love and say you are to go and see them Oh yesI must gosome time They are wonderfully fond of their girlsIt s one of the greatest pleasures of their lives keeping up with the old girls Fatigue was returning upon Miriamher face flushed and her hands were large and coldShe drew them down on to her unowned kneesA mild yes would bring the sitting to an endBut you see I m not an old girl she said impatientlyNo one spokeFlorrie s mind was darkly moving towards the things of the dayPerhaps MrsPhilps and Florrie had been thinking of them for some minutesYou know it does make a difference she pursuedobsequiously collecting attentionwhen people are your employersYou can never feel the same Everyone hoveredand MrsPhilps smiled in triumphant curiosityI shouldn t have thought it made any difference to you Miriam said Florrie flushing heavilyI think I know what Miriam means said Grace gently radiating I always feel a pupil with them much as I like them Graced you know you re my pupil said Miriam leaping out into laughterI can see Grace she drove on carrying them all with herignoring the swift eyes upon the dim things settling heavily down upon her heart gazing out of the window in the little room where I was supposed to be holding a German class Yes I know Miriam darlingbut now you kriow me you know I could never be any good at languages You re my pupil It seems absurd to think of you as a teacher now we know you chuckled FlorrieAren t you glad it s overMiriam 16 The Little Review MiriamI loved the teachingI ve never left off longing to go back to school myself yawned Miriam absentlyYou won t get much sympathy out of Florrie I was a perfect fool beamed FlorrieEveryone laughedI often think now chuckled Florrie rosy and tearful when I open the front door to go out how glad I am there s no more school Miriam looked across laughing affectionatelyWhy did you like your school so much MiriamI didn t like it except now and again terrifically in flashesI didn t know what it wasI hadn t seen other schoolsI didn t know what we were doing It wasn t a a genteel school for young ladiesthere was nothing of that in it You never know when you re happy reproved MrsPhilps OhI don t know auntI think you do appealed Graceher eyes full of shy championshipI m very happythank youaren t we all happy dear brethernchirped Miriam towards the cruet standSilly children Now aunt you know you areYou know you enjoy life tremendouslyOf course I do cried MrsPhilps beaming and bridlingIn a devout low tone she added it s the little simple things that make you happythe things that happen every day For a moment there was nothing but the sound of the fire flickering in the beamy airHadn t we better have her in auntmuttered GraceFlorrie got up briskly and rang the bell6 They all went busily upstairsEven Grace did not lingerLet me come and help make my bed said Miriam going with her to the door Noyou re to rest I don t want to rest Then you can run round the room She turned back towards the silent disarrayBusy sounds came from upstairsA hurried low reproving voice emerged on to the landingand light the drawing room fire as soon as you ve finished clearing and when the postman comes leave the letters in the boxChristine came Moving away from the attraction of the blouse Miriam wandered to the firesideHer eyes turned towards the chair in the comer half hidden by the large armchairThere they wereon the top of the pile of newspapers and magazinesDare s Annual lay look at them now would be to anticipate the afternoonBut there would be at least two Windsors that she had not seenShe drew one out and stood turning over the leavesIt would be impossible The Little Review 17to look round and say a Happy Christmas and then go on readingand just as bad to stop reading and not say anything moreShe planted herself in the middle of the hearthrug with her face to the roomWhy should she stand advantageously there while Christine unwillingly labouredWhy should Christine Christine was still making noises in the kitchenThere was time to escapeThe drawing room door would be bolted and that meant getting one of the hall chairs and telling the whole house of an extraordinary impulseUpstairs her bed would still be being made or her room dustedShe drew up the little stool and sat dejectedlyclose over the fire as if with a heavy cold in her head and anxiously deep in the pages of the magazinePerhaps Christine would think she did not hear her come inshe guessed the story from the illustrations and dropped into the text half way through the narrative No woman who did typewriting from morn ing till night and lived in a poor lodging could look like thatperhaps some didperhaps that was how clerks ought to look she skimmed onmoving automatically to make room for boots that were being put down in the fenderready to speak in a to the tableIt was ChristineIf she blew her nose and coughed Christine would know she knew she was thereShe turned a page swiftly and wrapped herself deeply in the nextWhen Christine had gone away with a trayful she resumed her place on the hearthrugcatch her eye and say Good morningI wish you a happy ChristmasChristin for the eyes to lifther lips powerlessIt was too late to say good morningSadness grew for her in the roomHer thoughts washed homelessly to and fro between her various world and the lumpy figure moving sullenly along the edge of an unknown lifeStepping observantly in through the half open door with a duster bunched carefully in her hand came FlorrieMiriam flung out a greeting that swept round Christine and cut into a shining worldIt brought Florrie to her side in shy delightChristine taking her final departure meeting the brown expressionless glitter of Christine s eyesHullo O Hara she defendedcollecting herself for the challenge 18 The Little Review that would follow Florrie s encirclement of her waist Hullo Little

holding hersmiling her anxious pleading solicitous smileI tell you never berrer repeated MiriamDear sweet pink face smiled Grace and turned carefully away to her dustingMiriam sank into an armchairhighly polished surfaces Wellshe asked presently how are things in generalGrace rose from her knees and carefully shut the doorShe came back with fear darkening the velvety lustre of her eyes Oh I don t know Miriam dear she murmured her hands out towards the fireIt s all over thought Miriamfaintly angeredI ve got ever so many things to tell youI want to ask your advice Remember I ve never even seen him said Miriam automaticallyfiguring the surroundedness the sudden realization and fearthe recapturing of libertythe sudden evasive determined retreatOhbut you always understandWait till we can talk she sighed rising from her kneesand kissing Miriam s foreheadIt was all overGrace was clinging to somereasonableexplanation of some final thingShe cast about in hermind for something from her own scattered circumstances to feed their talk when it should comeShe would have to induce Grace to turn away and go onthe end of the long history of faithfully remembered details would be a reliefthe delicate depths of their intercourse would come backits reach backwards and forwardsand yet without anything in the backgroundit seemed as if always something were needed in the background to give the full glow to every day she must be made to The Little Review 19 see the real face of the circumstance and then to know and to feel that she was not forlornthat the glow was there first to brush away the delusion ruthlesslyandthen let the glow come backbegin to come backfrom another source7Left alone with silence all along the streetChristine inaudible in the kitchendead silence in the houseMiriam gathered up her blouse and ran upstairsAs she passed through the changing lights of the passageup the little dark staircase past the turn that led to the little lavatory and little bathroom and was bright in the light of a small uncurtained latticeon up the four stairs that brought her to the landing where the opposing bedroom doors flooded their light along the strip of green carpet between the polished balustrade and the high polished glass doored bookcasethe years tumbled about herCrowding incidents set in vast backgrounds streamed in through her consciousness blotting out the daywashing away from future and past all but joyInside her room tidied until nothing was visible but the permanent shining gleaming furniture and ornamentsonly the large box of matches on the corner of the mantelpiece betraying the movements of separate daystelling her of nights of arrivalthe lighting of the gasthe sudden light in the frosted globe preluding freedom and restbringing theall the pastall her years of work set in the airframed and contemplable like the pictures on the walland beside them the early golden years in snatcheschosen pictures from here and there communicated and stored in the loyal memory of the BroomsLeaping in among these live days came to day the blouse belonged communicated to the year that was waiting far offinvisible behind the high wall of ChristmasShe dropped it on the bed and ran downstairs to the little drawing roomThe fire had not yet conquered the mustiness of the airThe room was full of strange dim lights coming in through the stained glass door of the little greenhouseShe pushed open the glass door turning the light to a soft green and sat sociably down in a low chair her hands clasped upon her kneestopics racing through her mind in a voice thrilling with stored up laughterIn her ears was the rush of spring rain on the garden foliageand presently a voice saying where are we going this summerBy the time they came back she would be too happy to speakBetter perhaps to go out into the maze of little streets 20 The Little Review and in wearying of them foe glad to come backAs she moved to the door she saw the garden in late summer fulnessthe holidays overtheir heights gleaming through long talks on the seat at the end of the gardentheanswering glow of the great blossoms of purple clematis hiding the north London masonry of the little down rich with happenings to where the high wall of Christmas again rose and shut out the futureShe ran busily upstairs casting away sight and hearing and hurried thoughtlessly into her outdoor things and out into the streetShe wandered along the little roads turning and turning until she came to a broad open thoroughfare railed in gardensTrams jingled up and down the centre of the road bearing the names of unfamiliar parts of LondonPeople were standing about on the terminal islands and getting in and out of the tramsShe had come too farHere was the wildernessthe undissembling soul of north Londonits harsh unvarying all embracing walks with the school girls or in lonely wanderingsthe unveiled motives and feelings of people she had passed in the streetsthe expression of noses and shouldersthe indefinable uniformityof bearing and purpose and visioncrowded in on heroppressing and darkening the crisp light airShe fought against themrallying to the sense of the dayIt was Christmas Day for them allThey were keeping Christmas in their homescarrying it out into the streetsgoing about with parcelsgreeting each other in their harsh ironic voicesLong ago she had passed out of their world for evercarrying it forwarda wound in her consciousness unhealedbut powerless to re inflict itselfpowerless to spread into her lifeThey and their world wer e still thereunchangedBut they could never touch her againensconced in her wealthIt did not matter now that they went their way just in the way they went their wayTo hate them for past suffering now that they were banished and powerless was to allow them to spoil her dayThey were even a possessiona curious thing apartunknown to anyone in her London lifedear north LondonersShe paused a momentlooking boldly across at the figures moving on the islandsAfter all they did not know that it was cold and desolate and harsh and dreadful to be going about on Christmas Day in a place that looked as this place looked in tramsThey did not know what was wrong with their clothes and their bearing and their way of looking at thingsThat was what was so terrible thoughWhat The Little Review 21 could teach themThere were so manyThey lived and died in amongst each otherWhat could change themHer facefelt drawn and weariness was coming upon her limbsa group was approaching her along the wide pavementlaughing and talkinga blatter of animated

pavement enamel washed clean by yesterday s rainShe hurried along feeling at her unsunned by the sunlightrootless sapless surfaces set in repellent clayspread out in meaningless airTo and fro her eyes slid upon the varnished leavesshe saw them in a park set in amongst massed dark evergreensgleaming out through afternoon mistkeeping the last of the light as the people drifted away leavingdrifted

through a white stone pillared balustradeThey appeared coming suddenly with the light of a street lampclumped safely behind the railings of a Bloomsbury squarethe opening of a side street led her back into the maze of little The Little Review roadsThe protective presence of the little house was there and she sauntered happily along through channels of sheltered sunlit silence What was she doing

known to those who sat round themThey looked out from that lifeseeing hers as hardship and gloompitying herturning blind eyes themShe saw herself relinquishing effortsputting on a desperate

counted themselves offThose were the facts as almost anyone might see themThey made those facts livethey tugged at the jungle of feelings that had the power to lead one back through any small crushing maiming aperture In their midst lived the past and the thing that had ended it and plunged it into a darkness that still held the threat of destroying reason and lifePerhaps only thus could it be

wanting that Vorticism is deadwe have him writing about itWe know MrPound s predilection for the deadThe deadhaving the all the while he has been digging his own literary graveWhen a man persistently denies lifelife will end by completely denying himThere is MrPoundfor whom the five yearsdead that the great war should have passed by and over him and left him contemplating the year 1919 with the same eyes that he contemplated the early part of 1914Does he think that byblastinghe can reerect the fallen walls of his Vorticistic JerichoThe Little Review 47 If art were merely an intellectual formulaas MrPound would have us believethis phenomenon would be understandableBut art also has its relation to the timeand is bound up irrevocably with the social processes of the momentwhether the individual instance be one of action or reactionThis is true of nations as well as of individualsAfter 1870 the French produced a great artthe Germans almost ceased producingGreat wars usually kill something articles writtenabout two years agowhy the war was bound to kill the sister arts of Vorticism and FuturismI will restate the case brieflyIn the first placebecause they were primarily prewar

etc and you have Marinetti sglory of warandcontempt of women etcHaving been translated into lifebeing after all no more than an integral part of the social processes which produced on the one hand Prussianismthe Vortex that failed on the otherBolshevismwhich is all for scatteredness and dispersion Vorticisman off shoot of Cubismand Futurism have lost their raison d etreThere is no liking war when you have seen itthere is no liking Bolshevism when you have seen itIt was still early in the war that the Rusian Futurist Mayakovskywith an intellectual honestywhich I commend to MrPoundin referring to the pre war art asdiabolic intuitionincarnated in the stormy today declared that Futurism was dead because it had become fully realized in lifeAgainthe Russian Futuristsafter Bolshevism had come into powersubscribed as a body to the new regimeproclaiming that it had realized their doctrinesThis at any rate is honestif uncouthI would like to correct MrPound on certain small detailsHe prouldy asserts that the government has had to apply to the Vorticist for a successful camouflageThat is quiet naturalVorticism is preeminently a camouflage artAgainMrPound asserts that the

does not tell us is that both MrLewis and MrRobertsas far as their work for the government is concernedhave compromised with their artIn their picturespainted for the Canadian War Museum and exhibited recently at the Royal Academythey have returned to realistic representation to such a degree thatthe elderlyhave indeed every justification for comparing their work to Lucca SignorelliIt is quite true thatVorticism has not yet had its funeral The poor dear has died on the batlefieldand no one even knows where its decayed remains areIf there is to be a funeral it shall have to be over an effigywhich MrPound is very busy putting togetherAs for dear Gaudier Brzeskawho was a great sculptor and a great manI do not intend to disturb his poor honest bones by say that Gaudier found in me a friend and appreciator long before MrPound had even heard of himor had thought of writing his miserable opinionswhich he has the arrogance to call art criticismLondonApril 1919 I am too much at war with the

Locareina de EspanaNotesThese notes have been detached from existing improvisations for their explanatory value 61By the brokenness of his composition the poet makes himself in no other wayThe speed of the emotions is sometimes such that thrashing about in a thin exaltation or despair many matters are touched but not heldmore often broken by the contact45The instability of these Improvisations would seem such that they must inevitably crumble under the attention and become particles of a wind that faltersIt would appear to the unready that the fiber of the thing is a thin jellyIt would be these same fools who would deny tough cords to the wind because they cannot split a storm endwise and wrap it upon spoolsThe virtue of strength lies not in the grossness of the fiber but In the fiber itselfThus a poem is tough by no quality it borrows from a logical recital of events nor from the events themselves but solely from that attenuated giving themthus a full being15It is seldom that anything but the most elementary communications can be reality only two or three reasons generally accepted as the causes Jof actionNo matter what the motive it will seldom happen that true knowledge of it will be anything more than vaguely divined by some one personsome half a person whose intimacy has perhaps been cultivated over the whole of a lifetimeWe live in bagsThis is due to the gross fiber of all actionBy action itself almost nothing can be impartedThe world of action is a world of stones39BlaBlaBlaHeavy talk is talk that waits upon a deedTalk is servile that is set to informWords with the bloom on them run before the imagination like the saeter girls before The Little Review Peer GyntIt is talk with the patina of whim upon it makes action a bootlickerSo nowadays poets spit upon rhyme and rhetoric95The stream of things having composed itself into wiry strands that move in one fixed directionthe poet in desperation turns at right angles and cuts across current wth startling results to his hangdog mood40In Francethe country of Rabelaisthey know that the world is not made up entirely of virginsThey do not deny virtue to the rest because of thatEach age has its perfections but the praise differsIt is only stupid when the praise of the gross and the transformed would be minted in unfit terms such as suit nothing but youth s sweetness and frailtyIt is necessary to know that laughter is the reverse of aspirationSo they laugh well in Franceat Coquelin and the PetomanTheir girlsalsothrive upon the love making they getso much so that the world runs to Paris for that reason41It is chuckleheaded to desire a way through every lose his taste for trufflesBecause snails are slimy when alive and because slime lis associatederroneouslywith filth the fool is fried in butter with chopped parsely upon themthey are deliciousThis is both sides of the questionthe slave and the despoiled of his senses are oneBut to weigh a difficulty and to turn it aside without being wrecked upon a destructive solution bespeaks an imagination of force sufficient to transcend actionThe difficulty has thus been solved by ascent to a higher planeIt is energy of the imagination alone that cannot be laid aside51Rich as are the gifts of the imagination bitterness of world slose is not replaced therebyOn the contrary it is intensifiedof the imagination cannot even know the full of his injury77Those who permit their senses to be despoiled of the things under their noses by stories of all manner of things removed and unattainable are of frail imaginationIdiotsit

worthy ardor leading to great natural activitywhereas a flowery skinned virgin may and no doubt often does allow herself to fall into destructive habits of neglectTHE BEAUTIFUL NEGLECTED ARTS by Marsden Hartley Satire and Seriousness THERE are a number of artists I am thinking of who have proved themselves from the standpoint of serious appreciation to be among the sadly neglectedamong the creators of aesthetic delightsI have arranged them in a careless sequence to suit the need of varietyThey are as followsthe plumberthe wire walkerthe aerial trapezistthe bareback riderthe fan paniterthe broncho busterallied and neglected contributors to our vagarious existenceYou will I think agree with me thaithese are several types of perfect artists having something so conspicuously to say to us sayin the sense ofdo and it will be conceded both by the few adorers of these geniuses and by the artists themselvesthat they are among the wilfully neglected ones in the realm of aesthetic considerationThe audience which they can be sure of is conspicuously limitednotably in the case of the plumberThese ladies and gentlemen are confined so strictly to the few that understand a perfect piece of workand have learned to be satisfied in their respective instancesthat their fame rests in the minds and memories of those who have attempted the practice of their artstherefore understanding them 6o The Little Review bestI should like to take the initiative of widening the area of and gentlemenI shall begin at once with his highnessLord of the nervous system of one s ever so simple homeor luxurious apartmentIt is an exquisite melody the flame of the plumber s lamp creates for the earweary of the modern struggle for maniacal melting the ladles of lead that shall seal your comfort foreverYou want to sing ditties of praise for the goodness of this gentlemanfor the keen perception that rises from the overallsand the strong face mottled with grease and the condiments peculiar to the tradeWhen this gentleman smiles up out of the cavern of his occupationyou realize the extraordinary charm of a personality that takes its ecstasy out of the joyful commingling and harmonizing of lead pipesHe is an esthetic benefactorand you feel you want to say something to him such asthank you sirfor the many beautiful half hoursor hours it may be if you are so sensual in your bath for the perfect system you have conferred whereby we satiate the needs of our labours and some would have the impulse to want to hand him a tray of gardenias that have been brought for him from a greek shepherd on the corner of the Avenue of AmericaYou regard him in the light ofdonororpatron saintalong with the maker of porcelain tubs and the mirror makeras also with thatgentilhomme merveilleusethe maker of locks and keysthey who are so implicitly tender in every regard toward the privacy of the world s public confessionsLet us now turn to our next neglected beautyIt is the the ripples on a stream in springThere is but onenone other so brilliant as sheand so I shall tell her nameIt is Bird MillmanIf you have ever seen thispetite charmanteof the wireyou will have seen what the swan and the cherryblossom would come to if unitedand you will have held to the moment passing before your eye like a pendant splendour before the gateway of the dawnYou are missing one of the reasons for existence if you have not watched the lovely lady of the frosted wireand you will regret forever the loss that is yours if you do not avail yourself of this so precious ten or twenty minutes she gives you which resolve themselves into a lifetime of miracled recollectionThe Little Review 61 Next we shall come to the pontifical MrBroncho BusterIf you have not seem him at the high mass of his soul of busting the fractious bronchoyou have sent another bliss to its grave without memoriamsHere is all that is lifelike in the art of throwing an obstreperous yourself alive the superb horseshoe shape of horseflesh writhing in determinationhis grace midairlegs rigid in stirrupsombrero tearing across a space of windchest out like the side of a battleship in actionwith guns pointed in the direction of the enemy and firing ferociously through the clouds that envelop them precisely as you see the half naked gunners through the smoke on the shivering deckIt is a battle of manflesh and horseflesh that is as forceful as a quadrille of the ball and the projectile off at seaThey tear the space around them with the velocity of two apache dancers from the old Montmartreand with the same frenzy that these would show youEnterinto the ring of the imaginationthe one perfect lady bareback rider of the worlddarlingest bit of energyand her name is May WirthAfter you have witnessed for five yearsonce a seasonthe incomparably lovely work of this little Australian girlyou wonder why there should be a drama of the sexes or the soulWhen she begins her performance adorably white and docile animal with the long flowing tailthen rises with a swoop to his kidneysand takes another two or three forward somersaults on the small of his backyou will be certain that she belongs You will say it is of a perfect piece with the marvellous and as yet unmatched death scene ofMelisande allowing naturally for the variance in the two themesIt is an operatic gesturing of the body this little lady with thelovely english accent gives youand you could wish for the rhythmists of time to assemble and take pointers for a new etudeThere is vigour of body and refinement of purpose combined in all these athletic artists which is to the common unperceptive is not conceivable in the case of the bareback rider for instance that ballet dancing should ever be an essential to this artand yet if you have the discerning eyeyou see instantly that both the men and women of the horse are possessed of exceptional talents for poise and grace of figure in the various attitudes that are a part of the picture when not in actual performanceIncidentally do not forget that MrChaplinapropos of acrobaticsis one of the greatest artists The Little Review of pantomime of this centuryif not the greatestand that his repetitive gratifying that so great an artist as MrsFiske paid enthusiastic tribute to this clownEven Gordon Craig might gain stimulus for his marionettes from the silent talking of this gentleman s bodyIt takes real artists to understand MrChaplinHe is an excellent anodyne for the ills of imagistsand I mean this most of all estheticallyPierrot the fan painter is with us who care for the most fragile of the painting artsIt is always agentlemanengaged in the the jaded sense from the fatigue that rises out of the round of of pleasureHis keenest excitement is the placing of shimmery You forget the fragrance of subways and the irritation that lurks in the politeness of busdrivers when you see one of these touches out of the eighteenth centurythese transcripts of Watteau such as Condor loved to evoke from his candle lit deliriumsI know of one who may be his successor at the fanHe is a tall and seemingly frailyet most tenacious young man who though he might seem to swim in the green pool of pornographic estheticsis a quiet country boy living on a calm islanddrinking nothing stronger than malted milk chocolateloving the domestic twitter of his white Java sparrowsand green parrokeetsconvolvulus Here we come to the ladies and gentlemen of the air that swing and sway like white peacocks among fig trees or smoky mimosa boughswhite mackerel of the high spaceslithing on a wave of like birds of paradisenow like nacreous morphos in a mossed jungle where orchids radiate a cool indifferenceClimbing the ropesthese ladies and gentlemen of the trapeze have an air of the palethe dark background of the tent is a pattern of muscular shot silkThey climb the illumined air as do white goats on a New Mexican hillsideand have the gaiety of young kids capering in and out of the sage where the darkeyed mexican chaperone watchesand herdsThey are as safe on their spaces as we are on our feetand trust it with more intelligenceknowing its possibilities and limitations better than we do our earthThey spin webs of body design as does the spider hurrying to catch the first dewand worship the lustre of them The Little Review 63 selves as they spinThey are a delectable crew of air sailors with beautiful bodies that know the danger of their seaand laugh at it with the beautiful body laughter of climbing wavesHere is the lonliest of the artistsand the most diffidenttherefore the happiest in that he wants no other audience than his own kindHe looks for no other salary than the salutation of his own pulse to the rhythm that invent themselves in himIt is the American dancerthe redman of the southwestHis only stardom in bright lights is the work of his finely attuned body in the clear sunlight of a clear dayand his only need for audience is that the men and women of his tribe shall feel and understand the essential harmonic of his and their forefathersmuscular playOne good hour of these geniuses and you will be willing to forego the conventional bacchic revelry of the greek vase foreverYou will dismiss all the Broadway semblances of grace and the worn notion of rhythmic movementfor he takes his place in your esteem along with the buck and wing splendoursand the fine performance of the adorable long thin boys of vaudeville with their eccentric clevernessYou would see the redman rise to the whirlwind intelligence of Vernon Castleand you could never look at the heavy imitations againIt finished for once and allthe deadest of dance expressionsthe Chopin Beethovenmisapplicationhappy to comprehendand comprehendingto emulateThe Diaghileffs of the world would expire with a single glimpse of this masterful gesturingAnd yet he is an unknown artistand by the time wethe invaders of his countryhave begun to glimpse him in merest outlinehe will have disappeared and like the greatest of comedians And then there are the tumblersjugglerswhole pyramids and monoliths of them that do their work while the jaded ones leave their seats for more drinks and eats and dancingOnce on a time one might have included aviators and chauffeurs among the exponents of the misunderstood artsBut with the mania of little girls of good familiesand grownup women with husbandsand the charming little boys are in nowise suffering from negelctThere is a mania among respectable girls for thesedarling thingsof the air which is positively tell you with almost

sublimely beautiful neglected artsIt will help change your psychologyand put themYou will love the tangle of wires and trapezeslead pipes and fansand bronchos in your brainYou will even let in the hordes of little huskies wanting a great though ephemeral career in the so popular pink journal of the barbershop and the clubrooms where bars and the punching bag are talking a new languageI expect when the aviators have had their day there will be a mania for lightweights wantingto meet all good boys at a hundred and twenty twoprefers Patsey this of Kid that etcThey have their popularity somewhatbut there is an indication that the roaming respectables of the Avenue of America will take up the newer type oflittle boy and we shall see society shifting its opera boxes to the ringsideBe
