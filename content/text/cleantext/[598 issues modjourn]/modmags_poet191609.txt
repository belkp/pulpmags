SEPTEMBER 1916  POEMS OLD AND NEW  THE FISH AND THE SHADOW  HE salmon trout drifts in the stream The soul of the salmon trout floats over the  stream Like a little wafer of light The salmon moves in the sun shot bright  shallow sea  As light as the shadow of the fish  that falls through the water She came into the large room by the stair Yawning a little she came with the sleep still upon her  I m just from bed The sleep is still in my eyes Come I have had a long dream  And I That wood And two springs have passed us   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Not so far no not so far now There is a place but no one else knows it A field in a valley   qu ieu sui avinen leu lo sai  She must speak of the time Of Arnaut de Mareuil I thought qu ieu sui avinen  Light as the shadow of the fish That falls through the pale green water  O ATTHIS  Thy soul Grown delicate with satieties Atthis  O Atthis I long for thy lips  I long for thy narrow breasts Thou restless ungathered  THE THREE POETS  Candidia has taken a new lover And three poets are gone into mourning The first has written a long elegy to Chloris To Chloris chaste and cold his only Chloris   The Three Poets  The second has written a sonnet upon the mutability of woman And the third writes an epigram to Candidia  PAGANAS  Suddenly discovering in the eyes of the very beautiful Normande cocotte The eyes of the very learned museum assistant  THE LAKE ISLE  O God O Venus O Mercury patron of thieves Give me in due time I beseech you a little tobacco shop With the little bright boxes  piled up neatly upon the shelves And the loose fragrant cavendish and the shag And the bright Virginia loose under the bright glass cases And a pair of scales  not too greasy And the volailles dropping in for a word or two in passing For a flip word and to tidy their hair a bit  O God O Venus O Mercury patron of thieves Lend me a little tobacco shop or install me in any profession Save this damn d profession of writing where one needs one s brains all the time   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  IMPRESSIONS OF FRANÇOIS MARIE AROUET DE VOLTAIRE  I Phyllidula and the spoils of Gouvernet  Where Lady are the days When you could go out in a hired hansom Without footmen and equipments And dine in a cheap restaurant  Phyllidula now with your powdered Swiss footman Clanking the door shut  and lying And carpets from Savonnier and from Persia And your new service at dinner And plates from Germain And cabinets and chests from Martin almost lacquer And your white vases from Japan And the lustre of diamonds  Etcetera etcetera and etcetera  II To Madame du Châtelet  If you d have me go on loving you Give me back the time of the thing  Will you give me dawn light at evening  Time has driven me out of the fine plaisaunces The parks with the swards all over dew And grass going glassy with the light on it The green stretches where love is and the grapes   Impressions of François Marie Arouet  Hang in yellow white and dark clusters ready for pressing And if now we can t fit with our time of life There is not much but its evil left us  Life gives us two minutes two seasons  One to be dull in Two deaths and to stop loving and being lovable That is the real death The other is little beside it  Crying after the follies gone by me Quiet talking is all that is left us Gentle talking not like the first talking less lively And to follow after friendship as they call it Weeping that we can follow naught else  III To Madame Lullin  You ll wonder that an old man of eighty Can go on writing you verses   Grass showing under the snow Birds singing late in the year  And Tibullus could say of his death in his Latin Delia I would look on you dying  And Delia herself fading out Forgetting even her beauty   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  HOMAGE TO QUINTUS SEPTIMIUS FLORENTIS CHRISTIANUS  Ex Libris Graecae  I Theodorus will be pleased at my death And someone else will be pleased at the death of Theodorus And yet every one speaks evil of death  Incerti Auctoris  II  This place is the Cyprian s for she has ever the fancy To be looking out across the bright sea Therefore the sailors are cheered and the waves Keep small with reverence  beholding her image  Anyte  III  A sad and great evil is the expectation of death And there are also the inane expenses of the funeral Let us therefore cease from pitying the dead For after death there comes no other calamity  Palladas IV Troy  Whither O city are your profits and your gilded shrines And your barbecues of great oxen And the tall women walking your streets in gilt clothes With their perfume in little alabaster boxes Where are the works of your home born sculptors   Homage to Quintus Septimius Florentis Christianus  Time s tooth is into the lot and war s and fate s too Envy has taken your all Save your douth and your story  Agathias Scholasticus  V  Woman Oh woman is a consummate rage but dead or asleep she pleases Take her she has two excellent seasons  Palladas  VI Nicharcus upon Phidon his doctor  Phidon neither purged me nor touched me But I remembered the name of his fever medicine and died  DANS UN OMNIBUS DE LONDRES  Les yeux d une morte aimée M ont salué Enchassés dans un visage stupide Dont tous les autres traits étaient banals Ils m ont salué  Et alors je vis bien des choses Au dedans de ma memoire Remuer S éveiller   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Je vis des canards sur le bord d un lac minuscule Auprès d un petit enfant gai bossu  Je vis les colonnes anciennes en toc Du Parc Monceau Et deux petites filles graciles Des patriciennes  aux toisons couleur de lin Et des pigeonnes Grasses  commes des poulardes  Je vis le parc Et tous les gazons divers Où nous avions loué des chaises Pour quatre sous  Je vis les cygnes noirs Japonais Leurs ailes Teintées de couleur sang de dragon Et toutes les fleurs D Armenonville  Les yeux d une morte M ont salué  Ezra Pound   EPIGRAMS  I will close my door to shut out all possible errors But how am I to enter in cried Truth  I obey not law I am free this is the boast of Dream Truth says sadly to him That is why thou art false Dream says Truth is bound in an endless chain of neces  sity Truth says That is why I am perfectly true  Favor complains I give but never receive Mercy says I give but never ask  Thou in the ditch hast an unlimited supply of mud But what has he who walks above thee  The wasp murmured in contempt How ludicrously small are the honeycombs the bees make Try to make a honeycomb still smaller said the bee  What costly preparations are for me says the canal rivers come rushing without ever being asked Sir Canal say his courtiers to him The poor rivers are made only to supply you with water  The First takes the hand of the Last in a frank friendship The Second keeps proudly aloof  The echo always mocks the sound to conceal that she is his debtor   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Love walks with empty hands and smiling face Prudence asks her What have you got for your wages Love says It is in my heart I can not show it Prudence says Whatever I get is in my hands  In the chink of the garden wall blossomed a tiny nameless flower The rosebush was ashamed to own it as its kindred The sun rose and smiled on it saying Are you well my darling  How far are you from me O fruit I am hidden in your heart O flower  Who is there to take up my duties asked the setting sun The world remained dark and silent With joined palms said the earthern lamp I will do what I can my master  What language is this of yours O deep sea It is the language of eternal question What language is this in which you answer O high moun  tain It is the language of eternal silence  The arrow thinks it is free for it moves and the bow is bound for it is still The bow says to the arrow Your freedom depends on me  The world speaks truth We take its meaning wrong and call it a liar   Epigrams  The infant flower opened its eyes and found the world sweet and it said to the world My love I hope you will last as long as I live  The flute knows it is the breath that gives birth to its music The breath knows it is nothing And he who plays on the flute is not known  The night comes secretly to open the buds in the forest and disappears in silence Flowers wake up and whisper We are of the morning The morning smiles and says Yes  Death threatens to take his son the thief his wealth and his detractors his reputation But who is there to take away my joy asks the poet  The night kisses the face of the fading day and gently says I am death your mother Do not fear me I am to give you fresh birth  Death belongs to life as birth does even as walking contains the raising of the foot as much as the laying of it down  Death hadst thou been but emptiness in a moment the world would have faded away Thou art Beauty the world like a child rests on thy bosom for ever and ever  Rabindranath Tagore   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  STRANGE MEETINGS  I  If one beheld a clod of earth arise And walk about and breathe and speak and love How one would tremble and in what surprise Gasp Can you move  So when I see men walk I always feel Earth How have you done this What can you be I m so bewildered that I can t conceal My incredulity  II  The dark space underneath is full of bones The surface full of bodies roving men And moving above the surface a foam of eyes Over that is Heaven All the gods Walk with cool feet They paddle among the eyes They scatter them like foam flakes on the wind Over the human world  III  You live there I live here Other people everywhere Haunt their houses and endure Days and deeds and furniture   Strange Meetings  Circumstances families And the stare of foreign eyes  IV  Often we must entertain Tolerantly if we can Ancestors returned again Trying to be modern man Gates of memory are wide All of them can shuffle in Join the family and once inside Oh what an interference they begin Creatures of another time and mood And yet they dare to wrangle and dictate Bawl their experience into brain and blood And claim to be identified with Fate  V  Eyes float along the surface trailing Obedient bodies lagging feet The wind of words is always wailing Where eyes and voices part and meet  VI  Oh how reluctantly some people learn To hold their bones together with what toil   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Breathe and are moved as though they would return How gladly and be crumbled into soil  They knock their groping bodies on the stones Blink at the light and startle at all sound With their white lips learn only a few moans  Then go back underground  VI I BIRTH  One night when I was in the House of Death A shrill voice penetrated root and stone And the whole earth was shaken under ground I woke and there was light above my head  Before I heard that shriek I had not known The region of Above from Underneath Alternate light and dark silence and sound Difference between the living and the dead  VIII  It is difficult to tell  Though we feel it well  How the surface of the land Budded into head and hand But it is a great surprise How it blossomed into eyes   Strange Meetings  IX  A flower is looking through the ground Blinking in the April weather Now a child has seen the flower Now they go and play together  Now it seems the flower would speak And would call the child its brother But oh strange forgetfulness They don t recognize each other  X  How did you enter that body Why are you here Your eyes had scarcely to appear Over the brim and you looked for me I am startled to find you How suddenly We were thrown to the surface and arrived Together in this unexpected place You who seem eternal lived You known without a word  XI  London is big I know is big So is the bee hive to the bee So is the dung heap to the cockroach And the flea flesh to the flea   London is great is great of course So is the ocean to the pool So is the halter to the horse So is folly to the fool  XII  I often stood by my open gate Watching the passing crowd with no surprise I had not ever used my eyes for hate Till they met your eyes  I don t believe this road was meant for you Or if it were I don t quite know what I am meant to do While your eyes stare  XIII  Memory opens memory closes Memory taught me to be a man  It remembers everything It helps the little birds to sing  It finds the honey for the bee It opens and closes opens and closes  Harold Monro   FIREFLIES  I  Children of the poor Little plants In sandy soil Among rocks weeds cans old papers And other junk In the shadow of a wall Little plants Children of the poor  II  From the gallery The orchestra A swarm of bees Making honey Honey made of Sound  III  Bud Needing opening Let me open you Fruit Needing ripening Let me ripen you  Adolf Wolff   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  OBSERVATIONS  CONVERSATION GALANTE  I observe Our sentimental friend the moon Or possibly fantastic I confess It may be Prester John s balloon Or an old battered lantern hung aloft To light poor travellers to their distress  She then How you digress  And I then Someone frames upon the keys That exquisite nocturne with which we explain The night and moonshine music which we seize To body forth our own vacuity  She then Does this refer to me Oh no it is I who am inane  You madam are the eternal humorist The eternal enemy of the absolute Giving our vagrant moods the slightest twist With your air indifferent and imperious At a stroke our mad poetics to confute  And Are we then so serious  LA FIGLIA CHE PIANGE  Stand on the highest pavement of the stair Lean on a garden urn Weave weave weave the sunlight in your hair   La Figlia che Piange  Clasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise Fling them to the ground and turn With a fugitive resentment in your eyes But weave weave the sunlight in your hair  So I would have had him leave So I would have had her stand and grieve So he would have left As the soul leaves the body torn and bruised As the mind deserts the body it has used I should find Some way incomparably light and deft Some way we both should understand Simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand  She turned away but with the autumn weather Compelled my imagination many days Many days and many hours Her hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers And I wonder how they should have been together I should have a lost a gesture and a pose Sometimes these cogitations still amaze The troubled midnight and the noon s repose  MR APOLLINAX  When Mr Apollinax visited the United States His laughter tinkled among the teacups I thought of Fragilion that shy figure among the birch trees   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And of Priapus in the shrubbery Gaping at the lady in the swing In the palace of Mrs Phlaccus at Professor Channing  Cheetah s His laughter was submarine and profound Like the old man of the sea s Hidden under coral islands Where worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the  green silence dropping from fingers of surf I looked for the head of Mr Apollinax rolling under a chair Or grinning over a screen With seaweed in its hair I heard the beat of centaurs hoofs over the hard turf As his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon He is a charming man But after all what did he mean His pointed ears he must be unbalanced There was something he said which I might have chal  lenged Of dowager Mrs Phlaccus and Professor and Mrs Cheetah I remember a slice of lemon and a bitten macaroon  MORNING AT THE WINDOW  They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens And along the trampled edges of the street I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids Hanging despondently at area gates   Morning at the Window  The brown waves of fog toss up to me  Twisted faces from the bottom of the street  And tear from a passerby with muddy skirts  An aimless smile that hovers in the air  And vanishes along the level of the roofs  T R Eliot  TO MY MOUNTAIN  O my mountain my mountain Enveloped in your cloak of snow Can you hear  Temple of my night Cradle of my day Can you hear  I warn you of the braggart of the sky The sun the sun He outruns my warning words To steal your snows O my mountain my mountain  Great body guard of God Can you hear  Mahdah Payson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  HOME  Is it a tribute or betrayal when Turning from all the sweet accustomed ways I leave your lips and eyes to seek you in Some other face  Why am I searching after what I have And going far to find the near at hand I do not know I only know I crave To find you at the end  I only know that Love has many a hearth That Hunger has an endless path to roam And Beauty is the dream that drives the earth And leads me home  Louis Untermeyer  RAVAGE  I did not dream one summer s rose Could blossom so luxuriantly I never knew one summer s close Could take so much away from me  John S Miller Jr   INVOCATION  As pools beneath stone arches take Darkly within their deeps again Shapes of the flowing stone and make Stories anew of passing men  So let the living thoughts that keep Morning and evening in their kind Eternal change in height and deep Be mirrored in my happy mind  Beat world upon this heart be loud Your marvel chanted in my blood Come forth O sun through cloud on cloud To shine upon my stubborn mood  Great hills that fold above the sea Ecstatic airs and sparkling skies Sing out your words to master me Make me immoderately wise  John Drinkwater   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  HE FORGETS YVONNE  Turning a sudden corner She reached the trysting place The gods grown weary of the sun Put twilight in her face  Dreams swift hopes rising falling Too soon too late too soon Were as a tide that rose and fell At the will of the moon  Around us was the star shine Like May in flowers clad Speaking she had the voice of brooks That made the meadows glad  She spoke of the great wonder That in her heart was laid And in her life had come to pass Ah need she be afraid  The moon with little vision Saw what was going on And by designing sorcery Made me forget Yvonne   He Forgets Yvonne  And lose her in this happy Inconsequential crowd Feeling in silence with Pierrette What Pierrot sings aloud  PIERRETTE GOES  Pierrette has gone but it was not Exactly that she died So much as vanished and forgot To say where she would hide  To keep a sudden rendezvous It came into her mind That she was late What could she do But leave distress behind  Afraid of being in disgrace And hurrying to dress She heard there was another place In need of loveliness  She went so softly and so soon Sh hardly made a stir But going took the stars and moon And sun away with her  William Griffith   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PRESENCES  A THRUSH IN THE MOONLIGHT  In came the moon and covered me with wonder Touched me and was near me and made me very still In came a rush of song raining as from thunder Pouring importunate on my window sill  I lowered my head I hid my head I would not see nor hear The bird song had stricken me had brought the moon too  near But when I dared to lift my head night began to fill With singing in the darkness And then the thrush grew  still And the moon came in and silence on my window sill  A MOCKING BIRD  An arrow feathery alive He darts and sings Then with a sudden skimming dive Of striped wings He finds a pine and debonair Makes with his mate All birds that ever rested there  Articulate  The whisper of a multitude Of happy wings   A Mocking bird  Is round him a returning brood Each time he sings Though heaven be not for them or him Yet he is wise And daily tiptoes on the rim Of paradise  TH E DEAD LOON  There is a dead loon in the camp tonight killed by a clever fool And down the lake a live loon calling The wind comes stealing tall muscular and cool From his plunge where stars are falling  The wind comes creeping stalking On its night hidden trail Up to the cabin where we sit playing cards and talking And only I of them all listen and grow pale  He glues his face to the window addressing only me Talks to me of death and bids me hark To the hollow scream of a loon and bids me see The face of a clever fool reflected in the dark  That loon is farther on the way than we are It has no voice with which to answer while we wait But it is with me and with the evening star Its voice is my voice and its fate my fate   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TO NO ONE IN PARTICULAR  Locate your love you lose your love Find her you look away Now mine I never quite discern But trace her every day  She has a thousand presences As surely seen and heard As birds that hide behind a leaf Or leaves that hide a bird  Single your love you lose your love You cloak her face with clay Now mine I never quite discern And never look away  AT THE TOUCH OF YOU  At the touch of you As if you were an archer with your swift hand at the bow The arrows of delight shot through my body  You were spring And I the edge of a cliff And a shining waterfall rushed over me  THE EARTH CLASP  Whether you fled from me not to have less Of love but to have all without a night   Too much like one who moves a cup which might Brim over with the mounting of excess Or whether you had felt in my caress The fingertips of surfeit and of blight Attempting love or whether your quick flight Was to another love I will not guess  I touch the pillow that has touched your head And the brief candle that has lighted you Sheds bleak and ashen light upon a face As absent as the moon till to replace Your vanished arms earth beckons me anew And in her clasp something of you is dead  HE BROUGHT US CLOVER LEAVES  He picked us clover leaves and starry grass And buttercups and chickweed One by one Smiling he brought them We can never pass A roadside or a hill under the sun Where his wee flowers will not return with him His little weeds and grasses cups that brim With sunbeams leaves grown tender in the dew  Come then oh come with us and each in turn Children and elders let us thread a few Of all the daisies to enfold his urn And fade beside this day through which he passes Bringing us clover leaves and starry grasses   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WISDOM  Old man if I only knew A quick way to be wise like you  Young man this is all I know To impart before I go You must keep your goal in sight Labor toward it day and night Then at last arriving there You shall be too old to care  You would even wiser be Old man were you young like me  ECCE HOMO  Behold the man alive in me Behold the man in you If there is God am I not he Shall I myself undo  I have been waiting long enough Old silent gods good by I wait no more The way is rough But the god who climbs is I  Witter Bynner  EDITORIAL COMMENT  JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY  DEAD my lords and gentlemen Stilled the tongue and stayed the pen Cheek unfiushed and eye unlit Done with life and glad of it  Curb your praises now as then Dead my lords and gentlemen What he wrought found its reward In the tolerance of the Lord  Low he lies yet high and great Looms he lying thus in state How exalted o er ye when Dead my lords and gentlemen  J W R  Riley was one of the poets of power in that it was given to him to tell the tale of the tribe He was keen enough in imagination fine enough in sympathy and creative enough in art to apprehend his fellow countryman and fix his type He arrived during his life at this high distinction that he speaks for Indiana and Indiana is what he made it Still more he has widened the bounds of Indiana made it absorb its middle western neighbors to right and left so far as their country people and village people are true to his type And be made the world love his Indiana his cheerful whimsical unassuming shrewd and sentimental neighbors the democratic people of the plains people strongly individualized and yet one not more than t other all measuring up to the same standard of extremely human feelings and failings He has given to a big state a personality in a sense his own person   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ality because he was of its essence By thus revealing its people to themselves he has given them power and pride a smiling pride as George Ade calls it in their own character and something of power to throw off the poses and pretences dear to every community and to live sincerely without fear or shame  It was humanity that interested him not nature One gets a general effect of plain fertile farming country as the background of his neighbors lives but he does not see details of land or sky Perhaps those large round glasses covered visual vagueness at any rate such a poem as Knee deep in June expresses a general human ecstasy in a beautiful day but it does not express that love of the earth and identification with its forces that intimate knowledge of every phase of earth life which we get for example from John Muir s prose and which we are beginning to feel in a few of the younger poets Riley s interest was in human beings yes and in dogs and other familiar animals  His art like the character of the people he spoke for was simple and direct If it yielded often to the temptation of a too obvious sentimentality it rose in strong moments to a poignant tenderness or even to a veiled suggestion of heroic beauty And always between both extremes it was iridescent with humor humor always gentle and tender never grim or grotesque or sardonic  He was of course to a degree unusual even among poets a child And out of a rare sympathy with fellow children he was able to produce masterpieces of child character like  Little Orphant Annie The Raggedy Man The Bear Story   James Whitcomb Riley  and other familiar ballads of eternal youth But beyond this  he was able to see grown ups almost with a child s direct  and untroubled vision and to sketch them vividly in a few  swift lines As Edith Wyatt wrote in the second number  of this magazine Nov 1912  Among Mr Riley s many distinguished faculties of execution in expressing in stimulating an exquisite appreciation of the most simple and universal relations of life one faculty has been in so far as I know very little mentioned I mean his mastery in creating character Mr Riley has expressed has incarnated in the melodies and harmonies of his poems not merely several living breathing human creatures as they are made by their destinies but a whole world of his own a vivid world of country roads and country town streets peopled with farmers and tramps and step mothers and children trailing clouds of glory even when they boast of the superiorities of Renselaer a world of hard working women and hard luck men and poverty and prosperity and drunkards and raccoons and dogs and grandmothers and lovers To have presented through the medium of rhythmic chronicle a world so sharply limned so funny so tragic so mean so noble seems to us in itself a striking achievement in the craft of verse  It is even more it is to be immortal Riley has captured a region and an era and so handled and molded and stamped it that he is inextricably bound up with it an ancestor of all who are born in it It is a smaller region than the one Mark Twain mapped out with epic grandeur and explored with abysmal laughter in a sense it is one of its neighborhoods Smaller also than Spoon River for it is all on the surface of the earth amid summer suns and storms while Spoon River digs deep to the earth s centre where all nations are neighbors It is a little world that Riley gives to us but a world very human and funny and brotherly and his best poems speak from the heart of it with its authentic lyric voice H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  OF EDITORS AND POETS  All young poets hate editors And they are right When a poet becomes tolerant of an editor or an editor of a poet it is not a healthy sign both have ceased to be alert  A wrathful young poet is the editor s best friend He may be overbearing insolent but he is apt to be honest The editor suggests cutting or changing his poem the poet flies into a rage and tells the editor what he thinks of him This induces a proper spirit of humility in the editor I am not speaking of editors who present to insult a front as smooth and impervious as a hair cloth sofa It also relieves the poet who when he has cooled off a bit wonders if his poem might not be improved according to the editor s suggestion or according to a new idea of his own Both therefore continue on a purely human footing of give and take healthily antagonistic and sociable  But the established poet whose reputation is not only made but embalmed and the editor who has no more plasticity than a hitching post there is no friction between them They are mutually tolerant of one another Why not The relation between them is simply that of a manufacturer and a retailer of any reasonably staple commodity like sugar or molasses or green cheese  Of course it takes skill to be a poet But an editor A pair of shears a blue pencil and a paste pot All the poet in me hates the editor The editor in me swears that I am a very bad poet the poet knows that the editor is a fool And neither one is entirely wrong A C H   REVIEWS THOMAS MACDONAGH AS CRITIC  Literature in Ireland Studies Irish and Anglo Irish by Thomas MacDonagh Talbot Press Dublin I have before me a very able and interesting book If  the tragic death of the author casts upon it any temporary accidental interest I would say only that this has in no way influenced my opinion  It is fine proof of Ireland s real vitality that at a time when we are so fully tired of Celticism when Celticism is so truly worn out we should meet in quick succession a great novelist like James Joyce and so level and subtle a critic as Thomas MacDonagh  The first part of his present book is taken up with what will seem to some a technical discussion of the Irish Mode of the effect of Irish idiom and cadence on English verse I indicated something of the sort when I pointed out that Mr Yeats cadence had been saved from the inanity prevalent among his English contemporaries by his having been brought up on The County of Mayo and such ballads MacDonagh has gone into the matter fully and carefully I do not know that many of his dicta will seem startling or heretical to the readers of POETRY of whom he seems to have been one One of the finest tributes to the magazine is that he should have chosen to quote from it at some length from an essay by A C H who is probably the best critic now writing in America But the more books we have   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  saying these same intelligent things the better and the sooner will we get rid of the papier maché tradition which has been a curse on both sides of the Atlantic for so many decades the heritage of what MacDonagh calls the genteel days This genteelness is much more active and oppressive than anyone not actually engaged in the production of literature is likely to be aware of and I have never yet met a layman who could not be made to sit up by a simple recital of facts regarding it  MacDonagh s book is important and I doubt if I can show its trend better than by quotation even by a very brief and fragmentary quotation of broken phrases  Difficulty in getting rid of  inversions poetic words cumbrous epithets genteel days Metaphor that can not be understood without knowledge of historic  events which have not affected Ireland Tendency to hammer the stressed syllables and slur the unstressed Music goes out of its way as it were to follow the varying ex  pression of the word This properly commended Mathew Arnold on Celtic literature largely a work of fiction When Mr A C Benson changes never into ne er in a poem by Emily Bronté for the sake of regularity MacDonagh gives him the drubbing that he deserves They have tried to do the same with the Poema del Cid though as Dr Rennert has said with such gentleness cleaning his spectacles To suppose that a man who could write a poem like that wouldn t have been able to count ten on his fingers and put ten syllables in a line if he d wanted to MacDonagh remarks further The Irish reader would be content to pronounce the words as they come to read the lines as prose reads   Thomas Macdonagh as Critic  Take the line frankly as if it were a line of prose only with the  beauty of vibration in the voice that goes with the fine grave  words of poetry There is a recurrence in this verse but it is not the recurrence of the foot  I am not quoting to back up a thesis I can not hope to give all of MacDonagh s argument It is however interesting to find Dolmetsch justifying vers libre in his book on the history of seventeenth and eighteenth century music and MacDonagh at the same time analyzing the breaking from false shackles in a quite different manner Perhaps all metric has grown in a lengthening of the bar or foot or unit At any rate there has been in our time a general and wide spread perception that the conventions and artificialities of the horse hair period are not the eternal unchanging law  Of course the rules of rimes and the rest were never arbitrary They were discovered They are nature methodised  The book contains sane remarks on assonance and its riches Its author has a shot at that old dotard Palgrave who has done considerable harm and is only kept on because his name is romantic and because there is a certain amount of capital sunk in the plates of his inefficient production  MacDonagh makes very intelligent pleas for fair translation of Gaelic and gives Stokes translation of a strophe in contrast with certain bad translations in verse Stokes says  A hedge of trees surrounds me a blackbird s lay sings to me praise which I will not hide Above my booklet the lined one the trilling of the birds sings to me In a gray mantle the cuckoo sings to me from the top of the bushes May the Lord protect me I write well under the greenwood   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  This is excellently concrete The other examples from old Irish are also convincing In the Tryst After Death we find the trail of the monk spoiling an otherwise fine poem as happens in the Saxon texts also Christianity was a handicap to all early writers in either island  Early Irish poems we might have found elsewhere I do not know where else we should be likely to hear much of contemporary writers in Gaelic of whom there seem to be several worthy of note Padraic Mac Piarais is made interesting by MacDonagh s translation  The poet once again is his own first audience His poetry is a matter between himself and himself If others afterward come and share his joy the gain is theirs  MacDonagh s book is well larded with common sense He was one of the few people who could write intelligibly on matters of metric and also readably His loss is a loss both to Ireland and to literature and it is a loss bound to be more felt as his work becomes more widely known Though this last book of his is addressed in the main to the Gael the subtlety and the sanity of the general criticism contained in it should win for it a wider audience Ezra Pound  TH E TRADITION OF MAGIC  The Listeners by Walter De La Mare Henry Holt amp Co  Thoughtful and analytic writers are all about us and their numbers are growing rapidly Not content with uttering mere editorial dicta they have invaded the musty quiet of our revered journals of opinion they have even   The Tradition of Magic  appeared in the rose curtained and violet scented boudoirs of the fifteen cent magazines The world has never been so full of keen and clever men The impulse of self study has become not only personal but popular And with surprising results The song makers in particular have been caught in the tremendous tide of new tendencies they give us the secret of everything from mid western villages to fire engines from the old formalism to the new freedom from socialism to psycho analysis It is not rare to find a poet who is full of meaning But it is rare to find one who is even touched with magic  At least that is true in America Our poets have been so pushed and crowded with thoughts that they have had little time to be thoughtless But England has always even in the thick of war developed this quality She has fostered what amounts to a tradition of magic Nothing could better illustrate this unbroken stream that has run down from Spenser through Shakespeare and Herrick and Keats and Blake than three unaffected English singers of the present day Unaffected I might add in every way for while Masefield was animating English verse with rich vulgarisms while W W Gibson was dramatizing the laborers of London and Abercrombie putting his Gloucester folk into close packed blank verse Ralph Hodgson W H Davies and Walter De La Mare kept on writing their curiously untimely and curiously beautiful poetry All three are strangers here although the little yellow booklets of Hodgson now published by the Poetry Bookshop in London are beginning to be sought after   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ever since the news of his winning the Polignac prize became known Hodgson was introduced to America by E V Lucas a little over a year ago in a graceful and appreciative causerie Mr Lucas quoted as examples of Hodgson s love of simplicity and rage at oppression such haunting lyrics as Stupidity Street The Gipsy Girl and fragments of the longer poems The Bull The Song of Honor and the exquisite Eve But he did not mention Time you old Gipsy Man that fragment of Hodgson s that shows him at his clearest and possibly his most magical The first half follows  Time you old gipsy man  Will you not stay  Put up your caravan  Just for one day  All things I ll give you Will you be my guest Bells for your jennet Of silver the best Goldsmiths shall beat you A great folden ring Peacocks shall bow to you Little boys sing Oh and sweet girls will Festoon you with may Time you old gipsy man Why hasten away  Davies gift is less delicate and more obvious it is a bit  foreseen prepared one might even call his a mathematical  magic Also his indebtedness to Blake and Herrick is more  apparent Yet he has an idiom that is his own an idiom  that is as fresh and clean as his naif vision His Songs of  Joy and Others 1911 show him in his most characteristic   The Tradition of Magic  moods and measures particularly in such dissimilar poems as Days too Short Shopping the limpid and rare blank verse of The Child and The Mariner and this snatch The Example  Here s an example from A butterfly That on a rough hard rock  Happy can lie Friendless and all alone On this unsweetened stone  Now let my bed be hard No care take I I ll make my joy like this  Small butterfly Whose happy heart has power To make a stone a flower  Walter De La Mare is the only one of the three to have achieved an American publisher and we may hope that the reception of The Listeners will warrant the reprinting of the author s earlier Peacock Pie which though it lacks the power and intensity of The Listeners has as fine a magic and even more mellowness and mirth The first third of it contains more inspired and unforgettable nursery rhymes and nonsense lyrics than were ever collected anywhere except in Mother Goose s own anthology  De La Mare s distinction lies not so much in what he says as in the accent in which he says it It is an utterance that lifts his work above its old fashioned turns and archaisms Nor do these poetic left overs bother him he uses inversions constantly and carelessly one might almost say he uses them confidently for infusing them with new salience he makes   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  these old tags and makeshifts surprisingly fresh and alive He can even put words like burgeon thridding amaranthine and athwart into his verse without making them seem like the dead sea fruit of poetry that they are He writes someone has said as much for antiquity as for posterity he is in the world yet not wholly of it Moonlight and mystery seem soaked in all his lines and a cool wind from Nowhere blows over them That most magical of all modern verses The Listeners which gives the recent volume its title is a splendid illustration of this It has in it something of the supernatural beauty and horror that is found in Algernon Blackwood s tales but unlike Blackwood s the story is not told it is barely suggested What we get is the effect of the ghost story rather than the narrative itself Never have silence and black night been reproduced so startlingly as in these lines Utterly different but no less memorable are Rachel An Epitaph Martha and the grave whimsy of The Sleeper with its slumber drenched picture  Even her hands upon her lap Seemed saturate with sleep  Or this decorative winter piece as skilfully simple as a Hiroshige color print There blooms no bud in May Can for its white compare With snow at break of day On fields forlorn and bare   Fearful of its pale glare In flocks the starlings rise Slide through the frosty air And perch with plaintive cries   The Tradition of Magic  Only the inky rook Hunched cold in ruffled wings Its snowy nest forsook Caws of unnumbered springs Or in a less delineative and more elfish mood The Wind with its macabre humor or in a more sturdy half heroic vein The Scarecrow or that most quiet colored and musical of all written nocturnes Nod the beginning and end of which run Softly along the road of evening In a twilight dim with rose Wrinkled with age and drenched with dew Old Nod the shepherd goes   His lambs outnumber a noon s roses Yet when night s shadow s fall His blind old sheep dog Slumber soon Misses not one at all  His are the quiet steeps of dreamland The waters of no more pain His ram s bell rings neath an arch of stars Rest rest and rest again He writes with the sophistication of the artist and the mind of a child And like most imaginative children his pictures are the reflection of a mood that is half lost in phantasy half in fear Hodgson Davies De La Mare they make a trio of unusual voices voices that rise with a strange color and sweetness in these dark and unsweetened days  Louis Untermeyer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MODERN MONOLOGUES  Flashlights by Mary Aldis Duffield amp Co  Years ago Emerson said that he thought the dramatic monologue was destined to supersede all other forms of poetry To prophecy the absolute dominance of any one form of poetry is a dangerous and one may say a futile thing to do but still the dramatic monologue does seem a peculiarly sympathetic form in which to render the psychological subtleties of modern life Mrs Aldis s book contains many monologues and duologues and I have no hesitation in saying that it is just these poems which are the most successful in her arresting volume  Mrs Aldis is first of all a dramatist as her previous book Plays for Small Stages proved And it is the dramatic instinct which has urged her to poetry The book is divided into three sections the first City Sketches and the last Stories in Metre are frankly dramatic Only the middle section to which no name is given contains lyrics and in these the author falls far below the level set in the earlier and later poems Mrs Aldis has a remarkable power of penetrating the personality of a character of thinking his or her thoughts and speaking them in his or her words She is stimulated by contact with these creatures of her imagination and strikes a white heat for their portrayal With an eager and faithful sympathy she walks the streets of her city and mirrors the life she sees streaming by her on the sidewalks and murmuring from open windows above   Modem Monologues  The merest shadow of contact and the poet has grasped the intentness of a situation the meaning of an action the cause of an expression This is the gift of the dramatist The lyrist functions from unity the dramatist from duality Every true writer of drama needs himself plus the outside world the lyrist only requires the first of these equations Shorn of her fictitious characters Mrs Aldis is only partly herself Her dramatic sketches may be extremely slight but they are always crisp and sure as in this little thumb nail drawing  FLASHLIGHTS  The winter dusk creeps up the Avenue With biting cold Behind bright window panes In gauzy garments Waxen ladies smile As shirt sleeved men Hustle them off their pedestals for the night  Along the Avenue A girl comes hurrying Holding her shawl She stops to look in at the window Oh Gee she says look at the chiffon muff A whimpering dog Falters up to cringe against her skirt  Now take this lyric SEEKING  Swift like the lark Out of the dark One cometh singing  Silent in flight Out of the night Answer is winging   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Forth to the dawn  Leaps like a fawn  A cry of high greeting  Into the sun  Two that have run  Seeking are meeting  The crispness has gone and instead of the sure swift simple words we have the old weak poetic jargon of One cometh singing we have worn similes such as Swift like the lark or Leaps like a fawn  The critic is inclined to believe these to be early poems but the lyric To Maurice Brown must be recent and here too is a wooliness vagueness of treatment and a slipping into old epithets like wan hands and glory from the earth and sky with the weakness of a tortured inversion in Draughtsman terrible which are never to be found in the dramatic poems  As a dramatic poet Mrs Aldis has few equals in present day poetry She is almost as stark as Mr Masters and more pitying and if she has neither the broad sense of society en masse of Mr Sandburg nor the masterful detachment of Mr Frost she is in some ways more pathetic than either There is a tender feminine compassion under all the vulgar misery of her stories which tears at the reader s heart and makes these poems sharp with anguish  Mrs Aldis deals with the most sordid elements of our urban population Her people do not follow the clean strong professions of men who earn their day s wages by the sweat of their hands Instead she reveals the lives of men and women who batten on the more degenerate the more luxurious and effeminate instincts of our population   Modem Monologues  Here are Barber Shops Manicure Establishments Vapor Baths the hundred and one unvigorous unedifying trades with their painful concomitants of a Park Bench at night a Police Magistrate s room a Prison and an Insane Asylum And yet so fine is Mrs Aldis s art that in almost every case these sordid precincts throw off their sordidness to become merely the pitiful backgrounds of tragedy in her skilful hands Window wishing is one of the finest and most tender of these stories Reason is the most terrible There is keen irony in Love in the Loop and Converse The dedication is the one lyric in the book which can rank in treatment with the stories These are the last two stanzas  My book upon some quiet shelf Beneath your touch Shall wake perhaps And speak again My wonder my delight My questioning before the night  And as you read Somewhere afar I shall be singing singing  Altogether a most interesting book full of sincerity high minded endeavor and notable achievement  Amy Lowell  A PARODIST  and Other Poets by Louis Untermeyer Henry  Holt amp Co  Good parody is one of the most convincing and diverting forms of criticism Mr Louis Untermeyer in his latest volume is always critic and usually more poet satirist wag   parasite doppelgànger man of the moment The last most markedly anyone who has not followed closely the developments of the new poetry within the past year or two will get from Mr Untermeyer but a qualified pleasure In each instance he is not burlesquing a particular poem but is after a particular poet He is less concerned with the poet s output than with the poet s essential nature He gets under his subject s skin and functions as that subject s self When you have read the imitations of Frost Lindsay Masters Amy Lowell Ezra Pound and the other Recents you have come pretty close to seeing the world through their eyes feeling it through their senses and reaching a pungent apprehension of their respective tastes predilections and range of thought  A second section of the book presents fancied collaborations between poets early and late its super ingenuities may spur the jaded senses of those to whom parody in mere single harness no longer makes a strong address A third section embraces a variety of miscellaneous trifles which though skittishly clever do not seem to call very decidedly for preservation H B F   OUR CONTEMPORARIES  A NEW QUARTERLY  Form a Quarterly of the Arts edited by Austin O Spare  and Francis Marsden John Lane London and New  York  I can not imagine why this new international quarterly is called Form unless it is meant as a form or style book of various specimens of typography for the aspect of the periodical reminds one of nothing so much as of specimen pages of typography and inks from The Inland Printer The typography ranges from cold font type to many different varieties of hand lettering It is not quite exact to say that no two pages are alike but of the verse at least it is true that no two adjacent contributions are printed alike nor in one instance is one page confined to a single style of calligraphy Some of the poems are printed throughout in black ink others with red titles and capitals A poem by  T Sturge Moore is all in red and in Charms by W H Davies we find the couplets alternately black and red  With so much confusion to the eye it was difficult at first to do more than see the poems en bloc and while in this mood I discovered that the best things in the magazine as far as the graphic arts go are Frank Brangwyn s woodcut Charles Ricketts lithograph and the four small wood cuts by Roald Kristian Charles Shannon s composition for his circular wood cut tries to go around with the circle and doesn t succeed The full page drawings by Austin O Spare are pathetically of the schools the kind of good utterly lifeless drawings of which one sees hundreds in any school concours with a little dash of symbolism of very obvious allegory thrown in It is very Anglais Likewise the supposed grotesques by Mr Spare and by Philip Newston have no element of the grotesque about them The grotesque is not so far as the artistic or the aesthetic sense is concerned either ugly or evil And all that is ugly is not grotesque These drawings do not achieve the distinction of being evil  It is not surprising that Edmund J Sullivan in an article accompanying these drawings mentions as a notable feature of the grotesque certain monstrosities of nature such as the Siamese twins or worse But there is nothing grotesque about the botched jobs of nature Mr Sullivan says In nature the borderland of the funny and absurd exists But this is not true it is only in our perception which is far from absolute that the borderland exists We have no right to assume that the Creator finds us any less funny and absurd than the dodo or the hippopotamus Caliban would not have been a grotesque without Shakespeare The grotesque is conditioned by the artist in the hands of the artist it has the same elements of force unity beauty strength that his work which presents a more conventionally ordered conception of beauty reveals The grotesque in art must and can be defined in terms of art The grotesque in nature is grotesque only through art  But this subject is engrossing and so might be that of automatic drawing on which notes are contributed by   A New Quarterly  Frederick Carter and drawings by Mr Spare One might take this more seriously if the results given promised more for art than for psycho analysis Mr Carter also contributes several designs not automatic One of these Rumors could have been handled with much more force by one of The Masses artists but I don t know how many people in London know The Masses  As for the rest of the magazine Mr Leonard Inkster s remarks on Imitation begin where they end in a vague mist Harold Massingham contributes a satiric sketch called The Idealists Limited and R B Cunningham Graham an interesting impression of buying horses in South America for the war Edward Eastaway has a good poem called Lob presenting an essentially English pixy who reappears in country lanes and other places through the centuries I don t know after all whether one can say much more of the other poems than that they are respectively characteristic of their authors as one knows them W H Davies Charms is written in couplets obviously and intentionally reminiscent of Herrick or Blake In The Visitor however under the mask of a conventional form he gives us an image strikingly concrete and vivid without bursting the old bottle no doubt it would delight the heart of an imagist Harold Massingham s Recipe for an Imagist Poem fails to produce one The poems of Walter De La Mare and T Sturge Moore one apiece have a certain distinction Other poems are by Laurence Binyon Laurence Housman J C Squire Francis Burrows and Lady Margaret Sackville Of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  course I have kept the eight new poems by W B Yeats till the last These at least would appease me for the lack of form that I find on the whole in Form They did and they do for I found them none the less beautiful for being already familiar they were published in the February 1916 number of POETRY and they are reprinted without a word of acknowledgment A C H  ARTIST VERSUS AMATEUR  One would hardly expect to find in The Little Review such advice as that given by Mr Harold Bauer in The Compleat Amateur or How Not To Be An Artist but it is precisely what one would expect of Mr Bauer And after all the delightful thing about The Little Review is its unexpectedness When asked to write an article Mr Bauer said that writing was not his art Nevertheless he gave some very pertinent or impertinent suggestions among them the two following  Le style fait l homme  If you want to become an author give up your life to the study of calligraphy if a painter devote yourself to the manufacture of paints and brushes if a composer commit to memory the number of notes in every standard classical work and if a singer or instrumentalist spend your whole energy in the establishing of a sound technical foundation Emotional expression can then if desired be subsequently spread like treacle on bread over all these different stylic bases this operation requiring neither skill nor expression  Personality or as some authorities have it individuality  This is the greatest asset of the amateur An artist is like everybody in the world The book we read the picture we see or the music we hear which renders tangible our own dimly felt thoughts and emotional stirrings shows that we are in reality one with the   Artist versus Amateur  artist and with the universe of which these expressions are but  reflections of unseen and unheard forces An artist combines the power and responsibilities of the aristocrat with the feelings of an anarchist he is the guardian of privilege and the destroyer of authority the leveler of barriers and the creator of the superman the leader and servant of humanity and the Arch Enemy of the Amateur The Artist is like all humanity but the Amateur is not like the Artist The Amateur must hang on for dear life to his precious soul and resist to the last gasp the incursions of any outside force in which he can trace the semblance of his own nature for if anything gets in something may get out and he won t be able to sort himself out afterwards Hence the Amateur must be an Individualist otherwise he is doomed to extinction   ROBERT FROST S QUALITY  It is not easy to define the exact quality of Robert Frost s poems but a certain characteristic of The Home Stretch in the July Century is characteristic of them all a sense that is of the significance of the apparently insignificant moments of life he makes us feel these moments to be as important as they really are It is very much like that light of permanence in which the little Dutch masters saw and painted their otherwise commonplace interiors It is what Mr Frost makes of his New England scenes and characters that counts His imitators of which there begin to be some will never get more than a husk of externality they might as well imitate Will Carleton s Farm Ballads  This poet never takes the bloom off the thing he gives us His precision is in giving us chemicals in a state of solution of inter action before they have crystallized or formed a new substance This by the way is like Tchekoff He does not overstate he does not characterize His specimens are   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  not pinned to the paper It is hardly a delight in poetry for the sake of poetry that we get from him but a sense of life His is essentially the feeling of drama in volume that is not on the surface What we call dramatic today is often only a superficial nervous twitching When Robert Frost gives us a man we get as it were the shadow of his bulk first his spiritual features are only gradually revealed as a rock might emerge from shadow but the man is never cut off or away from his surroundings A C H  WHAT WILL HE DO WITH IT  Rupert Brooke whose collected Poems John Lane is so slight and yet so fine a monument to his short young life has been honored signally by Yale university The Henry Howland memorial prize of 1 500 every second year awarded to the citizen of any country for marked distinction in literature fine arts or the science of government has been awarded to Rupert Brooke Exchange  It used to be a saying that the only good Indian was a  dead Indian Apparently that is the way it is with poets  Yet one can not help asking the ironical fruitless question  What good will this cash prize do Rupert Brooke and how  will it be conveyed to him   What Will He Do With It  NOTES  Sir
