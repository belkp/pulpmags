NOVEMBER 1922  THE EVENING LAND  O AMERICA The sun sets in you Are you the grave of our day  Shall I come to you the open tomb of my race  I would come if I felt my hour had struck I would rather you came to me  For that matter Mahomet never went to any mountain Save it had first approached him and cajoled his soul  You have cajoled the souls of millions of us America   Why won t you cajole my soul I wish you would  I confess I am afraid of you  The catastrophe of your exaggerate love You who never find yourself in love But only lose yourself further decomposing  You who never recover out of the orgasm of loving Your pristine isolate integrity lost aeons ago Your singleness within the universe  You who in loving break down And break further and further down Your bounds of isolation But who never rise resurrected from this grave of  mingling In a new proud singleness America  Your more than European idealism Like a be aureoled bleached skeleton hovering Its cage ribs in the social heaven beneficent  And then your single resurrection Into machine uprisen perfect man  Even the winged skeleton of your bleached ideal Is not so frightening as that clean smooth Automaton of your uprisen self  Machine American   D H Lawrence  Do you wonder that I am afraid to come And answer the first machine cut question from the lips of  your iron men Put the first cents into metallic fingers of your officers And sit beside the steel straight arms of your fair women American  I am so terrified America Of the solid click of your human contact  And after this The winding sheet of your selfless ideal love  Boundless love Like a poison gas  Does no one realize that love should be intense Not boundless This boundless love is like the bad smell Of something gone wrong in the middle All this philanthropy and benevolence on other people s  behalf Just a bad smell  Yet America  Your elvishness  Your New England uncanniness  Your western brutal faery quality  My soul is half cajoled half cajoled  Something in you which carries me beyond   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Yankee Yankee  What we call human  Carries me where I want to be carried  What does it matter What we call human and what we don t call human The rose would smell as sweet And to be limited by a mere word is to be less than a  hopping flea which hops over such an obstruction  at his first jump  Your horrible skeleton aureoled ideal Your weird bright perfect productive mechanism Two spectres  But moreover A dark unfathomed wistfulness utterly un Jewish A grave stoic endurance non European An ultimate fearlessness un African An irrational generosity non Oriental  The strange unaccustomed geste of your elvish New World nature Glimpsed now and then  Nobody knows you You don t know yourself And I who am half in love with you What am I in love with My own imaginings   D H Lawrence  Say it is not so  Say through the branches America America Of all your machines Say in the deep sockets of your idealistic skull Dark aboriginal eyes Stoic able to wait through ages Glancing  Say in the sound of all your machines And white words white wash American Deep pulsing of a strange heart New throb like a stirring under the false dawn that  precedes the real  Nascent American Elvish lurking among the undergrowth Of many stemmed machines and chimneys that smoke like  pine trees  Dark faery Modern unissued instinctive America Your nascent faery people Lurking among the deeps of your industrial thicket Allure me till I am beside myself A nympholept  These States as Whitman said Whatever he meant    TURKEY COCK  You ruffled black blossom You glossy dark wind  Your sort of gorgeousness Dark and lustrous And unfathomable And poppy glossy Is the gorgeousness that evokes my darkest admiration  Your aboriginality Deep unexplained Like a Red Indian darkly sumptuous and aloof Seems like the black and glossy seeds of wonderful cen  turies  Your wattles are the color of steel which has been red hot And is going cold Cooling to a powdery pale oxidized sky blue  Why do you have wattles and a naked wattled head Why do you arch your naked set eye with a more than comprehensible haughtiness  The vulture is bald so is the condor obscenely But only you have thrown this amazing mantilla of oxidized sky blue And hot red over you   D H Lawrence  This queer fine shawl of blue and vermilion Whereas the peacock has a diadem  I wonder why Perhaps it is a sort of Spanish discretion a veil Perhaps it is your reserve in all this ostentation Your wattles drip down like a shawl to your breast And the point of your mantilla drops across your nose  Some races veil the head And some put flowers in the hair to attract attention  Or perhaps there is something in your wattles of a bull s dew lap Which slips down like a pendulum to balance the throbbing mass of a generous breast The over drip of a great passion hanging in the balance  You contract yourself You arch yourself as an archer s bow Which quivers indrawn as you clench your spine Until your veiled head almost touches backward To the root rising of your erected tail And one intense and backward curving frisson Seizes you as you clench yourself together Like some fierce magnet bringing its poles together  Burning pale positive pole of your wattled head And from the darkness of that opposite one The upstart of your round barred sun round tail   Whilst between the two along the tense arched curve of  your back Blows the magnetic current in fierce blasts Ruffling black shining feathers like lifted mail Shuddering storm wind or a water rushing through  Your august super sensual haughtiness Tosses the crape of red across your brow and down your breast As you draw yourself upon yourself in pride  It is a declaration of such tension in pride As Time has not dared to avouch nor eternity been unable to unbend Do what it may  The peacock lifts his rods of bronze And struts blue brilliant out of the far East But watch a turkey prancing low on earth Drumming his vaulted wings as savages drum Their rhythms on long drawn hollow sinister drums The ponderous sombre sound of the great drum of  Huichilobos In pyramid Mexico during sacrifice Drum and the turkey onrush Sudden demoniac dauntlessness full abreast All the bronze gloss of all his myriad petals Each one apart and instant Delicate frail crescent of the gentle outline of white   D H Lawrence  At each feather tip So delicate Yet the bronze wind bell suddenly clashing And the eye over weening into madness  Turkey cock turkey cock Are you the bird of the next dawn  Has the peacock had his day does he call in vain screecher for the sun to rise The eagle the dove and the barnyard shouter do they  call in vain trying to wake the morrow And do you await us wattled father Westward Will your yell do it  Take up the trail of the vanished American Where it disappeared at thè foot of the crucifix Take up the primordial pride The more than human dense magnificence And disdain and indifference and onrush and pry open  the new day with them  Is the East a dead letter and Europe moribund But those sumptuous dead feather lustrous Aztecs  Amerindians In all the sombre splendor of their red blood Stand under the dawn half godly awaiting the cry  of the turkey cock  D H Lawrence   THREE POEMS  IN THEIR IMAGE  I am one of the wind s stories I am a fancy of the rain A memory of the high moon s glories The hint the sunset had of pain  They dreamed me as they dreamed all other Hawthorn and I I and the grass With sister shade and phantom brother Across their sleep I glide and pass  Twilight is in my blood my being Mingles with trees and ferns and stones Thunder and stars my lips are freeing And there is sea rack in my bones  Those that have dreamed me shall out wake me But I go hence with flowers and weeds I am no more to those who make me Than other drifting fruit and seeds  And though I love them mourn to leave them Sea earth and sunset stars and streams My tears my passing do not grieve them Other dreams have they other dreams   Muriel Stuart  THE SEED SHOP  Here in a quiet and dusty room they lie Faded as crumbled stone and shifting sand Forlorn as ashes shrivelled scentless dry Meadows and gardens running through my hand  Dead that shall quicken at the voice of spring Sleepers to wake beneath June s tempest kiss Though birds pass over unremembering And no bee find here roses that were his  In this brown husk a dale of hawthorn dreams A cedar in this narrow cell is thrust That shall drink deeply at a century s streams These lilies shall make summer on my dust  Here in their safe and simple house of death Sealed in their shells a million roses leap Here I can stir a garden with my breath And in my hand a forest lies asleep  IN THE ORCHARD  I thought you loved me No it was only fun  When we stood there closer than all Well the harvest moon Was shining and queer in your hair and it turned my head   That made you Yes Just the moon and the light it made Under the tree Well your mouth too Yes my mouth  And the quiet there that sang like the drum in the booth You shouldn t have danced like that Like what So close With your head turned up and the flower in your hair a rose That smelt all warm I loved you I thought you knew I wouldn t have danced like that with any but you  I didn t know I thought you knew it was fun  I thought it was love you meant Well it s done  Yes it s done I ve seen boys stone a blackbird and watched them drown A kitten it clawed at the reeds and they pushed it  down Into the pool while it screamed Is that fun too  Well boys are like that Your brothers Yes I know But you so lovely and strong Not you Not you   Muriel Stuart  They don t understand it s cruel It s only a game  And are girls fun too No still in a way it s the same It s queer and lovely to have a girl Go on  It makes you mad for a bit to feel she s your own And you laugh and kiss her and maybe you give her a ring But it s only in fun But I gave you everything  Well you shouldn t have done it you know what a fellow thinks When a girl does that Yes he talks of her over his drinks And calls her a Stop that now I thought you knew  But it wasn t with anyone else it was only you  How did I know I thought you wanted it too I thought you were like the rest Well what s to be done  To be done Is it all right Yes Sure Yes but why   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I don t know I thought you were going to cry You said you had something to tell me Yes I know It wasn t anything really I think I ll go  Yes it s late There s thunder about a drop of rain Fell on my hand in the dark I ll see you again At the dance next week You re sure that everything s  right  Yes Well I ll be going Kiss me Good night Good night  Muriel Stuart  SIXTEEN  Love is a very big thing a very great thing mother And I am afraid I love you that is what he said But he looked away as he spoke And he faltered when he kissed me Love is a very big thing a very great thing mother And I am afraid  Edward Pickerill   FATHER WHERE DO THE WILD SWANS GO  Father where do the wild swans go Far far Ceaselessly winging Their necks outstraining they haste them singing Far far Whither none may know  Father where do the cloud ships go Far far The winds pursue them And over the shining heaven strew them Far far Whither none may know  Father where do the days all go  Far far Each runs and races No one can catch them they leave no traces Far far Whither none may know  But father we where do we then go  Far far Our dim eyes veiling With bended head we go sighing wailing Far far Whither none may know  Translated from the Danish of Ludwig Holstein by Charles Wharton Stork   BUS RIDE IN A FOG  Out from the house to the street From the colored and sounding house To the thin grey shape of the street as it steals Before one s feet Like a mouse  A wavering lamp competes With the darkness from vacancy spring Tall trees by the pavement s edge till it wheels To the high street s Beckoning  The bus Up a phantom stair And alone on a spectral seat And the endless purr of the wheels as we go To a bell somewhere Down the street  And the street is a tale that is told And a wraith is London town Under ochre seas oh far below Is her glory her gold Gone down  From shadows among the shades In a city that once has been   V H Friedlaender  Here a muted voice swims half into ken There a white face fades Half seen  And still the drone of the bus Like a coma a swoon a drug  Dead dead down down among all dead men And your grave with us Is dug  Out from the sulphurous soul Out from the tortured heart Of the purgatorial city where death Is the goal And the better part  The journey s end to arrive How queer how almost pain To stretch stiff limbs and recover breath To come alive Again  V H Friedlaender   POETRY  BLACK LONDON  I  Dust of the noon day world Scattering over the land Dust from the rags of the world Falls on the dusk of my hand  Out of the east and west Out of the north and south Over my brow and eyes Over my hands and mouth  II  What will you have from me  You have not taken yet  Take or it may be late  Take or I may forget  This is the time of times  Dear for your gathering  Quick for the cross eyed crow  Flaps with her fatal wing  III  Where Westminster Abbey shades Lean on narrow green leaf glades I a brother to the grass Stand and watch the sunlight pass   Samuel Roth  One and one more century  Here passed by so quietly  One more two more centuries  Come for all the use there is  Samuel Roth  NORTH OHIO VILLAGE  Quietness over my spirit like The shadows of an old dead town Grass between the flagstone walks Yellow houses fading to brown Lawns and streets growing to weeds and dust And the intolerable rust Of barren souls  Beyond the reach of time Last year s leaves have covered all the lawns The piercing beauty of many dawns Strikes at the day Yet old stone walls and empty garden pools Have a stale odor of gradual decay  This is the quietness of an old dog s nose Not too much heat Sometimes a chill that through the garden goes Eternal beauty fading in An agony of uncommitted sin  Frederick Shea Jesson   TWO POEMS  THE HOUSEWIFE  In that rich room it is not dusk not day  A few late sunbeams fall like silver rain And pool themselves upon the counterpane She does not notice when they move and stray So peacefully she lies Her fingers fray The covering beneath but in her brain She feels no knotting of the silken skein So softly does life wind itself away  While others restless mark the hours slow ebb And stop the tinkling bell the clicking gate Or trembling turn to listen whisper wait While Death the spider weaves its gauzy web There placidly she lies beneath its loom Planning new curtains for the living room  OLD FOLK  Two old women live in our street One is sour and the other is sweet  Here is a secret hid in youth Young lips and eyes may mask the truth  But wrinkled faces hold the print Coins they are that speak their mint   Mildred Plew Merryman  Youth is a spicy potpourri None may guess what the contents be  But old folk all must come to an hour When they turn quite plainly sweet or sour  Mildred Plew Merryman  AUTUMN  My maple tree is yellow green  Against a blue gray sky  In little groups of three and four  I see the restless pigeons fly  The air is rain washed fresh and sweet  Mingled with pungent scent of pine  Kissed by the faintest glint of sun  Amber and bronze the poplars shine  He knew the woods how many times  I ve seen him tramping in the rain  Singing among the trees he loved  The songs I ll never hear again  Francesca Rios PICTURE AHEAD  I was hikin along the road by Simmonsville I useta go out somewheres every Sunday And walk off all the dirt and noise and nerves That come from the week in the city in the store And say it was like I made myself clean over  I could see the top of the hill from where I was And I was gettin excited the way I did When I been trampin up hill for a ways In some place where I never was before And played games with myself about the view That s comin when I hit the top you know Will it be a river twistin through the woods Or a drop that makes your breath stick in your throat Or will it be only nothin after all Exceptin just the plain everyday country It s a great game I ll say I useta love it And half the fun s not knowin what is comin  Well fifty yards maybe is still to go And I stops up to get my second wind And then that sign it slaps me in the eye Picture Ahead  Can y

Of guessin what is comin on the road They tell us Hurry Get the camera out You ain t got sense enough to tell what s what You can t tell when they s anything worth seein I got so mad I went and jumped the fence And run acrost the field Damned if I d go And see a sight that was all canned you might say Or like a travel movie  All my life I had my fun pretendin to myself That every view I seen belonged to me Different from anybody s mine especial Picture Ahead  I stopped there in the field And turned aroun and beat it for the train  I just can t get the heart to go no more The country s spoilt and lots of things is spoilt Just on account that sign I feel so old And everything I see looks old and worn out  Machinery Machinery Picture Ahead    DILEMMA  Gee she s sweet So sorta eyes wide open And shiny like the street lights do at night When rain is on the sidewalk They s a somethin About the way her whole face has that light  Whenever she looks at me It always says I believe in you Oh I believe in you That face like a little flower starin at me  It scares me What should I do What can I do  I tell her not to go and dream about me I ain t no fine guy and I tell her so She keeps on thinkin I m just kiddin her  And answers back You can t fool me I know  And just to think that lovely dream about me Has got to smash all up some awful day When she finds out the way that I am really It ll hurt her so I ought to get away  Where she can t never see me any more Before that dream and all that sweetness dies But can I do it Can I do without her Can I stand not seein that lovin in her eyes  John V A Weaver   WOMEN Studies in the Erotic Emotion DIALOGUE He If I should touch you now She Flame would follow your hands Flame upon hair and brow Curling in little strands My body is light with love As a little sun drunk tree My body is pierced through He With me with me She Say over again again Anything wild and sweet He Shall we make magic names Queer to repeat She Crumple this moment up Toss it against a star He Your body is in my arms She Yet I know not where we are    MARRIED  I had sought you seeking her You were lost she was near Oh believe this of me dear  Men are queer Love s a twisted bitter thing I must cling To some inner fact of trust I ve your child here I must Say it to my sickening youth  It s the truth  Dust and shame are on my head  Quiet now Let s go to bed  INTERIOR  Since we have said it  There is no ease together  The piano is disquieted  A vague uncomfortableness  Stirs in blue curtains  I am ashamed of you  Troubling thus the wall paper   Florence Kiper Frank  BABY  Pooh men We are done with them now Who had need of them then I and you  Rounding face Little feet Hair to love You sweet  Men I shall laugh at them now Who had sighed moon sick then I have you  Florence Kiper Frank   INTERPLANES  SYMPHONIE PATHETIQUE  Your bundle of balanced hair beloved soft silky  letting lights Slip down to darkness Juggling lights fantastically colored lights dripping like  the chords of dreamed music Your eyes absorbing blue giving out blue As though your face were turned forever to an unseen sky Your hands pointed like almonds White like ivory traced with blue enamel  These are gone I see these No more  Gus the romantic lad plays old plaintive melodies on  the mandolin Trying to make me know he understands But I am feeling the slide Of your hand on my forehead Hand like weather stained ivory Written on in faded blue ink  I have chords of wistful music Crowding for you to open the gate To drift off like smoke Over aged hills   Robert J Roe  PORTRAIT OF A MAN  I did it yes he said And looked at me When I asked him If the things they said of him were true His neighbors gabbling amongst themselves  He looked at me His eyes were clear as water And there shone A mystical elation on his face I did it yes Was all he said  APPRENTICE  You bid me sing The deep harmonies of stars But how can I sing of stars When I cannot chant for you How mountains at sunset Are like far off purple isles In a varnished saffron sea  Or how shall I prophesy concerning planets Who am unable To explain how the bony backed mesa With bare flanks blown in and out with shadows Is like a lean horse sniffing spring   CORTEGE  Winter s gone with melancholy tolling of bells To the tolling of slow bells The cortege winds up the canyon On the north trail  Clanging a heavy bell Flying dark banners  DEATH  What can death do to you That life has not already done What do you fear  It is a gentle falling Of the light A splendor is done  Twilight some stars appear Silently one by one A stranger splendor is begun  Robert J Roe  A  COMMENT  FLAMBOYANCE  AMERICA needs the flamboyant to save her soul so said Vachel Lindsay at one of those Glacier Park camp fires where he and Stephen Graham talked of art and life to the indifferent mountains  He might have added that America tries to satisfy this need in strange and often uncatalogued ways America living an exemplary three meals a day and bed time life in a wall papered home goes now and then en masse to the circus to see men women and animals perform exquisite and impossible feats of grace and daring What could be more flamboyant than the trapeze performer hurtling through the air the tiger leaping through man made hoops or the elephant poising his mighty bulk on his two forelegs lifted to the top of bottles What more flamboyant than the painted clown timeless type of the race laughing that he may not weep grinning through a thousand tragic jests while little human beings perform their miraculous tricks around him  And America sitting respectably at home with its newspaper America suppressing its feelings and censoring its artists America fearing emotion as the gateway to perdition America finds the flamboyant in the courts and listens to every passion molded word uttered to judge and jury in Reno or New Brunswick or South Bend  Jazz the Follies the flapper in orange and green gown   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and war paint of rouge the skyscraper lighting its thousand windows the airplane skimming the clouds the freshman shouting his college yell these are all extravagant impossible frenzies of color in a world that refuses to be drab Even the movies devoid as they are of color in the physical sense are gaudy in the imaginations of the people who watch them gaudy with exaggerated romance exaggerated comedy exaggerated splendor or grotesqueness or passion Human souls who are not living impassioned lives not creating romance and splendor and grotesqueness phases of beauty s infinite variety such people wistfully try to find these things outside themselves a futile often a destructive quest  The imagination will not down If it is not a dance a song it becomes an outcry a protest If it is not flamboyance it becomes deformity if it is not art it becomes crime Men and women can not be content any more than children with the mere facts of a humdrum life the imagination must adorn and exaggerate life must give it splendor and grotesqueness beauty and infinite depth And the mere acceptance of these things from without is not enough it is not enough to agree and assert when the imagination demands for satisfaction creative energy Flamboyance expresses faith in that energy it is a shout of delight a declaration of richness It is at least the beginning of art  H M   A Texas Prize Contest  A TEXAS PRIZE CONTEST  The Southern Methodist University at Dallas Texas recently emerged from a prize contest which had a strange denouement Three prizes were offered for original poems first a National Prize of one hundred dollars open to all undergraduate students in American colleges second a Texas Prize of fifty dollars open to all residents of the state and third a S M U Prize of twenty five dollars open only to S M U students Three independent committees were appointed to award the three prizes containing poets as well known as Messrs Bynner Benet and Wheelock The net result of the three separate deliberations was that all three prizes went to the same poem which had been submitted separately in the three contests Sketches of the Texas Prairie by George  D Bond a student of the S M U The prize poem and a number of honorable mentions have been issued in a pamphlet by the S M U professor of English Mr Jay B Hubbell The entries are quite encouraging as to the undergraduate talent sheltered and let us hope encouraged by American colleges Apparently all these young students of the art write simply and in modern diction there is a refreshing absence of contractions and inversions and old fashioned poetic phrasing Free verse of a rather loose type in most cases is used oftener than rhyme and exact metrics but although this  is a dangerous form for beginners one finds now and then some intuition of its rhythms   The prize poem consists of five brief sections perhaps the fourth A Summer Night will suggest its motive and movement Only the locusts cry in the black midnight Only the wind stirs in the lonely grass No light no other life no other sound Only the vast black prairie and the dim limitless space where the  worlds revolve And in the dark the prairie lies awake and restless Impatient of man s control hating his cities and his fences and himself Waiting for him to join the mammoth and the laelaps Knowing his time will come and waiting waiting waiting Biding her time to rise and cover him up Dreaming a dream of cities silent deserted And of prairie grass creeping slowly over their ruins Dreaming a dream of a tyrant overcome and of many many bones  beneath the thick wild flowers Dreaming a dream of many years of silence broken only by the song of the wind and the cry of the locust  Two poems by girls must have given Mr Bond a close call if the judges had any respect for genuinely feminine emotion as a motive for poetry Eighteen by Janet Pressley of the University of Nebraska is exquisite in feeling though it must be confessed weak as an attempt at free verse rhythms In Adolescence Irene Glasscock of Mount Holyoke College is on safer ground with blank verse though she has not yet acquired much subtlety of sound or phrase The poem however has emotion and shape and climax  I am so much a child that without end I play at games and childishly believe My own pretendings ever fill my days With changing faiths and loves and strange young griefs That I invent And though I quickly tire   A Texas Prize Contest  Of each toy passion still with eagerness As keen I turn to the next game and cry At length I love or This time I believe And yet I know sometimes that I have found No God who was not tenuous as smoke Of fragrant futile incense never love Of which I could say certainly The years Will not touch this nor any grief a month Would not suffice to mend And to my youth The thought is terrible that age or death May find me still absorbed in child s pretence Stretching vain hands to touch reality  These it must be remembered are student poems the work of undergraduates In the Texas contest there was no such limitation and one may reasonably question the award of the Texas Prize to Mr Bond One of the committee John Hall Wheelock gave first place to Karle Wilson Baker s Song of the Fore runners and probably the state of Texas will endorse his verdict by remembering it longest Here is the poem  The men who made Texas Rode west with dazzled eyes On the hot trail of the Future To take her by surprise  They were dreamers on horseback Dreamers with strong hands Trailing the golden Lion That couches in far lands  Old men and young men little men and tall Bad men and good men but strong men all  The women who bore Texas Could see beyond the sun They sat on cabin doorsteps When the long day was done   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And they crooned to lusty babies But their look was far away For they gazed straight through the sunset To the unborn day  Stern women laughing women women stout or small Bronzed women broken women brave women all  The men who made Texas Laughed at fate and doom Dreamers on horseback Men who needed room  And the women in young Texas Hanging homespun clothes to dry Loved a prairie for a dooryard For meeting house the sky  Wide visions and wide spaces man and land were large of lung Texas knew not cheap and easy slack and small when she was young  But the men who made Texas Left their work half done For nothing stands full finished Beneath the spinning sun  And the women who dreamed Texas Had much work to do When they lay down for their last sleep In a land still new  And a yet unbuilded Texas cloud paved and glimmering Burns yet before the eyes of us who toil and dream and sing  The S M U announces that all three prizes will be repeated next year the entries to reach Dallas by March 15th 1923 Undergraduates in any American college may address Mr Hubbell

as a fear of becoming ancient through a process of thinking We are impatient on the verge of inspection and would rather trust to our small emotions first Ours is the continuous modern motley The motley however has given us among others Ezra Pound a poet and critic who has been able through the last decade or two of our renascent disclosures in poetry and prose with their vagrant discrepancies their legerdemain exhibitions and their impudencies in manner to maintain underneath a disillusioned equilibrium Without stopping at the market place to deal in small sales being in the business of poetry and art he explored some of its earlier sources This in itself is beyond the usual procedure of American poets and the mental conclusiveness required by this stretch back to static sources is a little too stiff for their homespun conceptions and their sacred sentimentalities The feat has inspired from time to time many amusing protests and has succeeded in stirring up more than a few inactive dregs But Pound with his unique indifference rises without even the ambitious clamorings of effort above irritations and denials  Let us look into this man and see what he has done for American poetry He says in The Spirit of Romance   The spirit of the arts is dynamic The arts are not passive nor static nor in a sense are they reflective though reflection may assist at their birth  Poetry is about as much a criticism of life as red hot iron is a criticism of fire  Now this with its confidence might easily be mistaken as a point against Pound in that certain callous and inflexible minds fail to detect or to receive any surcharge of dynamic force from his poetry The matter explains itself as one of identification whether one is susceptible to mental experiences and recognizes a play on those experiences or whether one is responsive only to his own immediate contacts The dynamics of Pound come from the percussion of sustained intellect He has no elemental compromises to make and he is too sure of himself to be confused So confirmed in his contentions has he become in fact that the frequency with which he rehearses his position in the poems of this last book borders on a designed but gracious acceptance  He strove to resuscitate the dead art Of poetry to maintain the sublime In the old sense Wrong from the start  No hardly but seeing he had been born In a half savage country out of date Bent resolutely on wringing lilies from the acorn Capaneus trout for factitious bait  And this half humorously half cynically gives his present mood toward his art  For this agility chance found  Him of all men unfit  As the red beaked steeds of   Ezra Pound Today  The Cytherean for a chain bit  Invitation mere invitation to perceptivity Gradually led him to the isolation Which these presents place Under a more tolerant perhaps examination  By constant elimination The manifest universe Yielded an armor Against utter consternation  A Minoan undulation Seen we admit amid ambrosial circumstances Strengthened him against The discouraging doctrine of chances  And his desire for survival Faint in the most strenuous moods Became an Olympian apathein In the presence of selected perceptions  Here is the final deduction the proposed estimate the elevated resume without the enumeration of uninteresting activities The synthesis without the catalogue  The poseur mannerisms with which Pound s poetry seems to some critics to be infested which they believe to be deliberately spouted out for their amusement is not the important thing or the point about him This part of his poetry has been however much to the advantage of poetic form so far as mere surface expression is concerned The crucial significance inherent in his work and the one thing to be mentioned as his chief service to American poetry is the process of elimination he first applied and has continued to apply to the chaos of material brought into notice by Whitman and the in   numerable compilations heaped up by different epochs and periods in continental literature He has been able through all this to clarify the muddy by paths of the mind particularly his mind He is able to juggle as it were the ideas accompanying these paths and at the same time note the resultant significance of each He has been able during the excursion to smile over the irony and the pathetic crumble of each endeavor Such an attitude of course is much too caustic and superior a direction to take against our frail ambitions But the irritation provoked proves without a doubt our inability to indulge in mental combats either at the expense or through the suppression of our feelings A genuine response to the thrust and parry of mental gymnastics will nevertheless eventually arrive among us will no doubt be forced upon us sooner or later when our intellectual conflicts become keener and less detached  It is possible to ask of what direct benefit this can be to American poetry To which I would answer that the gradual infusion of a native intelligence and consciousness in our poetry so promising at the present moment has received more than one impetus from Ezra Pound and that the musty shelves of the past having been unable to choke him as some would like to believe he has helped to bring home the fact that there is an international standard of art as well as the local one which we are inclined to celebrate and that the international is the one with which ultimately we shall have to stand   Ezra Pound Today  The four cantos in this book give me my first chance to draw the line on what is otherwise a most persuasive and enjoyable collection They contain in parts some excellent passages but as a whole their verbosity is too cryptic They give adequately enough the consensus of Pound s mental manoeuverings and they even give his vagrancies in erudition and his antiquarian journeys but they do not sustain the mental affiliations which I find in the other poems They are in his own words  Mouths biting empty air The still stone dogs Caught in metamorphosis were Left him as epilogues  If Pound could be approached though it is quite certain he never will be as an embodiment and manifestation of revolutionary art it might be possible to come to a better understanding of him The refusal in America to distinguish between sentiments of revolution and forces of revolution will hardly permit It is too generally ignored though possibly not fully apprehended that in order to create a disruption there must be some tradition to react on Our traditions are over night traditions platitudes and maudlin satieties When we turn to art and literature these things offer little resistance and our poets have been simply singing their own clear voices under an open sky with no frictional barriers to contend with Pound has fructified this spontaneity with ideas and this comes nearer to a revolutionary force than is at present realized And he has not lost the spirit of dis   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  covery about which there has been much question hurried prophecy and unnecessary lamentation  The influence of this frigid force is not stilled and Poems 1918 21 remains as no other book has done the complete and unalloyed disclosure of Ezra Pound  Virgil Geddes  MAXWELL BODENHEIM MATHEMATICIAN  Introducing Irony A Book of Poetic Short Stories and  Poems by Maxwell Bodenheim Boni amp Liveright  Minna and Myself 1918 was the poised intoxication  of a lover in pursuit of the scented outlines that had intrigued him Advice 1920 was the swift oriental comprehension of one whose fingers had been singed one to whom his emotions had become mistresses slightly passe and who had learned to chide and escape their tyrannies with a deftness that suggested more than the esthetic courtier Introducing Irony 1922 is a book in which new territories of the imagination have been surveyed by an intelligence direct modern and impersonal as a flashlight unhampered by the superstitious glows and half shadows of the lanterns with which contemporary poets still seek their desires  The poems in Introducing Irony meticulous geometric patterns are finely drawn by a hand to which the medium in which it works is only a stimulus It is Bodenheim s unassuming unrelenting search straight and ascetic for outlines that are sweeping in significance   Maxwell Bodenheim Mathematician  because they are not distorted in detail and are freed from realistic or emotional debris that has left an effect of technical brilliance in his poems  His metaphors arise like a subtle giant whose face captures and commands recognition He stands outside the frontiers touched by Pound Eliot and Wyndham Lewis striding across the wilderness they broadly glimpsed with vertiginous and controversial eyes His Sirona in the poem Manners for example has nothing of the caricature that typifies Eliot s Grishkin a portrait done with a sophistication which often passes as satire He brings to a social gathering a whimsical detachment revealing the clumsy subconscious drama of small encounters and from them leaps into that nimbler realism which is known as phantasy  Maxwell Bodenheim is a mathematician of color and sound who turned to words because they are sufficiently fluid and evanescent for his pursuit of skies that vanish before the mechanical glare of logic and the eloquence of orators  So far he has stated his own position more clearly than any of his critics as in the poem An Acrobat A Violinist and a Chambermaid Celebrate fragments of which I quote in their sequence  Men will fail to tell you That an arm rising to the sky Takes a straight line of the soul And tries to comprehend it   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The squares and angles and oblongs of the soul Are pestered by a debris of words Men shoveled away the words Falteringly in youth Tamely and pompously in middle age Vigorously in old age  Nothing is wise except outline  Men with few outlines in their minds Try to give the outlines dignity  Men with many outlines Break them into more and thus Playing come with quickened breath To hints of spiritual contours  Avoid the embryonic yelpings Of argument and scan your patterns For angles and squares and oblongs of the soul  Bodenheim has himself first followed this austere practice He has humiliated nouns and adjectives stripped them of their old despotisms and loyalties of the importance which ages of power as vehicles of broad emotions had given them over the minds of poets and men He has given them the roles of impersonal figures tracing his mathematics of the soul His words are sharp neatly strung with tapping consonants and brief unemotional vowels like the clip of a fatal chisel  In his new book he converses with the fundamental emotions of men and women their defenses and glorifications by poets and philosophers as in Impulsive Dialogue a quarrel between a poet himself and an undertaker his critics In a number of poems he formulates his   Maxwell Bodenheim Mathematician  esthetic intuitions and intentions into clearly defined statements or traps the outlines of faces streets and skies with the wary cunning of one unhampered by allegiance to any philosophic or poetic forms The startled exhilaration with which one greets his phrases is the dazed homage announcing a truly original work and his poems are in the best tradition not because they are rigorously formal and move with effortless precision but because they are new  When in Meditations in a Cemetery he mentions the perturbation of a stone removed from the comprehension of a mountain and branded with the name of A Rosinsky  adding Recollecting journeys of my own I close my eyes and leave the stone it is theoriginal comprehension of the mountain But when he describes a man as which is Manikin at peace With the matchless deceit of a universe he hints at an intimacy with Aristotle and Buddha  This however is a matter for a more extended study of his symbolisms  He eludes the metaphysicians having carved their concepts into minute esthetic curios Metaphysics is a man s choice of his own mise en scene in Bodenheim s poems it is an arctic light in which his brilliant images accept their own insignificance as finalities yet are animated by the macabre elation which has thrown them   into relief Bodenheim says Nothing is wise except outline only because outline traces the path of a search  Emotions and thoughts are merely The improvisations of motion And lack a permanent content  In the ten poetic short stories in this book Bodenheim challenges his contemporaries with a new narrative technique His characters move through his stories with the transparency and speed of ghosts rehearsing memories stripped by time to their intense essentials They improvise for a few moments upon the motif of a significant emotion They have the quality of images in a dream that vanish as soon as they have become manifest They have the hysterical unerring fatality of hallucinations Their effect is that of a clarified Dostoievsky robbed of his ponderous physique The style is a tarantella accompaniment made by consonants linked in an unbroken  rhythm Louis Grudin A TYPE The Shepherd by Edmund Blunden Alfred A Knopf  Edmund Blunden is not a poet for poets or for those laymen who take a poem not as an end but as a point of departure His method follows nature in detail and he is very careful not to miss a single detail with punctilious respect for traditional English metrics This is praiseworthy enough and to those readers of poetry who still prefer itemized conclusions and each hair finely separated   A Type  from its fellow I recommend Edmund Blunden His country pieces are of a certain homely charm lacking in the work of most poets of the same rank a Chaucerian flavor brought about by the use of such uncommon phrases as nid nodding dropples sloven mottle On the black hop pole slats the weazen bine Where merry younkers roach and rudd  His war poems are mostly the usual muddled bombast  Triumph how strange how strong had triumph come On weary hate of foul and endless war  One catches occasional glimpses of a genuine horror but these are too obscured in verbiage to be successful In fact Mr Blunden is wordy throughout thereby losing in unity which should be implicit in a work of art He leaves nothing for the reader but to be happy with a handful of quaint expressions and a bit of English coloring The Poor Man s Pig is as felicitous a poem as any  Already fallen plum bloom stars the green And apple boughs as knarred as old toad s backs Wear their small roses ere a rose is seen The building thrush watches old Job who stacks The bright peeled osiers on the sunny fence The pent sow grunts to hear him stumping by And tries to push the bolt and scamper thence But her ringed snout still keeps her to the sty Then out he lets her run away she snorts In bundling gallop for the cottage door With hungry hubbub begging crusts and orts Then like the whirlwind bumping round once more Nuzzling the dog making the pullets run And sulky as a child when her play s done  Pearl Andelson   ANNOUNCEMENT OF AWARDS  For the tenth time the editors and advisory committee of POETRY assume the agreeable but difficult duty of awarding our annual prizes When the magazine began its campaign for more appreciative recognition of the art prizes for poets were unheard of in this country although almost every large city could show prizes and scholarships endowed in perpetuity for the benefit of painters sculptors architects and musicians The Art Institute of Chicago for example dispenses forty four hundred dollars in prizes each year at its American exhibition nearly three thousand at its Chicago exhibition hundreds at other annual shows and many thousands in scholarships through its school Pittsburgh New York Washington Philadelphia and other cities also show liberal records and the highly endowed American Academy at Rome which should but does not include poets among its beneficiaries gives three year scholarships carrying studio board lodging and a liberal income  From the beginning we have believed in such awards as both a stimulus to artists and a kind of advertisement to the public and have argued that they are as well deserved and as effective for these purposes in poetry as in the other arts We rejoice in many evidences that the tide is beginning to turn and we hope for further proof as time goes on The Dial s initial award of its annual two thousand dollars to Sherwood Anderson is highly   Announcement of Awards  encouraging also the fact that the trustees of the Pulitzer estate have remedied Mr Pulitzer s strange omission by providing an annual thousand for the year s best book of American verse the initial award going to the Collected Poems of Edwin Arlington Robinson and the Poetry Society of America manages to collect five hundred a year for a similar award  These facts are encouraging but we should still remember what a beggarly pittance the poet is supposed to live on Recently in sending a small check to a distinguished poet I reminded him that a portrait painter of his rank would easily receive five thousand dollars for a portrait requiring no more time and thought than his poem He wrote in reply Yes the wages are dire much like those of sin but I don t know just what we are going to do about it  Something should be done about it There should be more foundations of honor and profit for the benefit of poets who at a heavy cost make so much honor and profit for their spiritual constituents of the present and future It may be in order to remind our readers of two plans outlined last year for the information of possible donors and testators Under the first plan the donor aided by the editor of POETRY and other expert advisers would appoint the first committee of award a jury strictly professional consisting of poets only this jury to be self perpetuating through the triennial resignation of one member and election of a new one Under the second   let the presidents of three widely separated institutions say the Universities of California and Illinois and the Poetry Society of America or Harvard the University of Chicago and the Poetry Society of South Carolina or any other representative three let such a group of colleges or societies be requested each year by the custodian of the fund the trust company to appoint each a member of the committee of awards such committee member to be a poet of high repute one not a member of their faculty or board of officers And let this committee bestow the award  Either of these methods would seem to promise as much progressiveness and fluidity and freedom from local prejudice as any artistic endowment in perpetuity can hope for The donor would decide whether his gift or bequest should be used for scholarships that is student awards to young poets or for awards of honor so to speak to poets who have done high service in the art If the award should be generously large the honor would become correspondingly conspicuous and this fact would be a strong influence toward the worthy disposal of it as in the case of the Nobel Prize  We strongly hope that some man or woman of sufficient wealth may be moved to follow this suggestion someone who would like to do something original and constructive and inspiring with his gift or bequest  With this preliminary plea we now proceed to award POETRY S three prizes for poems printed in its pages   Announcement of Awards  during its tenth year October 1921 to September 1922 As usual poems by members of the jury are withdrawn from competition in this case Fire by Eunice Tietjens Song Sketches by Marion Strobel and Supernal Dialogue and Notes of Travel by Harriet Monroe And translations are not considered  We are enabled to continue the Young Poet s Prize this year through the generosity of the Friday Club of Chicago which voted fifty dollars for this purpose last winter and afterwards doubled the appropriation This literary club of women has always been progressive from the time when it undertook to finance the Children s Building at the World s Columbian Exposition We commend this example to other women s literary clubs which devote much time to the works of poets but rarely attempt to pay their debt to them Frances Shaw Mrs Howard Shaw one of the officers of the Friday Club and a poet of distinction becomes a member of the jury for the award of this prize  Trusting that our readers will grant us honesty of judgment even if they disagree with us we now announce the awards for poems published during POETRY S tenth year October 1921 10 September 1922 inclusive  The HELEN HAIRE LEVINSON PRIZE of two hundred dollars for a poem or group of poems by a citizen of the United States is awarded to  ROBERT FROST   of South Shaftsbury Vermont for his poem The Witch of Coos published in the

Bynner and  Kiang Kang hu February  Poems from the Chinese translated by Louise S Ham  mond August  Whenever it is possible we like to reprint the prize poems for the convenience of our readers But this year the poems by Mr Frost and Mr Kreymborg are manifestly too long to be repeated and even Mr Roe s series of sailor poems required six pages and would be injured by the omission of any of its numbers So we shall have to refer our readers to POETRY for January July and June which may still be furnished from this office  NOTES  The first number of POETRY the issue of October 1912 was published September twenty third of that year On the afternoon of Saturday September twenty third 1922 POETRY celebrated its tenth birthday by inviting its guarantors subscribers the poets who have honored its pages and other friends to a party at the new office plus a suite of extra rooms courteously lent by their owner  The program if one may so call it was very informal Poets who happened to be within reach at the season of vagabondage each read one or two of his poems from back numbers of the magazine among them Eunice Tietjens Lew Sarett Edith Wyatt Mark Turbyfill Louise Garnett Laura Sherry Florence Kiper Frank Pearl Andelson and Jun Fujita The editor read some of the most famous poems of POETRY S past such things as Lindsay s General Booth Enters Into Heaven Rupert Brooke s war sonnet The Soldier Joyce Kilmer s Trees Carl Sandburg s Chicago one of Tagore s Gitanjali one or two ot Ezra Pound s   Contemporania some early imagist poems by H D and Richard Aldington and Amy Lowell a few of Edna Millay s Figs from Thistles etc etc time being the only limit to the list Notes and telegrams of congratulation were read from Sara Teasdale Witter Bynner Alice Corbin Louis and Jean Untermeyer Edgar Lee Masters and others  After this hour or more with the poets the party gathered around a prohibition punch fortunately it was a warm day and a marvelous birthday cake presented by one of the magazine s earliest and best friends Mrs William Vaughn Moody a cake two feet in diameter adorned with a garland of sugar roses and leaves and a flutter of sugar ribbons all surrounding an exact confectionery model of the birthday number of POETRY  Among the greetings were many good wishes that the magazine might live through a second decade At least the editor felt that the new period was auspiciously begun  Mr D H Lawrence the distinguished English poet and novelist recently landed in San Francisco from the Orient and is now sojourning in the wilds of New Mexico Beginning thus contrary to the habit of his countrymen with a study of the earliest Americans not to speak of the colonies of artists and poets who rediscovered them some years ago Mr Lawrence will proceed gradually at his pleasure to the highly civilized East stopping at Chicago let us hope as a half way house  Mr Lawrence is the author of a number of novels and books of verse the most recent of the latter being New Poems B W Huebsch  Two other English poets are represented in this number Miss Muriel Stuart author of The Cockpit of Idols Methuen amp Co and Miss V H Friedlaender author of A
