byLANDSCAPE WITH TREESAND COLORED TWILIGHT WITH MUSIC Past the End of the City by Carlos AVKrai THERE is a wide land that is low and flat and has sheets of blue gray water over its outer edges so far from its interiorand often in the great light and heat that come down upon it this land seems bright and shimmeringbut it is a gloomy land like all the othersand some of its parts are more gloomy than others of themAt a certain time in one place in the land a poor city had been madeand there upon the heavy silent grass among wild trees it seemed lonely and pitifulas if the trees and grass were but waiting to creep in nearer and rot it and replace forever its poor dustiness and ferocityThe city had been placed near a small heavy green marsha little below the fieldsthat lay in abundant water with a narrow stream going through itand over the stream from one part of a road to another was an old dust muffled white wooden bridge with a row of shabby gray willows like bunches of worn ostrich plumes at one sideIn the wild fields amid some poor gardens a few dirty houses stoodwith people who were hangers on of the city living in themThis place I saw one hot summer morningIn the city I had thought the gloomy sky was graybut having come out I found it brightwith small vague white cloudsApproaching the place I saw it as from above and far awaybefore a sky bleached by hot sunlightand bleaching all that was before and beneath itan expanse of rough pale fields covered with shaggy grass that was dotted by the black shrubs of thorn appleSome delicate rectangles of blue forest oak lay in a few placesdark lone oaks and elms stood in the white green fieldsand along narrow white dusty roads were short rows of black poplar treesAt the foot of a slope the marsh waved gently like a grainfieldwith the heat and light making it at times almost invisibleAnd in this powerful soft and white hot light I strolledexamining the bunches of pale green apples on the apple shrubsplucking dried brown tops of cloverlooking with pleasure at a tousled grassy nook in a bank under a wide low treeAnd I wenton a path in a bank that stood above the road along the front of one of the dark cool oak woodswhich made the road here damp and blackdown upon the bridgethence to see the marshclear brown water whichas the sunlight struck it off in certain placeswas blue and hot like the sky and which under the reeds was clear green in odd streaks and circlesclumps of green reeds three meters tallbroad flagsweeds with heads like spearslily leaves in the open waterand little balls of floating scumI strolled and frequently looked back and about to see allthe lighted hot silver skythe grassmost lacking in strength of all the greenfor it was already in seed and full of mustard in profuse yellow bloomthe gray little willows and pale marshthe lone treesthe dark forest squaresand the blackblack poplarsAnd the poplars made one watch them carefullysmall trees on that great lighted plainbut twenty meters tall close bythick high treesthe branches growing low on the straight trunksthe grass and weeds high aboutand the wind constantly turning up the light under sides of the tough round little leavesor opening places in the dark mass to let the strangely lighted sky shine IhroughThe trees seemed to sparkleAnd with their surface leaves a flutter and their heavy interiors still they were strong and bouyantand they made the light about and beneath them green and green whiteand the noise of them up in the free airs was loud and authoritativeSo the place on a hot summer morning with birds chattering in the woods and marsh and all scents faint in the dry heat and lightBut on a chilly damp evening I saw that place againand it was strongcolouredand even vast and sublimeI moved that night on roads laid as about a trianglethroughacrossand back from that regionand twice over its streamby the white bridge and another distant oneFirstin the silence the light was fadingThe sky of afternoon became strangeunrealand softpalepalerpale bluemilky greenand the white cloudsof which it held manywere drawn out into shreds or flutedone round cloud was like the head of a Greek statue of a mana pure white cloud lighted at the top with goldIt grew darkerThen the great sky above and in the west beyond the clouds became dark clear pinkalmost purplethe clouds soft rosy pinkin the north the sky remained clear green and the clouds there were long faint streaks of brown and amberThe dark green and purpling world beneath contracted and grew strongand yet was vastervasterall objects were of newsurprisingdense substancethe darkened east and the whole air became deep purplelike the purpie of grapesand denser and more fragrantit seemed as if the whole airheavy with scentwas composed of masses of particles of liquid or glass that reflected the differently colored lightspinkand greenand deepening purple from the sky and the darkening earthGreat round purple and green earth under the vast purple and pink and greenish curve of the skyThe grassfull of redpink and white cloverbesides the mustardthe poor tall milkweedburdockand pink and purple thistlesgave perfume that was well nigh overpoweringand I smelled the strong odor out of a little cowstableAnd all was strangeOff in the purple and pink gloom where were the gardens and the cabbage fieldssome poor people still workedfar back across the fields some small birds flew off somberly in a low lineThe little woods had become so denseblue and blackthat they surprised and seemed to menacethe poplars were heavy and blackno light went through them nowand on a wallow bough that had been broken down the fine dead gray leaves were rustling as I crossed the bridgeAmong the wretched houses that stood upon the fields was a narrow ugly cottage painted drab and become almost black through neglectA front corner whereat was a porch had sunk down into the groundand high rank grassdandelionsand other weeds grew close about the low buildingrotting itThe house stood closebeneath one row of the high dark poplar branchesAwaybut the only one at all nearwas a much largertallerand even more gloomy housewith shuttered windowsin a wide yard with old lilac trees full of sprouts and some grass through which dirty chickens walked silentlyand the yard was enclosed by palings of broken lath_ A family once lived in the cottagea silent manpast thirtywith a dark skina heavy soft bodyand a limp thick mustache that hung downwhen he was about his home the man wore a faint shame faced leerand he was thoroughly indifferent to everything therethough he could beat a child long and cruellya man of only those few poor qualities and desires which fools like him considered to be for menThe woman was tallthinyounger somewhat than tiewith faded yellow hairthin tough gray skinand cheeks much narrower than her foreheadwith a slight flush high on themShe liked idleness and comfortand being dallied with by menwhen she had been younger her slenderessand a certain slowness and awkwardness she hadroused some desirebut she was of a poor spiritdared to do only what was customaryand she had not much used herselfnow that she was older she had become only procras tinative and given to dull meditation and occasionally to sharp irritationShe even exhibited an interest in the few objects and perThe Little Review 7 sons about her and the few acts possible to heran interest which was acquired but which resembled the garrulous interest of other women who lived as sheShe was uncouth and repulsivebut even yet enough of a womanAnd though she did not know how to work well and could not learnshe worked constantlyOf the two children born of her one was still not a year olda helplessdroolingnoseless infantthe other was three years olda dark sneakingwhiningboy with short dark hair all over his headclothed in a dress of red cotton plaid and white drawers and body garment beneathThis boy could wander back across the weedy fields and play in the litter of the brookbeside the bridge in the green light under the willowsAccording to the style of the time the woman herself wore ugly cotton gowns with yokesstrapsand flouncesmore cotton cloth beneathhigh stained gray corsets round her pale stooped bodyand heavy leather shoes fastened with buttonsHer weak hair was in a large loose ball at the top of her forehead and in a knot behindAnd what a peopleWhat a timeTheirs was a race dimcoldand tenuous of feelingyet at times prevaded by a curious bright lighta race of great passionless strengthand a wild indestructible faithor fixity of willa race that loves a littlecuriouslywith shameand that is indifferent to all but certain elemental thingsIt was a time when that race was far in the rearbut hadperhaps in defencea vanity and self admiration giganticWith their hearts protected against all that they had not yet attainedas their bodies were concealed in clothesmercilessly hostile to all that they did not undestandthey were a people to dreadBut such as these in the cottage on the fields one could lovefor they were of the poorthe weakthe outcastand the oppressed of the othersIn the morning very earlyas he had returned silent and sour with sweat late in the night beforein the morning when it was lightbut when the coloursthe grays and greenswere repulsive and the air foggy and coldthe man with food in a newspaper wrapper went quickly and silently away toward the cityand he seemed very tiny as he moved over the foggy fields sucking the smoke from a cigarUnder his jacket he wore tight on his softish body a faded black cotton shirtand on his head a serge cap with a shining forepiece like a naval officer sThe woman began at once to workNear the rotten wooden steps at the back of the cottage in the cold fog she began to wash clothes in tubs on an unfolded trestleA cloth bag of wooden clipsa swab with stiff dirty clothsand a broom hung on the outer house wallIn gray smoking soapy water she washed the clothesrub bing them on a board ridged with zincwashed the filthy clothesher calicothe shirts and drawersnarrow stockingssheets from the bedsthe clouts of the babyShe pumped the water and carried it herselfsilentlybending her tall thin bodystraining and working it past all reserveit and her thin arms with sharp yellow elbowsShe hung the clothes on blackened ropes stretched between some old shedsouthousesand slanted postsshe too was tiny there on the great dim fieldsAt first she wet her feet in the sop like grasswet almost to the knee her cotton skirts and her long ugly white legs in loose cotton stockings gartered above the knee with shoe latchand she shuddered with the coldThen as the sun rose higher and it became hot she sweated and pantedIn the first of the morning the light was golden on the green fields and marshbut it became ever more silverTwo hours after she had begun to work her oldest child appeared to her in the kitchen doorway in its old sleeping dresswhining and sniffling with the morning chill and the confusion of being just awakeand twisting and rubbing on the side of the doorframe for its fear at interrupting herShe looked at it with no sort of kindness or welcomeand with impatience warned it not to wake the otherThen she continued her workBut on his snuffling plaintively that he was coldshe finished and wrung the cloth she heldand half drying her hands and arms on the sodden apron over her front she wentbent from the rubbingup the steps and in at the door guiding and pushing the child back into the kitchen before herHandling him partly as if he were another grown person and partly as if he were some wooden instrument with which she had not had practice and in whose use she felt little interestshe got him into clothesShe sat in a low bottomed chair and held and turned him before herShe washed his face with a rag that smelled as if it were rotton and combed his hair with a comb full of head grease that smelled bitterWhile being dressed the child wept and snivelled in fear and uncertaintyshe sometimes ignored himsometimes scolded himsometimes berated him as if he were an adult enemybut sometimes she looked upon him as if in consternation and dreadThen at the table she fed him coffee with milk and sugar and with wafers soaked in itWhile this child was taking its food she walked guardedly into the bedroom to look at the otherand having found it awakeapparently to her annoyanceshe uncovered it in her awkward hasty irritated waytook it updressed it in a blue shift and diaperand then gave it one of her limp livid breastsTo this child s dress she added a boiled bonnet and a shawland she fastened it into a small woven chair with a hole in the seat and a rimmed shelf before and bore it out beside the washing tubsShe had now to take the first childimportuningto the outhousealready buzzing with fliesShe too sat downThen she began to work againand she continued until all the clothes were washed and hung on the linesIt was then not much short of noonThere on the great shaggy empty fields under the sunlit and sun washed skyto the noise of the black poplars and the air over the fields she lived and workedShe would have been perplexed at being watched or thought ofthat would have been incomprehensibledisjtastefulcoldly and cruelly resented and despisedShe prepared to eatThe heat was making the small rooms suffocating even where there was a draughtShe sat at the side of the weak oval wooden table in the kitchenbetween it and the wallthe baby at her left in a high chairthe other child far around at the right out of her reachsitting forward on its chairwhich was too far from the tablehalf drinkinghalf spooning its food into its mouthseriously absorbed with the food and pleased with itbut watchful and afraid of herShe herself ate much in a carelesssmearing wayShe ate a heap of chopped boiled potatoes reheated but not browneddead whitesome thick greasy meat sauce warmedand some stewed rhubarb that she had saved in a dishand she drank much coffee with milk listlessly out of a large white cupSprawling sidewise in her chair she watched the children carelesslyonce she got up to jerk the older child closer to the tableand once she leaned forward to pull his food away when in repletion he complained of itThe bedroombeside the room in front of the kitchenwas stiflingodoured of the tumbled bedclothesalmost intolerable wrhen she went in there to arrange the bedsHaving again taken the oldest child to the outhouse and having replaced the soaked and yellowed clouts of the baby laid upon her knees with its bent legs in the airand again given it her breastshe put aside the dishes from which they had eaten and the frying pan and coffee potand dragged out from a dark place under a shelf a deep basket of red berries covered with a carpetand began to pinch off the stemstake out the many that were decayedand to washsugarcookand seal the rest into cvlindrical flawed glass jarsfor preservation till winterIn the stifling bare rotting kitchen with a fire of wood going hotly in the stove to boil the fruit she did this worksitting for long periods that made the back ache over the stemmingwiping away

played there in the water in the softened light under the willowsbroke the jar upon a stone among the gray litterand cut the inside of the lower part of its thumb on an edge of the heavy glassThe pale greenish glass was dark clear green along the broken edgeBack came the child up the bankalong the roadand across the fields crying in perplexity and fear in the heatand smearing itself with the startling welling dark bloodConfusedimpotentand terrified lest the blame be upon herthe woman received the childthen she became fierce and wrathfulbut her excitement quickly subsided and was replaced by nervous weaknessshe did not even finish fastening the bandage wellbut wound it carelessly round the hand and told the child to goWith the clumsy bandage the child was fretfulWeakened and quieterbecoming more wearythe woman worked through the afternoon which was passing from the earthboiled the fruitwent here and therechanged the baby s cloutssuckled itwiped its spittleAs she weariedshe would sometimes stop aimlessly before the infant when it criedand remain standing with her poor weakened and sweated body sagging forward at the waisther high corsets thrusting up before and behind as if to plane off her head and leave it but a plug upon her shouldersand partly looking away she would follow the baby s attempt to put something into its mouthIf it seemed about to fail she would put out her hand to assistbut she would drop the hand at once if the baby succeeded aloneWhen she had finished with the fruit the washed clothes were drythese she took downdragged in in a broken basketdampened carelesslyand foldedShe no longer spokeThe hours passedThe little lonely cottage under the vast bright sky endured for those hoursThe gloomy earth with its green trees enduredThe poplars clattered their thick leather leaves in the windthe marsh and the willows rustledAll enduredNothing went past on the poor roadThe light weakened slowlyAt last it began to be that twilight of the wide pale green sky with white clouds lighted with goldFinally it became the twilight of vastnesspink and purpledense airand heavy scentsSilentlystifflyand slowly the mother fedher children for the last time that dayate something herself aimlessly and languidlyarranged for the man s stronger food laterand then prepared the children for the bedwashing the larger child s stained dusty feet and wrapping again the cut handCarryingthe night dressed infant on one arm over her sagging shoulder and pushing the other by the headwhich pressed back against her legsshe took them through the darkening

small bed for the childa large high wooden one for the resta stand of drawersa poor glassand on the wooden floor lay a bit of ragged carpetand the bedsfor the hot weatherwere almost without anything but the dirty hard red mattresses and sheetsShe placed the infantalready asleepon the large bedthe other child in its torn sleeping dress she put into its own bedand she went out to the other roomThe cut child was feverish because of its woundbut it began to sleep after rolling about for a littleThe larger room where the woman now sat was bare alsothe floor was dirty and entirely uncoveredthe broken torn divan stood against the wallthere was a tablealso against the walltwo rocking chairs and another chaira shelf with a stopped black clock upon it and a stack of newspapers about to slip downsome crooked dusty curtains at the windowsthere was little elseAt the left of the front wall was a double door frame through which to go into the darkening front room with the crooked window and the colored glassesThis room was perfectly emptyThe woman sat by a double window at the right near an outer door to the porchthe door was open and had a sagging screen of wood and rusted metalHere there was airand above and about the porch were the thick darkening gloomy poplar branchesIt was almost as if one were in the branchesShe had sunk down into a sort of child s woven chair that had once been painted whiteand she sat stiffly with her chin upon her handsidewise in the chairShe sat in the green and gray of the coming gloomBeside her on the floor was a broken paper box containing clothes to mendand she bent downdrew up one of the man s black shirts by a cornerglanced at itthen let it fall listlessly once more she sat stillsat in the poor dirty room full of twilight subduedand coloured still more than withoutby the heavy green treesAnd to her this landthe city not far offthe househerselfher clothesher few absurdcloudy but hard thoughtsbeliefsand purposes were not strangenor was there in all thingsin the world and skyin that of herself which was fellow to all human beings of all timesanything strange or appallingmoving evenFor in herself was little to createor to seethese qualitiesShe was so weary that her body was weak and numb and extremely sensitiveshe felt distinctly her headbreasts against the corsetsbackaching legsand feetthisand but little elsewas all that she feltSo she satand it grew darker and gloomierand she remained there without movingAt lastwhen it was much laterall at onceas has happened how many timessomeone in that other house away upon the darkened fields started musicfaint for the distancefrom a piano perhapsor some mechanical devicewierd musicwith high chordsand it was music which in that strange placein the deepening gloomwith the trees rustlingwas strangely firm and had authority and strengthand over the dew wet grass and the weeds of the fields and through the pink and deep purple light and the quivering green trees it came into that room as if destined so to comeIt seemed that it came through the dense dark but coloured and wet air in great slowly made curves and bows that were almost circlesand that each note had power to go down deep into the heartthe breastand to find there large decayed round spots and to draw from those spots slow terrible powerful notes of sympathy to mingle with the othersThis music continuedLeaning forward of a suddenboth elbows on her kneeswhich were close togethertoes turned inand her open hands covering her facethe woman began to weepShe made great sobs with long pauses betweenShe sobbed slowly and somewhat as if without feelingand yet there was something like the violent retching of one poisoned in those sobsShe sobbed a long timeThen she became quieter and quieterand at last began to have doneThe heavy poplar trees rattled in the gloomy darkThere began to be greater coldWhat dim light had been left in the room gave place to complete cold heavy darknessThere was darkness over the worldThe armsthe hands still over the facedropped forwardthe head with its limp weak hair sank downthe face sliding along the bare thin armsfirst on the undersidethen as the arms turned overon the backand thenarms outhands hanging limply at the wristsshe sleptbent almost doubleIn the chilly black empty room of that cottage out upon the wide terrible fieldsamong the treesby the heavy high poplar trees that were always movingshe slept with haggard cheeksThe children lay on the beds in the other dark chamberthe larger breathing and turning uneasily for its wound and for the cold so that it could be heardThe cold increasedThe music continued for a timethen ceasedthe dark seemed to become more murkythe poor leaves rustled in the winds that came and went out of and into the unlighted skyPOEMS by Robert Reiss Paint These are the attempted deeologues To remurmur old sentimentalitiesForget the dull and overharsh moments In remembrance of a

porcelain Moulded in the old designYou have sat too long With the berry eyed ladies A NEW TESTAMENT by Sherwood Anderson IV WHEN I stop stretching my mind it slips back and lies dead and lifeless like the rubber band of a boy s slingshotFor hours and days it lies dead and meaningless like a wornout shoe thrown into an alleyway in a cityA dirty boy with a twisted shoulder has thrown me ov r a fence and I fall rattling on stone steps at the back of a house where lives a woman whose lover I once wasOnce I kissed the woman when we had both been drinking wineIt was late at night and there was snow on the groundHer cheeks were cold but her lips were warmHer father owned a factory where shoes are madeThe father of the crippled boy worked at a bench in the factoryEverything I have found out about life is common knowledgeThe dogs in the street bark my knowledge in the dark nightsTwo cats live in an alleyway back of a gloomy building where I have a hole in which to sleep and where for long hours I lie awakethinkingdreamingputting up my hands in the darknesswhispering your name and the names of other beautiful things I have seenThis is in the deep quiet of the night when you have passed into a dreamless sleepThis is when the smoke of the city has been blown awayThe wind has lifted the smoke off the city as an old factory hand homeward bound on a winter evening might lift a dirty carpet off the form of a dead child he has found lying in an alleywayAt two o clock at night a steamboat whistle blows in the Chicago RiverA man who lives above me gets out of bed and goes barefooted across the floorHis feet fall on the boards like the fingers of a player on a silent piano filled with broken stringsHe strikes a matchI know what he is doingHe is lighting a candle in order that God may see into his room and remember him in the time of his deathI do not arise and light a candle for the sake of GodI lie still and thinkGod has multiplied himself so often in my sight that I cannot see him by the light of a candlev Long ago an old man sat on a log at the edge of a cornfield and talked to me of GodHis words leaked awayThey would not stay in my headThe rustling of the leaves of a tree near at hand drowned his voiceIt ran the scale like the voice of an OrientalThe little drums in my ears were tickled by rising and diminishing waves of soundHis words ran into the rows of corn and became rows of soundsan army of soundsThey hopped and ran like little naked childrenHe did not teach me much of God but fragments of God s truth clung to meIt fell on me like drops of warm rain out of a wet skyDid I not learn from him that words are livingbreathing thingsThey are the children of men that have been put to work in a factoryTheir little bodies have become bent and stooped and twistedThe female words have found no loversThey are barrenIt was not God s wish that it be soI am one who would serve GodHave not my brothers the male words been castrated and made into eunuchsI would be nurse to many distorted wordsI would make my book a hospital for crippled wordsFrom this day I shall wear a white garment and deny myself the pleasures of the bodyThe words of old time men have been reborn in the factory towns of my countryThey are choked with smoke and drowned in waves of new soundsWill you give a wordnourishing foodcarry him for a day in the warm body of yourself as a maid carries with due modesty a babe in her bellyIt is time for the old men to come back out of their sleeping stuporThy must sit again at the edge of the cornfieldsThe words of our lips are being destroyedThey are undernourished and work in the factoriesThere is a tough gnarled new word that has lived for a long time in a corner of my brainHe has set up an insanity thereSometimes for days I do not dare go near the corner of myself where the word sits crouchedready to striketo springI start to walk boldly in at the door of my house and then grow afraid and run awayI run out of the present and into the pastI run past clanging factory townspast long bridgesover lakes and seasinto the desertsinto the forestsIt is by chance that I recover and come back into myselfA twisted word seeks warmth in a corner of my brainHis body is bent and his lips twitchSomething tells me he is the son of an old sweet word born on a hillside long ago in the nightThey have brought the little twisted word into the WestIn the service in which they put him the air was badThe flying end of a broken wheel hit him and broke his backHis body twitches when he breathsHe lives but the air whines and whistles as it works its way through his lungsHe has escaped from his servitude and has got into my brainMy twisted word will live long enough to breed and to perpetuate his kindBring me quickly the female words that are barren and waitingIf you do not hurry my twisted word will die in the corner of my brainI am a breeding place for a twisted wordI await the time of the breeding to be

his teethhe leaned over he washing bowl and a moment later let the red mush escape his lipsIt fell with a little splash into the shallow dirty water in the basinthen wound itself into a spiralsuch as one sees on the scummy surface of a lake after a bather has plunged or in pictures of new worlds in formation as nebulaeThe convolutions of the spiral seemed to have wound themselves round him in some sinister wayfor every night he repeated the same experimentleaning over the basin in tense anxiety lest perhaps this once the spiral should not materializeIt never did fail him howeverand the little red whorlopening wider after a momentbecame an obsessionfor though it had no area yet it seemed to cut a hole throu n the centre of the water in the bowl and beyond that through the washstandstraight into the middle of the earthIt was like a red sinister eye suddenly opening on him from the hot and throbbing centre of the earthand the whorl it made was an eternal shapeHe alone had brought it into being by breathing on the waterObviously he was GodThen the red spiral became the blood of a sacrificepumped out before him by a heart torn smoking from the victim s breastIt jerked out its life blood before himspasmodicallylike a curious machineStaring down on the basinhis thoughts became fixed and immaculate All movement stopped in his brain and the candle at his side flickered slowly downAfter a while a subtle rapport established itself between him and the spiral of tooth paste and saliva spat into the basinIfas occasionally happenedhe was too tired to clean his teeth before bed it was as though the tribute which was due from some subject race to his godhead had not been sent and was therefore a direct challenge to his overlordshipDropping to sleephe would be overtaken by restless and unrefreshing dreamsHe saw himself a colossal figure of vengeance Cyclopean with one red spiral burning eye and his tooth brush brandished above his headHis toothbrush had become amaquahuitland the bristless sharp obsidian flakesAll the night he sought his enemiesin the air in subterranean corridorsand under the earththrough forestsround precipicesbut they always eluded himAfter a whileby simply gazing at the spiral as he stood uphe could metamorphose himself into the god of his dreamsNeedless to say it affected his work at the bankfor the next day his fellow clerks would ask if he had had athick night When he remembered himself towering ten feet high in his dreamwhirling the maquahuitlscouring the earth in search of hidden enemiesa sour taste would come into his mouth as he looked aroundsaw the ledger before himthe grill a little way offHis colleaguesbland and intentfilled him with angerThey did not know with whom they were dealingThey did not know he was a godthat warm scummy jumping hearts were torn out of their breasts to be offered to him and that he was powerful to wreak vengeanceHe went surlily to his ledger and bending over it began to balance it automaticallyAfter a while he did not even pretend to be workingbut would put his elbows on the desk and his head on his hands and imagine he was far away a stalwart ten foot figure crushing through the undergrowthscattering his enemies before him like antsin his right hand the maquahuitl edged with obsidianwhirling terribly about his headAt such moments bis breath would acceleratea red flush dye his cheeks and a fierce light come into his eyesOne evening in the middle of a similar exaltationhe picked up the ledger as one might a slave and dashing it down thought to brain itIt was after closing time in the bankbut the crash made them all jumpThe manager sent for himwarned himHe did not know what the manager was sayingthe words seemed puerile and without contextHe contented himself with smiling vaguelyfumbling at a coat buttonThe manager waited for a replyBut no reply was given and before the inanity of his clerk s stare and a something sinister behindhe grew uneasy and said he might go backUpon the third repetition it was heardthe inane smile left the face and he went back to his deskAnd always the haze surrounding him grew deeper and it became purely an automatic series of movements that carried him to his bank in the morningaway in the evening and through its routine in the dayNowadays once he had got home and eaten his dinnerhe shut himself in his room on the pretext

aguavesyuccas and cactistumbling over the roots of treesamong pinesoaks and chestnutshe would pursue his scattering enemiesThis was what he lived for this was why he hurried home from the bank every evening and never went outAt this time the Wilkin KBright Companywith central offices in Chicagodecided to begin a terrific publicity campaign that could not fail to set the world agogThis campaign was for nothing less than a new tooth paste with a chlorine baseOne of the advertisements ran like this Why have white shining teethIt is tempting providenceGood teeth are bornnot madeTry our Chlorax gives the latest society gold tint By means of such advertisementsaccompanied by charming photographs of Angel Cooper showing her teeth the new tint and extensively spread over five continentsthe new powder achieved an instant and remarkable successOne day Smiththe bank dandyappeared with golden teethThe effect was so arresting that the very next day the whole of the junior staff appeared with their teeth the same tint to the great scandal of the conservative headsOur hero was set to thinkingGoing homehe too bought a box of the powder with its guarantee of money returned if it did not do all that was claimed for itAfter dinneras was his customhe went up to his bedroom and cleaned his teethThe powder was yellowbut this did not strike him as strange and when he let the mush fall from his lips it fell with a splash and was lost to view in the dirty water of the bowlHe stared into the basinwaiting waitingbut he hardly knew for whatAfter a few minuteshe shook himselfwondering what on earth he waited forthen went downstairs againThe familysurprised to see him again as he always shut himself up at that hourand excited by the new colour of his teethcrowded round himragging himThis made him forget the obscure uneasiness which floated at the back of his brainLooking at the clock and finding it eighthe was alarmed by the prospect of a blank eveningbut going out wandered distraught for an hourHe then returnedwent straight to his room againcleaned his teethalways expecting whatThen he went to bedHis sleep was disturbed by terrible dreamsin which he chased his enemies through a thousand perils but always without successHe awoke in the morning desperately tiredSo for a weekHe could not tell what was wrong with himHis evenings were beyond words desolateAt eight he was donenothing to do nowhere to goHe fell desperately illhovered for a time between life and deathand during his fevers frightened his nurse with the blood thirstiness of his criesthe horrible and circumstantial accounts of tvhat he had done to his prisonersFinally he grew well and forget he had ever had these hallucinationsbut with this forgetfulness the Wilkin KBright Corn pan was deprived of

Board The Art of MadnessI LET me hasten to aidjhin relieving the readers of the Little Reviezvof the awful misapprehension that she and I agreeTo come to a unanimous conclusion in any discussion it is necessary that the parties to it begin with a common understanding of the word values employed by eachOtherwise each argues in his own tongue and there is no hope of bridging their disagreementI fear this is the present caseArt tojh for instanceappears to be something too sacred for analysiselse why should she be shocked by a recognition of the fact that the psychological idiosyn cricies inate in the artist and so beyond the despotism of will modify and distinguish the quality of his work In the case of Else von Freytag Loringhoven I am not talking of mania and diseaseof numbed sensibilitieshers is a willed state saysjh I concede it to be true that in no effort in which self consciousness of any sort persists is the will absolutely in abeyanceand the beginning of madness is rarely an absolute stateTo express life in words is to juggle with the poison that lies in the very mediumfor language was primarily an attempt to arrest experience and so enslave life and do it to death that man might nomore fear itThe artist often courts the speech of the madman because he desires the emotion he has ensnared to escape the petrification of intellectualizationbut there is a point at which the will weakens beneath the onrush of forces it has itself loosedAmidst flashes of insight like fire in the rain perception dims and is finally extinguished in the blindness of pure sensationElse von Freytag Loringhovenin my opinionhas walked perilously nearif she has not passed over the edgebeyond which the vision of delirium melts into the blank self enwrapped exaltation of tranceMargaret Anderson is good enough to inform me that through the carelessness of the printerjhwas misquoted in her reply to me in the last issueso thatworkingshould be supplemented forevoking in which case I quotejhas follows The artist working his consciousness at a high power on some piece of difficult work appears to have become callous and stupid or a wild man to the layman For the sake ofjhI am sorry that the correction must be madeas by this alteration in her statement a word of vague applicability is supplemented for one of clear connotationOne must now inquire in what manner and under what circumstances the artist is able toworkhis consciousnessA man may be working a sewing machine or a plow orin the vernacular of the dayhe may be working a womanIn each case an initiation of will is requiredThe point at issue is to decide wherein lies the difference in the relation which the man holds to the sewing machine and the plowand to the womanIn one case we have the will acting without limitations other than those which inhere in the quality of metalThe man may mar the machine and destroy the plow and even then he can collect the mutilated parts and reconstruct them to their original useBut over the woman he has not an equal sphere of dominanceBy suggestions of fear or benevolence he may temporarily put one or more of her powers at his disposalbut she will continue to exist under her own condition which he has not created and cannot re createIt would seem that only in this sense can the consciousness beworked for it is distinguishable from the will while existing on unalterable termsOne bends to one s uses the thing one can not break and the most literal word to express this act is the word whichjh unfortunatelydid not useevocationI did not anywhere make a statement which would contradict the supposition that the madness of the artist in question was evoked as is often the madness of the religious ecstaticonly that the features of madness were in her workSynthesis looses the willOne may evoke a goda museor a madnessbut to speak of conditioned disorder would be to contradict oneselfand I certainly believe that Else von Freytag Loringhoven is powerless to condition the disorder she has evokedEVELYN SCOTTII IT does not seem necessary to flaunt and flourish as much as Miss Scott does in such a simple discussionThis is no controversyThere is no need of agreement or unanimous conclusion in any discussion or argumentand when two such different minds meet there is not even the possibility of a common understanding of word valuesword values come from personal values Art to jh appears to be something too sacred for analysist fear not sacred enoughI write more about Art than anyone in the countrywasting time and energy that might be put into my proper work as an artist It is all too foolishThe Baroness von Freytag will think us feeble mindedBut now let us see who is talking about whatIt all started from a statement of mineNo one has yet done much about the Art of Madness Then Miss Scott jumped in and talked about the madness in the Art of von Freytag not the Art in her MadnessI never thought of discussing those psychological peculiarities in the artist which are beyond the reach of the willHaven t those things been recognized and summed up even by the laymen inartists are born not made Words do not mean so many things to me as they do to Miss ScottConsciousness does not mean the sum of ungovernabledispersed facultiesConsciousness means complete beingSo I am not talking of a state in which the consciousness is only kept from being nothing by a weak and tottering willbut of one in which the will is so powerful that it creates the being the state of consciousness it desiresWhen I speak of disease I mean disorderWhen a person has created a state of consciousness which is madness and adjustsdesigns and executesevery form and aspect of her life to fit this state there is no disorder anywhere there is therefore no diseaseThere can be no legitimate standard for valuing the order of sanity higher than the order of madnessexcept a moral oneNow I will try to answer Miss Scott s problem of working and evokingI did not use the word evoke because it is an unknown and unnecessary word to meEvoking comes in the class with rain makingetcIf one has the power to evoke he has more power than the evokedIt is perhaps not necessary for theartist to make any outward sign that he has had his specialized creative experiencebut it is customary and human and we are speaking of these signsworks of art After the aesthetic intuition of Beauty there is a simultaneous mental and emotional conception the complete vision and creation of this beauty the internal expression the experience of the creative impulseBut if the artist wishes to show other men that he has had this experiencefirst he willsintends unconditionallythenhe must not choose with his mind but with his consciousness the subject matter which will best communicate his experienceand then by deliberate and intense activity of his consciousness he must produce the formscoloursrhythm of his inventionMiss Scott has informationknowledge and wordsAll that she says is true but it does not make sense because it does not fit this discussionUnless I had tried to begin my discussion far beyond the cause which may be pathological and the effect which is not beyond the support of knowledge and evidence and academic definitionI should feel that I had offered an affront and an insult to Else von Freytag LoringhovenjhIlljhunderstands me wonderfully perfectlyDon t I say inThe Cast Iron Lover look full of laughter look full of motionlook full of dizzinessinsanitywhich makes steady and sane maketh steady and sane thine body Is it not necessary for emotions to come out is it not necessary for emotional people to be like insane sometimesto be more sane and steady and strong than othersweaker peopleafter thatIs it not wonderful to be able to control that thenthat emotionwhich otherwise would throttle youbut take it by the neck and make Art out of itand be freethat isthe masterOnly such things done that way are ArtIt is Goethe s artHe knew that too he too had to do it Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt weiss was ich leide That is just as insane as myCast Iron Lover and would have been too sentimental if Goethe had not been such a strong artist and myCast Iron Loveris not an iota more insane nor less artPerhaps the America people need to be told it Europeans wouldn tno people who read books like the Little ReviewAnother thinghaven t all higheultured emotional people which always means artistic peopleas high culture is only possible with emotional peopletherefore Americans can never have it and the Germans will I mean high culture that what the French can t hold any longer for their blood has become thin the teutons will take it and flow it with bloodstrength tell the Americans that in nations of high culture it even was a public customas it is still for instance in the mardi gras orFaschingand in old Greece in the feast of Dionysus die Dionysienas we learned it in Germany and always will be because it has to be like a steam nozzle on a tea kettleto be insanefor a timeto be very sane and steady and strong and relieved after itBecause Americans do not need that they should not give costume ballsThey do not know what it is for the reason for them to let yourself go That is why it is such a mournful heartbreaking affair in AmericaEuropeans like myself cannot understand why they put on these costumes they are silly enough without inner sensebut why they do it anyway and stay up all night and move around when they are not different as if they were in their beds so why not rather go to bed instead of giving this mournful spectacle of intended gaietywhen there is no gaiety to be relievedor insanityor anything to toe let golet looseIt is all a make believeEverything emotional in America becomes a mere show and make toelieveNo necessity no blood behindThey their needs did not create itThey monkeyed it after Europe as they do everything except businessevenmarriage and it is just such an empty show at make believewithout anything to let go let looseThey have not found out the sense and never willThey ought not to marry they ought not to make love to shame the word even how much more the sense and the actionAmericans are trained to invest moneyare said to take even desperate chances on thatyet never do they invest beauty nor take desperate chances on thatWith money they try to buy beautyafter it has died famishingwith grimaceBeautv is ever dead in America ELSE von FREYTAG LORINGHOVENThe December Number I thought the November issue the best yetbut here is the December one with

hisParcel of Loveachieved an interesting failureAnd his failure was due to the fact that he tried to do by means of condensation what he should have done by connotationAnd thatby the wayseems to me at bottom what is wrong with so much of the new poetryHaving been born in Russia and of Jewish parentsI am quite naturally more American than the Americansthat will explain to you my profound interest in Sherwood AndersonAmerican writers are of two sortsthere are those who have been taught at college how to writeand sonaturallythey can writeAndthey do wirdteThey are the Authors Who Never Go Wrong1 don t know whether Professor Pitkin of Columbia gives a guarantee with his coursebut he well mightWithout a doubt he has yet to turn out his first failureand as for his successful authorsthey are all over our magazinesThese are the authors who are all dressed up with no place to goexcept into our magazinesThen there is the other sortthe merest handfulDreiserAndersonMarksauthor ofPeter Middletonand wellnever mindI can t recall the rest of them just at this momentIt seemed never to have occured to them that writing is something that has to be learntSomething was troubling them on the insidewriting seemed a promising way to get rid of itand so they sat down and wroteSometimes they had to go on until they had written volumesThese volumes were later called novels by publishers and reviewersand so they became novelists When they produced lesser volumesthey were called short story writersplaywrightspoetsIn all these instancesthese writers had reversed our present educational methodsOur present method of education is to furnish one with an equipment for possible needsthe nature of these possible needs is arrived at by more or less shrewd guessing and the law of averagesAndin order to insure against fatalitieswe do what the pharmacist does when he is unable to read the prescriptionhe makes the concoction harmlessThe resultif a human society is to be judged by the amount of its chatelsthe result has thus far been quite satisfactoryTo the holders and beneficiaries and their assignsThese writershaving missed the benefits of a course under Professor Pitkin of Columbia or Professor Baker of Harvardbegan with needs but without equipmentand so they were forced in their need to lay hands on the things within reachpiece by piecealways under great stressAt the present momenttheir equipment bears a striking resemblance to the furnishings found in a Greenwich Village studiosometimes there are too mny chairs and no tablesat other times too many tables and no chairsyou may find dozens of plates and not a single cupor priceless china and woolworth knives and forksand in nearly all instancesthe lack of form is more than made up by a riot of colorAnd this brings me to Djuna Barnes32 The Little Review Djuna Barnes is a great potentialShe has the native predilections of a poetHer treasury of merit is rich and interestingButI am surethat with her it is always a toss upWill shewon t sheYou will recall how I praised herA Night Among The Horses But it is not to her credit at all that she gives me the feeling of a lucky accidentHerThree From The Earthis a might have beenIf she weren t quite so big and strongI d give her a good shakingThere is just one piece of advice I should give herLet her make no attempt to lift any tricks from other writersThey are always evidentand never suitableFor her there is nothing but a lot of writingBarrels and barrels of itLet her carry along any of her present failings far enoughas she well mayand she will have achieved an original manner for her original matterIt would be as childish and futileof her as of anybody elseto take anything from Joycefor instanceHis technique is inseperable from his matterit will not do for anybody else what it does for himAnd surely she will not want to borrow from any author with an inferior equipmentAll this was a long way to go before reachingjhand the December numberbut I knew of no shorter wayI am not interested in shorn lambsand I knowfor another thingthat nothing and nobodynot even god himselfcould temperjh sblastand so I feel not in the least timid about writing in explanation of Maxwell BodenheimI believe that the blast atSinceritywas set off by Bodenheim s compliment to Djuna Barnesthough the greater and remoter cause was the heckling criticism of Evelyn ScottBodenheimunlike Evelyn Scottdid not find himself called upon to guardourEnglish literary traditionHe is no protector of literary law and orderEveryn Scott assumes that her own measure of judgment is correct beyond questionShe does not defend it against criticismshe merely describes itshe quotes you the decision from the textHer poetic demands are so many catagorieal imperativesthey are axiomaticThere is a dining room in Michigan Boulevardin Chicagofacing Lake MichiganThe windows of that dining room are kept shut summer and winterthat no air from the out of doors may enterinsteadthis dining room is supplied with washed air drawn from a narrow alley in the rear of the hotelI got the impression that Everyn Scott wants her poetic air washed and also combedperhapsIt hadthereforebest be admitted that the Baroness von Freytag Loringhoven takes her air unwashedEvelyn Scott s is a sophisicated mindHer emotions have to touch many ports before reaching their destinationEmotions that have not gone through the refining process of The Little Review 33 tense intellectualization are crude and vulgarHenceno poetry at allI can only wonder what Evelyn Scott will make ofjh sretort violent in the December numberThe reasoning back of Bodenheim s criticism of Djuna Barnes is not nearly so convoluted as that of Everyn Scott in the instance of the BaronessI shall spend no time defending the wordsincerity Let it mean free from waxor let it be thrown out of the lauguage for daring to meanas in the case of Bodenheima courageous truth tellingBodenheim did not question Djuna Barnesright to say what she didhe merely saidI understand what you meant to saybut you did not say it wellWhat he said amounts to thisDjuna Barnes having chosen a literary pattern with which he has no quarrelshould not have inserted certain specified elements in her compositionHad she chosen to draw her pattern on a larger scale he would not have found fault with these elementsBut since the scale of her drawing demanded the elimination of all but the most significantindispensibleand most pregnant elementsshe has not utilized her elements economicallyshe has retained what she should have eliminatedandinferentiallyshe has eliminated what she should have left inBodenheim did not mean that Djuna Barnes had done violence to certain conventional masksHe does not mean that an easy familiarity with Nietzsche and Schopenhauer does not go with small eyes and stupid surfacesHe simply means that these are not inevitably coupled togetherand since it was no part of her intention to show that these may be coupled togethershe should have left one or the other outor else introduced additional elements between these that they might not by their proximity attract attention to themselves I find that I have become academicwhich means it needs re writingwhich I cannot give itByboobsBen Hecht means men and women without seven league bootsinvisible cloaks and magic rings or swordsor their equivalents in moneybrainsbrawnor fabulous seductive charmsI hope he writes that novelWhat I am about to say reminds me of the story told of a young Indiana novelist on his first visit

advancing scienceEven if there wasn t that great French physiologist or chemist or something who looked at the result of experiments on animals and said helasnous avons les mains videsHe declared that there s nothing to be learned about human bodies from animals and even if there were the thing is that the animals have no choiceWe ve no right to force them to sufferAn animal s constituted differently to a manYou can t compare them in the matter of sensitiveness to painI knew you d say thatIf people really want to advance science by experiments on bodies they should offer their own bodiesSomeone s been working on your mind if you believe animals suffer more than menI d rather see a woman suffer than a man and a man rather than a child and a child rather than an animalAnimals are bewildered and don t understandThey have nothing to help themThey don t understand their sufferingsYou rate men lower than women in power to endure painThey get more practiceYou re right thereThey re less sensitiveThat s debateableWaynefleteWomen appear to be callous over the sufferings of other women and to make a fuss over menIt s because sick men are more helpless and pitifulWomen appear to beBut the sun appears to go round the earthI doubt if ever there ll come a time when we ll have live humanity in our experimental laboratiesScience has got to go ahead anywayBut if it goes ahead by forcing sensitive creatures with sensitive nerous systemsto bear fear and painwe shall lose more morally than we shall gain scientifically even if we gain scientifically and we don t because nearly everyone is illYou consider Knahludg can not be bought at too high a priceWell look at the continental luminarieswhere there are no restrictionsthey don t even care about their patientsonly diseases interest themand in generalnot only in science they don t really know anythingthe Germans and the Frenchyou have only to look at themThey are brutalThat s a large statementIf you ll pardon me I should say there s a certain amount of insular prejudice in thatI have not a scrap of insular prejudiceI like foreignersThey are more intelligent than EnglishmenBut there s something they don t know that makes them all alikeI once heard a wealthy old Jew say that he d go to Germany for diagnosis and to England for treatmentand he d had operations and illnesses all over the worldThat expresses itYou infer that the English have more humanityThey don t regard the patient as a case in the way continentals doWell I guess when we re sick we all like to go homeYou mean the Jew had no homeBut he chose the English to go home to when he was illThat s true in more senses than oneThis country s been a home for the Jews right away backIt s a great countryThat s sureScience has got to go away aheadIf you re going to be humanitarians over here you must leave continental science out of your schemeSo long as you carry out their results you can t honestly cry down their methodsYou must cry down their methods if you don t approve of themYou can t put backYou can t prevent association between the different landsespecially in matters of scienceWhat I m sayingYou ve got to accept the goodseven supposing your particular constitution of mind inclines you to bul leave them ill gottenIt s a case of good coming out of evilThat s Jesuiticalthe end justifying the meansI don t believe thatWhy should science go ahead so fastWhere s the hurry as you say in Canada The Little Review 43Wellyou ve only to look around to see thatI don t see itDo you mean the people who make scientific experiments
