the day that was that day Floated under a high Heaven  Home Home Home Sang a robin in a spice bush Sun on a roof tree Sun on a roof tree Rang thin clouds In a chord of silver across a placid sky  Rachel Gibbs stepped up the path To pass the time of day With Haywood Green s Minnie My ef she ain t shut the door An all the breeze this side the house too She must like to stew Minnie Minnie

Set down Minnie dear Set right here in the rocker An tell me What ails yer to be wantin To drink stuff like that There there you poor lamb Don t look so scared Just tell me all about it An ease your heart Minnie I ll have to shake yer Ef you don t stop starin In that dretful way Poor Dear   Amy Lowell  You just lay your head up agin me An let me soothe yer  Poor little thing Poor little thing  Don t don t Rachel I can t bear it I m a wicked woman But I jest couldn t stand no more  No more o what Ain t yer Pa good to yer What s come over yer Minnie My I m jest as sorry as I can be  Oh it ain

so  The cat s sick  Minnie Green was you takin poison Cause you got a sick cat That s down right foolishness  Yes it does sound so  But I couldn t face nussin her  Look here Rachel  I may be foolish or mad or jest plain bad  But I couldn t stan another thing  I m all fretted now  An more s one too many  I can t go on   Amy Lowell  Oh God I can t go on I ain t got no more n most women I know that But I fuss a lot more There s al ays the same things Goin roun like the spokes to a cart wheel Ef one ain t a top it s another An the next comin up all th time It s breakfast an dinner an supper Every day An the same dishes to wash  I hate them dishes I smashed a plate yesterday  Cause I couldn t bear to see it  Settin on the sink waitin fer me An when I go up to make Father s bed I git seasick Thinkin I ll have to see that old check spread agin I ve settled it An twitched it this way an that For thirty year An I hate the sight o the thing Sometimes I ve set an hour on the stair Ruther n go in an touch it Oh my God Why couldn t yer let me be Why d you have to come interferin Why Why   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Thank the Everlastin Mercy I did  But Minnie how long s this been goin on  I never had no idea anythin was wrong  I don t know For ever an ever I guess Rachel you can t think how hard it is for me To set one foot after the other sometimes I hate lookin out th winder I m so tired o seein the path to the barn An I can t hardly bear To hear Father talkin to the horses He loves em But I don t love nothin Cept the cat An cats is cold things to cling to An now mine s sick  Don t take on so Minnie She ll get well There you rest awhile You can tell me afterwards  A wind rose and a wind fell And the day that was that day Hung against a turning sun  The robin sang Home Home Home In an up and down scale of small bright notes The clouds rang silver arpeggios   Amy Lowell  Stretched across a pleasant sky  I wish I loved somethin Rachel  Bless your heart Child don t you love your father  I suppose so But he don t mean nothin ter me  He don t say nothin I want ter hear My ears is achin to hear words Words like what s written in books Words that would make me all bright like a spring day  I lay awake nights Thinkin o hearin things An seein things  I m awful tired o these hills They crowd in so  Seems sometimes ef I could see the ocean Or a real big city Twould help Kind o lay my eyes out straight for a while Everythin s so short here My eyes feels crinkled I love laylocks But I git so tired o watchin The leaves come and the flowers Every year the same I d like to root em up I ve set an set in the kitchen evenin s awful late Fer not bein able to git up and light the lamp   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  To go ter bed I m all lead somehow I guess ef anybody did say anythin I d be deaf Jest with listenin so long I m plumb tired out  Look a here Minnie Why don t you go away Fer a spell  Me go away Oh no I couldn t never do that I couldn t go no place I can t hardly git over to Dicksville Fer my week with Aunt Abby now I m all wrong away from home I can t do nothin Nothin at all I m so awful tired  Minnie did you ever love anybody Any man I mean  No Rachel I never did I know that sounds queer but it s a fact I ve tried to think I did But twarn t true I hadn t hardly no time for men folks Mother was sick so long   Amy Lowell  And then there was Father I never was much account with em anyway But I suppose I might ha had one Ef I d fixed my mind so But I al ays waited An now I m through waitin  I m through waitin fer anythin Rachel  It s jest go go go With never no end And nothin done that ain t to do over agin  There now it s six o clock And I must be gittin supper  You needn t move that cup Rachel  I ain t a goin to touch it  I ll jest keep on now till the Lord takes me An I only hope he ll do it soon  The robin flew down from the spice bush And pecked about for worms The clouds were brazen trumpets Tumbled along the edge of an apple colored sky The shadow of the house Fell across the path to the barn Confusing it with the grass and the daisies  A wind rose and a wind fell  And the day that was that day  Vanished in the darkness

Rigi Is it not love which gives immortality And Rigi s tears are dried  SONG  O my sweet dove when I kissed you it was night but the  night told it to the dawn the dawn to a star the star to  the moon The moon leaned down and told it to the sea the sea told  it to the oar and the oar to the sailor Thus it is that the sailor sings of our love The sailor says that you love me and the oar the sea the

come the swallows return and the doves two and two descend to the fountain  Yesterday returning from the isles I passed before her window She was watering her basil she was giving to drink to her flower of mint She cut a spray of basil she cut a flower of mint and she gave them me Sleep no more my heart March and May are come the swallows return and the doves two and two descend to the fountain  THE RED FISH  I kissed her red lips they dyed my own  I wiped them with a kerchief and the kerchief was dyed I washed the kerchief in the stream and the shores of the stream were dyed the waves of the sea kissed the shores of the stream and the sea grew red  That is why the little fish are grown red also that is why when I see them flickering I think of Photini of the red lips  From Antonin Proust s French version by Eunice Tietjens   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FOR BARBARA  Aged three and a little over  SLEEP THE MOTHER  Sleep the mother Has taken her over She has slipped from my arms Into the arms of this other Who has touched her softly Who has flushed her with dreaming This is not the same Sleep who gathers men Heavy with labor Women drugged with pleasure This is the mother Of little children only Moving as a wind From white spaces  Flushing their faces With a soft flame holily To whom the mothers of the earth Give up their children Joyously with a clean gladness With only a little sadness Such as hurts mothers For their mortality For they remember also   Florence Kiper Frank  Remembering swiftly Death too is a mother  But now her lashes curl delicately The blue veins of her eyelids Show sweetly in the soft skin Her red mouth droops slowly   Hovering over The child she is holding Is Sleep the white mother With arms enfolding  ELF CHILD  They ll get your rollicking spirit pretty soon Taming you to the observances of days They ll teach you how to tread the ordered maze Little wild baby dancing under the moon Not to go prancing at the call of the loon Mad little darling of the runaways Of conversation manner prim delays They ll tell you and nice use of the fork and spoon  Oh please oh please don t let it be all wasted That you from streams have drunk a dear delight You who have lived with faery and have tasted Delicate rumors stirrings of the sprite Do sometimes put your fingers to your nose And still go dancing on your little toes   THREE SONNETS  From a sequence  I  Some certainty Some light to guide the way Pure burning through the blackness or through murk Abstraction such as Duty Love your Work O darling if I could or might or may Wrest it from living I can t What shall I say Because for you there s the individual quirk And my salvation grievously might irk Your living soul that seeks a freer day  So always they tell the generations go Yet what s ahead This world this substance strange Gradually we ve fought clear of but are slow Oh very slow to fashion and arrange And melt and mold blows there an encircling fire This very hour white hot from our great desire  II  Suppose you have just a person for a mother  I at the outset candidly must confess  I m skeptical of my power to shield and bless Yet perhaps I ll do as well as she that other  Idealized For I swear that I ll not smother You your athletic soul with lusciousness   Florence Kiper Frank  Nor precepts redolent of the governess Nor padded quilts that serve the mind as cover  So here we are I having lived my years Up to I hope not half the time allotted You a beginner in this vale of tears Criss crossed they say with sun and shadow blotted  I can t assume omniscience Here s my hand My diffidence I trust you ll understand  III  Woman and freedom Freedom it is much You ll hear it often the tale how she has cast Gradually the shackles of the past And so moves forth transfigured Such and such Emerges now the female So and such  Is she and will be nun iconoclast Machinist priestess of Eros scholiast Does economist or artist give the touch  And here you stand or toddle innocent clear Of agony and of lives and creeds that are breaking How shall it be when you are sonneteer You girl child new with the world that s in the making You girl child who shall see what I can t see Of what she is Oh tell it truthfully  Florence Kiper Frank   THE DREAMERS OF DEATH  O Earth I wonder if your trees and flowers Have moods of death through their unmortal hours Like us your dreaming children Or have they Sprouted from your clay so short a way Rooted and planted in your procreant heart So deep and warm and passionate a part Of your great pattern and the mothering whole That they know only you body and soul Seed of your soil and root and stock and vine The fruit and flower only an up thrust sign Of your eternity that they are you How should they feel the change of old and new How should they dream of difference or death Whose withering unto the utmost breath Returns into the re creative sod To rise into re petaled proofs of God Whose fates are one with the on sweeping way Of beautiful progression and decay The sprout the stem the radicle the spray Perfume and ashes of petals blown away How should their branches hold the smallest dread That they must one day alter and be dead How should they shrink from death who have no birth Who are not even children who are Earth  We only have forsaken you for birth Severed the cord that binds us mother Earth   Julia Cooley Altrocchi  Sought separate life and individual breath And found upon the outer highway death Until we grow into your heart again Strike root and live with you we shall know pain And all the lonely terrors of our ways The disinherited and dismal days The suffering selves the alien entities The strange desires and empty destinies Restore us deep into your deathless scheme Dissolve our little spirits dream on dream Until they blend with wisdom of the trees Recurrent flowers and root eternities  Julia Cooley Altrocchi  THE TRAVELLER  I follow white roads to the north So straight they lie Through empty fields to purple hills Stretched thin against the sky  Yet however far they lead Sorrow will send Her messenger laden to greet me At the road s end  Anne Deacon   TASMANIAN SKETCHES  SUPPLICANTS  In the shimmering heat  Of the noon day sun The parched purple hills  Kneel to snow crowned Ben Lomond  Holding out supplicant hands  Craving a morsel of healing snow  God like austere unbending  Ben Lomond stands  Deaf to their prayers  GUM TREES  The gum trees during the spring rains grew so fast That their boughs are weak And cannot bear up the weight of russet leaves But droop towards the ground like willows  With the sun behind and a light wind stirring They are living fountains of flame  SKY  The summer sky is just a bowl Of old blue china The horizon hills serrate the rim   H W Stewart  And the tops of the tallest trees Etch patterns round the sides  Sometimes I think those great air planes Will fly too high And cut a jagged hole Then the

hand uncloses Between her hedges spread with spiders laces Narcissi pale and straight like April s rain The peony s deep stain Pansies with kittens faces And summer roses Whose yellow lingers from the summer dawn Remembering how she loves the rabbits on the lawn The barren desks and empty offices Where nothing wise is done Had nearly slipped my mind With all the deaf the tongueless and the blind Whose works and pupils thrive beneath the sun Unlovely and unkind  NOT HERE  Not here not here I have been here too many years Have stumbled about the darkened room for a door Seeing only the phantom shafts the moonlight clears The broken bars of silver along the floor  I can hear the women s laughter a song half blown Away by the wind through all the dust I can smell A garden wet with the rain And I am alone Not here old shadows I know you all too well  Edmund Wilson Jr   FUGITIVE  You are the shooting star That pales the Pleiades You are the frost That fires the autumn trees You are the sunset Upon cloud lost peaks You are the silence Music seeks You are the wind winged dream  I waken to and banish You are the hands that beckon me And beckoning vanish  Across the grass Yours are the white veils Of obliterating snow You are everyone I pass  And no one that I know  Susan M Boogher   THREE POEMS  FAMILY PORTRAIT  The picture hangs stiffly against the wall Rigidly framed within its final thought  At the right the faces of two children Emerging from straight dresses like round flowers in a pot Stare ahead wonderingly into a queer mist Whose changing shapes they need not fathom  In this moment their mother could not remember them She sits like someone suddenly blank Before an unheard command  Her tired breasts are trying all by themselves to rest Her legs standing apart do not know where they converge Her wandering lines have all halted a moment Like vague stray dogs pausing along a street  Her husband stands behind In his eyes is the peace of a blind man Whose unseen face scowls fiercely With his hands gripping hard surfaces  The grandmother at the left distant with age Worn like a kitchen knife to almost nothing Has gathered them all Within the wrinkled labyrinth of her compassion   Leo Grudsky  MELODRAMA  Your lips were attentive under my kisses To desperate whispers of escape  My sobs of renunciation Lay stunned with your gratitude  And when your petals weirdly late  Have graciously covered me  Will my heart a bit ashamed  Smile at a distant fragrance  IN THE MIRROR  I think I have taken  The shape that people die in  Pallor of an urn in which Inextinguishable ashes of hungers Send up endless wreaths that whirl and vanish With indifferent inevitability  Death powerless before the dead  Becomes my shadow  Leo Grudsky   IN MAINE  THE PILGRIMAGE  At Lewiston I went to the bridge I went to the bridge to linger there I wanted to look once more at the Androscoggin I wanted to watch its plunge between the cities As conquering hordes would appear through a breach in the  ramparts of a town so the Androscoggin appears through a break in the pines at the crest of its falls As the conquering hordes would plunge from the ramparts  to the streets so the river plunges to its lower channel It is mighty It is august  Nothing is changed There as ever are the mills that rise from the waters the old brick mills that were there when I was a child and that by the light of the moon seemed castles of old days They are not changed There as ever at the crest of the falls are the ancient pines  black scraggy that loom against the northern skies They are not changed  Nothing is changed The greater falls   Wallace Gould  amber and white silky voluptuous majestic resplendent descend about the enormous boulders which if viewed from the western shores form the face of the aged man The floods just now are mischievous On the brow of the aged man they have placed a slab of ice a dunce cap on the head of a scowling sage The sounding tons pour pompously to the lower basin From the basin scrolls of foam amber and white sweep down the river  Nothing is changed The western cataract tortuous precipitous vicious furious darts away from the greater falls and like a python striking from above lunges through the sluiceway of jagged boulders In the lower basin it thunders wildly Writhing lashing the deafening tons amber and white burst as ever into rolling mist that rises higher than houses  Do the columbines still grow by the western cataract They used to cling to the rocks by the lunging waters   and there they nodded in the spray There I used to go for sanctuary  I craved the holy silence of the din  THE LAST TABLEAU  It is October Let us go This is the grand finale Let us not wait for the curtain  I am tired of curtains  Look The passions of the world are posing and Atropos is stepping to the stage  Look The gaudy mountains are vain They are using the lake as a mirror They are peroxide Amazons searching for wrinkles  Look The stagehands are already setting the stage for an  other show They are bearing the pumpkins from the fields and are pulling down the stacks of beans They are ploughing the fields They are closing their doors Glance at the gorgeous stage once more Then let us turn away  Look There is a mountainside of yellow maples and another mountainside of maples that are crimson   Wallace Gould  Look The meadow is a silken baize It is variegated with tawn and green The design is of hunters pursuing a fox followed by dogs that sprawl in the air In the beech wood there is another baize a baize of flax The design is of scurrying chipmunks Beneath the pines there is still another baize a baize of hemp The design is of nervous deer that huddle together  This is the closing scene Now let us go  before the lines of Átropos begin  DIVERSION  Something is happening at last  now that the snowflakes are falling  Something is happening It has been too long that nothing has happened The poor old year has been a bore She has been unkempt She has worn a faded calico dress too ragged for repair She has murmured of doom She has crooned of former profusions of silk brocades rare perfumes or lovely lusts   I come to the forests Even now the forests are green and black but within them instead of the tawn of the spills there is the white of the snowflakes  I come to the fields Even now the fields are tawny but across them there are streaks of white the white of the snowflakes on the frozen brooks  I look at the skies Even now the skies are gray but the gray of the skies is enlivened with streaming white the white of the snowflakes The snowflakes are falling to circle or wander or dart or float all like children at play like desperate children awaiting the sound of the school bell  Something is happening at last now that the snowflakes are falling   Wallace Gould  POSTLUDE  By night in autumn do you ever listen for the waterfowl that are leaving the north In the east there is perhaps a harvest moon a golden moon in a porcelain sky and there are perhaps big stars that flare in a pellucid indigo The fields and the meadows are of bronze The stark stump fences are of silver unburnished The squashes and the pumpkins are of gold unburnished But do you ever listen for the cries of the waterfowl that are going away  In the cold clear mornings of autumn days do you ever watch for the waterfowl The squashes and the pumpkins glisten with frost and their blighted leaves all limp all black droop like the wings of slumbering bats The winds indifferent listless murmur among themselves Disclosing ripe apples red or russet the bronze tattered leaves flutter or sidle to the ground But do you ever search the skies for the waterfowl that are going away  Wallace Gould COMMENT  THE P S A PRIZES AND OURS  HE editors of POETRY give annual testimony to their belief in prizes scholarships and other endowments as a benefit to the arts and especially in the art of poetry the most ill paid of them all as a slight acknowledgment of their value before the public which is too ready to count values exclusively in dollars Human judgment represented in committees of award being fallible such tributes may go in fact often do go to the wrong persons but these mistakes in our opinion do not negative the advisability of such endowments which should increase both in number and size Thus the Poetry Society of America does well to raise five hundred dollars annually as an honorarium to the American poet publishing the best book of verse during the previous calendar year This year a particularly fit committee of award had the disposal of the honor Edwin Arlington Robinson whose distinction requires no emphasis John Livingston Lowes whose Convention and Revolt is the most enlightened study of modern poetry yet written and Alice Corbin Henderson from the first an associate editor of POETRY In these appointments the officers of the P S A did their best If they had been equally careful in preparing the list of 1919 books for the committee to choose from commendation would be complete but it will appear below that at least one important book of the year was either never   The P S A Prizes and Ours  included in or was definitely withdrawn from the lists sent to two of the committee  The award as recently announced in the papers is a tie between Poems by the late Gladys Cromwell and The Song of Three Friends by John G Neihardt Because of Miss Cromwell s most lamentable death the Society very properly gives the entire five hundred dollars to Mr Neihardt but the public should remember that honors are equal  While we must disagree with half of the award believing that The Song of Three Friends is fundamentally unsound as a work of art still we may congratulate its author upon receiving half the honor and all the money Mr Neihardt has been from the first an enthusiast true to his ideals In 1907 his career as a poet began with A Bundle of Myrrh a book which then seemed progressive and ultramodern If he lost his stride became so entangled in worn out theories and formalities that a troop of younger poets have passed him by still he has done enough so that we need not regret the leaf of laurel nor the paltry purse which is all too slight an enrichment to a poet compelled to live austerely in order to keep faith with his art Moreover his book is part of a large design celebrating a big American subject the conquest of the West by the pioneer And while we believe that his reach has been beyond his grasp that his manner is quite out of accord with his matter still no one can present claims to infallibility and time alone will pronounce the final verdict   With Miss Cromwell s half of the honor we are much more in sympathy as our review of her book last May would indicate The emphasis thus placed upon a book of profound feeling expressed with a lyric precision austerely delicate and beautiful can but add to the universal sorrow for this poet s tragic and too early death  The awards present an interesting study of contrasting personalities and opinions When the New York Times report came in the writer being absolutely without inside or outside information set out to solve the psychological arithmetical puzzle of the different judges votes After announcing the award The Times said  Amy Lowell s Pictures of the Floating World and Clement Wood s The Earth Turns South each received three points in the voting while Starved Rock by Edgar Lee Masters received two points and Marjorie Allen Seiffert s A Woman of Thirty and Eunice Tietjens Body and Raiment received one point each  Each judge gave three points to his first choice two to his second and one to his third making eighteen points in all from the three judges It seemed probable that Mrs Henderson s first choice was Miss Cromwell and inevitable after a perusal of Professor Lowes book that his first choice was Miss Lowell But the two winners received four points each therefore Miss Cromwell must have had one point from another judge probably Prof Lowes So all the third choices were disposed of Mrs Seiffert s one point probably coming from Mrs Henderson and Mrs Tietjens from Mr Robinson Therefore Mr Neihardt could not have been anybody s first or third choice and I was con   The P S A Prizes and Ours  fronted with the incredible fact that Mr Robinson must  have given first place to Clement Wood s book Thus the  list was complete as follows and the president of the P S A  authorizes the announcement that it is correct  Mrs Henderson Poems by Gladys Cromwell Starved Rock by Edgar Lee Masters A Woman of Thirty by Marjorie Allen Seiffert  Professor Lowes Pictures of the Floating World by Amy Lowell The Song of Three Friends by John G Neihardt Poems by Gladys Cromwell  Mr Robinson The Earth Turns South by Clement Wood The Song of Three Friends by John G Neihardt Body and Raiment by Eunice Tietjens  The list presents an extraordinary scattering of opinions  three competent judges voting for six different books in the  nine places A close contest and a divided honor the win  ners receiving each less than one fourth of the eighteen points  listed Apparently it would be better if the first vote were  merely tentative the judges conferring later and arguing  the matter out to a more satisfactory conclusion Such a  conference would have prevented the injustice referred to  in the following letter  Editor of POETRY While I am not permitted to disclose the source and the nature of my proof I assert and am prepared to prove to the committee of the Poetry Society of America or to any other body empowered to investigate the matter that the judges of the best book of poems by an American author published during the year 1919 did not pass upon all the books of poetry published during that year Without fault on the part of the judges two of them did not see or consider Starved Rock which was published by the Macmillan Company in early December 1919 The award   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  therefore under any rules possibly applicable to such a decision is void  While feeling as I have always felt that such contests and decisions are unimportant and valueless to everyone deciding as they do what judges cannot decide the cause of American letters suffers injury and a certain degradation in the circumstance that a prize award of 500 00 has passed without the judges going over all the books published during the year for which the award is made I should not be surprised if the contest were reopened that Mr Neihardt would win the prize and I should be glad for an excellent thing done if he did It is all the more necessary in that case that his honorarium should be freed of doubt  Edgar Lee Masters  Besides this award the P S A clinging to an unfortunate habit gives two prizes of 150 and 100 to the two poems receiving the preferential vote first from members of the society who heard them read anonymously at the five regular meetings in New York last winter second from members who voted on the ten poems so preferred which were submitted to them in pamphlet form These prizes have been awarded to The Dancer at the Shrine by Amanda B Hall and Two on a Hill by Leonora Speyer  Without reference to these poems or any others the manifest objections to the artistic principle or lack of it involved demand re statement first the poems anonymously read at these meetings are a haphazard collection second the members voting at each meeting represent not the society in general but merely its New York contingent and their vote is given hastily from one or two casual hearings third the general membership of the society receiving the pamphlet containing the ten preferred poems cannot be expected to vote with much interest for prizes which represent merely   The P S A Prizes and Ours  a local effort to give zest to the higher vaudeville of the monthly New York meetings  The prizes awarded every November by the staff of POETRY follow the example of the current exhibitions of painting and sculpture which have been the magazine s model ever since it began that is they are an effort to discover and honor the most distinguished poems which have appeared in our current exhibition one year s issues of the magazine We wish we had as many prizes and as large ones to dispose of in our Announcement of Awards this month as the jury at the Chicago Art Institute which will give to fortunate American exhibitors medals of gold silver and bronze accompanied by money awards of 3400 divided into 1500 1000 500 300 and 100 And we eagerly present to men and women of sufficient wealth the rightful claims of the art of poetry to numerous scholarships for the benefit of gifted young poets who deserve and need them Such scholarships are common in the other arts although clever young painters sculptors architects can earn a very good living The claim of poets to such recognition and assistance is the strongest of all because they can earn little or nothing by the practice of their art  Most foreign nations are more liberal with such awards than our own France has several including the liberal Prix Goncourt England grants Civil List pensions to a few poets and there are private endowments as well For example the Hawthornden Prize of one hundred pounds with a silver medal for a work of imaginative literature of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  which Edward Shanks carried off the initial award last year has just been awarded for 1920 to Poems New and Old by John Freeman Selwyn amp Blount The judges were the same as last year Messrs Lawrence Binyon  J C Squire and Edward Marsh H M  REVIEWS  A LAURELLED POEM  The Song of Three Friends by John G Neihardt Mac  millan Co  This book has not hitherto been reviewed in POETRY because it seemed unnecessary to repeat criticisms fully suggested in February 1916 in a notice of The Song of Hugh Glass the first poem published of its author s projected epic series though the second in artistic order But the recent  P S A award to this book as one of the two best American books of verse of 1919 asserting as it does at least the second choice of men like Mr Robinson and Professor Lowes seems to call for a more complete statement of our exceptions to the committee s verdict our reasons for thinking this poem fundamentally unsound as a work of art  The reasons are essentially one the discord between the story and the style The poet s project a series of narratives presenting that most romantic period of American history the winning of the West by adventurous wanderers and traders is an heroic adventure itself and not more   A Laurelled Poem  deliberate a literary plan perhaps than most epics But having started he lacked the native human spirit the unconscious courage of his heroes he couldn t give himself wholeheartedly to his adventure let his subject carry him but must needs load it with all the rhetorical and legendary impedimenta of many races many literatures He set out carrying not only the heroic couplet of Pope and all the archaisms of so called poetic language now quaintly rococo but also all the approved lesser classic traditions of epic form and style These details of manner when applied to a story of wild western pioneers effect a discordant incongruity at times absurd The following examples are typical  Gauche girls with rainy April in their gaze Cling to their beardless heroes count the days Between this parting and the wedding morn Unwitting how unhuman Fate may scorn The youngling dream  Now at whiles The kiote s mordant clamor cleaves the drowse  And lustily the hewers sang at whiles  Thus merrily the trappers took their ease Rejoicing in the thread that Clotho spun  For Ilion held Beneath her sixfold cerement of Eld Seems not so hoar as bygone joy we prize In evil days  And this of a troop of trappers having a grand old drunk  What roaring nights of wassailing they knew Gargantuan regales when through the town   The fiery liquor ravined melting down The tribal horde of beaver How they made Their merest gewgaws mighty in the trade Aye merry men they were  Now the point POETRY has been insisting on for eight years is that this kind of thing is not only false taste but fundamentally bad art Not only does it artificialize the tale in the same way but to a greater degree that Pope artificializes Homer but it entirely misses indeed violates its flavor a flavor which a first rate poet approaching his job in a sincere and honest spirit would have caught with all its wild barbaric tang The reader faces an elaborately wrought out incongruity which forces him to one of two courses either he must adjust his mind to the poem as an example of the china shepherdess type of art a type developed with a certain sincerity by the artists of Du Barry s highly elaborated court but rather strained in our democratic place and period or he must reject the poem alto gether as mere confusion and absurdity the leaning of a second rate mind upon traditions unfit for his chosen subject and therefore a false presentation a mere prettifying and belittling of the wild epic grandeur of our pioneer history  Let us seize for the moment the first horn of the dilemma and discover if we can what Messrs Robinson and Lowes found in this book to justify even second place in their lists Admitting that Mr Neihardt s trappers willed to tarry instead of decided to camp and rejoiced in the thread that Clotho spun and looked like unhappy spirits   A Laurelled Poem  on the dim far shore of Styx when scrambling from enemies and that a western girl s beauty can t be asserted without reference to Helen Iphigenia and Iseult admitting indeed the poet s pseudo classic assumptions and prejudices we may find good lines vivid figures and passages of resounding rhymed eloquence also a very proper strengthening and simplification of style toward the tragic climax of the tale For example  A cedar of a man he towered straight  He shuddered gazing where the gray sky bled With morning like a wound  A trailing flight of southbound whooping cranes Across the fading West was like a scrawl Of cabalistic warning on a wall And counselled haste  And this of a mare found dead after escape from a prairie  fire She had run With saddle panniers powder horn and gun Against the wind thewed fillies of the fire And won the heat to perish at the wire  The narrative pauses for long classically wrought similes and the fight between the two great bodied men is described with almost Homeric no Vergilian dignity Then the murder the fire the murderer s blurting out of the truth and the weird vengeance of his little companion all these are dramatically presented A good workman is Mr Neihardt however mistaken his design The poem has a beginning a carefully wrought climax and a shaped and conclu   sive end The poet s art elaborates and artificializes but it does not sprawl  Probably Mr Robinson and Professor Lowes felt that Mr Neihardt had done in good workmanlike fashion what he set out to do But it would be interesting to know how far they sympathized with his aim and method Prof Lowes may not have completely rid his mind of classic prejudices in spite of all that he grants in his Convention and Revolt to Amy Lowell and other truly modern poets but it is the Robinson of Merlin and Lancelot never the Robinson of A Town down the River who gave Mr Neihardt the leaf of laurel H M  LIGHTS AHEAD  Broken Lights by Glenn Hughes University of Washing  ton Seattle  This book may be the first sign of a revolution it was  accepted by the English department of the University of Washington instead of a thesis for the master s degree This is the only instance so far as I have been able to find out of an American university considering creative work worth an advanced degree But others will follow  The preface is written by the head of the department Dr Frederick Morgan Padelford who is widely known as a literary scholar Dr Padelford points out that the creation of art is at least as severe a test of culture and of   Lights Ahead  refined and disciplined thinking as the ability to reason sagely upon the art created by others  Broken Lights is not great poetry but it approaches great poetry much more closely than the average master s thesis approaches great research no matter how many rainy days have been spent in dark attics or libraries The worst poems in the book are in the section entitled Pro Patria Mr Hughes is such an orotund patriot as might appropriately preside over a Harding or Cox rally The best poems are those which deal with the fancies of youth its half remembered sorrows and its vagrant many colored joys They manifest an appreciation of fragile beauty and in many cases an appropriate deftness of touch marred however by a certain clinging to the conventional Mr Hughes shows promise  Here are two thirds of a poem whose first sentence is its title  God made the dark for silence Mark the hush That falls so swiftly on the purpling hills The feathery singers crouch within the brush Leaving but dreamy echoes of their trills  Sound is no more Those drooping poplars there Tall shadowy fingers that seek out the clouds Whisper no longer bathed by the soft air They merge with Silence and assume her shrouds The importance of the book lies not so much in what it contains or promises for its author as in what it promises for letters in American colleges wherever professors of English have enough vision Nelson Antrim Crawford   A FLAG OF TRUCE  Something Else Again by F P A Doubleday Page amp Co Types of Pan by Keith Preston Houghton Mifflin Co Including Horce by Louis Untermeyer Harcourt Brace and Howe Idylls of the Skillet Fork by Payson S Wild Ralph Fletcher Seymour Farm Voices by Don  C Seitz Harper amp Brothers  We know you hate our lines so free Pray do not hate our charity  Perhaps if I start out humbly with the above technically perfect couplet Mr F P A will in his next book and I hope there will be one omit his emphatic and frequent damning of vers libre For why let a poetic prejudice get into a book of verse And Something Else Again is the cream of the variety that B L T aptly christened not poetry but verse  The thoroughness with which Mr Adams draws the last giggle from the many chambered vat of humor makes a reviewer shudder at the prolific possibilities of his writing serious verse seriously In Something Else Again there is a blithe determination to appeal to all classes to everyone which is proclaimed by a highly specialized versatility in international local political rural patrician plebeian and plain rare universal humor humor that delights without being bombastic or crude that strikes a happy medium between the Hence loathed melancholy and the sweetie collect your gloom in some other nightmare attitude And   A Flag of Truce  there is no obscenity and no sentimentality which are the two tiresome customary adjuncts of the tiresome customary would be humorist Mr Adams has learned the lesson which that pioneer in paragraphing Mr Bert Leston Taylor taught him namely that only by a rigid concentration on humor and a strict aversion from all other emotional reactions will the laugh take care of itself And while mentioning Mr Taylor I want to thank him again for a number of poems in his book A Line o Verse or Two Reilly amp Britton Co especially In the Sun which has been as helpful this summer as ever  Shine on Old Top shine on Across the realms of space  Shine on What though I m in a sorry case What though my collar is a wreck And hangs a rag about my neck What though at food I can but peck  Never you mind Shine on  Shine on Old Top shine on Through leagues of lifeless air  Shine on It s true I ve no more shirts to wear My underwear is soaked tis true My gullet is a red hot flue But don t let that unsettle you  Never you mind Shine on It shines on  B L T and F P A are the genuine humorists while the others Preston Untermeyer Wild and Seitz are only facile rhymers with some humor Preston a stepping stone   between the two classes in spite of his disastrous serious moments Untermeyer with his parodies and paraphrases mildly amusing painstakingly clever quite unspontaneous neither flesh fish nor fowl Wild with his ponderous fun further encumbered by an exhaustive use of dialect  I am aware that dialect gives atmosphere a cloudy atmosphere Seitz with his gentle humor quiet philosophy casual rhythms and rhymes like a pleasant lazy effortless smile  But to revert to Mr Adams I want to quote the amusing Unshackled Thoughts on Chivalry Romance Adventure  Yesterday afternoon while I was walking on Worth Street A gust of wind blew my hat off I swore petulantly but somewhat noisily A young woman had been near walking behind me She must have heard me I thought And I was ashamed and embarrassedly sorry So I said to her If you heard me I beg your pardon But she gave me a frightened look And ran across the street Seeking a policeman So I thought why waste five hours trying to versify the incident Vers libre would serve her right  L envoi my own  I like you Mr F P A But say Vers libre is not Prose that s all dressed up And no Place to go  Marion Strobel  CORRESPONDENCE  A WORD FROM MR WALEY  Editor of POETRY Perhaps you will allow me a few words of reply to Mr Fujita s review of my book on Japanese poetry  He quotes my translation of the poem about the saltburners and says Reading the translation one wonders what it is all about In the original he continues I feel the quietude of a spring evening etc  Now the unexpressed connotations of the poem detailed by the reviewer are quite as easily derivable from the statements of the translation as from those of the original From the translation any intelligent European reader would deduce just as Mr Fujita does from reading the Japanese that the sea is calm that there is no wind that a boat or two may be crossing the bay and so on What the translation unavoidably lacks is beauty of form The originals I can assure Mr Fujita have if I may take the poem he quotes as an example of what an uta does convey to him just the same connotations for me as for him And I think that the translations would suggest to anyone sufficiently familiar with English the same unexpressed inferences as the originals do Certainly the word salt burners would not as Mr Fujita suggests convey the idea of witches to any Englishman  It is not necessary for the translator to detail these inferences and connotations as Japanese often do when intro   ducing us to their poetry for he addresses himself solely to persons of an imagination sufficiently active to supply the background for themselves  In short Mr Fujita admits that I understand the expressed but doubts whether I understand the unexpressed in Japanese poetry thus assuming that I have no poetic imagination which without further proof seems to me ungenerous We are in general so much clumsier than the Japanese that I think they are sometimes tempted to forget that we poor creatures have any wits at all  Arthur Waley  A POET S PROTEST After reading the Announcement in the last POETRY  The printer and the binder The printer s devil too And all except the poor contrib What can the devil do  The office must be paid for The added price of coal And everything keeps going up Except the poet s dole  And still he sings though hunger Should make his stomach squirm What bird could sing so loud a note With such a slender worm Anon ANNOUNCEMENT OF AWARDS  Following our agreeable November custom the editorial staff of POETRY has the honor of awarding three prizes for good work printed in the magazine

air  THE PLACE OF THE SOLITAIRES  Let the place of the solitaires  Be a place of perpetual undulation  Whether it be in mid sea On the dark green water wheel Or on the beaches There must be no cessation  Of motion or of the noise of motion The renewal of noise And manifold continuation  And most of the motion of thought  And its restless iteration  In the place of the solitaires Which is to be a place of perpetual undulation   The Prize Poems  THE PALTRY NUDE STARTS ON A SPRING VOYAGE  But not on a shell she starts  Archaic for the sea  But on the first found weed  She scuds the glitters  Noiselessly like one more wave  She too is discontent And would have purple stuff upon her arms Tired of the salty harbors Eager for the brine and bellowing Of the high interiors of the sea  The wind speeds her Blowing upon her hands And watery back She touches the clouds where she goes In the circle of her traverse of the sea  Yet this is meagre play In the scurry and water shine  As her heels foam  Not as when the goldener nude Of a later day  Will go like the centre of sea green pomp In an intenser calm Scullion of fate Across the spick torrent ceaselessly Upon her irretrievable way  W e reprint the poem by Miss Edna St Vincent Millay  which wins a prize for its author  THE BEAN STALK  Ho Giant This is I I have built me a bean stalk into your sky La but it s lovely up so high    This is how I came I put There my knee here my foot Up and up from shoot to shoot And the blessed bean stalk thinning Like the mischief all the time Till it took me rocking spinning In a dizzy sunny circle Making angles with the root Far and out above the cackle Of the city I was born in Till the little dirty city In the light so sheer and sunny Shone as dazzling bright and pretty As the money that you find In a dream of finding money What a wind what a morning Till the tiny shiny city When I shot a glance below Shaken with a giddy laughter Sick and blissfully afraid Was a dew drop on a blade And a pair of moments after Was the whirling guess I made And the wind was like a whip Cracking past my icy ears And my hair stood out behind And my eyes were full of tears Wide open and cold More tears than they could hold The wind was blowing so And my teeth were in a row Dry and grinning And I felt my foot slip And I scratched the wind and whined And I clutched the stalk and jabbered With my eyes shut blind What a wind what a wind Your broad sky Giant Is the shelf of a cupboard I make bean stalks I m A builder like yourself   The Prize Poems  But bean stalks is my trade I couldn t make a shelf Don t know how they re made Now a bean stalk is more pliant La what a climb  With the following poem Mr Maurice Lesemann wins the prize offered by Mrs Speyer  A MAN WALKS IN THE WIND  Being so tired it is hard to hide from you  It is hard to walk any longer in the night and the wind  I have gone among brown trees I have crunched the blue  Frost bitten grass under my feet I have stood  In parted thickets caught in the crackling leaves  I have seen the brush piles on the ridges fired  I have watched the twisted smoke that weaves  Blue strands in the black branches of the wood  And now being tired  Being tired now and worn enough for rest  Would it not be safe would it not be very good  Tonight to find it in your breast  In your wise breast where this is understood  Do you remember another night of wind  Moonlight and wind when it was all  The sky could do to keep from reeling upon us in shame  When breathless we held it there  From slipping down about us with your hair  Do you remember a night last fall  When the wind whirled us and whetted us to flame  And whirled the leaves and whetted us to flame  Whipped out your dress and would not let us be  And drove us along the prairie two shadows clinging  And dropped us at the foot of a tree  That was September before the frost  In the morning the prairie was gray with mist   And the grass was matted white where we had lain And the arms of the elm the grizzled arms of the elm Pawed at the wind for something that was lost And knotted up with pain  Fall comes to fall again And I walk alone I walk alone in the wind I cannot master the beauty of the night I walk alone The poplar fingers rise Tall and awful among white glittering stars Surely this is the most sorrowful delight Of any man to walk alone with a dream Do you hear the ripple singing in the stream The beauty of the poplars strikes me down The wind over the grass I had not known The wind was such a lonely thing The wind cleaves me with beauty to the bone And the gray clouds that brush the fields and fling Gray darkness on to the driven prairie and fold Their lonely silence around the hills and fly On to the upper night to the upper air They have beat me clean they have beat my body cold With beauty Do you hear the wild geese cry And now the dark is heavy in my head And in my heart all the sorrows have come home I am tired you do not know how tired I come You would not care tonight You would not care But let your hand wander through my hair There would be no hurt now we are both too tired I would finger the soft silk of your dress the same As long ago when you were first desired As long ago when the wind whirled us to flame For we know the bitter tune the wind sings There will be silence now there will be rest And eyes will heal after the wind stings And I shall hear your heart under your breast  Moving across time with a great flow And we shall hear no more the wind s calling But only the silence of it falling and falling And always the room will throb quietly and slow  NOTES  Miss Amy Lowell of Brookline Mass requires no introduction to readers of POETRY Her latest book is Pictures of the Floating World Macmillan Co
