the Innermost MARGARET CANDERSON The popular translation of that dangerous termindividualismisselfishness Self dependence is a pompous phraseand self completion a huge negationThe average mind seems never to grasp the fact that individualism and democracy are synonymous terms that self dependence is merely the first of one s intricate obligations to his universeand self completion the first step toward that wider consciousness which makes the giving out of self valuableI am always feeling that some one will point out to mewith the most embarrassing justicethe obviousness of observations like theseBut invariablyafter a resolve to keep to those high levels which stretch out beyond the boundaries of the acceptedsome one engages me in a discussionsome one who still believes in the antique theory that life proceeds for the sake of immortalityor that a woman must choose between her charm and the ballot and I emerge therefrom convinced that the highest mission in life is the dedication of oneself to the obviousand that a valiant preaching of truisms is the only way to get at the root of intellectual evilsIt has its The Little Review fascinationsbesidesto convince a reactionarynot that I ve ever done itthat renunciation is not an ultimate endor that truth is a good thing for all peopleis better than discovering a kindred soulAnd so I proceedwithout further apology that human being is of most use to other people who has first become of most use to himselfIt is the war that has emphasized so overwhelmingly the triviality of trivial thingsOut of such utter dehumanization one has a vision of the race which might emergea race purified of small strugglessmall causessmall patriotisms a race animated by those big impulses which have always made up the dreams of menAnd then would come the more subtle personal developmenta race of human units purged of small ideals and ambitionscleansed to the point where education can at least proceed with economythat iswithout having to destroy two ounces of superstition to produce one ounce of knowledgeAnd at the foundation of such a race structureI believewill be a corner stone of Individualismor whatever you may choose to call itWhat it means is very simple it is a matter of heightened inner lifeOur cultureor what little we have of such a thingis clogged by masses of dead people who have no conscious inner lifeThe man who asked Did you ever see an old artist put a profound questionPeople get old because they have no visionAnd they have no vision because they have no inner lifeOf courseany sort of inner life is impossible to the man or woman who must be a slave instead of a human beingAnd this brings usof courseto a discussion of economic emancipationwhich I shall not take advantage ofbecause I want to talk here not of what the individual should have done for himbut of what he might very well do for himselfThere are so many slaves whose bondage can be traced to no cause except their refusal or their inability to come to life and the significance of the fact that spiritual resourcefulness is most rare among those persons who have the most leisure to cultivate it need not be emphasized even in an article devoted to the apparentHuman weakness is reducible to so many causes beside that much abused one ofcircumstance We talk so much nonsense about people not being able to help themselvesThe truth is that people can help themselves out of nine tenths of all the trouble they get into We ll leave the other tenth to circumstance If they could only be made to realize thisor that if they are helped out by some one else they might as well stay in troubleTo be dragged out is more desirable than starving to deathbecause it is more sensibleand because people are so sentimental in their attitude toward receiving that one welcomes almost any emergency which drives them to accepting aid with grace and honestyanything to teach a man that he need not smirk about taking what he himself would like to give without being smirked atBut in spite of thisone must help himself to anything which is to be of positive value to him and must The Little Review learn that personality gets what it demandsHoweverthis begins to sound like a pamphlet from East AuroraAs a result of our shabby thinking on the subject of self dependence we have lowered our standards of the exceptional to an alarming degreeWe call that person exceptional who does what almost any one might do but doesn tFor instanceThe average girl of twenty in a conventional home hates to be told that she must not read Havelock Ellis or make friends with those dreadful persons known vaguely associalists or that she must not work when she happens to believe that work is a beautiful thingShe is submerged in the ghastly sentimentalities of a tradition soaked atmosphereand heaven knows that sentimentalities of that type are difficult to break away fromIt takes not only brainsbut what William James called the fundamental human virtuebraveryto do itAnd so the girl gives up the fight and moans that circumstances were too much for herThe next stage of her development shows her passing around gentle advice to all her friends on the noble theme of not beinghardand living only for oneselfhow one must sacrifice to the general goodnever having had the courage or the insight to find out what the general good might really beThus are our incapacities extendedThe girl who did break away she regards secretly as remarkablewhich is not necessarily trueIt is not that the second girl is remarkablebut that the first one is inadequateThe average man of thirty five slaves all day in an office and comes home at night to wheel the baby around the block and fall asleep over the newspaperHe has lost any feeling of rebellionsimply because he feels that he mustHis permanent attitude is that all men are more or less in the same conditionor should beif they re well behaved and that to part with a vision after college is what any man of sense must doHis neighbor with an eye on something beyond an office desk and a go cart is a dreamer or a fool if the neighbor makes good with his dreamthen he is a remarkable man of extraordinary capabilitiesWhich is not necessarily trueeitherthe dreamer has simply scorned that attitude which has been so aptly epitomized asthe second choice There are as many phlegmatic radicals as there are conservatives and there is no type among them more exasperating than the one that is content to sit around and be radicaland be nothing elseThe lazy evasiveness of therevolutionarywith his the world owes me a living air positively sicken meWhy should the world owe anybody anything except a protection against that lack of struggle which cramps one s intellectual muscles so hideouslyAnd then there is that most unpleasant type of allthe man who boasts of how he will use his chance when he gets itHe always gets itof coursebut he doesn t know itAnd when it comes out boldly and takes him by the ear he becomes terrified and slips back under the cover of things as they areHis is the most unattractive kind of intellectual cowardicebecause it involves so many liesit is simply a rapid sequence of boasting and fright and refusing to meet the truthHere they all are the uncourageous company of the second choicethe half peoplethe makeshiftsthe compromisersthe near adventurersHow pale and ambling they lookhow they crawl through the world with their calculating side looksready to take any second rate thing when the first rate one costs too muchOhit is a sad sightWe must be more braveWe must be more fineWe must be more demandingThe saddest aspect of the whole thing is that choice is such a tiny element in the process of becomingIt is after one has chosen highly that his real struggle and his real joy beginsAnd only on such a basis is built up that intensity of inner life which is the sole compensation one can wrest from a world of mysterious terrors and of ecstasies too dazzling to be sharedSouls are weighed in silenceas gold and silver are weighed in pure waterand the words which we pronounce have no meaning except through the silence in which they are bathed MaeterlinckThe Little Review A Letter from London AMY LOWELL August 281914As I sit hereI can see out of my window the Red Cross flag flying over Devonshire HouseOnly one short month ago I sat at this same window and looked at Devonshire Houseglistening with lightsand all its doors wide openfor the duke and duchess were giving an evening partyPowdered footmen stood under the porte cochèreand the yard was filled with motors it was all extremely well ordered and gayI watched the people arriving and leavingfor a long timeIt was a very late partyand it was not only broad daylightbut brilliant sunshinebefore they went homeThey did have such a good timethose boys and girlsand they ended by coming out on the balcony and shouting and hurrahing for fully ten minutesHow many of those young men were among thetwo thousand casualtiesat the Battle of Charleroiof which we have just got news Devonshire House is as busy this afternoonbut it is no longer gayIn the yard is a long wooden shedwith a corrugated iron roof there are two doors on opposite sideslike barn doorsand black against the light of the farther door I can see men sitting at a tableand boy scouts running upon errandsThe yard is filled with motors againand there is a buzz of coming and goingYesterday a man brought a sort of double decked portable stretcherwith a place above and belowand a group stood round it and talked about it for a long timeFor this is the headquarters of the Red Cross SocietySoin one short monthhas life changedhere in LondonA month ago I toiled up the narrow stairs of a little outhouse behind the Poetry Bookshopand in an atmosphere of overwhelming sentimentalitylistened to MrRupert Brooke whispering his poemsTo himselfit seemedas nobody else could hear himIt was all artificial and preciousOne longed to shoutto chuck up one s hat in the street when one got outsideanythingto show that one was not quite a mummyyetNowI could weep for those poorsilly peopleAfter all they were happythe world they lived in was secureToday this horrible thing has fallen upon themand not for fifty yearssay those who knowcan Europe recover herself and continue her developmentWas the world tooprecious did it need these violent realities to keep its vitality aliveHistory may have something to say about that we who are here can only see the pity and waste of itSo little expectation of war was thereso academic theconversationsbetween the powers seemedthat on the Fridaypreceding the declaration The Little Review 7 of warwe went down to Dorchester and Bath for a week end outingIt was rather a shock to find the market place at Salisbury filled with cannonand the town echoing with soldiersThe waiter at the innhoweverassured us that it was only man uvresBut the next day our chauffeurwho had been fraternizing with the soldierstold us that it was not man uvres they had started for man uvresbut had been turned roundand were now on their way back to their barracksAs we came back from Bathon Mondaywe were told that gasolene was over five shillings a canThat was practically saying that England had gone to warBut she had notnor did sheuntil twelve o clock that nightWhen we reached our hotel we found a state bordering on panicThere was no money to be gotand all day longfor two dayspeopleAmericanshad been arriving from the ContinentWithout their trunksnaturallyThere was no one to handle trunks at the stations in ParisThese refugees were all somewhat hysterical perhaps they exaggerated when they spoke of disorder in Paris later arrivals seemed to think soBut we are untried in warwar round the cornerIt is a terrifying nightmare which we cannot take for realityOr could notFor it is now three weeks since the war burst over usand already we accustom ourselves to the new conditionThat is perhaps the most horrible part of itBut that first night in London I shall never forgetA great crowd of people with flags marched down Piccadillyshouting We want warWe want warThey sang the Marseillaiseand it sounded savageabominableThe blood lust was coming backwhich we had hoped was gone forever from civilized racesBut the Londoners are a wonderful peopleOr perhaps they have no imaginationLondon goes onand goes on just as it did beforeas far as I can seeI understand that the American paperspossibly taking their cue from the German paperssay that London is like a military campthat soldiers swarm in the streetsand that its usual activities are all stoppedIt is not true Business as usualhas become a sort of mottoAnd it is as usualperhaps a bit too much soThe mass of the people cannot be brought to realize the possibility of an invasionIn vain the papers warn themthey believe the navy to be invincibleAnd Heaven grant that it is Whenthat first week of the warbank holiday was extended to four days instead of one when the moratorium was declaredwhich exempted the banks from paying on travellers cheques and letters of credit and whento add to thatso many boats were taken offand there were no sailings to be got for love or moneysomething closely approaching a panic broke out among the AmericansAnd what wonder They felt caught like rats in a trapwith the impassable sea on one side and the advancing Germans on the otherFor Americans have not been brought up with the tradition of England s invincibility at seaThey have heard of John Paul Jones and theBonhomme Richard And they have imaginationI was told that one woman had killed herself in an access of fearand I have heard of another who has had to be put in an asylumher mind given way under the strainMany of these people had no moneyand they could not get anythey came from the Continent and had to find lodgingsand they could offer neither money nor creditThe Embassy had no way of meeting the strain flung upon itThe Ambassador is not a rich manand the calls for money were endlessFinally some public spirited American gentlemen started a Committeewith offices at the Hotel Savoyto help stranded AmericansAnd the work they have done has been so admirable that it is hard to find words to describe itThe Committee cashes chequesgets steamship bookingssuggests hotels and lodgingsprovides clothesmeets trainsI cannot write the half it doesbut it makes one exceedingly proudI do not believe that there is an American in London who has not helped the Committee with time or moneyor been helped by itPerhaps the panicky ones have all been cared for and gone homeor perhaps man is a very adaptable animalBut we who are still in London have settled down and accepted thingsThe town is not like a campbut still regiments of soldiers in khaki pass along fairly oftenAnd during the few days when it was my duty to meet trains at Victoria Stationno train from the South Coast either arrived or left without its quota of soldiersWe motored down to Portsmouth last Sundayand we were stopped at the entrance to the town and asked to prove that we were not GermansIt was not a very difficult taskPortsmouth is swarming with soldiersbut until we reached itthe only evidence of changed conditions was the strange absence of cyclists and motor cyclists on the roadsThe other day I was waiting on a street cornerI was going to cross over and buy a paper The papers bring out new editions all day longand in taxisonbuseswalking along the streetevery one is reading a paper Suddenly I heard someone shout my nameand there were Richard Aldington and FGFlintThey were in excellent spirits Richard Aldington had just been down to put his name on the roster of those willing to enlistFlint cannot enlisthe is already serving his country in the Post Officeand sits all day long in the most important and most dangerous building in the world next to the Bank of EnglandIt is guarded by soldiers and surrounded by bomb netsbut London is full of spies I thought of the exquisite and delicate work of these two men in the Anthologie Des Imagistesand it seemed barbarous that war should touch themas cruel and useless as the shattering of a Greek vase by a cannon ballI remembered the letters of Henri Régnault I had readlong agoI remembered how he gave up his studio in Algiers and came back to fight for Franceand died in the trenchesWe read of these thingsbut when we find ourselves standing on a street corner talking to two young poets who are preparing to face the same experiencesWell It is different This is one sideThere isunhappilyanotherSomething that one fearedand is not glad to seeThere is not that realization that there should be of the danger England is innor that rush to defend her that one associates with the English temperThey are not enlisting as they shouldand that is the bare truth of the matter And there is a certain hysteria beginning to showwhich is terribly un EnglishasEnglishhas hitherto beenThe appeal to men to enlist has become almost a scream of terrorThe papers are full of itin editorialsin letters from private personsAnd still the Government delays to declare general mobilizationInsteadit adopts measures which seem positively childishLord Kitchener asks the taxi cabs to carry placards urging enlistmentand when some of the union cab drivers refusethe papers solemnly urge a patriotic public to boycot the placardless cabsAnd all England is supposed to be under martial law Could anything be more miserably humorous It is hard to imagine Wellington asking favors of cabmenandwhen he was refusedbegging the populace to punish the offendersThe following advertisement in this morning s Times illustrates the enthusiasm and the apathy which are rife at the same timeDoctor s wifemiddle agedwill undertake to perform the work of any tramway conductorcoachmanshop assistantor other married worker with childrenprovided that worker will undertake to enlist and fight for his country in our hour of needAll wages earned will be paid over to the wife and family Apply MrsLowry1Priory terraceKew GreenS WPerhaps one of the saddest evidences of a changed England is MrHGWells s letter to Americans in The Chronicle of August 24thFor an Englishman to implore a foreign country to do or not to do anythingis newEnglishmen have not been used to beg weaklywith tears in their eyesWhatever one may think of MrWells s contention in this letterthe tone in which it is written is a lamentable evidence of panicPanic has never been an English traitand neither has whining servilityAnd the Americans are the last people in the world to be moved by itWe are a just peopleand we admire valorI think MrWells need not have stooped to ask us for justice or sympathyAfter allit purports little to point out the spots on the sunEngland is still the mother country of most Americanseven if that was a good while agoAnd we love herShe has given us not only our bloodbut our civilizationSince this war broke out she has harbored us and kept her ships running for usIn Parisone must get a permit from the police to stay or leaveIn Englandone is free and unmolestedEngland has always been the refuge of oppressed peoplesDoes she ned to ask our sympathy now that she isherselfoppressedNeutral we must beand neutral we shall bebut we are not a military nationand despotism can never attract usEvery American would rather a bungling democracy than the wisest despot who ever breathedThis condition has somewhat improved since above was written Cause

confess to a certain disappointment at this playNot that it is a bad playIt would be hard for Galsworthy to write badlyButboth dramatically and philosophicallyit might have been betterandjudging by Galsworthy s previous workcould easily have been betterJusticeStrife and The Pigeonfor instanceare immeasurably superior to this playThe theme of the play is the protest of an upper class statesman against a war of conquest with a small nation in which his country is engagedHis wife and family are all normally patriotic and his stand estranges themHis governmental position is lostas is also his parliamentary membershipSir Stephen More makes a magnificent stand for his idealHis courage and consistency result in his death at the hands of the victory drunken mobAnd yet I was left coldIt must have been my realization of the futility of his cause which killed my warmthand yet I am an admirer of forlorn hopes and their leadersIt wasperhapsmore the artificiality of his espousement of peaceand the grounds for this espousementwhich failed to move meTo begin withMore belongs to the class which really benefits by warthe moniedaristocratic and governing classTo such people patriotism is a natural and inevitable source of actionas it is rooted in their very substantial stake in the countryLove of the fatherlandwhich has given them so muchand the duty of fighting its warsor of encouraging others to fight themis a very vital and vigorous thing in themAgainst thisMore had nothing to advance but a very negative propaganda an appeal to the strong to acthonorablyby pitying and sparing the weaka perfectly sickening reasonand the invoking of a hazy abstract idea ofjusticewhich has about as much power to influence men s actions as a policeman has to maintain moralityMore was a member of the imperial class and he became aLittle Englander He was a member of a soldierly classand he became an advocate of peace for peace s sakeHe opposed a cloudy concept of conductutterly unrelated to the facts of life to a deep rooted instinct founded on the material benefit of his own classAnd this was the reason of his failureHe had nothing grippingly affirmative to give the peopleand he should have realized that to appeal to the rulers was hopelessA greatpopularfull blooded thing like war must have a greatpopularfull blooded thing to counteract itAlsowe must remember that the life of the masses of people is not such a beautiful and colored thing that death V on the battle field is such a very dreadful alternativePainting the horrors of war its sordid and unheroic side is not enoughNothing could be more sordid and unheroic than the gray existence of the factory handA newfull gospel of affirmationrevoltand militancy must be set against the war passionThe spirit of conflict is good it is essential to continuity it is the breaker of old forms and the releaser of new lifeIt canhoweverbe directed along newer and more gainful channels than that of international market strugglesThe people who can stop wars are the people who fight warsAnd they can stop them by the divinely simple method of refusing to fightand by refusing to provide foodclothingand transportation to any that do fightThe worker operates industry and can shut off supplies if he willAnyone who preserves a faith that the governors may end war is sustaininghimself with a strawBut if the peoplethe mass of producersare to stop warthey must first be stirred and a negative pacific preaching will never stir themOnly a call to a greater and more vital war can move themSuch a war existsIt is the hand to hand struggle against exploitationagainst the economic bondage which has fettered the minds and bodies of the larger portion of the race for ages pastThis conflict is affirmative it calls for courageenduranceand comradeshipAlso it is truebecause it has its roots in the biological basis of lifelove and hungerThe stir of passion is in it the passion of hate and the passion of loveand also the love of a good fight and without these elements there is no war worth the whileBut all thisit seemsMore did not realizeAndhad he realized ithe could have done but littleHe was too removed from themobto speak their tonguetoo far from them to share their feelingtoo alien for his words to gain a foothold in the crannies of their beingThe mob that killed More had made Moreand all others of his kindThe despised mob had fought his battles on the field of war and on the field of industryFor the one they killed they had nurtured thousandsInchoate and all but inarticulatein this mob is the divine stuff out of which shall be formed the master people to comewhen once they decide to fight their own war instead of that of their task mastersNothingnot even conventional virtueis so provincial as conventional vice and the desire to bewilder the middle classes is itself middle classArthur SymondsThe Little Review Ante Bellum Russia ALEXANDER SKAUN The effects that the European War will haveand is having already on the internal conditions in Russia are merely conjecturableconsidering the fact that since the first week in August we have had no sterling news from the embroiled countriesI believe that a study of the pre war situation in Russiaof her recent moods and aspirationswill enable us to venture a guess or two as to the potential results of the present imbroglioThe forthcoming is by no means an attempt to exhaust the problemit is barely a bird s eye view of contemporary Russian reality as reflected in life and literatureI In a recent article an eminent Russian publicist thus characterizes the modern literature of his native land It is quite clear With the death of Tolstoy our literature also expiredNot orphanedbereaved it diedcame to an endperishedIn factwhat does our modern literature teach usIt positively preaches all the instinctsthe completecredoof the bestialized criminalSelf despitesacrilegesexual licentiousnesspolitical mutinycommendation of crimehooliganish all negationstalest individualismmorals of an outlawthe ideology of fratricide Cainthe codex of an apache and Jack the RipperTaking the above philippic cum grano saliswe musthoweverconsider it as a characteristic phenomenon illustrating the contemporaneous moods of Russian society in the process of its prolonged morbid crisisFor if literature is supposed to be the mirror of lifeif in literature we find the true reflection of a people s feelingscravingsidealsstruggles then Russia presents the most vivid demonstration of this truthIn no other country has literature reflected real life with such a consequential and accurate preciseness as has that of the land of the Czar in all its epochs and stagesIfthereforethe modern Russian literature has a morbid aspectif its heroes preach adulterycrimefree loveand praise the lowest mob instinctsif it doesand to a large extent it unquestionably does represent a base degradationthen we must needs look into the very life of that unhappy country in search for the causes of its mental afflictionthensomething is the matterwith holy RussiaII As a pendant to the quoted jeremiadI shall cite another distinguished Russian publicistwhose keen observation equals his absolute truthfulnessA filthy torrent flows over wide Russiaa torrent of savagenessbloodthirstinesscrueltysexual wantonnessintoxicated cynicismThe torrent overflows and deluges and infects all spots of life and ruins the soul of the nationThe manthe person is of no value or considerationThere is no self respect nor respect for othersThe provoked instincts know of no hold backThe sexual passion intermingles with the passion to torture and to tyrannizeThe atmosphere is veiled in a bloody fogThe venom has penetrated all overthrough all ranks of the populationBloody and shameful deeds have become an every day occurrence not only among the higher societyarmy

tediousby GodAnd thecitizenlays aside the paper with a dull yawnSuch is life in that strange countryand consequently such is its literaturelife s mirrorits product and interpretationIII The definition of Russian literature as Heroic was perfectly true until a few years agoThe literaturelike the life itselfhad been a continuous heroismThe harder the oppressions from abovethe more resolute was the fighting spirit below the wilder the reaction that raged over the throbbing countrythe loftier were the ideals of the struggling people the more acute the sufferings of the gloomy presentthe brighter and the more attractive appeared the perspectives of the futureEver since the first revolutionary outbreak in 1825the so called Insurrection of the Decembriststhe Russian populace has had one great idealone ardent all embracing aimthe overthrow of the autocracythe impersonification of evilinjusticeand tyrannyThis goal has been the sense of lifethe justification of man s existencethe holy spirit elevating and purifying the miserable subjects of the Czarthe solace for the eternal humiliationthe compensation for the unique martyrdom of that unfortunate nationA greatan inestimable rôle has been played by Russian literature in the education of the publicThough restricted by draconic rules of the bigoted state censorshipit succeeded in speaking to the public in an Aesopic tonguetraining the readers in the gentle art of understanding between the linesIt preached idealismself sacrificeunbounded devotion and love to their suffering compatriotsand unlimited deadly hatred for the common foethe TyrantThe elevating influence of that idealistic literature has been displayed most manifestly upon Russian youthparticularly upon university studentsThe susceptible young souls followed the call of their great teachers and guidesand plunged with zeal and ardor into the battleSelfishnesslife s diversions and conventionalities had no place in their puritanic mindsTo fight for freedom was their onlysportto enlighten the massestheir soleamusementto die on the scaffold for the Idealthe climax of happinessIn that enduring bitter struggle there have been but two sidestwo antagonistic

ocean of lofty idealsspiritual forcesgreat hopesboundless altruismNoblesse obligeThe great common cravings and aims must needs have cultivated a high standard of morals and intercourse among the peopleThe able correspondent of The London Daily ChronicleHenry WNevinsonwho had had the opportunity of closely observing Russian life during the unforgettable red years of 1905 1906justly remarkedTo have a cause like thatthe Revolution to dwell with danger for the sake of it every day and nightto confront an enemyvitalpitilessalmost omnipotentand execrable beyond wordswhat other cause can compare to thatnot only in grandeurbut in the satisfaction of intellect and courage and love and every human facultySo tyranny brings its compensationsIV The general strike and uprising of October1905compelled the obstinate Czar togranta tolerable constitutionIt seemed that the long struggle had come to an endthat the desired goal having been reachedthe bitterly fought for concession having been attainedthere was no reason for continuing the bloody war between the government and the peopleThe Manifesto of 3017October1905pledged liberty of speechpressand public meetingsequal rights for alland a representative government with a comparatively liberal election systemOnly those who happened to abide in Russia during the autumn months of 1905 are able to comprehend the indescribable joy of the population at the announcement of the ManifestoAn intoxication of happiness reigned all over the countrystrangers embraced and kissed each othereveryone was addressed with the heartycomrade a sincere feeling of brotherhood and mutual love overfilled all heartsand from Finland to farthest SiberiaThe Little Review from the polar regions to the Black Seaover the entire vast empire thundered the exalted cry Long live liberty The enchantmenthoweverwas of a short durationThe people soon found out that they had put too much confidence in the paper pledge of the Czarand that they should not have laid their weapons asideThe solemn promise declared from the heights of the throne was brokenOne after one the pledged liberties were taken awayand a wave of brutal repression and massacre swept over the tormented landOnly too late one could recollect with the American Russologue Joubertthe ever new aphorism of BertrandThe tree of liberty can grow only when it is watered with the blood of the tyrants The government recovered its senses after the first collapseand decided to play its game on the obscurity and ignorance of the armyThe simpleminded soldiersthemselves miserable peasants or workingmenwere ordered to shoot and flog their fathers and brotherstheir friends and defendersand they fulfilled their official duty with incomparable brutalityThe revolution was betrayed and strangledIts leaders were shothangedor banished the free press shut upliberal parties and meetings forbiddenand once more the monster bureaucracy held in its claws the palpitating unhappy landV Let us return to the problem What is the matter with Russia What is the cause of its general decay and demoralization The revolution proved a failureThe massesthe army particularlywere unprepared for carrying out the long cherished idealBut that was not allThe Russian revolutionary movement has been used to failures and temporary collapsesthe organizations have been destroyed and abolished many a timeand yet like a Phoenix they would arise from out the ashes and manifest their significant existence again and againThe causeto all appearanceslies with the modernized system applied by the bureaucracy in its war with the people the demoralization of the peopleWhat Nicolas Icould not attain through his iron despotism what Alexander IIIfailed to accomplish by means of crudest oppressions and restrictions carried through by such arch tyrants as PobyedonostzevDTolstoyMuravyovetcwhat had been beyond the reach of Nicolas IIduring the dictatorships of his genial assistants of the type of Plehvethe hero of Kishinevor General Trepovthe man of Bloody SundayJanuary1905 this important point was won by the gentleman butcherthe hangman in the frock coatthe late premier StolvpinThe credit for having succeeded in breaking the spirit of the nation and for having brought it to the verge of demoralization is largely due to his policyT o accomplish a coup d etatto abolish the Douma and reinstall the old order of thingswas the easiest attainable measure for Stolypin at the time The Little Review of his appointment to the highest post in the stateThe opposition was silenced by military forcethe servile European financiers renewed their enormous credit to thepacifiedCzardom which had been on the brink of bankruptcyand it seemed an obvious step to declare urbi et orbi the successful restoration of the ancient autocracyBut MrStolypin was a politician of Bismarck s schoolHe loathed the laurels of a Pyrrhic victoryThe rich experience of his ill famed predecessors had taught him that the more harshly he suppressed the opposition the deeper it would grow and develop in theUndergroundthat the closer he stopped up the yawning crater the more intense and terrible would be the inevitable explosionA complete return to the old regime would again unite the entire nation within and the civilized world from without in common hatred for the outworn Asiatic despotyInstead the shrewd premier chose the old Caesarean maximDivide et imperaTo incite racial hatred among the heterogeneous strata of the one hundred and thirty millions population to provoke the meanest mob instincts and to flatter the lowest chauvinistic sentiments to create mutual ill feelings in all ranks of society by various provocative means to incarnate espionage in the national life as a virtue to corrupt and prostitute all state institutionsso as to kill every sense of confidence in the mercenary justice and respect for all authorities to arrest intellectual progress by barring and banishing the best professorsby forbidding enlightenment organizationsby distracting young minds from social problems through unscrupulous patronage of nationalistic societies in the high schools and universitiesofeasy amusementsand all but clean sports to augment crude force to the degree of absolute right and sole lawthese have been the chief strategic measures of the modernized absolutismIt is true that a similar coursealthough on a considerably smaller scalehas been pursued by the Russian government all through the nineteenth centuryThe originality of Stolypin s methods and of those of his less original successors lies in their up to datenesstheir quasi modernismtheir pseudo constitutionalismtheir hypocritical JesuitismActually Russia represents the same old Asiatic despotism as of olden daysOfficiallyhoweverit wears with a clumsy awkwardness the European frockcoat of parliamentarismIt is a modern Januswith an artificial human expression towards the outside worldand with its natural primitive bestial front at homeThe Doumathe long cherished ideal of the peoplewas transformed from a house of representatives into an ante room of the governmentinto a shameful profanation of parliamentarismThe first two Doumas gave an overwhelming opposition to the governmentand the latter found an easy way to get rid of its disagreeable opponents by dissolving the Assemblies and suing the deputies as rebelsThe unscrupulous Senate issued a series ofmodificationsto the electoral lawsand thus insured for the later Doumas adesirableelementHaving deprived the majority of the populace of voting rightsgiving all means of assistance and protection to theBlack Hundreds criminal societies nourishing under the standard of patriotismterrifying the average voter and driving him into political absenteeismthe government succeeded in gaining a majority of obsequious manikins who have sold the people for a pottage of lentils and have debased the Douma to a purely instrumental force in the hands of StolypinampCoEven the moderate liberals of the type of Professor Paul Milyoukov or Prince Eugene Troubetzkoywho have been ardent supporters of the Douma as a means of educating the people on constitutional ideas even they are gradually losing their rosy expectationsRepresentative Maklakova man to whom even the late Stolypinhis bitterest antagonistpaid the highest respectin his

strongshe began to flutter hither and thitherfrom flower to flowera winged dream flitting as perfumes called herfrom dream to dreamAt lastwhen the dark fingers of the night were clutching at the fieldsfrom the brief stillness of twilight arose a brief summer stormOnly a few puffs of wind ruffled the grassonly a few growls of thunder silenced the birdsonly a few warm drops of rain pattered among the treesThen the storm passed and the sun shone over the wet earth as a sweetheart shines through her tears with promise of pardonBut the warm wind had blown the butterfly against a twigso that her wings were broken and the soft summer rain had crushed her to the earthso that she diedBut there had been one passingwhose dreams were in musicand he had felt her beauty in his ownAnd he spun a

rumors of sorrow they returned and stood in a row before her with averted facesWhen she had heard their fearsshe thanked themand going down from the housetopshe sought a hidden chamber where she could

heart of man Thou hast made us for Thyself and the heart is restless until it rests in Thee said Augustine long agoIndeedGod is but another human name for Eternal YearningAll yearning is lovelove that silently and secretly celebrates its triumphal entry into the soulIf you stood at the grave of a joy and felt pain over that which was lostwould not the pain of yearning be the measurethe consciousnessof your newly awakenedever waking loveWould you like to calculate this yearning and exchange therefor coldness and indifference of heartAnd if you felt a love so full and deep that moments had eternities concealed in themeven soon the basis of this love yearning would live more than everit would open up to the soul new vistasnew goalsit would give love her life and a love without yearningwhich did not see beyond itselfdid not love above itselffinished in that which it wasor it called its ownwould quickly cease to be loveYesyearning redoubles all genuine love to man it involves something becomingsomething greaterpurerfor which love lays the foundation and gives the impulseOnly he who knows yearningknows what I loveso Mignon might have also saidThere is something unslakedunslakablein every lovean insatiable hunger for more lovefor better and purer loveIt is this yearning that saves love from being blind it gives love the strength and courage of veraciousness it plunges the heart into a struggle of desperation when a man of our love does not keep his promisewhen he becomes pettier and baser than we had believed of him and yet in this struggle it achieves the victory of faith which mounts above all the pettiness and baseness of the manto the certainty of its strengththat love faileth neverIn every love we love something higher than itselfsomething for which the heart is destined and endowedThis is the yearning in our lovea willwhich stirs in all deep feeling of the heartand guards against the death which every momentsufficient only for itselfharborsEvery lovethereforeis itself a yearninglove for truth is the power to grow beyond a truth love for righteousness is hunger and thirst after righteousnessIn all the beauty that greets the eye and awakens exultation and joy in the heartthe soul ripens new sensitivity for new visions of the wonders of lifethe heart widens so that it absorbs strength for new beauty and sees new beauty even in the darkness and dust of earthA man without yearning is a man without loveAnd if one would guarantee man that satisfaction which one prizes as the most beautiful and most blissful lot on earththen one must first stifle his heart or tear it from his breast for as long as this heart still beatsand announces in every beat its insatiable hunger for loveso long will the man harbor and feel his yearningwhich will not let the beating heart be satisfiedBut yearning is therefore not simply sufferingnot simply loveof these we have been thinkingit is also lifethe true life of manThe man who lives only for himselfand for the passing momentdoes not live at allAnd this is what Nietzsche says of manman a transition and an end yearning always interring an Oldalways swinging a bridge across to

The Viennese Dramatists ERNA MCARTHUR One does not know quite how the modern literary movement in Vienna aroseSuddenlysome twenty years agothere were some active young writers calledYoung Vienna in a collective waywho were supposed to be revolutionary and bent on originalityIn reality these young people had no definite literary program such as had been issued in Berlin by the leaders of the new naturalist movementThey were a circle of friendswho had heard of the new and wonderful things that had been doneThey came to know Ibsen and the great Russian and French novelists they were of the generation which was to be moved to the utmost by the philosophy of NietzscheOf course these influences had been working in the whole German speaking worldArt was being taken seriously again and the young people were yearning to produce something new and original of their ownHauptmann had started a kind of revolution in Germany by his first playBefore Sunriseand the Viennesewho lived a little isolated in their towngrew excited and enthusiastic over these doingsA young writerHermann Bahrwas a kind of apostle for the new art in ViennaHe was a man of agilitycapable of unbounded enthusiasmwho could go into ecstasy for all kinds of movementsfor realism as well as neo romanticismfor Ibsen and Zolafor Maeterlinck and d AnnunzioHe had been traveling about in Europehad come in touch with all the leading personalitiesand had brought the news home to his Viennese friends he wanted to make a new Vienna in every wayA few years later he was active in organizing the young painterssculptorsand architectswho evolved a very original and striking artSo it came to pass that Hermann Bahr was considered the leader of everything modernwhich meantcrazyto the good citizen of the dayIt was this same milieu of the citizenthe bourgeoisthat produced all the young writersIn consequencethey were absolutely anti bourgeois in their way of looking at thingsin the very natural contrast of fathers and sonsHencetoothey had a certain culturegood mannersand a predominant interest in aesthetic questionsas there had been no occasion for them to know the primitive cares of lifeBut they were tired of the narrowness and tastelessness of their milieu they wanted to do things differentlyto live and love differentlyto put art into their surroundingstheir dwellingstheir dress good tastethis had been a tradition of the old Viennalost in the transition state when the middle class element obtained its precedence over the old aristocracywas now to take its place againApart from the dislike of these Viennese young men for the bourgeoisie The Little Review there were really very few positive tendencies that could join them into a groupConsequently very different artistic individualities developedArthur Schnitzler and Hugo von Hofmannsthalthe two most representativehave very little in common in their workBut there was a spirit of friendship among all of them they liked to meet in the caféswhich had always been Vienna s center of social lifeand to talk things overthe lightest and the deepestA certain café used to be famous as the center of the young literary worldThe old people who didn t like the whole business called it the café of the crazy self worshipperssomething to that effect and this title has stuck to it sinceTodaythe house has been demolishedits glory has passedbut there are still legends and stories told of the wonderful talkthe hot and breathless debates that once filled these rooms from morning till nightand till morning againIn all this there was no real rebellion against any local literary traditionThe great Austrian writers of the past always held their own places but the great dramatists did not reign on the stage of that dayIt was nearly exclusively devoted to the French salon playDumasAugierand their German imitatorsNaturally a generation which looked for the true and real in art could not have much in common with theseBut there were certainly some features in Grillparzer and Anzengruber felt as congenial by the modernsGrillparzer had possessed a sensuous softnessa musical beauty of language foreign to the contemporary North GermanThus an element of color and lightthe soul of modern impressionism entered in his creationsbreaking through the severe contours characteristic of his generationthough in general he set great value on the strict architectonic upbuild of his dramasIn his tragedy of Hero and Leander perhaps the warmest love tragedy ever written in the German languagea strongly realistic description of Viennese type is hidden among the Greek clothingHeroconsecrated priestesswho forgets her vows when she sees Leanderfirst full of reservethen letting herself go in a full passionmight be the grandmother of Schnitzler s sweet girl out of the suburbHere she wears a charming Greek dressher lonely tower stands on the seashoreand her loverLeandermust swim through the whole Hellespont to reach herThe modern poet makes it easier for his heroes the tower gets to be a little room in a Viennese suburb and a walk in the twilight through a few quiet streets brings him to his goal without much exertion And so you might find other parental traits between the two Austrians There is a melancholy strain in Grillparzer s personality and work which Schnitzler seems to have inheritedSide by side with the light mindedness and ease of the Austriana certain tired melancholy and resignation seem to dwellThis sounds through many creations of Austrian artistsWe hear it in Schubert s music and feel it in the charming plays of Ferdinand Plaimundwho saw the harmony only in an upper sphere of fairies and magiciansThe Little Review whereas the life of the human beings seemed tumultuous and disordered to himAustria did not make it easy for her gifted childrenand Grillparzer suffered all his life in his official careerIt oppressed him and warped his creative powerLudwig Anzengruber had to suffer under the same disadvantagesbut he had a greater fund of good humor to set against itHe was a man of vigor and lebensbejahungaffirmation of life Anzengruber was called the herald of naturalism and the Berlin people counted him as one of their numberproducing his plays together with those of Ibsen and Hauptmann on the Berlin Free StageAnzengruber applied the heightened sense for reality characteristic of modern artbe it called naturalistic or neo romanticto his own work and introduced a new material to the dramaThe peasant story had been treated up to now in a moralizing wayThe idyl of country innocence was to be shown and towns people were to see the purer heart s sentiment under the dirtier shirtsAnzengruber showed the peasants in their realityneither better nor worseHis fingers are unnatural and stiff in representing types of the cultured classes speaking the literary Germanhis peasant types are of wonderful vitalityThere is the old stone cutter who has thought out a deep pantheistic philosophyHe relates it in his simple wayhow it all came to himhow he was lonelypoorlying in his cottage up in the mountainshow he saw the sun lying on the meadow and wanted to live in the sunshinenot in his miserable hut when he felt near dyingAnd thenout in the sunny meadowit comes to him like a revelation that he is not really illnot really poorbecause nothing can happen to himbecause everything around belongs to him and he belongs to everythingThis deep pantheistic feeling expressed in this unpathetic way gives him from now on a perfect good humor not to be disturbedHe goes among the peasants looking on at their quarrelings and grumblings and helps them out of their worst plights in a good natured waybut without bothering them in the least with his philosophy or any tendency toward improving them or the world in generalAnzengruberwith such religious views as he expressed herehad to be opposed to the Catholicism in which he was brought upHe fights against the clericalism which was weighing so heavily on the peasantsHe could feel their needsforthough he was born in Vienna and lived there nearly all his lifethere was more country than town blood in his veinsThis connects him closer with Hauptmannthe Silesianso deeply influenced in his art by home environmentthan with any of the young Austrian writers who were all born in the big towns and did not know what firm rooting in the soil meansAnzengruber s traditions could not be followed by them and there is the greatest contrast between his strong energtic work and the daintytenderdelicate things produced by Schnitzler as the first product of the young Viennese school just a year after Anzengruber s deathThis was The Little Review Anatala little work full of gracecharmand playfulnessThe loose

passive part it simply came to be the scene of actionthe meeting place of all different impressionsPeople of the earlier time had been expressionists who projected their own ego into the outward worldwhereas now they held themselves open to new impressionsobserved them and their effect on the I and then reproduced their observations in artistic formImpressionismpredominant in painting at that timehad taken hold of literatureOf coursethis passivity could only be a stage of transitionbecause each artistic individuality tends from the passive to the activebut this impressionism was a good means of assimilating all the new possibilities in the inside and outside worldSchnitzlerborn as the son of a famous Viennese physicianand prepared to be a physician himselfwas trained to observeHe

of passionthe end of life itselfBut this permanent thought of deathnot searching beyond the limits of this earthgives a new intensity to the enjoyment of this life while it lastsThis feeling for lifefor the simple joy of breathingof seeing the spring once moreis one of Schnitzler s most elementary conceptionsYou may look at any of his plays and find this truethe call of Lifeexpressed with the utmost intensityA young girl hears the call of lifeshe is fettered to the bedside of her ill father who never lets her out of his sightShe must stay with himalwayswithout the smallest pleasureand suddenly she hears that the man she lovesa young officer whom she has seen only oncewhen she has danced in his arms a whole night longmust away to the war never to returnShe can stand it no longershe

through field and meadowYou pluck the wayside flowers and you talk with me here under the brightfriendlymidThe Little Review 33 day skyAnd this is livingnot less than it was on that night when your darkened youth beckoned you toward gloomy adventureswhich still today appear to you to be the last word of your beingAnd who knowsif latermuch lateron a day like todaythe call of the living will not cry within you much deeperand purerthan on that day in which you have lived through things which are called by such terrible and glowing names as murder and love The whole play seems to be written for the sake of the last beautiful wordsIt is Schnitzler s greatest art to lift us to a sphere where everything seemingly important is solvedwhere tragedy and melancholy and sadness melt together into a wonderful serenityHis technique is full of subtletyevery little word and gesture has its placeits importance we feel the weight of the smallest happeningthe reality of a seemingly unmeaning factthe deep consequence of a hasty wordThe milieu was nearly always ViennaHere his over culitvatedrefined men were at homehere his soft and loving womenAll the several circlesartistocratsartistsphysiciansbusiness menfurnished material for his work and even more than the peoplethe town itself grew to lifeThe elegant vivaciousness of the inner citywhere the fashionable society meets at certain hours and fashionable little shops line the streetsthe lonely little streets of the suburbthe wonderful charm of the Wiener Wald embracing the town with its soft rounded linesall this rich flowering beauty that had surrounded him from childhood he gathered in his workPerhaps more forcibly than any one else he brought Vienna s charm to our consciousnessAnd so he returned to Vienna what he had received from herOnly two of his plays are outside the Viennese milieuThe Green Cockatooa grotesque that puts us marvelously well in the Parisian atmosphere shortly before the outbreak of the French Revolution and Beatrice s Veila Renaissance drama which tempted almost every artist in those daysThis epoch s refinementthe powerful personalities peopling itthe intensity concentrated on the enjoyment of their lifein all this they saw something akin to their own life s idealSchnitzler s plays have nothing of the fresco they are more like Manet s small landscapes with their richness of color and their soft contours diffused in lightHe made one attempt at a drama in bigunusually bigdimensionsIt takes about six hours to perform on the stagelonger than the second part of Goethe s Faustit is a historic play of the Napoleonic time called The Young Medardousbut the Emperor himself remains in the background and only his shadow lies on the eventsThese take place in Vienna at the time that Napoleon had reached Austria on his triumphal march and resided for the time in Schonbrunthe Hapsburg s castle near ViennaThe Viennese people as a mass are characterizedthes people so easily movedso easily influencedgrowing enthusiastic now for Napoleonnow in a hasty patriotic emotion for their own Emperorprincipally wanting one thingto see some exciting spectacleto hear newsto speak over interesting happeningsThe broadest part of the drama is occupied by a love episode between the hero Medardusa cousinif not a brother of Anatolonly about a hundred years backand the beautifulproudcold Duchess of Valoiswho is in Vienna to intrigue against Napoleonclaiming the right to the French throne for herself and her own familyThe work is full of beautiful and interesting episodesbut there is not enough architectonic power to join them together to a unityIt is too early to view Schnitzler in a historic wayhe is fifty years old and in the middle of his work certainly he signified much for his own generationfor they felt themselves understood by him and he influenced and even formed their attitude and feelingWhether his figures have enough of the timelessnessof the deepfull rounded humanity which will give them power to speak to future generations I do not knowIn a mood of paradoxical humorSchnitzler himself criticised his own creation more severely than any critic couldW e see a marionettestheater on the stage the public thereeager for the play the marionettes appearall Schnitzler s own figures the complicated herothe sweet girlthe demonic womanand so onThe poet is therefull of excitementThe marionettes are to give his new playbut there is a rebellionThe marionettes want to do what pleases themlive their own lifeIn the midst of confusiona mysterious man appears on the stage with a long naked sword in his hand he cuts through the threads the marionettes fall in a heapThe poet askshalf gratefulhalf bewildered Who are you But the unknown man cannot tell himhe is an enigma to himselfHe wanders through the world and his sword makes it apparent who only is a dollwho a manSchnitzler doomed his figures with more severity to the fate of dolls than is due themThe second Viennese writer whose name became known beyond the town s limits is Hugo von HofmannsthalHe is a very different person from Schnitzler both have the sensitiverefinedexclusively aesthetic valuation of things in commonBut what was expressed more naively in Schnitzler came to be a program with HofmannsthalHe joined a group of men with a strictArt for Art s sakeprogramexclusive and intended only for the fewThe principal of this group was Stefan Georgea lyric poet who had fashioned the German language into poems of such beauty of form as to rival the poetry of the French lyricistslike Baudelaire or VerlaineIt was an art that irritated people somewhatlike that of the Cubists and FuturistsIt was extremely hard to understand the sense organs were mixed upas he spoke of sounding colorsfragrant tonesand colored soundsHofmannsthalwith a great feeling for language and formgrew to be his followerThe Little Review 35 These poets called themselves Neo Romanticistsbecause their art was crowded full of symbolsThe older Ibsenwith his symbolic worldMaeterlinckwith his mysterious little playswere their models with these the great artists of formSwinburne and d AnnunzioIt was an eclecticmuch traveled typeassimilating old and modern cultures equally wellHugo von Hofmannsthal is characteristic of the type of the aesthetewith a rather priestlyexclusive bearing still found today frequently in GermanyThese were no more the old Bohemians with a preference for a deranged toilette and way of livingbut elegant young getnlemen who liked to appear in frock coats with ties and waistcoats fabulously gay of colorAlsoin their surroundings their liking went to the utmost refinement and luxuryThey loved the dignifiedthe sensationalthe sonorousHugo von Hofmannsthal certainly blessed his parents for giving him a well soundingsonorous nameHe had a great talent as a lyricistand as an essayistwith the finest understanding for all foreign cultures as long as they responded to something in his own soulHis dramas are not in any way related to ViennaHe perused all history s epochs and took the material for his dramas from the Orientout of the Italian Renaissancehis favorite epoch and the classic art of the GreekMany of his plays are not intended as original creationsbut arrangements of older worksSo he did with an old pre Shakespearean English play by Thomas Otway and with the old mystery play EverywomanSome of his little plays are lovelythe death of Titian gives a vision of the dead extravagance of Venice equalled by few modern productionsHis most interesting attempt is an arrangement of Elektra for the modern stageHis Greeks are barbarouswildfull of unbroken primitive instinctsThey are under the influence of an extreme nervous hysteriaNietzsche had spoken of the Greek hysteriawhich slumbered under their apparent serenityHofmannsthal put a picture of horror on the stage that keeps the spectator spellbound from the first to the last minuteThrough the concentration in one act this intensity is still increasedSince Richard Strauss put Elektra into musicHofmannsthal has devoted his art entirely to this composerHis last works are written as libretti for Strauss operasand go through the world now in the wake of his musicFinallyI would like to tell of a strange Viennese personalityno dramatistbut just as little a novelistepic or lyric poetThe name of this manwho cannot be put into any of the ordinary literary compartmentsis Peter AltenbergHe thought that most of the things told in dramas of fiveor

in colleges on the same general basis that we believe in many other disciplinesit is impossible ever to learn too much on any subjectBut we know there is something seriously wrong with the collegesand a far graver danger than philistinization seems to us to lie in that hysterical confusion of values which causes our college students to see small things as big ones and to let the big ones slip

othersMrHaywood wishes to showby this publicationthe spirit of art which is manifesting itself in the working class movementHe maintains that the heightened consciousness of the workers is beginning to express itself through an adequate and distinctive poetical mediumNew York Letter GEORGE SOULEEASTERN publishers have been much amused by the advertising of The Eyes of the World spread over full pages of the recent magazinesThe burden of the appeal to the public isfirstthat we have been overrun with immoral books secondthat clergymeneditorsand all other forces of decency are powerless to stop the flood thirdthat MrHarold Bell Wright has sprung to the front as the great leader against the vicious influence of the other writers by the production of his latest novel and fourththat the whole battle will be won if the public will step into the nearest bookshop and pay1 35 net for MrWright s bookFrom the glowing moral tone of the advertisement one might think it the work of an uplift committee but in small type at the bottom is a copyright notice bearing the name of the president of MrWright s publishing houseThis gentleman is undoubtedly deeply sincere in his admiration of MrWright s work and its influencebut in this case his admiration has led him to a somewhat ingenuous confusion of moral and business motivesIt reminds one of the tactics of the billboard advertising men whowhen they discovered that billboard advertising was being strongly attacked by those who object to the disfigurement of our countrysideput up a large number of biblical posters to curry favor with simple religious soulsand were afterwards so injudicious as to boast of their cleverness in Printer s InkThe effectiveness of MrWright s plea is somewhat prejudiced by his own caseHis novel sets forth the thesis that in order to make an artistic or literary success it is necessary only to resort to flattery and corruptionBut his own novels have for some years been far more popular than those of most competitorsIs it pure perversity that makes his hated rivals reject his obviously successful methods in favor of the despicable ones which he so vehemently attacksWe wish only that someone with an equal enthusiasm for artistically moral literature would try a similar advertising campaign for a genuine artistSuch advertisements might set forth the facts that the bookshops are being overrun with mediocre novels which make successes by pandering to untruth and public prejudicethat the work of genius is in danger of being choked out by the insincere product of commercial writersand that the best way to promote the interests of good literature would be to buy in large quantities the novels of John Galsworthy or Romain Rolland Butalassuch a campaign is impossible in a commercial democracyit wouldn t payThe Little Review A respectable number of the best publishers have already aroused themselves to the improprietyor at least to the eventual ineffectiveness of announcing extreme praises of their own publications even in the critical veinSurely the book reading public can t be made to believe that four or fivegreat novelsare issued every yearSurely they would be grateful for a little genuine information about the books they are asked to buyAnd so these publishers have issued for two years a monthly circular entitled New Bookswhich contains descriptions of important new publications without praise of any kindIt would be telling tales out of school to say how carefully the publisherscopy writers must be watched in order to prevent them from slipping dubious phrases into their notesSome advertising men seem to have principles against giving any candid information about what they have for saleBut the task has been accomplished so farand it remains to be seen whether this civilized form of advertising can make much progress against the advertising vandalism which destroys the effectiveness of all publicity by extravagant statementsOne begins to suspect that the effort is pitifully Utopian in a state of economic savagery like the presentwhere every man s attention is more naturally directed to his profits than to the honesty of his workThe chances would be better if the majority of the public knew what intellectual honesty is and really wanted itThere is hope among the magazines in the form of The MetropolitanThat is making a commercial success and is also attempting to publish genuine worknot necessarilyhighbrow but at least genuineAn expert on an important subject recently wished to write a magazine articleThe first editor he approached recast the material to suit his own ideasA second and a third told him that his message was goodbut over the heads of the publicthey orderedpopularand ephemeral trivialitiesThe Metropolitan is the only magazine that wanted him to writein his own waywhat he really had to sayAnother writer submitted the outline of an article to a Metropolitan editorIt was on a subject ordinarily considered somewhatdangerous The editor saidThat is newand interestingIt ought to make a good articleYou must be careful of only one thingBe absolutely frankDon t try to gloss over anything that is a plain matter of fact Such directness is astounding to one accustomed to the ways of editorsAn editor has recently confessed to me that now for the first time he begins to believe that the popular magazines may have a really good reason for existenceaside from furnishing amusement in hours of train and family boredomHe thinks that the tremendous events in Europe are likely to bring forth literature of worth and quickened emotion which nevertheless cannot wait for book publicationand that so we shall find use for the more ephemeral mediumIt certainly is true that the keen public interest in the war is likely to decline even before the war is overWe are bound to experience a reaction in favor of reading matter at the opposite pole of thoughtAn incredible rumor that Hearst has bought The Atlantic Monthly is as startling as many of the war headlines which occur when no authentic news is availableIn spite of the absurdity of the ideait has possibilities of momentary amusementWhat a retribution

Charles BoniNew York I am very sorry indeed that this book arrived when most of our space was pre emptedI need room for the sort of appreciation that I feel for these poemsThat extraordinarydelightfuland Quixotic institutionThe Glebewhich insists on publishing stuff on its meritsapart from considerations of popularityhas had divine luck in finding Cronyn whoever he isFor Cronyn is a poetNot just a versifierbut a poetHis verse has a facility which does not detract from its beautyI have encountered sheer beauty more often in his book than in any volume of modern poetry that I have read for some timeHere is a sample Clouds Whence do you comeoh silken shapesAcross the silver skyWe come from where the wind blows And the young stars dieWhy do you move so fastso fast Across the white moon s breastThe cruel wind is at our heels And we may not restAre you not wearyfleeing shapesThat never cease to fleeThe forked tree s chained shadows are Less weary than weThe Little Review 41 Whither do you goO shadow shapesAcross the ghastly skyWe go to where the wind blows And the old stars dieThis is just a short and rather exuberant message to LITTLE REVIEW readersbecause I think they really deserve the pleasure of discovering Cronyn for themselvesSongs for the New Ageby James Oppenheim The Century CompanyNew York One of the phenomena of the evolution of man is the constant broadening of consciousnessWe become accustomed to the sharing of our feelings with larger and larger numbers of peopleour identity with the race and even with inanimate thingsbecomes increasingly plain to us through both the findings of science and heightened emotional receptivityAnd yet this wider consciousness by no means lessens the value or quality of personalityBy a splendid paradoxthe more we realize our inseparability with all life the more does our selfhood become accentuatedThus is achieved the marriage of Democracy and IndividualismWe find thatin the endthe cultivation of one is the nourishing of the otherI need hardly mention that I am not alluding to that similacrum of equality political democracyThis must be known to appreciate the message of James OppenheimFor it is pre eminently as a message that these poems should be treatedThey are of essential value as one of the most articulate efforts to translate that which in most people is muteThere is an unmistakable kinship with Whitman in this worknot merely in the formwhich is here termedpolyrhythmic but in the spiritwithout hint of plagiarism or of abject imitationAlso we have the same breezy contempt for the petty trappings of civilizationHere is an extract from the poemTasting the Earthwhich has beauty as well as truth O dark great mother globe so close beneath mewas she with her inexhaustible griefof blood drenched junglesand the smoking of cratersand the roar of tempestsmoan of the forsaken seaswas she with the hills beginning to walk in the shapes of the dark hearted animalswas she risendashing away tears and praying to dumb skiesin the pompcrumbling tragedy of manIt was shecontainer of all griefsand the buried dust of broken heartsCry of the christs and the lovers and the child stripped mothersAnd ambition gone down to defeatand the battle overborneAnd the dreams that have no wakingMy heart became her ancient heart On the food of the strong I fedon dark strange life itselfWisdom giving and somber with the unremitting love of agesThere was dank soil in my mouthAnd bitter sea on my lipsIn a dark hourtasting the EarthThis is enough to make one grateful to MrOppenheimBut not always plays the cosmic symphony sometimes the spheric strains relax for a few slender lyrics to a moving picture lady or for the tender song to Anniethe working girlWe

personality may seem exaggerated praiseIf soI have no apology to offerI only ask thatuntil you have read the lecturespoemsstoriesand sketches which this book contains you will suspend judgmentVoltairine de Cleyre belonged to the school of thinkers that has suffered most from the misrepresentations and misunderstanding of the unthinking crowdthe school which numbers among its adherents men like StirnerIbsenandin some aspects of his teachingNietzschethe school The Little Review 43 that sees hope of social regeneration only in the sovereignty of the individual and the total abolition of the stateShe belonged to it because she was at once logician and poetwith a temperament abnormally rebellious against tyranny and an imagination abnormally responsive to every form of sufferingIt has often been remarked that anarchism takes root most readily in those minds that have endured most oppressionThus Russiathe home of absolute political despotismis also the birthplace of BakuninHertzenKropotkinand TolstoyIn Americawhere what Mencken callsthe new puritanismoperates more oppressively than political governmentit is in behalf of sex freedom that most frequent and vehement protest is heardIn the case of Voltairine de Cleyre this reaction declared itself neither because of political nor of sexual restraintIt came about in the realm of religionIt began from the moment whenat the age of twelvethe sensitive gifted girl was placed in the hands of a Roman Catholic sisterhoodpresumably that her education might be safeFor four years the young Voltairine lived at the convent of Our Lady of Lake Huron at SarniaOntarioheartsick with lonelinesswrithing under the padded yoke of conventual disciplinegathering within her soul that flame which was never destined to be quenched save in deathOut of that experience she came with a mind wholly emancipated from the dogmas of religionNot long afterward she entered upon what promised to be a brilliant career as a secularist lecturerThat a nature like hers would long confine itself to labor in the barren field of theological controversy was not to have been expectedShe was too vitaltoo humanIt is possible that the delicacy of her own health intensified her sense of the world painHer sympathies are not alone of the intellect but of the nervesOne feels the nerve torture of an imaginative and poetic invalid in her confession of the reasons which had drawn her to adopt the anarchist propagandaShe pictures herself as standing upon a mighty hill from which she writes I saw the roofs of the workshops of the little worldI saw the machinesthe things that men had made to ease their burdenthe wonderful thingsthe iron geniiI saw them set their iron teeth in the living flesh of the men who made them I saw the maimed and crumpled stumps of men go limping away into the night that engulfs the poorperhaps to be thrown up in the flotsam and jetsam of beggary for a timeperhaps to suicide in some dim corner where the black surge throws its slimeI saw the rose fire of the furnace shining on the blanched face of the man who tended itand knew surelyas I knew anything in lifethat never would a free man feed his blood to the fire like thatI saw swart bodiesall mangled and crushedborne from the mouths of the mines to be stowed away in a grave hardly less narrow and dark than that in wihch the living form had crouched tentwelvefourteen hours a day and I knew that in order that I might be warmI and youand those others who never do any dirty work those men had slaved away in those black graves and been crushed to death at lastI saw beside city streets great heaps of horrible colored earthand down at the bottom of the trench from which it was thrownso far down that nothing else was visiblebright gleaming eyeslike a wild animal hunted into its holeAnd I knew that free men never chose to labor therewith pick and shovelin that foulsewage soaked earthin that narrow trenchin that deadly sewer gas teneighteven six hours a dayOnly slaves would do itI saw deep down in the hull of the ocean liner the men who shoveled the coal burned and seared like paper before the grateand I knew thatthe recordof the beautiful monsterand the pleasure of the ladies who laughed on the deckwere paid for with those withered bodies and soulsI saw the scavenger carts go up and downdrawn by sad brutes and driven by sadder ones for never a mana man in full possession of his selfhoodwould freely choose to spend all his days in the nauseating stench that forces him to swill alcohol to neutralize itAnd I saw in the lead works how men were poisonedand in the sugar refineries how they went insane and in the factories how they lost their decencyand in the stores how they learned to lieand I knew it was slavery made

otherwise have been her natural allies and cut off those opportunities for worldly success which must in the ordinary course of things have come to herFinding the cause of economic slavery not in

the world grouped itself into two main campsBy far the larger of these took the attitude that Darwin was an impious propounder of disgusting and dangerous heresyThe smaller group hailed him as the bringer in of a new eraThe Little Review Samuel Butler allied himself with neither groupbut took the attitude of a constructive criticIn these pages he attacks contemporary Darwinism using the term in the narrow senseon two groundsThat it is not the novelty it is generally supposed to beon the one handand that the mechanism implied by its theory is not trueon the other handare his main pointsIn so far as Butler treats the first contentionhis book is even today of valueHe describes the pre Darwinian theories of evolutionespecially those of Erasmus Darwin and Lamarckand he strives to show that their explanations or provisional explanations were sometimes more near the truth than was Darwin s over emphasis upon the struggle for existence as the controlling factor in the evolution of speciesButler s own point of view is that evolution takes place in accordance with a designand it is this part of his book that will be of least importance at the present dayHe quotes Paleythe celebrated English theologian and advocate of the deified architect idea of Godto show that animal organisms do show evidences of what isstrictly speakingdesignand which cannot be referred to the ordinary Darwinian explanationsButler differs from Paleyhoweverin placing the designer not outside the cosmic flux of his working materialsbut within the organismNot Godhe saysbut the ancestral memory of man is the designerThe individual perishesbut his memory endures in his offspring and alters them in accordance with the lessons of ancestral experienceWe have said that this is the least valuable part of the bookand it is so for the reason that later biologists and philosophers with the biological approach have considerably enlarged the field of speculation in this particular realmThe theory ofentelechiesof Hans Driesch practically does for organisms what Butler does in his idea of unconscious memoryOn the other handthe newimminent teleologyof Bergson gives us a new angle on the whole question of design in natureAt the same timehoweverthe majority of biologists are harking back to a conception of evolution as a kind of mathematical proposition in which all is given to start withand in which the new is neither a new design nor a spontaneous creationbut is simply a liberation from inhibition of what was always implicit in the oldAnd the men of this school would never consent to write a book like this of Butler s To the seed pan and the incubatoris their cryThe time is not here when synthesis is either advisable or even possiblethey tell usAnd until we hear further from these modern experimenters the wise man will read Butler for his history and prospectiveand for his humorbut will not be guided by his theorieswhich are the workindeedof a brilliant intellectbut one working without our new dataand without experimental backingOf coursethe style of the book is delightfuland all who enjoy controversy and the play of dialectic should read itAnother class to whom it can be recommended is that large class of people who accept their view of evolution in the same spirit that an old lady accepts the Episcopalian creed and are twice as dogmatic over itILLIAM DHONEEmma Goldman and the Modern Drama The Social Significance of the Modern Dramaby Emma Goldman Richard GBadgerBostonThe points in which we disagree with the reviewer will be discussed in a coming issueThe Editor There is an element of the keenest adventure in one s first meeting with a great personalitywhether that encounter be in body or through the medium of the written wordIn the case of Emma Goldman I should judge the latter to be the severer testfor on the printed page she must stand and fall by the content of her messageunaided by the glamor of personal magnetism and eloquence of the lecture platformFor my own partI should have preferred to have met her as the fiery orator than as the purveyor of academic waresAnd yet in this present performance she comes forward not in the guise of the accustomed criticon the contrary she is very often quite uncriticalbut rather as the social interpreterIn other wordsEmma Goldman is here what she has always been the propagandistwith the modern drama as her latest textAnd she has a mighty text Becauseany mode of creative workwhich with true perception portrays social wrongs earnestly and boldlymay be a greater menace to our social fabric and a more powerful inspiration than the wildest harangue of the soapbox orator she has chosen the drama as the fittest mediumto arouse the intellectuals of this countryto make them realize

CompromiseAs she puts it in her foreword They know that society has gone beyond the stage of patching upand that man must throw off the dead weight of the pastwith all its ghosts and spooksif he is to go foot free to meet the futureThe Little Review Again and again she returns to her themeIn summarizing Ibsen s stand Already in BrandHenrick Ibsen demanded all or nothingno weak kneed moderationno compromise of any sort in the struggle for the idealIn praise of the author of Damaged GoodsBrieux is among the very few modern dramatists who go to the bottom of this question by insisting on a complete social and economic changewhich alone can free us from the scourge of syphilis and other social plaguesIn connection with Yeats s Where There is NothingIt embodies the spirit of revolt itselfof that most constructive revolt which begins with the destruction of every obstacle in the path of the new life that is to grow on the débris of the oldwhen the paralyzing yoke of institutionalism shall have been brokenand man left free to enjoy Life and LaughterThose who are a bit dubious of theLife and Laughterthat will follow the wholesale destruction of the past will have no difficulty in discovering the shortcomings of Miss Goldman s methodThey are the obvious ones which of necessity befall the single minded propagandist the intrusion of dogma and platitude into the discussionthe wearying insistence uponthe moralof each playthe uncritical attitude of too ready acquisence in the veracity of each dramatic picture of lifeetcSuch critics might point out that the artistin spite of Strindberg s dictumcannot be a merelay preacher popularizing the pressing questions of his timethat insofar as he approaches arthe does not preach that it is by virtue of this power that Hervieuxfor exampleis a greater artist than his better known contemporaryBrieux By the waywhy did Miss Goldman omit the greatest of the French social dramatists These critics might even throw in a word for the institutions of the past which Miss Goldman believes can be as easily shed as an outworn cloakBut one must not be an orthodoxAnarchist to recognize the superficiality of these shortcomings which are the inevitable luggage of the preacherFor Miss Goldman is a preacherAny interpreter works in accordance with his creedHaving taken to heart the fate of Lot s wifeMiss Goldman has turned her back fiercely upon the pastGrant her this hypothesis and she is always logical and coherent and never irrelevantAnd why shouldn t we encourage her to forge boldly aheaddisdainful of the old bondageWe need her courageher single mindednessand the aim to which she has vowed themShe is not alonefor many who know her not chant the same litanyAs for the danger to society that lurks in her philosophywe must not forget that the great conservative mass is leavened slowlyAnd in the end it is time alone who can give the verdictwhether we shall patch up the old fabricor destroy and begin our weaving anewMARGUERITE SWAWITE48 The Little Review The Whining of a Rejected One Oscar Wilde and Myselfby Lord Alfred Douglas Duffield and CompanyNew York Emma Goldman gave this laconic epithet to this latest pearl of scandal literatureMylord is very much in earnesthence his pitiful failure to see the humorous side of his pathetic self spankingThe modest title of the book obviously suggests the two fold purpose of the titular harlequinhis own aggrandizement and the dethronement of the Prince of ParadoxesHe excellently succeeds in obtaining the reverse result of his first endeavornot even his pugilistic fatherthe Marquis of Queensburycould have given him a more thorough boxing than the one he so earnestly performs over his own earsAs to his other ambitionthat of vying with the laurels of Herostrates in his attempt to belittle the dead lionwe must admit his success in one pointin proving the morbid vanity of WildeWhat but the passion for titular acquaintances could have induced the author of Salome to chum with Bosie Douglasthis burlesque snobso utterly shallowpettyso hopelessly stupid and arrogantI don t know what to admire more theethicsof the publisher or the sense of humor of the authorKA New Short Story Writer Life Is a Dreamby Richard Curie DoubledayPage and CompanyNew York It is to be hoped that Richard Curie will not long remain a name unfamiliar to American readersfor he is a writer of marked and unusual talentLife Is a Dream is the first of his books to be published in this countryandconsisting as it does of short storiesit can scarcely find as large an audience as it deservesFor there can be no doubt that volumes of short stories have only a modest saleKipling and OHenry to the contrary notwithstandingIn Curie s case this is a great pityfor the stories in Life Is a Dream are every one of them remarkable and they have not been printed elsewhereThey are not what we are accustomed to almost any magazine editor would reject themif only because they have none of thatpunchwhich so largely characterizes the work of Kipling and OHenrynot to mention the other and far smaller peopleIt is difficult for the man who The Little Review 49 writes stories withoutpunchto procure a hearingthe great popular magazines will have none of himstylecraftsmanshipsubtle psychologyexquisite colornone of theseand Curie is a master of them allcan quite atone for lack of that predominant American qualityAnd that is why Richard Curieworking as he has thus far in a genre that appealshowever stronglystill to only a fewmay be long in securing the recognition that is already quite his dueThere are nine stories of varying length in the present volumeThey take you to the corners of the earthLondonDamascusSpainthe West Indiesthe high seasCentral Americaand their spirit is well suggested in the title of the collectionLa Vida Es SuenoTruly they are such stuff as dreams are made ofCurie s feeling for the colorful wordthe precise phrase is remarkable in a moment one feels almost bodily transported to a strange and fascinating landAnd then the story is unfoldedfor these are real stories and never mere impressionistic sketchesThey may not be about the sort of people you are likely to number among your friendsbut they are about very human folk just the sameThey have a subtlety that is never too involved and an engaging frankness which is one of Curie s greatest charmsOld Hoskynsalmost homely in its simplicityis a very touching taleGoing Home is an exquisite bit of ironyThe Look Out Manslight though it isis profoundly tragicIn A Remittance Manlittle by littlelike a mosaica shrewdpenetratingand very convincing picture is built up of a man who has lost his grip on lifeAnd so they goCurie knows the people of his tales so well He is careful never to tell you too much about themthere is ample opportunity after each narrative for pleasant speculationbut one never feels that the real story he set out to tell has not been fully toldIt is equally important that Curie knows intimately the places he chooses as settings for his storiesMost of this knowledge he has gained in his amazingly extensive travelsAside from North America he has visited almost every corner of the earthAnd yet it is none the less very remarkablethis curious ability to paint atmospherea talent not too often associated with those who write in EnglishConrad has itand the greater continental writersand Curie has studied them to advantageI should nave myself to possess this same ability to make you realize the peculiar fascination of such a story as The Emerald SeekerIt is a fine and thrilling yarn no matter thatthere are many who can tell a rattling taleBut I doubt if any could approach Curie s masterly sketching of his milieua page or twoand in a very real sense you feel yourself in the heart of tropical Central AmericaFinally and best of allyou know that the color is never there merely for its own sake there is always a real story to be told and to its telling the background merely adds distinctionIt is diffi50 The Little Review culttrying to show the peculiar charm and interest of Curie s workBut once you read himit becomes very apparentRichard Curie is only thirty years oldIf the promise of Life Is a Dream is fulfilledhe should be one of the really significant writers of his dayHe has traveled widely and is widely readhe knows not only men and placesbut books as wellparticularly the works of the great Russian and FrenchmenAmong living writers he admires especially Joseph Conradwith whose work his own has a certain kinshipCuriously enough he has written the first adequate book on Conrad and it is shortly to be published in AmericaIt will reveal Curie as a critic of sympathyinsight and independenceMeanwhile every lover of good fictioneveryone who cares for skillful craftsmanship in literatureand all those adventurous persons who would see strange lands and people should read Life Is a DreamALFRED A KNOPFA New Study of William Morris William Morrisby AClutton Brock Henry Holt and CompanyNew YorkI dislike that method which many historians pursuetreating the past as a matter of death instead of lifeFor a baggage of rags and a jumble of bleached bones I have no concernYesterday is a thing I will not considerHistory is a proof of one thing only that circumstance is a fraudand that personality is a durability with eternityThe soul writes its autobiographyand those used for the syllables survive the seasons and the yearsRule and custom and people who are no more than these are for the scrap heapNight comes and swallows the deadHistory is nothing except for its exceptionsNature s royal men we discover despite their uniformsWe note not their habiliments they have a natural tongue and true approach and are masters of the secondsThey breathe life lustily stillThese are the veritiesThey are descriptive not of antiquity but of the mind which is nowThey show us who we areWe love them because of thisEvery time we read them we embark on a new voyageand discover to ourselves a treasure island of which hitherto we had not the slightest knowledgeTrojans of truththey lift their spears to the central sunto proclaim the splendor of the individualthe great reality of the NowThrough them we are made aware how rich we arewe begin to realize somewhat of our depths The Little Review they provide a new couragegive a new hopeand inspire us for the struggle ahead with the quality of an unwonted self relianceI have probably gone beyond my office in making these remarksbut the temptation provided by the biography of William Morris proved so strong that I could not forego themHere is a man of whom we cannot know too muchAn artist who gave his life for artwhat shall we say of himMrBrock has told a little of the mansometimes in an interesting waybut he does not make us intimate with himHoweveras he tells us in his prefacehe had no pretensionsHe is lucid and thoughtfulhe is excellent in his criticism of Morris s poetryand on the whole gives us a book well worthy of an hour s quietudeThe facts given are good by way of an introductionsufficient to send one in quest for greater knowledge of the manOne of Nature s henchmenfreshboldViking in the marrowwith a spirit of steela man for whom the sea would smilepoetpainterstainer of glassweaver of carpetsspinning a world with the strains of his songsocialist and revolutionistMorris comes as a teasing wind through the dank atmosphere of nineteenth century commercialismdaring conventions and going his way a body all soula majesty supreme to the lastWe get a little of the air of the man when we read these lines from the SigurdI quote from the biography There was a dwelling of Kings ere the world was waxen oldDukes were the door wards thereand the roofs were thatched with gold Earls were the wrights that wrought itand silver nailed the doorsEarlswives were the weaving womenqueensdaughters strewed the floorAnd the masters of its song craft were the mightiest men that cast The sails of the storm of battle adown the bickering blastOne cannot but remark the manhood and courage of thisA Luxury of LifeA freedom here that would fill the windsIt is not to be wondered that such a man should chafe under the tyranny of skin girt stupidityand feel a loathing toward the flannel souled people who in his time were already making machines of men and building a world around them of uglinesscities without bearingwithout characterwithout mirthwithout lifeCities of the deadwhere ghosts might abideIt is in the realm of arthoweverthat we must look for Morris would we view him in the lightArt gave the world a child who would lead it by the hand to the Princess Beautiful that the maiden should have a lover to wooA childyes and a warrior toowho would do battle with any of her enemiesI would not say that he knew more of art in its relation to life than did RuskinWildeand Whistlerhe washoweverfar more active of the purposeHe saw that art was not a mere thing for the gallerieswhere Mediocrity can sniff and vaunt its conceits for him it was serious of all natureof the whole circle and the endless series of circlesThat which gives ear to the tongues of stones and from marble delivers its soulhe wanted Life to seekThere was a spice in art for Morris which made it dangerous for milk sopsArt for him was a Reality the existence around him a fraudand Life a cowardiceHe had Truth on his sidehe hated shams and he joined the socialist movement because he saw here a means for their overturningIn a very interesting chapter MrBrock tells how Morrisafter breakfasting with Burne Joneswould go out to some street corner and lecture on socialism to a throng of workingmensome dirty and in ragsHe had his couragethis manThere dwells in each of us a heroism of which the last has not been spokenCarlyle was drunk with itEmerson wrote itMorris lived itA great artistbut a greater manLife for him was a cavalier extravagance thus would he have all men liveTo make the world livewe must give of our livingBreathe life into all things that they too will have manners and extend a friendship s greetingsFor practical people Morris is still anathema for human beingshoweverhe is yet a comrade in the struggleMrBrock s study of him is therefore welcomecoming as it does with fresh intelligence of his natureHis book most certainly is a thing to be readGFExaggerated Mushrooms Minions of the Moonby Madison Cawein Stewart and KiddCincinnati At a glance the book seems merely a collection of unusual nursery rhymesbut after a careful reading one finds little glimmers of poetrylike fadded flowers touched with sulphur and pressed between the leaves of a very inane volumeIf you have the sublime suggestion of patience necessary to turn the leaves of the book you will rather delight in fingering the flowersThey are moon light flowersMrCawein is at his best when he goes into his usual tremulous raptures over moon lightHis moon light poems actually drip with slimwistfulto use a much abused wordcolorIf he could forget elfsfairiesand mushrooms for more than a momentMadison Cawein would reach the plateausif not the mountain tips of poetryBut he can only cast out the trite child which has taken possession of himnow and thenStrange to saythough three or four of the poems in the volume are goodthey do not contain a line worth quotingTheir half beauty lies in the ensembleAs for the rest of the bookI can best describe it by saying that one feels inclined to turn over the pageMBThe Little

inspiringEspecially the advice and warning he gives in his lastLet us go to the theatres next fall prepared to trace the beginnings of a new stage art in this country in the meantimehowevernot hoping to escape the flood of cheap and artisticaly vicious stuff with which the commercial managers will attempt to drown our sensibilities Perhaps after this warning one ought not become agitated or angry

something that is supposed to be the uttermost of stage productionand failswellthen one can t help becoming irritatedIn a production of Joseph and His Brethren which I saw recently there is evidence
