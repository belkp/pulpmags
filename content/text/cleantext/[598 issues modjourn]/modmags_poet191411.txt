scene is a bare room with two shaded windows at the back and a fireplace between them with a fire burning low The room is furnished scantily with a few plain chairs and a rough wooden table on which are piled a great many small wooden trays The Counter who is Death sits at the table He wears a loose gray robe and his face is partly concealed by a gray veil He does not look at The Bearer but works mechanically and speaks in a monotonous tone The Bearer is the World that bears the burden of War He wears a soiled robe of brown and green and he carries on his back a gunny bag filled with the little metal disks that have been used for the identification of the slain common soldiers  The Bearer  Here is a sack a gunny sack  A heavy sack I bring Here is toll of many a soul  But not the soul of a king   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  This is the toll of common men Who lived in the common way Lived upon bread and wine and love In the light of the common day  This is the toll of working men Blood and brawn and brain Who shall render us again The worth of all the slain  As The Counter speaks The Bearer pours out the disks on the table The Bearer obeys The Counter  The Counter  Pour them out on the table here  C 1 i c k e t y c 1 i c k e t y c l a c k For every button a man went out And who shall call him back  C 1 i c k e t y c 1 i c k e t y c la c k  One two three four  Every disk a soul Three score four score So many boys went out to war Pick up that one that fell on the floor  Didn t you see it roll That was a man a month ago This was a man Row upon row Pile them in tens and count them so   The Metal Checks  The Bearer I have an empty sack It is not large Would you have said That I could carry on my back So great an army and all dead As The Counter speaks Thehis arm and helps count The Counter Bearer lays the sack over Put a hundred in each tray We can tally them best that way Careful do you understand You have ten men in your hand There s another fallen there Under that chair The Bearer finds it and restores it That was a man a month ago He could see and feel and know Then into his throat there sped A bit of lead Blood was salt in his mouth he fell And lay amid the battle wreck Nothing was left but this metal check And a wife and child perhaps The Bearer finds the bagholds it up inspecting it on his arm troublesome He holds it up inspecting it    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The Bearer  What can one do with a thing like this Neither of life nor death it is  For the dead serve not though it served the dead  The wounds it carried were wide and red  Yet they stained it not Can a man put food  Potatoes or wheat or even wood  That is kind and burns with a flame to warm  Living men who are comforted  In a thing that has served so many dead  There is no thrift in a graveyard dress  It s been shroud for too many men I ll burn it and let the dead bless  He crosses himself and throws it into the fire He watches it burn The Counter continues to pile up the metal checks and drop them by hundreds into the trays which he piles one upon another The Bearer turns from the fire and speaks more slowly than he has before He indicates the metal checks  Would not the blood of these make a great sea For men to sail their ships on It may be No fish would swim in it and the foul smell Would make the sailors sick Perhaps in Hell There s some such lake for men who rush to war Prating of glory and upon the shore Will stand the wives and children and old men Bereft to drive them back again   The Metal Checks  When they seek haven Some such thing  I thought the while I bore it on my back  And heard the metal pieces clattering  The Counter  Four score five score These and as many more Forward march into the tray No bugles blow today No captains lead the way But mothers and wives Fathers sisters little sons Count the cost Of the lost And we count the unlived lives The forever unborn ones Who might have been your sons  The Bearer  Could not the hands of these rebuild That which has been destroyed Oh the poor hands that once were strong and filled With implements of labor whereby they Served home and country through the peaceful day When those who made the war stand face to face With these slain soldiers in that unknown place Whither the dead go what will be the word By dead lips spoken and by dead ears heard Will souls say King or Kaiser Will souls prate  Of earthly glory in that new estate   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The Counter  One hundred thousand One hundred and fifty thousand Two hundred  The Bearer  Can this check plough Can it sow can it reap Can we arouse it Is it asleep  Can it hear when a child cries  Comfort a wife This little metal disk Stands for a life  Can this check build Laying stone upon stone Once it was warm flesh Folded on bone  Sinew and muscle firm Look at it can This little metal check Stand for a man  The Counter  One two three four  Louise Driscoll   CHANT OF THE SHROUD MAKER  We shall need also shrouds  Others work for the living Be mine to work for the dead Afar there rages the battle loud With tender hands I fashion a shroud For the clay when the soul has fled  Soldier stranger friend Man I shall never see Loving I weave a winding sheet For one who has died for me  Triply the sheet be folded For the Blessed Trinity And on his bosom his folded hands Unwanted now for life s demands And the scarlet cross shall be  Soldier brother friend Face I shall never see Loving I weave a winding sheet For one who has died for me  Cover the clay deserted Now that the life has sped   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Prayers blessings and grateful tears Follow his memory through the years Peace to the honored dead  Soldier brother friend Man I shall never see Loving I weave a winding sheet For one who has died for me  Marian Ramie  IF WAR IS RIGHT  If war is right then God is might And every prayer is vain Go raze your temples from the hills Red death is in the plain  If war is right then God is might And every prayer is vain Look not for Christ upon the hills He lies among the slain  Parke Farley   THE HERO  Bomb and ball and shell Had done their work so well That after many weeks The city fell  To save the women so the burghers said  Then with red dripping sword We the enemy poured Down through the streets To know what spoils the city might afford  What are the spoils of war  A corporal nameless with a little troop Of nameless men has stopped before a stoop Whose door s ajar The corporal laughs Ha Note the family group  A man and wife three daughters and a dog  Ten of the soldiers enter Seize the goat  No no don t shoot him cut the villain s throat  That s right a little blood Don t splutter so you fool  before the ladies  What not dead yet You ve bled a quart you bloat  A corporal must have his joke you know   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Well let him die There s tastier business now Here you two nearest strip me that old sow Too fat by far but get those rags off boys That s it Now tie her up so she can see the row What are the spoils of war  Now for the ninnies Three to each and quick Hell what a form She d make a queen look sick She s mine You take the others And when you re through a butt ll do the trick A rifle butt is a handy thing they say  An hour later Stretch them in a row  The old sow s fainted Didn t like the show Perhaps Fat ugh Better unburden her belly That s it a twist of the sword Well bring the dog and  off we go A mascot s good to keep the spirits up  Again the howl of war Again the roar Of cannon and the rain Of bombs from ships that soar And we must win for God is on our side   The Hero  The devilish enemy  Force onward sullenly  We are turned driven routed  Drop everything and flee  Why does not God uphold the right  But see The flag is raised And waved aloft Amazed But ready to be led we turn about Tis the work of the very God we praised  Men can do worse than follow a flag  And there in the mighty din  We win  And turn to see who bore the colors back  We gather round and hem the hero in  A nameless corporal now to be named forever  Mark where the hero stands  A banner in his hands  Banner of bronze in hands of bronze  Bronze on granite forever he stands  Was he not chosen of God  John Russell McCarthy   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE BOMBARDMENT  Slowly without force the rain drops into the city It stops a moment on the carved head of Saint John then slides on again slipping and trickling over his stone cloak It splashes from the lead conduit of a gargoyle and falls from it in turmoil on the stones in the Cathedral square Where are the people and why does the fretted steeple sweep about in the sky Boom The sound swings against the rain Boom again After it only water rushing in the gutters and the turmoil from the spout of the gargoyle Silence Ripples and mutters Boom  The room is damp but warm Little flashes swarm about from the firelight The lustres of the chandelier are bright and clusters of rubies leap in the Bohemian glasses on the étagère Her hands are restless but the white masses of her hair are quite still Boom Will it never cease to torture this iteration Boom The vibration shatters a glass on the étagère It lies there formless and glowing with all its crimson gleams shot out of pattern spilled flowing red blood red A thin bell note pricks through the silence A door creaks The old lady speaks Victor clear away that broken glass Alas Madame the Bohemian glass Yes Victor one hundred years ago my father brought it Boom The room shakes the servitor quakes Another goblet shivers and breaks Boom   The Bombardment  It rustles at the window pane the smooth streaming rain and he is shut within its clash and murmur Inside is his candle his table his ink his pen and his dreams He is thinking and the walls are pierced with beams of sunshine slipping through young green A fountain tosses itself up at the blue sky and through the spattered water in the basin he can see copper carp lazily floating among cold leaves A wind harp in a cedar tree grieves and whispers and words blow into his brain bubbled iridescent shooting up like flowers of fire higher and higher Boom The flame flowers snap on their slender stems The fountain rears up in long broken spears of disheveled water and flattens into the earth Boom And there is only the room the table the candle and the sliding rain Again Boom Boom Boom He stuffs his fingers into his ears He sees corpses and cries out in fright Boom It is night and they are shelling the city Boom Boom  A child wakes and is afraid and weeps in the darkness What has made the bed shake Mother where are you I am awake Hush my Darling I am here But Mother something so queer happened the room shook Boom Oh What is it What is the matter Boom Where is father I am so afraid Boom The child sobs and shrieks The house trembles and creaks Boom  Retorts globes tubes and phials lie shattered All his trials oozing across the floor The life that was his choosing   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  lonely urgent goaded by a hope all gone A weary man in a ruined laboratory that was his story Boom Gloom and ignorance and the jig of drunken brutes Diseases like snakes crawling over the earth leaving trails of slime Wails from people burying their dead Through the window he can see the rocking steeple A ball of fire falls on the lead of the roof and the sky tears apart on a spike of flame Up the spire behind the lacings of stone zig zagging in and out of the carved tracings squirms the fire It spouts like yellow wheat from the gargoyles coils round the head of Saint John and aureoles him in light It leaps into the night and hisses against the rain The Cathedral is a burning stain on the white wet night  Boom The Cathedral is a torch and the houses next to it begin to scorch Boom The Bohemian glass on the étagère is no longer there Boom A stalk of flame sways against the red damask curtains The old lady cannot walk She watches the creeping stalk and counts Boom Boom Boom  The poet rushes into the street and the rain wraps him in a sheet of silver But it is threaded with gold and powdered with scarlet beads The city burns Quivering spearing thrusting lapping streaming run the flames Over roofs and walls and shops and stalls Smearing its gold on the sky the fire dances lances itself through the doors and lisps and chuckles along the floors   The Bombardment  The child wakes again and screams at the yellow petaled flower flickering at the window The little red lips of flame creep along the ceiling beams  The old man sits among his broken experiments and looks at the burning Cathedral Now the streets are swarming with people They seek shelter and crowd into the cellars They shout and call and over all slowly and without force the rain drops into the city Boom And the steeple crashes down among the people Boom Boom again The water rushes along the gutters The fire roars and mutters Boom  Amy Lowell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  AMONG THE RED GUNS  After waking at dawn one morning when the wind sang low among dry leaves in an elm  Among the red guns  In the hearts of soldiers  Running free blood  In the long long campaign  Dreams go on  Among the leather saddles In the heads of soldiers Heavy in the wracks and kills Of all straight fighting  Dreams go on  Among the hot muzzles In the hands of soldiers Brought from flesh folds of women Soft amid the blood and crying In all your hearts and heads Among the guns and saddles and muzzles  Dreams Dreams go on Out of the dead on their backs Broken and no use any more Dreams of the way and the end go on  Carl Sandburg   THE CAMP FOLLOWER  We spoke the camp follower and I About us was a cold pungent odor Gun powder stale wine wet earth and the smell of thou  sands of men She said it reminded her of the scent In the house of prostitutes she had lived in About us were soldiers hordes of scarlet women stupidly  smilingly giving up their bodies To a putrid lipped chuckling lover Death While their mistresses in tinsel whipped them on She spoke of a woman she had known in Odessa Owner of a huge band of girls Who had pocketed their earnings for years Only to be used swindled and killed by some noble  man  She said she thought of this grinning woman  Whenever she saw an officer brought back from battle  dead And I sat beside her and wondered  Maxwell Bodenheim   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE JEWISH CONSCRIPT  There are nearly a quarter of a million Jews in the Czar s army alone Newspaper clipping  They have dressed me up in a soldier s dress With a rifle in my hand And have sent me bravely forth to shoot My own in a foreign land  Oh many shall die for their fields and homes And many in conquest wild But I shall die for the fatherland That murdered my little child  How many hundreds of years ago The nations wax and cease Did the God of our fathers doom us to bear The flaming message of peace  We are the mock and the sport of time Yet why should I complain For a Jew that they hung on the bloody cross He also died in vain  Florence Kiper Frank   WHENCE COMES THE STRANGER  Whence comes this stranger  That with hoarse lifted throat  Threatens the fields  Night s darkness And the darkness of mystery Cover him as in a tent Of two hides  At twilight I looked through the windows of my body And lo The sheaves scattered And the rooted trees uptorn  His feet are flails of iron What he has threshed Only the birds of the air will gather Bedstraw and branch Will lie and rot And dig unseen graves  The wind blows where it wills The Gift of Heaven wrote it in Patmos I hear the sound thereof   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  But cannot tell whence it comes Or whither it will go  War rides without thought On a pale horse Through quiet places His banners are smoking torches His trumpets blow horribly  He reaps a red harvest But not with the crooks of sickles The swaths fall slowly And the wings of vultures shadow them  Love is a lamb for weakness Kin a dove for sorrow Peace the silence of a song  He thunders And the suckling s cry Is not heard He casts his lightning And flame breaks from the roofbeam He shakes the earth And the stones of the altar Are dust   Whence Comes the Stranger  At dawn I looked through the windows of my spirit And lo A sower had passed Sowing  For my thoughts Are not your thoughts Neither are your ways My ways Saith the Lord  Joseph Campbell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PHASES  I There s a little square in Paris Waiting until we pass They sit idly there They sip the glass  There s a cab horse at the corner  There s rain The season grieves  It was silver once  And green with leaves  There s a parrot in a window  Will see us on parade  Hear the loud drums roll  And serenade  II This was the salty taste of glory That it was not Like Agamemnon s story Only an eyeball in the mud And Hopkins Flat and pale and gory  III But the bugles in the night Were wings that bore To where our comfort was   Phases Arabesques of candle beams Winding Through our heavy dreams Winds that blew Where the bending iris grew Birds of intermitted bliss Singing in the night s abyss Vines with yellow fruit That fell Along the walls That bordered Hell IV Death s nobility again Beautified the simplest men Fallen Winkle felt the pride Of Agamemnon When he died What could London s Work and waste Give him To that salty sacrificial taste What could London s Sorrow bring To that short triumphant sting Wallace Stevens    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FALLEN  He was wounded and he fell in the midst of hoarse shouting The tide passed and the waves came and whispered about  his ankles Far off he heard a cock crow children laughing Rising at dawn to greet the storm of petals Shaken from apple boughs he heard them cry And turned again to find the breast of her And sank confused with a little sigh Thereafter water running and a voice That seemed to stir and flutter through the trenches And set dead lips to talking   Wreckage was mingled with the storm of petals   He felt her near him and the weight dropped off Suddenly   Alice Corbin   THE WAKENED GOD  The War god wakened drowsily There were gold chains about his hands He said And who shall reap my lands  And bear the tithes to Death for me  The nations stilled my thunderings They wearied of my steel despair The flames from out my burning hair Is there an ending of such things  Low laughed the Earth and answered When Was any changeless law I gave Changed by my sons intent to save  By puny pitying hands of men  I feel no ruth for some I bear The swarming hungering overflow Of crowded millions doomed to go They must destroy who chained you there  For some bright stone or shining praise They stint a million bodies breath And sell the women shamed to death And send the men brief length of days   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  They kill the bodies swift for me And kill the souls you gave to peace You were more merciful than these  Old master of my cruelty  Lo souls are scarred and virtues dim Take back thy scourge of ministry Rise from thy silence suddenly  Lest these still take Death s toll to him  The War God snapped his golden chain His mercies thundered down the world And lashing battle lines uncurled  And scourged the crouching lands again  Margaret Widdemer   UNSER GOTT  They held a great prayer service in Berlin And augured German triumph from some words Said to be spoken by the Jewish God To Gideon which signified that He Was staunchly partial to the Israelites The aisles were thronged and in the royal box  I had it from a tourist who was there Clutching her passport anxious like the rest There sat the Kaiser looking very sad And then they sang she said it shook the heart The women sobbed tears salted bearded lips Unheeded and my friend looked back and saw A young girl crumple in her mother s arms They carried out a score of them she said While German hearts through bursting German throats Poured out Ein Feste Burg Ist Unser Gott  Yea Unser Gott Our strength is Unser Gott Not that light minded Bon Dieu of France  I think we all have made our God too small There was a young man a good while ago Who taught that doctrine but they murdered him Because he wished to share the Jewish God With other folk  They are long lived these fierce Old hating Gods of nations but at last   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  There surely will be spilled enough of blood To drown them all The deeps of sea and air Of old the seat of gods no more are safe For mines and monoplanes The Germans now Can surely find and rout the God of France With Zeppelins or some slim mother s son Of Paris or of Tours or Brittany Can drop a bomb into the Feste Burg And having crushed the source of German strength Die happy in his blazing monoplane  Sad jesting If there be no God at all Save in the heart of man why even so Yea all the more since we must make our God Oh let us make Him large enough for all Or cease to prate of Him If kings must fight Let them fight for their glory openly And plain men for their lands and for their homes And heady youths who go to see the fun Blaspheme not God True maybe we might leave The God of Germany to some poor frau Who cannot go who can but wait and mourn Except that she will teach Him to her sons A God quite scornful of the Slavic soul And much concerned to keep Alsace Lorraine They should go godless too the poor benumbed Crushed anguished women till their hearts can hold A greater Comforter   Unser Gott  Yet it is hard To make Him big enough For me I like The English and the Germans and the French The Russians too and Servians I should think Might well be very interesting to God But do the best I may my God is white And hardly takes a nigger seriously This side of Africa Not those at least Who steal my wood and of a summer night Keep me awake with shouting where they sit With monkey like fidelity and glee Grinding through their well oiled sausage mill The dead machinery of the white man s church Raw jungle fervor mixed with scraps sucked dry Of Israel s old sublimities not those And when they threaten us the Higher Race Think you which side is God s Oh let us pray Lest blood yet spurt to wash that black skin white As now it flows because a German hates A Cossack and an Austrian a Serb  What was it that he said so long ago The young man who outgrew the Jewish God Not a sparrow falleth Ah God God And there shall fall a million murdered men  Karle Wilson Baker   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WAR YAWP  America England s cheeky kid brother Who bloodily assaulted your august elder At Bunker Hill and similar places Not mentioned in our history books What can I tell you of war or of peace Say have you forgotten l86l Bull Run Gettysburg Fredericksburg Your million dead Tell me Was that the greatest time of your lives Or the most disastrous Who knows Not you not I Who can tell the end of this war And say brother Jonathan D you know what it s all about Let me whisper you a secret we don t We were all too fat with peace Or perhaps we didn t quite know how good peace was And so here we are And we re going to win  It s fine to be a soldier To get accepted by the recruiting sergeant Be trained fitted with a uniform and a gun   War Yawp  Say good bye to your girl And go off to the front Whistling It s a long way to Tipperary It s good to march forty miles a day Carrying ninety one pounds on your back To eat good coarse food get blistered tired out wounded Thirst starve fight like a devil  i e like you an me Jonathan With the Maxims zip zipping And the shrapnel squealing And the howitzers rumbling like the traffic in Piccadilly  Civilization Jonathan if you could hear them Whistling the Marseillaise or Marching Through Georgia You d want to go too Twenty thousand a day Jonathan Perhaps you re more civilized just now than we are Perhaps we ve only forgotten civilization for a moment Perhaps we re really fighting for peace And after all it will be more fun afterwards More fun for the poets and the painters When the cheering s all over And the dead men buried And the rest gone back to their jobs  It ll be more fun for them to make their patterns Their word patterns and color patterns   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And after all there is always war and always peace Always the war of the crowds Always the great peace of the arts  Even now With the war beating in great waves overhead Beating and roaring like great winds and mighty waters The sea gods still pattern the red seaweed fronds Still chip the amber into neck chains For Leucothea and Thetis  Even now  When the Marseillaise screams like a hurt woman And Paris grisette among cities trembles with fear The poets still make their music Which nobody listens to Which hardly anyone ever listened to  The great crowds go by Fighting over each other s bodies in peace time Fighting over each other s bodies in war time Something of the strife comes to them In their little high rock citadel of art Where they hammer their dreams in gold and copper Where they cut them in pine wood in Parian stone in wax Where they sing them in sweet bizarre words T o the sound of antiquated shrill instruments And they are happy   War Yawp  The little rock citadel of the artists Is always besieged There though they have beauty and silence They have always tears and hunger and despair  But that little citadel has held out Against all the wars of the world Like England brother Jonathan  It will not fall during the great war  There is always war and always peace  Always the war of the crowds  Always the great peace of the arts  Richard Aldington  COMMENTS AND REVIEWS  POETRY AND WAR  IN the seventeenth century the poet Milton set  himself to justify the ways of God to man  God was held accountable to man for his  actions it seeems and the fact that there was  an open breach between divine and human ideals of responsibility is obviously indicated in the need for justification Or were not the shortcomings of man his essential weakness in conduct and understanding glozed over by fixing the responsibility for this weakness upon the divine author of creation  Today in the supreme crisis of the twentieth century it would seem that the heavy task imposed upon the poets is to justify the ways of man or nations to God  Is it any wonder that the poets have failed  We can hardly expect Mr Hardy Mr Kipling Mr Bridges or Mr Masefield to succeed where modern diplomacy has failed but the failure of the poets unlike that of the diplomats and kings is due to a lack of conviction Actually the poets have progressed beyond the stage of that confident national self assertion which the particular crisis calls upon them to celebrate If their poems are not faint hearted they are at least interchangeable and would apply equally well to any country engaged in the struggle  Clearly what we instinctively demand of the poet today is not a justification of the ways of man to God but a justification of the ways of man to man   Comments and Reviews  If the patriotic poems of Mr Kipling Mr Hardy Mr Bridges or Mr Masefield seem to us inadequate it is because these poets have in reality outstripped the stage of martial enthusiasm and partisan spirit it is because these poets feel even if they do not realize the fact themselves that it is impossible to justify the ways of man or of any country to God in the present conflict Varying degrees of right and wrong included in a greater wrong can count for little with disillusioned minds War has actually lost its illusion and its glamour Some shreds of illusion may cling to the individual experience the elemental sense of tragedy may lift the unforgiveable facts to the height of emotional eloquence but of what worth is this eloquence beside  the collective naked waste  The American feeling about the war is a genuine revolt  against war and we have believed that POETRY might help  to serve the cause of peace by encouraging the expression of  this spirit of protest  Just as the neutrality of the United States is in no  sense passive so the spirit of her poets is one of active  antagonism to the barbaric survival of war  English poets are not in a position just now to celebrate  the spirit of democracy as against that of empire Yet  is not this democratic sympathy the cause of the subtle  undercurrent of regret we detect in their poems Mr J A  Cramb in Germany and England says England  is a nation schooled in empire from the past the power  which once belonged to the few passing more and more   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  into the ranks of the English race itself so that you have for the first time in history at once a nation and a democracy that is imperial If the English poets seem to us to lack conviction it may be because at heart they are better democrats than imperialists  There is very little of the taint of military imperialism in the 738 poems received in this contest Instead there is a general disposition to substitute for the retrogressive military ideals of a Bernhardi a Treitschke or a Cramb the divine common sense of Abraham Lincoln No future historian of the United States will be able to use quotations from her twentieth century poets in support of an imperial policy of conquest and slaughter  The American poet may fail indeed he does not even attempt to justify the ways of man to God but he does not fail to realize that it is only through the justification of the ways of man to man that the ways of man may be  ultimately justified to God A C H REVIEWS The Sea is Kind by T Sturge Moore Houghton Mifflin Company  Mr T Sturge Moore has the magic wand and all he touches turns to gold or at least to a shimmering silver Rich lingering syllables slow phrases full of sound long recitative clauses with unexpected little turns of melody these fill his book to the brim with music as rich and delicate as a Debussy pastoral Like Debussy s also it is a new note a   Reviews  modern development though it is easy enough to trace the poet s ancestry direct or collateral through his friend Mr Yeats and those remoter friends Arnold Keats Crashaw perhaps back to the singing Elizabethans especially Spenser and the romance poets they hearkened to  In the lyric dialogue which gives its name to the volume the nightingale says to Eucritos in a pause of song  There is a sorcery in well loved words But unintelligible music still Probes to the buried Titan in the heart Whose strength the vastness of forgotten life Suffers but is not dead  So in Mr Moore s poetry one listens to the word sorcerer s music with but slighter care for what he is saying The music itself is full of profound emotion it expresses spiritual stature and majesty and keeps the soul alive with longing Yet if the mind takes thought it finds deep meanings clad in proud new raiment it goes seeking for truth for the high nameless love beyond love with a poet who finds these infinite ideas infinitely dear and who cares comparatively little for lesser loves and sorrows the staple of most lives The Dying Swan illustrates this loftiness of mood which one may follow with more detail in many longer poems  O silver throated Swan  Struck struck a golden dart  Clean through thy breast has gone  Home to thy heart  Thrill thrill O silver throat  O silver trumpet pour   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Love for defiance back On him who smote And brim brim o er With love and ruby dye thy track Down thy last living reach Of river sail the golden light Enter the sun s heart even teach O wondrous gifted Pain teach thou The God of love let him learn how  Lesser subjects are transfigured by this light Some of the poems for children are as honestly child like as Stevenson s but they deal more with the spirit of rapture  in childhood even when the subject is as ordinary as Shoes  and Stockings Off or Beautiful Meals  How nice it is to eat All creatures love it so That they who first did spread Ere breaking bread A cloth like level snow Were right I know  In David and Goliath it is the poet rather than the child who half sighs It is always good to be Where long sighed for things Are done with that felicity Every hero with him brings  Mr Moore s poetry is done with felicity in it is the  rapture which a true musician strikes out of a noble instru  ment and every opus is in his own authentic style although  the quality varies There are delicate surprises in his  rhythms even when he uses a form as sharply defined as  the sonnet but he is more happy in freer rhymed forms  H M   Reviews  The Sister of the Wind by Grace Fallow Norton Houghton Mifflin Co  If it were not for her former book Little Gray Songs from St Joseph s this little volume might be dismissed with a few words of praise for occasional charming lines and the immature character of many of the verses passed over without remark But Miss Norton by her former book has earned the right to be taken as a serious poet and regarding her in that light much of this collection is disappointing It would seem to be made up largely of youthful poems written before the period of Little Gray Songs and it is always a pity after an assured success to let early work see the light of day The reader has a right to expect a surer technique a more ripened habit of mind than early work can give  Miss Norton always writes in a kind of strange unearthly glamour hers is a dream imagery her scenic effects are those of a vision This is not a modern method and Miss Norton is practically the only writer today who employs it and to be alone in a field is always a distinction It is a pity therefore that the poems in this volume suffer so frequently from irritating mannerisms For instance repetition  Far far far Wild love bear me far  I was a flame I was a flame That danced too hotly bright  It is also annoying to have to pronounce horizon on the  first syllable for the sake of the metre as in the lines   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  O Sower of the Seed I have no horizon Save where dream rush and reed Were o er this memory won or forest on the last in the poem of Lawrence Hope And to speak of hands which have shook for the sake of the rhyme in the same poem is unpardonable But in spite of these faults due I am sure to the verses being youthful attempts there are some beautiful poems in the book First of all I think Allegra Agonistes but also A Lament of Yasmini Fear bred and A Letter to a Friend There are some verbal felicities too to make up for the infelicities Thy pretty crescent island leaf gay by day I see is an attractive internal rhyme and in Malarude to speak of a wave as All purfled fringed and Tyrian tinged gives a shiver of pleasure The Sister of the Wind from which the volume takes its name is the most considerable poem in the book and would seem to be of later production than most of the others The divisions of it which are to my mind the most successful are VII X and XIII A L  Songs for the New Age by James Oppenheim The Century Co Songs for the new age these latest poems of Mr Oppen  heim s are in truth as well as in name an expression always adequate and at times beautiful of the ideals of many of   Reviews  the younger men today But with the advantages of this type of verse they share the disadvantages Their value as art is for today only They are topically not technically interesting The impression left on the mind is not as with the older poets that here is a lover of the beautiful but that here is a lover of life as it is lived today It seems almost adventitious that they should be in verse form at all even so loose a form as polyrythmics  Mr Oppenheim has definitely abandoned the rhymed verse forms of his earlier work for this more elastic medium which in spite of its new name was old when Whitman used it But fortunately he has not entirely laid aside the sense of artistic restraint which the technic of these earlier forms gave him  Rhythmically the poems in this volume are not equally successful Naturally enough perhaps the more fundamental and primitive emotions like love and the sheer physical joy of living seem to create in Mr Oppenheim more simple and beautiful rhythmical expressions than his more intellectual concepts There is some splendid love poetry here honest open air love poetry from which the lilies and languors of virtue are as lacking as the roses and raptures of vice Something of the spirit and of the rhythm of the old Hebrew poets is in it  As representing three different facets of the same spiritual attitude Sin Beloved and One Flesh are especially noteworthy Here is a short poem The Runner in the Skies which will give a little of the book s flavor   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Who is the runner in the skies With her blowing scarf of stars And our earth and sun hovering like bees about her blossoming  heart Her feet are on the winds where space is deep Her eyes are nebulous and veiled She hurries through the night to a far lover  E T Beyond the Stars and Other Poems by Charles Hanson  Towne Mitchell Kennerley  One is soothed not startled by this small book of quiet poems Many of them are obvious enough perhaps too obvious in idea and metrical arrangement and none of them ventures far into new fields Yet there is a soft slow music in their cadences and in the feeling of certain ones is a gentle dignity and beauty  These qualities are most evident in the title piece of the volume which was one of POETRY S earliest publications in a number now far too rare They appear also in certain of the shorter poems A Ballad contains this quatrain  It was her eyes that held me most I never dreamed such eyes could be Tired as the dust of ancient queens Or ruined cities by the sea And the first four couplets of How Softly Runs the  Afternoon pile up whites upon whites in softly musical syl  lables  How softly runs the afternoon Beneath the billowy cloudy of June How brightly every moment slips How lightly sail the great cloud ships How slowly all the galleons go Within that airy sea of snow   Reviews  Their white sails set vast argosies Bound for mysterious Hebrides  H M  The Falconer of God and Other Poems by William Rose Benêt Yale University Press  The real magic of Mr Benet s Merchants from Cathay and his Baron Munchausen the strange if deliberate magic of Arabia and Ind of ivory and spices and jewelled turbans is somehow lacking in this newest volume It should be there the recipe is much the same but the mystery is flown Only in spots does it gleam fitfully The title poem for instance which appeared recently in POETRY has  some truly magical lines I flung my soul to the air like a falcon flying I said Wait on wait on while I ride below I shall start a heron soon In the marsh beneath the moon A strange white heron rising with silver on its wings But for the most part Mr Benêt spoils his effects by  over much striving His technic is too conscious his rhyme and rhythm schemes too elaborate and involved to produce unity of effect His words trip the mind constantly Take  these lines for instance Like miraculous shining electrum This wide amber light As a lyre that is plucked by a plectrum The wind in the firs on the height  There are however besides the title poem several deserving of mention The Foreign Sailor Café Tortoni 81 and in another style Poor Girl are distinctly inter  esting E T   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The Shadow of Aetna by Louis V Ledoux G P Put  nam s Sons  One may well decry the use of general terms to define  or pigeon hole authors but the term classicist as applied  to Mr Ledoux is not general but precise His work has  that quality of security which is gained through an ap  preciative sense of balance and repose It has not the  violent gesture of romantic or realistic awakening a painful  mood is not necessarily an unpleasant one From this it  may be inferred that the word classicist is not here used  as it is so often used today as a term of reproach Occa  sionally one feels however that Mr Ledoux s poems are  a little remote from life Persephone A Masque and The Shadow of Aetna leave a less definite impression than the brief songs and lyrics in the book which record fleeting personal emotions A C H  CHIEF JOSEPH ON WAR  Speaking of war poems one of the finest we have read is this by the great Indian Chief Joseph which was quoted in a recent issue of the college magazine published by the Indian boys at Carlisle  Hear me my chiefs my heart is sick and sad Our chiefs are killed The old men are all dead It is cold and we have no blankets The little children are freezing to death Hear me my chiefs my heart is sick and sad From where the sun now stands I will fight no more forever   ANNOUNCEMENT OF AWARDS  The HELEN HAIRE LEVINSON Prize of two hundred  dollars offered by Mr Salmon O Levinson of Chicago  for the best poem or group of poems by a citizen of the  United States published by POETRY during its second year  is awarded by the editorial staff of the magazine to  MR CARL SANDBURG  of Chicago for his group of Chicago Poems published in  the March number  This prize will be continued for the magazine s third year by the generous donor  The prize of one hundred dollars offered in our September number by anonymous donors for the best war or peace poem based on the present European situation is awarded to  Miss LOUISE DRISCOLL of Catskill New York for her poem Metal Checks which opens the present number  The committee regrets that it is unable to award prizes to two or three other poets It would like especially to honor in this way the beautiful poem On Heaven contributed by Mr Ford Madox Hueffer to the June number  We urge with confidence the endowment of further prizes and scholarships by generous patrons of art Prizes of a thousand fifteen hundred even two thousand dollars and many travelling scholarships are given annually to   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  painters sculptors and architects in this country and these artists receive as well good prices for their works Poets on the contrary receive no prizes except ours no university or other institution so far as we are aware offers a scholarship for excellence in this art and few poets could live on bread and water in a hermit s cell from the pitiful income they derive from verse No artist has more need of cosmopolitan culture and experience than a poet yet the extravagantly endowed American Academy at Rome which gives bed board and a liberal income to other artists does not recognize his existence  Besides the prize winners above mentioned the committee desires to include in the honor list of the year Oct 1913 Sept 1914 the following poems Translations and poems by two members of the committee Miss Monroe and Mr Pound are withdrawn from competition  On Heaven by Ford Madox Hueffer June The Santa Fé Trail by
