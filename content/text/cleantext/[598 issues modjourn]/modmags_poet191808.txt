began under a five year endowment which expired Sept 30th 1917 and although the endowment has been partly resub scribed for another period this Fund is insufficient and expenses are constantly increasing The art of poetry requires if it is to advance not only special sympathy from a discriminating public but also endowment similar to that readily granted to the other arts All who believe in the general purpose and policy of this magazine and recognize the need and value of such an organ of the art are invited to assist thus in maintaining it   VOL XII No V  AUGUST 1918  FROM THE NEAR

Jesus heart its watch doth keep Sleep sleep my Christian babe  Green flags blow down the sky  Arahan arahan  Turk horsemen thunder nigh  Arahan  By the Dead Sea  Sleep sleep my Christian babe On these

RUG OF ISLAM  Men there are who live among flowers And the colors of the rose are known to them in the seed Even as the hands of a woman in the dark Make of the shadows a garden Filling the night of her husband with fragrance Men there are who know the stars To them the night sky is a velvet woof Crossed with the tints of jewels and April waters It is a carpet infinitely patterned Whereon the Poet God lies half dreaming Amid the perfect and the boundless Yearning for the wistfulness of things imperfect And so making the Song that is Humanity  Even so am I to the roseate carpets of the Orient  The Magic of Khorassan weavers is known to me The dyers of Khiva and Damascus And the Arabian dreamers in purple The resonant color singers of old Turkestan Have come to me out of the dim shadows Of the carpet bales Under the flickering gas jets In the back room of a little shop on upper Broadway For how long ago in the time of peace I was a rug vendor   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Nineteen Hundred and Sixteen Anno Domini And Spring bursting with young green in the parks And bird wings rhythmically weaving Into the New Earth s carpet Little mottoes of freedom Gajor wept and said You will never return And my friends in the Syrian café on Tenth Avenue Laid their hands heavily upon me But I saw only the hands of the ancient color singers beck  oning Heavier were their ghostly fingers tapping at my soul Oh never were the lips of her I love More desirous and more dear Than when she alone whispered If thou diest I die yet go  Makhir Subatu  Nineteen Hundred and Sixteen the Year of Our Lord And Spring and the Rose of Sharon blooming By crimson clotted brocks And gold tongued lilies That once with my youth answered the nightingale Now dumb beneath the moon Their white throats choked with blood Among the trampled green of olive groves Are strewn the stained girdles of young women Or wrapped about small pitifully small black mounds of  death   Ajan Syrian  Sky blue sea blue girdles of young women That once sacredly bound the Hope of a Race Waiting the loosening hands of Love And little tunics of slain children Woven through the woof like the snow flower pattern Under triumphant spring green banners Blowing from the four corners of the hills And the fringes that hold the Sacred Carpet up to Heaven The countless thick packed white fringes They are the bones of men who loved their Christ  For this is the great Prayer rug of Islam  I have seen the Turk weaving his Sacred Carpet  I have knelt on the Prayer rug of Islam  I am apostate dear Christ Christian and poet no longer lover no more  How shall I lay hands on my beloved s blue girdle  My heart is a place of swords  Ajan Syrian   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE CARPENTER  In garments dyed with blood thorn crowned alone A wistful figure on the battlefield Is by frore moonlight through the dusk revealed The mutterings of crass voices round him groan  Hearing he has not heard  A god he has not stirred To stay this shamefulness of war men say Spear pierced by scorn he passes on his way  Dark is earth s skyline scarlet dark and he  Is pale as wind blown ashes His scarred face  Droops to the slain boys in that slaughter place  His wounded hands touch all wounds tenderly  Yet when he lifts his eyes  The love light in them dies For fury he has fury and for those Who show no mercy he no mercy knows  He tramples out the wine press of his wrath  He puts the mighty down from their high seat  Time rotted tyrannies topple at his feet  Gaunt discrowned spectres flit before his path  Their doom was in his word  When first Judea heard  Of brotherhood Kings scuttle at his nod  Blown down black battles by the breath of God   James Church Alvord  The night brims up with hate and misery As from the ground at each thin blart of fire Gleam dead phosphoric eyes in deathless ire The hosts snatch freedom from their butchery  Dead no lords they fear  Dead their blue lips jeer Their cross and his drives on the smash of things The Carpenter builds scaffolds for the Kings  James Church Alvord  TH E VETERAN  We came upon him sitting in the sun Blinded by war and left And past the fence Wandered young soldiers from the Hand amp Flower Asking advice of his experience  And he said this and that and told them tales And all the nightmares of each empty head Blew into air Then hearing us beside Poor kids how do they know what it s like he said  And we stood there and watched him as he sat Turning his sockets where they went away Until it came to one of us to ask And you re how old Nineteen the third of May  Margaret I Postgate   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WAR SKETCHES  RETURN TO THE FRONT  Sleek cats in sunny doorways   He held the picture in his weary brain That he might ease his misery and pain Forget the swaying lorry and the rain  The dark was kind at any rate and yet It pressed against his eyes His feet were wet He wished that he could light a cigarette  Sleek cats in sunny doorways   He moved the water ran along his skin He wiped the drops that gathered on his chin The road grew rougher and more rain leaked in  ON THE AMBULANCE   The upper stretcher on the left hand side I mean Something felt queer behind my back Here take my pocket light  You needn t stop I ll look He s dead   Robert Redfield Jr  I thought so I shan t stop Dawn must be nearly here the star shells bloom More palely on the sky He must have died Just now   I never saw so many stars  IN MOULINS WOOD  I walk alone through a desolation where the stripped and beaten trees are mute having forgot to pray  Over the shell holes torn mouths of clay hangs the smell of gas like that of rotting pears  Silence everywhere save above where the shells pass whining on invisible grooves Surely someone is drawing heated irons across the sky  A fearful place to walk with Solitude my nerves ache Are all men dead but me or is this Death by my side  Robert Redfield Jr   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  A SONG FOR SOULS UNDER FIRE  To F L W  Lo that doves Should soften These surging streets  I found him talking simply and gladly of God In the unmoved city of granite And noise  Thought kindled in his cheek And his white faith Was the tree in spring T o look upon  He whispered me he knew the God of Daniel In the lions den The faith of Joan of Arc On parapets  He will walk a spirit Of unguessed power Into battle  He will walk unreached Into fire   Mark Turbyfill  MY HEART LIKE HYACINTH  Oh Grief is not so near to tears As I  Hurting me more than chord pain The thought of you Quiet alone Lovely as a watered reed Resting in the straightness Of your cool white bed  For I storm shattered and sick  Lie here flushed hard breathing  Oh Grief is not so near to tears  As I  THE ADVENTURER  Gatherer of shells  Flower hunter  Breather of slight winds  There is much to surprise me  I bring you songs for flutes  And odd shaped leaves  And pointed vagaries  These trinkets you may toy  And twine into your moods  Carelessly   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But I cannot tell you of what they are made Or where I found them  MELLOW  These soft hours The color of blurred pebbles And wan sand Are an old worn fringe About the breasts Of the mellow afternoon  The lilac lake Is a saucer thin Burdened with faint blue rings  The brown velvet dog Is a curved attitude Upon the lawn  Jagged in the black tree lines The frayed sun languishes A pale pink poppy Grown too large  WITHOUT CHAPERON  To S W  Frail The white moon leans To the green edged hill   Mark Turbyfill  The aspen lifts  Its tracery  Into light  The moon slips down  The edge of night  It is odd  To stand here alone  This quaking aspen  And I  THE FOREST OF DEAD TREES  I climbed up the rough mountain side Through the forest of dead trees  I touched their smooth stark limbs And learned much of the white beauty of death  Whose taut slender thigh was this And this whose gracious throat  O life you are not more beautiful Than this silent curving death is beautiful  And Eternity I think I heard it cry Centre within centre Death or Life One am I   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  BENEDICTION  Let no blasphemer till the sacred earth Or scatter seed upon it Lest fruit should fail And weed scars sting its fineness  Send him here who loves its beauty  And its brownness  He will plow the earth As a dancer dances Ecstatically  Let no blasphemer till the sacred earth Or scatter seed upon it  Mark Turbyfill   SONG OF THE VINE IN ENGLAND  Man  O Vine along my garden wall Could I thine English slumber break And thee from wintry exile disenthral Where would thy spirit wake  Vine  I would wake at the hour of dawning in May in Italy When rose mists rise from the Magra s valley plains In the fields of maize and olives around Pontrémoli When peaks grow golden and clear and the starlight wanes I would wake to the dance of the sacred mountains boundlessly Kindling their marble snows in the rite of fire To them my new born tendrils softly and soundlessly Would uncurl and aspire  I would hang no more on thy wall a rusted slumberer Listless and fruitless strewing the pathways cold I would seem no more in thine eyes an idle cumberer Profitless alien bitter and sere and old In some warm terraced dell where the Roman rioted And still in tiers his stony theatre heaves Would I festoon with leaf light his glory quieted And flake his thrones with leaves   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Doves from the mountain belfries would seek and cling to me To drink from the altar winnowing the fragrant airs Women from olived hillsides by turns would sing to me Beating the olives or stooping afield in pairs On gala evenings the gay little carts of laborers Swinging from axles their horns against evil eye And crowded with children revellers pipers and taborers Chanting would pass me by   There go the pale blue shadows so light and showery Over sharp Apuan peaks rathe mists unwreathe Almond trees wake and the paven yards grow flowery Crocuses cry from the earth at the joy to breathe There through the deep eaved gateways of haughty turreted Arno house laden bridges of strutted stalls Mighty white oxen drag in the jars rich spirited Grazing the narrow walls  Wine jars I too have filled and the heart was thrilled with me Brown limbed on shady turf the families lay Shouting they bowled the bowls and old men filled with me Roused the September twilight with songs that day Lanterns of sun and moon the young children flaunted me Plaiters of straw from doorway to window cried Borne through the city gates the great oxen vaunted me Swaying from side to side   Herbert Trench  Wine jars out of my leafage that once so vitally Throbbed into purple of me thou canst never take Thy heart would remember the towns on the branch of Italy And teaching to throb I should teach it perchance to break It would beat for those little cities rock hewn and mellowing Festooned from summit to summit where still sublime Murmur her temples lovelier in their yellowing Than in the morn of time  I from the scorn of frost and the wind s iniquity Barren aloft in that golden air would thrive My passionate rootlets draw from that hearth s antiquity Whirls of profounder fire in us to survive The serried realms of our fathers would swell and foam with us Juice of the Latin sunrise your own sea flung Rude and far wandered race might again find home with us Leaguing with old Rome young  Herbert Trench   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  T O A GREY DRESS  There s a flutter of grey through the trees Ah the exquisite curves of her dress as she passes Fleet with her feet on the path where the grass is  I see not her face I but see The swift re appearance the flitting persistence There of that flutter of grey in the distance  It has flickered and fluttered away What a teasing regret she has left in my day dream And what dreams of delight are the dreams that one may dream  It was only a flutter of grey But the vaguest of raiment s impossible chances Has set my heart beating the way of old dances  DREAMS  I  To dream of love and waking to remember you  As though being dead one dreamed of heaven and woke in hell At night my lovely dreams forget the old farewell Ah wake not by his side lest you remember too   Arthur Symons  II  I set all Rome between us with what joy I set The wonder of the world against my world s delight Rome that hast conquered worlds with intellectual might  Capture my heart and teach my memory to forget  Arthur Symons  THE WINDOWS  The windows of the little house look down the crooked lane Windows that are watching like a child s wide eyes Hopeful in the sunshine and wistful in the rain And anxious in the winter when the blown snow flies  Morning after morning I walk the fields a mile I go to town and back again I swing the little gate But though I lift my face to them the windows never smile They only look above my head and looking watch and wait  Long since my watching ended the heart thrust and the  care  It s only for the little house I keep its windows bright  And sometimes on a May day put a crimson flower there  Or a lamp that burns unshaded on a wild Fall night  Theodosia Garrison   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  GARDENS THERE WERE  Gardens there were and faces clear as agate And words I have forgotten how to speak A thousand people pass I have forgotten The things I might have said the things I seek  Roses there were a very sea of roses Zithers the sudden drawing of a breath And something passionate throbbing in the moonlight Can we remember passion after death  Gardens there were and something that was hidden  Deeper than water coursing in the earth   Beauty had filled my open hands with silver   There is a death made manifest in birth  Roses there were In many a clear dusk sweetened With frost or washed with some quick gust of rain have smelled roses and the old old longing For those lost faces comes to me again  Zithers and roses and the words forgotten  Faces that were as delicate as stone  Hewn from the hills of Greece A thousand people  Pass me and yet I know I am alone   Leslie Nelson Jennings  GOD S HOUSE  When people go to summon God Unto his earthly throne The roof whereunder God may house Must be a cry in stone  For God he will not hear a prayer That lies against the ground How shall the worm lift up to God So suppliant a sound  How shall the birds who build so small Be heard beneath the sky Or those who have no mason s hand Be shriven with a cry  Ten million spires of prayer there be In Christendom today There is no God in Lisser Wood Or on the queen s highway  And I who cannot square a stone Or lodge beneath a roof Have heard strange horns on sundown hills And seen the devil s hoof  Leslie Nelson Jennings   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  HAY  A farmer singing passed my home today On top a wagon heaped with fragrant hay  Big footed horses drew the sun sweet load In slow contentment down the shadowed road  A vagrant wind snatched little whiffs of scent And brought them to me as the wagon went  Fine largess of the fields the rustling grass  The crumpled odorous clover Jolting past  It brought the beauty of the country side Long lanes and thickets cool and meadows wide  Brought back all sweetness that in summer lies  Fragrance of flowers warmth of brooding skies  Scent of the soil and perfumes of the dew  Dank odor of the rain that filters through  Radiance of daybreak tenderness of dusk  Mist of the moonlight when pervasive musk  Of moonflower and of jasmine by the door  Enchant the silence These and greatly more  Came to me as the farmer went his way  A top his wagon heaped with sun sweet hay  Beatrice Stevens   A GIRL DANCING ON THE SHORE  Dance on dance swift to your flute s song  Girl of the setting sun The waves are wild to do you wrong  Before the dance is done But your white fleeting feet Have caught the sway and beat  Of the ocean s eager cry The wave men vainly strain To drown your slow refrain  And the flute s mellow sigh  Dance on dance swift light on the breeze You the pale sea s fair daughter The sun has set beyond the seas  In lakes of gilded water So play like tossing spray As mistily fades the day  And smoke blue shadows creep Now tread one rhythm more Then rest upon the shore  And pipe the waves to sleep  Henry C Thomas   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WITH THE WIND  My soul is borne out on the wind Through the opaqueness of her earthly case she glitters like  a sword She is free she rides her body as the whirlwind the storm She is free from the death of the flesh  Her passage is brief as the lightning As the flash of the outgoing sea gull  Or the slipping frigate She is the juggler who raises the dead  With whom the spirits speak  The soul is beautiful Proud in her beauty she laughs at  life And drinks deep of the day And she casts herself on the wing of the wind Breasting the uppermost height  ON THE HEIGHTS  It is exquisite arrived at the outermost limit No longer to thirst for anything How poignantly you yielded yourself and became intoxicated With the fierce wine of my presence Sensitively the last veil Completely melted between us   Konstantin Balmont  Oh how beautiful in the temple of the woods That irretrievable hour  From the Russian of Konstantin Balmont Translated by Edith Chapman Tracy  EASY PARTING  You are relieved and grateful  That she has made it easy for you  And so you show respect  To the gallant courage Playing up in this defeated moment  You can not see  That this is only the shell of her  Who in the long lonely nights  While beside her you slept unmindful  Knew that sometime her heart would fail  And killed herself  By tiny fragments  Years ago   Mildred Cummer Wood POETRY A Magazine of Verse  APPULDURCOMBE PARK  I am a woman sick for passion Sitting under the golden beech trees I am a woman sick for passion Crumbling the beech leaves to powder in my fingers The servants say Yes my Lady and No my Lady And all day long my husband calls me From his invalid chair Mary Mary where are you Mary I want you Why does he want me When I come he only pats my hand And asks me to settle his cushions Poor little beech leaves Slowly falling Crumbling In the great park But there are many golden beech leaves And I am alone  I am a woman sick for passion Walking between rows of painted tulips Parrot flowers toucan feathered flowers How bright you are You hurt me with your colors Your reds and yellows lance at me like flames Oh I am sick sick And your darting loveliness hurts my heart   Amy Lowell  You burn me with your parrot tongues Flame Flame My husband taps on the window with his stick Mary come in I want you You will take cold  I am a woman sick for passion Gazing at a white moon hanging over tall lilies The lilies sway and darken And a wind ruffles my hair There is a scrape of gravel behind me A red coat crashes scarlet against the lilies Cousin Captain I thought you were playing piquet with Sir Kenelm Piquet Dear Heart And such a moon Your red coat chokes me Cousin Captain Blood color your coat I am sick sick for your heart Keep away from me Cousin Captain Your scarlet coat dazzles and confuses me O heart of red blood what shall I do Even the lilies blow for the bee Does your heart beat so loud Beloved No it is the tower clock chiming eleven I must go in and give my husband his posset I hear him calling Mary where are you I want you   V  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I am a woman sick for passion Waiting in the long black room for the funeral procession  to pass I sent a messenger to town last night When will you come Under my black dress a rose is blooming A rose a heart it rustles for you with open petals Come quickly Dear For the corridors are full of noises In this fading light I hear whispers And the steady stealthy purr of the wind What keeps you Cousin Captain What was that Mary I want you Nonsense he is dead Buried by now Oh I am sick of these long cold corridors Sick for what Why do you not come  I am a woman sick sick Sick of the touch of cold paper  Poisoned with the bitterness of ink  Snowflakes hiss and scratch the windows  Mary where are you That voice is like water in my ears  I cannot empty them  He wanted me my husband   Amy Lowell  But these stone parlors do not want me You do not want me either Cousin Captain Your coat lied Only your white sword spoke the truth Mary Mary Will nothing stop the white snow Sifting Sifting Will nothing stop that voice Drifting through the wide dark halls The tower clock strikes eleven dully stifled with snow Softly over the still snow Softly over the lonely park Softly Yes I have only my slippers hut I shall not take cold A little dish of posset Do the dead eat I have done it so long So strangely long  Amy Lowell  COMMENT  SARA TEASDALE S PRIZE  OVE SONGS by Sara Teasdale published last year by the Macmillan Company has been starred by a five hundred dollar prize bestowed officially from an anonymous donor by Columbia University at the same time that this institution awarded the Pulitzer prizes of a thousand dollars each for the best play the best novel the best editorial and the best book of science of the year 1917 Miss Teasdale s or rather Mrs Filsinger s prize is for the best book of poetry published last year in this country by a citizen of the United States  But this prize is not to be credited primarily either to Columbia University or its School of Journalism Officers of the Poetry Society of America we are informed solicited the money and appointed the committee of award which consisted of William Marion Reedy Bliss Perry and Jessie  B Rittenhouse  Without disparaging the award we must say a word about this committee for questions of principle are involved For thirty years more or less American painters sculptors and architects have been fighting for the principle of professional juries in all competitions A society which pretends to stand for the great art of poetry in this country should inflexibly adopt this rule its prizes should represent the finished judgment of the most distinguished poets in its membership list The cachet of a society with so large a title   Sara Teasdale s Prize  should mean something That cachet has hitherto meant nothing because of the society s singularly provincial and haphazard way of awarding the only prizes it has given until this year the two annuals of an hundred and twenty five dollars each  No one could question Mr Reedy s competence as a judge of modern poetry but the sad fact has to be admitted that he has never confessed himself a poet Mr Perry also so far as we are aware is innocent of the art and moreover his authority as a critic and man of letters is seriously to be questioned Miss Rittenhouse has been secretary of the society from its foundation but her recent small volume of verse could hardly be accepted as evidence that she is one of the more distinguished poets on its rolls or therefore a fit member of this committee  As for the award itself the only way of forming an opinion is to examine the publishers lists for 1917 These disclose the following as the more important books of verse listed according to date of publication the possible competitors of Miss Teasdale s Love Songs  Sea Garden by H D Houghton Mifflin Co  Merlin by Edwin Arlington Robinson Macmillan Co  An April Elegy by Arthur Davison Ficke Mitchell  Kennerley  Ideal Passion by George Edward Woodberry The  Woodberry Society  These Times by Louis Untermeyer Henry Holt amp Co  Lustra by Ezra Pound Alfred A Knopf   POETRY A Magazine of V erse  War Flames by John Curtis Underwood Macmil  lan Co  Profiles from China by Eunice Tietjens Ralph Fletcher  Seymour  Asphalt by Orrick Johns Alfred A Knopf  Book of Self by James Oppenheim Alfred A Knopf  The Chinese Nightingale and Other Poems by Vachel  Lindsay Macmillan Co  Grenstone Poems by Witter Bynner Fred A  Stokes Co  Let us examine this list Possibly H D s little volume of beautiful imagist poems can not be considered because legally being the wife of an Englishman she is not a citizen of the United States Aesthetically she like Ezra Pound is intensely American in every fibre of her temperament just as Whistler was profoundly our fellow citizen in spite of his long residence abroad And aesthetic citizenship should be the criterion in such a competition as this  Mr Robinson s Merlin should certainly not win him a prize however distinguished his earlier work has been Nor is Mr Ficke s April Elegy up to his best level or to the best on this list If I were on the committee I would fight bleed and die rather than give a prize to Mr Woodberry Mr Untermeyer is not in the running nor is Mr Bynner s Grenstone Poems though some of the Celia lyrics might make it an almost Of the vers librists surely not Mr Oppenheim and the books by Mr Underwood and Mrs Tietjens might be challenged as poetic prose rather than free   Sara Teasdale s Prize  verse at any rate they can hardly compete with H D or Ezra Pound among the radicals  W e are thus left with these two radicals Mr Pound and H D and with Mr Lindsay and Mr Johns among the rhymesters as Sara Teasdale s only serious competitors during the year 1917 It may be objected that Mr Pound s Lustra was first published in London in 1916 possibly that would bar it out though I can not see why the Knopf volume does not bring it within the rules There are in Lustra certain poems Dance Figure Fish and the Shadow Ortus The Garden which have superlative magic and Mr Pound has been moreover immeasurably stimulating in modern poetic art It would be very difficult for me to vote against this book if it comes within the rules I should have to give it the preference over H D s little volume exquisite as that is in its hard clear gem like artistic purity  Among the rhymesters both Mr Lindsay s book and Mr Johns would be serious competitors of Love Songs Mr Lindsay s is a bigger thing and the instrument he plays if not finer has more richness and volume As for Mr Johns while I don t like the dialect part of his book certain other lyrics in it have for me a poetic magic of more intense and original quality than Miss Teasdale s  However Miss Teasdale s volume contains a few poems which may be ranked among the finest woman s love songs in the language and the whole book reveals with singular clarity and precision a beautiful bright spirit of rare vividness and charm Her art is of an absolute and most refresh   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ing simplicity and sincerity also except when the emotion is frayed by a tempting facility Though of an old fashion it is a fashion that endures her best lyrics certainly put it over The committee weary of discussions as to what is or isn t poetry may well have taken refuge in the certainty that good love songs have been poetry since long before Sappho chanted hers in Lesbos Whether the book should top the 1917 list or not it is certainly worthy of a prize and we offer our hearty congratulations to the poet  Mr Reedy who no doubt voted for it says of Love Songs in his Mirror It is a collection of as nearly flawless lyrics as ever were penned sheer song with the artlessness that is almost impeccable artistry Padraic Colum speaks in The New Republic for their simplicity and genuineness and their subtly intellectual quality as well and sums up his review thus  Love Songs is one of the books of verse we accept without any discussion The sincerity of the poems their clearness and their intellectual level are related to a fine courage that is always present  And Vachel Lindsay in a recent letter remarks The book deserves to be spot lighted and insists that he led the way for the committee by dedicating The Chinese Nightingale to Sara Teasdale Poet  Our thanks to the anonymous donor for the hint he has given to the late Joseph Pulitzer and the general public as well Mr Pulitzer s will creating a school of journalism at Columbia University with annual thousand dollar prizes for a novel an editorial a book of science etc omitted   Sara Teasdale s Prize  poetry Probably he never thought of it nobody was thinking of poetry during the period when his will was drawn Of course the omission of poetry from any prize list which included at least two literary products the novel and the play was preposterous and we may hope that the present donor or other donors may permanently atone for the slight with an annual prize as large as the other prizes  The poem of each year or book of poems must be we submit at least as prize worthy as the editorial of the year It may be of course of a value immeasurably greater for by the favor of the gods it may be a masterpiece an enduring work of genius a distinction which could scarcely be claimed for any editorial H M  REVIEWS  A MODERN EVANGELIST  Look We Have Come Through by D H Lawrence  D H Lawrence has recently published a third volume of poetry to stand beside his Love Poems and Amores This event has so far as I am aware passed almost without notice in the English press The reviewers of the English press know perfectly well that Mr Lawrence is supposed to be a dangerous man writing too frankly on certain subjects which are politely considered taboo in good society and therefore they do their best to prevent Mr Lawrence from writing at all by tacitly ignoring him If they are driven to the admission these selfsame reviewers are obliged grudg   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ingly to acknowledge that Mr Lawrence is one of the most interesting of modern writers Such are the conditions which a modern writer with something new to say is obliged to accept in England to day The press can make a great to do about the innocuous blameless and essentially minor poetry of Edward Thomas to take but one example they politely refuse to discuss the questionable but essentially major effort of a D H Lawrence Is it any wonder that such an attitude drives a man to sheer fanaticism  For a fine intolerant fanatic D H Lawrence undoubtedly is That is his value for our present day so rich in half measures and compromises Lawrence does not compromise In this last collection of poetry he gives us works which are not good poetry which are scarcely readable prose He includes them because they are necessary to the complete understanding of his thought and gospel We if we are wise will read them for the same reason For Lawrence is an original thinker and his message to our present day is a valuable message  Briefly the message is this that everything which we call spiritual is born and comes to flower out of certain physical needs and reactions of which the most patent is the reaction of sex through which life is maintained on this planet Lawrence therefore stands in sharp contrast to the Christian dogma of the middle ages and to those writers of the present day who still maintain an attitude of respect to the Christian view which is that we are each endowed with an immortal soul at strife with our physical needs   A Modern Evangelist  which can only be purged by death Lawrence like a recent French writer does not desire to spit out the forbidden fruit and recreate the Eden of the refusal of life He is frankly pagan To him the flesh is the soil in which the spirit blossoms and the only immortality possible is the setting free of the blossoming spirit from the satiated flesh When this is accomplished then the spirit becomes free perfect unique a habitant of paradise on earth This is the doctrine of which he is the zealot the intolerant apostle  Th e specific value of this idea need not concern us very greatly The question is rather of its poetical value and there is no doubt that it is a system of philosophy which is essentially poetical Poetry is at once highly objective and highly subjective It is objective in so far as it deals with words which are in a strong sense objects and with the external world in its objective aspects It is subjective because it also states the poet s subjective reactions to words and to all external phenomena Lawrence is one of the few poets in England to day who keeps this dual rôle of poetry well in mind and that is why his poetry though it may often be badly written is never without energy and a sense of power  The reason for his failings as a poet must be sought elsewhere than in his attitude to life We can only understand why he fails if we understand the conditions under which he is forced to write With a reasonable degree of independence a public neither openly hostile nor totally indifferent an intellectual milieu capable of finer life and better understand   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ing Lawrence would become nothing but an artist He has none of these things and so he is forced by destiny itself to become the thing he probably began by loathing a propagandist a preacher an evangelist  This brings him into close connection with Walt Whitman who similarly spent his life in preaching with puritanical fervor a most unpuritan gospel Indeed if one examines closely Lawrence s latest technique as shown here in such poems as Manifesto and New Heaven and Earth one is surprised to see how close this comes in many respects to that of the earlier Whitman the Whitman of The Song of Myself For example note the selfsame use of long rolling orchestral rhythm in the two following passages  When Í gathered flowers I knew it was myself plucking my own flowering When I went in a train I knew it was myself travelling by my own invention When I heard the cannon of the war I listened with my own ears  to my own destruction When I saw the torn dead I knew it was my own torn dead body It was all me I had done it all in my own flesh  Every kind for itself and its own for me mine male and female For me those that have been boys and that love women For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted For me the sweet heart and the old maid for me mothers and the  mothers of mothers For me lips that have smiled eyes that have shed tears For me children and the begetters of children  The difference is and this too is curiously brought out in the technique that Lawrence is more delicate more sensitive more personal He deliberately narrows his range to   A Modern Evangelist  embrace only life and his own life in particular Unlike Whitman he has a horror of the infinite and I am sure that he could never bring himself to utter the word Democracy the word en masse He is an aristocrat an individualist and indeed he has only a horror of the collective mass of mankind which he sees and in this case he sees more clearly than Whitman to have been always conservative conventional timid and persecutors of genius In fact the only similarity is that both he and Whitman are preachers of new gospels and therefore are obliged to adopt a similar tone of oratory in their work  For this reason Lawrence in his best poetry is unquotable as is the case with all poets who depend rather on the extension of emotion than on its minute concentration But now and again he produces something that seems to transform all the poetry now written in English into mere prettiness and feebleness so strong is the power with which his imagination pierces its subject Such a poem for example is the one called The Sea I have space for only its last magnificent stanza  You who take the moon as in a sieve and sift Her flake by flake and spread her meaning out You who roll the stars like jewels in your palm So that they seem to utter themselves aloud You who steep from out the days their color Reveal the universal tint that dyes Their web who shadow the sun s great gestures and expressions So that he seems a stranger in his passing Who voice the dumb night fittingly Sea you shadow of all things now mock us to death with your  shadowing   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The man who wrote this and many other passages in this volume has at last arrived at his maturity the maturity of the creative artist who is able to grasp a subject through its external aspect and internal meaning simultaneously and to express both aspects in conjunction before the subject is laid aside John Gould Fletcher  AN ENGLISH SOLDIER POET  Ardors and Endurances by Robert Nichols Frederick A  Stokes Co  The contents of this volume are divided into three Books the first presenting war poems The design on the outer cover is appropriate to the hour the frenzied face of war a reproduction from the drawing of a Fury by Michelangelo The heroic title may come from the lines  My heart demands in grief Ardor endurance and relief  or the lines may be the offspring of the title  It is always with a tender awe that I touch a book by a soldier And this young soldier is so winningly frank and boyish he takes us so into his confidence He tells us what he has read in some passages that he has quenched his thirst from the goblet of Keats in others that Milton has led him by the hand and this influence of the past does not necessarily injure the poems it stamps However Mr Nichols forms a veritable case for the modern surgeon of poetry for we find him using throughout his work such expressions as in sooth I wis Hist draws he   An English Soldier Poet  nigher lush meadows sentinel palm etc It is rather late in the day for a young poet to begin thus even though man y now sophisticated moderns wrote in much the same way when they were young With Mr Nichols the substance often prevails over the manner though the noble dreams and clear aspirations which fill this book and give us memorable lines are set to a pattern of thought frequently as conventional as its patterns of style  This is not to say that each of the poems is in the old manner of thinking and writing There is a stirring freshness often words are used originally and we discover vital words new to poetry It has been said that modern methods make egoists of the mediocre If so Robert Nichols would not suffer from adopting them The man who wrote these lines is a man to be reckoned with  Hunger is in my heart  I stretch my arms out and I kiss  The whole world s dark and simple face  Much has been said about the writing of poetry dealing with the war a virtue has even been made of the power of some poets to draw away from the subject entirely Now when the foundations of the world are rocking with war when we cannot help absorbing war every blood stained minute that poetical thought should be able to detach itself completely from war would seem to be something of a miracle Nichols lines ring with the intensity and fire of the thick of the fight The Day s March is a notable example so is Noon The Assault is a striking account of an infantry advance amid a hurricane of shell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Fragments fly Rifles and bits of men whirled at the sky  Book 11 contains A Faun s Holiday a long poem in the classical manner which has a certain youthful power and charm Book III Poems and Phantasies shows like power and a keen sense of the beautiful The Hill gives the feeling of the Virgin Mother as she enfolds the Christchild with her love and forecasts his iron hour Perhaps the best piece of descriptive writing in this collection is The Tree showing the crooked creaking tree as its loaded bough dips and the body of Judas falls and lies on the grass facing the sky the flies dizzily swinging over its winkless eyes Goya himself has painted no stronger picture There are good songs and crude songs In Change we have the emotion of a man as his spirit projects itself with the outflowing tide Here the metre is perhaps more varied than in many of the other poems The reader will delight in a quaint Pierrot poem which leaves its moonshine moonshine in the head There is beauty in Boot III as in Book II but it is Bookthat most of us will remember longest  Agnes Lee Freer  A PRAIRIE POET  Barbed Wire and Other Poems by Edwin Ford Piper The  Midland Press  One who takes up Barbed Wire from a book counter expecting a collection of war poems will find nothing of the sort These are simply poems of the prairies   A Prairie Poet  It has been said that The Well Digger is equal to anything Frost has done and I remember wincing whenheard the book as a whole pronounced better than Spoon River to my thinking all approach to Spoon River being barred As to the latter comparison I find no trace of Masters in Mr Piper s work except perhaps in the last part of The Boy on the Prairie and in his introduction of many names The resemblance at the author s best is to Frost with Frost s fine charm left out Yet the resemblance may be chance and if subtle charm be lacking we have force to take its place The work has an elemental sweep that spurs the reader to turn page after page Tired of bewildering controversies of the eternal question Is this poetry I can only say that while to me many of the lines and stanzas are but powerful statements of fact Mr Piper is a poet One is carried far and irresistibly by his masterful insight into western life He has a good supply of fresh strong words with which to paint in graphic pictures his sketches and stories of the starkness monotony and beauty of prairies His descriptions are not those of a mere looker on one feels that he has been the farmer tearing the corn from heavy husks that the groaning axle has told him things that he has been a part of the struggle of man and that he has sounded the dependence of man upon beast There are beautiful descriptions of night on the prairie of cooling dews of delicious fragrance  Almost all of the poems are written in blank verse with a very few lyrics in shorter metre and rhymed bringing a   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  welcome variety of form It seems strange that one otherwise emancipated should use the inversion and such expressions as glimpsed did she clearly sense tis spite of grasses wild ere did roar etc Whether or not these still have their place in certain lyrical work in Mr Piper s broad untethered style they jab the sight as uncomfortably as isinglass flashed before it in the sun  At the Post Office The Well The Claim Jumper and The Ridge Farm are notable But I think the best poem in the book and one to be read more than once is In The Canyon the chronicle of a woman who literally died of loneliness as strong an expression as I have ever read of the need of the human heart for companionship I call it poetry from beginning to end  Martha a childless widow whom some freak of destiny has sent to the canyon faces the months in a spot where a dugout could be cheaply made far from any buildings She longs to see people The only break in her monotony is a monthly trip to town or the perusing of patent cure all advertisements which she brings home to read or the borrowing of the county paper If I could see your house and watch mine she said once to a distant neighbor whom kindliness had brought to her door The canyon seems a trap closing her in She keeps a diary Better to write than mutter to myself is one of the jottings This diary keeps pace with the narrative and through it we apprehend the full horror of her need  The little lamp cast all the shadows up A road   A Prairie Poet  Bears witness men have passed makes promises That men will come If I lived by a road  Out here the stars are always near at hand The air is stirless fearing the least noise I wonder that my heart can beat so loud I long to free my senses with a shriek  And this description of the deserted soddy is the poet s  final word  Down the steep slope With the brown bunchgrass swishing round your knees The rusty stovepipe rises through a beard Of starveling herbage A mat of tumble weeds In the doorway is o erhung with bluestem blades They blot the path to the well The garden place Bristles with ragweed at one corner spire Red and white hollyhocks and the dying souls Of damask roses drench the sultry noon  Agnes Lee Freer  ART VERSUS FORMULAE  Poems of Charles Warren Stoddard collected by Ina Coolbrith John Lane Co First Offering Sonnets and Lyrics by Samuel Roth Lyric Pub Co Gardens Overseas and Other Poems by Thomas Walsh John Lane Co Beggar and King by Richard Butler Glaenzer Yale Univ Press  Ships in Port by Lewis Worthington Smith G P Putnam s Sons Mr Stoddard s verse probably gave pleasure to him and  to his many friends during his lifetime It is now a record   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of the man for them and as such is treasured Mr Stod  dard himself it is said did not overestimate its value It  belongs to the period of the eighteen seventies and eighties  a period which seems now to have been singularly complacent  and colorless so far as poetry is concerned Of course one  excepts Whitman who was then living but whose work had  long passed the stage of gestation The most spontaneous  thing in the book is the little poem called Wind and Wave  Oh when I hear at sea The water on our lee I fancy that I hear the wind That combs my hemlock tree  But when beneath that tree I listen eagerly I seem to hear the rushing wave I heard far out at sea  And I can not forbear quoting from the preface this memo  rial poem by Joaquin Miller for the charm of its fresh  nonchalant directness  Say Charlie our Charlie say What of the night A lo ha Hail What noonful sea What restful sail Where tent you Bedouin today O generous green leaves of our tree What fruitful first young buoyant 3 ear But bleak winds blow the leaves are sere And listless rustle two or three  Say Charlie where is Bret and Twain Shy Prentice and the former few You spoke and spoke as one who knew Now Charlie speak us once again The night wolf prowls we guess we grope But day is night and night despair And doubt seems some unuttered prayer And hope seems hoping against hope   Art vs Formulae  But Charlie you had faith and you Gentlest of all God s gentlemen You said you knew and surely knew Now speak and speak as spoke you then  The author of First Offerings Mr Samuel Roth is still very young to judge from the title and internal evidence He is at present locked in an academic chrysalis using words and phrases of stock poetic parlance that are so far as poetry is concerned quite meaningless He is using false counters cloaking his feeling with abstractions words like valor despair eternity immortality and corresponding phrases that sound so well to youth and convey so little Of course the poet may wake up one never can tell It is quite impossible to predict what his future development may be at this stage He comes nearest to personal expression in A Song of Earth which is unfortunately marred by the line Earth than which there is no purer joy  Both Mr Walsh and Mr Glaenzer write as if they belonged to the same poetic stock and generation as Mr Stoddard Their verse does not seem to touch reality at any point It is impersonal verse one can read it through without knowing any more of the author than when one began In art Tagore says man reveals himself and not his objects His objects have their place in books of information and science where he has completely to conceal himself Much poetry is like a sort of pseudo science in this respect It is as unreal as if the poet had used chemical symbols for emotional reactions as personally inexpressive as a geography which describes boundaries and countries but gives nothing of the soul of landscape We know that both Mr Walsh   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and Mr Glaenzer have enjoyed their landscapes but they have not transmuted this enjoyment in such a way as to make us feel it Mr Roth says H 2 O when he means water  Mr Smith s verse is even farther removed from reality than that of the preceding authors It is conventional magazine verse fluent rhythmical facile The magazine poet has his reward on earth he does not have to wait for it in heaven so he can probably afford to ignore adverse criticism Mr Smith is at his best in poems approaching the ballad form as in Aglavaine published in POETRY  A C H  VERSES BOND AND FREE  Elegy in Autumn by Clinton Scollard Fred Fairchild  Sherman New York  Writing an elegy may be a pious task and it is in that spirit that Mr Scollard has paid due tribute to his friend and fellow poet Frank Dempster Sherman of happy memory  Youth has its visions and its fervors yours Were lovingly enlinked with Poesy You dreamed the dream that many an one allures The vernal dream where life is harmony  And so on the proper poetic things are said in the proper poetic way through two dozen stanzas until we come in the last one to the amaranth and the asphodel and know that he task is done  But what has this to do with poetry H M   Verses Bond and Free  Common Men and Women by Harold W Gammans Four Seas Co Certain books of alleged free verse floor me I confess  I wish I could penetrate the rhythmic secret which enables the poet to cut his meditations into lines or the imaginative secret which enables him to call the result a poem Here for example is Saving a Nickel which begins  A walk of a mile or two Would save five cents  And ends after an encounter with a tramp  I gave him a quarter Though I was walking to save five cents Perhaps Lady Ocean represents a closer encounter with the muse It ends with this pleasing image  I d say you were asleep But your white toes Keep gripping at the sand  Fail Work Fail says the poet only he puts it in three lines Well failure may be heroic H M  In the Red Years by Gervé Baronti Four Seas Co  Not being able to see a gleam in this book beyond the clever frontispiece drawing I passed it on to another with this result  The author expresses feelings which he thinks he ought to feel never genuine The radical verses at the start are nothing but rhetoric How I Love etc nothing but journalistic description Morning Song is perhaps the best but poor enough  Evidently Mr Baronti is not appreciated in this office  H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WAR POETRY AGAIN  A Treasury of War Poetry edited by George Herbert  Clarke Houghton Mifflin Co Poems of the Great War selected by J W Cunliffe For the Benefit of the Belgian Relief Scholarship Committee Macmillan Co The war itself is not responsible for the many bad poems  of which it is the occasion even as love is not to blame for the many indiscretions in verse committed in its name 1 he fine poem about war as about love is the exceptional one and only a small number of all the poems now being written about the war and only a very small number of those included in these two anthologies will we may venture to believe be included in the anthologies of fifty or a hundred years hence But the sifting will necessarily be gradual and the editors of these two volumes have done us a good service in beginning it The two books supplement each other for the selections differ except for those more notable poems on the war which everyone knows Rupert Brooke s sonnets Alan Seeger s I Have a Rendezvous with Death the early war poems of Kipling and Hardy Chesterton s The Wife of Flanders Vachel Lindsay s Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight and other poems with which the public is now generally familiar Of course the first tiling one does on reviewing an anthology is to look for the omissions Ford Madox Hueffer s Antwerp must be included in any final anthology of war poems and so must some of John Curtis Underwood s War Flames published later than Mr Cunliffe s   War Poetry Again  selection One notes also the absence of John Masefield s August 1914 an omission for which the editors presumably may not be responsible since authors and publishers also have something to say about what shall or shall not go into an anthology A C H  A Book of Verse on the Great War edited by W Reginald Wheeler with a foreword by Charlton M Lewis Yale  Univ Press The Muse in Arms edited by E B Osborn Fred A Stokes Co Fifes and Drums Poems of America at War Geo H Doran Co  Mr Wheeler s principle of selection is not unlike Mr Clarke s and Mr Cunliffe s an effort to bring together the best war poetry as yet written It omits some of the general favorites above mentioned and includes a few translations from Emile Cammaerts and Edmond Rostand and poems by Sarojini Naidu Henry Newbolt and others who are not often quoted Among these is W N Ewer whose Five Souls is one of the most moving poems of the present war It begins with this stanza from the First Soul a Russian and continues with stanzas from an Austrian a Frenchman a German and a Scotchman all ending with the same refrain  I was a peasant of the Polish plain I left my plow because the message ran Russia in danger needed every man To save her from the Teuton and was slain I gave my life for freedom this I know For those who bade me fight had fold me so   POETRY A Magazine of V erse  As Mr Lewis informs us in his platitudinous preface Mr Wheeler has considerately admitted to his collection a few specimens of what is strangely called the new poetry For example Miss Lowell s Bombardment  The Muse in Arms is as its title implies poems written chiefly in the field of action a more complete collection than the Soldier Poems reviewed last year in POETRY It contains a good deal of mere journalism but also more entries of really poetic quality by men known and unknown than one would expect to find coming straight from the front  Fifes and Drums represents last year s first American reaction to the call to arms The poems were written under the immediate stress of great events by those who have banded themselves together under the name of The Vigilantes The book is interesting as impassioned rhymed eloquence but none of the poems rises to lyric beauty  H S M CORRESPONDENCE  A SPECTRAL GHOST  Editors of POETRY In your June issue A C H contends that Spectra then proves nothing against the method of free verse as such though it may hit off very cleverly some of the practitioners thereof May I call the attention of A C H to the fact that all but one or two of Emanuel Morgan s contributions to Spectra are what might be called   A Spectral Ghost  rhymed jingles and to this paragraph from the book s preface  Emanuel Morgan has fourni the best expression of his genius in regular metrical forms and rhyme Anne Knish on the other hand has used only free verse We wish to make it clear that the spectric manner does not necessitate the employment of either of these metrical systems to the exclusion of the other  Our intent in publishing the book was not to question the use of free verse and not to bait the public but to satirize fussy pretence and if we have in any degree focussed laughter on pomp and circumstance among poets we shall have had enough satisfaction in our fun I frankly admit that my approach to the game may have been with an excess of impatience but I ask you if it is not true that I who came to scoff remained to play Having given vent to Witter Bynner s irritation at smug and pedantic pretences Emanuel Alorgan soon found himself a liberated identity glad to be agog with a sort of laughing or crying abandon of which in other poets the New England soul of Witter Bynner had been too conscientiously suspicious And so I am eager for a chance in the pages of POETRY to make amends for whatever may have been unworthy in Witter Bynner s intention and manners and to thank the editors of POETRY Others The Little Review and Reedy s Mirror for their encouragement  After various inaccurate and unjust statements in the  press let me say here accurately and justly that I think  now of my later work even better than you do that I count  on having the readers of POETRY place my hand in your   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  when they read the group of my verses you have accepted  and then place your hand in mine when they read if they  will my new volume Songs of the Beloved Stranger which  1 am going to publish not pretentiously but seriously and  well aware of the likelihood that some of the critics may  mock it according to their cue  Yours more than ever Emanuel Morgan  Noie by the Editor Thanks for your thanks Emanuel But has POETRY ever printed you or so much as mentioned Spectra It was a pleasure to accept the poems of so clever a joker but why all this hand clasping  But don t be proud don t quite obliterate Mr Bynner Have you read Mr Arthur J Eddy s tribute to you and Miss Knish in Reedy s Mirror Believe me he says they are not half bad No one can read them without being instantly impressed with the importance of the so called burlesques as revelations of the real Bynner and the real Ficke and if all the poems are as good as the few printed in the Times delightful revelations they are of two personalities who are betrayed to be more human more natural more hail fellow well met than their serious verse indicates them to be And by conventional standards their serious verse is good good but conscious while their burlesques are the gleeful outpourings of their unrestrained say boyish selves Their burlesques are their own while their serious verse is largely literature traditional How true this is of Ficke s sonnets many of them fine attempts to cast the thoughts and feelings of an Iowa lawyer fa good one in Roman mold Admirable as attempts but why try to fit the youth the surge the radicalism of America into the most rigid of antique armors  I should say both Bynner and Ficke simply broke loose in their burlesques and for the first time in their lives abandoned their literary pose under the cover of pseudonyms just as many another man has been able best to express himself anonymously  Notes  NOTES  Only four of the poets of this number have appeared before in POETRY Miss Amy Lowell needs no introduction her latest book of verse is Men

time Ditto Mr Mark Turbyfill a young Chicagoan now in the service Ditto Mr Arthur Symons the distinguished English poet who after a long silence seems to have renewed his youth during the last two or three years  Another distinguished English poet Mr Herbert Trench appears for the first time in POETRY His first book of verse Dierdre Wedded was published in London in 1901 followed in 1907 by New Poems Apollo and the Seaman etc Poems with Fables in Prose whose most important poem is The Battle of the Marne has just appeared In 1910 Mr Trench was director of one of the London art theatre companies which gave a beautiful production of The Bluebird by Maeterlinck but he is now living in Settignano near Florence His poems so far as I know have not been published in America though one of the finest of them is a tribute to Poe contributed to a London weekly at the time of the Poe centenary  Miss Theodosia Garrison of Elizabeth N J is the author of three or four books of verse of which the latest The Dreamers and Other Poems published last year by Geo H Doran amp Co was recently reviewed in POETRY  The other poets of this month have not yet published volumes or appeared much in

POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Miss Edith Chapman Tracy of Milwaukee the translator of the Balmont poems sends the following note about their author from Chapter VI of Russia and the Russians by H W Williams  The modernist movement expressed itself most distinctly as a poetical revival and the leaders in this revival were Balmont and Briusov the former half consciously the latter of deliberate purpose Konstantin Balmont is a poet for the sheer love of the music of poetry  During the revolutionary period Balmont wrote political verse He has consequently been compelled since 1906 to live abroad chiefly in Paris and exile has had a paralyzing effect upon a talent of rare spontaneity Balmont has translated into Russian the works of many foreign poets including Calderon Shelley Ibsen and Poe He knows foreign languages well but is too subjective to be a good translator and his version of the English poet is much more suggestive of Balmont than Shelley The English poet whom Balmont most resembles in quality though not in range of talent is Swinburne  Balmont is the author of Free Russia the new national hymn of the Russian republic  BOOKS RECEIVED  ORIGINAL VERSE  Arma Virumque by
