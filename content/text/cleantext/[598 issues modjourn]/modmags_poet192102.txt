garland on your hair I drink your beauty  Your soul is clothed By your body Your limbs are swathed and clothed Your face is covered With shadows Still I drink I drink   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  My greedy soul sips the beauty Of each curve so delicate My eyes are golden bees Your mouth s a rosy flower Hold your body for your lover I delve For dearer treasures  From your fortress threefold I will steal you for my own Thinner softer dearer I will shape your limbs for me And coil and uncoil your speckled hair  Lightning rifts the face of the sky Little glints between the shadows Little holes in the face of the sky Stars Eyes   From some place behind the partition comes the peculiar giggle of a woman  Madame This hat makes your face A flower  The Woman But I have told you I can not Whispering

OFFICERS MESS 1916  I  I search the room with all my mind Peering among those eyes For I am feverish to find A brain with which my brain can talk Not that I think myself too wise But that I m lonely and I walk Round the large place and wonder No There s nobody I fear Lonely as I and here  How they must hate me I m a fool I can t play bridge I m bad at pool I cannot drone a comic song I can t talk shop I can t use slang My jokes are bad my stories long My voice will falter break or hang Not blurt the sour sarcastic word And so my swearing sounds absurd  II  But came the talk I found Three or four others for an argument I forced their pace They shifted their dull ground And went   Sprawling about the passages of thought We tugged each other s words until they tore They asked me my philosophy I brought Bits of it forth and laid them on the floor They laughed and so I kicked the bits about Then put them in my pocket one by one I sorry I had brought them out They grateful for the fun  And when those words of ours had thus been sent Jerking about like beetles round a wall Then one by one to dismal sleep we went There was no happiness at all In that short hopeless argument Through yawns and on the way to bed Among men waiting to be dead  Harold Monro   THAT YEAR  ANODYNE  The days wear thin with longing There is a warmth in emptiness My palms have pressed so long Against the fragile surface Of these lonely hours Almost I touch your fingers Almost I hear your voice I stand in the shadow of your absence Looking through windows of sunlight Soon soon you will be fashioned Out of my longing You will live from the breath Of my desire  LITTLE THINGS  Little things I ll give to you Till your fingers learn to press Gently On a loveliness  Little things and new Till your fingers learn to hold   Love that s fragile Love that s old  I GIVE SMILES  You are the reaching out in me The supplication of my folded hands You are the breaking radiance of my hope My high desire  I will give you a gay futility of smiles For I cannot fill the vastnesses With which you stretch my life To emptiness  WITHOUT WORDS  The silence thins out falls away Before a vivid stillness That we press Nearer with words We say our usual ritual close the day With laughter while the stillness spreads A halo round our nodding heads Again we praise the little past praise what is done Cling to the days we ve lost And lose the hour we ve won   HIGH DIVE  Shoot from the thought of fear Into the air Taut as if crucified on to Infinite space Down through a shaft Of wind A vivid streaking void Hit The water at last Brings back myself To me  MARRIAGE CAPRICE  Let us not linger over a good bye It is not fitting That in this too casual life I who called you wife So many weeks ago Should stretch past glory Into present woe You are not more to me Leaning now against the lintel of my door And quavering your stagy Nevermore to live with you You are not more to me Than a familiarity of face And figure   You ask if I remember That Sunday in December Why treat finality Elaborately Weaving an intricate fatuity of sighs and words About a simple ending Pretending that we Achieve tragedy  Quietly you cross the room assume That I am unaware of every beauty that there is In you We can be friends oh God you touch my hand In the accustomed way  And so  In the accustomed way it ends You do not go We are not friends And so it ends  MISERERE  Little grief come with me Into a quiet place That we may play Together  O little grief warm My loneliness   POETRY A Magazine of Verse KINDNESS Part the curtains gently Let them fall In soft finalities of color After you Let there be no certainty ofBetween us Part the curtains gently doors I hold out my hands And my life goes from me I draw my thought Through a profusion of vanities And am not comforted I am a sleep walker Within this sunlit room You have done as I have bidden you And the act is heavy With kindness There is no certainty of doors Between us I grope for a beginning Or an end Marion Strobel    COMMUNION  I have spoken with the dead From the silence of my bed I have heard them in the night Their voices are as white As altar candles Their voices are as gold as wheat And clustered in the dark their words are sweet As ripened fruit Their voices are the color of dim rain Over grass where spring has lain Their speaking is an orchard of delight I have heard them in the night Their lips bloomed into heavy song That hung like bells above me You are wrong Who say the dead lie still  I heard them sing until  The cup of silence fell in two and lay  Broken by beauty of what dead men say  There is no loveliness I cannot see  There is no wall too stern for me  There is no door that can withstand  The lifted symbol of my hand  I know an ancient shibboleth  I pass for I have talked with Death  Hildegarde Flanner   VIGIL  My fathers bones lie buried deep In ribbed rock and shifting sea And yet my fathers vigil keep Above the sentience that is me  Along my brain s white commisures Their lives a subtle lightning play Lighting the dusk in which endures The psychic something that was they  Within my farthest consciousness The lightnings flash electrons move And sweep from unformed lifelessness To life which bids me hate and love  REQUIEM  In dreamless uncomplaining sleep Beside the dreaming sea she lies Untouched by lyric loveliness Of bird and wave and windy skies  Yet loving loveliness she made More lovely all she gazed upon And every May shall plead her cause With silence and oblivion  Wade Oliver   THE FOOL  He was an angel luckless to be born Into our darker world and dimmer plan Although he wore the body of a man  It looked like clothes at second hand so worn That worldlier people pushed him by in scorn  Patient he set his clock as our clocks ran And faithfully each day its task began Night found him still beginning as at morn  He lost his job No foreman could forgive The hand that built for dream and not for pay Try as he might he came at last to naught A lonely statue crumbling day by day Which somehow woke an echo in our thought Of life forgotten in the greed to live  Horace Holley   POEMS  CHALLENGE  I called But you answered not  You who answer the wind And the moan of the tossing tree You who answer the black whispers of night And the vehement voice of the sea  I call you Answer me  THE COMPANION  You are the wave that ever Batters our lonely shore You are in each sweet fruit The bitter core You are the night that smothers The day s last gleam And in the peace of sleep You are the fitful dream You are the blackness hovering In the heart of each golden flame You are the threat ever changing Yet ever the same You stand at the end of each path   Emmy Veronica Sanders  The immovable dumb rock of slate You are the weariness Halting our leaden gait Yours is the voice of the wind Over the frozen plain And the dark hand of the Sower Sowing the seed of pain You are the mist that hides The promise of far green hills And on each budding faith You are the frost that kills  You are the Chastising Rod You are the Reckoning  You are the Shadow that follows  Each Thing  ADELAIDE CRAPSEY  You whom Death wrung  That you might thus achieve  Crystalline drops of beauty  Do not grieve  That from the sun drenched purple places  They gathered you so soon   Envy us not who may With withered faces Watch the gray night suspend a haggard moon   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FORTY SECOND STREET  I stand and stare Peace is somewhere Peace of the big blue spaces   Like fists the brutal lights on white and weary faces Fall fiercely through the livid air A dull roar rises from the seething places Where cold eyed slaves driven by cold eyed masters Six million hunted beings dwell Six million shapes from a machine made hell Push past through filth and icy sleet Push down and up and ever up and down The Street  God rid me of these wan unholy faces  I stand and stare  Peace is somewhere  Peace of the big blue spaces   Somewhere far in the fells I know The aged pines with heads bent low And folded hands like solemn congregations  Receive the silent sacrament of snow   Somewhere the stillness is so deep that you can hear Planets and stars gliding through crystal spaces Clear burning in the frozen halls of time    Emmy Veronica Sanders  I stand and stare At this mad pushing of a million feet At this wild thronging of the withered faces At this foul nightmare of The Street  Somewhere is Peace Peace of the wide blue spaces   DRIFTWOOD  To the dim lit shore of the mind  Strange things come drifting When the tide is high  To the shore of the mind  Little waves run  Lifting With a murmured melody  Frail forms that slip  From unknown isles away into the night  In the gray twilight  On a crest of foam  Strange shapes are flung Without name without home  On the shore of the mind Strange things are spread When the tide runs high  Before eyes that are blind   POETRY A Magazine of Verse Pale things that lie Dead On the edge of the mind HILLTOP DUET The Tree Old Vagabond Wind Will you never take root Will you never settle down To the soil And bear fruit The Wind Old Stay at home Tree Will you never take wing Will you never break loose And roam free Like a king Both The earth is for you And the air is for me But the poor little fishes Those little white fishes Must stay in the sea In the cold slimy sea Brrr Emmy Veronica Sanders    AN INTIMATE OF NIGHT  I am an intimate of night Its deep and dewy silences Its starry parallels of light Orion and the Pleiades  I share the watches of the moon Its golden witcheries I share The secrets of the winds that croon Down purple chasms of the air  The lunar moth with emerald wings I know its path I know its goal The lone night thrush s rapturings And all the passion of its soul  The gleaming glow worm in the grass Withholds no cryptic spell from me I sense all attars as they pass Their source their fragrant mystery  I am as one who walks alone Through shadowed gardens of delight Seeing the Great Will on its throne I am an intimate of night  Clinton Scollard   THREE SONGS  UNFAILING  When like a flower your loved one lies Beneath the grasses Sleeping the great sleep  Go out unlonely to the folding hills They will not let you weep  When one by one your dreams have stolen by And blackness fills the night And pain and care  Reach up for comfort to the leaning sky The coming of the dawn is still a prayer  RAIN  I  The golden sun is garish On the white wall of the day I close my eyes against it For a vision cool and gray  Gray fissued and gray skirted She sweeps across the plain And wraps me in her softness O Rain my mother Rain   Frances Shaw  A soft gray wall of rain Shuts all the world away The voices of the toilers The urgent thoughts of day As silence or as night It closes me about And shields me in a solitude That shuts the loud world out  I care not for the sun Or where the winds blow free I love the folds of rain The mist enclosing me Frances Shaw  QUATRAIN  As old I am as that white throbbing star Young as these herbs of spring that quickly pass My soul goes up the pathway of the star My feet go down the pathway of the grass  Anna Spencer Twitchell   THE SOCIALIST S MARRIAGE  Into the sunless office Of the impoverished Onward Where sat a frugal tailor Long risen before his shop bell Painfully writing leaders For the beloved propaganda  Entered a sound of singing A gust of fresh air blowing And past the presses walking A bride in a bright white dress  Herself like early woodflowers So thrilling pale and fragrant Unveiled she was and barefoot Her hair was bright and burning Her shadowy eyes most tender  As thus the orphan Poverty Came to her long trothed lover I think I saw before them The shadow of Saint Francis Rise up to be their groomsman  Sarah N Cleghorn   THE WAY THINGS GO  ENDLESS CIRCLE  The tree we lay under The thunder the thunder Of my heart and your wonder And our weeping   Now we are old we are worn we are weary of sleeping There s an end to all sorrow there must be an end to our weeping Come with me fly with me find with me laughing and leaping  The tree lue lay under  The thunder the thunder  Of my heart and your wonder And our weeping  SEA CHANGE  You are no more but sunken in a sea Sheer into dream ten thousand leagues you fell And now you lie green golden while a bell Swings with the tide my heart And all is well Till I look down and wavering the spell Your loveliness returns There in the sea Where you lie amber pale and coral cool You are most loved most lost most beautiful   TROPICAL GIRL TO HER GARDEN  Withhold your breath Heavy in noon and sleepy as slow death Garden of sweets and sours The cluster of my body hangs Odorous with flowers Stamen serpent fangs Sultry in showers  Withhold your hand My boughs are bent with gold my face is fanned With wings of bees that thirsting curve and kiss Under green leaves green tendrils coil and hiss Gloom laden branches bear me down too much My yellow fruit will fall without a touch From hanging long in sultriness like this  MOONRISE MOCKERY  Move nearer lover Fearful of me and the moon I have put flowers in my bosom for you For you I am remembering Hundreds of moons Half a hundred lovers For you I am heavy with the odor of love And old days   Genevieve Taggard  ZENITH  You and all the bulk of the huge sky Crush me flat my body on the sand Until I fling out my hands to clutch the little grains Until I struggle to see the little stars Until I try to think Of the names of little lifeless things  I can escape to when this is over  MARRIED  Your face from my face slips Lover of my lips  Holder of my heart  For all our close companionships  We are apart  Apart apart we are apart  Crying beauty leaves me dumb  Your fire cold and still  I watch the hours of morning come  And always will  With this dull agony in my heart  We are apart  Strong solemn stupid kind  Parting we leave behind  Silence where our footsteps sound  Dead on the hollow ground   With a singing river I used to run Wild with wonder now There is no river there is no sun Only an old vow  And this dull chant goes through my head And this dull moan sinks in my heart  Half of my body must be dead We are apart  DROUTH  You cannot persuade us to stand lovely and unseasonal Perpetual spring and perpetual winter Forever drifting petals across the picture of your existence  Frames we can never be for the miniature of your days Nor can we decorate your sky With a single branch of us chosen for the dashed loveliness  you prefer  Nor can we die petal by petal by petal Across thirty years as you would have us Decorating by our death The design of your days  SATURDAY AFTERNOON  Oh if my soul were lifted like a tree Up from the little stones that lie on me   Genevieve Taggard  If I could stand Still on the hill and never move my hand No never beckon no nor wave my dress But only wait in heavy breathlessness Just stand Still on the hill and never move my hand He might come up for balm he might go down Careless and comforted to town  LOST  Forever lost like birds forever flying Searching bleak space Circling and with the south wind crying Across earth s face  Arrowed I fly and like them lost forever Having once seen Scarlet in a jungle by a deep river Scarlet and green  FOUND  I have moved west I travel with the sun You cannot hold you cannot hinder me There is no end for what I have begun There are no resting places where I run Until I am surrendered to the sea  Genevieve Taggard  POETRY A Magazine of Verse COMMENT  NOTES AND QUERIES FROM MR LINDSAY  MR VACHEL LINDSAY having recently returned from England the editor asked him for an article setting forth anything he might wish to say about the trip the poets his recitals his audiences what he thought of them or they of him Having heard through Mr Aldington of one recital at the Poetry Book shop at which various young English poets listened to The Congo and The Kalliope Yell not only open eyed but open mouthed and having read in various English papers of the enthusiastic though somewhat puzzled welcome given to the jazz poet the American tramp poet both oddly undescrip tive phrases by poets and critics in London Cambridge and even old Oxford the editor felt that the poet s own story would interest us Instead of a story however Mr Lindsay sent a personal letter refusing to write the article on grounds so suggestive that the editor asked and finally obtained permission to print the following extracts  In Chicago as in London a certain public self is forced upon me by my friends the Vachel I was to them many years ago and I would as soon wear a plaster cast all over or mediaeval armor 1 suppose there is no living human being who more hates the formula of his yesterday even if it is forced upon him with the finest affection by his dearest friends I can be as ruthless with Springfield as with the opposition team in a football game But I do not want to kick the shins as it were of friends so good as those of the literary world who understand me at all   Notes and Queries from Mr Lindsay  That is not all I would give almost anything to escape forever the reciting and chanting Vachel Except when immediately under the intense excitement that comes with facing an extraordinarily concentrated group of listeners I dislike the very name of every poem I have recited except The Chinese Nightingale which after all I now recite very seldom My whole heart is set on escaping my old self completely as I may to be human and frail as we all are  The only thing that made the English trip possible for me was to consider it the rounding up and last phase of my reciting life I set January first 1921 as quitting time Everybody was very good too good to me in England but I went there aping or recording and as it were shouting the Vachel of ten years ago for one gets into rhyme only a self that is long dead I do not like that Vachel very well What then am I Certainly when you and I first met I had made my last water color designs my last decorative fantasies in gold and silver and silk You do not even know about them they are stuffed in great packages there behind the book case If I had been obliged to exhibit and explain them old and dusty as they are once a week till now I would feel about them as I do about reciting I do not want to be the slave of past performances or habits I cannot endure to be such a slave I care not what the apparent praise or reward I am a dead man in my own eyes and the only resurrection is in the new vista   The Golden Book of Springfield may be the poorest tiling I ever wrote but somewhere between the lines lies the hint of my new direction It is a sort of apple seed festering in my heart as I said in the Village Magazine  If I write about England I want to wait a year or so and see if it still looks important But I will say this that the English poets are splendid men and women and every one of them I met was hospitable and loyal to the last degree  Will Mr Lindsay s public let him grow out of his past  Does any public want anything of anybody but the expected  thing A poet s public is larger today than in Petrarch s  time Spenser s Pope s and more democratically minded  therefore it resents with a louder voice any effort at the  kind of growth which implies change Mr Lindsay is   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  like to find as many barriers to his escape from jazz as Mark Twain found between the professional humorist of a temporary mode and the great ironist of a larger scope which his admiring nineteenth century world never quite permitted him to be  Some of the English critics however see through the various disguises which Mr Lindsay has imaginatively assumed The Observer for example finds him the most traditional of American poets and rebukes his English publisher for omitting from the new book The Chinese Nightingale the finest and most splendid achievement in high poetry of the most remarkable American poet now writing  One fortunate effect of the trip has been a reminder to the self contained Englishman that poetry is essentially an oral art British readers are advised to intone it the Lindsay poetry aloud it is onomatopoeic and strange and barbaric but by no means just wordy Thus if Mr Lindsay carries out his threat to cease reciting he has already done a troubadour s work and may claim the right to discard that role along with his youth and his tramping outfit and pass on expectantly to fresh woods and pastures new Will he find new poems there Probably being a poet But in any case let us hope that he will find himself and freedom  The new direction in The Golden Book of Springfield seems to point toward the sublimated Utopian novel Springfield in this poet s imagining is an imperfectly shin   Notes and Queries from Mr Lindsay  ing city of God a froward city to be loved and chastised and redeemed And Springfield is but the type of many cities of these states each bright and dark each in need of a stern rhapsodic lover The Golden Book would point the way of redemption would light a torch to lead the way If both the way and the goal seem not closely enough visioned for apocalyptic clarity still the book never falters in high pride and passionate praise It is a protest against cheapness of soul in city or citizen from the man whom William Rose Ben√©t salutes as the most intensely individual and blazingly romantic poet of this generation Indeed Mr Ben√©t in the New York Evening Post traces kinship with Poe and John of Patmos himself  In another letter Mr Lindsay calls attention to a series of coincidences tending to strengthen his conviction of the inspirational vitality of the Middle West He writes  At the very hour when I was bringing out my Golden Book of Springfield the Macmillan Company was also issuing Edgar Lee Masters Mitch Miller and Domesday Book both in their fashion indicating Mr Masters as a veteran member of the Springfield Prognosticators Club At that very same hour the Publication Department of the Russell Sage Foundation was bringing out Shelby M Harrison s Social Conditions in an American City an intensive scientific study of Springfield Illinois based on ten careful reports by the survey staff At that very hour Harcourt Brace and Howe were publishing Sinclair Lewis Main Street a close up view of a middle western town which is having a phenomenal run And at that very same hour the presses of Alfred A Knopf were issuing Moon Calf by Floyd Dell a very dissimilar but highly praised study of a mid western town that might well be specifically Springfield And at that very same day and hour B W Huebsch   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  was sending forth Sherwood Anderson s Poor White another mid western study and prognosticative in its fashion  This extraordinary coincidence along with the necessary and striking contrast between these books and between their authors yet all tending to the same end is almost miraculously prefigured in Chapter III of The Golden Book of Springfield It is a coincidence that can scarcely be passed by without remark and that certainly should be studied It is far more rewarding than any data so far furnished from the mystical world by Patience Worth Sir Oliver Lodge or Conan Doyle  Without attempting to analyze this mystical significance one may agree that the Middle West is having its innings in much of the most honest the least tricky and commercial literary work of our immediate time Incidentally we may rejoice that applause in England has not swerved Mr Lindsay from Springfield and that POETRY so the Golden Book assures us is still for sale at Coe s Bookstore in the year 2020 A D  What is it like I wonder Number III of Volume CCXVII of POETRY H M  REVIEWS  OUR GREAT CARL SANDBURG  Smoke and Steel by Carl Sandburg Harcourt Brace and  Howe  Not long ago Chicago Poems two years ago Cornhuskers now Smoke and Steel Three solid thick healthy books of poetry This last has an up to date industrial look that reminds one befittingly of spikes and shingles and red painted skeletons of new skyscrapers   Our Great Carl Sandburg  Slang Shakespeare too had a gift for this wayward gab and in the times when play writing was an art in England it was used profusely and called roaring This of Carl Sandburg however is not exactly roaring it is a mixture of the best English there is with the language of workers and criminals and with Carl Sandburg s own swift metaphors A purely and originally American language it is and a language of today  Nature has entered this book Many things of this earth many things of that heaven of that sky that moon that sun are said in this book in beautiful words words that the sun colored the moon bleached the heavens sanctified the earth gave roots to as to marvelous trees Alley rats and workers throw a whim glittering slang over their dead and their sorrows here human tragedy is told with a whim and a smile or a snarl The whimsical word is a mystic question the whimsical word is the answer of the queer God of today in the little grin or the broad smile hides the way a human heart of today loves  The two poems of the first group Smoke and Steel and Work Gangs open up the chances for a coming Inferno Purgatorio and Paradiso of the new and the coming mechanical cities Now they are only a great promise  The People who Must the poet most mystically one of them  Broken face Gargoyles here the slang becomes a dizzy dance and a mad jazz The future cries out in a whirlwind of fun and terror the mystery laughs and weeps   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Mist Forms recalls to our minds two beautiful earlier  poems Pearl Fog and Last Answers  All the last answers go running back to dust and mist to dust and mist  Over the poet s resignation and renunciation songs arise changing scarfs of our fate changing scarfs of the whims of wind and sun question mark twists of mist and smoke Incidentally Chicago itself is the symbol the city of drab smoke and blue mists the city that dolls up and is a great lady with her morning blue mists around Lincoln Park the city that is an old busy sad hag dragging her rags of smoke around her drab new down town In the smoke and the dirt Carl Sandburg alone finds youth human tenderness and hope tomorrow in the blue mists the eternal yesterday and tomorrow blended together When we are reading him we believe him  Accomplished Facts is the humility of man doing big things the pride of man doing little things crowning both the peace of sleep and death matushka the good nurse  Passports in terms of rocks seas birds trees all written up in new colors new ancient colors flung again under the contemplating heavens by a man So many colors so many of them that we re dizzy Is this a rich man You tell em  Circles of Doors the ends opening into new ends always that is why in this decrepit young country we have so old so wise so very wise a poet Shall we itemize this great man Here goes   Everything asks and the silence of everything answers I know I am sad I have great pity in my heart for you Here in the song the secret the song keeps it the mystery grins it smiles it is a sad beautiful mother The mystery has a thousand beautiful faces each of which whispers a few words a poem The mystery s most beautiful child is Tomorrow  But Carl Sandburg s perfect book is yet to come There are faults and limitations to this fine work One limitation is the lack of lust and desire Rather the desire in it is so high that we humans cannot call it desire Evidently there is a price to be paid for serenity and I may point this out only because everything human seems to be in this book His chief fault is this Hats The Mayor of Gary Blue Maroons Manual Labor Vaudeville Dancer these are not poems they are simple statements compositions in which the power of suggestion depends on the mere words and not on the poetic spirit which should pervade them the poetic spirit is lacking Here and in some very short unsuccessful poems of the last two groups the poet instead of being wise sees if he can trick wisdom into a phrase or two if perchance before the eyes of the sensitive reader wisdom appears the poet should get no credit for it When the poem would be humorous it is instead foolish as in Soup  Another sign of the same defect is the unwarranted reiteration of such words as wishing answering asking I ask I know This shows the mystic becoming self conscious and losing his magic   But there is cosmic humor here  This was in the savvy of the Chaldeans And poems almost foolish sweet as the babble of mothers to children testify that the last word may be foolish and sweet foolish and childish that the last wisdom may be a child s  But we are not through complaining The Liars is not a good poem it s thin it s bad propaganda Not that propaganda shouldn t be but if it does not make for fine words it is either bad propaganda or it s insincere or it tries to propagate what it shouldn t There are other poems in the book that are good propaganda And another thing this book is one of broad hearted unrestrained generous sympathies so that we are sorry to find in it one or two poems in which there is rather the bad than the good spirit of slang an unsympathetic boisterousness High Conspiratorial Person Proud and Beautiful  And now we may go on praising Sandburg is tender and motherly All sad things are sweetened for him by his great tenderness his great pity The way smoke comes over the world is as tender and mysterious as the way sleep comes over a man Sometimes slang lags and becomes a plain coarse English humbler and sweeter the fierceness and vigor of slang lag and the world is then a mystery for tired eyes half open half wishing half sleeping Sometimes the tenderness is so very high so very pure that it is not tenderness any more but only height like heaven where God is very cold like peaks very distant from us from petty human   Our Great Carl Sandburg  loves and hatreds like the love and hatred of God high as the look in Sandburg s eyes cold as granite too as the look of his grey eyes And there is mystery carried along by things like their shadows and sometimes in the shadows are roses sometimes the green of the seas sometimes dust sometimes sleep sometimes smoke sometimes steel looming And always a thought of the end recurring like an old clock striking the hour There are poems where the tenderness snarls as the tenderness of a lioness defending her cubs There are poems like White Ash that have burnt to a white ash in the heart of the poet There are old style majestic poems with the lines running about the same length and a poem about insanity testifying that the secret of insanity concerns love and song more than scientific research In all of them there is a great stern lesson a lesson of health and strength the lesson of two cold granite eyes  Carl Sandburg grinning giving only half answer is Carl the Swede Tender and sweet motherly Carl Sandburg vast Carl Sandburg is Carl the American And one may call him American only if one knows such solid American types as the workers and criminals he sings the language of the forgotten submerged world where the oldest essences of life are preserved and continually renovated in contrast with the world swaggering puritanism and business which one knows too well He is the poet of America s good qualities he bears witness to God that America is after all a living country And if we exclude Walt Whitman he is in the words and metaphors the wealthiest   writer America ever read I lay a bet and take all the  chances that no novel or book of any kind published in  the whole world within the last ten years contains as many  different words as this relatively short book of his  Quotations Let s give the book a royal chance let s  open it at random  And then Loosen your hands let go and say goodby Let the stars and songs go Let the faces and years go Loosen your hands and say goodby  Listen awhile the lake by night is a lonely woman a lovely woman circled with birches and pines mixing their green and white among stars shattered in spray clear nights  The sea mist green of the bowl s bottom is a dark throat of sky crossed by quarreling forks of umber and ochre and yellow changing faces  Only slam me across the ears something and hunt for a white  star In my forehead and twist the bang of my forelock around it Make a wish for me Maybe I will light out like a streak of  wind   Enfin it s poetry Long live Carl Sandburg to sing the  song of his own beauty and to tell God about Chicago  America the world Emanuel Carnevali  A SINGER  Flame and Shadow by Sara Teasdale Macmillan Co  The quality of immortality is a curious thing as unanalys  able as a scent caught on the wind or a tint in the dawn   sky as unanalysable and as definite The printer s ink lavished on poetry today flows like a mountain torrent The poems interest they stimulate they comfort they intrigue they wake the gamut of emotion and they seem to satisfy Till suddenly a poem comes with this curious quality of immortality and there is a sensation deep in one s subconscious self as though a clamor of voices had ceased suddenly and a little bell had rung somewhere in a deep silence  Sara Teasdale has achieved this quality perhaps half a dozen times in her short life Whatever else may be uncertain in the poetic upheaval of today we can at least be certain of this  The detractors of her work say that it is monotonous that it is all in the same key and in a sense they speak truly Her lyrics and in this latest book she seems to have abandoned the only half successful attempts of some of her earlier books to write more sustained poems are always intensely personal always in a minor key whether they express sadness or joy always wistful and full of yearning A book of them at a single sitting is certainly too large a dose  Yet though this is true as a critical judgment this dictum has no validity since art must always be judged by what it has not by what it lacks And this monotony is typical of all the pure lyricists Herrick has it Pierre de Ronsard Walter von der Vogelweide Verlaine Heine A E Housman go through the list as you will you will find it every   where But who quarrels with Herrick because he did not also write Paradise Lost or with Walter von der Vogelweide that his name is not found on Faust And who in the years to come will quarrel with Sara Teasdale that she did not write Spoon River It is enough in this world of half things to have done one thing perfectly  In no other field of poetry is there so wide a divergence of personal preference as in this field of lyrics So immediate and so intensely personal is a lyric that the response to it depends on the reader s own knowledge of the emotion described The greatest lyrics are those which combine magic of music with the most universal subject What many of our present day poets fail to realize is that not even magic of utterance will make a great poem on a subject which is itself a bizarrerie and which can therefore find no emotional response in the normal reader  The divergence of preference in the field of lyrics was pointedly shown some years ago in the deliberation of a jury on which I served which was to award three prizes for poems One prize was for the most notable piece of work among those eligible one was an encouragement prize and one was for a pure lyric The first two were awarded without much difficulty but when it came to the lyric prize out of six jurors there were six determined opinions and only great forbearance made any compromise possible  What existed there exists always Indeed I am of the opinion that among the best lyrics of any lyricist it is not so much the intrinsic value of any given poem as the im  ponderable personal preference of the anthologist which decides which shall be immortalized Who knows what particular bent of the unknown compiler of the Chinese Book of Odes gave us the lyrics we know rather than others equally well written Criticism by the mind goes only a certain distance in judging a lyric After that the heart speaks and there is no forecasting its ways  Yet Sara Teasdale need fear nothing from this diversity of preference since no anthologist has failed or will fail to find half a dozen poems completely to his liking among the many which she has wrung from a frail body and a shimmering spirit  This latest volume Flame and Shadow is in no great way different from her other volumes though having been written during two years of loneliness and pain the poems are a little more sombre than some of the earlier ones Magic is here as always Let each choose for himself  For myself if I were the ultimate anthologist I should add to her established quota of perfect lyrics two from this volume one called Let it be Forgotten which was printed in POETRY and this one On the Dunes  If there is any life when death is over These tawny beaches will know much of me I shall come back as constant and as changeful As the unchanging many colored sea If life was small if it has made me scornful Forgive me I shall straighten like a flame In the great calm of death and if you want me Stand on the seaward dunes and call my name  E T   A SCORE OF FIRST BOOKS  Candles That Burn by Aline Klimer Geo H Doran Co The

Wisconsin  In spite of the prohibitive cost of paper and print in spite of the still reputed unsalability of poetry never in this magazine s history were we so swamped with new books in our specialty never did so many young poets get their first offerings between covers To review adequately even the best of these books is absolutely impossible so long as the magazine is limited to its present size W e are compelled to group them in this fashion if we would give our readers even a hint of the quality of these young aspirants  The astonishing thing perhaps is that so many of these first books are good or at least promising The twenty or more listed above represent only a fraction of those we have received most of the others being consigned to a limbo of charitable silence More than half of the above list perhaps the best of them may be classed as meditative and confessional with love as the favorite sometimes the only subject These poets seem sincere each one seems to say his own word and not another s to give us a genuine expression of genuine emotion and most of them have read modern poetry to some purpose for their style is simple and direct not over appareled even when they use the most conventional forms  One may fitly begin with Mrs Kilmer s spaciously printed book of fifty lyrics the spirit in it is so gallant and the best of the poems are so fine an expression of the simplest most poignant emotion The poems which refer   to her dead husband and dead child especially I shall not be Afraid and To Rose wring one s heart by saying the unexpected thing the little true thing which seems not to have been said before and they say it with perfect spontaneity and without a single merely ornamental word to vary their quiet color The happier poems while more conventional are never artificial and in certain more or less whimsical ones the poet s children are vividly and individually alive We cannot pass on without quoting I shall not be Afraid  I shall not be afraid any more Either by night or day What would it profit me to be afraid With you away  Now I am brave In the dark night alone All through the house I go Locking the doors and making windows fast When sharp winds blow  For there is only sorrow in my heart There is no room for fear But how I wish I were afraid again My dear my dear  The Hesitant Heart by Winifred Welles also expresses personal emotion in the simplest terms but it records as the title indicates a less poignant experience of life I have no beauty that is all my own the poet sings and the few love poems have the tenuosity of a dream indeed dreams are here less tenuous than experience The groping wistfulness of a shy creature sensitive to beauty is revealed as with a delicate hand drawing away chiffon veils   A Score of First Books  I ve lived so long companionless In this old house bowed down with years I ve learned to welcome loneliness Converse with dreams and sit with fears  Elise Cabot who writes of and probably from Arizona is a freer spirit born under bluer skies I awake my love fills the world she cries and There is in life but one investment spending  I throw my heart away As a bird who sings all day Giving her song away I cheer the passers by And lonely souls who die All shrivelled and unfed Just so my heart I spread  The book has vital energy stirred by the keen winds of beauty But the freedom of spirit should be matched with a freer technique and more modern diction Both the prose poems and those in rhyme are haunted by ghosts thou and thee doth deem knoweth and formeth etc would drag us away from our own time far away from Arizona The love poems especially are seriously marred their sincerity threatened by this defect  George O Neil is more fortunate in exact metrics than in freer forms In fact some of his love songs and nature poems usually done in quatrains or sonnets such lyrics as A Little Song An Old Chapel Yard Margot Portent and Song of Love s Ending almost justify the praise of Professor Lowes on the cover and Zo√´ Akins in her preface for they have emotional fervor and a certain shapeliness and   beauty of tone W e should like to quote Portent with its poignant close here is the Song of Love s Ending all but the first quatrain which is marred by a weak line  Summer is slowly fading failing Golden green of her beauty fled Time has sighed the rose is paling Some of its glory dead  O falling leaves and summer spent What I would change I do not know Death is not sorrow since Love went But if my dreams should go  W J Turner who has been in the recent Georgian anthologies is not only haunted by echoes he goes in search of the rare the erudite  I am a hunter after wayward words That I may press them into service meet For their rare beauty  And he tries experiments with word and sound repetitions Sea Madness for example is an over studied chiming of soft sounds The emotion gets smothered in its too conscious utterance it is sucked pale by the poet s hunger for the sweets of beauty sweets that become insipid with over indulgence  The orange glooms in the half dawn The white walls are pale glimmering dreams Trees haunt them stream still dim illumed With round gold fruits on green boughs borne  Mr Turner gives us too much of this kind of thing his strange places are poetized away into thin air He has a delicate touch undoubtedly but we look in vain for that frightful strength which the Athenaeum accords him   A Score of First Books  In George Rostrevor s Escape and Fantasy one may find now and then a beautiful thing The Voice is a sincerely ecstatic love poem of almost disembodied passion too long to quote unfortunately but this brief Elysium is in the same mood  Hushed their feet fall On the dewy grass In robe rhythmical Shining they pass Lovers who for bliss Grave and rare and deep Need no clasp or kiss Or lovers sleep Quests Poems in Prose is a young poet s essay in biblical rhythms done with a fitful and inconsistent use of biblical diction However in these five Quests Of Day and Night of Nature of Love and The Eternal Quest a strong spirit is revealed in close intercourse with the sources of life Many of these low toned utterances say nothing new but they are not mere platitudes because of personal grace touches of loveliness And the poet has a high pride  I open doors before you You may pass through or turn away as you will  There are doors which I will open that shall never close You will see the open doors and before you are aware you will have passed through  Charles Reznikoff s brief free verse poems are sometimes as incisive as a hokku for example  We heard no step in the hall She came Sudden as a rainbow   And here is one in rhyme  The troopers are riding are riding by The troopers are riding to kill and die That a clean flag may cleanly fly  They touch the dust in their homes no more They are clean of the dirt of shop and store And they ride out clean to war  Margaret Napier s Songs of the Dead would be more highly individual as Edward Garnett calls the book in his preface if Spoon River had never been written Also the free verse in which these grave meditations appear is of a crudity But the love story emotionally unfolded by the lady lying underground is touching and in one brief poem the best in the book we have it with telegraphic brevity  O God out of the pit do you hear My cry I was cold I was cruel I was faithless I am sorry I am sorry I am sorry  The term free verse seems to cover a multitude of sins in the minds of many young poets and their publishers Of course it has passed far away from the original meaning of vers libre which meant in French prosody rhymed verse in lines of unequal length and we have a right perhaps to use even the French term loosely Modern free verse is cadence verse as distinguished from verse in exact metrics But it is not as the late Mr Howells wittily called some of its alleged manifestations shredded prose Miss Napier and the three ladies next to be no   A Score of First Books  ticed apparently have not arrived at the remotest suspicion of the presence of poetic rhythms in cadence verse rhythms which are it is hardly necessary to say as subtle as the most richly cadenced iambics One demands something more than the patter patter of a rabbit from even the youngest vers libertine  Agnes Ryan is simple and sincere but when the late William Marion Reedy found her as poignant sometimes as Fiona McLeod he must have been stressing her emotional motive rather than her technical accomplishment In rhyme she is less crude than in the freer forms but one looks in vain for adequate expression of her wistful mood  Indeed young poets suffer rather than gain from overpraise Helen Dircks poems also have as her husband Frank Swinnerton says in the preface the quality of a beautiful candor the candor of youth and innocence But as yet she has so little to say that the poems are extremely slight The rhymed ones are promising belike but she might well have waited for more mature experience  Mercedes de Acosta s brief meditations on Memory Faith Love Joy etc are printed in broken lines but that is the only indication they offer of any attempt at poetic rhythm There is genuine feeling in these little human vignettes a situation is often vividly and picturesquely presented but why confuse the issue by a verse disguise  The other books in the above long list are in a lighter vein written with serious intention perhaps but touching off life or its episodes more casually Most of these poets   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  would be suspect in Russia just now for they express the reactions of us comfortable bourgeois a point of view amusingly presented in Hortense Flexner s Inheritance  Prometheus pitying men Dared the long wrath of gods Thongs and the vulture To bring to earth The fire Before which I drowse In utter well being  Miss Flexner s other reactions have often charm and occasionally a stinging shaft of wit Her Old Lady of the Sonnets for example is delicious  Samuel McCoy would interpret life in terms of old romance like the Ben√©t brothers Titles like The Argonauts Voyageurs Song The Old Tavern carry his symbols even Thompson Street is gilded by this color This poet s temptation is toward a loose and expansive style but The Mother The Bondwoman and some of the war poems are closer and more stern  Daniel Henderson also is life s minstrel he dreams lightly in a mood of romance a pleasant and facile rhymester He scarcely escapes that limitation even in the war poems of which Alan Seeger is one of the best This quatrain is its finale  He kept his rendezvous in that dark place His life became a ransom for his race Hark now His song is on the nation s breath His memory shall have no tryst with death  Paul Eldridge whose thoughts are little clowns silver flutes shaven monks and other prettily symbolic   A Score of First Books  things is rather empirical in his use of free verse But his Vanitas presents with grace a pleasant sometimes whimsical drawing room acquaintance He sums it up thus  I played with God And now I understand His dice are always loaded  James L McLane Jr who follows the safe levels of iambics and rhyme has also a light touch upon passing emotion Spindrift though his second book is still rather sophomoric indulging in deems ere now s and numerous clich√©s and delighting too youthfully in prettiness But there is some promise in it  John Bunker s book has the bad luck to be over emphasized on its cover A modern of moderns its author is called a mind attent upon the last patient step of a progress real and unafraid etc W e are led to expect clear singing serene hopeful and melodious  After all this what do we find The And oh but it was gay kind of thing the careful avoidance of any trace of originality in short the persistent commonplace Here is the way this modern of moderns begins a long poem to Francis Thompson  Mayhap I seek thee All the forespent years Haply I traversed waiting thy lone voice  The Yale Series of Younger Poets is a good intention on the part of the Yale University Press imperfectly evidenced thus far by four small pamphlets Of these the first by Howard Buck we have already said a good word for and   the second by John Farrar has not reached us The other two poets Mr Bellinger and Mr Hamilton seem to have been like Mr Buck in the A E F but their reactions to war and other subjects are much more mild Mr Bellinger likes ballades and rondeaux Mr Hamilton prefers sonnets otherwise one could hardly tell them apart These boys may be poets some day but they and their editors should have done some harder thinking before offering their freshman verse to the cold public  One opens Mr Macartney s Poems with the hope of getting something different from Australia But the sonnets rondels and other rhymes are conventional and the poet s experiences are like those of everyone else It is conversational verse a few office sketches being the best  As a close for this rambling article one may be permitted a tardy word about Mr Jameson s book which through an accident has been waiting three years for the recognition it should have had at once For here is a college boy of real promise singing his own round songs of girls professors concerts love truth and all the rest of it We may hear from Mr Jameson some day meantime The Song of Death is something to remember Here are the first two stanzas  Death to the young man fighting in the trenches  Is but a fever of the proud young flesh  It will come quickly like discovered beauty  Taking the soul of him while its strength is fresh  Taking the soul of him  Dancing it away from him  Proudly commending him  While his strength is fresh   Death to an old man living in his memories  Is like an enemy familiar and yet feared  Grasping at his white hairs it will break the back of him  It will drink the soul of him and fumble round his beard  It will drink the soul of him  Like a draught of whiskey  Taking his memories  From his old white beard  These first books winging in from all points of the  compass present a good deal of talent of promise But the  keenest critic can not tell which of the young poets they in  troduce will persist to even approximate fulfilment  H M CORRESPONDENCE  A WORD OF PROTEST  Editors of POETRY May I venture to comment through the medium of your correspondence section on Miss Monroe s review of the Others Anthology for 1919  I cannot think that Miss Monroe would wish to have one sentence in particular stand unchallenged POETRY having published all but four of the twenty six poets represented before ever they became others  In the first six months of 1919 Others the magazine brought out Evelyn Scott and Haniel Long and printed Lola Ridge and Emanuel Carnevali who up to that time had not appeared in POETRY Altogether I would estimate that POETRY published all but seventeen   I am inclined to think that Miss Monroe intended instead of published to say received manuscripts from It is not improbable that all of the twenty six poets in the anthology submitted manuscripts to POETRY in their proudspirited youth  It would seem that Miss Monroe would be rather apologetic than arrogant toward Others a magazine with no endowment whatever which has yet managed to publish first  T S Eliot s Portrait of a Lady Rhapsody on a Windy Night Preludes and Wallace Stevens Peter Quince at the Clavier There are many others most of which may be found in Miss Monroe s anthology The New Poetry  I had hoped for a more dignified review than this It seems a bit gratuitous for the editor of a magazine of the standing of POETRY to institute invidious comparisons between POETRY and another magazine which has apparently gone under  Let Miss Monroe remember that there is still proudspirited youth in this country and such ungenerous guerrilla politics as this will not help to reconcile it to the shortcomings of her magazine John W Crawford  Note by the Editor Mr Crawford is mistaken in certain of his details for five of the six poets he mentions were published in POETRY from one to five years before 1919 In the case of Evelyn Scott the editor was mistaken  But all that as he insists is not important What is important and much to be regretted is that the review of the Others anthology in our December number should have seemed arrogant indeed ungenerous guerilla politics when no irritation was felt or intended Indeed this eight page article unusually long and de   tailed considering our space was supposed to be extremely complimentary  In September 1915 POETRY offered the glad hand of welcome to the new born Others saying It is the little magazines which should be encouraged and subscribed for The great magazines are mostly engaged in the same game that of getting a million readers But each little magazine represents someone s enthusiasm for a cause or an art It represents self sacrifice courage some vital principle From that time until now POETRY has frequently complimented Others as the most vital and interesting of its contemporaries We have deeply regretted that no enlightened New Yorker offered to serve the art by financing the magazine and that therefore its career was lamentably brief An open forum for radical experiment is almost a necessity to the healthful progress of any art One organ whether perfect or imperfect is not enough there should be Others NOTES  Mr Max Michelsen formerly of Chicago but now a resident of Seattle has
