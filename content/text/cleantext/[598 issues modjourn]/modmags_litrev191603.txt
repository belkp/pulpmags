expensetroublemore of a responsibilityneverthelessallowing for all thisstill is curiousthat difference in valueisn t it Art and Anarchism MARGARET CANDERSON WHENtheyask you what anarchism isand you scuffle around for the most convincing definitionwhy don t you merely ask instead What is art Because anarchism and art are in the world for exactly the same kind of reasonAn anarchist is a person who realizes the gulf that lies between government and lifean artist is a person who realizes the gulf that lies between life and loveThe former knows that he can never get from the government what he really needs for lifethe latter knows that he can never get from life the love he really dreams ofNow there is only one class of people among the very rich or the very poor or the very middling that doesn t know about these thingsIt is the uneducated classIt is composed of housewivesbusiness menchurch goersfamily egoistsclub womenpoliticiansdetectivesdebutantesdrummersChristian Scientistspolicemendemagoguessocial climbersministers who recommend plays like Experienceetc etcIt even includes some who may be educated journalistsprofessorsphilanthropistspatriots artisticpeoplesentimentalistscowardsand the insaneIt is the great middle class mind of AmericaIt is the kind of mind that either doesn t think at all or that thinks like this Without the violence and the plotting there would be nothing left of anarchism but a dead theoryWithout the romance of it anarchism would be nothing but a theory which will not work and never can until nature has evolved something very different out of manIt is cops and robbershare and houndsIvanhoe and EPhillips Oppenheim all acted out in lifeIt is not really dangerous to societybut only to some members of itbecause unless every one is against it there is no fun in it There is no fun talking about anarchism to people who understand itBut it would be great fun to make the middle class mind understand itThis is the way I should go about it What things do you need in order to liveFoodclothingshelterWhat things must you have to get life out of the process of livingLoveworkrecreationAll rightDoes the government give you the first three thingsNot at allIt isn t the government or law or anything of that sort that gives you food or clothesIt s the efficient organization between those who produce these things and those who sell them to youAnd it isn t government that keeps that organization efficientIt s the brains of those who work in itYou will say that government exists to prevent that organization from charging you too much for food and clothesThen why doesn t government do itHeaven knows you ve got all the government you can very well use and you pay too much for everythingDoes the government give you a houseIf you happen to be an ambassador or something like thatNot if you happen to be a mail manMaybe some one leaves you a house which means that he once bought it or stole it or had it left to himYou can do any of these three things yourselfOr you can go withoutas nearly every one else doesSometimes the government helps you to steal one but not you of the middle classWhat I want to know is why you are so crazy about the governmentNowabout workWhat do you call workspending eight hours a day in an office to help make somebody s business a successand incidentally to earn the money for your bread and butterBut that s a third of the time you re given on earthAnother third has to be spent in sleepand the last third in eating your dinner spending the evening getting undressedgetting dressedeating your breakfastand catching your trainI call that slaveryWork is something over which you can toil twenty four hours a day if you feel like itbecause if you don t your life will have no meaningIt s like artWhat has the government to do with your workAbout as much as it had to do with Marconi s brain when he was conceiving his wirelessWhat do you call recreationlounging in hotel lobbiesgossiping over tea tablesgoing to the movies All rightBut what has the government got to do with itOr do you call it walkingridingreadinglying in the sunThe government doesn t give you good legs or a motor car or books or a stretch of beach to lie onBut it can keep some of the best books away from you and close up the bathing beaches on the hottest October dayMaybe you call recreation what it really meansre creationThat means the time and the leisure to invite your soulYou ve got governmenthave you got either time or leisureAnd as for loveYou love some one who loves youand the world is goodOr you love some one who doesn t love you and the world is hellOr you love and love and can find no one to loveOr you love and cannot giveor love and cannot takeor maybe you cannot love at allAnd where is the government all this timeThe government can bring you a letter from some one you loveBut why must even that be done with graftSome one assaults a woman in a dark alleyyou sayand where would we be without the governmentWhat has that to do with lovefirstNow clear up your minds have you ever imagined why these things happenBecause some people are viciousyou sayBut every one is vicious every one who has life in himYou are only you can take it out on your wife or on whatever prostitutes you can affordor in eating large dinnersor in joy ridesin vulgar partiesin the moviesin luxuryin fadsin arteven in religionIt just depends upon your typeThe point is that you have your outlets and the other wretch hasn tAnd secondsince these things are always happening and you have plenty of chances to see how the government deals with themthe only sensible question left for you to ask isWhy aren t they dealt withYou ve got government and you ve got crime on the increaseMay it be that you will ever see this that the thing needs treat mentnot govern mentBut if you re talking about love In love you will act just like a cave man or an Athenian or an early Christian or an Elizabethan or a modernlike a satyr or a traveling salesman or an artist it depends upon your typeGovernments may come and gomay change or cease to beand nothing remains forever exceptyour type But it s just here that your government has its functionsIt can do various thingsAnd since the value of your life depends upon the intensity with which you love something or somebodyyou might as well recognize what your government can do for you in this regard If you think that love and freedom ought to go together the government can put you in prisonIf you marry out of respect for the governmentand grow to hate each otherthe government won t give you a divorce out of respect for youIf you marry as a concession to the governmentbecause you don t want to ruin your business or have your wife insultedthe government will divorce you and on the concession basisbut you pay for both the concessionsIf you believe that love is lovewhether it brings you children or notyou may be happy and prosperousbut you will not be safeThe government can put your physician in prisonIf you re very poor or very illand ought not have childrenthe government can keep information for prevention away from you and it can put any one who tries to give you that information in prisonIf you should die from an abortion and you surely will die if you contract blood poisoningand you surely will do that if you must be treated in secrecy and without skill the government can hang your physicianWhy are you so crazy about the governmentWhy do you want to govern anything or anybodyeven your own temperNietzsche said not to preserve yourself but to discharge yourselfWhy not use your temper as well as your nice moodsWhy do you want to govern your childTo give him characterBut who ever told you that life is for the making of characterEven if it wereyou can t give your child characterHe can get it by going through a great dealBut if you govern him successfully he won t go through a great dealHe will just be something that is like something elseHe won t be himselfWhy do you want to govern human natureBecause you want people to be good instead of badBut how can you tell when they re good and when they re badSuppose you all agree that Jean Crones did a very bad thingIf you knew Jean Crones you should probably all see at once that he is a very good man if he exists at allClear up your thinkingWho ever told you that an anarchist wants to change human natureWho ever told you that an anarchist s ideal could never be attained until human nature had improvedHuman nature will neverimprove It doesn t matter much whether you have a good nature or a bad oneIt s your thinking that countsClean out your mindsIf you believe these things nothat is not enoughif you live themyou are an anarchistYou can be one right nowYou needn t wait for a change in human naturefor the milleniumor for the permission of your familyJust be oneYou have seen thatthe blindheavystupid thing we call governmentcan not give you a happy childhoodIt cannot educate you or make you an interesting personIt cannot give you workartloveor life or death if you think it is better to dieAnd finally when you see that you can never get all the love you imagined from lifethat you are trappedreallyand must find a way outwhen you see that here where there is nothing is the way outand that the wonder of life begins here when you see all this you will be an artistand your love that isleft overwill find its music or its wordsStravinky s Three Pieces Grotseques String Quartets AMY LOWELL First Movement Thin

a slight heavinessbut his eyes were quietIn his young manhood he had been involved in a scandal that had made him a marked man in the communityHe had deserted his wife and children and had run away with a seriousdark skinned young girlthe daughter of a Methodist ministerAfter a few years he had come back into the community and had opened a law officeThe social ostracism set up against him and his wife had in reality turned out to their advantageHe had worked fiercely and the dark skinned girl had worked fiercelyAt forty five he had risen to wealth and to a commanding position before the bar of his stateand his wifenow a surgeonhad a fast growing reputation for abilityIt was night and he sat in a room with the dead body of his younger brotherwho had gone the road he had traveled in his twentiesThe brothera huge good natured fellowhad been caught and shot in the home of a married womanIn the room with the lawyer sat a womanShe was a nursein charge of the children of his second wifea magnificent blonde creature with white teethThey sat beside a tablespread with book and magazinesThe woman who sat with the lawyer in the room with the dead manwaslike himselfflush with lifeHe rememberedwith a startthat she had been introduced into the house by the boy who was deadHe began to couple them in his mind and talked about it You were in love with himeh he asked presentlyThe woman said nothingShe sat under a lamp with her legs crossedThe lamplight fell upon her shapely shouldersThe lawyergetting out of his chairwalked up and down the roomHe thought of his wifethe woman he lovedasleep upstairsand of the price they had paid for their devotion to each other It is barbarousthis old custom of sitting up with the dead he saidandgoing to another part of the housereturned with a bottle of wine and two glassesWith the wine before them the lawyer and the woman sat looking at each otherThey stared boldly into each other s eyeseach concerned with his own thoughtsA clock ticked loudly and the woman moved uneasilyBy an open window the wind stirred a white curtain and tossed it back and forth above the coffinblack and ominousHe began thinking of the years of hardunremittent labor and of the pleasures he had missedBefore his eyes danced visions of white clad dinner tableswith men and bare shouldered women sitting aboutAgain he walked up and down the roomUpon the table lay a magazinedevoted to farm lifeand upon the cover was a scene in a barn yardA groom was leading a magnificent stallion out at the door of a red barnPointing his finger at the picturethe lawyer began to talkA new quality came into his voiceHis hand played nervously up and down the tableThere was a gentle swishing sound of the blown curtain across the top of the coffin I saw one once when I was a boy he saidpointing with his finger at the stallionHe approached and stood over her It was a wonderful sight he saidlooking down at her I have never forgotten itThe great animal was all lifevibrantmagnificent lifeIts feet scarcely touched the groundWe are like that he addedleaning over her The men of our family have that vibrantconquering life in us The woman arose from the chair and moved toward the darkened corner where the coffin stoodHe followed slowlyWhen they had gone thus across the room she put up her hand and plead with him NonoThinkRemember she whisperedWith a low laugh he sprang at herShe dodged quicklyBoth of them had become silentAmong the chairs and tables they wentswiftlysilentlythe pursuer and the pursuedInto a corner of the room she gotwhere she could no longer elude himNear her sat the long coffinits ends resting on black stands made for the purposeThey struggledand then as they stood breathless with hot startled facesthere was a crashthe sound of broken glass and the dead body of his brother with its staring eyes rolledfrom the fallen coffinout upon the floor The Little Review Don ts for CriticsApropos of recent criticisms of Imagismvers

THINGTHE LITTLE REVIEW is a magazine of Art and RevolutionIf you ask me which it believes in most I shall have to sayArtBecause there is no real revolution unless it is born of the same spirit which produces real artA man like Bill Haywood doesn t agree with this Why do you ask why some one doesn t start the revolution he says don t you see that we re in the midst of a revolution now NoI don t see itI see evolution at work in labor not revolutionBut I see something more than evolution at work in the artsmusicpaintingpoetryto obtain victory over man and circumstance there is no other way but that of feeding one s own exaltation and magnifying one s own dream of beauty or of power You can argue that D Annunziowho said thisis neither a very great man nor a very great artistNevertheless it is what Beethoven did and it is what Jeanne d Arc didIt is what Bill Haywood doesbut it is not what most labor leaders door what most radicals doIt is not what the laborers themselves doHow horrible it is to realize that when a man is slaving for his very life he can not be selective in what he doesthat he has no dream left to magnifyand yet that he must have or perishThis is why I would go to hear John Cowper Powys even if he spoke in such a benighted place as the Hebrew InstituteBoycotts are importantbut they will not help a revolution as a dream willMrPowys will help you to find both an exaltation and a dream DONT S FOR CRITICSI WENT to a meeting of the Friday Club the other daywhere Mary Aldis was to read a very good paper which she calledA Passionate Inquiry into Imagism After she had finishedHarriet Monroe rose to defend the poetry of HDpoetry which MrsAldis had confessed left her unmovedMiss Monroeexplainedthe miracle of such poetry as HD s Oread so that even those who don tgetthese things ought to have understoodAnd stillwhat is the use I am convinced that the secret and the beauty of the Imagists lies somehow in the look of the wordsand that if you have only a feeling for the sounds of words you will never love ImagismWitter Bynnerwho was also theremade an amusing little speech about how the Imagists substitute color for soundsensation for emotionand concentrate upon technique instead of upon that for which technique is intendedAnd then Alice Corbin Henderson had the last word After all the discussion about Imagism I am surprised to find that no one really seems to know what it is When MrsAldis told me the title of her paper I said that what I should like would be a dispassionate inquiryShe said she didn t think that possible apparently it isn tbut as I was thinking over the many heated criticisms of Imagism and modern poetry that have appeared latelyI began to make a list of Don ts for the criticsThey are printed on another pageOf courseif the critics can t find out what Imagism is there isn t any need telling them though it might be well to point out again that it isn t a matter of technique it is a matter of vision A TRIBUTEJEANNE D ORGEwho makes her first appearance in print in the present issuehas the semblance of a fountain laced with colored flamesBut you dip a hand in the laced water and it is chilled and edgedThere is a defiantbattered God with many swords beneath her casual flow of words a God that sometimes suddenly cries outas at the end of her Sealed PackageThe poems she has in the present number are part of a series called The Torchin which with sledge hammerburning accurateness she paints the emotions of a womanfrom childhood to womanhood a woman who is an utter wistful lipped paganMBPropaganda BIRTH CONTROL MARGARET SANGER S case has been dismissed because she is not a disorderly personand what has been gained for the issue of birth controlNothingexcept perhaps a little education through publicity and that appears to be very little when you reflect what has just happened to young DrLongnow lying in jail in Chicago because of an abortion which resulted in the death of his wifeThink of a society that dares to meddle in people s lives to the extent of making them face death rather than face a scandalThink of a doctorthe cad by the name of GoldstineI believewho notifies the police as the proper agents to deal with such a tragedyThink of a public which makes it a crime for these operations to be performed intelligently and without danger of blood poisoningThink of physicians who will not fight for their right to do thisAnd think of splendid DrHaiselden Margaret Sanger has beenforgivenby the governmentbut the statutes regarding family limitation remain the sameAny unfortunate unknown can be whisked into jail for propagating birth controljust as usualMrsSanger didn t even demand redress for her husbandwho spent a month in prisonSurely he was entitled to a dismissal on the same grounds more entitled to iteven in the eyes of the law he had never circulated the pamphlets or in any way agitated for birth controlHe is an artistnot a propagandistBut he served his sentenceand nothing was done or is being done about itMrsSanger means to go on with her workWhat does the government mean to do about itEmma Goldman is about to stand trial for the sameoffense In her case there will be noinfluentialwomen rushing back and forth to Washington to interview the President in her behalfI only wish there would beIt would insure her freedom for the next yearand it would be so amusing to figure out on what grounds the Good Presbyterian could effect the release of the Arch AnarchistBut Emma Goldman will fight her case aloneand on its meritsIf she does not succeed in effecting a revision of the penal code regarding the whole matter of birth control she will spend the next year in prisonI understandYou can all help by sending your protests to Magistrate Simms and also by giving your support to DrLong and DrHaiselden or any other person who gets involved in these laws of the dark ages THE BEAUTIFUL GESTUREWHY do you object to Jean CronesreasoningI reprint his second lettertransposed into English Why did I do itWhile in Europe millions of Christians are slaughtering each other in the most bloody massacreand in this free country thousands of men and women are tramping the streets without food and shelterand at the same time the church holds dinners that cost15 a coverbeginning with Beluga caviar and champagnethe money which was beggared from poor working men and womenthe money which the blood of poor workers has run forThese conditions are a scandalThis is the failure of Christianity an insult to honesty and a challenge to humanityLet the church answer my charges toward the world and I shall stand for the charges made against meMOTOR BUSSES ON CHICAGO BOULEVARDSTHERE is really a definite plan on foot for this miracleA Motor Bus Company has been formedand the necessary certificates from the State Public Utilities Commission securedIts plan is to operate from the south end of Jackson Park to the north end of the city limitsPeople who haven t limousineswho can t afford taxisand who can t possibly walk the whole distance of the parkswill be able to drive through the beautiful parts of the city the only beautiful partsit is necessary to addFor ten cents they can have an astounding romanceThey can sit on top of an omnibusunder the sun or the starsand watch Lake Michigan stretching out to the other side of the worldThat isthey can do this if the Park Commissioners decide to allow themSome of these commissioners raise the objection that motor busses will add seriously to the traffic congestionThat is truebut how is the thing managed in New YorkFifth Avenue is narrower than Michiganand it is always more crowdedOther commissioners object to the wear and tear on the boulevards which have not been constructed for such heavy trafficBut the Chicago Motor Bus Companyhas agreed to pay the Lincoln Park Commissioners1 300 a year for each mile of their route and the South Park Commissioners1 000 a year per mile The thing that really halts the plan at present is the attitude of a couple of private citizens who complain to the South Park Board that motor busses will destroy the beauty of the boulevards You know the type of mind whose thinking runs in such channelsThe type that doesn t give a hang who pays the taxes which maintain the boulevards the type that is fond of talking about democracy and what great things we do for the foreigner in AmericaOf the men who rhymeso large a number are cursed with suburban comfortsA villa and books never made a poet they do but tend to the building up of the respectable virtues and for the respectable virtues poetry has but the slightest useTo roam in the sun and air with vagabondsto haunt the strange corners of citiesto know all the useless and improperand amusing people who are alone very much worth knowing to liveas well as to observe lifeorto be shut up in hospitaldrawn out of the rapid current of life into a sordid and exasperating inactionto waitfor a timein the

grey beestunned by the stormto my sleeveLollipop Venders LUPO DE BRAILA MISFIT clothingI saw these words this morning on a small shop sign and they kept dancing before my eyesMisfit clothingIn vain all my attempts to concentrate on the object of my visit to the Art InstituteI sat down to search my brain for the cause of this phenomenonand I soon recalled another such visit I once made under similar difficultiesIt was at the San Francisco ExpositionI discovered by chance the so called Annex of the Fine Arts Buildinga stable like structure in comparison to the main buildingIt housed the NorwegianHungarianand Spanish exhibits by the wayalmost the only ones worth seeingAt that time another vision kept me from seeing the exhibit for some momentsIt seemed as if some short bald men danced along green velvet wallseach one plucking his heart beats with gusto andafter arranging them in a queer design on a crystal glass plateoffering them to the stars and childrenThis recollection cleared the air and I realized that surroundings have a strong effect on meI have come to enjoy the result of the finest faculty we possessour imaginationI have come to admire the result of a year s work of our Chicago ArtistsThree hundred and twenty one paintingssays my catalogand in order to simplify matters I decide to look at some of the most popular names first names usually found on the juriesArtistsaccording to Rodinare different from other mortals because they love their workLet us seeAdam Emory AlbrightAlfred JuergensLucie HartrathJohn FStaceyand DahlgreenEach one of them has between three and seven paintingsWith all that canvas they must have sailed on the most enchanting seasand surely have brought back a holiday for our eyes and heartsThe first one I encounter is An October Afternoon by MrAlfred Juergensvisions of little coral trees with hanging heads against a faint green dream skyembroidered brown leaves in the foreground and cool blue hills like thoughtless sighs in the backgroundappear on the catalog pageBut see what MrJuergens has done with this subjectI can scarcely believe my eyesA mushroom dog in front of some formless and lifeless trees amateur compositionthoughtless techniqueand dirty colorAnd MrJuergens has a steady job on the juryI wonder what is his reason for paintinghe certainly does not love his workSomething suddenly interferes with my thoughts on this subjectit is the jingling of coin in a visitor s pocketI look around and find number 174 by the same gentlemanand it reminds me of a cat walking on the keyboard of a stringless pianoThey say this is the best exhibition of the Chicago ArtistsIf it isMrJuergens has done nothing to make it goodHe has six such things on the wallsMrAlbrighta painter of children playing in the openhas seven pictures in the exhibitfive of them on one wallOne is called The Barn YardThe name reminds me of the reproduction of a painting by Malchevski I saw in a Polish library a few days agoIt was called Art in the Back Yard and showed a little satyr playing a flute for a little girl and a few turkeysThere was romance in the fence boardsand marvelously clean colorsit shouted life and joyMrAlbright s old maid s conception of childhood made me feel sadHis shapeless henshis flattened children on the wallweak compositiondirty colorsand no sign of life in the whole thingor feeling of out of door airAlmost disgustedI look furtherA Summer DreamI look for the dream and find it in the fact that the biggest of the boys has borrowed his older brother s headand the painting is full of some dirty yellow colorA horrible dreamI wish MrAlbright as well as MrJuergens would at least clean their pallets if they can not change their conception of thingsNext I visit Sunshine Alleyby Lucie HartrathIt is the alley of poverty of ideas and bad colorMiss Hartrath evidently wants to paint what she seesbut she does not happen to see anything startlingShetoohas six such things on the wallsThe mediocre work of John FStacey and Anna LStacey really deserves no attentionEspecially bad is the portrait of John by Annathere is little love expressed in itand The Beach RoadBelvedereCaliforniaby Johntakes the prize for being the poorest painting in the exhibitionJohn Fhas only one painting that looks as if it were made by a man who loves his work The Golden Hills of California31 The Little Review Next comes a man I dislike to place among the lollipop venders he being a very nice quiet and honest man but why does MrDahlgreen paint Nowwhen I come to MessrsGriffith and IrvineI find their aenemic work quite good in comparison to the work I have seen until nowOf courseI did not expect paintings with as wide a scope as the work of the Zubiaure BrothersZuologaEdward MunchHodlerWeltiMalchevskiFranzStuckFritz ErlerPutzElie Reppinetc to say nothing of the latest developments of modern art and ideals I mean the disciples of CezaneMatisseVan GoghGauguinetcbecause Chicago is still a frontier townAll the latest improvements plus the Art Institute cannot change its real charactera frontier town with frontier town idealsIn this caseall criticism being comparativeI did not look for the highest standardHad I done sothree words might have been my comprehensive criticismAs it isall I expected was clear feelingclean colorgood designand a certain amount of delicacy in handlingThis has been fulfilled only in a measure by MrBartlettwhose strength and individuality places him at the head of the landscape painters exhibitingHe reminds me very much of Trubnerespecially his Autumn AfternoonI also like his daring composition in Under Chinese TowerMunichPauline Palmer s work is full of broadly painted sunshinethough the foliage in some of her trees seems too heavy and shapelessNext in merit I think comes Marie Lokkewhose yellow sail in The Old Pier takes the wind out of many a neighborHermann More s A Summer Afternoonis a good example of clear feeling and clean color I also like MrKraft s delicate Silver Mist and An Autumn Afternoonand MrIngerles sThe Fascinating OzarksThere is also a class of painters who can best be described as able and honestAt the head of these artists stands MrPeyraud and Edward BButlerThere are also Frank VDudleyHLeon RoeckerEdgar SCameronJHCarlsenLawton ParkerCharles Francis BrownAHSchmidtWilliam WendtAlfred JanssonAlson ClarkKarl ABuehrGrace RavlinEdgar Payne and the following portrait paintersour own Franz HalsMrChristian AbrahamsenOscar GrossGordon StevensenCecil Clark Davis and Arvid NieholmMrWerner s mannerism is too monotonousMrUfers and MrHiggins have taken yellow ochre into the open and made good use of itI have taken these two men separately because both have done good work and I expect much improvement in the near futureTheir work at present looks too much like illustrationsMiss Dorothy Loeb is the only one who has a real sense of rhythm in lineThe Chicago Society of Artistswhich runs this exhibition every yearseems to be controlled at present by a number of men who have inherited a long discarded weak imitation of a technique once used by SegantiniThey have excluded almost everything that showed some originality and feelingbut have accepted and hung a few very poor and meaningless thingsso that they may shine by contrastHoweverit seems to me they are at the end of the ropeThe public refuses to buy the dope and their best men have sent in nothing to this showI refer to ClarksonReynoldsBettsOliver Dennet GroverHendersonRittman and Lawton Parker has only one little

I could findAmong the artists there was none that I liked better than Phil MayHis sense of the comic and his economy of line appealed to me and my lack of ability to drawHis Cockney folk gave me more pleasure than any of the staid humans I knewHe But I forget myselfI started out to write of Neil Lyons Al l the words I have spun for the prelude are merely to say that during my re reading of the work of Neil Lyons in the past few months I have been struck again and again by its likeness to the drawings of Phil May the same joythe same delight was there in the reading as there was in the contemplation of the drawingsNowthis likeness not only existed in the handling of the subjectbut also in the choice thereofThe Cockney menwomen and children that Phil May has drawn Neil Lyons has written aboutThe pictures of the peasantry that May has left are alike in line and spirit to those Lyons has drawn verbally in Cottage Pie and Moby LaneIf you know Phil May s work think of one of his drawings of a fat middle aged womanand then listen to this drawing of anotherby Neil LyonsShe was forty years old a ventureShe had lots mouth and a salmon col face and a pretence a nose and small watery All these amenities built up on a triple of chinwhich matched by an exceed amplitude of bosom waist Don t you recognize the same swiftsure linesBut I must get away from this parallelNever at his best is the artist as great as the writerThere is no line or collection of lines in May s work to match this in Lyons MrsGodgewho was lately the mother of twin babiesis now the mother of memories

gratitude Allan Ross Macdougall36 The Little Review The Reader Critic ANARCHY Alice GroffPhiladelphiaAnarchy is scientifically a reductio ad absurdum and those who claim to be anarchists are self deceiversminds that cannot complete a circuit of reasonThere is no place in reason for anarchyhence there is not and cannot be an anarchist on a basis of reasonAll who call themselves so are either archists of the most rabid sort or helpless flies in the sticky syrup of laissez faireThe only professed anarchists that make any impression upon the world are of three kinds either they are spirits of revolt of the most bitterlymaterialistically tyrannical sortor they are those who suffer with the oppressed and strive individually to set them freeeven to the point of self martyrdom or they are sentimentalists who maunder maudlinly on about love and justice and yet do absolutely nothing to bring about the love of justice or the justice of loveeither in their preaching or their practiceBut none of these are really anarchiststhey are only varieties of archists who wish to impose their own social ideals upon the social order in place of those that already prevailThe whole story of social evolution in a nutshell is as followsevery phase of the social order at any stage of social evolution is maintained by a social ego or group sufficiently powerful to dominate the rest of the surrounding social bodyand this phase can be changed only by revolutionbloodless or otherwiseon the part of a new social ego desiring this change and developing power to establish and maintain itNow the only way in which such a social ego can develop such power is by obtaining control of the means of livingfoodclothingshelterand the natural and financial resources back of these means and this control can be obtained only by archists dominationistsorganized into a social ego or group that is a unit on any special social idealRebellions come and rebellions gobut the only rebellion that ever reaches successful revolution is made by a social ego powerful enough to get control of the necessities of life by forceforce materialintellectualor psychicThis disposes forever pf the professed repudiation of force by the philosophical anarchistsso calledAs for the poetic anarchistswho draw moving pictures of the beautiful time to comewhen humanity will voluntarily organize to abolish all man made lawwhich they consider the only social evilnot realizing that the evil is not in lawper sebut in the kind of law and who look toMother Naturefor social guidance these will wait and look till the crack of doomin vainForMother Natureis an old wife of incredible stupiditysocially consideredand must needs be pulled up by the hair of her head at every whip stitchby her ever evolving offspringin order that they may transform her social stupidity into scientific truthSocial evolution depends entirely upon the discovery of such scientific truth and its application to the social orderand such application can be made only step by step through a social ego powerful enough to compel such applicationFrom this it may be seen that by whatever name we may call ourselvesmonarchistsdemocratsanarchistswe are really archists striving to impose our ideals as social egos upon the social orderand succeeding only when we can get control of the means of living in dominating the rest of the social body with themuntil a new social ego gets the power to cryThe king is dead Long live the kingItof coursegoes without saying that no social dominance has ever been entirely wise or beneficentand that until very recently in social history there has been no knowledge of sociological scientific truth to speak of upon which to base social dominationBut the hope of the world lies in the ever progressing discovery of such truthand in its application to the social order by ever evolving social egos that will more and more base their social ideals upon such truthgradually dominating the whole social order with ideals so based37 The Little Review Anonymous After having read yourA Deeper Musicin the February issue I wondered whether you had ever heard Mrde Pachmann play the pianoThere is nothing in the world like it nothing more wonderfulI am not speaking of an ebony Mason and Hamlin alone on a stagebut of any piano at allwith that madman bending his head over the keys of itI feel sure that had you heard him you would have included him in your article and would not have put words into Bauer s mouthYou would have known that it is possible to play the piano very badly and play it more beautifully than any one elseboth of these in one afternoonThe design of sound But hetoois becoming passé like PaderewskiBut there is little likelihood of a type arising from these twoDo you know of any one who plays the piano as Casals plays thecelloHave you looked at any of Scriabine s later piano piecesI wonder if he expresses any of the moods which you prophesy will be caught by some new composerI knew a boy in Petrograd who went to the conservatory every day with a volume of Scriabine and one of Bach under his armWe called him theScriabine chap He probably has had thirty second quavers punched into him by a German machine gunfor I am sure he couldn t or didn t dare be as loyal to both Nicholas and Wilhelm as he was to Scriabine and Johann S YesI have heard Pachmann many timesand he was always wonderfulI meantof courseto Put him in the articlebut at the last minute he slipped my mind perhaps because I was trying to write of adeepermusicand since Pachmann ismaster of the small essential thing and master of absolutely nothing elsehe doesn t quite come into the realm of the new vision of the piano Isn t there a good deal of similarity between Casalsplaying of thecello and Bauer s playing of the piano Scriabine s later piano things have something of what I meantand do you remember the piano parts ofPrometheus Stravinskytoo you know how he uses the piano inPètrouchka But the new vision is beyond these something more rich and shatteringI can t say itLet s just wait and seeThe EditorAlice
