that saw  From their pedantic Babylon The careless planets in their courses The stars fade out where the moon comes And took their tablets and made sums Yet did but look rocking the glittering coach Above the cloudy shoulders of the horses I would be for no knowledge is worth a straw Ignorant and wanton as the dawn   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  ON WOMAN  May God be praised for woman That gives up all her mind A man may find in no man A friendship of her kind That covers all he has brought As with her flesh and bone Nor quarrels with a thought Because it is not her own  Though pedantry denies It s plain the Bible means That Solomon grew wise While talking with his queens Yet never could although They say he counted grass Count all the praises due When Sheba was his lass When she the iron wrought or When from the smithy fire It shuddered in the water Harshness of their desire That made them stretch and yawn Pleasure that comes with sleep Shudder that made them one  What else he give or keep God grant me no not here   For I am not so bold To hope a thing so dear Now I am growing old But when if the tale s true The pestle of the moon That pounds up all anew Brings me to birth again To find what once I had And know what once I have known Until I am driven mad Sleep driven from my bed By tenderness and care Pity an aching head Gnashing of teeth despair And all because of some one Perverse creature of chance And live like Solomon That Sheba led a dance  THE FISHERMAN  Although I can see him still The freckled man who goes To a gray place on a hill In gray Connemara clothes At dawn to cast his flies It s long since I began To call up to the eyes   This wise and simple man All day I d looked in the face What I had hoped it would be To write for my own race And the reality The living men that I hate The dead man that I loved The craven man in his seat The insolent unreproved And no knave brought to book Who has won a drunken cheer The witty man and his joke Aimed at the commonest ear The clever man who cries The catch cries of the clown The beating down of the wise And great Art beaten down  Maybe a twelve month since Suddenly I began In scorn of this audience Imagining a man And his sun freckled face And gray Connemara cloth Climbing up to a place Where stone is dark with froth And the down turn of his wrist When the flies drop in the stream   A man who does not exist  A man who is but a dream  And cried Before I am old  I shall have written him one  Poem maybe as cold  And passionate as the dawn  THE HAWK  Call down the hawk from the air Let him be hooded or caged Till the yellow eye has grown mild For larder and spit are bare The old cook enraged The scullion gone wild  I will not be clapped in a hood Nor a cage nor alight upon wrist Now I have learnt to be proud Hovering over the wood In the broken mist Or tumbling cloud  What tumbling cloud did you cleave Yellow eyed hawk of the mind Last evening that I who had sat Dumbfounded before a knave Should give to my friend A pretence of wit   MEMORY  One had a lovely face And two or three had charm But charm and face were in vain Because the mountain grass Cannot but keep the form Where the mountain hare has lain  THE THORN TREE  She is foremost of those that I would hear praised I have gone about the house gone up and down As a man does who has published a new book Or a young girl dressed out in her new gown And though I have turned the talk by hook or crook Until her praise should be the uppermost theme A woman spoke of some new tale she had read A man so vaguely that he seemed to dream Of some strange woman s name that ran in his head  She is foremost of those that I would hear praised I will talk no more of books or the long war But walk by the dry thorn until I have found Some beggar sheltering from the wind and there If there be rags enough he will know her name And be well pleased remembering it for in the old days Though she had young men s praise and old men s blame Among the poor both old and young gave her praise   THE PHOENIX  What have I earned for all that work I said For all that I have done at my own charge The daily spite of this unmannerly town Where who has served the most is most defamed The reputation of his lifetime lost Between the night and morning I might have lived And you know well how great the longing has been Where every day my footfall should have lit In the green shadow on Ferrara wall Or climbed among the images of the past The unperturbed and courtly images Evening and morn the steep street of Urbino To where the duchess and her people talked The stately midnight through until they stood In their great window looking at the dawn I might have had no friend that could not mix Courtesy and passion into one like those That saw the wicks grow yellow in the dawn I might have used the one substantial right My trade allows chosen my company And chosen what scenery had pleased me best  Thereon my phoenix answered in reproof The drunkards pilferers of public funds All the dishonest crowd I had driven away When my luck changed and they dared to meet my face   Crawled from obscurity and set upon me Those I had served and some that I had fed Yet never have I now nor any time Complained of the people  All I could reply Was You that have not lived in thought but deed Can have the purity of a natural force But I whose virtues are the definitions Of the analytic mind can neither close The eye of the mind nor keep my tongue from speech  And yet because my heart leaped at her words I was abashed and now they come to mind After nine years I sink my head abashed  THERE IS A QUEEN IN CHINA  There is a queen in China or maybe it s in Spain And birthdays and holidays such praises can be heard Of her unblemished lineaments a whiteness with no stain That she might be that sprightly girl who had married with  a bird And there s a score of duchesses surpassing womankind Or who have found a painter to make them so for pay And smooth out stain and blemish with the elegance of his  mind I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day   The young men every night applaud their Gaby s laughing eye And Ruth St Denis had more charm although she had  poor luck From nineteen hundred nine or ten Pa lova s had the cry And there s a player in The States who gathers up her cloak And flings herself out of the room when Juliet would be  bride With all a woman s passion a child s imperious way And there are but no matter if there are scores beside I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day  There s Margaret and Marjorie and Dorothy and Nan A Daphne and a Mary who live in privacy One s had her fill of lovers another s had but one Another boasts I pick and choose and have but two or  three If head and limb have beauty and the instep s high and light They can spread out what sail they please for all I have to  say Be but the breakers of men s hearts or engines of delight I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day  There ll be that crowd to make men wild through all the centuries And may be there ll be some young belle walk out to make men wild   Who is my beauty s equal though that my heart denies But not the exact likeness the simplicity of a child And that proud look as though she had gazed into the  burning sun And all the shapely body no tittle gone astray I mourn for that most lonely thing and yet God s will be  done I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day  TH E SCHOLARS  Bald heads forgetful of their sins Old learned respectable bald heads Edit and annotate the lines That young men tossing on their beds Rhymed out in love s despair To flatter beauty s ignorant ear  They ll cough in the ink to the world s end Wear out the carpet with their shoes Earning respect have no strange friend If they have sinned nobody knows Lord what would they say Should their Catullus walk that way  William Butler Yeats   IN LONDON  CONES  The blue mist of after rain Fills all the trees  The sunlight gilds the tops Of the poplar spires far off  Here a branch sways And there a sparrow twitters  The curtain s hem rose embroidered Flutters and half reveals A burnt red chimney pot  The quiet in the room Bears patiently A footfall on the street  GLOOM  I sat there in the dark Of the room and of my mind Thinking of men s treasons and bad faith Sinking into the pit of my own weakness Before their strength of cunning Out over the gardens came the sound of someone Playing five finger exercises on the piano   Then I gathered up within me all my powers Until outside of me was nothing I was all All stubborn fighting sadness and revulsion  And one came from the garden quietly And stood beside me She laid her hand on my hair She laid her cheek on my forehead And caressed me with it But all my being rose to my forehead To fight against this outside thing Something in me became angry Withstood like a wall And would allow no entrance I hated her  What is the matter with you dear she said Nothing I answered I am thinking She stroked my hair and went away And I was still gloomy angry stubborn  Then I thought She has gone away she is hurt She does not know What poison has been working in me   Then I thought Upstairs her child is sleeping And I felt the presence Of the fields we had walked over the roads we had followed The flowers we had watched together Before it came  She had touched my hair and only then did I feel it And I loved her once again  TERROR  Eyes are tired The lamp burns And in its circle of light Papers and books lie Where chance and life Have placed them  Silence sings all around me My head is bound with a band Outside in the street a few footsteps A clock strikes the hour  I gaze and my eyes close Slowly  I doze but the moment before sleep A voice calls my name   In my ear And the shock jolts my heart But when I open my eyes And look first left and then right   No one is there  EVIL  The mist of the evening is rose In the dying sun And the street is quiet between its rows of plane trees And the walls of the gardens With the laurel bushes  I walk along in a dream Half aware Of the empty black of the windows  One window I pass by It is not empty Something shows from it white I feel and round Something that pulls me back To gaze still dreaming To gaze and to wake and stare At a naked woman Oh beautiful Alone in the window   Evil  Is there a sign Does she call me What is the lure  She does not move  And I crawl to the gate and stop And open the gate again stopping And crawl again up the stone steps Fear driving my heart mad Up to the door  Door do not open Though I beat you with my fists  WAR TIME  If I go out of the door It will not be To take the road to the left that leads Past the bovine quiet of houses Brooding over the cud of their daily content Even though The tranquility of their gardens Is a lure that once was stronger Even though From privet hedge and mottled laurel The young green peeps And the daffodils And the yellow and white and purple crocuses   Laugh from the smooth mould Of the garden beds To the upright golden buds of the chestnut trees I shall not see The almond blossom shaming The soot black boughs  But to the right the road will lead me To greater and greater disquiet Into the swift rattling noise of the motor busses And the dust the tattered paper The detritus of a city That swirls in the air behind them I will pass the shops where the prices Are judged day by day by the people And come to the place where five roads meet With five tram routes And where amid the din Of the vans the lorries the motor busses The clangorous tram cars The news is shouted And soldiers gather off duty  Here I can feel the heat of Europe s fever And I can make As each man makes the beauty of the woman he loves No spring and no woman s beauty While that is burning  F S Flint   BUDS  We went we both were boiling young one night To see six bouts on never mind the street And passed beneath a gas lamp s ghastly light  A woman of prey no longer fair her feet Long turned towards death My comrade knew she came From Ardmore town where still they buzzed her shame  He hailed her by a childish name which nigh Had been forgotten surely never heard Since days in quiet Ardmore long gone by  Irrevocable Buds why Buds the word Of what was gone She hid her face in pain With God knows what hell ringing through her brain  What arrows then of utter woe might stir Her trampled soul I have no skill to guess The white name fouled against the front of her  The name of hope mocking her hopelessness However being boiling young that night We phrased no moral went and saw the fight  William Laird   EASTLAND WATERS  Niels Now girls now girls cling on

left But the enemy keeps on bombarding apparently to pass the time  She passed the hours  In a friendly solitude  Heard the voices wrangling shrewd  In the market place of flowers Clatter of cart wheel sounds that drifted From open window saw uplifted  Her cathedral towers  While passed the hours Her thoughts would find some little song Loved for many a year and long  In the market place of flowers When days of summer drifted drifted And in the peaceful sky were lifted  Ypres cathedral towers  To pass the hours Since her last scream was choked in dust Shot and shrapnel spend their lust  In the market place of flowers Smoke is drifted drifted drifted Lonely in the sky are lifted  Christ s cathedral towers   Dread  DREAD  Scarlet ruinous roses Unfolding under the sea Though far in the deep and slow of growth They call to me call to me  Day long I serve my father s need I do the housework duly Dusk nor the idle stars I heed I say my night prayers truly  Scarlet poisonous roses Unfolded under the sea Far off slow and of tangled growth They call to me cling to me  NOCTURNE  Which is the lovelier between clear spaces of the lake and the night sky The mountain edges against heaven or shadow of the mountains in the water Which light more lovely keen stars burning big in the purple darkness Or star shimmer in the depths thin lines like wavering lanterns   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FAILURE  Visions are piled up on the morning skies With great cloud bastion arch of mist and spire Soaring to win the sun s first golden fire  The spacious mansions of the soul arise  Grateful of heart fresh dedicated wise I to my earthly task at heaven s hire Eagerly turn and fear no more to tire  Now such a hope is bright before mine eyes  But toward the close of day the scented air Thrills to a murmur and a beat of wings Twilight is veiled Who stirs can Love be there  No answer on his careless flight he flings But was there not a summons of shy laughter I turn I tremble swift I follow after  CHARM  Charm It is color of the rose by twilight The silver note that shivered crystal yields It is a rainbow caught in the blown fountain A light wind winging its pathway through the fields  G Tucker Bispham   OLD MANUSCRIPT  The sky Is that beautiful old parchment In which the sun And the moon Keep their diary To read it all One must be a linguist More learned than Father Wisdom And a visionary  More clairvoyant than Mother Dream But to feel it One must be an apostle One who is more than intimate In having been always The only confidant Like the earth Or the sea  Alfred Kreymborg   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POSTPONEMENT  When Albert F McComb Died in his native Dodgetown At the age of sixty odd People said the few who said anything at all That he had lived a futile life And that Europe was to blame His continual hankering after the Old World Had made him a failure in the New  At seventeen he was reading In Dickens land just out And Ruskin s Stones of Venice And Maudle s Life of Raphael And he was never the same afterward He decided on romance  Romance with Albert was always a good bit back And some distance away Least of all in booming Dodgetown In the year of grace eighteen seventy three There was Shelley poetizing in Pisa  Thirty five years before Albert was born And there was Byron with his countess In that conspiratorial old palace at Ravenna Four thousand wide miles from Main Street Or more Etcetera  At twenty one Albert took a position But he never put his heart into the work   Postponement  At twenty five he might have bought a share in the business But No he said I may cross over soon Let me be foot free and fancy free no entanglements here  When he was twenty six Adelaide Waters tired of waiting Married an ambitious young hardware dealer And on the whole did well But Albert cared little She was waiting on the other side  Early he became a boarder And a boarder he continued to be Why tie myself up with property he asked The time will come and I must be without constraint  Thus without constraint without career without estate Without home and family He waited for the great hour Living on slick steel engravings And flushed mendacious chromo lithographs And ecstatic travel books penned by forlorn English spinsters  In the new West others wooed Fortune and won her But Albert was spending fortune on fortune abroad Before he had fairly learned to pay his way at home He lived in a palace on the Lung Arno He saw the yellow river plainly enough From the back window of the two story frame on Ninth  Street   He went to the office in a plum colored coat Of the cut of the early twenties And a voluminous stock Though others might see but mixed goods And a four in hand Some damsel principessa or contadina Hung on his lips or carelessly betrayed his heart And he the young poet Though he had never written a line Such stuff as this having not yet been invented Lay down in dreamless slumber beside Keats Close to the walls of Rome  Some years passed by But Albert never budged from home Savings grew slowly no kindly patron appeared no rich  relation died But less and less did Albert live In terms of Dodgetown and of Caldwell County It was all Lambeth and Lincoln s Inn and Bridgewater  House The Schwarzwald and the Forest of Arden The cypresses of Verona the cascades of Tivoli And the Pincian Hill  At forty Albert was getting a lukewarm salary for lukewarm work And some small five and a half per cent investments   Postponement  Brought in three hundred and thirty dollars extra per annum In two or three years I shall risk going he would say And then   But if Albert stayed single all his sisters did not And if he himself kept on living several of his adult rela  tives died And when he was fifty two a bunch of grand nieces Asked him to help on their grocery bills And to see that their mortgage interest got paid on time Other things of like nature happened And Albert presently perceived that not every single man Can escape the obligations and responsibilities of the married  state Well I must wait he said And he began to collect views of the Dolomites  Albert prosed along past sixty As our muse indicated at the start His young relatives grew up And some of them married And those who remained single Were cared for by their sisters husbands And one day Albert got word That a wealthy cousin twice removed Who had made millions out of the Michigan forests And had multiplied them into tens of millions on the stock  exchange   And whom he had not heard from for twenty years Had crossed as Albert liked to say And had left him a fortune indeed  Albert sent for steamship folders But a dubious July Was followed by a frenetic August The ancient world So grandiose and so romantic To Albert s steadfast eyes Went mad  Man marks the earth with ruin he mused But his control Stops with the  Yet the sea itself was become a shambles And the realm of faery beyond A trampled mire of blood and wreckage  Albert stood on the brink of things as ever But the earth heaved beneath his feet And the fabric reared through forty years fell in ruin on  his head There will be no peace in my time he murmured Nor any salve in generations For me there is no world at all What is my million here  Albert retired He studied the stripes in the wall paper   And considered his weak old hands on the counterpane His eyes were become too dim to see the Here and Now Or to divine the local glories Just About to Be In a negative way he had been a good enough man And Heaven will do he sighed But has it a Val d Arno a Villa d Este  Or   But you kind friend and reader  Shall have the last word here And mind you choose it well  Henry B Fuller  EDITORIAL COMMENT  THE QUESTION OF PRIZES  T is impossible to please everybody POETRY has  been criticized in various quarters because of  its annual honor list When the question of  prizes came up for discussion recently in New  York at a meeting of the Poetry Society of America the associate editor of this magazine was almost the only speaker who advocated prize giving for the encouragement of the art By other speakers and since then by two or three writers various objections have been suggested that the offering and giving of prizes is mere sentimentalism and pretentiousness that justice in awards is improbable or even impossible that there is a subtle corruption in a prize the winner thereof becoming so consumed with self satisfaction as to lose his artistic integrity that such awards are an effort to create not poetry but a market for poetry an effort to make poetry popular Et cetera  So we may as well refer once more to a few first principles which led to the founding of the magazine The fundamental principle was perhaps this that a great period in any department of human activity comes only when a strong and widespread creative impulse meets an equal impulse of sympathy Genius happens individually of course and having happened even at the darkest place and hour it may discover itself and function to a certain degree   The Question of Prizes  though spasmodically and incompletely in spite of the world s indifference But the chances against it are numerous and severe unnourished the precious seed may dry up or after an early efflorescence the plant may perish or but why pursue the parable  Great art has usually been popular to this extent that in the great periods of art the artists had their world behind them they felt it pushing and urging them and their power was multiplied tenfold just as today we are in the midst of a great period of scientific discovery because every inventive mind feels this push of his world In such a period the crowd does not fully understand the great man and his work but it watches him and admires or at least reviles its Shakespeare was not an immortal but a popular playwright its Raphael not a great master but a favorite painter These men were doing something which the crowd wanted and was interested in they were expressing the crowd s ideas and desires as well as much more And without the crowd s open or secret interest and sympathy or at least opposition their work would have been less triumphantly done  It follows that if we want great poetry we must begin by preparing normal and natural conditions for the poet by giving him not the stone walls and stifling atmosphere of indifference but light air freedom neighbors who praise or curse all things necessary for healthy growth and conflict Only thus will the great creative mind if it is born have a fair chance of attaining powerful maturity and just   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  as hundreds of lesser trees must grow and die to enrich the soil for one that overtops them so only out of the growth and decay and waste of lesser creative minds will the master arise  POETRY its policy and prizes are a detail of preparation an effort to give the poet his chance of a hearing his right to a response It is an effort to gather the great audience whether few or many for whom and through whose aid alone he can sing with his utmost power  In this effort the editor has taken lessons from the sister arts of painting and sculpture whose recent development in this country has been due at least partly to galleries exhibitions prizes scholarships and other evidences of public interest This in spite of fallible juries of admission and award for since Sargent in a Chicago exhibition back in the nineties received not a first but a second medal for his Carmencita she has had little reason to expect such awards to be prophetic of the verdict of time  POETRY S juries even though Apollo should appoint them would no doubt prove quite as fallible But however our wise descendants may smile at our awards these will have accomplished in a measure their object of honor to the art As to the individual honored he becomes at once the target for such unflattering comments that his modesty is in little danger and the bag of gold he receives is not yet heavy enough to overbalance his artistic integrity At least Mr Sandburg seems as granite like as ever and Mr Lindsay goes serenely on his way   Poets are the worst paid of all artists and we can not see that we would lessen their chance of immortality by lessening their chance of starvation Why should a poet be utterly lacking in self respect if he accepts a fellowship when so many painters and architects scholars and scientists have stood up nobly under the infliction We know more than one young poet whose art would be benefited by a traveling scholarship more than that of the numerous painters who now enjoy this boon  Miss Monroe led us to suppose she was building a cathedral it now appears that it was a Woolworth Building says one critic A cathedral did I Modern cathedrals are second rate mere imitations I would rather build a first rate sky scraper But not the Woolworth Building the Monadnock perhaps H M  THE WORK OF EZRA POUND  If I were driven to name one individual who in the English language by means of his own examples of creative art in poetry has done most of living men to incite new impulses in poetry the chances are I would name Ezra Pound  This statement is made reservedly out of knowing the work of Pound and being somewhat close to it three years or so I hope that no luck of war or peace will ever back me into a corner where by force and duress I must lie shackled and hungry in a donjon keep until I name the world s champion poet If however as a friendly stranger in a smoking compartment you should casually ask me for   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  an offhand opinion as to who is the best man writing poetry today I should probably answer Ezra Pound  All talk on modern poetry by people who know ends with dragging in Ezra Pound somewhere He may be named only to be cursed as wanton and mocker poseur trifler and vagrant Or he may be classed as filling a niche today like that of Keats in a preceding epoch The point is he will be mentioned  One must know how to spell his name and have heard rumors of where he hangs his hat when he eats and one must have at least passing acquaintance with his solemn de nunciadoes and his blurted quiddities in order to debate on modern poetry and in such debate zigzag a course of progress  When Nicodemus wanted to know more about the real Jesus of Nazareth he had the justice to make a night call and ask Jesus some questions  Let some of those thrusting spears and ink pots at Ezra  Pound try to be fair enough to read him  In the early regulations of the University of Paris this oath was required of professors I swear to read and to finish reading within the time set by the statutes the books and parts of books assigned for my lectures Some like form should be insisted on for reviewers and commentators who in this push button and dumb waiter age rush into type with two minute judgments on twenty year accomplishments  Though a Fabre spends ninety years watching spiders and  writing a book any ordinary book reviewer or critic now   adays will type hap hazard a column of words on the work of a lifetime and assume without humility or prayer to say this is good and that is bad  Though an Ezra Pound toil ten years at one aim and coin high joy and red life into a commanding book of poetry there are plenty of offhand scholars who assume that he means nothing to anybody because he means nothing to them  The opposition to Pound divides roughly into two groups first the mumbo jumbo school who assert with grave faces that this sort of poetry has never before been written and therefore it is not poetry and second the pish tush school whose risibilities are tickled with turning the poems upside down inside out or backwards and forwards  In the cool and purple meantime Pound goes ahead producing new poems having the slogan Guts and Efficiency emblazoned above his daily program of work His genius runs to various schools and styles He acquires traits and then throws them away One characteristic is that he has no characteristics He is a new roamer of the beautiful a new fetcher of wild shapes in each new handful of writings offered us  Maybe it is a psalm of his glory in certain old roads where the hills part in three ways where also he has seen the copper come down tingeing the mountains and sunset torch flames painting the front of that church Maybe it is a London girl combing her hair and he watches her across the street from his room and wonders pleasantly   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  about her till she sings and her voice sends him running from the rasp of its falsetto Th e old old things that are always lovely haunt him whether they move on the faces of women petals of flowers waves of moonlight or the waters of Venice by night which he gives in murmurous lines like these  And the beauty of this thy Venice hast thou shown unto me Until is its loveliness become unto me a thing of tears  O God what great kindness have we done in times past and forgotten it  That thou givest this wonder unto us O God of waters  O God of the night what great sorrow Cometh unto us that thou thus repayest us Before the time of its coming  From these soft waters and this gentle blurred nocturne he may turn to this picture and its hard movement  Gray cliffs  and beneath them A sea Harsher than granite  unstill never ceasing  Or his translation of Bertrans de Born s ballad of the  lover of war wherein the master speaks to his jongleur Papiol in this wise  And I love to see the sun rise blood crimson And I watch his spears through the dark clash And it fills all my heart with rejoicing   And pries wide my mouth with fast music  The man who fears war and squats opposing  My words for stour hath no blood of crimson  But is fit only to rot in womanish peace  Papiol Papiol to the music  May God damn forever all who cry Peace  Though the Vorticist school now claims Pound and he endorses the claim he is also an ancient of the ancients His translations from the Chinese are vivid in feeling and keen in sympathy One realizes the closeness of the Chinese soul as a next door human neighbor fellow traveler on an old old planet after reading Cathay  Drawing a style of writing from hitherto obscure Romance literature and the troubadours from the Chinese and the Egyptian from modern science Nietzsche and syndicalism the technique of Pound baffles any accurate analysis in a single paper His own statements of his theories do not get at the gist of the matter and he passes his warmest inspirations to others through poems in the actual instead of theoretic  As well should one reduce to chemical formula the crimson of a Kentucky redbird s wing as dissect the inner human elements that give poetic craft to this heart song from Planh  But if one should look at me with the old hunger in her eyes How will I be answering her eyes  For I have followed the white folk of the forest  Aye It s a long hunting And it s a deep hunger I have when I see them a gliding And a flickering there where the trees stand apart   But oh it is sorrow and sorrow When love dies down in the heart  He has prowled in streets taprooms libraries and lexicons Out of a mixed lore gathered among hooligans bookmen and beautiful women he projects such films as these  FRANCESCA You came in out of the night And there were flowers in your hands Now you will come out of a confusion of people Out of a turmoil of speech about you  I who have seen you amid the primal things Was angry when they spoke your name In ordinary places I would that the cool waves might flow over my mind And that the world should dry as a dead leaf Or as a dandelion seed pod and be swept away So that I might find you again Alone  ON HIS OWN FACE IN A GLASS O strange face there in the glass O ribald company O saintly host O sorrow swept my fool What answer O ye myriad That strive and play and pass Jest challenge counterlie I I I  And ye  LI PO And Li Po also died drunk He tried to embrace a moon In the yellow river  ANCIENT WISDOM  So Shu dreamed And having dreamed that he was a bird a bee a butterfly   The Work of Ezra Pound  He was uncertain why he should try to feel like anything else Hence his contentment  Out of thousands of Christ poems there are not a dozen that live on shining with the luminous power of the Christ life Judges like William Butler Yeats say Pound s Ballad of the Goodly Fere will last These are two of its fourteen verses  I ha seen him cow a thousand men On the hills o Gallilee They whined as he walked out calm between Wi his eyes like the gray o the sea Like the sea that brooks no voyaging  With the winds unleashed and free Like the sea that he cowed at Genseret Wi twey words spoke suddenly  On the fly leaf of a book of Italian translations Ezra  Pound wrote  The reader must bear in mind that these poems were written one by one It is impossible to read the book straight through with any pleasure It is unfair to Guido to attempt it The poem of the close school is a subject for meditation It is best to read one at a time Four or five together are all that should ever be tried  The same counsel goes for those who take up the collected works of Ezra Pound These are not in the same class with reading matter farmers buy from mail order houses to while away long winter nights and the rainy season A piece like this keeps its music through more than a hundred readings  Beautiful infinite memories That are a plucking at my heart Why will you be ever calling and a calling   And a murmuring in the dark there And a reaching out your long hands Between me and my beloved  And why will you be ever a casting The black shadows of your beauty On the white face of my beloved And a glinting in the pools of her eyes  His way of working his art and craftsmanship is more conscious and deliberate more clear cut in purpose and design than might be thought from first glance at the careless surface of one of his free running poems While he is an ignorant barbarian on the sources of his inspiration and the power by which he works out his inward flashes once the urge and blaze is on him he works by rules measurements formulae and data as strict and definite as any worker who uses exact science and employs fractions of inches and drills in steel by thousandths of millimeters These two sentences may offer clues to the intuitions that guide him  Poetry is a sort of inspired mathematics which gives us equations not for abstract figures triangles spheres and the like but equations for the human emotions If one have a mind which inclines to magic rather than science one will prefer to speak of these equations as spells or incantations it sounds more arcane mysterious recondite  Since he wrote the foregoing in The Spirit of Romance some years ago he has been joined with the Imagists and from them passed on to the Vorticists Wyndham Lewis in Blast starts with the Red Indian and then cites Poe Whistler Henry James and Walt Whitman ending with Ezra Pound as the high points of American art These are Lewis notes on Pound   The Work of Ezra Pound  Demon pantechnicon driver busy with removal of old world into new quarters In his steel net of impeccable technique he has lately caught Li Po Energy of a discriminating element  People write poetry because they want to It functions in them as air in the nostrils of an athlete in a sprint Moods thoughts emotions surge over writers as they do over inventors and politicians It is a dark stuff of life that comes and goes  There are those who play safe and sane in poetry as in mechanics and politics To each realm its own gay madmen Some win their public while they live Others must mould a very small public while alive and be content with a larger one after death Still others need no public at all and in the rôle of by standers they get more enjoyment and knowledge of life than as performers  In a world with so high a proportion of fools it is neither disgrace nor honor when people say of a finished work I can t understand it The last word on the merits of it will be spoken by the future And sometimes the future decides that a work is beautiful and worth treasuring and then ironically destroys it and leaves behind no word of explanation nor apology  I like the pages of Ezra Pound He stains darkly and touches softly The flair of great loneliness is there He is utter as a prairie horseman a biplane in the azure a Norse crag or any symbol of the isolate contemplative spirit of man unafraid and searching He is worth having  Carl Sandburg   TH E LATER YEATS  Yeats in his later work all things considered is really the most characteristic poet of modern Europe He has more than any other continental writer that virile pessimism which has haunted Europe for the last quarter of a century he celebrates subtly and strangely that aristocratic idea which in our day has again become paramount in Europe and his work has in full measure the pride and anger which are the only two of the seven deadly sins which produce great literature Great literature like great wars always derives from somebody s pride or somebody s anger  The later Yeats may be said to begin with the publication by the Cuala Press in 1910 of The Green Helmet and Other Poems and continues with further developments in the volume Responsibilities published last year This later work differs from his early work in vocabulary and in an impassioned directness of expression acquired through years of working for the theatre It is an attempt to get nearer the ordinary things of life an attempt to grapple with common and topical interests city councils political intrigues music hall dancers etc The nearer he gets to these things the more tragic and personal does he become so that the joyousness as of a man out on a great adventure which characterized the work of his youth is all gone but in its stead there is the virility of one who has come unto his strength  When we compare The Dream of a Blessed Spirit espe   The Later Yeats  daily what William Archer called the white heat of inspiration of its last stanza  With white feet of angels seven Her white feet go glimmering And above the deep of heaven Flame on flame and wing on wing  and the melancholy splendor of the following poem out of Responsibilities we see the difference between poetry about a dream and poetry about a living reality to which the whole  experience of the life of a man has gone in the making  Suddenly I saw the cold and rock delighting Heaven That seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice And thereupon imagination and heart were driven So wild that every casual thought of that and this Vanished and left but memories that should be out of season With the hot blood of youth of love crossed long ago And I took all the blame out of all sense and reason Until I cried and trembled and rocked to and fro Riddled with light Ah when the ghost begins to quicken  Confusion of the death bed over is it sent  Out naked on the roads as the books say and stricken With the injustice of the skies for punishment  In his early work he brought back again the old Irish legends and folk tales in his later work he has brought back that imaginative and impassioned satire which used to be the birth gift of the old Gaelic bards Synge who put the woman who hated The Playboy in a poem and cursed her so to speak with candle book and bell is less frightening than Yeats who with such simple and homely words satirizes treacherous friends bad poets and ignorant despisers of art  The first of the volumes mentioned contains The Green  Helmet which is the most characteristic of all Irish plays   This play which is an heroic satire is I believe Mr Yeats greatest dramatic work It is remarkable as the first play in English written in ballad metre It satirizes Irish quarrelsomeness but it also pays a tribute to the heroic element which is always in Irish life Mary M Colum  THE DEATH OF STEPHEN PHILLIPS  Two poets have died during the past month and one actress dear to lovers of great poetry Stuart Merrill the American who gave up his native land and language to sit at the feet of Mallarmé and become a French symbolist poet of high distinction Ada Rehan whose Rosalind and Katharine will never be forgotten by anyone who saw her beauty enrich these rôles and heard her voice drip golden honey over the magic cadences of the lines And Stephen Phillips  Fifteen years ago there would have been a veritable clangor of bells to usher out this poet What were people thinking of him then In this case genius is no illusion the footfall of the immortals said Blackwood s One who redeems our age from its comparative barrenness in the higher realms of poetry said W L Courtney He has achieved the impossible said William Archer And Churton Collins said of Paolo and Francesca in the Saturday Review It claims his kinship with the aristocrats of his art with Sophocles and with Dante  Such overpraise was an injustice against a poet of rich fancy with a delicate feeling for tonal cadences It is hardly too much to say that it ruined him for it urged him toward   tragic drama for which he was unfitted as he utterly lacked original creative power He relied upon a secondary inspiration and dramatized famous old stories until the futility of an effort beyond his strength may have been the ultimate cause of his years of silence  In my opinion Paolo and Francesca the first of these modern embroiderings on a grand old pattern is the best It is not drama but it has passages of clear and limpid poetry though hardly better than some of the earlier poems especially Marpessa and Christ in Hades which had already proved the musical fluidity of his blank verse Usually the quieter scenes are the most convincing In the one between Francesca and Lucrezia for example when the lonely young wife breaks down the older woman s reserve poignant emotion is exquisitely expressed  I have no mother let me be your child  Tonight I am so utterly alone  Be gentle with me or if not at least  Let me go home this world is difficult  Oh think of me as of a little child  That looks into your face and asks your hand  And Giovanni s lines at the end of the play are fine in their suggestion of utter calmness like that of a spirit who has passed through death  Not easily have we three come to this  We three who now are dead Unwillingly  They loved unwillingly I slew them Now  I kiss them on the forehead quietly  It was cruel for this poet of delicate sensibilities to impose on his frail imagination such themes as Ulysses and Herod They never came to life the splendid symbolism of the one   the gorgeous brutality of the other and the old world grandeur of both were smothered in thick veils Ulysses visit to Hades Herod s mad passion become artificialities which no one believes in least of all probably the poet No wonder he lost himself under the strain And of his last work Armageddon his epic drama of the war it is kinder to say nothing  One cannot predict what the future will say of him But at any rate he had fine moments moments of real feeling expressed with high simplicity in softly flowing limpid music One of his Herod s speeches seems almost personal he was duped by brightness  She would she hath forgiven all Yet cannot traverse with her feet those yards That separate us If she would but cannot I tell you we are fooled by the eye the ear These organs muffle us from that real world That lies about us we are duped by brightness The ear the eye doth make us deaf and blind  H M  REVIEWS  The Collected Poems of Rupert Brooke with an introduction by George Edward Woodberry and a Biographical Note by Margaret Lavington John Lane Co It is a difficult thing to judge the work of a poet the cir  cumstances of whose death have given to the world that sense of heroic glamour for which the public loves dearly to honor its poets Chatterton Keats and Shelley Lord Byron and Sir Philip Sidney have had their share of it And now it is the turn of Rupert Brooke whose personal beauty like   that of Byron and Shelley accentuates a loss which is none the less severe Reactions follow upon enthusiasms but quite irrespective of all glamour Rupert Brooke left several poems that will outlast present public acclaim as the work of other genuine poets has often had to outlast public scorn  A reviewer can do no more than honestly record his individual impression I had read I think practically all the poems published in this book while Rupert Brooke was still living and I still think as I thought then that the double sonnet Menelaus and Helen and the five sonnets including the now famous one which serves as his epitaph represent his finest achievement Much of Rupert Brooke s work expresses the exuberance of youth it represents the will to love or the will to die and the straining desire towards the white flame of poetry characteristic of young poets rather than definite achievement Brooke was in love with death long before the war came his poems are full of this hunger and desire for death as the consummation and preserver of beauty and this in itself is characteristic of the adolescent poet before life has been fully realized Brooke ran toward death as toward the consummation which life had not given perhaps could not have given to one of his temperament He went toward death as the great lover not of life as he thought but of death itself There are men of whom this is true Brooke was one of them This in no sense belittles his heroic sacrifice for he had everything to live for  The greater part of Brooke s work is fluent exuberant rhapsodic and often reminiscent now of Yeats now of John   Masefield as in The Great Lover which reflects the spirit and cadences of Biography now of Swinburne and often of the seventeenth century poets in his use of the rhymed couplet He had an individual turn nevertheless which made one sure that he would become more self expressive in form as well as in content The war or the anticipation of death gave Brooke an intensity clarity and a greater degree of precision than he had attained before except in one or two instances In many of the earlier poems the feeling for words and for the sound of them rather embalmed and obscured the sense and the image Had he survived the war he would certainly have gained in depth and richness of experience and in austerity of expression Much of his work is frankly playful in intent this is part of its charm for many people and for others a serious defect This was probably temperamental Some poets conceal sensitiveness in this way others by satire Whether Brooke was content that his work should remain so we may not know He was only twenty eight when he died  His death is a symbol of the waste of war  A C H  The Song of Hugh Glass by John G Neihardt Macmillan This book brings up certain interesting questions It is a  story of adventure and emotion based upon an episode of the American fur trade nearly a century ago and told in rhymed couplets Its diction is of an old fashioned elegance employing freely words long sacred to poetry like ere unto   Reviews  deem athwart guerdon and phrases like howsoe er twas what thing be sought nor might it e er befall though this e er is misspelled ere etc Although often the story swings along simply enough there are many passages of round and rolling eloquence which tread the stage with a noble mien like this  The moon now cleared the world s end and the owl Gave voice unto the wizardry of light While in some dim lit chancel of the night Shouts to the goddess wolfish corybants Intoned their wild antiphonary chants The oldest saddest worship in the world  or this  Nor long Hugh let the lust of vengeance gnaw Upon him idling though the tale he told And what report proclaimed him were as gold To buy a winter s comfort at the Post I can not rest for I am but the ghost Of someone murdered by a friend he said So long as yonder traitor thinks me dead Aye buried in the bellies of the crows And kiotes  In short Mr Neihardt has done his task well He has fitted his wild western story to a long accepted heroic measure and compelled it to move with dignity in this stately dress Th e trouble is that the process does not seem quite natural he has fitted the story to the measure instead of letting it choose its form and somehow the nobility and high sounding rotundity of the poem do not satisfy us W e compare it with examples of perfect fitness between subject and form like certain tales by Kipling and Stephen Crane or like the confessions of Doc Hill and William H Herndon   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  in Spoon River and at once it becomes artificial mere literature  Poetic narrative must stand the test of comparison with prose It must be as fit and fine as prose as lithe and stript and shapely and a bit more It can not cover itself with the trappings of yesterday and make gesticulation pass for life Such art smells of the old time theatre It is like what our fathers used to call a mighty fine piece of acting  Of course Mr Neihardt is an accomplished craftsman and there are in his poem passages of fine simplicity and stately music Also his similes are often fortunate Perhaps such excerpts as these present him at his best  For he went grayer like a poplar tree That shivers ruffling to the first faint breath Of storm while yet the world is still as death Save where far off the kenneled thunders bay  It was the hour when cattle straggle home Across the clearing in a hush of sleep They saunter lowing loiter belly deep Amid the lush grass by the meadow stream How like the sound of water in a dream The intermittent tinkle of yon bell A windlass creaks contentment from a well And cool deeps gurgle as the bucket sinks Now blowing at the trough the plow team drinks The shaken harness rattles Sleepy quails Call far The warm milk hisses in the pails There in the dusky barn lot Crickets cry The meadow twinkles with the glowing fly One hears the horses munching at their oats The green grows black A veil of slumber floats Across the haunts of home enamored men  H M   Poems by G K Chesterton John Lane  One opens with pleasure a book by the author of Pope and the Art of Satire and is at the outset well disposed towards a writer so catholic and democratic in his discriminations Metrical form has not however helped what Mr Chesterton has to say and his essays express both better poetry and a better lyric sense than his poems  Almost at once as soon as you begin Lepanto which purports to be a swinging militaristic crusading composition you are expected to pretend that Hurrah Africa and Austria are rhymes You overlook this dullness concerning a detail It is like having a cherry pie set before you and biting into a cherry that hasn t been stoned  But when you proceed only to find that the whole performance has been executed on the supposition that a fine rich sympathetic refrain can be made by pretending to rhyme Hurrah Hispania and Gloria when you perceive that what you thought a solitary error is the plan of the pie and that the human callousness of the maker has permitted him to impose upon you an entire dish of unstoned cherries then you begin to feel that you are and ought to be against the art of Lepanto To place it before you as though it were a species of whole hearted mediaeval treat that is what irritates you most  It is true that the poet says in one of the most attractive poems in this book The Strange Music Though the harp be on my bosom though I finger and I fret  Still my hope is all before me for I cannot play it yet   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The reviewer may be a little unfair for of course the poet does not mean the music of Lepanto which is not in the least strange but all in the key of C and on familiar conceptions  Very lovely and imaginative is the next stanza of The Strange Music  In your strings is hid a music that no hand hath e er let fall In your soul is sealed a pleasure that you have not known at all Pleasure subtle as your spirit strange and slender as your frame Fiercer than the pain that folds you softer than your sorrow s  name  Then soon he praises the strange music so very highly that you begin to be sated with it and then disgusted with it and at last when Time and Life and Death are all worsted by it and the stars stand still to hear your soul s final sense is a craving for some minority report on it  This is the difficulty in reading the works of a determined optimist and booster Maybe the strange music really could achieve all the poet asserts Maybe the authors of some of the railroad advertisements really could guide you to lands of eternal sunshine But the skeptic heart of the truth seeker would have been better persuaded by some more qualified statement by some half tones on the subject and a few of the shades and values of the chromatic scale  The music and the thought of the Poems seem in general to fail of this perception though not in The Three Guilds The Gifts of God and a delightful piece of satire The Shakespeare Memorial  Without questioning the poet s right to his own outlook on the universe and also without intent of irreverence it should   be said that the cosmos of the book seems to be founded on the conception of the supreme deity as one who likes everything the idea of a God who has no taste Surely this is a monotonizing misconception from the outset and a being of universal powers must of necessity possess among them the faculty of self criticism This general observation on the poet s style of thought and expression is commended to the attention of all those who believe the only beauty is light without the presence of shadow and the only piety is optimism  E W  NOTES  Mr William Butler Yeats whose
