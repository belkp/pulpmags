SEPTEMBER 1919  MEMORIES  THE VOICE  ATOMS as old as stars Mutation on mutation Millions and millions of cells Dividing yet still the same From air and changing earth From ancient Eastern rivers From turquoise tropic seas Unto myself I came  My spirit like my flesh Sprang from a thousand sources From cave man hunter and shepherd From Karnak Cyprus Rome The living thoughts in me   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Spring from dead men and women  Forgotten time out of mind  And many as bubbles of foam  Here for a moment s space  Into the light out of darkness  The many in one are mingled  Finding words with my breath  Like a great voice in me  I hear them shout Forever  Seek for Beauty she only  Fights with man against death  THE LONG HILL  1 must have passed the crest a while ago And now I am going down Strange to have crossed the crest and not to know But the brambles were always catching the hem of my gown  All the morning I thought how proud it would be To stand there straight as a queen Wrapped in the wind and the sun with the world under me But the air was dull there was little I could have seen  It was nearly level along the beaten track And the brambles caught in my gown But it s no use now to think of turning back The rest of the way will be only going down   SPRING TORRENTS  Will it always be like this until I am dead Every spring must I bear it all again With the first red haze of the budding maple boughs The first sweet smelling rain  Oh I am like a rock in the rising river Where the flooded water breaks with a low call Like a rock that knows the cry of the waters And can not answer at all  WHAT DO I CARE  What do I care in the dreams and the languor of spring That my songs do not show me at all For they are a fragrance and I am a flint and a fire I am an answer they are only a call  What do I care for love will be over so soon Let my heart have its say and my mind stand idly by For my mind is proud and strong enough to be silent It is my heart that makes my songs not I  MY HEART IS HEAVY  My heart is heavy with many a song Like ripe fruit bearing down the tree And I can never give you one My songs do not belong to me   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Yet in the evening in the dusk When moths go to and fro In the gray hour if the fruit has fallen Take it no one will know  IT IS NOT A WORD  It is not a word spoken Few words are said Nor even a look of the eyes Nor a bend of the head But only a hush of the heart That has too much to keep Only memories waking That sleep so light a sleep  SONG  Let it be forgotten as a flower is forgotten Forgotten as a fire that once was singing gold Let it be forgotten forever and ever Time is a kind friend he will make us old  If anyone asks say it was forgotten Long and long ago As a flower as a fire as a hushed footfall In a long forgotten snow  Sara Teasdale   THE CLOUD DESCENDS  A small water pool at the base of a hill The pool is in the foreground and its waters stretch out of view to left and right Behind them is the hill steeply sloping backward Above the almost fiat topped hill a thin bar of bright blue sky is visible The pool is calm and colored a deep brownish blue Near its centre it bears the bluish white reflection of an irregular oval cloud floating in the sky It is late afternoon and softly bright dwindling light drapes the scene Ten seconds after the curtain rise the Cloud drops waver ingly down from the sky and alights to the extreme left of a narrow slightly curved stretch of ground in front of the pool His image draws near him to the edge of the pool he looks down upon it for several seconds  Cloud Image of me child born of color on water Trailing over the water s breast Like the sigh of a lover paling the breast of his love Sigh making the water white Sigh that I drop from the sky Image of me let us speak The sighs of a lover hold meanings he does not know  Cloud image A voice from the pool Do not call me your sighing I am more than that I am an image of you Straining within the moments of life I hold to catch the shadowed soul Whose first whisper slips into death   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I am a stranger to myself Wakening to moments of pallid longing  Cloud After a pause  Sky is the reflection of some vast far off smile Making a blue breast warmer Sky has a lover who flings her jewels Fierce with the love he cannot bring She strings the jewels over her body Chained lover throwing one vast smile and trinkets That mock the love whipping him I love her too but I cannot look upward So I am happier  Her breath comes down in winds And thrusts me along while I shake Beneath biting hints of her that are like pale whips  A pause  Image of me I have wondered Whether you longed for life To open the closed cries in your shadowed heart As much as I and the unseen lover Long for sky I wondered and so came down T o give you a voice  Cloud image Ashen regrets within me Dwindle to even lighter ashes Ashes that are like dying breath After it passes through fire In my moments of life I fancied myself A wraith like prince standing erect a moment   Between high columns of silence that fell upon him One by one ever rising to fall again But now I know I am only light and color Spotting the dark breasts of this pool With stinted love that cannot form itself  Into a moment of actual touch  I have not even a soul  Cloud Image of me the milky dishevelled shadow Of my own soul drops on you Shadows are often mirrors I see within you parts of myself That were too tenuous to be even haze Parts that I never knew  Cloud image Why do you spin a rustling fairy tale Tender scarves cannot make me proud Cloud You are the milky dishevelled shadow of my soul  Cloud image After a pause  I believe you perhaps because I long to believe  Or because your words are riotously afraid  Cloud After another pause  You have an undertone of red Red like the color left by maiden lips Upon the cheeks of some memory Maiden lips that shrunk to dust And were blown away leaving red that cannot be seen By far away eyes There is no red upon me who gave you this red   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Cloud image I do not know I have often felt it It seemed a word of love Writhing under rancid wraiths that bound it I thought it the answer of this pool Whose love for me was chained because I passed so quickly  Cloud Wisps of caresses only make love bitter and tall Or slay it Red can you speak to me  Voice of the Pool Deeper than the Cloud image s voice and rising from the rear edge of the pool The Cloud starts back as he hears it I am this pool this red is mine Two soldiers splashed into me long ago Red sprang from them in nervous trickles Like hunted passions never dying Yet always seeming to take their last step And on the soldiers faces red and black Were transfigured while wrestling to reach wild eyes The soldiers sank within my edge And knowing they would die  Dragged themselves further in preferring a quicker death The red of them made me feel Like a mother forever holding a child That perished within her spreading over her body Their bones are deep in my heart I cannot feel them Their bodies have faded out to uneasy memories So thin that they can sleep between  Folds of the red I bear   A short interval of silence A Woman slowly walks out upon the narrow stretch of ground in front of the pool She stops two paces away from the Cloud raises an arm as though in weary supplication but checks herself and slowly turns to the pool intently gazing upon it  Woman Cloud image are you a child With moments of awakening sprinkled over endless sleep And do you carry small treasures into your sleep To gladden the sparkling shoulders of dreams I will fling myself into this pool And so become wedded to you and lose The sharp silence flooding my moments of sleep The sharp silence keeping its edge Because an even sharper grief swings it into me  A pause  My husband was a soldier he is dead  Perhaps he lies at the bottom of this pool  That sways him as a tired stranger  Lifts up a body he has found on the road  A body that brings him no grief  Perhaps I shall swerve against him and taste his breast  Without fear before I slip into you Cloud image  Cloud image Why do you seek to join me The life that humans know Is a parade of cloud images Mantled with faintest red Humans are deep pools crossed by cloud figures Who mistake the red cast of the pool   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  For love words too low to be heard And the clouds creeping over the pools are too high to be seen  Woman In a louder voice after a pause She has seated herself with a quick feathery movement beside the pool  If I could only be an actual cloud I would bend like a gracious priest rustling his gown of  pale prayers And shaking his mist ringlets as he marries His images with drifting gestures of death If I could only be a real cloud  The Cloud who has been standing still and watching her suddenly rushes forward and flings himself upon her hiding her from view For several seconds he holds her thus Then he rises lifting her in his arms  Cloud With soft triumph I have often looked down upon this parade Of weary cloud images crossing the depths of humans Who scarcely felt them looked and longed To swoop down closing upon a woman or child And gently spreading her over me  A pause  Am I happier now It does not matter Happiness is the melting clawed ghost of human beings But clouds do not need it  He rises from the ground as the curtain falls Maxwell Bodenheim   MONODIES  MONTEZUMA  As the wind rolls across the flowing treetops so the Delicate haze blue flowing into green rolls Over the violet and brown undulations of these mountains Blue mist flowing into green mist over The violet and brown undulations of the earth Thus  Life flows into Death above Time s translucent contours These mountains are the fingers of a sleeping hand No Jewels adorn its tawny tapering fingers But in the silence It moves forward through the delicate haze  Blue flowing into green while no one watches O you of the blind silent eyes who stand Your feet among the mountains and your head lost Above the heavens translucent as Time s contours And no jewels adorn your forehead nor do your blind eyes Peer toward the Mystery being themselves the Mystery Move you a step nearer in the silence your feet stirring The delicate mist like soft sand  Blue flowing into green while no one watches  WILD HORSES  I am amazed at the joy of the horses They beat on the earth with small round sharp hoofs They cut the face of the earth to wrinkles  And thunder their life and lust in God s face   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  They sweep in a curve like smoke of a prairie fire So they must seem to God who watches Weaving a pattern of grays and browns That shifts and swirls a magian s carpet That flows and swirls like smoke in a crystal  Above the intent face of God who watches  ON THE MESA  This I saw on the mesa s edge As the sun sprang up chanting  A squat girl Naked as the red rock Brow face breasts limbs Square lines in red rock Arms reaching toward the sun From parted lips A silent song veering like a swallow s course flying  This I saw on the mesa s edge As the sun sprang up chanting  But the sun outleapt its ardor dwindled To a cynical blinking yellow eye And she drooped heavily  And I could have fingered her naked flesh As one might touch crumbling stone   A Y Winters  CONCERNING BLAKE  When Blake s mother died He got up out of bed  He was an invalid And closed her eyes and smoothed her hair And took the pillow from beneath her head And drew the sheet across her thin clear face And left her there  The little butler scudded through the gloom A frightened cockroach Blake cornered him To give him orders And he At what time did she  die The last word jerked out With a placating pained grimace Great difficulty His head jerked about Before Blake in the dusk febrile dim Blake s small too fragile body twitched His transparent feminine face Quivered slightly froze back into place His sister s sobs half checked by the gloom Staggered drunken down the hall This was all  Then Blake went back into the twilit room Where the candles struggled vaguely with the dusk He drew back the white sheet from the white face   His bathrobe fell in cerise fold on fold Above it fever blotches on the shadow He was tired and weak and cold  He stared at the clear face as into a mirror His features a curious mirror Death Frosted and uncertain at his sudden intruding breath  THE OLD WEEP GENTLY  These old trees Sigh in every leaf  Look down their trunks As if back down the years Old knots stay Where limbs were torn away Little fist rubbed faces Of gargoyle grief While shadows Slip down the trunks Like tears  LITTLE RABBIT  He said Let the night Sweep down with swirling gestures The nightwind leaps like a flame  And yet The firelight on the wall   A Y Winters  My heart is a cry in the night He said And all the world s a dream  And yet The night sighs above me Like the branches of a tree And it too wears a covering And should it drop that covering Would doubtless rattle A gruesome skeleton  He said You talk of peace where is it The fire there Has no peace Now that choked sobbing Sobs caught low in the throat What does it want  And yet That is a shadowy crying After things long forgot The fire moans to itself And leaps up without impetus And sinks a spectral longing  Or perhaps is it The fluttering of frightened hearts Afraid to go  A Y Winters   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE CONQUEROR  I think the corn will conquer What shall Death s black flail Forever swinging lift and fall Upon these sullen lands That were so marvellously ripe for love  I think the corn will conquer What shall that shrill fury Fear Crazed crazed forever crazed Run screeching down these sober hazel lanes And no one bid her hush  I think the corn will conquer What shall man Forever wailing God and God Beat like a sick child Upon earth s patient breasts  I think the corn will conquer I have seen Green acres marching like the sea Climbing the ridges Riding the hill tops Drawing strength from the warm mist That wraps the valleys   James Rorty  I have seen The red sun lift his battered shield  From out earth s eastern thunders And bask amid the corn tops gold Until the dawn wind trumpets from the height And bids each meadow fling abroad The yellow waving banners of the corn  I have seen Deep in the cool green twilight of the corn A king s sword rusting How the good red earth Had sucked its venom How the sprawling pumpkin wrapped The jewelled scabbard in her lewd embrace The while I heard From every clod from every stalk and blade A myriad insect voices fifing Victory  James Rorty   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WANDERINGS  IN THE MIDDLE WEST  Suggested by an editorial of H M J  This land is a great sea Out of it me And into it at the end  It is my friend My lover and enemy My mother and lover and friend My master and my slave It gave All that I have and it will take away All that I have and even my life some day  The ocean is a friend who for a while Will talk with me and smile But always with a stranger s courtesy  The land is maker and lover and slayer of me  SEA GULLS  I am the white gull overhead To my love I said And stretched my arms and cried With the swift gull s cry   Mary Carolyn Davies  But I shall have no freedom till I die I shall know never lift of sky Or sweep of sea I am chained cruelly by his love of me  THE APPLE TREE SAID  My apples are heavy upon me It was the spring And proud was I of my petals Nor dreamed this thing  That joy could grow to a burden Or beauty could be Changed from snow light to heavy To humble me  I PRAY YOU  The dead make rules and I obey  I too shall be dead some day  Youth and maid who past my death Have within your nostrils breath  I pray you for my own pain s sake Break the rules that I shall make  Mary Carolyn Davies   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A GROUP OF SHORT POEMS  THE BOOKSHOP  Pierrot had grown old He wore spectacles And kept a shop Opium and hellebore He sold Between the covers of books And perfumes distilled from the veins of old ivory And poisons drawn from lotus seeds one hundred years  withered And thinned to the translucence of alabaster He sang a pale song of repeated cadenzas In a voice cold as flutes And shrill as desiccated violins  I stood before the shop Fingering the comfortable vellum of an ancient volume Turning over its leaves And the dead moon looked over my shoulder And fell with a green smoothness upon the page I read I am the Lord thy God thou shalt have none other gods  but me  Through the door came a chuckle of laughter Like the tapping of unstrung kettledrums   For Pierrot has ceased singing for a moment To watch me reading  PEACH COLOR TO A SOAP BUBBLE  A man made a symphony Out of the chords of his soul The notes ran upon the air like flights of chickadees They gathered together and hung As bees above a syringa bush They crowded and clicked upon one another In a flurry of progression And crashed in the simultaneous magnificence Of a grand finale All this he heard But the neighbors heard only the croak Of a wheezy second hand flageolet  Forced to seek another lodging He took refuge under the arch of a bridge For the river below him might be convenient Some day  THE ARTIST  Why do you subdue yourself in golds and purples Why do you dim yourself with folded silks Do you not see that I can buy brocades in any draper s shop And that I am choked in the twilight of all these colors   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  How pale you would be and startling How quiet But your curves would spring upward Like a clear jet of flung water You would quiver like a shot up spray of water You would waver and relapse and tremble And I too should tremble Watching  Murex dyes and tinsel And yet I think I could bear your beauty unshaded  AUTUMN  They brought me a quilled yellow dahlia Opulent flaunting Round gold Flung out of a pale green stalk Round ripe gold Of maturity Meticulously frilled and flaming A fire ball of proclamation Fecundity decked in staring yellow For all the world to see They brought a quilled yellow dahlia To me who am barren Shall I send it to you You who have taken with you All I once possessed   Amy Lowell  BALLS  Throw the blue ball above the little twigs of the tree tops And cast the yellow ball straight at the buzzing stars  All our life is a flinging of colored balls to impossible distances And in the end what have we A tired arm a tip tilted nose  Ah Well Give me the purple one Wouldn t it be a fine thing if I could make it stick  On top of the Methodist steeple  GOOD GRACIOUS  They say there is a fairy in every streak d tulip I have rows and rows of them beside my door Hoop la Come out Brownie And I will give you an emerald ear ring You had better come out For to morrow may be stormy And I could never bring myself to part with my emerald  ear rings Unless there was a moon  Amy Lowell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE DAY OF SUMMER  To Waldo Frank  MORNING  How long ago was it The dawn pleased Homer And Petrarca was it among flowers  Dew full tearful for the love of the dawn That he sang his best song  For Laura  Did the eyes of joy of Prince Paul Fort  See it well once  And was it then that he  Took pleasure in being a Frenchman  In New York These summer days  It s a swollen faced hour Sick with a monstrous cold Gasping with the death of an expectance  Houses there  In a thick row Militarily shut out the sky Another fence In the east  Over this one a shameful blush Strives upward  Nevertheless I go to perform the ceremony Of purification to wash myself    Oh dear water dear dear soap  Because I am poor No ceremony will clean me In this crowded room All the things touch me Soil me T o start a day Feeling dirty Is to go to war Unbelievingly  A little happy pause here For me to think of what I shall be doing in the day  Now has the deep hot belly of the night Given birth to noises The noises pass Over me I lie Insensible Under Work milk bread clothes potatoes potatoes  This is The big Beauty rumbling on Is this The world s Music forevermore   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  This and the irrevocable peddlers Who will come in an hour To hurl loose Pota a a a t o u s yeh p l s waa ry meh 1 n Little apocalyptic faces Faces of the end of all faces Are these the chief musicians Please listen I have a small dear soul and all I want is  a noiseless beauty any little thing I was born for a sylvan century may I claim to be left alone I will not even expect you to understand only   Under this like a cold hating prostitute I lie Insensible And my face is sad because Once There was Ah there was a time  Now go look for the mail Go glean the thoughts they drop before your door You eternal gleaner Love thoughts too  Out in the hall The gas jet Doesn t give a damn that it is day already Stench  Of drenched clothes   Emanuel Carnevali  And snore Of married men Who shall ask the furnished room poets to write A song for the dawn  Oh MAIL  Ah beggars  I am though I refrain from saying it betterthan you in the end I am perfectly honest evidently nothing up my sleeves It is out of my bounteous goodness that I like you a little in spite of  These scanty rights to live A clear day an articulate moment may take them from us So we advance At every chance Our stuttering claim and reference  Dragging my soul along I go to the window The sun fingers reach slowly Over the face of the house in front This is the hour they go to their work Eastward and westward Two processions Silent Shapeless the hats Too large the jackets and shoes Grotesques walking Grotesques for no one to laugh at   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Are they happy perhaps For of course but do they Really know where they re going Has the first of them Found  Down there  Something for his happiness And has he telephoned or telegraphed to the others That they are going Without looking around Without knowing one another ALL TOGETHER Eastward and westward The world has decreed These men go Acknowledged Eastward and westward  Sit down and take the rest of your life O poets  All my days Are in this room Pressing close against me I know what I have done misdone mistaken misunderstood  forgotten overlooked And I have lost my youth   Emanuel Carnevali  Everybody knows me No one wonders at me They have placed me in their minds made me small and  tied me up T o throw me in a little dusty corner of their minds All my days are huddled Close against me My youth is but a regret and a madness A madness Jesus Christ I am not old yet never  mind what I have told you what I have been I have not irremediably committed myself I am not lost For pity s sake Let me go Let me go free For pity s sake Let me go With my youth  Ah the old days are huddled So close against my chest That no great freeing gesture Is possible  After the tears Cool new sensitive Under my body hushed and stiff I open the door Quietly   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I close the door behind me Carefully  The street s greeting  I m out of work  Damn work to work and come home in the evening hungry for all the things that could have been done instead  But to go Unemployed Without hunger At all  Oh listen O Street Let your word to me be a delicate whisper I am young Nice day I look Straight ahead Staccato steps Stiff and cool I walk Sweet morning soeur de charité  It is the light mood in the streets of the morning Bouncing on the roofs kicked By the rosy foot of the wind Ah we ah we are chained to the sidewalk but we hold  our eyes upward   Emanuel Carnevali  Lightly lightly Do blow away the dust of our dead And save us all from them who are smouldering inside our  houses See the fine dust from those windows see the dust angry at the sun Who threw these kids here among us them and their fun and war GIMME GIMME King of the triumphing mood the iceman cracks easy puns with a landlady of the dust Kaiser of the lightness of the morning the policeman swinging his stick writes sacred hieroglyphs  Furtively I steal From what and whom I know A little youth For myself I know nothing I forget nothing I m glad enough to live In the morning  NOON  You say yes And you feed it in your temples that entity you are so divinely mysteriously sure of and you call it LIFE You say no   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  In the saloon the wooden yellow temple You grunt no and you poison that which you call LIFE It s noon the whistles rattle and shriek city Parcae I come too It s noon I am coming with you in your temples You say yes And you grunt NO But your faces are faces of rancor Rancor against Those who won t let you  Hurl loose your soul you think you bad philosophers Which you must steadily Throttle within you Imbecility is an immense maw and at noon It is hungry with a thousand crawling hungers So that happy bewildered imbecile of a sun Looks bewildered at me Wondering that I am so utterly disgusted  Not so Not so disgusted after all O altars of a little comfort altars of a dyspeptic god gone  crazy in America for lack of personality hamburger steak Irish stew goulash spaghetti chop suey and curry O lunch room counters  O tripods of a little secure religion tripods of a little secure beauty O kitchen fires O bedraggled romances O alcoholic ladies in crimson and green mists O women so cheap and ingratiating O sacri   fices for you ladies of all the flesh and all the brains O saloons  My malediction on the cowards who are afraid of the word the word is a kind sweet child a kind sweet child Malediction on the sacrifices of the dumb and deaf  Hesitating everywhere hesitating fearfully The few poets they who weigh with delicate hands Walk in the unfrequented roads Maundering Crying and laughing Against the rest  AFTERNOON  Over our shoulders Your noisy anger O Elevated I walk in a fog of sleep Not fearing to be awakened any more Something queer to drink Or going somewhere else Another girl These are the last visions of salvation The dust has blinded The trees in the park  The gutters are loose mouths of the drunken Manhattan Now at last give them up your hungry and greasy   And greedy romances  And you snobs damn fools remember you are sweating too Now at last be all appeased In ugliness  Wallow in the heat O sacred soul of the crowd No one dies don t be Afraid Some life is left See the will o the wisps of lewdness Burning in all the eyes We are alive yet  See me scuttle on Satisfied enough Finding with my almost eager eyes Not yet known breasts and strange thighs In your sacred crowds O Manhattan  EVENING  Tender and young again feminine sky of the evening of summer is blushing Round long and soft like a draped arm sky of the evening  over the poor city resting Spaces of cool blue are musing They will hold all our sadness O spaces of cool blue  O city there lived in you once O Manhattan a man WALT WHITMAN   Emanuel Carnevali  Our hands are wasted already perhaps but enough for con  tribution to Beauty Enough for a great sadness will be Evening of summer evening of summer going to sleep Over the purple bed over the light flowers of the sunset Many other evenings have I in my heart I have loved so  much so long and so well don t you remember cool blue  spaces brooding I shall recall you I shall recall you if insanity comes and sits down and puts  her hands in my hair  Once I touched things with religion once a girl loved me once I used to go hiking with young folks over the Palisades  Once I cried worthily  NIGHT  Take me all Woman whom I know so well every wrinkle of you my  room We won t fight any more I have been around and I have seen the wisdom of you In the city Lay me down over the torn bedspread let the bed bugs keep  me company Don t be a prude old lady Your wounds are disgusting enough But in the city only the syphilis blooms And all the other   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Flowers are dead I will let you reach out with your smell into me Literature eh Blossoms of beggary morning breath of the sick dreams of  the dead And I Devising sun spangling images at night on your  table With the urge from the soiled linen box Tonight the lie got drunk with sarcasm And croaked Having found nowhere in the city Self assertion Put me to sleep Knock me to sleep Or keep me awake and keep a gnaw in my heart working If so you please  Outside a greasy moon Refuses to understand How ridiculous her unesthetic weeping is  If I kill myself She may If I kill myself He may Would they  What would you want O Death Face of character   Emanuel Carnevali  With a faceless man like me Without you Death  I am dead  So I m going out There must be a comfortable little place For me in the world Now I m dead enough I picked it out reading the Evening Journal Sermon on  Success  To hell with books I ll give my young body a chance Before my head gets bald  I will walk with the marionettes  Now I m dislocated enough and my mouth is clogged  I ll go talk to them  Now I m dumb enough  But come and see me  Oh do come and see me  Look down upon me from your place in the sky  O MY HIGH DREAM  I have a brain for everything  I shall dance their ragtime  Will someone whisper sometime  There is a man who dances  With a strange embarrassment  Emanuel Carnevali  POETRY A Magazine of Verse COMMENT  BACK TO NATURE  IT is only in midsummer that we degenerate occupants of clothes and houses may return to the original source of all life and art and our vacations are fortunate in the direct proportion of our withdrawal to that wilderness from which we sprang The High Sierras are best that tramping among remote and lofty mountains where white granite props the sky and cataracts a thousand feet high stand like nude gods against the cliffs where the rivers race foaming through V shaped valleys watering here and there little lost gardens full of blue eyed flowers The Sierras are best because Mother Earth has played the whole scale there from tenderness to grandeur and because man as yet has left no trace upon her  Or for more austere and strange if less companionable beauty he who explores our desert lands in the sun searched Southwest is fortunate Stark sublimity of a gashed and ravaged world turned to unspeakable glory by color magic the body and soul of little man are swept into great spaces of freedom by contacts such as these And among them he may find primitive life practicing primitive art in tribal islands surviving out of the past  And there are countless lesser wildernesses in our less dramatic but infinitely various Middle West of the Missisi sippi River and the great and little lakes of vast corn laden prairies and wooded hills and wide flung waters sparkling in   the sun Many little wildernesses there are in every state of this continental country places impenetrable to the slaves of civilization but open to all who have kept their freedom  In one of them an island in a little lake surrounded by woods or sandy slopes my friend and I were affronting nature with a discussion of art She set forth the natal severity of Greek myths the austerity of Greek art in those Homeric Aeschylean ages when it was fresh from the gods Yes I reflected but for us is not Greek art a poisoned well its living waters contaminated by the dipping of impure cups through the long procession of the Renaissance trailing off even today into Georgian odes and Ionic colonnaded office buildings Is it still possible for us to clarify that spring and tear away the clutter of votive offerings memorials of mistaken taste which have gathered there through many centuries  Will not the spiritual renewal of the race especially of this rainbow hearted race of ours which is forming out of the union of many strains will not that spiritual renewal of the race out of which great art must spring come rather through a more direct appeal to more original sources through the immediate contact of our people with nature in her sacred and intimate reserves And will not the new art take its hint from aboriginal art perhaps the art of the Aztecs and the pueblos rather than from derivations of pseudo classic derivations long separated from their primitive Greek source  In the love of our people for Nature lies the highest   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  hope of the race Out of this will develop we may hope spiritual freedom and an indigenous and self expressive art It may be that the movement for national and state and municipal parks for the reservation of wildernesses little and great to the use of the people forever is the most important the most deeply impassioned spiritual and aesthetic enterprise of our time H M  A NOTE ON PRIMITIVE POETRY  The first striving toward poetry in the Occident was in the form of narratives sung or chanted by old men in praise or condemnation of kings or warriors and it became the gilded and softened history of a people told to awaken love and pride in their hearts Gradually it spread to narratives of all forms to allegories written in praise of the morals of Christianity to dainty love episodes recounted in songs by the troubadours and to satirical narratives such as Chaucer s dealing with the frailties of common people Maxwell Bodenheim in the New Republic  So writes an exponent of modern verse whose poetic tradition it is easy to see goes no farther back than the Homeric era For the first striving toward poetry whether in the Occident or the Orient was and is a far different thing It is not impossible to know what preceded Homer it is not impossible to learn at first hand that symbolism has always preceded legend or narrative and to make this discovery one need not project oneself imaginatively backward through time or immure oneself in a library one need merely project oneself physically on a two or three days journey from any of the principal cities of the United States and witness a dance drama of the south western Indians in order to discover at first hand what primitive poetry is like   A Note on Primitive Poetry  It is not story telling poetry It is not poetry designed to please It is designed to accomplish something All symbols in the first place are of this kind The poetic symbol is invocative it is in a sense a prayer whether consciously or unconsciously used as such whether consciously as in the dances a prayer for rain for good hunting for food clothes and protection against enemies prime considerations in our own world today or unconsciously as in the love songs or lullabies prayers for requited love or for long life and happiness for one s own  In the beginning therefore primitive poetry is brief staccato ejaculatory like a cry or a wish or an aspiration sometimes a mere mood of longing or an observation whose deeper significance is felt by the singer and hearer It is usually a single image simple or complex and the variations are in the nature of amplifications of this image through re statement with slight changes or through reiteration As the song progresses in the dance action accompanies this image which seems to grow and expand with a life of its own to be in short a symbol capable of creatively projecting that which it symbolizes  From being but a cry of desire or a crystallized wish the song in the symbolic dance becomes ceremonial and allies itself to the equally symbolic action of the dancers as in the Navajo Mountain Chant a succession of images developing with the action both poetry and action being co expressive but not as in modern theatric art co illustrative which means that either one or the other could be dispensed with   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  There lie the black mountains There lie the black sticks There lie my sacrifices  There lie the blue mountains There lie the blue sticks There lie my sacrifices  Or this from the same source  Where the sun rises The Holy Young Man The great plumed arrow Has swallowed And withdrawn it  Where the sun sets The Holy Young Woman The cliff rose arrow Has swallowed And withdrawn it The moon is satisfied  Nor has Indian poetry ever the emptiness of the merely decorative motive it is sufficiently decorative indeed but always the image has been born of the emotion and so has not the still born aspect of the purely decorative word painting which exists only for and of itself and has no future  As my eyes Search the prairie I feel the summer in the spring  could never have been born save of longing and sheer sensitiveness to nature the responsive quiver of a man s being to the quiver of nature itself Is not this intimacy lacking in much modern poetry which feels itself to be so largely beyond nature even as much modern art also has divorced itself from nature and is proud of the fact  Indian poetry is very honest It does not belong to the   A Note on Primitive Poetry  romantic school It is almost literally real It accepts life as a whole and puts the most concrete commonplace things on the same footing as things of the most spiritual and delicate values And it must not be supposed that Indian song can not encompass the latter  The Chippewas having salt make a song of it And a Tlingit is able to express very subtle things through concrete means  About himself that thought he had died the man thus dreams To my home I ve got at last is how I always feel  And a Pawnee warrior sings in battle  Let us see is it real Let us see is it real Let us see is it real This life we are living  It is easy to see why Indian poetry has a tribal value and significance why it counts with the tribe as it does not count with us it has the magic power of projecting physical and spiritual results even material results If it has not this same power with us today it is only because we do not realize it Of course this is most obviously true of the poems sung in the green corn dance to make the corn grow or in the hunting dances performed to attract the game but it is equally true one may say of the genesis of all Indian poetry  Indian poetry is not for an instant regarded as an escape from life or a sedative indeed one would think that this idea should have been discarded with the nineties The notion is so far removed from the Indian s conception of art that I doubt if he could have any understanding of it   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Instead poetry is regarded by the Indian as a heightening an intensifying of life  Poetry as a criticism of life equally does not and can not exist for the Indian because poetry and life are not divided Poetry is life and the only way one can know life is through poetry and the dance it is through these that one approaches the sources of life and that is why poetry has for the Indian the complete fulness of life and never the empty hollowness of the merely decorative phrase As a symbol it fulfils itself  It is true that to understand much Indian poetry one must know something of Indian life and psychology just as one must know something of Japanese life and psychology to appreciate the finer shades of the Japanese Noh But there are many Indian songs which need no special interpretation they speak the universal language of poetry the love of nature sorrow of parting love friendship war eternal themes  Primitive poetry however crude is almost always art because it has not been made to please the public but the poet It is not communicative art and that it is understood by another is simply due to the fact that we possess emotions and instincts in common The song is for him who feels it Art as communication art as addressed to an audience belongs to a later period The fine thing about Indian poetry and about Indian art including the beautifully symbolic dance dramas is that it is not addressed to any audience save that in the sky it is a magic projection of the self that is beyond self created out of distress longing or   A Note on Primitive Poetry  truly aesthetic aspiration and it is out of this primitive groping toward art through primitive graphic symbols of art and of song that language and thought itself evolved  If we would wish to know anything then about the genesis of poetry or art it is thoroughly essential that we should go back to the beginnings so far as these beginnings are available to us and not take Homer as a starting point Incidentally the savage peoples as we call them are far less crude than we imagine far less unsophisticated They have refinements that we have forgotten And they are a repository of our most basic meanings A C H  REVIEWS  IN THE OLD FASHION  Motley and other Poems by Walter de la Mare Henry  Holt amp Co  One is a bit over informed of magic in opening a book by Mr de la Mare The critics far and wide have accepted the hint with gratitude and the familiar word confronts one on the slip cover Like other re asserted opinions it becomes a challenge one searches the book for proof of the claim There is magic in certain lyrics by this poet The Listeners and the beautiful lady song have surprises in their pattern like waves that break into foam and a few of the child poems are almost as exquisitely naive as Hilda Conkling s But Mr de la Mare s style is as fragile as it is delicate and in working out his effects he is impeded by inherited formulae   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Rarely does he free his art of a poor tradition many of his poems are at best rococo vases of an eighteenth century artificiality insisted on in our strenuous age though thrones go toppling down  I speak of such poems as The Tryst The Riddlers The Blind Boy The Stranger Motley indeed almost everything in this book in which a theme of Nothing at all or The Aforesaid is set forth with all the old convolutions of diction and phrasing which poets of modern feeling have discarded I sometimes wonder whether for some of Mr de la Mare s admirers his magic consists in his flourish of clichés the tinkle of old familiar phrases which sound sweet to their ears now that few poets indulge them o er mid bloweth perchance fare to watch and ward daisied sward golden shoon melancholic nightingale grief smote my heart soft did look the nightingale these are but a few of the clichés and mannerisms to be found in two brief poems chosen by chance The Sunken Garden and The Riddlers Indeed the magic must be largely in these somewhat frayed and faded details of pattern for if one cuts them out of most of the poems in this book there is little left of warp or woof  Mr de la Mare s reputation as a lyric poet of delicate quality should not shield him from a reminder that this kind of thing is out of date Admitting that it has a certain charm of quaintness like the black walnut furniture of fifty years ago it belongs even as that product of a machine mad age to a period of false design when furbelows of ornament were set on for their own sake and not to fulfil any   In the Old Fashion  demand inherent in the structure Mr de la Mare s poems are much too be furbelowed His exceptional instinct for delicate nuances of rhythm and few poets can vary the beat so ingeniously as he gets lost among coloratura niceties His artistic sincerity is tangled up in archaic affectations and only when he cuts free of them does his truly lyric voice have a chance to function at its best  A careful reading of this book reveals nothing of this absolute best nothing to be set beside the two poems referred to above But five or six songs have something of their quality and they carry it with a simplicity not to be found in the rest of the book Of these are The Little Salamander  Empty House Music The Unchanging Vigil and this poignant one The Remonstrance  I was at peace until you came And set a careless mind aflame I lived in quiet cold content All longing in safe banishment Until your ghostly lips and eyes  Made wisdom unwise Naught was in me to tempt your feet To seek a lodging Quite forgot Lay the sweet solitude we two In childhood used to wander through Time s cold had closed my heart about  And shut you out Well and what then O vision grave Take all the little all I have Strip me of what in voiceless thought Life s kept of life unhoped unsought Reverie and dream that memory must  Hide deep in dust This only I say Though cold and bare The haunted house you have chosen to share   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Still neath its walls the moonbeam goes And trembles on the untended rose Still o er its broken roof tree rise The starry arches of the skies And neath your lightest word shall be The thunder of an ebbing sea  It is a book of personal emotion but veiled in a thin and pale old fabric alluringly soft to touch and sight Mostly the reminiscent themes are set forth in reminiscent designs of faded color and under the mesh hides a shy and wistful but shadowed and prisoned soul Mr de la Mare can t make out the age he lives in indeed he gives it up without trying as he flutes his reed at the edge of the stream  H M  SOLDIER AND LOVER  War and Love by Richard Aldington Four Seas Co  This book was written so the author says less for myself and others who are interested in subtleties and more for the kind of men I lived with in the camp and in the line and the book is convincing proof that a deliberate assumption of an alien point of view destroys all that is most valuable most poignant in a poet s genius Aldington is not cannot be of the rank and file For him life has delicate meanings exquisite pleasures poignancies of feeling He assumes that these are incomprehensible to his comrades and seeks to represent the inarticulate feelings of the ordinary civilized man thrust suddenly into these extraordinary and hellish circumstances In so doing he fails both ways he does not make great poetry and he fails of being understood by   the audience for which he is writing In his own words That they did not understand very much is a matter for cheerful acceptance  A soldier writing to this magazine of Aldington s Choricos a poem on death written at about eighteen spoke of reading it to soldiers of the line and of hearing it recited in a dugout by another soldier when they were under heavy shell fire and in the imminent presence of death With all its idealism it was for them a poignant and beautiful challenge to the spirit Though written before the war and without thought of Tommy Atkins as an audience it succeeds where this book by a common soldier for common soldiers cannot touch them at any point The clearest cry of the spirit reaches ears we imagine to be deaf But the war poems in this book are only bitter muffled plaints of rebellion  Here is part of one of the best of them Bondage  I have been a spendthrift Dropping from lazy fingers Quiet colored hours Fluttering away from me Like oak and beech leaves in October  I have lived keenly and wastefully Like a bush or a sun insect Lived sensually and thoughtfully Loving the flesh and beauty of this world Green ivy about ruined towers The outpouring of the grey sea And the ecstasy Of a pale clear sky at sunset  I long vainly for solitude And the lapse of silent hours I am frantic to throw off   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  My heavy cloth and leather garments To set free my feet and body And I am so far from beauty That a yellow daisy seems to clutch my heart With eager searching petals And I am grateful to humility For the taste of pure clean bread  In the second part Love the poet has grown more sensual less idealistic than in Images yet one cannot say that his art has lessened He brings to this experience a spirit so hungry for beauty that it cannot be fed enough the only peace he conceives is death in the arms of the beloved It is of the flesh yet delicate rare torturingly beautiful Into physical love he pours all the pent up streams of emotion that once found their way toward other manifestations of earth for now his spirit is too languid too numb with suffering to respond to earth beauty The spiritual experience of war has for him been overshadowed by the shrinking of his body from dirt evil smells vermin cold fatigue I quote a few fragments of poems as the best ones are too long to print in their entirety  Everlasting as the sea round the islands I cry at your door for love more love Everlasting as the roll of the sea My blood beats always for you for you Everlasting as the unchangeable sea I cry the infinite for space to love you  I am insatiate desperate Death if need be or you near me Loving me beautifully piercing me to life But not this not this bitterness this grief This long torture of absence   She has but to turn her head And lay her lips to mine For all my blood to throb tumultuously She is so shudderingly beautiful  Perhaps it is more profitable for a poet to suffer in the spirit than in the body Aldington s genius could not use the crude painful and bitter experience he was made to undergo Not many poets have been able to mould into beauty such material The ones who succeed best are those more robust coarse fibered those who meet the challenge and ignore perhaps scarcely feel the filth They are poets of a different order from Aldington  Marjorie Allen Seiffert  AN IRISH HARP  Songs of the Celtic Past by Norreys Jephson O Conor  John Lane Co  The title of Mr O Conor s book is somewhat misleading for one would think of it as an anthology instead of a collection of original poems Mr O Conor is an American of Irish descent for whom the Celtic past is very much of  the present and indeed there is no reason why it should be any less so than the Greek past Should I dare to say that I got more pleasure from reading Mrs Hutton s The Tain than from Homer Well I did and incidentally that is a book which I think has never had its due meed of appreciation As far as I can see there seems to be a conspiracy of silence about it even among the Irish literary men themselves Written in verse it is far more easy to    read than Lady Gregory s prose versions of the Irish legends  and its arrangement is dramatic it holds the interest to  the end  This is hardly a divergence from the subject of Mr O Conor s poems since they belong to the same world In this book he re tells the story of Ailill and Etain and makes a mystery play called Cormac s Christmas of another old legend In this he has captured the simplicity and charm of the early mystery form very successfully A Masque of Flowers is the third long poem in the book and these longer contributions are interspersed with lyrics many of which have the exact quality of old Irish poems for instance The Song of Angus and Caer or In the Monastery or The Monk Pauses in His Labor These are as fine as anything in the volume A C H  CAMMAERTS AGAIN  Messines et Autres Poèmes by Emile Cammaerts John  Lane London  We are glad to welcome another book by Emile Cammaerts whose previous work we reviewed in September 1917 The dedication bearing the title of L Aïeule is a touching commentary on old age But these poems are almost all about the war Whether a soldier speaks or a flower or a bird we always hear the war thought Messines the title piece is less fine I think than some of the other work Les Jacinthes is an exquisite lyric There is a lofty epitaph on a young soldier killed before Dixmude The   same poetic quality which distinguished Chants Patriotiques et Autres Poèmes is sustained in this new volume I feared that I might not find here the equals of L Amour de la Patrie and Frère Jacques but Verdun is a spirited thing and its martial refrain Verdun tient toujours conveys a real thrill  In Dans les Cotswolds the author has achieved lyrically and potently an utterance of the sense of time s vastness and earth s eternity and also of their superb insolence and unconsciousness in the overwhelming calm of a spring day This same sense of time s immense unity is evident in the fine poem called Le Dernier Croisé which was written at Easter time in 1916 after the first battle of Gaza Tommy in his khaki watches at the base of Calvary The breeze is blowing from Syria How long is it since they laid Him there How long is it since they sealed the tomb Here are fragments of it  Qu attend il brun dans la nuit brune Sous la brise syrienne Qu atterid il au pied de la croix Sous le croissant de la lune Est ce que ses frères reviennent Richard Robert Louis et Godefroid  Tommy écoute une cloche qui tinte Tinte tinte dans son village C est Pâques ici et Pâques là bas La lune soudain s est éteinte Derrière un nuage Depuis combien de temps L ont ils enfermé là Dites Richard Robert Louis et Godefroid La nuit se passe et l aube pointe Les merles sifflent dans les haies d Elstree   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Tommy veille Tommy rêve Tommy prie  La brise souffle de Syrie  Very beautiful is a Berceuse de Guerre wherein a mother  sings to her child while her heart voices a song for her  husband far away at war an old story but worked out  with strong originality John Carpenter has brought out  the full beauty of this poem in a wonderful musical setting  Th e arrangement of the book with its English title page  and explanations is too suggestive of a language text book  Agnes Lee Freer CORRESPONDENCE  CONCERNING HILDA CONKLING  The following letters ask and answer a number of ques  tions which have been received at this office  Dear POETRY Could you not give your readers more explicit information as to just how those poems of Hilda Conkling s are done To what extent does her mother select rearrange and give form Is it all actually improvised as given Then I must make a pilgrimage to Hilda and kiss her little hands What a delightful little genius For You Mother and The Dew light are quite without qualification among the very best things in the July number which is one of the most notable I have seen Such queer little flashes of imagination With a curl of cloud and a feather of blue The white bunnies beg hirn for dew It is time for summer when the birds come back to pick up their lonesome songs and many others E Sapir  Dear Miss Monroe I do not change words in Hilda s poems nor alter her word order I write down the lines as rhythm dictates She has made many poems which I have had to lose because I could not be certain of accurate transcription I make notes on those I keep to be sure I have them as she says them I   Concerning Hilda Conkling  never tell her about this but she does know that I like her to do it Recently she made a song and then said Forget that one Mother it s too rhymish She says she likes to talk her thoughts to me and this is as good a description as I can think of if you ask me How does Hilda do it I do not read much verse to Hilda because I do not like to have her try to imitate it She loves to have verse read which she cannot wholly understand and is most fond of the odes of John Keats and Swinburne s chorus from Atalanta beginning When the hounds of Spring are on Winter s traces which she loves for the sound of it for some of the nature detail and for the presence of the great god Pan  Grace Hazard Conkling  Dear POETRY I have asked Mrs Conkling to let me answer Mr Sapir s questions about Hilda because I have seen her making poems all her short life Hilda is the clearest case of inspiration I have ever known She will be nine years old in October and a form of chant to an imaginary comrade she called Mary Cobweb was her earliest expression A bit of mosquito netting thrown over her head the fur collar of a visitor about her throat any little change of dress or ornament creates a new world for her a complete world full of detail and she used to tell Mary Cobweb about it in a song Then she learned that her mother was pleased with the songs and now the poem has become a gift I have a poem for you Mother is the phrase she uses frequently offering a choice You may have this one or this one Her mother chooses one and usually manages to get the others Sometimes Hilda will make four or five songs at once and then there will be intervals when she will not make any for several weeks Mrs Conkling never changes the poems  Hilda still has certain baby errors in speech faint away for fade away and some others but she has a natural interest in words and often uses rather striking expressions as when she recently spoke of a woman with a slipping memory  An interesting phase of her creative mind is its independence of external suggestion The cottage where we have been staying is on a hilltop in open country and Hilda was fascinated by what she called the orange lilies that grew near One evening she said I have made a poem today it s about flowers I rather expected to hear of orange lilies but she said The Land of Poppies is back of the silver leaf This poem was not finished There were babies in the Land of Poppies but no birds When   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  we asked why there were no birds she said They are afraid of going to sleep and not waking up the babies don t know enough to be afraid She is always sure of the detail  In reading Hilda s poems it must be remembered that she has been very carefully taught She knows the Greek gods and the heroes of mythology as well as she does her dolls and her playmates She is familiar with good music She knows a good deal of good poetry She has never heard anything else We were speaking of daffodils a few days ago and Hilda knew what Shakespeare Dryden and Wordsworth had said about them When she tells us what she sees and hears in her world of dreams she has the advantage of knowing only good English to use It is as natural for Hilda to speak of Narcissus as for some other children of the outrages in the funny sheet of a contemporary newspaper She does not know that her poems are being printed and so far she is free from self consciousness about them She is a normal little girl very pretty with a great quantity of fair hair and rather odd blue eyes almond eyes with the points coming well out to the temples a quick graceful affectionate child with a sure instinct for beauty and an amazing creative imagination I hope she may never lose her sense of intimate relation with the universe  Louise Driscoll  A POETS HANDBOOK  Dear POETRY There is a crying need for a Poets Handbook of Science W R Benêt for instance should be informed that bats do not hang in barns at night that they fly around at night and hang there in the day time Lola Ridge that palms do not grow on mesas that jaguars do not inhabit deserts etc etc I pause only because I have not now the time or energy to write the book I strongly suspect that the time so spent would be of greater service to the muse than the perpetration of masterpieces  A Y Winters  Our Motto  OUR MOTTO  To have great poets there must be great audiences too  If I desired great audiences I should make myself a brother to the scissors grinder Or provide myself with a solder iron and cob And my auditorium would be as wide as the country And as high as the sky My songs would be for children who have time to listen Or men grown old and deaf Or maybe I should sing to a passing cloud Or the dusty road or the rain  And if I wished to be a poet I should get myself a little piece of ground And raise trees and flowers and berries And read my poems to the birds that stole my cherries And perhaps I should find a maid Who would listen lovingly to my songs And then I should truly be great And I should have great audiences too  Raymond P Fischer  NOTES  Sara Teasdale Mrs Ernst Filsinger who now lives in New
