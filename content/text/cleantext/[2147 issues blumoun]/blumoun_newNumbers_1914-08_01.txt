CRYPT HOUSE PRESS.GLOUCESTER. A Quarterly Publication of the Poems of Rupert BrookeJohn DrinkwaterWilfrid Wilson GibsonLascelles Abercrombie TIARE TAHITI Rupert Brooke Maxima, when our laughter ends,And hearts and bodies, brown as white,Are dust about the doors of friends,Or scent ablowing down the night,Then, oh ! then, the wise agree,Conies our immortality.Mamua, there waits a landHard for us to understand.Out of time, beyond the sun,All are one in Paradise,You and Pupure are one,And Taii, and the ungainly wise.There the Eternals are, and thereThe Good, the Lovely, and the True,And Types, whose earthly copies wereThe foolish broken things we knew;There is the Face, whose ghosts we are;The real, the never-setting Star;And the Flower, of which we loveFaint and fading shadows here;Never a tear, but only Grief;Dance, but not the limbs that move.Songs in Song shall disappear;Instead of lovers, Love shall be;For hearts, Immutability;And there, on the Ideal Reef,Thunders the Everlasting Sea!And my laughter, and my pain,Shall home to the Eternal Brain.And all lovely things, they say, Meet in liveliness again;Miri's laugh, Te'ipo's feet,And the hands of Matua,Stars and sunlight there shall meet,Coral's hues and rainbows there,And Teiira's braided hair;And with the starred tiare's white,And white birds in the dark ravine,And flamboyants ablaze at night,And jewels, and evening's after-green,And dawns of pearl and gold and red,Mamua, your lovelier head !And there'll no more be one who dreamsUnder the ferns, of crumbling stuff,Eyes of illusion, mouth that seems,All time-entangled human love.And you'll no longer swing and swayDivinely down the scented shade,Where feet to Ambulation fade,And moons are lost in endless Day.How shall we wind these wreaths of ours,Where there are neither heads nor flowers ?Oh, Heaven's Heaven !—but we'll be missingThe palms, and sunlight, and the south;And there's an end, I think, of kissing,When our mouths are one with Mouth . . .Tau here, Mamua,Crown the hair, and come away!Hear the calling of the moon,And the whispering scents that stray About the idle warm lagoon.Hasten, hand in human hand,Down the dark, the flowered way,Along the whiteness of the sand,And in the water's soft caress,Wash the mind of foolishness,Mamua, until the day.Spend the glittering moonlight therePursuing down the soundless deepIyimbs that gleam and shadowy hair,Or floating lazy, half-asleep.Dive and double and follow after,Snare in flowers, and kiss, and call,With lips that fade, and human laughter,And faces individual,Well this side of Paradise ! There's little comfort in the wise.Papeete, February, 1914. RETROSPECT Rupert Brooke In your arms was still delight,Quiet as a street at night;And thoughts of you, I do remember,Were green leaves in a darkened chamber,Were dark clouds in a moonless sky.Love, in you, went passing by,Penetrative, remote, and rare,Like a bird in the wide air,And, as the bird, it left no traceIn the heaven of your face.In your stupidity I foundThe sweet hush after a sweet sound.All about you was the lightThat dims the greying end of night;Desire was the unrisen sun,Joy the day not yet begun,With tree whispering to tree,Without wind, quietly.Wisdom slept within your hair,And Long-Suffering was there,And, in the flowing of your dress,Undiscerning Tenderness.And when you thought, it seemed to me,Infinitely, and like a sea,About the slight world you had knownYour vast unconsciousness was thrown. .O haven without wave or tide!Silence, in which all songs have died!Holy book, where hearts are still!And home at length under the hill! O mother quiet, breasts of peace,Where love itself would faint and cease !0 infinite deep I never knew,1 would come back, come back to you,Find you, as a pool unstirred,Kneel down by you, and never a word,Lay my head, and nothing said,In your hands, ungarlanded ;And a long watch you would keep;And I should sleep, and I should sleep !Mataiea, January, 1914 THE GREAT LOVER I have been so great a lover : filled my daysSo proudly with the splendour of Love's praise,The pain, the calm, and the astonishment,Desire illimitable, and still content,And all dear names men use, to cheat despair,For the perplexed and viewless streams that bearOur hearts at random down the dark of life.Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strifeSteals down, I would cheat drowsy Death so far,My night shall be remembered for a starThat outshone all the suns of all men's days.Shall I not crown them with immortal praiseWhom I have loved, who have given me, dared with meHigh secrets, and in darkness knelt to seeThe inenarrable godhead of delight ?Love is a flame;—we have beaconed the world's night.A city:—and we have built it, these and I.An emperor:—we have taught the world to die.So, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence,And the high cause of love's magnificence,And to keep loyalties young, I'll write those namesGolden for ever, eagles, crying flames,And set them as a banner, that men may know,To dare the generations, burn, and blowOut on the wind of Time, shining and streaming ....These I have loved:White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,Ringed with blue lines ; and feathery, faery dust;Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the strong crustOf friendly bread; and many-tasting food; Rainbows ; and the blue bitter smoke of wood ;And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;And flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon ;Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soonSmooth away trouble ; and the rough male kissOf blankets ; grainy wood ; live hair that isShining and free ; blue-massing clouds ; the keenUnpassioned beauty of a great machine;The benison of hot water; furs to touch ;The good smell of old clothes ; and other such,The comfortable smell of friendly fingers,Hair's fragrance, and the musty reek that lingersAbout dead leaves and last year's ferns . . .Dear names,And thousand other throng to me ! Royal flames ;Sweet water's dimpling laugh from tap or spring;Holes in the ground ; and voices that do sing ;Voices in laughter, too; and body's pain,Soon turned to peace; and the deep-panting train;Firm sands; the little dulling edge of foamThat browns and dwindles as the wave goes home;And washen stones, gay for an hour; the coldGraveness of iron ; moist black earthen mould ;Sleep ; and high places ; footprints in the dew ;And oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new;And new-pealed sticks ; and shining pools on grass;—All these have been my loves. And these shall pass,Whatever passes not, in the great hour,Nor all my passion, all my prayers, have powerTo hold them with me through the gate of Death. They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor breath,Break the high bond we made, and sell Love's trustAnd sacramented covenant to the dust.Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake,And give what's left of love again, and makeNew friends, now strangers ....But the best I've known,Stays here, and changes, breaks, grows old, is blownAbout the winds of the world, and fades from brainsOf living men, and dies.Nothing remains.O dear my loves, O faithless, once againThis one last gift I give : that after menShall know, and later lovers, far-removed,Praise you, " All these were lovely " ; say, "He loved."Mataiea, 1914. WAIKIKI Warm perfumes like a breath from vine and treeDrift down the darkness. Plangent, hidden from eyes,Somewhere an eukaleli thrills and criesAnd stabs with pain the night's brown savagery.And dark scents whisper; and dim waves creep to me,Gleam like a woman's hair, stretch out, and rise;And new stars burn into the ancient skies,Over the murmurous soft Hawaian sea.And I recall, lose, grasp, forget again,And still remember, a tale I have heard, or known,An empty tale, of idleness and pain,Of two that loved—or did not love—and oneWhose perplexed heart did evil, foolishly,A long while since, and by some other sea.Waikiki, 1913. HAUNTINGS In the grey tumult of these after yearsOft silence falls ; the incessant wranglers part ;And less-than-echoes of remembered tearsHush all the loud confusion of the heart;And a shade, through the toss'd ranks of mirth and crying,Hungers, and pains, and each dull passionate mood,—Quite lost, and all but all forgot, undying,Comes back the ecstasy of your quietude.So a poor ghost, beside his misty streams,Is haunted by strange doubts, evasive dreams,Hints of a pre-Lethean life, of men,Stars, rocks, and flesh, things unintelligible,And light on waving grass, he knows not when,And feet that ran, but where, he cannot tell.The Pacific, 1914. THE STORM John Drinkwater (To 8.V.J.)The Characters are—ALICE.JOAN, her young Sister.SARAH.AN OLD MAN.A YOUNG STRANGER.A mountain cottage. It is a midwinter night. Outside a snowstormrages.Alice is looking through the window. Joan, her young sister, andSarah, an old neighbour woman, are sitting over the fire.Alice : It isn't fair of God. Eyes are no good,Nor lanterns in a blackness like to that.How can they find him out ? It isn't fair.Sarah: God is for prayers. You'll anger Him speaking so.Alice : I have prayed these hours, and now I'm tired of it.He is caught in some grip of the rocks, and crying out,And crying and crying, and none can hear him cry,Because of this great beastliness of noise.Sarah : Past crying now, I think.Joan : There, take no heedOf what she says—it's a rusty mind she has,Being old, and wizened with bad luck on the hills.Sarah: Rusty or no, I've a thought the man is dead.No news has been growing apace from nightfall onInto bad news, and now it's as though one stoodAt the door and said,—we found him lying cold.Alice : Whist! you old bitter woman. Will it never stay In its wicked fury, . . . and the snow's like a black rainWhipping the crying wind. If it would rest awhileI could think and mind me what were best to doTo help my man. But a savagery like thisBeats at the wits till they have no tidiness.Sarah: We'll sit and wait till they come.Alice : And I a womanWould never let him ask for anything,Because of the daily thought I took for him,—And against this spite now I've no strength at all.Sarah : For all you would bake his bread to a proper turnAnd remember always the day for his clean shift,There was many a scolding word for him to bear.Joan: Hush—Alice: Let her talk. What does she know at all,—Thinking crossed words between a man and a womanHave anything to do with the heart ? We have,My man and I, more than a fretful moodCan thieve or touch. My man—I must go myself.Joan : There is nothing you could do.Sarah: 'Tis menShould carry the dead man in.Alice: My manIs alive Isay—surely my man's not dead—Surely, I say—old woman, your croaking talkTeases my brain like the pestilence out thereTill I doubt the thing I know. There's not a cragOr a cleft of the hills but is natural to him As the stairs beyond the door there—surely, surely—Yet nothing is sure.Sarah: Death has a way with him,A confident way.Alice : You know that he's not dead—I know that too—if only that dark rageHowling out there would leave tormenting me,And let me reason it out in peace a little,I could be quite, quite sure that he's not dead.Sarah : Age is a quiet place where you can watchThe world bent with its pain and still be patient,And warm your hands by the fire because you knowThat the newest sorrow and the oldest sorrow are one.They will bring him and put him down upon the floor:Be ready for that, girl. There are times when hope is cruelAs a fancy-man that goes without good-bye.Alice: I have a brain that is known in three shire-townsFor a level bargain. It is strange that I should beListening now to a cracked old woman's clatterWhen my own thoughts for him should be so clearThat I shouldn't heed the words of another body.I want no hope—only an easy spaceTo remember the skill of my man among the hillsAnd how he would surely match their cunning with his,—Or else to count the hours that he's been goneAnd see that his chance is whittled quite away.To have a living thought against this fearIs all I want—but those screaming devils thereBeat in my mind like the drums in Carnarvon streets B That they use when they want to cheat folk into thinkingThat death is a handsome trade.—And soI let a woman with none but leaky witsTell me the way I should be,—when most I needTo ride no borrowed sense.Sarah : It is not wind,For all it is louder than any flood on the hills,Nor the crazy snow that maddens you till your brainIs like three cats howling upon a wall,But the darkness that comes creeping on a womanWhen she knows of grief before it is spoken out.And the sooner grieved is grief the sooner gone.Be ready to make him decent for the grave.Joan : If he should walk in now you will not forgetThe trouble you are putting in the house with your talk.Sarah : The trouble is here.Alice : If he should walk in now—Yes, that's the way to think. I'll work it out,Slowly, his doings from when he left the doorUntil he comes again. You stood at the ovenWith cakes half-browned against his tea. And IStood here beside my man and strapped his coatUnder his chin. He looked across your way—He is fond of you, child—he calls you Father JoanBecause—but that's not it—I told him thenTo-morrow would be time to bring the slates,And let him only mend the wire to-day—He thought so too and said—it is like a beastGreater than half the world and crushed in a trap,Shrieking against the pain—what did he say ?— I have forgotten now, and I had begunTo follow it all quite clearly—what did he say ?Joan : That an hour would see him back, and hungry too.Alice: An hour would bring him back—but that is nothingI know it now: he went to the broken wireAnd mended it—three quarters of an hour—And then he would think that after all the slatesWere best bespoken now—six miles to go :He would be about a mile when this began—This wrath that will surely last till the Judgment Day—And that would make two hours till he reached the quarry—But he went on, and the neighbours up and downWere scared and went out searching with their lanterns,Iyike lighted gnats searching the mines of hell.Isn't it queer to see them out there dancingWhen all the time he has gone a twelve mile journey—And then this old woman came with her neighbour duty—It's odd folk are,—Sarah: It's a poor thing, spinning talesWhen there's no faith in them.Alice : Hush, I have it allQuite clearly now, in spite of that monster baying,—Two hours to the quarry, hindered by the night,Then half an hour to bargain, then two hoursFor beating back, his boots heavy with snow,Or a little longer—five hours and more all told—It is nine o'clock—he went five hours ago,Or a little more, so that's just how it works—He should be coming now along the road,Tired—we must warm the cakes again. Sarah : Ay, warm them,A dead man's heavy bearing.The clock strikes nine.Alice : That's the timeTo bring him back, and we'll call the lanterns in—He must be near by now—A man is heard outside, kicking thesnow off his boots. Alice opens thedoor, and an old man comes in, carryingan unlit lantern.The Old]Man : My candle is spent.Joan takes the lantern and fits a newcandle while they speak.Alice: And you are going out again ?They have not found him ?The Old Man : No. It's not easy there.Alice : Then he didn't go to the quarry after all.Joan : Because they hav'n't found him ? That's no sign.They couldn't if he went.Alice : Ah yes—how is it?—He went, and they've been looking on the hills—But have not found him. Yes—he must have gone.He should be back. You should have found him for me.Sarah : She is strange because of the trouble in the house.I am old, and that is something.Alice : It is not that—I am caught away from myself by the screaming thingThat scourges the hills. And yet in spite of thatI had reckoned all his doings since he went Until his time for coming—but you came—You came instead. That is not right.The Old Man {taking the lantern and lighting it) : We'll sendAcross to the quarry now—Alice : It is no use—Hell not have gone.The Old Man : The night is full of tricks,But another hour will have ferreted all the hill.He goes out.Sarah: Simon who took his money down to marketAnd wouldn't change for a good sound fact of cattle,Fingered his earnings till a hole was wornAnd came to the house again with an empty bag.Iyeave making tales, my girl, poor tales—they bring no profit,Keeping the truth outside, and breaking awayTo a thimbleful of ash themselves. He is dead.Think hard on that. When the old king of the worldWith the scourge and flail turns his strokes from the wheatOn the goodman's floor and scars the goodman's back,It is no time to wince. Your man is dead.And a day and a day make Adam's fall a story.Alice: Not down to the quarry—then—my little Joan,Do you know at all what a man becomes to a woman ?How should you though ? If a man should takeA patch of the barren hill and dig with his hands,And down and down till he came to marble and gold,And labouring then for a dozen years or twentyShould build a place finer than Solomon's hallTill strangers with money to travel came to praise it, And, when he had dug and hewn and spent his yearsTo make it a wonder, should go, and be rememberedNo more than an onion-pedlar in the streetBy the gaping travellers, yet he might be glad,If his heart was as big as a woman's, for the thing he'd made,The strong and lovely thing, knowing it risenOut of his thought into the talk of the world.That's how it is. A woman takes a mate,And like the patient builder governs himInto the goodman known through a countryside,Or the wise friend that the neighbours will seek out,And he, for all his love, may never knowHow she has nourished the dear fine masteryThat bids him daily down the busy roadAnd leaves her by the hearth. And when he is deadIt comes to her that the strength she has given himTo make him a gallant figure among them allHas been the thing that has filled her, and she lonely,Or gossiping with the folk, or about the house.Sarah : When he is dead.Alice : Why should I think of that ?I am crazed, I say, because of the madness loosedAnd beating against the panes. He is not dead—You know it woman— Joan, it would be a lieTo say my man is dead ?Joan : There, sister, wait—It is all we can do—there is nothing else to do.Sarah: When he is dead. Let the thought that comes unbiddenBe welcome, for it's the best thought. When he is dead. Alice : There is treachery against us—my man—my dear—My brave love—they are trying to part us now !But we must be too strong when .... when he is dead ....There is a knock at the door. Shemakes a half movement towards it.He would not knock. See who it is.Joan opens the door and a YoungTraveller, buffeted and breathless, comesin.The Stranger : By Thor !There's beauty trampling men like crumpled leaves.May I come in till it's gone ?Joan: Surely.The Stranger : I setEvery sinew taut against this power,This supple torrent of might that suddenly roseOut of the fallen dusk and sang and leaptLike an athlete of the gods frenzied with wine.It seemed to rear challenging against me,As though the master from Valhalla's tables,Grown heady in his revels, had cried out—Behold me now crashing across the earthTo shake the colonies of antic menInto a fear shall be a jest, my fellows !And I measured myself against this bragging pride,Climbing step by step through the blinding riotOf frozen flakes swung on the cataract wind,My veins praising the tyranny that was matchedAgainst this poor ambitious body of mine. Alice : The storm is drenched with treachery and sin—It is not good to praise it.The Stranger : You on the hillsGrow dulled, maybe, to the royalty that findsIn your crooked world a thousand splendid hours,And a storm to you is but a hindered taskOr a wall for mending or a gap in the flock.But I was strange among this gaietyPlying black looms in a black firmament,This joy that was spilt out of the iron heavensWhere pity is not bidden to the heartsOf the immaculate gods. I was a dream,A cold monotony suddenly thrustInto a waking world of lusty change,A wizened death elected from the wasteTo strive and mate with eager lords of tumult.Beauty was winged about me, darkling speedTook pressure of earth and smote against my face;I rode upon the front of heroic hours,And once was on the crest of the world's tide,Unseared as the elements.—But he mastered me,That god striking a star for holiday,And filled himself with great barbaric laughterTo see me slink away.Alice : It is no god,But a brainless anger, a gaunt and evil thingThat blame can't reach.The Stranger : Not all have eyes to see.—I'm harsh with my words, but I come from a harsh quarrelWith larger thews than man's. Alice : Stranger, lld giveComely words to any who knocks at the door.You are welcome—but leave your praising of this blight.You safely gabbing of sly and cruel furies,Like a child laughing before a cage of tigers.You with your fancy talk of lords and godsAnd your hero-veins—young man, do you know this nightIs eating through my bones into the marrow,And creeping round my brain till thought is dead,And making my heart the oldest thing of any ?Do you see those lights ?The Stranger : They seemed odd moving there,In a storm like this.Alice : A man is lost on the hills.The Stranger : That's bad. But who ?Alice : My man is lost on the hills.Sarah : She has it now; her man is dead on the hills.The Stranger: I talked amiss, not knowing of trouble here.But why should he be dead ?Alice : The woman is worn,Her mind is worn, and she lives out of the world.You ask at once as any wise man would.I have told her and told and told that he's not dead,And my young sister, too, though but a girl,Says it, and she has a head beyond her years.He is lost for an hour, or maybe for a night,But never dead. That is the way you think ?It is waiting that steals your proper sense away;And then, although you know, you let in fear Blaspheming the thing you know—it is waiting to-nightIn the midst of an idiot wrath drumming and drummingL,ike a plague of bees in swarm above your eyes.Ido not know—I have not any strengthTo fathom it now, and there is none to tell me.Sarah : She knows it all, though the thing is hard to say.Alice : Have done ! Young stranger, you have travelled the world.I think, or have grown learned in great cities,And can tell the way things go—is it not wrongTo say that a man because of an ugly nightShould perish on his home-ground ? He would find a roadOut of a danger such as that, becauseThat is the way things happen—tell me now ?The Stranger: It is likely that he would.Alice : You hear that, Joan—A traveller who has been in foreign dangersAnd comes a scholar from a hundred citiesSays it is well, and that we must be patient.The Stranger : No, I've not travelled, and I only say a manKnowing the hills would likely weather a storm.Alice : There, there—you must not take it back again,Because you know, and you have said it is well.Sarah : They cut a stone that is like a small church window,And they carve a name and a line out of the book,And when that's done there is nothing then to doubt.The storm has suddenly cleared. The"silence falls upon them strangely, and there'is a pause.Alice : It is spent at last. He will come from his shelter now. My dear—come soon. Set the kettle again.Joan does so. There is another pause.I have my thought again. It is an end.lam broken. There is no pity anywhere.The Stranger: The lights are coming.Sarah : The anger never bates,But scourges us till time betrays the limbs,And strikes the tongue, and puts pence on the eyes,And leaves the latch for stranger hands to lift.The blackness beyond the window hasgiven place to clear starlight on the hills.A number of men with lanterns pass by.There is a knock: Alice opens the door,and the old man stands there with hislighted lantern. She looks at him, andneither speaks. She turns away to thetable.Alice : Why have we waited .... all this time .... to knowHer sorrow breaks over her.The End WHEELS Wilfrid Wilson Gibson To safety of the kerb he thrust the crone :When a shaft took him in the back, and proneHe tumbled heavily, but all unheardAmid the scurry of wheels that crashed and whirredAbout his senseless head—his helmet crushedIyike crumpled paper by a car that rushedUpon him unaware. And as he layHe heard again the wheels he'd heard all dayAbout him on point-duty . . . only nowEach red-hot wheel ran searing over his brow—A sizzling star with hub and spokes and tyreOne monstrous Catherine-wheel of sparking fireWhirring down windy tunnels of the night . . .That Catherine-wheel, somehow it will not light—Fixed to the broken paling ; and the pinPricks the boy's finger as he jabs it in :He sucks the salty blood—the spiteful thingFires, whizzing, sputtering sparks: he feels them stingHis wincing cheek; and, on the damp night-air,The stench of burnt saltpetre and singed hair . . .While still he lies and listens without fearTo the loud traffic rumbling in his ear—Wheels rumbling in his ear, and through his brainFor evermore, a never-ending trainOf scarlet postal-vans that whirl one redPerpetual hot procession through his head—His head that's just a clanking, clattering millOf grinding wheels . . . and down an endless hillAfter his hoop he runs, a little lad,Barefooted 'neath the stars, in nightshirt clad—And stumbles into bed, the stars all gone, Though in his head the hoop keeps running onAnd on and on : his head grown big and wideHolds all the windy night and stars inside .And still within a hair's breadth of his earThe crunch and gride of wheels rings sharp and clear,Huge lumbering wagons, crusted axle-deepWith country marl, their drivers half-asleepAgainst green toppling mounds of cabbagesStill crisp with dewy airs, or stacks of cheeseSmelling of Arcady, till all the skyIn clouds of cheese and cabbages rolls by—Great golden cheeses wheeling through the night,And giant cabbages of emerald lightThat tumble after, scattering crystal drops . . .While in his ear the grinding never stops—Wheels grinding asphalt . . . then a high-piled wainOf mignonette in boxes . . . and again,A baby at his father's cottage-doorHe toddles, treading on his pinafore,And tumbles headlong in a bed of bloom,Half smothered in the deep, sweet honeyed gloomOf crushed, wet blossom; and the hum of bees—Big bumble-bees that buzz through flowery trees—Grows furious . . . changing to a roar of wheelsAnd honk of hooting horns: and now he feelsThat all the cars in London filled with lightAre bearing down upon him through the night,As out of hall and theatre there pourWhite-shouldered women, ever more and more,Bright-eyed, with flashing teeth, borne in a throngOf purring, glittering cars, ten thousand strong: Each drowsy dame and eager chattering lasslaughing unheard within her box of glass . . .And then great darkness, and a clanging bell—Clanging beneath the hollow dome of hellAglow like burnished copper; and a roarOf wheels and wheels and wheels for evermore,As engine after engine crashes byWith clank and rattle under that red sky,Dropping a trail of burning coals behind,That scorch his eyeballs till he lies half-blind,Smouldering to cinder in a vasty nightOf wheeling worlds and stars in whirring flight,And suns that blaze in thunderous fury onFor ever and for ever, yet are goneBre he can gasp to see them . . . head to heelsSlung round a monstrous red-hot hub, that wheelsAcross infinity, with spokes of fireThat dwindle slowly till the shrinking tyreIs clamped like aching ice about his head . . .He smells clean acid smells : and safe in bedHe wakens in a lime-washed ward, to hearSomebody moaning almost in his ear,And knows that it's himself that moans : and then,Battling his way back to the world of men,He sees with leaden eyelids opening wide,His young wife gravely knitting by his side. HOOPS SCENE : The big tent-stable of a travelling circus. On the groundnear the entrance, GENTLEMAN JOHN, stableman and generalodd-job man, lies smoking beside MERRY ANDREW, the clown.GENTLEMAN JOHN is a little hunched man with a sensitive faceand dreamy eyes. MERRY ANDREW, who is resting betweenthe afternoon and evening performances, with his clown's hat lyingbeside him, wears a crimson wig, and a baggy suit of orange-colouredcotton, patterned with purple cats. His face is chalked dead white,and painted with a set grin, so that it is impossible to see what mannerof man he is. In the background are camels and elephants feeding,dimly visible in the steamy dusk of the tent.Gentleman John : And then consider camels : only thinkOf camels long enough, and you'ld go mad—With all their humps and lumps; their knobbly knees,Splay feet, and straddle legs; their sagging necks,Flat flanks, and scraggy tails, and monstrous teeth.I've not forgotten the first fiend I met :'Twas in a lane in Smyrna, just a ditchBetween the shuttered houses, and so narrowThe brute's bulk blocked the road; the huge green stackOf dewy fodder that it slouched beneathBrushing the yellow walls on either hand,And shutting out the strip of burning blue:And I'd to face that vicious bobbing headWith evil eyes, slack lips, and nightmare teeth,And duck beneath the snaky squirming neck,Pranked with its silly string of bright blue beads,That seemed to wriggle every way at once,As though it were a hydra. Allah's beard!But I was scared, and nearly turned and ran.I felt that muzzle take me by the scruff,And heard those murderous teeth crunching my spine, Before I stooped—though I dodged safely under.I've always been afraid of ugliness:I'm such a toad myself, I hate all toads;And the camel is the ugliest toad of allTo my mind; and it's just my devil's luckI've come to this—to be a camel's lackey,To fetch and carry for original sin;For, sure enough, the camel's old evil incarnate.Blue beads and amulets to ward off evil!No eye's more evil than a camel's eye.The elephant is quite a comely beast,Compared with Satan camel,—trunk and all,His floppy ears, and his inconsequent tail.He's stolid, but, at least, a gentleman.It does not hurt my pride to valet him,And bring his shaving-water. He's a lord.Only the bluest blood that has come downThrough generations from the mastodonCould carry off that tail with dignity,That tail and trunk. He cannot look absurd,For all the monkey tricks you put him through,Your paper hoops and popguns. He just makesHis masters look ridiculous, when his pomp'sButchered to make a bumpkin's holiday.He's dignity itself, and proper pride,That stands serenely in a circus-worldOf mountebanks and monkeys. He has weightBehind him: aeons of primeval powerHave shaped that pillared bulk; and he stands sure,Solid, substantial on the world's foundations.And he has form, form that's too big a thing To be called beauty. Once, long since, I thoughtTo be a poet, and shape words, and mouldA poem like an elephant, huge, sublime,To front oblivion : and because I failed,And all my rhymes were gawky, shambling camels,Or else obscene, blue-buttocked apes, I'm doomedTo lackey it for things such as I've made,Till one of them crunches my back-bone with his teeth,Or knocks my wind out with a forthright kickClean in the midriff: crumpling up in deathThe hunched and stunted body that was me,John, the apostle of the Perfect Form!Jerusalem ! I'm talking—like a book,As you would say: and a bad book at that,A maundering, kiss-mammy book—The Hunchback's EndOr The Camel-Keeper's Reward—would be the title.I froth and bubble like a new-broached cask.No wonder you look glum, for all your grin.What makes you mope ? You've naught to growse about.You've got no hump. Your body's brave and straight—So shapely even that you can affordTo trick it in fantastic shapelessness,Knowing that there's a clean-limbed man beneathPreposterous pantaloons and purple cats.I would have been a poet, if I could :But better than shaping poems 'twould have been,To have had a comely body and clean limbsObedient to my bidding.Merry Andrew: I missed a hoopThis afternoon. c Gentleman John : You missed a hoop ? You mean . . .Merry Andrew : That lam done, used up, scrapped, on the shelf,Out of the running—only that, no more.Gentleman John: Well, I've been missing hoops my whole life[long;Though, when I come to think of it, perhapsThere's little consolation to be chewedFrom crumbs that I can offer.Merry Andrew : I've not missedA hoop since I was six. I'm forty-two.This is the first time that my body's failed me :But 'twill not be the last. And .Gentleman John : Such is life !You're going to say. You see I've got it pat,Your jaded wheeze. Lord, what a wit I'ld makeIf I'd a set grin painted on my face.And such is life, I'ld say a hundred times,And each time set the world aroar afreshAt my original humour. Missed a hoop !Why, man alive, you've naught to grumble at.I've boggled every hoop since I was six.I'm fifty-five; and I've run round a ringWould make this potty circus seem a pinhole.I wasn't born to sawdust. I'd the worldFor circus . . .Merry Andrew : It's no time for crowing now.I know a gentleman, and take on trustThe silver spoon and all. My teeth were cutUpon a horseshoe : and I wasn't bornTo purple and fine linen—but to sawdust, To sawdust, as you say—brought up on sawdust.I've had to make my daily bread of sawdust:Ay, and my children's,—children's, that's the rub,As Shakespeare says . . .Gentleman John : Ah, there you go again !What a rare wit to set the ring aroar—As Shakespeare says ! Crowing ? A gentleman ?Man, didn't you say you'd never missed a hoop ?It's only gentlemen who miss no hoops,Clean-livers, easy lords of life who takeEach obstacle at a leap, who never fail.You are the gentleman.Merry Andrew: Now don't you tryBeing funny at my expense; or you'll soon findI'm not quite done for yet—not quite snuffed out.There's still a spark of life. You may have words :But I've a fist will be a match for them.Words slaver feebly from a broken jaw.I've always lived straight, as a man must doIn my profession, if held keep in fettle :But I'm no gentleman, for I fail to seeThere's any sport in baiting a poor manBecause he's losing grip at forty-two,And sees his livelihood slipping from his grasp—Ay, and his children's bread.Gentleman John : Why, man alive,Who's baiting you ? This winded, broken cur,That limps through life, to bait a bull like you !You don't want pity, man ! The beaten bull,Even when the dogs are tearing at his gullet, Turns no eye up for pity. I myself,Crippled and hunched and twisted as I am,Would make a brave fend to stand up to youUntil you swallowed your words, if you should slobberYour pity over me. A bull! Nay, man,You're nothing but a bear with a sore head.A bee has stung you—you who've lived on honey.Sawdust, forsooth ! You've had the sweet of life:You've munched the honeycomb till . . .Merry Andrew: Ay, talk's cheap.But you've no children. You don't understand.Gentleman John: I have no children: I don't understand!Merry Andrew: It's children make the difference.Gentleman John : Man alive—Alive and kicking, though you're shamming dead—You've hit the truth at last. It's that, just that,Makes all the difference. If you hadn't children,I'ld find it in my heart to pity you,Granted you'ld let me. I don't understand!I've seen you stripped. I've seen your children stripped.You've never seen me naked; but you can guessThe misstitched, gnarled, and crooked thing I am.Now, do you understand ? I may have words.But you, man, do you never burn with prideThat you've begotten those six limber bodies,Firm flesh, and supple sinew, and lithe limb—Six nimble lads, each like young Absalom,With red blood running lively in his veins,Bone of your bone, your very flesh and blood ?It's you don't understand. God, what I'ld give This moment to be you, just as you are,Preposterous pantaloons and purple catsAnd painted leer and crimson curls and all,To be you now, with only one missed hoop,If I'd six clean-limbed children of my loins,Born of the ecstasy of life within me,To keep it quick and valiant in the ringWhen I . . . but I . . . Man, man, you've missed a hoop:But they'll take every hoop like blooded colts:And 'twill be you in them that leaps through life,And in their children, and their children's children.God! doesn't it make you hold your breath to thinkThere'll always be an Andrew in the ring,The very spit and image of you stripped,While life's old circus lasts ? And I ... at leastThere is no twisted thing of my begettingTo keep my shame alive: and that's the mostThat I've to pride myself upon. But, God,I'm proud, ay, proud as Lucifer, of that.Think what it means, with all the urge and sting,When such a lust of life runs in the veins.You, with your six sons, and your one missed hoop,Put that thought in your pipe, and smoke it. Well,And how d'you like the flavour ? Something bitter ?And burns the tongue a trifle ? That's the brandThat I must smoke while I've the breath to puff.{pause.)I've always worshipped the body, all my life—The body quick with the perfect health which is beauty,Iyively, lissom, alert, and taking its wayThrough the world with the easy gait of the early Gods. The only moments I've lived my life to the fullAnd that live again in remembrance unfaded are thoseWhen I've seen life compact in some perfect body,The living God made manifest in man:A diver in the Mediterranean, resting,With sleeked black hair, and glistening salt-tanned skin,Gripping the quivering gunwale with tense hands,His torso lifted out of the peacock sea,I&lt;ike Neptune, carved in amber, come to life:A stark Egyptian on the Nile's edge poisedI/ike a bronze Osiris against the lush, rank green :A fisherman dancing reels, on New Year's Eve,In a hall of shadowy rafters and flickering lights,At St. Abbs on the Berwickshire coast, to the skirl of the pipes,The lift of the wave in his heels, the sea in his veins :A Cherokee Indian, as though he were one with his horse,His coppery shoulders agleam, his feathers aflameWith the last of the sun, descending a gulch in Alaska:A brawny Cleveland puddler, stripped to the loins,On the cauldron's brink, stirring the molten ironIn the white-hot glow, a man of white-hot metal:A Cornish ploughboy driving an easy shareThrough the grey, light soil of a headland, against a seaOf sapphire, gay in his new white corduroys,Blue-eyed, dark-haired, and whistling a careless tune:Jack Johnson, stripped for the ring, in his swarthy prideOf sleek and rippling muscle . . .Merry Andrew: Jack's the boy!Ay, he's the proper figure of a man.But he'll grow fat and flabby and scant of breath.He'll miss his hoop some day. Gentleman John: But what are wordsTo shape the joy of form ? The Greeks did best,To cut in marble or to cast in bronzeTheir ecstasy of living. I rememberA marvellous Hermes that I saw in Athens,Fished from the very bottom of the deepWhere he had lain, two thousand years or more,Wrecked with a galley-full of Roman pirates,Among the white bones of his plunderers,Whose flesh had fed the fishes as they sank—Serene in cold, imperishable beauty,Biding his time till he should rise again,Bxultant from the wave, for all men's worship,The morning-spring of life, the youth of the world,Shaped in sea-coloured bronze for everlasting.Ay, the Greeks knew : but men have forgotten now.Not easily do we meet beauty walkingThe world to-day in all the body's pride.That's why I'm here—a stable-boy to camels—For in the circus-ring there's more delightOf seemly bodies, goodly in sheer health,Bodies trained and tuned to the perfect pitch,Eager, blithe, debonair, from head to heelAglow and alive in every pulse, than elsewhereIn this machine-ridden land of grimy, glumRound- shouldered, coughing mechanics. Once I livedIn London, in a slum called Paradise,Sickened to see the greasy pavements crawlingWith puny flabby babies, thick as maggots.Poor brats ! I'ld soon go mad, if I'd to live In London with its stunted men and womenBut little better to look on than myself.Yet, there's an island where the men keep fit—St. Kilda's, a stark fastness of high crag :They must keep fit or famish : their main foodThe Solan goose; and it's a chancy jobTo climb down a sheer face of slippery graniteAnd drop a noose over the sentinel birdEre he can squawk to rouse the sleeping flock.They must keep fit—their bodies taut and trim—To have the nerve : and they're like tempered steel,Suppled and fined. But even they've grown slackerThrough traffic with the mainland, in these days.A hundred years ago, the custom heldThat none should take a wife, till he had stood,His left heel on the dizziest point of crag,His right leg and both arms stretched in mid-air,Above the sea : three hundred feet to dropTo death, if he should fail—a Spartan test.But any man who could have failed, would scarceHave earned his livelihood, or his children's breadOn that bleak rock.Merry Andrew : (drowsily) Ay, children—that's it, children !Gentleman John : St. Kilda's children had a chance, at least,With none begotten idly of weakling fathers.A Spartan test for fatherhood! Should they missTheir hoop, 'twas death—and childless. You have stillSix lives to take unending hoops for you,And you yourself are not done yet . . .Merry Andrew (more drowsily) : Not yet,And there's much comfort in the thought of children. They're bonnie boys enough, and should do well,If I can but keep going a little while,A little longer till . . .Gentleman John : Six strapping sons !And I have naught but camels.{pause.)Yet, I've seenA vision in this stable that puts to shameKach ecstasy of mortal flesh and bloodThat's been my eyes' delight. I never breathedA word of it toman or woman yet:I couldn't whisper it now to you, if you lookedIvike any human thing this side of death.'Twas on the night I stumbled on the circus.I'd wandered all day, lost among the fells,Over snow-smothered hills, through blinding blizzard,Whipped by a wind that seemed to strip and skin me,Till I was one numb ache of sodden ice.Quite done, and drunk with cold, lld soon have droppedDead in a ditch, when suddenly a lanternDazzled my eyes. I smelt a queer warm smell;And felt a hot puff in my face ; and blunderedOut of the flurry of snow and raking windDizzily into a glowing Arabian nightOf elephants and camels having supper.I thought that I'd gone mad, stark, staring mad :But I was much too sleepy to mind just then—Dropped dead-asleep upon a truss of hay;And lay, a log, till—well, I cannot tellHow long I lay unconscious. I but knowI slept, and wakened : and that 'twas no dream. I heard a rustle in the hay beside me;And opening sleepy eyes, scarce marvelling,I saw her, standing naked in the lamplight,Beneath the huge tent's cavernous canopy,Against the throng of elephants and camelsThat champed unwondering in the golden dusk,Moon-white Diana, mettled Artemis—Her body quick and tense as her own bowstring—Her spirit, an arrow barbed and strung for flight—White snow-flakes melting on her night-black hair,And on her glistening breasts and supple thighs:Her red lips parted, her keen eyes aliveWith fierce, far-ranging hungers of the chaseOver the hills of morn . . . The lantern guttered :And I was left alone in the outer darknessAmong the champing elephants and camels.And I'll be a camel-keeper to the end:Though never again my eyes . . .{pause.)So, you can sleep,.You Merry Andrew, for all you missed your hoop.It's just as well, perhaps. Now I can holdMy secret to the end. Ah, here they come!(Six lads, between the ages of three and twelve, clad in pinktights covered with silver spangles, tumble into the tent.)The Eldest Boy: Daddy, the bell's rung, and . . .Gentleman John: He's snoozing sound.(to the youngest boy)You just creep quietly, and take tight holdOf the crimson curls, and tug, and you will hearThe purple pussies all caterwaul at once. THE INNOCENTS Lascelles Abercrombie Night had squander'd over the glowing airThe thousands of her stars. A slender woman—Sure-foot treading the path her childhood knew—Smiled at them as she went, in haste for homeAfter the long day of a widow's toil;Her tired body loving the thought of sleep,But her heart planning eager things. She seemedTo face the loft of splendours, as her mindWould match itself with the exulting blueThat owns the treasures of eternal light:" A little piece of life that time has takenInto his hands, and soon will have it squaredTo lie still in the work he builds for ever,As men make stones the size for masonry;The little life and the few years I amMight stand beside you in your glorying,And it would not be boldness. I can declareA spirit of desire that has its rangeEndless as you, O blue depths of the darkness,You in whom space is perfect; and the gleeThat I can make will mock your whitest stars.You cannot look me down, you everlasting:Death is as measureless as you, and IAm love that fills the greatness of death fullOf burning never to be alight, as darkAs your blue burns; and in the midst lamShining love whose motion is faultless flameMeasured in starry flights of living joy—Still kindling new radiant attendance roundMy little laughing son, the life my lover Required, when I was worshipt by his beauty.0 night, infinite room of fire rejoicing,1 know where you are equalled, I that amIyove for a lover dead and a son living! "By this there should have been a golden eyeOf candlelight watching for her approach,The gleaming window that would seem her hourOf joy looking to take her back again.But there was only night in front of her:The house was dark and noiseless, a strange bulkOf blacker night, filled with quieter silence;And she was nothing to it; it had lostAll that it was in some great lonely passionIt could not share; and would not heed aught else :So blank it stood, a rapt thing. She was quickTo push the door wide, and stand listeningWithin the walls. Instantly on her mindThe sense of outdoor darkness, with the worldEased of its weight, alter'd to graver darknessPressing down as thick as deep-sea water,A load of darkness; yet not so quickly changedShe could not feel the mood in the noiseless houseFor a tick of her heart shudder and shrink offWhen the latch rapt and her movement stirred against it;Then settle back and close over her brain.But joy was eager in her, and drew inThese swerving motions of her thought. She bentTo peer into the room, and held her armsReady to catch the boy running to her."You are both very still! Is this to be A hiding game ? Where are you, little knave ?L,augh, little deceiver : I'll track your voiceHome to its darling breast. Out with a jump,You minim of the rogues, and frighten me !—Mother, where is he ? What's my sweetheart doing ?—Where are you, mother ? —Gone ? they can't be gone ! "She started forward; but her mother's voiceCame very quiet from the back of the roomAnd held her, as though it took her by the soul."Be careful. Make a light before you move,Else you may stumble "" It must be near you,The tinder-box ! Has some harm come to him ?Quick, mother, strike! "" Near me, yes ; I forgot.Do not come in : wait for the light; or elseYou may trip I have been sitting here so long,So long, I have almost stiffen'd into an image.But wait: the cramp's against my hurrying.And I'm not ready for you yet; just nowI tried to make out what I ought to say.""He is hurt then ? Have you put him to bed ? "Wait, wait, girl; stay there, or you'll now it glows;My hands were shivering more than I knew.Now for the candle : eh, my fingers areA palsy, or doddering ague. Now I hopeGod will be with your heart as well as mine."The light grew round the flame, a golden mistHanging confused with darkness rather than light.And when the room was full of it, she saw Where her boy lay; right at her feet he lay,Naked, with open eyes, speared in the breast.Her throat lockt terribly on her shrieking breath.When her stunn'd heart felt its fearful beating,And blacken'd mind awoke to dazzling anguish,She heard her mother speaking, as talk soundsFloating out of a window very high up."It was the soldiers. They had made them drunk;And some were laughing drunk; but most were wild,Ivike men who keep a shouting fury upFor fear they'll be afraid; and there was oneWho cried and cried like broken-hearted madness.* I can't be doing this,' he said, ' not this; 'And it was he that snatcht the boy from me And then the laughers and the swearers ranOut of the house like men escaping fire,Iyaughing and swearing still: and he aloneStayed crying here, and looking on his work,And saying still, ' I can't do things like this! ' "" But why ? why ? What has come to the world ? "" Messiah has come. The world is to be saved."" Will you jeer at me ? A Messiah who leavesMy baby to the fiends, and saves the world ?Is it the time for that talk ? Will the dreamsThat comforted old men posed with the worldHave any quiet for me ? And were they truthBlazed on the world, they would not alter this ! "" As well as I could learn it, there's no taleNow of the Iyord riding down the heathenSudden as thunder among them, and the Jews To follow singing after his amazement.The tale is nothing of that, but of a babyBorn in Jewry, none knows where, and likelyWhen he is grown—they say 'tis sworn in the stars—To pull the power of the king clattering down;Because his mind will be the mind of God,And he will change men's lives, so that they breakThe world about them like an evil habit,And make a new world out of righteousness:'Tis so my thought pieces the broken tale.But the king will not have the world so changed,And all the Jewish boys are to be killed.The fool! I,et there be blood from here to Rome,Our God will hide Messiah from his steel,The world will be new made after God's heart.""O be quiet! Ido not want the worldNew made after God's heart; I want my boyAlive and laughing, my little nimble boy!Why need the world be changed at all ? We two,I and my boy, would have delighted in it ;We would have stood in midst of the great worldAnd filled ourselves full of the sense of it:The burning days and forces of the night,Guarding man's living passion like a kingTaken captive and striding an endless road;We would have stood in midst of the great joyAnd the great sorrow of being in the worldAnd gloried in it, like musicians standingIn midst of the sound of their own mastery.—But she must murder him with her Messiah, That woman ! For the sake of pamperingThe brainsick lives that dare not love the world,He must be murder'd, my happy little dancer;And the bright world that played with him so gayMust turn against him in a hideous flashOf agony, and strike him dark for ever:O my darling, blinded and cold for ever!—What will your world, new made after God's heart,Offer my heart, to make this good to me ?—It may be holiness thriving up to heaven,'Twill not be rid of me; I'll be its shame;I'll haunt it; it shall hear me cry in its ears. . .
