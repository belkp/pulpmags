Each issue will be devoted exclusively to one individual, thereby giving him an opportunity to present his work in sufficient bulk tomake it possible for the reader to obtain a muchmore comprehensive grasp of his personality than isafforded him in the restricted space allotted by theother magazines. Published monthly, or more frequently if possible, THE GLEBE will issue twelveto twenty books per year, chosen on their meritsalone, since the subscription list does away with theneed of catering to the popular demand that confronts every publisher.

TO A GREEK MARBLE RICHARD ALDINGTON ll6Tvta, TC6TVC&lt;%White grave goddess,Pity my sadness,0 silence of Paros.1 am not of these about thy feet,These garments and decorum;I am thy brother,Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,And thou hearest me not.I have whispered thee in thy solitudesOf our loves in Phrygia,The far ecstasy of burning noonsWhen the fragile pipesCeased in the cypress shade,And the brown fingers of the shepherdMoved over slim shoulders;And only the cicada sang.I have told thee of the hillsAnd the lisp of reedsAnd the sun upon thy breasts,And thou hearest me not,Il6Tvta, Tc6Tvta,Thou hearest me not. AU VIEUX JARDIN RICHARD ALDINGTON I have sat here happy in the gardens,Watching the still pool and the reedsAnd the dark cloudsWhich the wind of the upper airTore like the green leafy boughsOf the divers-hued trees of late summer;But though I greatly delightIn these and the water lilies,That which sets me nighest to weepingIs the rose and white colour of the smooth flag-stones,And the pale yellow grassesAmong them. LESBIA RICHARD ALDINGTON Use no more speech now;Let the silence spread gold hair above usFold on delicate fold;You had the ivory of my life to carve.Use no more speech. And Picus of Mirandola is dead;And all the gods they dreamed and fabled of,Hermes, and Thoth, and Christ, are rotten now,Rotten and dank. And through it all I see your pale Greek face;Tenderness makes me as eager as a little childTo love youYou morsel left half cold on Caesar's plate. BEAUTY THOU HAST HURT ME OVERMUCH RICHARD ALDINGTON The light is a wound to me.The soft notesFeed upon the wound.Where wert thou bornO thou woeThat consumest my life?Whither comest thou?Toothed wind of the seas,No man knows thy beginning.As a bird with strong clawsThou woundest me,O beautiful sorrow. ARGYRIA RICHARD ALDINGTON O you,O you most fair,Swayer of reeds, whispererAmong the flowering rushes,You have hidden your handsBeneath the poplar leaves,You have given them to the white waters.Swallow-fleet,Sea-child cold from waves,Slight reed that sang so blithely in the wind,White cloud the white sun kissed into the air;Pan mourns for you.White limbs, white song,Pan mourns for you. IN THE VIA SESTINA RICHARD ALDINGTON O daughter of Isis,Thou standest beside the wet highwayOf this decayed Rome,A manifest harlot.Straight and slim art thouAs a marble phallus;Thy face is the face of IsisCarvenAs she is carven in basalt.And my heart stops with aweAt the presence of the gods,There beside thee on the stall of imagesIs the head of OsirisThy lord. THE RIVER RICHARD ALDINGTON I I drifted along the riverUntil I moored my boatBy these crossed trunks.Here the mist movesOver fragile leaves and rushes,Colourless waters and brown fading hills.She has come from beneath the trees,Moving within the mist,A floating leaf. II O blue flower of the evening,You have touched my faceWith your leaves of silver.Love me for I must depart. BROMIOS RICHARD ALDINGTON. The withered bonds are broken.The waxed reeds and the double pipeClamour about me;The hot wind swirlsThrough the red pine trunks.Io! the fauns and the satyrs.The touch of their shagged curled furAnd blunt horns!They have wine in heavy cratersPainted black and red;Wine to splash on her white body.Io!She shrinks from the cold shower—Afraid, afraid!Let the Maenads break through the myrtlesAnd the boughs of the rohododaphnai.Let them tear the quick deers' flesh.Ah, the cruel, exquisite fingers!Io!I have brought you the brown clusters,The ivy-boughs and pine-cones.Your breasts are cold sea-ripples,But they smell of the warm grasses. Throw wide the chiton and the peplum,Maidens of the Dew.Beautiful are your bodies, O Maenads,Beautiful the sudden folds,The vanishing curves of the white linenAbout you.Io!Hear the rich laughter of the forest,The cymbals,The trampling of the panisks and the centaurs. TO ATTHIS(After the Manuscript of Sappho now in Berlin) RICHARD ALDINGTON Atthis, far from me and dear Mnasidika,Dwells in Sardis;Many times she was near usSo that we lived life wellLike the far-famed goddessWhom above all things music delighted.And now she is first among the Lydian womenAs the mighty sun, the rose-fingered moon,Beside the great stars.And the light fades from the bitter seaAnd in like manner from the rich-blossoming earth;And the dew is shed upon the flowers,Rose and soft meadow-sweetAnd many-coloured melilote.Many things told are remembered of sterile Atthis.I yearn to behold thy delicate soulTo satiate my desire. . . . SITALKAS H. D. Thou art come at lengthMore beautifulThan any cool godIn a chamber underLycia's far coast,Than any high godWho touches us notHere in the seeded grass.Aye, than ArgestesScattering the broken leaves. HERMES OF THE WAYS H. D. I The hard sand breaks,And the grains of itAre clear as wine.Far off over the leagues of it,The wind,Playing on the wide shore,Piles little ridges,And the great wavesBreak over it.But more than the many-foamed waysOf the sea,I know himOf the triple path-ways,Hermes,Who awaiteth.Dubious,Facing three ways,Welcoming wayfarers,He whom the sea-orchardShelters from the west,From the eastWeathers sea-wind;Fronts the great dunes. Wind rushesOver the dunes,And the coarse, salt-crusted grassAnswers.Heu,It whips round my ankles! II Small isThis white stream,Flowing below groundFrom the poplar-shaded hill,But the water is sweet.Apples on the small treesAre hard,Too small,Too late ripenedBy a desperate sunThat struggles through sea-mist.The boughs of the treesAre twistedBy many bafflings;Twisted areThe small-leafed boughs.But the shadow of themIs not the shadow of the mast headNor of the torn sails. Hermes, Hermes,The great sea foamed,Gnashed its teeth about me;But you have waited,Where sea-grass tangles withShore-grass. PRIAPUSKeeper-of-Orchards H. D. I saw the first pearAs it fell.The honey-seeking, golden-banded,The yellow swarmWas not more fleet than I,(Spare us from loveliness!)And I fell prostrate,Crying,Thou hast flayed us with thy blossoms;Spare us the beautyOf fruit-trees!The honey-seekingPaused not,The air thundered their song,And I alone was prostrate.J.0 rough-hewnGod of the orchard,1 bring thee an offering;Do thou, alone unbeautiful(Son of the god),Spare us from loveliness.The fallen hazel-nuts,Stripped late of their green sheaths, The grapes, red-purple,Their berriesDripping with wine,Pomegranates already broken,And shrunken fig,And quinces untouched,I bring thee as offering. ACON(After Joannes Baptista Amaltheus) H. D. I Bear me to Dictaeus,And to the steep slopes;To the river Erymanthus.I choose spray of dittany,Cyperum frail of flower,Buds of myrrh,All-healing herbs,Close pressed in calathes.For she lies panting,Drawing sharp breath,Broken with harsh sobs,She, Hyella,Whom no god pitieth. II Dryads,Haunting the groves,Nereids,Who dwell in wet caves,For all the whitish leaves of olive-branch,And early roses,And ivy wreathes, woven gold berries,Which she once brought to your altars, Bear now ripe fruits from Arcadia,And Assyrian wineTo shatter her fever.The light of her face falls from its flower,As a hyacinth,Hidden in a far valley,Perishes upon burnt grass.Pales,Bring gifts,Bring your Phoenician stuffs,And do you, fleet-footed nymphs,Bring offerings,Illyrian iris,And a branch of shrub,And frail-headed poppies. HERMONAX H. D. *Gods of the sea;Ino,Leaving warm meadsFor the green, grey-green fastnessesOf the great deeps;And Palemon,Bright striker of sea-shaft,Hear me.Let all whom the sea loveth,Come to its altar front,And IWho can offer no other sacrifice to theeBring this.Broken by great waves,The wavelets flung it here,This sea-gliding creature,This strange creature like a weed,Covered with salt foam,Torn from the hillocksOf rock.I, Hermonax,Caster of nets,Risking chance,Plying the sea craft,Came on it. Thus to sea godCometh gift of sea wrack;I, Hermonax, offer itTo thee, Ino,And to Palemon. EPIGRAM(After the Greek) H. D. The golden one is gone from the banquets;She, beloved of Atimetus,The swallow, the bright Homonoea:Gone the dear chatterer. I F. S. FLINT London, my beautiful,it is not the sunsetnor the pale green skyshimmering through the curtainof the silver birch,nor the quietness;it is not the hoppingof birdsupon the lawn,nor the darknessstealing over all thingsthat moves me.4But as the moon creeps slowlyover the tree-topsamong the stars,I think of herand the glow her passingsheds on men.London, my beautiful,I will climbinto the branchesto the moonlit tree-tops,that my blood may be cooledby the wind. IIHALLUCINATION F. S. FLINT I know this room,and there are corridors:the pictures, I have seen before;the statues and those gems in casesI have wandered by before,—stood there silent and lonelyin a dream of years ago.I know the dark of night is all around me;my eyes are closed, and I am half asleep.My wife breathes gently at my side.But once again this old dream is within me,and I am on the threshold waiting,wondering, pleased, and fearful.Where do those doors lead,what rooms lie beyond them?I venture. . . .But my baby moves and tossesfrom side to side,and her need calls me to her.*Now I stand awake, unseeing,in the dark,and I move towards her cot. . . .I shall not reach her . . . There is 110 direction. . . .I shall walk on. . . . III F. S. FLINT Immortal? ... No,they cannot be, these people,nor I.Tired faces,eyes that have never seen the world,bodies that have never lived in air,lips that have never minted speech,they are the clipped and garbled,blocking the highway.They swarm and eddybetween the banks of glowing shopstowards the red meat,the potherbs,the cheap jacks,or surge inbefore the swift rushof the clanging trams,—pitiful, ugly, mean,encumbering. ,Immortal? . . .In a wood,watching the shadow of a birdleap from frond to frond of bracken,I am immortal.But these ? IV F. S. FLINT The grass is beneath my head;and I gazeat the thronging starsin the night.They fall . . . they fall. . . .I am overwhelmed,and afraid.Each leaf of the aspenis caressed by the wind,and each is crying.And the perfumeof invisible rosesdeepens the anguish.Let a strong mesh of rootsfeed the crimson of rosesupon my heart;and then fold over the hollowwhere all the pain was. VTHE SWAN F. S. FLINT Under the lily shadowand the goldand the blue and mauvethat the whin and the lilacpour down on the water,the fishes quiver.Over the green cold leavesand the rippled silverand the tarnished copperof its neck and beak,toward the deep black waterbeneath the arches,the swan floats slowly.Into the dark of the arch the swan floatsand into the black depth of my sorrowit bears a white rose of flame. NOCTURNES SKIPWITH CANNÉLL I Thy feet,That are like little, silver birds,Thou hast set upon pleasant ways;Therefore I will follow thee,Thou Dove of the Golden Eyes,Upon any path will I follow thee,For the light of thy beautyShines before me like a torch. II Thy feet are whiteUpon the foam of the sea;Hold me fast, thou bright Swan,Lest I stumble,And into deep waters. III Long have I beenBut the Singer beneath thy Casement,And now I am weary.I am sick with longing,O my Beloved;Therefore bear me with theeSwiftly sUpon our road. IV With the net of thy hairThou hast fished in the sea,And a strange fishHast thou caught in thy net;For thy hair,Beloved,Holdeth my heartWithin its web of gold. V I am weary with love, and thy lipsAre night-born popies.Give me therefore thy lipsThat I may know sleep. VI I am weary with longing,I am faint with love;For upon my head has the moonlightFallenAs a sword. IN A GARDEN AMY LOWELL Gushing from the mouths of stone menTo spread at ease under the skyIn granite-lipped basins,Where iris dabble their feetAnd rustle to a passing wind,The water fills the garden with its rushing,In the midst of the quiet of close-clipped lawns.Damp smell the ferns in tunnels of stone,Where trickle and plash the fountains,Marble fountains, yellowed with much water.Splashing down moss-tarnished stepsIt falls, the water;And the air is throbbing with it;With its gurgling and running;With its leaping, and deep, cool murmur.And I wished for night and you.I wanted to see you in the swimming-pool,White and shining in the silver-flecked water.While the moon rode over the garden,High in the arch of flight,And the scent of the lilacs was heavy with stillness.Night and the water, and you in your whiteness,bathing! POSTLUDE WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS Now that I have cooled to youLet there be gold of tarnished masonry,Temples soothed by the sun to ruinThat sleep utterly.Give me hand for the dances,Ripples at Phike, in and out,And lips, my Lesbian,Wall flowers that once were flame.Your hair is my CarthageAnd my arms the bowAnd our words arrowsTo shoot the stars,Who from that misty seaSwarm to destroy us.But you're there beside meOh, how shall I defy youWho wound me in the nightWith breasts shiningLike Venus and like Mars?The night that is shouting JasonWhen the loud eaves rattleAs with waves above meBlue at the prow of my desire!O prayers in the dark!O incense to Poseidon!Calm in Atlantis. I HEAR AN ARMY JAMES JOYCE I hear an army charging upon the land,And the thunder of horses plunging; foam about theirknees:Arrogant, in black armour, behind them stand,Disdaining the rains, with fluttering whips, the Char- ioteers.tThey cry into the night their battle name:I moan in sleep when I hear afar their whirlinglaughter.They cleave the gloom of dreams, a blinding flame,Clanging, clanging upon the heart as upon an anvil.They come shaking in triumph their long grey hair:They come out of the sea and run shouting by theshore.My heart, have you no wisdom thus to despair?My love, my love, my love, why have you left mealone ? A'OPIA EZRA POUND Be in me as the eternal moodsof the bleak wind, and notAs transient things are—gaiety of flowers.Have me in the strong lonelinessof sunless cliffsAnd of grey waters.Let the gods speak softly of usIn days hereafter,The shadowy flowers of OrcusRemember Thee. THE RETURN EZRA POUND See, they return; ah, see the tentativeMovements, and the slow feet,The trouble in the pace and the uncertainWavering!See, they return, one, and by one,With fear, as half-awakened;As if the snow should hesitateAnd murmur in the windand half turn back;These were the aWing'd-with-Awe,"Inviolable.Gods of the winged shoe!With them the silver houndssniffing the trace of air!Haie! Haie!These were the swift to harry;These the keen-scented;These were the souls of blood.Slow on the leash,pallid the leash-men! AFTER CH'U YUAN EZRA POUND I will get me to the woodWhere the gods walk garlanded in wisteria,By the silver-blue flood move others with ivory cars.There come forth many maidensto gather grapes for the leopards, my friend.For there are leopards drawing the cars.I will walk in the glade,I will come out of the new thicketand accost the procession of maidens. LIU CH'E EZRA POUND. The rustling of the silk is discontinued,Dust drifts over the courtyard,There is no sound of footfall, and the leavesScurry into heaps and lie still,And she the rejoicer of the heart is beneath them:A wet leaf that clings to the threshold. FAN-PIECE FOR HER IMPERIAL LORD EZRA POUND O fan of white silk,clear as frost on the grass-blade,You also are laid aside. TS'AI CHI'H EZRA POUND. The petals fall in the fountain,the orange coloured rose-leaves,Their ochre clings to the stone. IN THE LITTLE OLD MARKET-PLACE(To the Memory of A. V.) FORD MADOX HUEFFER It rains, it rains,From gutters and drainsAnd gargoyles and gables:It drips from the tablesThat tell us the tolls upon grains,Oxen, asses, sheep, turkeys and fowlsSet into the rain-soaked wallOf the old Town Hall.The mountains being so tallAnd forcing the town on the river,The market's so smallThat, with the wet cobbles, dark arches and all,The owls(For in dark rainy weather the owls fly outWell fyefore four), so the owlsIn the gloomHave too little roomAnd brush by the saint on the fountainIn veering about.The poor saint on the fountain!Supported by plaques of the giverTo whom we're beholden;His name was de SalesAnd his wife's name von Mangel. (Now is he a saint or archangel?)He stands on a dragonOn a ball, on a columnGazing up at the vines on the mountain:And his falchion is goldenAnd his wings are all golden.He bears golden scalesAnd in spite of the coils of his dragon, without hintof alarm or invectiveLooks up at the mists on the mountain.(Now what saint or archangelStands winged on a dragon,Bearing golden scales and a broad bladed sword allgolden ?Alas, my knowledgeOf all the saints of the college,Of all these glimmering, oldenSacred and misty storiesOf angels and saints and old glories . . .Is sadly defective.)The poor saint on the fountain . . .On top of his columnGazes up sad and solemn.But is it towards the top of the mountainWhere the spindrifty haze isThat he gazes?Or is it into the casementWhere the girl sits sewing?There's no knowing. Hear it rain!And from eight leaden pipes in the ball he stands onThat has eight leaden and copper bands on,There gurgle and drainEight driblets of water down into the basin.And he stands on his dragonAnd the girl sits sewingHigh, very high in her casementAnd before her are many geraniums in a parketAll growing and blowingIn box upon boxFrom the gables right down to the basementWith frescoes and carvings and paint . . .The poor saint!It rains and it rains,In the market there isn't an ox,And in all the emplacementFor waggons there isn't a waggon,Not a stall for a grape or a raisin,Not a soul in the marketSave the saint on his dragonWith the rain dribbling down in the basin,And the maiden that sews in the casement.They are still and alone,Mutterseelens alone,And the rain dribbles down from his heels and hiscrown, From wet stone to wet stone.It's grey as at dawn,And the owls, grey and fawn,Call from the little town hallWith its arch in the wall,Where the fire-hooks are stored. ,From behind the flowers of her casementThat's all gay with the carvings and paint,The maiden gives a great yawn,But the poor saint—No doubt he's as bored!Stands still on his columnUplifting his swordWith never the ease of a yawnFrom wet dawn to wet dawn . . . SCENTED LEAVES FROM A CHINESE JAR ALLEN UPWARD THE BITTER PURPLE WILLOWS Meditating on the glory of illustrious lineage I liftedup my eyes and beheld the bitter purple willows grow- ing round the tombs of the exalted Mings. THE GOLD FISH Like a breath from hoarded musk,Like the golden fins that moveWhere the tank's green shadows part—Living flames out of the dusk—Are the lightning throbs of loveIn the passionate lover's heart. THE INTOXICATED, POET A poet, having taken the bridle off his tongue, spokethus: "More fragrant than the heliotrope, whichblooms all the year round, better than vermilion letterson tablets of sendal, are thy kisses, thou shy one!" THE JONQUILS I have heard that a certain princess, when she foundthat she had been married by a demon, wove a wreathof jonquils and sent it to the lover of former days. THE MERMAID The sailor boy who leant over the side of the Junkof Many Pearls, and combed the green tresses of thesea with his ivory fingers, believing that he had heardthe voice of a mermaid, cast his body down betweenthe waves. THE MIDDLE KINGDOM The emperors of fourteen dynasties, clad in robes ofyellow silk embroidered with the Dragon, wearing golddiadems set with pearls and rubies, and seated onthrones of incomparable ivory, have ruled over theMiddle Kingdom for four thousand years. THE MILKY WAY My mother taught me that every night a processionof junks carrying lanterns moves silently across thesky, and the water sprinkled from their paddles fallsto the earth in the form of dew. Ino longer believethat the stars are junks carrying lanterns, no longerthat the dew is shaken from their oars. THE SEA-SHELL To the passionate lover, whose sighs come back tohim on every breeze, all the world is like a murmuringsea-shell. THE SWALLOW TOWER Amid a landscape flickering with poplars, and nettedby a silver stream, the Swallow Tower stands in thehaunts of the sun. The winds out of the four quartersof heaven come to sigh around it, the clouds forsakethe zenith to bathe it with continuous kisses. Againstits sun-worn walls a sea of orchards breaks in whitefoam; and from the battlements the birds that flitbelow are seen like fishes in a green moat. The win- dows of the Tower stand open day and night; thewinged Guests come when they please, and hold com- munication with the unknown Keeper of the Tower. THE ROSE JOHN COURNOS after K. TETMAIER I remember a day when I stood on the sea shore atNice, holding a scarlet rose in my hands.The calm sea, caressed by the sun, was brightlygarmented in blue, veiled in gold, and violet, vergingon silver.Gently the waves lapped the shore, and scatter- ing into pearls, emeralds and opals, hastened towardsmy feet with a monotonous, rhythmical sound, like theprolonged note of a single harp-string.High in the clear, blue-golden sky hung the great,burning disc of the sun.White seagulls hovered above the waves, nowbarely touching them with their snow-white breasts,now rising anew into the heights, like butterflies overthe green meadows . . .Far in the east, a ship, trailing its smoke, glidedslowly from sight as though it had foundered in thewaste.I threw the rose into the sea, and watched it,caught in the wave, receding, red on the snow-whitefoam, paler on the emerald wave.And the sea continued to return it to me, againand again, at last no longer a flower, but strewn petalson restless water.So with the heart, and with all proud things. Inthe end nothing remains but a handful of petals ofwhat was once a proud flower . . . DOCUMENTS TO HULME (T. E.)

What shall be said of him, this cock-o'-hoop ?(I'm just a trifle bored, dear God of mine,Dear unknown God, dear chicken-pox of Heaven,I'm bored I say), But still—my social friend—(One has to be familiar in one's discourse)While he was puffing out his jets of witOver his swollen-bellied pipe, one thinks,One thinks, you know, of quite a lot of things.(Dear unknown God, dear, queer-faced God,Queer, queer, queer, queer-faced God,You blanky God, be quiet for half minute,And when I've shut up Rates, and sat on Naboth,I'll tell you half a dozen things or so.)There goes a flock of starlings—Now half a dozen )rears ago,(Shut up, you blighted God, and let me speak)I should have hove my sporting air-gun upAnd blazed away—and now I let 'em go—It's odd how one changes;Yes, that's High Germany.But still, when he was smiling like a Chinese queen,Looking as queer (I do assure you, God)As any Chinese queen I ever saw;And tiddle-whiddle-whiddling about prose,Trying to quiz a mutton-headed poetaster, And choking all the time with politics—Why then I say, I contemplated himAnd marveled (God! I marveled,Write it in prose, dear God. Yes, in red ink.)And marveled, as I said,At the stupendous quantity of mindAnd the amazing quality thereof.Dear God of mine,It's really most amazing, doncherknow,But really, God, I can't get off the mark;Look here, you queer-faced God,This fellow makes me sick with all his talk,His ha'penny gibes at Celtic bardsAnd followers of Dante—honest folk!—Because, dear God, the rotten beggar goesAnd makes a Chinese blue-stockingFrom half-digested dreams of Munich-air.And then—God, why should I write it down?—But Rates and NabothAren't half such silly fools as he is (God)For they are frankly asinine,While he pretends to sanity,Modernity, (dear God, dear God).It's bad enough, dear God of mine,That you have set me down in London town,Endowed me with a tattered velvet coat,Soft collar and black hat and Greek ambitions;You might have left me there. But now you sendThis "vates" here, this sage social reformer(Yes, God, you rotten Roman Catholic)To put his hypothetical conceptionsOf what a poor young poetaster would thinkInto his own damned shape, and then to attack itTo his own great contemplative satisfaction.What have I done, O God,That so much bitterness should flop on me?Social Reformer! That's the beggar's name.He'd have me write bad novels like himself.Yes, God, I know it's after closing time;And yes, I know I've smoked his cigarettes;But watch that sparrow on the fountain in the rain.How half a dozen years ago,(Shut up, you blighted God, and let me speak)I should have hove my sporting air-gun upAnd blazed away—and now I let him go—It's odd how one changes;Yes, that's High Germany.

DES IMAGISTESAN ANIHOLOGY POETRYA MAGAZINE OF VERSEs . . . ', .. .) . ,v' '• ■ .Edited by Harriet Monroe, 543 Cass St., Chicago, 111. POETRY, at the end of its first year, is no longer an experi-ment but an assured artistic success, a publication whoseimportance is authoritatively recognized, not only in this) tcountry, but in Great Britain and France as well. Thefield it has opened up is full of brilliant possibilities, en-couraging the editors to hope for the enthusiastic sup-port of a discriminating public.POETRY endeavors to present the best verse now beingwritten in English, quality alone being the test of ac-ceptance.POETRY is an effort to create an organ for the art. Whilethe ordinary magazines must minister to a large publiclittle interested in poetry, this magazine appeals to andwill develop a public primarily interested in poetry asan art, potentially the highest, most complete human ex-pression of truth and beaut}'-. Thus it offers to poets aV 1chance to be heard by their own audience, in their ownd kplace, without the limitations imposed by the popularmagazines. And to lovers of poetry it offers each montha sheaf of new verse in delicate form uninterrupted byprose articles demanding a different mood.i i I l.If You Love Good Poetry, Subscribe—POETRY543 Cass Street, Chicago.i 4 v * ' 1 ; ' ' „&lt; .Send POETRY for one year ($1.50 enclosed) beginning.. - * " 4 \,. toName .'.Address THE INTERCOLLEGIATE SOCIALISTThought-Compelling, Admirably Written Quarterlyof Socialism and the Socialist MovementAmong the year's contributors are:Karl Kautsky, Jean Longuet, Keir Hardie, Morris Hillquit,Alexander Irvine, Helen L.
