Each issue will be devoted exclusively to one individual, thereby giving him an opportunity to present his work in sufficient bulk tomake it possible for the reader to obtain a muchmore comprehensive grasp of his personality than isafforded him in the restricted space allotted by theother magazines. Published monthly, or more frequently if possible, THE GLEBE will issue twelveto twenty books per year, chosen on their meritsalone, since the subscription list does away with theneed of catering to the popular demand that confronts every publisher. Thus, THE GLEBE canpromise the best work of American and foreignauthors, known and unknown.The price of each issue of THE GLEBE will varywith the cost of publication, but the yearly subscription, including special numbers, is three dollars. LOVE OF ONE'S NEIGHBOR LOVE OF ONE'S NEIGHBOR BYLEONID ANDREYEV LOVE OF ONE'S NEIGHBOR SCENE. A wild place in the mountains.(A man in an attitude of despair is standing on atiny projection of a rock that rises almost sheerfrom the ground. How he got there it is not easy tosay; but he cannot be reached either from above orbelow. Short ladders, ropes and sticks show thatattempts have been made to save the unknown per- son, but without success.It seems that the unhappy man has been in thatdesperate position a long time. A considerable crowdhas already collected, extremely varied in composi- tion. There are venders of cold drinks; there is awhole little bar behind zvhich the bartender skipsabout out of breath and perspiring—he has moreon his hands than he can attend to; there are peddlersselling picture postal cards; coral beads, souvenirs;and all sorts of trash. One fellow is stubbornly try- ing to dispose of a tortoise-shell comb, zvhich isreally not tortoise-shell. Tourists keep pouring from all sides, attracted by the report that a catas- trophe is impending—Englishmen, Americans, Ger- mans, Russians, Frenchmen, Italians, etc., with alltheir peculiar national traits of character, mannerand dress. Nearly all carry alpenstocks, field-glassesand cameras. The conversation is in different lan- guages, all of which, for the convenience of thereader, we shall translate into English.At the foot of the rock where the unknown manis to fall, two policemen are chasing the childrenaway and partitioning off a space, drawing a ropearound short stakes stuck in the ground. It is noisyand jolly.)POLICEMAN. Get away, you loafer! The man'llfall on your head and then your mother and fatherwill be making a hullabaloo about it.BOY. Will he fall here?POLICEMAN. Yes, here.BOY. Suppose he drops farther ?SECOND POLICEMAN. The boy is right. Hemay get desperate and jump, land beyond the ropeand hit some people in the crowd. I guess he weighsat least about two hundred pounds.FIRST POLICEMAN. Move on, move on, you!Where are you going ? Is that your daughter, lady ?Please take her away! The young man will soonfall. LADY. Soon? Did you say he is going to fallsoon? Oh, heavens, and my husband's not here!LITTLE GIRL. He's in the cafe, mamma.LADY (desperately). Yes, of course. He's al- ways in the cafe. Go call him, Nellie. Tell him theman will soon drop. Hurry! Hurry!VOICES. Waiter! Gargon Kellner—Threebeers out here!—No beer?—What?—Say, that's afine bar—We'll have some in a moment—Hurryup—Waiter!—Waiter!—Gargon!FIRST POLICEMAN. Say, boy, you're here again?BOY. I wanted to take the stone away.POLICEMAN. What for ?BOY. SO he shouldn't get hurt so badly when hefalls.SECOND POLICEMAN. The boy is right. Weought to remove the stone. We ought to clear theplace altogether. Isn't there any sawdust or sandabout ?(Two English tourists enter. They look at theunknown man through field-glasses and exchangeremarks.)FIRST TOURIST. He's young.SECOND TOURIST. How old?FIRST TOURIST. Twenty-eight.SECOND TOURIST. Twenty-six. Fright has madehim look older. FIRST TOURIST. HOW much will you bet?SECOND TOURIST. Ten to a hundred. Put itdown.FIRST TOURIST (writing in his note-hook. Tothe policeman). How did he got up there? Whydon't they take him off?POLICEMAN. They tried, but they couldn't. Ourladders are too short.SECOND TOURIST. Has he been here long?POLICEMAN. TWO days.FIRST TOURIST. Aha! He'll drop at night.SECOND TOURIST. In two hours. A hundred toa hundred.FIRST TOURIST. Put it down. (He shouts tothe man on the rock.) How are you feeling?What ? I can't hear you.UNKNOWN MAN (in a scarcely audible voice).Bad, very bad.LADY. Oh, heavens, and my husband is nothere!LITTLE GIRL (running in). Papa said he'll gethere in plenty of time. He's playing chess.LADY. Oh, heavens! Nellie, tell him he mustcome. I insist. But perhaps I had rather— Willhe fall soon, Mr. Policeman? No? Nellie, yougo. I'll stay here and keep the place for papa.(A tallj lanky woman of unusually independent and military appearance and a tourist dispute for thesame place. The tourist, a short, quiet, rather weakman, feebly defends his rights; the woman is reso- lute and aggressive.)TOURIST. But, lady, it is my place. I have beenstanding here for two hours.MILITARY WOMAN. What do I care how longyou have been standing here. I want this place. Doyou understand? It offers a good view, and that'sjust what I want. Do you understand?TOURIST {weakly). It's what I want, too.MILITARY WOMAN. I beg your pardon, whatdo you know about these things anyway ?TOURIST. What knowledge is required ? A manwill fall. That's all.MILITARY WOMAN ( mim). "A man willfall. That's all." Won't you have the goodness totell me whether you have ever seen a man fall?No? Well, I did. Not one, but three. Two acro- bats, one rope-walker and three aeronauts.TOURIST. That makes six.MILITARY WOMAN (mimicking). "That makessix." Say, you are a mathematical prodigy. Anddid you ever see a tiger tear a woman to pieces in azoo, right before your eyes? Eh? What? Yes,exactly. Now, I did— Please! Please!(The tourist steps aside, shrugging his shoulders with an air of injury,and the woman tri- umphantly takes possession of the stone she has wonby her prowess. She sits down, spreading outaround her her bag, handkerchiefs, peppermints,and medicine bottle, takes off her gloves and wipesher field-glass, glancing pleasantly on all around.Finally she turns to the lady who is waiting for herhusband in the cafe.)MILITARY WOMAN (amiably). You will tireyourself out, dear. Why don't you sit down?LADY. Oh, my, don't talk about it. My legs areas stiff as that rock there.MILITARY WOMAN. Men are so rude now- adays. They will never give their place to a woman.Have you brought peppermints with you ?LADY ( frightened). No. Why? Is it neces- sary ?MILITARY WOMAN. When you keep looking upa long time you are bound to get sick. Sure thing.Have you spirits of ammonia? No? Good gra- cious, how thoughtless! How will they bring youback to consciousness when he falls? You haven'tany smelling salts either, I dare say. Of course not.Have you anybody to take care of you, seeing thatyou are so helpless yourself ?LADY (frightened).l will tell my husband. Heis in the cafe. MILITARY WOMAN. Your husband is a brute.POLICEMAN. Whose coat is this? Who threwthis rag here?BOY. It's mine. I spread my coat there so thathe doesn't hurt himself so badly when he falls.POLICEMAN. Take it away.(Two tourists armed with cameras contendingfor the same position.)FIRST TOURIST. I wanted this place.SECOND TOURIST. YOU wanted it, but I got it.FIRST TOURIST. YOU just came here. I havehad this place for two days.SECOND TOURIST. Then why did you go with- out even leaving your shadow ?FIRST TOURIST. I wasn't going to starve myselfto death.COMB-VENDER (mysteriously). Tortoise-shell.TOURIST (savagely ). Well ?VENDOR. Genuine tortoise-shell.TOURIST. GO to the devil.THIRD TOURIST, PHOTOGRAPHER. For heaven'ssake, lady, you're sitting on my camera!LITTLE LADY. Oh! Where is it?TOURIST. Under you, under you, lady.LITTLE LADY. lam so tired. What a wretchedcamera you have. I thought it felt uncomfortable and I was wondering why. Now I know; I amsitting on your camera.TOURIST (agonized). Lady!LITTLE LADY. I thought it was a stone. I sawsomething lying there and I thought: A queer-look- ing stone; I wonder why it's so black. So that'swhat it was; it was your camera. I see.TOURIST (agonized). Lady, for heaven's sake!LITTLE LADY. Why is it so large, tell me.Cameras are small, but this one is so large. I swearI never had the faintest suspicion it was a camera.Can you take my picture ? I would so much like tohave my picture taken with the mountains here for abackground, in this wonderful setting.TOURIST. HOW can I take your picture if youare sitting on my camera?LITTLE LADY (jumping up, . Is itpossible? You don't say so. Why didn't you tellme so ? Does it take pictures ?VOICES. Waiter, one beer!—What did youbring wine for?—I gave you my order long ago.—What will you have, sir?—One minute.—In asecond. Waiter!—W aiter—Toothpicks!—(A fat tourist enters in haste, panting, sur- rounded by a numerous family.)TOURIST (crying). Mary! Aleck! Jimmie!—Where is Mary? For God's sake! Where is Mary? STUDENT {dismally). Here she is, papa.TOURIST. Where is she? Mary!GIRL. Here I am, papa.TOURIST. Where in the world are you? {Heturns around.) Ah, there! What are you standingback of me for? Look, look! For goodness sake,where are you looking?GIRL {dismally). I don't know, papa.TOURIST. No, that's impossible. Imagine! Shenever once saw a lightning flash. She always keepsher eyes open as wide as onions, but the instant itflashes she closes them. So she never saw lightning,not once. Mary, you are missing it again. Thereit is! You see!STUDENT. She sees, papa.TOURIST. Keep an eye on her. {Suddenlydropping into tone of profound pity.) Ah, pooryoung man. Imagine! He'll fall from that highrock. Look, children, see how pale he is! Thatshould be a lesson to you how dangerous climbing is.STUDENT {dismally). He won't fall to-day,papa!SECOND GIRL. Papa, Mary has closed her eyesagain.FIRST STUDENT. Let us sit down, papa! Uponmy word, he won't fall to-day. The porter told meso. I can't stand it any more. You've been dragging us about every day from morning till nightvisiting art galleries.TOURIST. What's that? For whose benefit amI doing this? Do you think I enjoy spending mytime with a dunce ?SECOND GIRL. Papa, Mary is blinking her eyesagain.SECOND STUDENT. I can't stand it either. Ihave terrible dreams. Yesterday I dreamed of gar- gons the whole night long.TOURIST. Jimmie.FIRST STUDENT. I have gotten so thin I amnothing but skin and bones. I can't stand it anymore, father. I'd rather be a farmer, or tend pigs.TOURIST. Aleck.FIRST STUDENT. If he were really to fall—butit's a fake. You believe every lie told you! Theyall lie. Baedecker lies, too. Yes, your Baedeckerlies!MARY {dismally). Papa, children, he's begin- ning to fall.{The man on the rock shouts something downinto the crowd. There is general commotion.Voices, "Look, he's falling Field-glasses areraised,\ the photographers, violently agitated, clicktheir cameras; the policemen diligently clean theplace where he is to fall.) PHOTOGRAPHER. Oh, hang it! What is thematter with me? The devil! When a man's in ahurry—SECOND PHOTOGRAPHER. Brother, your camerais closed.PHOTOGRAPHER. The devil take it.VOICES. Hush! He's getting ready to fall.—No, he's saying something.—No, he's falling.—Hush!UNKNOWN MAN ON THE ROCK {faintly). Saveme! Save me!TOURIST. Ah, poor young man. Mary, Jimmie,there's a tragedy for you. The sky is clear, theweather is beautiful, and has he to fall and be shat- tered to death? Can you realize how dreadful thatis, Aleck?STUDENT {wearily). Yes, I can realize it.TOURIST. Mary, can you realize it? Imagine.There is the sky. There are people enjoying them- selves and partaking of refreshments. Everythingis no nice and pleasant, and he has to fall. What atragedy! Do you remember Hamlet ?SECOND GIRL {prompting). Hamlet, Prince ofDenmark, of Alsinore.JA MES. Of Helsingfors, I know. Don't botherme, father! MARY {dismally). He dreamed about gargonsall night long.ALECK. Why don't you order sandwiches,father.COMB-VENDER {mysteriously). Tortoise-shell.Genuine tortoise-shell.TOURIST ( credulously ). Stolen ?VENDOR. Why, sir, the idea!TOURIST {angrily). Do you mean to tell me it'sgenuine if it isn't stolen? Go on. Not much.MILITARY WOMAN {amiably). Are all theseyour children?TOURIST. Yes, madam. A father's duty. Yousee, they are protesting. It is the eternal conflictbetween fathers and children. Here is such atragedy going on, such a heart-rending tragedy—Mary, you are blinking your eyes again.MILITARY WOMAN. YOU are quite right. Chil- dren must be hardened to things. But why do youcall this a terrible tragedy? Every roofer, when hefalls, falls from a great height. But this here—whatis it? A hundred, two hundred feet. I saw a manfall plumb from the sky.TOURIST {overwhelmed). You don't say?ALECK. Children, listen. Plumb from the sky.MILITARY WOMAN. Yes, yes. I saw an aero- naut drop from the clouds and go crash upon aniron roof.TOURIST. HOW terrible!MILITARY WOMAN. That's what I call a tragedy.It took two hours to bring me back to consciousness,and all that time they pumped water on me, thescoundrels. I was nearly drowned. From that dayon I never step out of the door without taking spiritsof ammonia with me.( Enter a strolling troop of Italian singers andmusicians: a short, fat tenor, with a reddish heardand large, watery, stupidly dreamy eyes, singingwith extraordinary sweetness; a skinny humpbackwith a jockey cap, and a screeching baritone; a basswho is also a mandolinist, looking like a bandit; agirl with a violin, closing her eyes when she plays,so that only the whites are seen. They take theirstand and begin to sing: iCSuI mare lucica—SantaLucia, Santa Lucia—")MARY {dismally). Papa, children, look. He isbeginning to wave his hands.TOURIST. IS that the effect the music has uponhim?MILITARY WOMAN. Quite possible. Musicusually goes with such things. But that'll make himfall sooner than he should. Musicians, go awayfrom here! Go! (A tall tourist, with up-curled mustache, vio- lently gesticulating, enters, followed by a smallgroup attracted by curiosity.)TALL TOURIST. It's scandalous. Why don'tthey save him ? Ladies and gentlemen, you all heardhim shout: "Save me." Didn't you?THE CURIOUS {in chorus). Yes, yes, we heardhim.TALL TOURIST. There you are. I distinctlyheard these words: "Save me! Why don't theysave me?" It's scandalous. Policemen, policemen!Why don't you save him? What are you doingthere ?POLICEMEN. We are cleaning up the place forhim to fall.TALL TOURIST. That's a sensible thing to do,too. But why don't you save him? You ought tosave him. If a man asks you to save him, it is ab- solutely essential to save him. Isn't it so, ladies andgentlemen ?THE CURIOUS (in chorus). True, absolutelytrue. It is essential to save him.TALL TOURIST (with heat). We are notheathens, we are Christians. We should love ourneighbors. When a man asks to be saved everymeasure which the government has at its command should be taken to save him. Policemen, have youtaken every measure ?POLICEMAN. Every one!TALL TOURIST. Every one without exception?Gentleman, every measure has been taken. Listen,young man, every measure has been taken to saveyou. Did you hear?UNKNOWN MAN {in a scarcely audible voice).Save me!TALL TOURIST {excitedly). Gentlemen, did youhear? He again asked to be saved. Policemen,did you hear?ONE OF THE CURIOUS {timidly). It is myopinion that it is absolutely necessary to save him.TALL TOURIST. That's right. Exactly. Why,that's what I have been saying for the last twohours. Policemen, do you hear? It is scandalous.ONE OF THE CURIOUS {a little bolder). It is myopinion that an appeal should be made to the high- est authority.THE REST {in chorus). Yes, yes, a complaintshould be made. It is scandalous. The governmentought not to leave any of its citizens in danger. Weall pay taxes. He must be saved.TALL TOURIST. Didn't I say so? Of coursewe must put up a complaint. Young man! Listen, young man. Do you pay taxes? What? I can'thear.TOURIST. Jimmie, Katie, listen! What atragedy! Ah, the poor young man! He is soon tofall and they ask him to pay a domiciliary tax.KATE (the girl with glaspedantically). Thatcan hardly be called a domicile, father. The mean- ing of domicile is—JAMES (pinching her). Lickspittle.MARY {wearily). Papa, children, look! He'sagain beginning to fall.{There is excitement in the crowd, and again ahustling and shouting among the photographers.)TALL TOURIST. We must hurry, ladies andgentlemen. He must be saved at any cost. Who'sgoing with me ?THE CURIOUS {in chorus). We are all going!We are all going?TALL TOURIST. Policemen, did you hear?Come, ladies and gentlemen!{They depart, fiercely gesticulating. The cafegrows more lively. The sound of clinking beerglasses and the clatter of steins is heard, and the he- ginning of aloud German song. The bartender, zvhohas forgotten himself while talking somebody,starts suddenly and runs off, looks up to the skywith a hopeless air and wipes the perspiration from his face with his napkin. Angry calls of Waiter!Waiter!)UNKNOWN MAN (rather loudly). Can you letme have some soda water?( The waiter is startled, looks at the sky, glancesat the man on the rock, and pretending not to haveheard him, walks away.)MANY VOICES. Waiter! Beer!WAITER.

Say, what are youtalking about ? How can he get a drink ? The manis about to die and you tempt him and try to gethim excited. Listen, up there, we have been drink- ing your health right along. It won't hurt you,will it?FIRST DRUNKEN MAN. Ah, go on! What areyou talking about ? How can it hurt him ? Why. it will only do him good. It will encourage him.Listen, honest to God, we are very sorry for you,but don't mind us. We are going to the cafe tohave another drink. Good-bye.SECOND DRUNKEN MAN. Look, what a crowd.FIRST DRUNKEN MAN. Come, or he'll fall andthen they'll close the cafe.{Enter a new crowd of tourists, a very elegantgentleman, the chief correspondent of Europeannewspapers at their head. He is followed by anecstatic whisper of respect and admiration. Manyleave the cafe to look at him, and even the waiterturns slightly around, glances at him quickly, smileshappily and continues on his way, spilling somethingfrom his tray.)VOICES.

PC) E T R YA MAGAZINE OF VERSEEdited by Harriet Monroe, 543 Cass St., Chicago, 111. POETRY, at the end of its first year, is no longer an experi-ment but an assured artistic success, a publication whoseimportance is authoritatively recognized, not only in thiscountry, but in Great Britain and France as well. Thefield it has opened up is full of brilliant possibilities, en-couraging the editors to hope for the enthusiastic sup-port of a discriminating public.POETRY endeavors to present the best verse now beingwritten in English, quality alone being the test of ac-ceptance.POETRY is an effort to create an organ for the art. Whilethe ordinary magazines must minister to a large publiclittle interested in poetry, this magazine appeals to andwill develop a public primarily interested in poetry asan art, potentially the highest, most complete human ex-pression of truth and beauty. Thus it offers to poets achance to be heard by their own audience, in their ownplace, without the limitations imposed by the popularmagazines. And to lovers of poetry it offers each montha sheaf of new verse in delicate form uninterrupted byprose articles demanding a different mood.If You Love Good Poetry, Subscribe—POETRY543 Cass Street, Chicago.Send POETRY for one year ($1.50 enclosed) beginningtoNameAddress THE INTERCOLLEGIATE SOCIALISTThought-Compelling, Admirably Written Quarterlyof Socialism and the Socialist MovementAmong the year's contributors are:Karl Kautsky, Jean Longuet, Keir Harclie, Morris Hillquit,Alexander Irvine, Helen L.
