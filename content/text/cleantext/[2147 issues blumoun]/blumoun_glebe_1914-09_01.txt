POEMS POEMS GEORGE W. CRONYN To touch the sleeping lids of BeautyDrawing thru finger-tips her dream—a birthOf hell and heaven for a nobler earth;This is the poet's duty.To sleep with stars, to dream a flower,From passing shadows pluck profound relation,With a divine wonder at its emanation;This is the poet's power. DIONYSUS ELEUTHERIOS THE PRAYER Like a cat beside a poolMore than half afraid of it,Fishing gingerly I sitHere beside this pool of wit—Dumb as any fool!Chirrups humor in the grass;Winds of tickling laughter pass,And the world grows wise forsooth,Lets gleam amused toothSeeing in this water-glassJests that swim the depths of truth,And like fins of fishes shiverIt to fretful quirk and quiver.Ripples break and bubbles riseCatching smiles from out the skiesIn their globed eyes.Surely, surely there was neverSuch a pleasant river!Only I am out of tuneLike an icicle in June,Or a monster from the moon.Dionysus, hear my prayer!Spreading arms to the mute air,I entreat thee, fashion meOne with this gay company, One in mirth and one in songDartling their minds among.Loosener of lips and heart,Draw my sullen mouth apart.Give a gleam to guide me byAs a phare in a night-sky—Grace of tongue and warmth of eye;Give me of thy fire and dew;Give me flash of mimic art—Spice of Godhead in this brewTo pierce my fellows thru and thru.Oh, thou vintal Deity, ,Loose my limbs that they may flyWith this reckless revelry!Sick of sober ways am I;In this tumult I aloneAm a satyr turned to stone;Satyr—satyr—not a man!Gifts I ask not of Apollo—Wine is good and grief is hollow;I would follow after Pan;I would follow, follow, followAfter Pan!Or if he wander ways too quiet,Shepherd ways of warmth and ease,Let me taste a wilder riotIn thy mysteries—Let me quaff it, laugh it, cry it!Give me, give me, give me these— Fleet foot after those that flee,Hot veins amorous to seizeMaenads maddened by the wine,Wound with hair and wreathed with vine,Maenads stained with purple lees—Give me, give me, give me these.Only this I ask of theeDionysus, Dionysus, son of Semele! THE ANSWER Lo! the God of purple pleasureHeard and hearkened to his prayer,Reft the swathed bands that bound him,From his cloak of Self unwound him,Filled him with supernal seizureThat his humor's jewelled treasureLeaped and sparkled in the air—Till the night was bright around him.Never such a jestful fitDreamt he in his wildest wishes!Never from the pool of witHad he drawn such shining fishes !Humid flame glowed in each eyeAnd his face had changed its vesture,And his arms moved with strange gestureApt in every mimicry.With the spell of Fire and DewHe pierced his fellows thru and thru.Surely Dithyrambus pressed him! Surely the Great God possessed him!And the mystic sisters too,Oeno, Spermo, and Elais,(Who knoweth what their way is?)Surely they caressed him!He whose tongue of old was frozen—As he quaffs, with this potationDeep and deeper inspirationSeems to grow a Prophet—chosen,For he speaks by divination!Never were such fancies wovenFrom the carded thoughts of mortal.Some are mazed, and some deride him,"Lo, his wits have gone astray,What a fool he is!" they say.Others whisper (those beside him)"He hath crossed another portal—He is one whose foot is cloven.Do ye hear wild creatures beatLifted hoof and naked feetOn the quiet woodland sod?Do ye mark what mood that strain is ?Hints it not the Shepherd GodWith his pipings shrill and sweet—Snubnose, Sweetwine, old Silenus,All his creatures shy and fleet?"Deeper, deeper, Fire and DewDrains he of the Wine-God's brewCraving furthest essence—thusHeareth now another voice Terrible and new,Luring—appalling,"lachus! lachus! lachus!Wine! Wine! Wine! Rejoice!"Thru the forest calling.And the sky is red and goldenAnd the red, red stars are falling,Falling to the earth in showers.And the fresh blood-scents emboldenGold and sable leopards, sleeping,To come crawling, writhing, leaping,Over gold and purple flowers.And the autumn sun is swollenWith the sweetness he has stolenFrom the wine, and he is wine, wine-red.Come ye now with wreathed head,Come ye nowWith ivy bound on your white brow,And forgotten, forgotten be the hours!Forgotten and forgotten! Ah the night has fled away,And the wine is spilt, and the stars are gray,For the old cold dawn abashesAll the torches turned to ashes,But the feasters—where are they?Fled, the sound of pipes at last;Fled, the panting, goat-shankid clan,And the maenad rout have passed,And the echoes caught and castDied where they began. Never, never, neverA more sombre riverFrom such springs of laughter ran!And the lucid pool of wit—What a scum has clouded it!Past each stately Parian columnDay comes, gaunt and pale and shrunkenAnd her step is very solemn.On the veined marble sunken,Reft of breath of Deity,Prone there, lies the Priest—-the Chosen,Huddled, bestial, bleared and drunken—Like a body that is frozen(That such things should be!)Shape of shapeless mockeryHe had tasted all one can;He had heard the pipes of Pan;He had followed in thy vanDionysus, Dionysus, son of Semele—•Satyr ?—not a satyrhhae—a man! THE TRAIL BY NIGHT No human foot-print here before my own!And it is strange to come so far—alone—So far into this frozen forest worldOf moonlight and of shadow and deep snow,And things I do not know,That strike the civil vestments from my soul—As if all law-born years were backward hurledToward some dim and other pole—Some brute primordial reignWhose voice was terror and whose life was pain.On—up the trail I go ;Beneath my feet cold streams of moonlight glow,And in the silver-sifted dark strange, naked fanciesgrow,While the vast pines in vista, round by round,Move with an unearthly sound,And every tree with its white hair is crowned.On—up—I go,And as thru ancient Gothic arches seenI glimpse the valley far belowThat glistens with a fine fantastic sheen.On—up—I pass,Nor reck the night-wrought spells about me thrown,Heedless—sucked dry of thought or willSave to peer curious into this magician's glass, And see the forest dreams thru forest moonlightblown.On—up I plunge—untilBending, discern before me, with a thrillThe signs where some wild beast has gone.Who knows but that within the silence hereThe cedar shadows gloom about a deer,That stands with body lithe and slimStruck to a statue by surprise ?Who knows but that, upon some snowy limbA lynx, lean-bellied, pricks his tufted earAnd watches me with evil, amber eyes?Surely beyond the stars my man-world lies—For close to me unhallowed mountains riseAnd fill my heart with fear! SONG IN WINTER Burning stars in a frosty sky,Thread-bare winds from the hollow west,"Give us a garment of beauty!" they cry,"For the waters of truth our throats are dry,And phantoms of chaos uncover the bones of ourbreast,Leaving us little rest."Bitter stars in a frozen sky,Tattered winds from the lonely west,Haggard beggars of hours that die—(Begging the gift of a golden lie!)Is it with you as with us, no rest, no rest—Is it with you no rest ? The lacy chequer of aerial boughsThat winter weaves with delicate wizardry Far away—who knows how far?—Against the flaming calm of winter twilight,I hear the voice of speed—muffled and hoarse,Sounding across the hills. Locomotive, locomotive,Over the hills at night,Running on your far-away grooveWith the husky pant of things that moveAnd cannot turn to left or right,Of things that toil and things that passIn the murk of smoke and the stench of gas,Serf of the monstrous city,What pity—oh what pityFor the dearth of your delight,Locomotive, locomotive,Over the hills at night! CLOUDS Whence do you come, oh silken shapes,Across the silver sky?We come from where the wind blowsAnd the young stars die.Why do you move so fast, so fastAcross the white moon's breast?The cruel wind is at our heelsAnd we may not rest.Are you not weary, fleeing shapes,That never cease to flee?The forked trees' chained shadows areLess weary than we.Whither do you go, O shadow-shapesAcross the ghastly sky?We go to where the wind blowsAnd the old stars die. My head is circl'd with fire—And I think of the failing of one's desire—And I hear outside the pitiful dropping of rain;Which is the greater pain?I yearn for the birth of the brain—Be it child of blood and pain,(I pray to* endure the pain)—My heart—lo! my heart is afireWith hue as of purple or Tyre—With hope of Promethean fire—And oh God! God! God! the desireFor what only the Gods attain!In the white moonlight standWith every finger on a star, and feelInfinity as an engulfing wave. JOY The canons are covered with snow,But the sky doth over them leanWith eyes that are warm and keenAs if he could never knowThe gray despair of the snow;And snow and sky join hands togetherTo dance a dance of wonderful weather! A VOICE A woman spoke to me in the street—I do not remember how or why—But a breath blew over the winter skyAnd spring came in with silver feet! ANOTHER A creature plucked at me in the streetBut well I knew the reason whyThe red stars sickened in the skyAnd Hell gaped open at my feet! IMPRESSIONS This is the Gate of the Gray City-—wroughtWith piled roofs and steeples dimly seenThru the gray dusk—pale, wistful flakes of fireKindled about its lower fringe—vast murk—A snuffling monster with an evil eyeThat surly pants to work some will unknown,Blowing white breaths—a semaphoreWith lifted arm—a form that swings a lightIn arcs, against infinitude of gray,Uneasy sounds, the clink and clank and groanOf things inanimate—the curves of railsIn rhythmical convergence gathered up—(And gathering up what burdens from afar!)Monotony—monotony—despair!This is the Gate of the Gray City. Whatever our immitigable end,The earth's our home and prison thru whose windowsOur wistful scrutinizing minds traverseThe sky's dissolving continents, exultIn melancholy mountains or, shackled,Envy the inconstant sea that seemsAn uncontaminated god, alone, completeIn mighty passion and the scorn of time. I love the skyward-spiring treeFor its supreme unconsciousness of me. So let us seek the lands that the Gods love,The soil unsown, the isles of sumptuous store;Where fallow fields yield yearly fee of grain,And vines unpruned produce perennial bloom,And olive slips engender faithfully,And dark figs deck their trees; the cavernous oaksBleed honey'd drops, and from high hills descendThe nimble waters with melodious feet. PRELUDE TO A PHANTASY I will tell thee of Far-Away, of Far-Away, ofFar-Away,I will tell thee of Far-AwayThe home of wandering dreams;For they come out of Far-AwayTo show us how to love and play,And when they've wandered for a dayMust return, it seems.There's more than gold in Far-Away, in Far-Away,in Far-Away,There's more than gold in Far-Away,There's more than jewelled gleams.There's more than smiles in Far-Away,And coronals of laughter gay;There's crystal tears that bloom alwayBeside forgotten streams.We'll gather gold from Far-Away, from Far-Away,from Far-Away,We'll gather gold from Far-Away,We'll steal the jewelled gleams.We'll hunt for smiles from Far-Away;Following laughter by the way,But we must for another dayLeave the tears it seems. We'll find the road to Far-Away, to Far-Away, toFar-Away,We'll know the road to Far-AwayBy the feet of dreams;For they come out of Far-AwayTo love a little and to play,And when they've wandered for a dayMust return it seems. RUNNING WATER Oh you who stand by the river in a gown of willow- green,I will make you an eager song of my heart to-night;I will find me a feather of a singing bird that has seenAnd touched the blue targe of the sky in its flight.I will make me a quill of it, and dip in my heart andwrite!I would not make you a threnody of sorrow that hasbeen,For you are no more than an eager child who demandMagical tales of me, of lacquered Arabian sheen;I will speak very softly then with your handIn mine, a rose petal, the things that you understand.On the waxen and beautiful tablet that is your heartWith a singing quill and the stain of my heart I willwrite;I will write with the simplest words and the simplestartAll the splendors that glow so by night—Of the Genie and the Bottle, and carpets of orientflight.And you who are more than a princess in your gownof yellow-greenWith your bird-like and trembling heart will under- stand All the luxurious sorrows and loves that have beenWritten on parchment at a king's demand—And the simple words of them will flutter like birdsin vour hand.* EPITHALAMION The pale dawn went down unto the sea,Past the gray ships in the offing.The salt wind found her blowing hairAnd closed his wings and nested there,And the salt sea hungered for her rareSweet body and forgot his scoffing.The pale dawn went down unto the seaWhen all the world was sleeping;She lifted veils and veils of airUntil her eager limbs were bare,And the salt sea shook his maned hair,And the curl'd waves came to her, leaping. MARSH-LANDS Sure in this spongy and luxuriant retreat—This lovely lyric little marshWhich nothing hath of fierce or harsh,Unhappy fancies to evoke,Where all life is most delicately attuned to sweetMelodious living, here we'll meetNaiads dainty and discreetWith other watery folkAnd watch the twinkle of their iridiscent feet.Upon a reed's high silver pointWhich early dews anoint,The Red-wing lights and poises, swaying,With throaty and delicious whistle playingPan-music in the mellow morning light.It is like running water's flowA bit unearthly, and celestial quite—A golden tremolo ;And satin robes of air half veil him from our sight.The gay marsh-marigoldDelights its small sun to unfold;And many a bulbous goblin thing,Ugly and grave,Into the dull mud burrowingDraws from some secret treasure-caveAnd to the sunlight heavesGreen breadth—great leavesTo build a vessel floating on an inland wave. We'll be as busy as the clouds, with naught to do,And we will wonder at the curious striping,In saffron glimpses, of more distant poolsWhich the wind coolsWith deep reflected blue.And we will listen now to Hyla's piping—A thin small spriteThat one may never seeCalling to the sky his clear delightFilled with insatiate and unbounded ecstasy. SPRING FANCY There is an orchard, old and rare,(I cannot tell you where!)With green doors opening to the sun;And the sky-children gather thereTo watch the blossoms, one by one,Falling wistfully thru the airFrom the trees' dishevelled hair.The sky-children shake their wingsWith flutterings and gurglings—And love the light and kiss the sun,Nor heed the blossoms that have blownFrom the fruit-wives' ancient hairEarthward thru the glowing air,Wistfully—one by one. SONG A Flicker, a Robin, a Song-sparrowHave come from Arcady.The Flicker was an imp that shouted in a tree;The Robin was a winged laugh that Spring set free;The Song-sparrow was a liquid arrowThat pierced to the heart of me. PLAYING Three little girls and one little boyOut in the first warm sunshine;The wind blows in and the wind blows outVoices cool as moonshine.Six tin cans and a pile of dirtAnd the air smiles like a mother—The wind blows in and the wind blows outAs they play with each other.Sparrows on the fence and clothes on the lineAnd somewhere someone's laughter—The wind blows in and the wind blows out.And it could not blow much softer!Three little girls and one little boyOut in the first warm weather—The wind blows in and the wind blows outWhile they play together. SONG Hi! hi! hi!On this green morningMy soul is as taut as a greenwood-bow,Feeling the sap in it mounting so,Needs but a jog to loose without warningAn arrow into the infinite sky—Hi! hi! hi!On this green morning! A BUST BY RODIN, KNOWN AS CERES With rhythmic feet and garments flowing freeDraw near, draw near, bring largesse in full hand;Move as to music of the sarabandStately, before this Woman-deity.Woman's—these billows of thick hair that rollDown the billowing breasts of her, and closeShadows of pain and mirth in firm repose—This delicate mask drawn tight across a soul!A Goddess—Ultima Thule in her eye;For the sad wisdom of its steady gaze,Fixed on far, wintry fields and frozen ways,Goes out to larger things than you or I:The Titan-sap makes gods of the spring hours,And Earth renews its children and its flowers! THE FLOWER'S WAY I have stood long in the nightUnder a star;I have stood still with shadowy headAnd arrowy leaves outspreadUnder its trembling lightWhere green things are.I have crept close to the grassWhere the beetles dart,And the humming-bird and the dragon-flyWere visions in the sky,And the mendicant bees that passRifled my heart.I have lain long in the dayUnder the sun,With my burning face in the arms of the wind,And my petals unconfin'dAnd my virginal robes a-sway—Thus joy is won! THE TREE'S WAY The high trees are honest folk;They do not stand so much aloofUp under heaven's roof,Altho they are earth's fairest cloak.Their lives are very calm and slow;They wait for coming things to come,They wait, they rest, they ponder somePurpose forgotten long agoLike quiet folk;And sometimes I am moved to strokeHand-greeting as I pass them near,And often I am sure I hearAn answer from these stately folk! CHILDREN What a garden of surpriseOut beyond my window lies!Fancy, when the night is thereGentle trees with drooping hairRocking, rocking cradle-wiseLittle stars with yellow eyes! VERSES TO A LITTLE CHILD(From Hofmannsthal) Your feet have been fashioned as rosesTo seek the lands of the rainbow—The rainbow-kingdoms are open.There, haunting the taciturn tree-topsMillenial prophecies linger,The inexhaustible watersAbide there forever and aye.Beside the immeasurable forestFrom wooden bowl brimming will you thenApportion your milk with a hop-toad?So festive a banqueting almostEntices the stars to their fall!By borders of measureless watersSoon you will discover a playmate,A dolphin engaging and kind.He'll leap to dry-land at your bidding,And if he shall fail you sometimesThe tender, innumerable zephyrsWill still your tempestuous sobbing.You'll find in the rainbow-kingdomThe ancient exalted traditionsForever and ever unchanged.The sun with mysterious powerHas fashioned your feet as the rosesTo enter his measureless kingdom. NIGHT-FLOWERS This night hath no disease;It knows not wrecks nor warsNor deaths of human minds.The feet of the sweet windsBreak all the river's peaceInto marmoreal bars.The tops of moonlit treesHave blossomed with white stars,And perfumes that one findsIn old Arabian jarsHad never blooms like these! THE NIGHT Sorrows confide their secrets; joys lead livesOf donely splendor. Mankind tells all thingsTo me, knowing I will not ever speak. DISILLUSION The night was like a jewell'd crown—(Could jewels be so soft a thing!)For stars and wind were in the townAnd by the highways entering,Plucked there as on a viol string,Until—somewhere—a woman's scream—Sharply shattered the dream! Silence withinThe upper twilight of a temple liesAsleep, with pendant plumes—a dreaming god—And dreams the pageantry of things—and dreamsThe gifts that he has given with his hands—The gifts that he has taken with his hands—And dreams his own eternity. I am one that lovesThe stars of labyrinthine night whom the shrill dawnDevours, the quietude of ultimate slopesThoughtful of twilight, peering moons that shedUnrisen glamours thru the umbrageous woodWith gnome and goblin rife, and the light sprayOf gray spring rains enveloping the hills. SONG Would I were a birdTo nest in a coverOf leaves that hover'Twixt earth and heavenWhere no sound is heard—Only the unevenBrush of winds that slumberWith no thought to cumber;Would I were a bird!Would I were a waveTo rise for a momentFrom the ocean's foment,To puff my lips asunderBlowing bubbles brave,To dream and to wonderOf the depths below meAnd the winds that blow me—Would I were a wave!Bird, canst thou fashionSong of things that grieve thee?Wave hast thou passionFor things that will deceive thee?Bird and wave I leave ye! RONDEAU A Sunday-calm, ornate, profound,Enchanting sense, subduing sound,Enjoins its ritual to prepare ;The day is bland with unctuous prayerThat leaps to heaven at a bound.And bells ope throats in mellow roundOf sweet antiphonal resound,And virtue glistens everywhere—A Sunday-calm.Draw breath! Away to virgin ground!But where the fields are flower-crownedThe cattle with self-conscious stareChide my undeprecative air,—Good heavens! Can they too have foundA Sunday-calm? SUNSET BURIAL The trees upheaven filigrane fingers of desireTo touch a ruby-throated cloud-face fannedBy a bronze breath and globous mouth of fire;Beneath, the rigid gravestones stand,Each one a cadaver that cannot close its hand. FAIRY SONG I can live in a golden fruitWhose core is hung with honey;I can swing on golden wingIn elfin ceremony—But oh! for the powerTo open as a flowerWhen the air is sunny! A YOUNG GIRL'S LOVE The season is less stubborn now;Over the youngling world we seeA white sky full of scudding blue,A white wind that runneth as a childTouching most delicately the newSweet buds, and having touched and smiled,Goes to seek out some pale anemone,And wreathe with maiden flowers her fragile brow. A YOUNG MAN'S LOVE If I were your sister I'd lie with you the night-longTo feel your bosom's beating;If I were your brother I'd wake you with a day-songAnd give a kiss as greeting;If I were your mother I'd hold you as a shut flowerWhen the dark comes creeping;If I were your father I'd enter at the dawn-hourTo look upon you, sleeping.What is there left overFor me, who am your lover? SONG A cup full of star-shineThat glowed as an ember,(Oh, star of my delight!)With smiles I do rememberAnd words forgotten quite,A cup full of star-shineI drank with you to-night.A cup full of sea-soundThat was as summer thunder—(Oh sea of my delight!)With love that lay underSeven heavens bright,A cup full of sea-soundI drank with you to-night. SONG(After an old English tune) I will bring thee a silver crown.I will bring thee an ell of vair,Cloth of gold and ermine rareTo make thee a gown.Thou hast brought me a marble frown.Thou hast brought me a cold, cold stare,Heart of lead and wry despair,And a mad-man's swown.I will bring thee a leaden crown,Cloth of Raines in thirty-fold!I will bring thee a bed on the woldTo lay thee down.Thou hast brought me out of the townTo the earth upturned where the bell is tolled—Fires of hell and the river's coldMy sorrows drown! TRISTAN AND ISOLDE The sea is here, it hath not any shore,Nor moves with moving of wind-driven wavesWhich, undulant and writhing—naked slavesTo the uneasy wanderer of heaven's floor,Bow sullen backs beneath their master's storeHe brought with viewless hands from broken graves—The sea is here, and in its silent cavesMoves not, tho the wind clamors more and more.The sea is here, an infinite undertone;But lo! upon its surface I descryTwo floating bubbles, wonderfully blownToward each other, flame-like from the sky—Meet—melt with lyric splendor into one—Then, wind-prick'd, vanish—o'er the Sea, a cry! PALINURUS Starlight: with deep and quiet breathing sleptThe southern sea. The white-wing'd ship that boreThe good Aeneas from his Dido's shoreGhostlike, with rippling furrows, onward crept,And only faithful Palinarus keptThe midnight watch—but ah, the magic bough,The opiate dew that dript upon his brow,The vacant post, the friends who waking wept.The gods demand their victims; who shall knowWhat failures Time and Circumstance compel?Yet, if such doom were mine, I would 'twere soThat they would mark my absence thus: "How wellEven unto the last he struggled, lo!He tore the rudder with him when he fell!" THE DERELICT I cannot remember whither I was bound—I cannot remember why I was foundMoving without a soundMoving in mystery—Derelict, derelict,Over the sea!I too carry a cargo in my hold,Underneath sea-water and green with mold—I cannot remember how old!For terrible it is to beDerelict, derelict,Over the sea!Feebler ships weather bravely into port;Running a course that is safe and short—My voyage is another sort;No master guideth me—Derelict, derelict,Over the sea!Nights have shadow'd me with phantom stride—Stars have peer'd at me, eerie-eyed—Goblin lights and magic tideKeep me company,Derelict, derelict,Over the sea! Setting suns have rowell'd me with crimson'd heel—Winds have flung laughter, peal after peal—But they shall not know that I feelMute in my agony—Derelict, derelict,Over the sea!Rudderless, by ways uncharted blown—Some day shall waken to find me gone—What matter? I have drifted aloneEver—alone—vet free—Derelict, derelict,Over the sea! THE SQUIRE OF DAMES TO HIS LADY Why should our meeting borrowA sense of shame or sorrowThat each must go his way ?Love liketh no fetterTherefore our roads were betterIf you go yours to-morrow,And I go mine to-day.I hold you for a minute—You'd catch the hour and pin it—But if I held you longerWould you have more assuranceIn days of richer durance,Life with more rapture in it,Passion more wise and stronger ?The Daughter of IllusionHath made our love seem fusionOf two strange things in one—But loving hath not taught herThat strange as fire to water,Love becomes bleak intrusionWhen all the glamor's gone.You say I've brought you sorrowAnd pay not debts I borrow—But mirth is what's to pay!So part our paths in laughter, And, since your heart is softer,You go your way to-morrow—And I'll go mine to-day. GAS-LIGHT HEROICS With this night's carousalWe will close the portalOn our poor espousal—Sacrament and houselFor a love too mortal!With this gay delayingWe'll delay yet longer—Care not what the sayingOf the World—that brayingEvil tattle-monger!Pleasure has as thunderScorched and jangled thru me;Now I'll sit and wonderAt the day-star yonderAnd your face, grown gloomy. You are known as "Lily"And they mock your gender;Is it but a sillyFancy, you seem stillyLily-souled and tender ?Underneath the bitterMockery of color,Underneath the titterIs there something fitter ?Something finer, fuller ?Something (can I hear itIn your secret eyes?)When I come too near itLike a frightened spiritRunning from the skies?Girl, you know that glow meantDawn's thin lips of scarlet—Bubble of life's fomentStay your soul a moment!• •••••Bah! You're drunk, you harlot! MISTS I I am most weary of this fatuous meThat doth obtrude a niddering death's headAt a blithe feast of Springtide jollity,Of revelling buds and flowers unsurfeited.I am most weary of this chained thoughtThat hath forgotten where its mansions are—And lost the dew its seven-spher'd courses caughtWandering in plunged dark from star to star.I am most weary of my stagnant soulThat neither thirsts, nor hungers, nor is stirredBy the gigantic thunders that have rolledFrom the white, hurtling lightning of a word.I am most weary, love; so let thy face—The sponge that sops my gaze, myself erase. II Oft in the groping night I am afraid,For this, mine opaque organism, seemsA glass, a mere reflex of trooping dreams—A polished boss where images parade.And to see these doth make my senses cold—•This globe become a visionary face—This little spinning soul of me—in space—I dare not think of what that space may hold!Such thoughts are as the charnel mists that riseFrom feverish and mortuary groundThru which one sees the country all around—Yet near, the dead—and far away, the skies.But at the thought of you my life expandsUntil it holds all life within its hands! SCEPTIC I This hour has shut us like a tentFrom all but night; we two, alone,So close, so poignantly alert, have grown,That trivial speech, from silence rent,Breaks off—a useless instrument.For all the opening world is ours,And you, tho scarce a woman yet,Your eyes with feasts of lights and vintage set,Hold all the dewy wealth of flowers,And gold of Babylonian towers.Our lives will alter if we move—It were so&lt; easy now to riseAnd tell my unimpassioned soul it lies—And claim youth's heritage of love,Let bald life prove what it may prove!It were so easy to conceiveYour lack my lack would compensate—And by one stroke undo the knot of fate;It were so easy to believeThe lies that such a thing could weave! Or shall I stumble through the nightBiting my lips to hold the tearsBecause your incommunicable yearsMust spend their summer of delightWithout my reach—beyond my sight?The house is still; the midnight seemsInscrutable—no answer there.Oh God!—to break this tension of despair.Between us the calm lamplight streams—"Good night!" and "Pleasant dreams !"•—yes—dreams. II I would I had lain with my love to-night;Her eyes trembled for her body said,"I have smoothed a pillow and made a bed"—But I smiled against itAnd turned away my headTo come into the cold starlight.I would I had lain with my love to-night,For I know how flowers are shed,And the cynical scintillant stars are dead—Dead, dead utterly!Yet I turned away my headTo come into the cold starlight.I would I had lain with my love to-night!Oh, indolent Gods, we too can treadOn the silent spirits, the uncomforted!She did not reproach me,Tho I turned away my headAnd came into the starlight. III Love (as a cloud on the seaHung between poles of blue)Hangs in the heart of meBetween the eyes of you.Love, as a cloud on the sea,Claims the tears of two.Love (as a wind in a treeShaking its tower of green)Shakes all the heart of meAnd leaves no peace between.Love, as the wind the treeTears with hands unseen.Love (as a storm on the seaShatters the sleep of the wave)Shatters the heart of meWith desires that grope and crave.Love, as the storm the sea,Boasts not me his slave. IV You, flower-named, and as a flower arrayed,Open to all the wandering airs that pass,Opened to me—yet I drew back afraid,Craven to the blood that would have preyedAnd the sly viper coiling in the grass. V Love, when you smiled and beckonedMy cold thought stood aloof and reckonedSome heights above you.But now you have turned and goneSmiling, fugitive as dawn,I know (oh fool!) I love you. VI Love, with her queen's face and child lipsWalked at my side; her hair about her headStreamed, with riotous and exuberant spreadLike sails and cordage of sea-breasting ships,And as the tides, her mirthful glints and dipsTugged at my anchor'd calmness—then she saidChilling to gravity, "You are lead."It was as when the bright blade cruelly slips,For in my soul that hid its vain desiresUnder closed hatch, I knew the stifled firesDevoured in silence, as stealthy serpents writheTheir folds about their prey; and seemed to hearThe passing of some irrevocable year,And faint for whistle of a monstrous scythe. VII Pain of widest range—The intimate grown strange. ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO And so the good Aeneas went away.It was not dawn, and yet the sleepless seaFelt as a mother, the still unborn day.The stars were brighter than they ought to be.A milky foam curled from the vessel's breastWhose long blades lifted to each lifting crest.Happy were the sailors to be aboard once more,And the laughing sea answered to their shouts afaroff shore.Dido the QueenKnew he was gone.No ned to have seenFrom the casement withdrawn;No need to be told;Her heart had guessedBy the aching unrestAnd empty breast—Empty and cold.Oh, plain her Maidens at their spinning,Love has end that had beginning. As the course was traced Aeneas paced,His thoughts uprising like a flock of birds;And one flew west, to the new the unknown nest,And one that was wing'd with flaming words—Something the Queen had uttered, tender—sweet,—Fluttered back and died—just at her feet.Ho! chants a Rower, straining at the sweep,Leave the landsman to his pillow, the sailor to thedeep.All night the QueenIn fever burned;A dream returnedLong ago seen:A dream of ships,Of one who cameOut of a flameAnd cried her nameAnd kissed her lips.Somewhere in the dawn Someone's singing:"Lo! what gifts love's hands are bringing!" Jet-black, the palms like sculptured fountains loomedAbove the lovers; one star blazed all night.Beyond the river was the sea that boomed.Their barge was lit with lightnings of delight.Of this, the good Aenaes too had dreamedWhile the unshaken towers of Ilium gleamed.Ah! cry the sailors, ''whom we loved must wait.There's no turning back from the open track to thegates of fate."The cicadas drone;Desert winds blowAs oarsmen rowTheir Queen aloneDown the river.Alone, she criedAlone! to the tide.And the sea repliedForever!La, croon the Women, nimbly weaving,"Whose heart do we hear grieving?" Months bring all wanderings to a close.The fleet years flee; Aeneas wisely wed,Often, when wind and sea strike mighty blows,Wakening from dreams half ecstasy, half dread,That come upon him from another life,Touches the calm breast of his sleeping wife.Hum, the Night Watch mutters, leaning on his spear," 'Tis a strange world to be in and to have no fear."The sea at lastBrings pain to end.The desert vastBecomes her friend.Her people fear it:"The Queen," they say,"Grows day by dayPaler, but still gay—As a spirit."Oh, they murmur, "Queen Dido goes awayTo where the dark river runs, sunless and gray." A HYMN TO DIONYSUS IN SPRING Yellow the sands of the shores of Elis, and over thecreamingFoam-flakes that flutter and curl on the edge of thedreamingMediterranean, Jupiter arches his azure dome.Here to the somnolent sands the Aeolian women havecome,The dreamers, all languid with silence of spring-tidedreaming,And they stand with their hair unbound and their feetin the foam.The heart of the morning beats with a swooning,amorous beating,And the nymph-cool waters and brazen sunshine meet- ing,Mingle where indolent spring-tide ripples shimmerand burn;Out to the dim horizon the eyes of the dreamersyearn,And like flutes are the low, soft voices that chant thus,entreatingThe God, Dionysus, to rise from the sea and return. "Bitter thy roving hath been, O Hunter, and strickenwith madness,And thy winter frenzy hath torn us with torment ofsadness—Horror of blood in the mouth and of murderous luststhat bringShadows a-couch in the forest from under us shud- dering.We are sick of the feverish nights that have stolenour gladness—Ah! we are weary of winter and fain of the Spring!""Thy foes, O Hunter, have goaded thy soul, but theirgoading is over,For every unfolding leaf is a shield for thy coverAnd every grass-blade upraises a spear that is scimi- tar-keen,Gladly the flowers will weave thee a mantle to wanderunseen.Slim as a willow-v/and, Ariadne awaits thee, her lover,And her heart is full of the dreams that are cool andgreen." "Hye, the Dew, thy mother, sorrows because of thygoing,And the film-pale, rain-sweet Hyades fleeing and flow- ing,Dissolved from the rainbow and river to rise in thesap of the tree,Leave never their dolorous grieving, lamenting inquest of thee.And the succulent vine and the spirit of all thingsgrowingCry 'Dionysus, return! Oh, return from the sea!' ""Wilt thou forsake us forever, unheeding our sedulousplaining ?See'st not the clusters of pale green globes, crescentand strainingSunwards, that long for thy hand to engarb themwith royal attire?Hear us, O Wine-God; return to us! Kindle oncemore Desire!"So chant the Aeolian women till the light be waningWhile the foam breaks over their feet in soft foldsof fire. The robes of the sun are red, and close to the earthhe dozes;The long day lingers, then slowly and silently closesThe shadowy orient gates, climbing upward stair bystair,Raising her evening face to the stars in the spring- tide air.Lo! the sea is aglow and aflame with the odor ofroses!Lo! a glimpse of the God with the sun in his yellowhair!
