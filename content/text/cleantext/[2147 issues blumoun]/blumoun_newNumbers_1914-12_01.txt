CRYPT HOUSE PRESS,GLOUCESTER. A Quarterly Publication of the Poems of John Drink waterRupert BrookeLascelles AbercrombieWilfrid Wilson Gibson THE CARVER IN STONE John Drinkwater (To E. M.)He was a man with wide and patient eyes,Gray, like the drift of twitch-fires blown in June,That, without fearing, searched if any wrongMight threaten from your heart. Gray eyes he hadUnder a brow was drawn because he knewSo many seasons to so many passOf upright service, loyal, unabasedBefore the world seducing, and so, barrenOf good words praising and thought that mated his.He carved in stone. Out of his quiet lifeHe watched as any faithful seaman chargedWith tidings of the myriad faring sea,And thoughts and premonitions through his mindSailing as ships from strange and storied landsHis hungry spirit held, till all they wereFound living witness in the chiselled stone.Slowly out of the dark confusion, spreadBy life's innumerable venturingsOver his brain, he would triumph into the lightOf one clear mood, unblemished of the blindLegions of errant thought that cried aboutHis rapt seclusion : as a pearl unsoiled,Nay, rather washed to lonelier chastity,In gritty mud. And then would come a bird,A flower, or the wind moving upon a flower,A beast at pasture, or a clustered fruit,A peasant face as were the saints of old,The leer of custom, or the bow of the moonSwung in miraculous poise—some stray from the worldOf things created by the eternal mind In joy articulate. And his perfect moodWould dwell about the token of God's mood,Until in bird or flower or moving windOr flock or shepherd or the troops of heavenIt sprang in one fierce moment of desireTo visible form.Then would his chisel work among the stone,Persuading it of petal or of limbOr starry curve, till risen anew there sangShape out of chaos, and again the visionOf one mind single from the world was pressedUpon the daily custom of the skyOr field or the body of man. His peopleHad many gods for worship. The tiger-god,The owl, the dewlapped bull, the running pard,The camel and the lizard of the slime,The ram with quivering fleece and fluted horn,The crested eagle and the doming batWere sacred. And the king and his high priestsDecreed a temple, wide on columns huge,Should top the cornlands to the sky's far line.They bade the carvers carve along the wallsImages of their gods, each one to carveAs he desired, his choice to name his god. . . .And many came ; and he among them, gladOf three leagues' travel through the singing airOf dawn among the boughs yet bare of green,The eager flight of the spring leading his bloodInto swift lofty channels of the air, Proud as an eagle riding to the sun. . . .An eagle, clean of pinion—there's his choice.Daylong they worked under the growing roof,One at his leopard, one the staring ram,And he winning his eagle from the stone,Until each man had carved one image out,Arow beyond the portal of the house.They stood arow, the company of gods,Camel and bat, lizard and bull and ram,The pard and owl, dead figures on the wall,Figures of habit driven on the stoneBy chisels governed by no heat of the brainBut drudges of hands that moved by easy rule.Proudly recorded mood was none, no thoughtPlucked from the dark battalions of the mindAnd throned in everlasting sight. But oneGod of them all was witness of beliefAnd large adventure dared. His eagle spreadWide pinions on a cloudless ground of heaven,Glad with the heart's high courage of that dawnMoving upon the ploughlands newly sown,Dead stone the rest. He looked, and knew it so.Then came the king with priests and counsellorsAnd many chosen of the people, wiseWith words weary of custom, and eyes askewThat watched their neighbour face for any newsOf the best way of judgment, till, each sureNone would determine with authority,All spoke in prudent praise. One liked the owl Because an owl blinked on the beam of his barn.One, hoarse with crying gospels in the street,Praised most the ram, because the common folkWore breeches made of ram's wool. One declaredThe tiger pleased him best,—the man who carvedThe tiger-god was halt out of the womb—A man to praise, being so pitiful.And one, whose eyes dwelt in a distant void,With spell and omen pat upon his lips,And a purse for any crystal prophet ripe,A zealot of the mist, gazed at the bull—A lean ill-shapen bull of meagre linesThat scarce the steel had graved upon the stone—Saying that here was very mysteryAnd truth, did men but know. And one there wasWho praised his eagle, but rememberingThe lither pinion of the swift, the curveThat liked him better of the mirrored swan.And they who carved the tiger-god and ram,The camel and the pard, the owl and bull,And lizard, listened greedily, and madeHumble denial of their worthiness,And when the king his royal judgment gaveThat all had fashioned well, and bade that eachRe-shape his chosen god along the wallsTill all the temple boasted of their skill,They bowed themselves in token that as thisNever had carvers been so fortunate.Only the man with wide and patient eyesMade no denial, neither bowed his head. Already while they spoke his thought had goneFar from his eagle, leaving it for a signIvoyally wrought of one deep breath of life,And played about the image of a toadThat crawled among his ivy leaves. A queerPuff-bellied toad, with eyes that always staredSidelong at heaven and saw no heaven there,Weak-hammed, and with a throttle somehow twistedBeyond full wholesome draughts of air, and skinOf wrinkled lips, the only zest or willThe little flashing tongue searching the leaves.And king and priest, chosen and counsellor,Babbling out of their thin and jealous brains,Seemed strangely one; a queer enormous toadPanting under giant leaves of dark,Sunk in the loins, peering into the day.Their judgment wry he counted not for wrongMore than the fabled poison of the toadStriking at simple wits; how should their thoughtOr word in praise or blame come near the peaceThat shone in seasonable hours aboveThe patience of his spirit's husbandry ?They foolish and not seeing, how should heSpend anger there or fear—great ceremoniesEqual for none save great antagonists ?The grave indifference of his heart before themWas moved by laughter innocent of hate,Chastising clean of spite, that moulded themInto the antic likeness of his toadBidding for laughter underneath the leaves. He bowed not, nor disputed, but he sawThose ill-created joyless gods, and loathed,And saw them creeping, creeping round the walls,Death breeding death, wile witnessing to wile,And sickened at the dull iniquityShould be rewarded, and for ever breatheContagion on the folk gathered in prayer.His truth should not be doomed to march amongThis falsehood to the ages. He was called,And he must labour there; if so the kingWould grant it, where the pillars bore the roofA galleried way of meditation nursedSecluded time, with wall of ready stoneIn panels for the carver set betweenThe windows—there his chisel should be set,—It was his plea. And the king spoke of him,Scorning, as one lack-fettle, among all theseKager to take the riches of renown ;One fearful of the light or knowing nothingOf light's dimension, a witling who would throwHonour aside and praise spoken aloudAll men of heart should covet. him goGrubbing out of the sight of these who knewThe worth of substance; there was his proper trade.A squat and curious toad indeed. . . . The eyes,Patient and grey, were dumb as were the lips,That, fixed and governed, hoarded from them allThe larger laughter lifting in his heart.Straightway about his gallery he moved,Measured the windows and the virgin stone, Till all was weighed and patterned in his brain.Then first where most the shadow struck the wall,Under the sills, and centre of the base,From floor to sill out of the stone was wooedMemorial folly, as from the chisel leaptHis chastening laughter searching priest and king—A huge and wrinkled toad, with legs asplay,And belly loaded, leering with great eyesBusily fixed upon the void. All daysHis chisel was the first to ring acrossThe temple's quiet; and at fall of duskPassing among the carvers homeward, theyWould speak of him as mad, or weak againstThe challenge of the world, and let him goIyonely, as was his will, under the nightOf stars or cloud or summer's folded sun,Through crop and wood and pastureland to sleep.None took the narrow stair as wonderingHow did his chisel prosper in the stone,Unvisited his labour and forgot.And times when he would lean out of his heightAnd watch the gods growing along the walls,The row of carvers in their linen coatsTook in his vision a virtue that aloneCarving they had not nor the thing they carved.Knowing the health that flowed about his closeImagining, the daily quiet wonFrom process of his clean and supple craft,Those carvers there, far on the floor below, Would haply be transfigured in his thoughtInto a gallant company of menGlad of the strict and loyal reckoningThat proved in the just presence of the brainEach chisel-stroke. How surely would he prosperIn pleasant talk at easy hours with menSo fashioned if it mightbband his eyesWould pass again to those dead gods that grewIn spreading evil round the temple walls;And, one dead pressure made, the carvers movedAlong the wall to mould and mould againThe self-same god, their chisels on the stoneTapping in dull precision as before,And he would turn, back to his lonely truth.He carved apace. And first his people's gods,About the toad, out of their sterile time,Under his hand thrilled and were recreate.The bull, the pard, the camel and the ram,Tiger and owl and bat—all were the signsVisibly made body on the stoneOf sightless thought adventuring the hostThat is mere spirit; these the bloom achievedBy secret labour in the flowing woodOf rain and air and wind and continent sun. . . .His tiger, lithe, immobile in the stone,A swift destruction for a moment leashed,Sprang crying from the jealous stealth of menOpposed in cunning watch, with engines hidOf torment and calamitous desire.His leopard, swift on lean and paltry limbs, Was fear in flight before accusing faith.His bull, with eyes that often in the duskWould lift from the sweet meadow grass to watchHim homeward passing, bore on massy beamThe burden of the patient of the earth.His camel bore the burden of the damned,Being gaunt, with eyes aslant along the nose.He had a friend, who hammered bronze and ironAnd cupped the moonstone on a silver ring,One constant like himself, would come at nightOr bid him as a guest, when they would makeTheir poets touch a starrier height, or searchTogether with unparsimonious mindThe crowded harbours of mortality.And there were jests, wholesome as harvest ale,Of homely habit, bred of hearts that daredJudgment of laughter under the eternal eye:This frolic wisdom was his carven owl.His ram was lordship on the lonely hills,Alert and fleet, content only to knowThe wind mightily pouring on his fleece,With yesterday and all unrisen sunsPoorer than disinherited ghosts. His batWas ancient envy made a mockery,Cowering below the newer eagle carvedAbove the arches with wide pinion spread,His faith's dominion of that happy dawn.And so he wrought the gods upon the wall,Iyiving and crying out of his desire,Out of his patient incorruptible thought, Wrought them in joy was wages to his faith.And other than the gods he made. The stalksOf bluebells heavy with the news of spring,The vine loaded with plenty of the year,And swallows, merely tenderness of thoughtBidding the stone to small and fragile flight;leaves, the thin relics of autumnal boughs,Or massed in June. . . .All from their native pressure bloomed and sprangUnder his shaping hand into a proudAnd governed image of the central man,—Their moulding, charts of all his travelling.And all were deftly ordered, duly setBetween the windows, underneath the sills,And roofward, as a motion rightly planned,Till on the wall, out of the sullen stone,A glory blazed, his vision manifest,His wonder captive. And he was content.And when the builders and the carvers knewTheir labour done, and high the temple stoodOver the cornlands, king and counsellorAnd priest and chosen of the people cameAmong a ceremonial multitudeTo dedication. And, below the thronesWhere king and archpriest ruled above the throng,Highest among the ranked artificersThe carvers stood. And when, the temple vowedTo holy use, tribute and choral praiseGiven as was ordained, the king looked downUpon the gathered folk, and bade them see The comely gods fashioned about the walls,And keep in honour men whose precious skillCould so adorn the sessions of their worship,Gravely the carvers bowed them to the ground.Only the man with wide and patient eyesStood not among them; nor did any comeTo count his labour, where he watched aloneAbove the coloured throng. He heard, and lookedAgain upon his work, and knew it good,Smiled on his toad, passed down the stair unseen,And sang across the teeming meadows home. THE TREASURE Rupert Brooke When colour goes home into the eyes,And lights that shine are shut againWith dancing girls and sweet birds' criesBehind the gateways of the brain;And that no-place which gave them birth, shall closeThe rainbow and the rose:—Still may Time hold some golden spaceWhere 111 unpack that scented storeOf song and flower and sky and face,And count, and touch, and turn them o'er,Musing upon them; as a mother, whoHas watched her children all the rich day through,Sits, quiet-handed, in the fading light,When children sleep, ere night. 1914 I PEACE Now, God be thanked Who has matched us with His hour,And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary,Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move,And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,And all the little emptiness of love !Oh ! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,Naught broken save this body, lost but breath;Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace thereBut only agony, and that has ending,And the worst friend and enemy is but Death. II SAFETY Dear! of all happy in the hour, most blestHe who has found our hid security,Assured in the dark tides of the world that rest,And heard our word, " Who is so safe as we ?We have found safety with all things undying,The winds, and morning, tears of men and mirth,The deep night, and birds singing, and clouds flying,And sleep, and freedom, and the autumnal earth.We have built a house that is not for Time's throwing.We have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever.War knows no power. Safe shall be my going,Secretly armed against all death's endeavour ;Safe though all safety's lost; safe where men fall;And if these poor limbs die, safest of all. III THE DEAD. Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!There's none of these so lonely and poor of old,But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold.These laid the world away ; poured out the redSweet wine of youth ; gave up the years to beOf work and joy, and that unhoped serene,That men call age; and those who would have been,Their sons, they gave, their immortality.Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth,Holiness, lacked so long, and L,ove, and Pain.Honour has come back, as a king, to earth,And paid his subjects with a royal wage;And Nobleness walks in our ways again;And we have come into our heritage. IV THE DEAD These hearts were woven of human joys and cares,Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth.The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs,And sunset, and the colours of the earth.These had seen movement, and heard music; knownSlumber and waking ; loved ; gone proudly friended ;Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone;Touched flowers and furs, and cheeks. All this is]fendedThere are waters blown by changing winds to laughterAnd lit by the rich skies, all day. And after,Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that danceAnd wandering loveliness. He leaves a whiteUnbroken glory, a gathered radiance,A width, a shining peace, under the night. V THE SOLDIER If I should die, think only this of me :That there's some corner of a foreign fieldThat is for ever England. There shall beIn that rich earth a richer dust concealed;A dust whom Kngland bore, shaped, made aware,Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,A body of England's, breathing English air,Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.And think, this heart, all evil shed away,A pulse in the eternal mind, no lessGives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,In hearts at peace, under an English heaven. THE STAIRCASE Lascelles Abercrombie A small room in an empty cottage, without furniture. Stone floor;dirty ragged paper on walls. The room is littered with bits of sawnwood, shavings, tools ; a joiner's frail lies on the floor. Door to theopen air on right; in the back wall an old kitchen range, with a goodfire burning. A young joiner is alone in the room; he has beenputting in a new staircase, which is all but finished; the new wood,clean and white, shows up amid the dingy room.The Joiner (looking at his work : in a sort of chant)Hammer and nails, gimlet and screws,Bradawl, chisel, mallet and plane,A will to work, and health in my thews,And season'd wood of a good clean grainShaping under my hands and skill,And obeying my master-will (Speaking)And I alone: that's the best of it here.—These book-read folks won't beat that song of mine,I warrant. I'll have a right tune for it some day:Hammer and nails, gimlet and screws,Bradawl, chisel, mallet and plane,A will to work The outer door is pusht open, and a woman comesin, tired and worn, wet through, with a long shabbycloak on her. She stands a moment gazing round theroom.Woman: Alone ?Was it you buzzing to yourself I heard ?Grumbling for company ?The young man stares at her and answers mechanicallyJoiner : For company ? lld liever keep to myself.Woman : Dreaming aloud, then ?— Ay, cleverest thing To do against the world, for sure, is dreaming.But it needs shelter.— Well, go on dreaming.I'll borrow your warmth awhile ; the drench of the rainIs dribbling down my skin inside my clothesCold as worms.She sits by the fire, opens her cloak, and shows sheis holding a baby. She begins to suckle it.Joiner : You've got a baby !Woman : Well done, young man !You know a thing or two : a baby it is.—Finish your job, and I'll keep on at mine.Joiner : I'm all but done here now.Woman : What were you at ?Joiner : Framing the new stairs. Are you travelling ?Woman : Travelling and travelling ; still walking.Joiner : A strange place for you to be walking, here.Woman : I'll swear to that: strange and miserable.Not such another road in ChristendomFor wind that's carrying a cruel rainTo get the better of your heart.Joiner: I mean,The road goes nowhere, but to these few hutsThat stick against the hillside.Woman : I know that—Now I am here I know it.— But at leastThe road has brought me to your fire. Young man,Why do you stare so ? Do you know my face ?You don't belong here ? Joiner : Five miles off I live.Woman : Ah .... [Her talk seems meant to cover some feeling.They are pretty work, your stairs:They look too white in this curst filthy room;a mind where the dirty world has lived and slept,But still remembering in midst of the soilSome childish morning spent in games and laughterUnder a blowing orchard.— he is still silent.Ay, queer to find fresh work in such a place.Is the house set then to a new-comer ?Who will first climb your stairs ? A girl, maybe,Upon her wedding night. She'll slip awayFrom off her husband's knees, and dance up swift,Giggling shy and happily afraid,And the house falls quiet of their talk ; and thenThe old joists creak as she moves in her undressing;Then the lad slinks up after, like a robber.Joiner : It's strange ! A little while before you came,It was with just that fancy I was idling.Woman : I warrant, you yourself were the lad, then.Joiner [simply) : Yes.Woman : And the girl ?Joiner : I don't know—rightly—Woman : Which to choose ?Joiner : O long ago I made my choice : and yet—I have not seen her.Woman (after a little pause) : I could dream once myself.—[ Then amused at his simplicity :But will you know her — What would you say if IWent up those stairs of yours ? Joiner (startled, staring at her) : You ? You ?I did not think you were putting fun upon me.Woman (looking back at him with amused bitterness) :Indeed, you are in the right:I am naught to visit a young man's dreams.But I was gibing at myself, not you :I mind my manners : beggars thrive by them.Joiner (gently) : Are you begging your way ?Woman : Yes ; I want food.Joiner: If you'll come home with me—Woman : Five miles away !No, I will warm myself, and something dryThe heavy moisture that has made my skirtsRasp the skin off my ankles.—Were the old stairsRotten past mending ?Joiner: Crumbling into holes.No nature left in the wood but must and dry-rot:I knockt 'em into powder. The old man,Who lived here by himself, was coming down,And caught his heel at top ; the tread broke through,Tript his footing—Woman (repressing eagerness) : And he hurt himself ?Joiner: Smasht his wicked old back bone.Woman : Why, you seemTo hate the man.Joiner: A gallows snarling tyke.Woman : What had you against him ? Joiner: He would have known whatIf I'd had chance to bring his wicked bloodBlushing about his ears.Woman : There's a bold fellow ;To wish he could have boxt an old man's ears!Joiner: No ; but I would have had such words for him,His wizened heart had been ashamed.Woman: Why, then,Happen the old man might have boxt your ears !Joiner : Ay, have your game with me : but if he'd beenA giant with a rage like a burning demon's,I would have faced his wildness.Woman : Well, he's dead,And talk's an easy thing. But I've heard tell—For on the road, young man, your ears find outNoises from every corner in the land—I've heard he was a terrible fierce old fellow.Joiner : Likely enough.You'ld hear, too, of the scoundrel thing he didUpon his daughter : you could scarce miss that;The villainous sound of it must be ranging still.Woman: But what seems loud to you among these hills,And a rough splash in a quiet creek of life,Will hardly push a little shaking whisperInto the air of the broad troubled world.—Was it a pretty wench ?Joiner : Why, you'ld be bound,If she were here, to think there's none in allThe room of the land could show their beauty off,But only as lighting matches in the sun. Woman : I would be bound to think so !Joiner : Yes : she'ld come,Ivike you, suppose now, out of the windy rain;She'ld have been tussling with its force against herlike a young girl laughing with her brotherBecause he plays mock-ruffian ; and the gameWould shine still in her eyes as she came in;And she'ld be walking lightly with the gleeWould seem to sing in her body, all so thrilledFrom the wind's pouring through her dress. It wouldBe strange to see her, a strange and lovely thingTo see her coming back here after all.Woman (laughing) : This is a wonder! And so she's your fancy,The girl so friendly to your loneliness!I'll hurt myself with laughing ! This is the girlWho slipt away from whispering in the firelightTo run with pretty laughter up your stairs ?Joiner : Well, if she is ?Woman : Isn't it queer you knowJust how the girl would look ?Joiner : I'ld swear to her !Woman : And it's a minute gone, you said your eyesHad never lived upon her!—Joiner : You've made me a fool now, I suppose. You're welcome.But I was bound to talk so, being so longHere in the house, that somehow must, I'm sure,Remember her—the timber and the stoneThat felt the sound of her laughter and her ways—Woman : O let's have little of that.—Why did you playThis lying game on me ? Joiner (amazed) : Why did I play— ?Woman (standing up) : Iyies ! Iyies ! What were all your lies for ?\Joiner (catching her anger) : How will a roadster know the lies[from truth,Who has to lie for her eating, lie for her lodging,And the whole gear of her life is lies ?Woman : It's true :We lie for needs : you for a fleering scoff.Joiner : You've had no harm from me; and let your tongueMake sure of this, so long as we're in talk :This girl, and the way the thought of her has grownWithin my brain— O, like rivers pouringFull from the flooded hills,—Woman : You'll lose yourselfBragging her up so handsome ; I'll help you out:This is the thing you mean ? —It would be like a hand with grimy fingersMeddling in the fine make of a clock, to letTalk common as mine touch your fancyingThat goes so smooth and chimes to you so dainty.Well, I'll believe 'tis fancies, and not lies :But I must have my laugh at them.Joiner : Yes, laugh, laugh ;It's pretty joking.—There's a girl grows upBeautiful and sweet hearted : and there comesA rogue sneaking into her innocence,Wheedling and living there; and she, dear fool,Comforting him; and he blabbing abroadThe simple way her love had askt him in. Woman : Did he do that ?Joiner : Yes, such a blackguard he was.But how would a girl so happy know his mindWas just a muddy puddle ?—She'ld only seeThe face of her own love there, looking back.—Woman : The pitiful fool. Ah, but it's fools you like.Joiner : You'ld like the folk who went about to stirThat wild brute of anger in her father,And pitcht their buzzing jeers just loud enoughTo startle it, and make it savage her.They quickly had him crazed. Soon as he hearsThe village sniggering its dirty gossip,And knows his daughter's come to trouble and dangerWoman : Through being a pitiful fool—Joiner : He thrashes her,Thrashes her, and rails her out of the house,Childing as she was : and heavilyTo trudge after the slinking runagateWho fouled her, the poor lass must go alone.—Five years ago it would be. O, if I d heard,She need not have gone crying into hiding!And lightly I learnt the tale of it all at first:But it slipt over my mind like a noosed wireThat snares a rabbit's neck, and the peg fails,And puss goes free : the gin has not left go,But tightens still and cankers into her life.Just so the story of how they shamed the girlClung like a loop of wire and gnawed its holdUpon my mind: whenever I work alone, I'm thinking of the world breaking her spirit,And turning into misery the heartThat was so blithe and singing.Well, here's for you to laugh at. Why don't you laugh ?Woman : I'm thinking of that old man, left aloneWith shame upon his age, and dying alone.Joiner : And she has none to think of her but me !Even the thought of kindness keeps itselfSafe from a life like hers, as rats will jumpIn harbour from a boat fierce weather has strained.Woman : Somebody told you that too ?—You have the brave life, always among notions !But you're not fair to rats. What have they doneThat you should liken them to charity ?This would be better: Vermin crawling outFrom the clothes of a beggar's corpse, soon as they feelThe warmth of their lodging chill. I have not livedIn notions, but in seeing things ; that's one :Cold morning, a white road, and at the sideA tramp lies dead of starving, and all round him Ugh ! [Her voice begins to accuse him.And I've a mind to stop you cockeringYour halfling blood. What right have you to beSo brave and comfortable with your dreamsOf that lost fool—you always in a house—While she, the truth of them, goes broad awakeIn agony ?Joiner: Wouldn't I do her allThe good a man can think of ? Why must you gibe ?It's only that she's gone, she's never heard of. Woman : She might come back.Joiner: Be sure I'll know of it.Woman : Yes, I believe you will.Then what will you do with her ?Joiner : What's that to you ?Woman : Why, I should know what you will do with me.Come now ; you must have thought it out.Joiner : With you ?You mean . . . ? Are you for fooling me again ?Woman : And bitter fooling now. lam the girl.Joiner : You're not. You can't be. Often I've heard tell—Woman : Of pretty looks and laughing ways. Five yearsOf following a tramping labourerWill alter that. This baby's not the first,The other two are dead. And I've been chapt,And I've been tired out, and clemm'd and burntWith walking through the winds and the hot days;It's just a frame I am beneath my clothes.You made your fancy of my spirit breaking;The fancy would have been too wise to liveIf it had heeded how my body faredOut there on the road, ageing and grieving.—Wonderful, isn't it, how dreams come true ?Joiner : You're clever with your wiles. You've tript me upOnce already; but I'm not caught this time.Woman : Ay, but you are ; you're trapt and floundering.Iyisten : I'll prove myself. What would bring me here ?The road ends in the nowhere of the hills; A blind man's feet could tell that from the rutsAnd the sward that's all across it. Why should I comeSuch an unlikely way, with hunger on meNo longer anguish, but a load, a load ?I came to find my father.— O my prideI've eaten long since; and poor meat it was,No stay in it for me or for my bairn.—I thought my dad might pay a shilling or twoFor the sight of me still in my misery;Or maybe only a morsel; that would do—Stop me starving my baby. Nowhere elseDare we be asking, or chance showing ourselves;For we go cunning as stoats, my man and I:Anyone looking at us may be the law.Joiner : You're escaping the law ?— It was not you,I'll vow, that did the wrong.Woman : I did my share.You mind these rick-fires, kept the nights aglowFor near a week, until the rain set in?—It might have been the nights they have in the northAmong the foundries, where they smelt the iron,And furnaces keep glaring at the cloudsTill it's like red hot weather above the darkness.—I reckon we had you watching the sky! Bach nightA blazing rick, ten or twelve miles from the last!—He swore held rouse the land. No one at allWould give us jobs—a tramp and his homeless doxy.And a queer time I had with him and his fists;Till the rage seemed to addle in his brain,And he could think of naught but stacks to fire. But he'll be tried for blood as well as burning,If it's the truth we heard. A shippen caughtAnd sent the blaze along its thatch to the house;And in the scare there was a child forgotThat slept alone in the attic.— Well, my boyIs like to be clemm'd for his death : it's all one,Hunger and cold, or fire.— I hope the ladWas stifled first, though; I've been praying that.Joiner : And it's you telling me this, as calm as newsOf prices at the market!Woman : Now do you see ?I've put myself clean into your mercy.Would I have riskt your mind, without I wereYour own fine dream rousing you into daylight ?—This takes you down from your fool'd life, I think!So will you give us up, my man and I ?He's known for his talk: there'll be a cry abroadAfter us, I'll be bound.— You'll not, I know;Because I am your lovely dream come true.—Surely 'tis time you were pleased.Joiner: O let me be!Give me a little while to breathe myself.Woman: IndeedIt goes up hill, out of a dream to truth.But I've come down a little; I thought to findMy old angry father; and I find you !—Now, are we right yet ? Or shall I tell you whereThe stairs were rotted worst ?— Third from top :Half of it flimsy and soft as blanket, halfGaping open. Joiner : Ay, there the old brute tript.Woman : And with him died our last poor chance of food.We'd best be off now, baby. [But she makes no attempt to go. Ashort pause ; then she laughs.Joiner : Will you forgive me ?Woman : What, for making meYour fancy game ?— I've had worse things to carry.Joiner : O make an end of that talk !—lt's the truthI have at last, after all my dreaming.Woman : I'll lay, it seems like when they scorch a pigAfter a killing!— Rubbish of straw and wasteFlares high and bold in a wind of golden flameAnd streaking sparks—a young man's mind of fancies.Then 'tis a mound of smoulder, crumbling inTo show parcht awkward trotters sticking up,Flap ears and senseless snouted head, and allThe poor pig's blacken'd hulk : and there's the truthWas hid inside a young man's burning dreams!—Well, I am not the sop I was ; there isA dry side to me now. So I'll be kindAnd take the truth I am out of your sight.Joiner : I let you go ? You think that's likely yet ?Woman (uneasy) : Are you for doing like the fool shown upWho braves his folly out by staying in it ?Joiner : You shall stay in it, too !— It goes up hill,You said, the way out of my dream ; uphillAnd the sun behind the hill! And now I've climbedWhere nothing stops the light, not even dreams.We'll not get higher than this, either of us. If we can't hold now to our meeting here,Here on the top of life, where every sideIs a slope falling, 'tis for both of usFrom this on going downward into shadows,Never again to be in sight or hail.Woman : If I'm not gone quickly, we're both in danger.Joiner : Will you not dare believe my meaning ?Woman : No. I'll only think, " Suppose, suppose he meant it! "—Joiner : Why, we're awake, and the dream still crying aloud!Woman : You close your mind to it. No hurt in dreams;But this that sounds so drawing—safer would beA viper hissing. 'Tis the truth of the worldPersuading you to come into its reach.Joiner : And the sound's drawing you !Woman : O, I must hearEverything I have lost—everythingThat is not the old cunning torturer,The world's merciless truth!— You Id never keep meSafe from the world in hiding of your dreams;The world would come for me, and strike you there.—I to be looking for a dream again,And you for truth to please you like your dreams It would be a wild-hearted game to play !Joiner : I did not mean it for a game, the whileI've been as good to my mind as to the steelI work with, all for the sake of finding you :Rusted metal, you know, may be wrought cleanAs glass, but the rust lies within, for everSpoiling the finest temper. Woman : Can you not seeThe rust of the world has eaten to my heart ?Joiner : Can you not see that my main life has beenKnowing of you held by the handl ng worldAll as it likes, and I the one to wringThe vile grasp off from you ? Don't make my lifeBreak its promise to me, so nearly kept!—I have gone hungry for this hour.Woman: And I,Have I not hunger'd ? Thank your God you keptYour hunger empty. I famisht, and was fedOn filthy poison, worse than being starved.— I never thought to have a mind againThat need not be ashamed of being alive!—You do not mean I should—love you ?Joiner : No, no ;We are not bargaining.Woman: I doubt I could not,Bven if I were wishing to.—Ivisten to me. Think God is eyeing you,And tell me fairly, 'tis a man's set mindYou have to—help me.Joiner : I'll make you another life !'Tis your say now.Woman : Sometimes it might be,In the hot dusty drouth of afternoon,We'ld pass a byre, and hear the milkers chat,—Girls laughing,—and spirted milk r ng in the cans.Or plodding stupidly on in windy dark, Our steps would sound against a cottage wallSleeping beside the lane : lld lean on it;Warmth would be in it; lld think of a drowzy fireInside the house, and hear the crickets chime. Young man, I'll risk you ! Let us be off, quick,Klse hell be coming in on us.Joiner : He ? Who ?Woman : The man that was my man.Joiner : He's nothing now.Woman : He was my man.Joiner: No need to think of him.-I've naught to say but—thank you.Woman : Thank me ?Joiner: Yes!Now I've a thing to do at last.Woman: But you,Never you look to have me thanking you ;For that might set me telling what I've been,The shame I have been, the dirt!— You must not know it.(With a gesture) O but if there is something in the worldThat can do good, and listens when 'tis called,I shall be asking it to stay with you;You have made room for me where never againI thought to live.— It goes beyond my thanks.Joiner: There's stumbling outside, coming up the path.Woman : We should have gone before this!—'Tis my man.The Tramp comes in.Tramp : Now where's the food ? Woman : My father's dead, they tell me.Tramp : I don't want your father ; I'm for eating.You said there'ld be food here.Woman : 'Tis not my fault;How could I know if he were gone or living ?Tramp : O, you keep on like a parrot. Food's the thing.Woman : A thing you'll have to walk some further for.Tramp : Why did you turn us here ? To play hot-cocklesSafe with a lad ?Joiner (to the Woman) : You're not to talk with him.Tramp : Not talk ?—She'll have to talk about the foodShe made out we'ld be having here. Where is it ?Woman : Are you fuddled ? There's none here.Tramp : None, by God !Not a bite ?Woman : Not a bite.Tramp (going towards her) : Then take your lesson!You'll feel my ten commandments now : you'll learnThe way of them by heart. [The woman, standing up, instinctivelypicks up the baby and holds it as herProtection.Lay the brat down !Put down that bastard, or he'll grow up lameAs you'll be when I've done you.[She lays the baby down and faces him.Ay, that's wiser:You mind what came of that trick once ?—And nowI'll twinge your arm till it crackles.Woman : No, not that! Joiner : I've payed out rope enough. I'll fasten it nowTaut, and you've hung yourself.—Round on your heelsAnd out of doors !Tramp : This isn't your ado ;Keep out.Joiner : You march now : I'll not bid you again.Tramp : Have I to down you first before I tanMy woman ? Do you call that fair ? It's low.I'm hunger-starved and done—just enough heartin me for lathering her; and youPush in, you with your belly crammed and good:It's low ! Stand off and be an Englishman.Joiner : You're too long standing. Will you have your teethSo quaked in your head, you'll never chew againHappily ? Off out of this !Tramp (half whimpering with weakness and anger) : Mate, fair play.Too bad it is. She cheats me of a mealAnd should be taught right. Ay, and you'ld have seen,If she had kept her word and found me meat,I am a man when I'm fed could do for youAnd lick her finely as well out of her lies:A job for each hand that. But now—There's nothing fair in the world, after this!Joiner : You'll have it then ?Tramp (in a rage) : And empty as Ibe111 match you : win or lose, she'll pay me for itWhen we're alone.Woman {looking out through the open door): Have you been showing[yourself ? Tramp (apprehensive at once) : What is it now ?Woman : Three men, mighty cautious,And almost here.Tramp : They'll not find me. [Making for the door.Woman: You fool,They're right in front.Tramp : You bitch, you have me trapt!0 I will need to go into hard trainingIf I'm to pay you the fair price for this !Woman : Ay, shout to them " Here's your man ! "Tramp : What will I do ?—Up the stairs and out of a window and off,That's my road. [He goes upstairs.Woman : There's the first to take your stairsJoiner : And a good use for them ; it quits us of him.Three Men come in (1, 2, &amp; 3.)1. Ay, there he is !2. The man !3. The very man !1 markt him well, nosing the taproom whiffBeside the door, and fearing to go in.1. You see his cunning ?2. Why, he's washt his face !3. 'Tis that! I thought he lookt another man !1. But not this way you'll put off eyes like ours.Woman : O will they take him ?— I'd not plotted that!Joiner : Ay, the thing plans itself, once we can holdTheir crazy pother. Woman : Keep them blunderingA while, a little while !2. We'll have to goCarefully about him.3. Ay, 'tis a faceWith gallows in it. When I saw him leantBeside the taproom door, with his eyes cadging,I thought, " There's a slaughtering visnomy! "1. I've no notion at all of seeing him hangedFor murdering me.2. Young fellow, own to yourself!You're the rick-burner.3. Ay, and he burnt a lad.Joiner: Do hold your blathering a bit and hear me.Or if you won't, see this. [Holding up a hammer.1. He means battery !2. Dreadful things can be done with a hammer.3. When heThat uses it is wild and knows the wayThrough your skull and into your brain.Joiner : Do stop !lam the joiner here. Yonder's my work,The staircase. And the man you want has boltedUp to the loft, and you have him caged and safe.1. Are there weapons upstairs ?Joiner: Go on and take him.The room's bare boards and walls, and he's as weakWith famishing as a fly.2. Well, if you're sure You're not the man 3- No, no ; I saw right offHe had the look of someone else.1. {Marshalling them at the staircase) Now for it!2. Mind the reward that's posted for him !3- Charge![ They rush up the stairs.Joiner : This falls out well. Here's an easy riddance,And the way smooth from here.Woman : Were you not toldTo break out larger windows in the attics ?They're cruel small!Joiner : Cruel and small indeedTo one who thinks of squeezing his escapeThrough one of them.— But I can hear they have him.[The three men come down with the Tramp.1. The man for certain this time.Tramp : Copt! Copt!Woman : We couldn't flee for ever. Is it far,The way to the jail ? They'll give us food there, likely.2 {to the Woman). What, are you coming too ?Woman : Yes, I'm coming.3. Were you in with his burnings ?Woman : They are mineAs much as his. I screened his light from draughts.Joiner : He made her do it \—{to the Woman) There's no need forTramp : Copt is the word ! [this ! Woman : And I am glad it's over.Joiner : It's over right enough ; the whole black timeIs over now. Must you see him to jail ?How can you make your duty such a thing ?Woman : You'll never want a flatterer, young man,Not while your own tongue lives. Who said I madeGoing with him my duty ?1. Settle your mindAnd choose your man, missis : come on or stay.Woman : And you talk civil, mister ! Choose my man !Joiner {to the Tramp) : You will not drag her with you ?Woman : O, you haveQueer sense in you ! Who's dragging me at all ?Joiner {to the Tramp) : Have you not had enough of injuring her ?Go off from her at last!Tramp : Copt! Fair copt!Woman : Thank you for lending me your fire, young man.{to the men) Not budging yet ? [They begin to go out.Bless my wits, I was leaving you the brat!Is it still raining ? I must lap him well:There is a trouble in his breath already.[When the Joiner is left alone and the door closed,the curtain comes down. THE ORPHANS Wilfrid Wilson Gibson At five o'clock one April mornI met them making tracks,Young Benjamin and Abel Horn,With bundles on their backs.Young Benjamin is seventy-five,Young Abel, seventy-seven—The oldest innocents aliveBeneath that April heaven.I asked them why they trudged aboutWith crabby looks and sour—" And does your mother know you're outAt this unearthly hour ? "They stopped: and scowling up at meKach shook a grizzled head,And swore ; and then spat bitterly,As with one voice they said:" Homeless, about the country-sideWe never thought to roam;But mother, she has gone and died,And broken up the home." THE PESSIMIST His body bulged with puppies—little eyesPeeped out of every pocket, black and bright;And with as innocent, round-eyed surpriseHe watched the glittering traffic of the night." What this world's coming to I cannot tell,"He muttered, as I passed him, with a whine—" Things surely must be making slap for hell,When no one wants these little dogs of mine." GIRL'S SONG I saw three black pigs ridingIn a blue and yellow cart—Three black pigs riding to the fairBehind the old grey dappled mare—But it wasn't black pigs ridingIn a gay and gaudy cartThat sent me into hidingWith a flutter in my heart.I heard the cart returning,The jolting jingling cart—Returning empty from the fairBehind the old jog-trotting mare—But it wasn't the returningOf a clattering, empty cartThat sent the hot blood burningAnd throbbing through my heart. THE OLD NAIL-SHOP I dreamt of wings,—and waked to hearThrough the low sloping ceiling clearThe nesting starlings flutter and scratchAmong the rafters of the thatch,Not twenty inches from my head;And lay, half-dreaming, in my bed,Watching the far elms, bolt-uprightBlack towers of silence in a nightOf stars, square-framed between the sillOf the casement and the eaves, untilI drowsed, and must have slept a wink . . .And wakened to a ceaseless clinkOf hammers ringing on the air . . .And, somehow, only half-aware,I'd risen, and crept down the stair,Bewildered by strange, smoky gloom,Until I'd reached the living-roomThat once had been a nailshop-shed.And where my hearth had blazed, insteadI saw the nail-forge glowing red;And, through the stife and smoky glare,Three dreaming women standing thereWith hammers beating red-hot wireOn tinkling anvils, by the fire,To ten-a-penny nails; and heard—Though none looked up or breathed a word—The song each heart sang to the tuneOf hammers, through a Summer's noon,When they had wrought in that red glow,Alive, a hundred years ago— The song of girl and wife and crone,Sung in the heart of each alone . . .The dim-eyed crone with nodding head—" He's dead; and I'll, too, soon be dead."The grave-eyed mother, gaunt with need—" Another little mouth to feed! "The black-haired girl, with eyes alight—"I'll wear the yellow beads to-night." THE SHAFT THE SHAFT He must have lost his way, somehow. 'Twould seemHe'd taken the wrong turning, back a bit,After his lamp ... Or was it all a dreamThat he'd nigh reached the cage—his new lamp litAnd swinging in his hand, and whistling, gladTo think the shift was over—when he'd trippedAnd stumbled, like the daft, club-footed ladHis mother called him; and his lamp had slippedAnd smashed to smithereens; and left him thereIn pitchy dark, half-stunned, and with barked shins ?He'd cursed his luck; although he didn't care,Not overmuch ; you suffered for your sins ;And, anyway, he must be nigh the shaft;And he could fumble his way out somehow,If he were last, and none came by. 'Twas daftTo do a trick like thon.And even nowHis mother would be waiting. How she'ld laughTo hear about it! She was always gameFor fun, she was, and such a one for chaff.A fellow had no chance. But 'twas the sameWith women always; you could never tellWhat they'ld be at, or after saying next;They'd such queer, tricky tongues; and it was wellFor men to let them talk when they were vext—Although, his mother, she was seldom cross.But she'ld be wondering now, ay, that she would—Hands folded in her apron, at a lossTo know what kept him, even now she stood,Biting her lips, held warrant. She aye bit Her lips till they were white when things went wrong.She'd never liked his taking to the pit,After his father'd .. . Ay, and what a songShe'ld make . . . and supper cold ! It must be late.The last on the last shift! After to-dayThe pit was being laid idle. Jack, his mate,Had left him tidying, hurrying away,To back . . . And no night-shift . . .If that cursed lampHad not gone out . . . But that was hours ago—How many hours he couldn't tell. The crampWas in his thighs. And what could a lad knowWho'd crawled for hours upon his hands and kneesThrough miles on miles of hot, black, dripping nightOf low-roofed, unfamiliar galleries ?He'ld give a hundred pound to stand uprightAnd stretch his legs a moment: but, somehow,He'd never reached a refuge, though he'd feltThe walls on either hand. He'd bumped his browTill he was dizzy. And the heat would meltThe marrow in his bones. And yet he'd goneA dozen miles at least, and hadn't foundEven a crossway. On and on and onHe'd crawled, and crawled ; and never caught a soundSave water dripping, dripping, or the creakOf settling coal. If he could only hearHis own voice even; but he dared not speakAbove a whisper . . .There was naught to fear;And he was not afraid of aught, not he !He would come on a shaft, before he knew. He couldn't miss. The longest galleryMust end somewhere or other; though 'twas trueHe hadn't guessed the drift could be so long.If he had not come straight ... If he had turned,Unknowing, in the dark ... If he'd gone wrongOnce, then why not a dozen times! It burnedHis very heart to tinder, just to thinkThat he, maybe, was crawling round and roundAnd round and round, and hadn't caught a blinkOf light at all, or hadn't heard a sound . . .'Twas queer, gey queer . . .Or was he going daft,And only dreaming he was undergroundIn some black pit of hell, without a shaft—Just one long gallery that wound and wound,Where he must crawl for ever with the dripOf lukewarm water drumming on his back . . .'Twas nightmare, surely, had him in its grip.His head was like to split, his spine to crack . . .If he could only call, his mother'ld comeAnd shake him; and he'ld find himself in bed . . .She'ld joke his fright away . . . But he was dumb,And couldn't shout to save himself . . . His headSeemed full of water, dripping, dripping, dripping . . .And he, somehow, inside it—huge and darkHis own skull soared above him . . . He kept slipping,And clutching at the crumbling walls ... A sparkFlared suddenly; and to a blood-red blazeHis head was bursting ; and the pain would break . . .'Twas solid coal he'd run against, adaze Coal, sure enough. And he was broad awake,And crawling still through that unending driftOf some old working, long disused. He'd knownThat there were such. If he could only liftHis head a moment; but the roof of stoneCrushed low upon him. A gey narrow seamHe must be in,—and bad to work : no doubtThat's why 'twas given up. Held like to scream,His cut knees hurt so sorely; but a shoutMight bring the crumbling roof down on his head,And squash him flat.If he could only creepBetween the cool white sheets of his own bed,And turn towards the wall, and sleep, and sleep—And dream, maybe, of pigeons soaring high,Turning and tumbling in the morning light,With wings ashimmer in a cloudless sky.He'ld give the world to see a bonnie flightOf his own pigeons rise with flapping wings,Soaring and sweeping almost out of sight,Till he was dizzy, watching the mad thingsTossing and tumbling at that dazzling height.Ay, and his homers, too—if they'd come in,He hoped his mother'd fed them. They would beFair famished after such a flight, and thin.But she would feed them, sure enough; for sheLiked pigeons, too—would stand there at the doorWith arms akimbo, staring at the blue,Her black eyes shining as she watched them soar,Without a word, till they were out of view. And how she laughed to hear them scold and pout,Ruffle and fuss—like menfolk, she would say,Nobody knowing what 'twas all about,And least of all themselves. That was her way,To joke and laugh the tantrums out of him.He'ld tie his neckerchief before the glass;And she'ld call him her pigeon, Peter Prim,Preening himself, she'ld say, to meet his lass—Though he'd no lass, not he! A scarf well tied,No gaudy colours, just a red or yellow,Was what he fancied. What harm if he triedTo keep himself respectable! A fellow—Though womenfolk might laugh and laugh . . .And nowHe wondered if he'ld hear her laugh againWith hands on hips and sparkling eyes. His browSeemed clampt with red-hot iron bands; and painShot red-hot needles through his legs—his back,A raw and aching spine that bore the strainOf all the earth above him: the dead blackUnending clammy night blinding his brainTo a black blankness shot with scarlet streaksOf searing lightning; and he scarcely knewIf he'd been crawling hours, or days, or weeks . . .And now the lightning glimmered faintly blue,And gradually the blackness paled to grey:And somewhere, far ahead, he caught the gleamOf light, daylight, the very light of day,Day, dazzling day!Thank God, it was no dream.He felt a cooler air upon his face; And scrambling madly for some moments moreThough centuries it seemed, he reached the placeWhere through the chinks of the old crumbling doorOf a disused upcast-shaft, grey ghostly lightStrained feebly, though it seemed the sun's own blazeTo eyes so long accustomed to the nightAnd peering blindly through that pitchy maze.The door dropped from its hinges—and uprightHe stood, at last, bewildered and adaze,In a strange dazzling world of flowering white.Plumed snowy fronds and delicate downy sprays,Fantastic as the feathery work of frost,Drooped round him from the wet walls of the shaft—A monstrous growth of mould, huge mould. And lostIn wonder he stood gaping; and then laughedTo see that living beauty—quietlyHe laughed to see it: and awhile forgotAll danger. He would tell his mother: sheWould scarce know whether to believe or not,—But laugh to hear how, when he came on it,It dazzled him. If she could only seeThat fluffy white—come on it from the pit,Snow-white as fantails' feathers, suddenlyAs he had, she'ld laugh too: she . . .Icy coldShot shuddering through him, as he stept beneathA trickle. He looked up. That monstrous mouldFrightened him; and he stood with chattering teeth,Seeming to feel it growing over himAlready, shutting out the fleck of sky That up the slimy shaft gleamed far and dim.'T would flourish on his bones when he should lieForgotten in the shaft. Its clammy breathWas choking him already. He would die,And no one know how he'd come by his death. . .Dank, cold mould growing slowly. By and by'Twould cover him; and not a soul to tell . . .With a wild cry he tried to scramble out,Clutching the wall . . . Mould covered him ... He fell,As, close at hand, there came an answering shout.
