Borrowed Bullets By RALPH BERARD Author of "Colt-Wise--Or Plumb Loco?" etc. Cutting sign on a notch-hunter of the Jack Rabbit Kid's calibre any Range City son but Race Gordon would have thought first of the two thousand dollar reward offered for the bandit dead or alive! Race's weapon had spoken again! THE body was sprawled face down in the dust, arms out- stretched. Blood stained the dead man's shirt. The stiff whitness of the clutching hands in the early sun- light told young Race Gordon even be- fore he dismounted that the man was dead. His horse, a nervous-looking high-bred grey mare, grazed some fifty feet from the short-cut trail to Range City. Race hesitated a moment, standing there looking down at the still form. He finally stooped and turned the body over, then stepped back, startled, a wild scatter of disconnected thoughts chasing through his brain. Anyone living within a hundred miles of Range City would have recog- nized the Jack Rabbit Kid from the reward posters stuck up all over the country. Most anyone except Race Gordon would have thought first of the two thousand dollar reward offered for the bandit dead or alive. But Race thought of something else: Of the Kid's reputation, of how the Jack Rabbit Kid had fought and killed. Every man within a thousand miles was afraid of the Jack Rabbit Kid. 103
