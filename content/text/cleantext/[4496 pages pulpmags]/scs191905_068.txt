"Till Death Us Do Part" A Play in One Act By Hilliard Booth Characters Jim Raxter Lem Hamilton May Allison Granny Allison THE rising curtain shows the clean but crude interior of a cabin on Little River in the Blueridge mountains of North Caro- lina. The entrance door is at one side; opposite this is the door to the only other room of the house. Beside it is a fire-place. At rear is a small window and a closet just large enough for a man to squeeze into. A table, chairs and a bureau compose the furniture of the room. On the table stands a new straw suit-case, partly packed. It is noon of a day of the present. Granny Allison is helping her grandchild, May, fill the suit- case. Granny is a bent and withered but vigorous old lady of eighty years, dressed in drab-color homespun. May is a fresh and unusually pretty girl of eighteen years wearing her first white silk dress. Granny : I can hear the folks down by the falls; hit's almost time now, May. May: Where's my red scarf? Granny: Hit's in the bed-room. I always thought you'd marry a likelier man than Jim Raxter. May: This suit-case'll never hold my things. Granny: Jim's a steady worker and I reckon he'll make you a good husband, but I looked for you to marry a fancier man, May. And hit don't seem like you had the true bride-spirit! May : Have you got the tables spread, Granny? Granny : I'll see about 'em directly. There's a crowd of folks to feed; seems as if the whole district had come to see the wedding under High Falls. That was a pretty idea of yours, being married under the falls, May--hit's like being married in the lap of God. I never did hold for house-weddings. But I al- ways thought you'd marry Lem Hamil- ton. S.--May--5 65
