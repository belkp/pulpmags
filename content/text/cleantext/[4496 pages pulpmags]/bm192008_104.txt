There was a girl--her name is of no moment--a girl of wondrous beauty and celestial character, who did stagger my resolution for a brief spell. When I felt myself weaken- ing I went to Bellevue Hospital where I knew a house surgeon, and walked through the wards. The Law of Compensation was operating on high gear that evening. I finished my tour, had a good laugh and never saw her again. So this is the last night. I feel strangely happy. For my final re- past I have ordered a royal gorge. I shall dine heartily at midnight and drink many a glass of rare vintage to the vanquished Law of Compen- sation. Then to bed for a few hours of calm rest. After that, tomorrow morning and 7:32.

The matter I am send- ing you was, I presume, a literary effort on his part.
