This New Easy Way I DON'T care what you are now or what you think. The Association of which I am president will take you in short, easy steps and make a Master Salesman of you, put you in the same class with the big pay men who have all the good things of life, Many have thought that Salesmen were "born." And that idea has kept many men from succeeding. But this Association of Master Salesmen has proved that any man can be taught the rules and principles that make men Master Salesmen. And you know as well as I do that Salesmen top the list of moneymakers. They are the producers and you can lie one of them. Easy as A, B, C If you are as intelligent as the ordinary mechanic, postal clerk or stenographer, you can quickly master the simple A, B, C,'s of Selling. There arc certain ways of approaching a prospect to get his undivided attention, certain ways to stimulate keen interest, certain ways to overcome objections, batter down prejudices, outwit competition and make the prospect act. You can learn these principles at home in a short period of pleasant, inspiring study. And once you have mastered these secrets of Master Salesmanship, you can take advantage of the employment department of the Association without charge. They will help you select and secure a position as soon as you are qualified and ready. This is a real opportunity, for during the last year the Association received calls for 49,880 salesmen from the biggest sales organizations in America. And these men are the same as you see above -- men who make from $5,000 to $10,000 a year in salary and commission. These are only four out of hundreds of similar records in the Association files.
