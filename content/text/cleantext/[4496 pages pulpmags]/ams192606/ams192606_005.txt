COPYRIGHT ACKNOWLEDGMENT "A Trip to the Center of the Earth," by Jules Verne, copyright 1911, by Vincent Parke &amp; Co., (Parke, Austin &amp; Lipscomb Co.) In Our Next Issue: "STATION X," by G. McLeod Winsor. A wonderful radio serial describing in vivid language a titanic struggle between Lunarians and Martians, waged by the development of future means of warfare. A tale of hair-raising terror and suspense. "THE EGGS FROM LAKE TANGANYIKA," by Curt Siodmak. A new German.story which we consider the best scientifiction short story for 1926. It is the cleverest and, without doubt, the most amazing thing that we have seen in years. "THE MOON METAL," by Professor Garret P. Serviss. One of the greatest scientifiction stories ever written, with a most astonishing and intriguing plot that will hold your interest to the end. "DR. OX'S EXPERIMENT," by Jules Verne. A little-known but amazing scientifiction story, wherein a sleepy to\fcn suddenly bursts forth in an amazing fashion. "THE MAGNETIC STORM," by Hugo Gernsback. The inner secret of how the Great World War was really won by Tesla currents--if you can believe this unusual story. "THE SCIENTIFIC ADVENTURES OF MR. FOSDICK," by Jacque Morgan, wherein "The Feline Light &amp; Power Company" is organized, and in which you will again meet the great inventor in a most mirth-provoking story. "THE SPHINX," by Edgar Allan Poe. A little-known story by the great writer, which again shows how our senses are sometimes fooled by the simplest of things. Another powerful story by H. G. Wells, which is little known in this country. A story which you will read and re-read many times. "DR. HACKENSAW'S SECRETS," by Clement Fezandie. The secret of "The Invisible Girl." This new Hackensaw story is as astonishing as its predecessors. and shows you what happened when the hunters tried to locate the invisible girl. An excellent short story.
