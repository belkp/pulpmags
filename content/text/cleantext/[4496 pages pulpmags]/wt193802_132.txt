COMING NEXT MONTH PLACING his two enormous, shapeless hands on the table, Dmitri heaved himself to his feet,[and] a tremendous bellow issued from his barrel-like chest. That summons, though the words were[lost] in a gulf of sound, was unmistakable, and presently the door opened and the little man, prim[ and] neat and wholly a colorless personality, entered. "Yes, Master." Dmitri stood beside the table, his right hand resting heavily on the polished oak. "Sit down, little Stepan." The small man, the ghost of a pleased smile on his peasant face, sat down primly in the o[aken] chair and looked about the room with child-like pleasure. Obviously he was enjoying to the utter[most] his small moment. "You would prefer the sleep, little one? It is not necessary; we have been through this experi[ment] many times together, you and I." "I would prefer the sleep, Master," the little man said, with a slight shudder. "Despite my[self] my eyes flinch from the flame--" "Very well." Dmitri's voice was casual and low. "Relax, little one, and sleep. Sleep soundly--["] He turned from his servant and picked up the fifty-cent piece. Turning it over and over i[n the] fingers of his left hand he began to speak, slowly. "I have told this subject's subconscious that its body is invulnerable to physical injury. Watch[!"] The little man was sitting erect in the massive chair. His eyes were closed, his face immo[bile.] Dmitri stooped, lifted an arm, let it fall, then straightened triumphantly and surveyed his silent [audi-] ence. Suddenly, then, a roaring streamer of bluish flame lanced across the room. Dmitri had set [the] gasoline torch alight. A woman was babbling hysterically. But above the steady moan of the flame Dmitri said lou[dly] "There is no cause for alarm. Now, observe closely. I am going to go far beyond the ordinary h[ypno] tist's procedure-" He carefully picked up, with the pliers, the fifty-cent piece. For a long moment he let the moa[ning] flame play on the coin, until both coin and plier-tips glowed angrily. Calmly, without warning, he dropped the burning coin on his servant's naked wrist! A woman screamed. But, then, gasps of relief eddied from the tense audience. For, although [the] glowing whiteness of the coin had scarcely begun to fade into cherry-red, the man Stepan had show[n no] sign that he felt pain! There was no stench of burning flesh in the room. Even the fine hairs on [the] back of the servant's wrist, hairs that touched and curled delicately above the burning coin, showed [not] the slightest sign of singeing! . . .
