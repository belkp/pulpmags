Behold! he sees what no human eye has glimpsed since the beginning of time He might have stepped from the frame of a Rem- brandt painting, this bewigged figure of a man so patiently making lenses and squinting through them. Night after night, like a child with a new toy, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, seventeenth century Dutch shopkeeper, hurried home to place anything and every- thing under his microscope: the brain of a fly, rain water, a hair, pepper, a cow's eye, scrapings from his teeth. Then one day, behold! he sees what no human eye has glimpsed since the beginning of time. Fantastic "little animals", thousands of them to a pin-point, dart and squirm as he gazes. Not for an instant did he suspect any of them as foes of mankind, as possible destroyers of health and life. But the enemy had at last been sighted. Man had taken his first faltering step in the war on germs. Nearly two hundred years were to pass before the second step, a giant stride, was taken by Pasteur. He devoted his life to seeking out the microbes which he believed to be the cause of disease. In turn, his work inspired Lister to use carbolic acid in combating the almost inevitable gangrene which then followed surgery. Soon Lister's fame as "the father of antiseptic sur- gery" spread across the Atlantic. No wonder that when a new, non-caustic, non-poisonous antiseptic and germicide was discovered in St. Louis, its sponsors named it Listerine, in his honor. Today the shining bottle and amber color of Listerine Antiseptic are as familiar to millions of people as the face of a long trusted friend. In more than sixty years of service in the fight on infection, it has day after day proved deadly to germs but harmless to tissue . . . well meriting its almost universal citation as "the safe antiseptic and germicide."
