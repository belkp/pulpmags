Secret Fires Secret fires yield a warmth Sweet and passionate With the longing and desire Born of destined fate, Drawing in their magic spell Hearts that throb and burn With the joy and ecstasy Seeking full return. Secret fires seal the lips With emotion's thrall, Language has no words that breathe Love's instinctive call. Fervent hands and yearning arms Ever find their goal In silent eloquence Binding soul to soul. Secret fires are aflame In my heart for you, Shining, glowing like the lights Which are woven through Priceless diamonds where all gems Merge and blend as one In the passioned radiance Of the moon and sun. Franklin Pierce Carrigan.
