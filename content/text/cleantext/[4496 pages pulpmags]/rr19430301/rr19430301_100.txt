Stars of the Arena Joe Welch Roper and Bronc-Rider   JOE WELCH, one of our top rodeo contestants, was born and raised in Carlsbad, New Mexico, and was content with making the shows around his home town till the bug really bit him in 1930. The first rodeo where he cashed in big was at Roswell, New Mexico, when he won both the roping and bronc-riding. From then on he couldn't stay put. So he decided to come to New York and try his luck at the Garden. In the fall of 1930 he won the calf-roping and bareback bronc-riding there, and that's going some when you have the cream of the rodeo world to compete against.  At the Twin Falls, Idaho, rodeo he won the calf-roping and in 1931-2-3 the all-around cowboy title at Soda Springs, Idaho. Later the same title was his at North Platte, Nebraska, and numerous other titles have come his     way since he left the old homestead at Carlsbad.  Joe is a neighbor of Elmer Helper, a top-hand who quit the rodeo game to run his own ranch. It looks as if the game would lose Joe one of these days, too. He's already deputy sheriff at Carlsbad under Sheriff Hal Gage, and likely it's only a question of time till he becomes sheriff.  While at the Cavalcade Billy Rose staged at Fort Worth, Texas, Joe met Lotama Hilburn and they quietly eloped to Marietta, Oklahoma. They have two sweet kids--Jim, two and a half, and Jan, one and a half. Jim al- ready rides his own horse.  At the opening night in the Garden this fall Joe made the fastest time in both bulldogging and calf-roping. He roped his calf in sixteen seconds flat and threw his steer in thirteen. Tex Sherman   97
