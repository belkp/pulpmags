Primitive Love 123 them one by one with swift, tender little kisses. Bobbie was thinking of that now, of the love in his eyes, that had washed from them all the cruelty, selfishness and greed. She was thinking of Hulda and Nolan, a sobered, chastened, fright- ened Nolan- a Nolan with the money she had given him in his pocket, and Hulda by his side. She was thinking of the ranch her father owned out West, where Hulda was to take him, and where her love would guide him. And because she was afraid to think of Red- afraid for the very agony of joy that filled her- she thought, of her father instead, not of the bonus he had lost, but of the friendship he had won. She thought of old Sandy, fighting shoul- der to shoulder with Tim, sweating, chewing, swearing. And, turning at the sound of footsteps on the path, she saw them coming toward her, dimly at first, as though out of a dream, with the mist swaying and swirling about them. There was Sandy and her father, arm in arm. There was old Tim, limping a little, but grinning up at her, his bleary old eyes squinting with the burn of smoke and dust. And there was Red, tall and straight against the gray of the morning sky, his blue eyes shining, his bandages dragging crazily. He was holding out his arms and smiling to her, and suddenly the walls were reeling, the floor was swaying, and she was clutching wildly at nothing at all.
