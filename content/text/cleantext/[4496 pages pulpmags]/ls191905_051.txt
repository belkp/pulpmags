Ballade of Lost Faces By Richard Le Gallienne   FAIR is the face we call our own, And fair the faces on the street. Ah, but they leave the heart alone. Speeding to trysts on happy feet. Remotely fair, for others sweet; And, with a sudden touch of frost, We think of those we used to meet-- The faces we have loved and lost.  Once they, as these, as brightly shone. Under their laces the same beat Of eager pulses hurrying on-- O why such haste! O why so fleet!-- To leave the story incomplete; Dreams, are ye worth the ache you cost? No loveliest face can e'er repeat The faces we have loved and lost.  The friends, the comrades, we have known. So brave and laughing once to greet. They too are dim and ghostly grown. Chap-fallen they, and most discreet; Their jests are long since obsolete. Their goodness on the four winds tossed. And fallen cold their generous heat-- The faces we have loved and lost.  Envoi  Prince, there upon thy mercy seat, Shall some great day of Pentecost Summon them from their winding-sheet-- The faces we have loved and lost?  48
