Forsaken 81   She shuddered, and lifted her hand to her throat as if to quell a nausea. Then she cried out:  "Oh, Valentine, don't despise me!"  With misty eyes, he crossed over to her chair and laid his hand upon her bowed head.  "Despise you!" he murmured, with a twisted smile. "I honor you--I wor- ship you!"  After an interval he continued:  "Allie, I know you haven't forgotten that delectable inn you told me about last May--that inn on the road of life where you hoped we might meet some day at sunset."  "It's sunset--for me," she moaned. "But I see no inn."  "May not this be it, in disguise--as so many blessed havens are?" he asked tenderly.     "I'm so dusty and bedraggled that I'm not fit to enter."  "At any inn on the King's Highway, all are welcome. There is an attendant to bathe and anoint the feet of the weary. And the Lord of the inn has fresh apparel for them."  She gave a sob and clung to his hand.  "But I had expected to meet you joy- ously, with courage in my heart and a staff in my hand--a meet companion for the journey."  "This is sunset, remember," said he. "A night of rest and refreshment inter- venes. At sunrise all will be different."  She lifted her dark eyes, glistening with tears, and peered into his search- ingly.  "I had forgotten there would be a sunrise, sweetheart. There wouldn't be --if you hadn't come."    FORSAKEN By Will Thompson TEN lakhs of gold has my loved one in his palace; Two golden thrones in his Summer Island Palace; Peacocks and boys, and a caravan of dresses; Three lotus-lakes, which the morning sun caresses.  Sad is my heart, sad and lonely in its palace; Gone is my love from his Summer Island Palace; Past like the wind, which its fickleness confesses. Scattering the rose, which the morning sun caresses.  6--L.S.
