Heredity  By T. F. Mitchell HIS great grandfather on one side had translated the Bible into the Polyne- sian. His grandfather had been a Baptist minister. His father had worked earnestly for Prohibition. His grandfather, on the other side, had converted thousands of happy heathens to Methodism. His aunt had found happiness in many moral crusades. With an ancestry such as this it was inevitable that heredity should show itself. He kept the police of two continents busy.     Nocturne  By Jean Allen  UP from the shore, Across the windy downs, Night followed us In trailing robes of thin soft blue. The croon of the sea was about our ears: The tang of the wet wind stung our faces: And the path led over the hill To the stars. Between the clasp of your hand and mine, Lay trust, As deep as the sky: And in my heart, Love, A shining flame, As steadfast as the island light, Circling great arms Towards infinite space.   MARRIAGE is the surest device in the world for proving to a man that he is always wrong.  82
