LOST LOVE 81    "The same kind of part?" She nodded again.  "Why? Do you have to? You must have got a pretty decent alimony."  "I did."  I waited for an explanation, but none came until a week later when I again ran across her in the street. She was looking prettier and faster and smarter than ever, and this time she came up to me.  "Hello, there!"  "Hello, Suzanne. Haven't seen you for some time."  "No? Have you been in town?"  "No."  "Did you sell the story?"  "I didn't write it."  "Why not?"  "Because you never finished it for me"  "Oh!" she laughed.  I didn't care how many people saw me with her that day. She was stun- ning!--and, anyway, my friends were mostly out of town.     "How are you?" I ventured.  "Well. And you?"  "The same."  We walked on, silent.  "You look like the old Suzanne, all right."  "I am."  We must have gone another block without a word. Finally she said:  "Do you go on wild parties any more ?"  "No," I answered.  She gave me a kind glance and took my arm. Her question had reminded me of my own unhappiness, and she understood.  "Why do you ask?" I queried.  "Because I was going to ask you to come with us tonight."  "Who'll be there?"  "Four men," we walked ten steps, "and Curtis."  I saw the situation. We walked the rest of the quiet way arm in arm.  And, when we parted, we were both a bit sad.     The Right Thing  By Frank La Forrest JONES was not a brilliant man; some would call him stupid. Yet he had one predominant quality. He was never caught napping. No matter what happened--good or bad--he had something to say. He had a comment for everything. He always said, "Damn." NO woman is hopeless so long as she can laugh at her husband.  S. S.--Dec. 6
