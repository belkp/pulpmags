SCRAMBLED YEGGS By ART NUNCE A LITTLE Frenchman at the office of the Bal de Legion d' Honeur was adamant. His waxed black mous- tache danced excitedly on his upper lip. Indigo eyes sparkled. "I am sorry, Monsieur," he re- peated. "I cannot do nossing for you! Zere is not one ticket to zee Bal! Zey have all been taken by zee Legion d' Honeur and zere guests. I am sorry." Eddie Quince gave vent to a labial noise closely approximating the fa- miliar Bronx cheer. "Nuts !" he mut- tered. "I beg your pardon, Monsieur," the little Frenchman said. "Forget it, Froggie. You're sure you can't get me into the shindig? I'm a gentleman of the press." A pained expresson floated over the Frenchman's face. "If I could, Mon- sieur, I would be tres happy. But, Mon Dieu, what can I do? Zee members and zere friends have all zee tickets."
