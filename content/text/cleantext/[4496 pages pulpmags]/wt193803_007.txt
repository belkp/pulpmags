260 WEIRD TALES from th' doorpost of his bedroom wid his bathrobe girdle knotted around 'is neck an' about a mile o' tongue sthickin' out. Suicide? Sure, an' what else could it be wid a felly found sthrung up in a tight-locked flat like that? "Then, widin a week there comes a call fer us to take it on th' lam up to th' house where Stanley Trivers lived. There he is, a-layin' on his bathroom floor wid a cut across 'is throat that ye could put yer foot into, a'most. In his pajammies he is, an' th' blood's run down an' spoilt 'em good an' proper. Suicide again? Well, maybe so an' maybe no, fer in all me time I've niver seen a suicidal cut across a felly's throat that was as deep where it wound up as where it stharted. They mostly gits remorse afore th' cut is ended, as ye know, an' th' pressure on th' knife gits less an' less; so th' cut's a whole lot shal- lower at th' end than 'twas at th' begin- nin'. However, th' coroner says it's sui- cide, so suicide it is, as far as we're con- cerned. Anyhow, gintlemen, in both these cases th' dead men wuz locked in their houses, from th' inside, as wus plain by th' keys still bein' in th' locks. "Now comes th' third one. 'Tis this Donald Atkins felly, over to th' Kensing- ton Apartments. Sthretched on th' floor he is, wid a hole bored in 'is forehead an' th' blood a-runnin' over everything. He's on 'is back wid a pearl-stocked pistol in 'is hand. Suicide again, says Schultz, me partner, an' I'm not th' one ter say as how it ain't, all signs pointin' as they do, still --" He paused and puffed at his cigar till its gray tip glowed with sullen rose. Jules de Grandin tweaked a needle- sharp mustache tip. "Tell me, my ser- geant," he commanded, "what is it you have withheld? Somewhere in the history of these cases is a factor you have not re- vealed, some denominator common to them all which makes your police instinct doubt your senses' [e]vidence--" "How'd ye guess it, sor?" the big Irish- man looked at him admiringly. "Ye've put yer finger right upon it, but-- He stifled an embarrassed cough, then, turning slightly red: "'Tis th' perfume, sor, as makes me wonder." "Perfume?" the little Frenchman ech- oed. "What in Satan's foul name--" "Well, sor, I ain't one o' them as sees a woman's skirts a-hidin' back of ivery crime, though you an' I both knows there's mighty few crimes committed that ain't concerned wid cash or women, savin' when they're done fer both. But these here cases have me worried. None o' these men wuz married, an', so far as I've found out, none o' them wuz kapin' steady company, yet--git this, sor; 'tis small, but maybe it's important--there wuz a smell o' perfume hangin' round each one of 'em, an' 'twas th' same in ivery case. No sooner had I got a look at this pore Eldridge felly hangin' like a joint o' beef from his own doorpost than me nose begins a-twitchin'. Wuz he a pansy, maybe?' I wonders when I smelt it first, for 'twas no shavin' lotion or toilet water, but a woman's heavy scent, strong an' swate an'--what's it that th' ads all say?--distinctive. Yis, sor, that's th' word fer it, distinctive. Not like anything I've smelt before, but kind o' like a mixin' up o' this here ether that they use ter put a man ter slape before they takes 'is leg off, an' kind o' like th' incense they use in church, an' maybe there wuz sumpin mixed wid it that wasn't perfume afther all, sumpin that smelt rank an' sickly- like, th' kind o' smell ye smell when they takes a floater from th' bay, sor. "Well, I looks around ter see where it's a-comin' from, an' it's strongest in th' bedroom; but divil a sign o' any woman bein' there I find, 'ceptin' fer th' smell o' perfume. "So when we runs in on th' Trivers suicide, an' I smells th' same perfume
