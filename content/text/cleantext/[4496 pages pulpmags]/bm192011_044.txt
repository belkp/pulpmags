The Unbelievable 41 "Now tell us when and where you last saw Mr. Okawa's cane." "In the restaurant at luncheon on the day of the murder. It was the occa- sion upon, which we made the appoint- ment to meet in his rooms that night. He was leaving without it. When he remembered it,' and as I was nearer to it than he, he asked me to hand it to him." "Which you did--and left your finger- prints on the handle." Song Kee rose and bowed like a show- man finished with his exhibition.' At once everyone in the room began to talk, plying him with questions. The jangling of the telephone brought a tardy silence. Commissioner Oglethorpe an- swered it. "Yes ? Good God! Go on, go on! He, left a jfote ? Read it." Oglethorpe hung up the receiver with a bang. He turned to his companions and said gravely: "Sito Okawa killed himself in the Ralston Hotel last night. A note was found beside his body saying that he had killed Irene Grenville to avenge the dishonored name of his family." Everyone except Song Kee and De- laney stared fixedly at the Commission- er, Delaney was watching the China- man, who was standing unmoved and unperturbed, looking out of the win- dow. "Say, Mr. Song Kee," the detective said grimly. "What did you have to do with this last ?" Song Kee shrugged. "Perhaps nothing--perhaps every- thing," he answered. "I don't know. Last night when I went to his room I left a message. It was to the effect that it would be unfitting that the person of one of the Samurai be held in bondage and punished by foreigners even in the enforcement of their laws. ... It may be that he understood."
