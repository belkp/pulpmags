BORROWED BULLETS 109 about getting the Jack Rabbit Kid. Suppose you killed him this time?" A low satirical laugh followed the words. Then Race's teeth snapped together and his right hand clutched a gun han- dle. He recognized Gatz Blemming's voice. "Don't guess I killed him," Shanto was saying. "But he swayed a lot in the saddle and he didn't follow ... he spurred out o' range mighty pronto." Blemming's mocking laugh rose louder. "Ya slipped, Shanto. Ya al- most admitted he didn't follow when ya ran away." The Jack Rabbit Kid's guns came into Race's hands again, their ivory handles feeling warm and friendly in his grasp. Their long barrels crashed the remaining glass of the window. He stepped inside and faced the men at the table. Shanto's coal black eyes flashed mixed hatred and fear. He saw the black mask. He recognized the Jack Rabbit Kid's guns. The roomful of men stood watching. Tense. Eager. But hesitant. Gatz Blemming was watching, his hand near his gun, but making no effort to raise it. Race let a quick glance sweep the room. He saw the crowd standing si- lent, motionless, like tintype pictures of men. Sheriff Ballard stepped suddenly out from the others and began to move forward. Race swung around to face the law- man. He let the muzzles of his guns drop down, dropped the weapons them- selves back to their holsters. He felt the cold crease of his grin come back on his face as a plan came to his mind and he watched with the tail of his eye to see Shanto slowly snaking out his gun. He felt rather than saw Gatz Blemming shift in his chair. The sher- iff was still a dozen paces away and Blemming didn't want the Jack Rab- bit Kid to be taken alive. BEAUTY, LOVE, Etc.
