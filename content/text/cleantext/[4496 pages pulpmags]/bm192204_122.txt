Pink Ears 119 look at the bonds and make sure they were safe. All I had to do was take Murph--O'Ryan by the hand and wait two minutes and then swing in the door and pull a flash-pistol. I had Craig neatly mugged with the bonds in his hands. Could I jug him, I ask you ?" "You could," agreed the desk-ser- geant. "But you keep saying all along that you knew he'd hidden out the bonds. How'd you know that?" "His ears were pink," said Jamison wearily. "If you saw a man who'd just been robbed of a fortune, you'd expect him to look sort of pale, wouldn't you ?" "I would that." "This man was made up pretty good. His eyes looked sunk way back in his head, and he was pale to just the right extent. He put over the voice stuff pretty well, too. He'd made himself up with number one dead white, that- he carried in his shaving-soap tube, but he'd left his ears pink, a nice, healthy pink. And I had only to take one look to know what was up." "'Twas careless," said the desk- sergeant. "Careless? It was criminal!" Jami- son seemed to be mourning over the decay of crime. "I haven't had a real good case in a coon's age. Crooks haven't got brains any more." And he shook his head in the most abysmal gloom.
