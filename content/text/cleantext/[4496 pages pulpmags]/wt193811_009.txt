Man Can Now Talk With God Says Noted Psychologist "A new and revolutionary religious teaching based entirely on the misunderstood sayings of the Galilean Carpenter, and designed to show how we may find, understand and use the same identical power which Jesus used in performing His so-called Miracles," is attracting world- wide attention to its founder, Dr. Frank B. Robinson, noted Psychologist, author and lec- turer. "Psychiana," this new psychological religion, believes and teaches that it is today possible for every normal human being, understanding spiritual law as Christ understood it, "to du- plicate every work that the Carpenter of Galilee ever did"--it believes and teaches that when He said, "the things that I do shall ye do also." He meant what He said and meant it literally to all mankind, through all the ages. Dr. Robinson has prepared a 6,000 word treatise on "Psychiana," in which he tells about his long search for the Truth, how he finally came to the full realization of an Unseen Power or force "so dynamic in itself that all other powers and forces fade into insignificance be- side it"--how he learned to commune directly with the Living God, using this mighty, never- failing power to demonstrate health, happiness and financial success and how any normal being may find and use it as Jesus did. He is now offering this treatise free to every reader of this magazine who writes him. If you want to read this "highly interesting, revolutionary and fascinating story of the dis- covery of a great Truth," just send your name and address to Dr. Frank B. Robinson, 418-- 11th Street, Moscow, Idaho. It will be sent free and postpaid without cost or obligation. Write the Doctor today.--Copyright, 1935, Dr. Frank B. Robinson.
