O Woman! Woman! By M. A. Hitchcock SAM was very much sur- prised when he heard of the broken engagement of his friend, Billy, and a charming young woman ac- quaintance, and condemned Billy when he learned that he was the cause of it. I understand that you broke off the engagement," said Sam. "I don't see how you could treat Florence so shabbily. "Oh, it wasn't done at all brutally," replied Billy. "I managed it very di- plomatically!" "How?" queried Sam. "Why," explained Billy, "I just sim- ply told her what my salary is." One Day in May By Will Thompson ONE day in May, of cloudless blue, You took my hand beside the brook; And where brown bees the cowslips knew, Into your eyes you bade me look. Of cloudless blue the mid-spring sky; Wild lilies hung their blushing bells Beside the brook that rippled by; The crinkled ferns waved in the dells. One day in May we sought the shrine That love had made; and where brown bees Buzzed in the sun, I let you twine A crown of pale anemones. I trusted you; you took my hand; And I was glad, nor felt surprise. The cowslips knew what May had planned-- You bade me look into your eyes.
