My Road to the Stars By a Girl Who Ran Away to the Movies Pam has run away to go in the movies. Ted Bromley, a chance acquaintance, has painted a glowing picture for her of what the future may hold, once she reaches the studios. Her case is different from that of the usual movie-struck girl only in that she is the daughter of stage people. And she has a further motive for going--to escape Mark, whom she is being forced to marry in order to keep her grandfather's modest estate all in the family. She is a little afraid to go away with Ted--but she does. He behaves toward her with the utmost consideration. But their train is wrecked. A woman in a near by farmhouse takes Pam in, and asks the name of her people, in order to write them. Pam is terrified--maybe she'll have to go back, and marry Mark. Adam, the son of the house, slips in and tells her that her cousin has arrived--is in the front room. He wants to run away with Pam: asks her to marry him. Pam catches the trolley, just in time to escape Adam-- as well as her disagreeable Cousin Martha. She works in a neighboring town, until she saves money enough to reach New York. She goes to a studio just across the river, and is given a chance for Ted Bromley's sake. Everybody speaks of him in the past tense--especially Gloria Mundi, the star, who after Pam has innocently spoiled a scene for her, demands that the new "extra" be discharged. Bryam Hogan, the chief, however, keeps Pam. One day she learns Ted Bromley is still living--though he has an injured spine that affects his sight and also his understanding. She takes a room adjoining his, in order to take care of him. The landlady tells her he will not last long. I CAREFULLY pushed back the bolt and, opening the door gently, I stared in. The room was about the same size as mine but it reeked with fumes of alcohol. It was furnished with only a bend, a bureau, and one chair. I turned my eyes and gazed at the wreck of the man who lay there. 67
