Myrilla thrust the pistol into her bloomer pocket and held out her arms to her erstwhile lover. "Come away with me, dear," she pleaded. "I have enough laid by for two." "You forget," said Bertie with quiet dignity, moving nearer to his wife. "Prude!" sneered the burglaress. "You know you love me." He remained silent. "You do," boasted Myrilla. "And she noticed your hesitancy in denying it." "I do not," he disputed, paling. Vi- sioning what the future held, he was, for an instant, tempted to flee the wrath to come.
