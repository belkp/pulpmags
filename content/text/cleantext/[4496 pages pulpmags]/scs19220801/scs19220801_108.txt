Her Friend, the Burglar 105 and daughter ever pried him loose from a cent. And I sort of figured that maybe yon were monkeying about that safe because you needed a little extra change yourself. So I beat it over to Kenyon's home and took a look in the safe in his li- brary. Say--the old boy had $1,000 in there! So I just lifted it and closed the safe again, and I don't suppose he even knows it's gone. Doris gave a little gasp, and then her eyes twinkled as she thought of Ken- yon's fury when he should learn the truth. Of course there was nothing more he could do with her, but she did not care to be in town when he made the discovery. He would be mad enough to chew nails for days to come. She went on with the note: When I found you'd been locked up, I worked that "brother" stunt; and because Kenyon would do any- thing for a hundred dollars, he fell for it hard. Of course he didn't know it was his own century note I sent him. by messenger. Too bad --but he wouldn't see the joke. I'm enclosing four hundred dollars. Thai's your half of the swag--less the hundred iron men it took to get you out of jail. Take it and have a good time. Yon didn't steal it. ft's a gift from your admiring friend, the Burglar. For a minute or two, Doris hesitated. Then she stuffed the note and the bills into her stocking and began to pack up. Four hundred dollars would buy a lot of the things in that mail-order catalog and give her a longer vacation at the shore. There was a train out of town at eleven fifty-six, and Doris proposed to take it. But as she went about her prep- arations, she wondered whether the bur- glar would, by any chance, be at the sea- side hotel. It would be fun if they could laugh together over the joke on old Kenyon.
