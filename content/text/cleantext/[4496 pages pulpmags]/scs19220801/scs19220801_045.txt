Checked! ByIrving Kenwood "A H-HA!" exclaimed my wife, as she gingerly picked a hair from my coat sleeve. I didn't like the tone of that "Ah-ha"; it didn't have the pleasant flavor of humor in it. It had more the soothing quality of a meat-axe to it. "Brown as usual," I said, trying to put the old nonchalance into it. "Brown's my favorite hair. Some day, honey, you're going to find another woman's hair on my coat and then I suppose I'll get--well, I'll catch it." "Who is she?" said my wife without a bit of amusement. "Who's who?" "The owner of that hair!" she snapped. "Come, come, dear, you've had your joke," I said. "That's your own. Look at the color." "Color nothing," she retorted. "Look at the length!" I did. It was about eighteen inches long. Then I realized the terrible mess I was in. My wife had just had her's bobbed and the longest hair in her head wasn't more than six inches. "You've played me for a sucker, eh? You show me the door and throw me out like a dog--I'll get even with you for this!" said the angry theatrical producer to the ingenue, Elinor Faris. Did he get even? Or did the girl outwit him? You'll find out if you read "When Dealing with a Woman--" in SAUCY STORIES for August 15th. 42
