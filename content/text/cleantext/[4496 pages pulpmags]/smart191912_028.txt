WHAT IS ISN'T 21   He was picking up his hat. Then he moved towards the door. But on the threshold he halted and turned.  "Send for Lilligore," he advised, "He's a better lawyer than I dare ever [h]ope to be. If any fellow can pull you [t]hrough he can."  And he was gone.  It was Marvin Lilligore who repre- [se]nted Calvert at the Coroner's inquest when he was held for the Grand Jury. And it was Marvin Lilligore who, as at- torney of record, applied for a tran- script of the Grand Jury minutes after Calvert was indicted. For, im- possible as such an eventuality had seemed to him, knowing his own inno- cence, the prosecution had experienced [li]ttle difficulty in establishing a prima [fac]ie case.  The newspapers, meanwhile, had made all the capital possible out of Owen Wills's withdrawal, aided and [a]betted in this by the Holland office. Wills, they pointed out, was the accused man's most intimate friend--for years [th]ey had been closer than brothers-- [a]nd Calvert had retained him immedi- [at]ely following his arrest. For twenty- four hours Wills had worked assidu- [ou]sly and then, for some reason which [co]uld only be surmised, seeing that [ei]ther he nor the prisoner nor the [priso]ner's present counsel would throw [an]y light on the matter, he had precipi- [t]ely withdrawn.  The situation, anomalous as it ap- peared at first glance, was not so diffi- cult of solution as some seemed to im- agine. (So one of the "yellows" put it [edi]torially.) There were many prece- ants for Mr. Wills's course. Indeed, was not the first time that he himself [ha]d so acted. In the Majendie case, it [mi]ight be remembered, he had done pre- [cis]ely the same thing. And it was ex- [am]ined at that time to be due to a dis- [agr]eement with his client as to the pol- [icy] of defense. Mr. Wills was an able []ist and jealous of his reputation-- [a]nd so on, and so on, with the effect of the distinct impression that so [pre]carious was Calvert's position that Wills, who knew him best, could see     hope of acquittal in but one direction.  In spite of this, however, and the whole combined campaign to try the case in the press, there was no word of denial or even of protest from either the Wills or the Lilligore office.  Early in November Bianca, masquer- ading under her maiden name and ac- companied by Marie, had gone to At- lantic City. Dr. Vanderslice had so advised. And there, with Marvin Lil- ligore as intermediary, a daily exchange of letters with Lee Calvert had been es- tablished.  Than this she could have had no bet- ter medicine. Under its stimulus her nerves strengthened and, by degrees, her lost poise was re-established. For weeks--ever since that morning when Sarah Rhysdael had so ill-advisedly hurled at her the crushing fact of mur- der and arrest--doubt and apprehen- sion had been her hourly companions. Her power to reason had been woefully crippled. Three sentences of Lee Cal- vert's had echoed and reechoed with condemning emphasis:  "My conscience isn't so sensitive."  "I nearly had the willies waiting."  "If hating would kill Elliot Holland he'd be dead this minute."  And with each repetition her torture had increased.  Calvert's first letter, however, did much to exorcise these dread phan- toms. Her vision slowly cleared. Dimly she began to see. And with each succeeding communication her sense of proportion grew, until she marveled over her recent blindness. Lee wrote her of Owen Wills's defection and of his retention of Marvin Lilligore. Of the latter he said: "I have every confi- dence in him. He's a bigger man than Owen, and when he promises me ac- quittal, as he does every time I see him, I know that he'll accomplish it."  Bianca furiously resented Owen's course. She knew him and had liked him. But with reservations. He was capricious, inconsistent, impulsive; and she could never quite reconcile Lee's unqualified admiration for him. Nev- ertheless, she felt that nothing could
