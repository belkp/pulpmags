A Strange Trail  By Clinton Dangerfield   Courage such as Molly Wardell possessed comes to but a few brave hearts, and surely Molly should have as mate a man whose valor equalled hers. Molly thought she had made such a choice, until she took that strange trail that led to new and untried dangers.     A DOZEN of the Diamond D geld- ings, half wild from long dis- use, galloped unwillingly toward the gaping mouth of the home corral, forced on by Molly Wardell and her father. Wardell's stern blue eyes softened as he watched the careless ease of his daughter's riding.  "Knee grip as good as a man's," thought Wardell, "and no other girl half as pretty in this whole damn county!" Molly caught his glance and flashed an eager, happy smile at him. Nothing delighted her more than aiding in the recapture of horses needed for the re- muda. She whirled her mount, cutting off the escape of a plunging gray, then gave a triumphant whoopee as the bunch streamed into the corral. Before her father could leave his saddle she     sprang down, put up the bars, then leaned against them, laughing at him.  "Beat yuh to it, Dad! Don't yuh think I'm just as good as Lin at round- ing 'em up?"  "Lin?" muttered her father, suddenly frowning. "Molly, he claims you two will marry soon as he gets back from Mexico with them cattle. That true?" She nodded assent, her lovely sun- bronzed face serious now. "Molly, Lin Derry's temper has showed up plumb hellish in the past two years. I've had to pay him out of lots of trouble 'count of it. Oh, yeah! I know he's never showed you no temper--a man don't in courtin' days."  She seized on a chance to change the subject. "Look, Dad! Yonder comes a rider, toppin' that rise!"   53
