A Laureate 95    "He came as close to jail as he ever will come and keep out of it," I said grimly. "By the way, sir, what about those two colored boys, Minogue and Johnson, who are said to have disap- peared?"  The old gentleman smiled.  "You'll find them down at Roanoke," he said. "I played the god from the machine there. Both had scolding wives and wanted to get away. They had worked for me, and I gave them money. They rowed down the canal into the Cheasapeake and forgot to mention to anyone where they were going. They sent me the money I lent them some months ago."  "What about that infernal Devil's Tree, Uncle?" asked Jim. "You're not going to leave it here, I hope."  "If you and Drake will take a couple of those dynamite cartridges you'll find     in the closet in my room and plant a little mine near the thing, I'll be obliged to both of you," the old man answered with a smile. "It's like tearing out one of MacGregor's arms, but it will have to go. A thing like that is too dan- gerous, even for the Great Dismal Swamp."  The next day, just as the dynamite hoisted all that there was of the Devil's Tree into the air, I heard a hysterical bark behind me. I turned and found the dog. As one of the leatherlike tentacles fell nearby, he seized it in his teeth and shook it viciously, then trotted in and laid it at old Mr. Curtis' feet.  "Pete never liked that tree much," the old man said. "I think his mind is relieved."  "An' so's mine, I'll hae ye knaw-- private-like, ye'll understan'," remarked MacGregor grimly.     A LAUREATE  By Clinton Scollard THERE be many things to sing As pass the vari-colored days-- The birds that mount on gleaming wing, The glamour of the forest ways; The sea that chants unto the shore, The rainbow's radiant arc of light, The earth's abundant harvest store, The red auroras of the night. Yet would I not my lot bewray, But hold it very kind of fate Should Sylvia smile on me and say That I may be her laureate!
