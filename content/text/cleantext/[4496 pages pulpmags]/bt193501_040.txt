BEDTIME TALES 37 Sophie unlatched the casement and let it swing wide. A girl with a blazing bush of the reddest hair that he had ever seen peering out into the dimness of the little balcony. At the sight of Sophie, she said excited- ly: 'Ah--ha, so there you are, ma bebe." "Mais oui!" I am here!" replied Sophie calmly. "What of it?" "Our host, Francois, is beside himself, searching for you from cellar to garret!" continued Sara. "He swears that you promised to dance with him, and the pros- pect seems to have gone to his head with all the wine he has swilled!" She laughed and waved a hand. "Go to him, dearie, and comfort him before he is completely insane!" Sleeky tigerish eyes were focused upon George as Sara rambled on. They were heavy-lidded eyes, glinting feverishly, and egg-white of her complexion. "If monsieur will excuse me--"Sophie was saying. "I did make a promise to Francois that I should keep. Au revoir!" She stepped inside as Sara stepped out on the ledge. "Bon soir, monsieur!" said Sara, smil- ing at George. "Or perhaps I should really say bon matin! Look! The dawn is break- ing." That's right!" said he. "Oh, it is cold, ne c'est pas?" A shiver rippled through her. "Let us go in, mon homme! Would you care to dance with me?" "I was just about to propose the same thing!" he countered with an interested grin. The balcony gave directly on to a nar- row piazza, and beyond it was the draw- ingroom, where several couples were drift- ing about in a pretense of dancing, but paying more heed to each other than to the music. Sophie was there, hugged by Francois.
