All the Music of all the World is at the command of the owner of the Columbia. It is the one perfect, complete musical instrument, the one ideal home entertainer for all the household, for all the year around. Lina Cavalieri the world-famous dramatic soprano, sings exclusively for the Columbia. In her Columbia records the soprano voice is shown at its best. Every note is clear, true and musical, and as reproduced, has exactly the same tonal and dramatic inflection as when rendered originally by the singer in our laboratory. Columbia Double-Disc Records!
