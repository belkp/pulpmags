"My curse upon you, Black George," she cried. The Lost Door By DOROTHY QUICK  An alluring but deadly horror out of past centuries menaced the life of the young American--a fascinating tale of a strange and eery love     I HAVE often wondered whether I would have urged Wrexler to come with me if I had known what Rouge- mont would do to him. I think--looking back--that even if I could have glimpsed the future, I would have acted      in the same way, and that I would have brought him to Rougemont to fulfill his destiny.  As the boat cut its swift way through the waters on its journey to France, I had no thought of this. Nor had Wrexler.   W. T.--3  289
