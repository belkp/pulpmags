With acknowledgments to K. C. B. We'll say Gran'pop packs a wallop! GRAN'POP PROBABLY is. THE NATIONAL champion. AT SWAPPING things. * * * TWO YEARS ago he swapped. THE OLD blind mare. * * * FOR A cider mill. * * * AND THEN of course. WHEN WE went dry. * * * CIDER MILLS got valuable. * * * AND GRAN'POP swapped again. AND GOT a flivver. * * * SO I said, "Gran'pop. * * * SUPPOSE I start you. * * * WITH THAT old busted. BABY CARRIAGE back home. COULDN'T YOU swap it. AND GET me. A LIMOUSINE." A CRAFTY gleam. * * * CAME INTO Gran'pop's eye AS HE said, "No. * * * BUT I'LL tell ye. * * * I'LL SWAP a match. FOR ONE of them. CIGARETTES OF yourn. THAT SATISFY." * * * SO WE swapped. ONE BROKEN paper match. FOR ONE perfect cigarette. AND YOU ought to see. HOW PLEASED he was. IT DID me good. TO BE "done" by Gran'pop. * * * SWAP some change for some Chester- fields. Your good money never brought better value. Choicest tobaccos (Turkish and Domestic) so blended that you get every last bit of their flavor. And Chesterfields do what no other cigarette can do for you --''They Satisfy" Chesterfield Cigarettes They Satisfy Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co.
