128 Detective Story Magazine the October 20th number, see if your solution is correct. Here is the puzzle. Go to it! Following the arrest and conviction of Slim Pete, who committed one of the most daring burglaries in the history of crime, the police of one of our largest cities spent considerable time, and went to great pains, before the loot was recovered. The only clews they had to work on were a note containing a pur- poseless lot of words, and the whispered word, "Hoakersville," which passed from the lips of Pete to a pal as he tried to hand Pete the slip of paper, just as two detectives were leading the dejected prisoner into the station house. The quick ear of one of the detectives caught the word. The note was taken to the handwriting expert at police headquarters, and, when he had spent con- siderable time with it, he discovered that it contained a sentence telling the location of the spot in Hoakersville where the loot was buried. A search was made and the stolen property was recovered. In writing the words, the burglar jumbled them in an unintelligible string, and intended that his pal should work over them until he had them rearranged in a sentence containing correct English. In order to make it a little easier, he built a skeleton of this sentence as it should be, by placing the first word, and each sixth word after it, in its proper place, and made it necessary to rearrange only the other words in his note. This, the handwriting expert tells us, is what he meant by the memorandum in the upper left-hand corner. What can you do with it? 1st and each succeeding 6th. On lighthouse between imaginary running line and cabin, walk on the cliff five from north breakwater, at paces high, turn breakwater to face tide head- light, edge to waters advance, and dig.
