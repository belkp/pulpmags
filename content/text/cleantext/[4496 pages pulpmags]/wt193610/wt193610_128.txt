WEIRD TALES 381    brick-bats? You see, WEIRD TALES suits me just fine. No complaints, just keep up the good work and, to repeat a paean as old as my acquaintance with WT, Keep WEIRD TALES weird."   Again and Again  Charles Donnelly, of Johnson City, Ten- nessee, wrices: "I've always enjoyed WEIRD TALES a lot and I think I have proved it by my consistent reading of it. The tale that I've enjoyed best lately was Child of the Winds by that superb writer Edmond Ham- ilton. It fascinated me so that I read it again and again. Mr. Hamilton's style of writing is one that keeps me fascinated until the end of the story. And that is some praise, because there are so few writers that can do that. I think that this story calls for a sequel because I don't believe Lora will be happy until she is back on the plateau with her friends. . . . I sincerely thank WEIRD TALES for so many enjoyable hours. It takes one out of this humdrum world into a place of dreams. The only fault I ever found with it was when it just printed every other month. I hope that won't happen again, be- cause a month is too long to wait for WEIRD TALES, and two months is eons."   Then and Now  Joseph Allan Ryan, of Cambridge, Mary- land, writes: "Do WT readers ever stop to observe how far WEIRD TALES has traveled since its inception? Let's take an early issue of WT--the October 1925 one, for in- stance--and compare it with the latest one. First of all we have J. U. Giesy's humorous pseudo-scientific tale, The Wicked Flea--a highly illogical story of a flea that grew to a gigantic size and went chasing big dogs all over the country; it relied on silly names and one solitary pun to give it humor(?). Then there was Seabury Quinn's The Horror on the Links, the first de Grandin story. Al- though this tale showed Quinn's superiority in the field of weird story writing, it was not so interesting as are his present de Grandin tales, for it gave a scientific explanation to each phenomenon, whereas tooay we find only indications of the occult in Quinn's masterpieces. The Prophet's Grandchildren, by E. Hoffmann Price, was, though interest- ing, not weird, for it merely retold a legend of the Moslems. . . . The Fading Ghost, by Willis Knapp Jones, started as though it was going to be a real WT short-story clas-      CLASSIFIED ADVERTISEMENTS SMALL ADS WORTH WATCHING   Books ENJOY WILL ROGERS' humorously interesting view- points in--"American Dollars," "European Nobility," "Cowpunchin'." $1 each.
