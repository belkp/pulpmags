"The reception room was blown right out of the house and yet the most careful investigation could not disclose the original cause. It seems cruel to say so, but it would appear that Mr. Kremp's torrid tem- perament, which was long suppressed, suddenly exploded from spontaneous combustion. He used to have a sul- phurous disposition, that gentleman. He was, you might say, an explosive fellow."
