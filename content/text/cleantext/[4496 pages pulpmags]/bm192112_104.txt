The Dark Brown Dress 101 that you kept a room at both the Bray- more and the Buckminster and man- aged to keep up the appearance of living in both of them by means of the stair- way in the roof ? Do you deny that for the past month you have worked your- self to death as Lee Harmon, janitor of the Claridge, in order to be the more certain of success in your little plan ?" I felt a real tinge of pity for the man as he hung his head. Suddenly he looked up. "Perhaps it would help clear mat- ters," he said in a strained, but quiet voice, "if I showed you just exactly what was done in the case, for instance, of the woman." He reached in his hip pocket and drew forth a little box. He removed from it a hypodermic needle. "It was this vein," he said, pointing to his arm with the point of the needle. . . ." We watched him with gaping mouths, half stupefied by the strange tones of his voice. Suddenly Meroe lurched to- ward him, but it was too late. The needle was in his vein and his thumb was pressing home. "I would rather not be bothered with the red tape of a trial," he said quietly. * * * I will not describe in detail the scene which followed. There were screams from the women and somewhat of a panic as they rushed from the room. He did not live more than fifteen minutes. Meroe left the rest in the hands of Larkin and the coroner. We walked home through the park breathing clean air and sunshine to clear our souls of the unwholesomeness with which we had been steeped since morning. "You know," said Meroe, "he would have slipped away with the whole thing right under our noses if he had not described the woman who stared at him as having been dressed in a dark brown dress." And that was the last I ever heard Meroe mention of the affair, for it was his custom to forget these things as soon as his part had been played.
