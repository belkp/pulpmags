NIGHT LIFE TALES 19 queried, rising. For a long moment Eddie found it difficult to reply. "Your name, Monsieur?" she re- peated, a faint smile playing about her voluptuously encarnadined lips. "Edward Quince," Eddie managed. She undulated out of the room, svelt hips swinging. Eddie felt the palms of his hands beginning to mois- ten.

Eddie, possessed of a swell plan for getting into the Bal, almost forgot the pur- pose of his visit. Now, with the Stun- ning femme out of sight, it returned to mind. Everything would depend on whether this high-mucky-muck from Alesia was anywhere near Eddie's size and build. If he happened to be short, fat and roly-poly or tall, gaunt and angular, it would be just too bad. The curtains separating the draw- ing room of the suite from the one adjoining parted and the beautiful brunette returned. "I am sorry, Monsieur," she said, "but His Highness cannot be dis- turbed. He is resting in preparation for zee ball tonight. I am his sister. Can I help?" Eddie licked his lips. He made a mental note to find out where in hell Alesia was. If this beauty was any sample of the feminine Alesians, that was the place for Eddie Quince! "Er--yes, it's about the Bal," Eddie gulped. "I just wanted to ask him about his costume and--well--and get his viewpoint on things in gen- eral. You know, we do that with visiting celebrities."
