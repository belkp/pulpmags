284 WEIRD TALES Dous that the human consciousness, except in rare instances, rejects it. "The conclusion is plain. The unfet- tered Will, by and of itself, can work miracles, move mountains, create and de- stroy! "Listen carefully, for Cou√© and Pavlov and your own J. B. Watson were closer to the truth than they knew. . . . "I pick up tHis coin, and I place it upon my wrist, so. Now I suggest to myself that it is very hot. But my conscious knows that it is not hot, and so I merely appear, to myself and to you all, a trifle foolish. "Nevertheless, any hypnotist can sug- gest to a pre-hypnotized subject that the coin is indeed hot, and the subject's flesh will blister if touCHed with this same cold coin! . . . "Now I will call my servant--" PLACING his two enormous, shapeless hands on the table, Dmitri heaved himself to his feet, and a tremendous bel- low issued from his barrel-like chest. That summons, though the words were lost in a gulf of sound, was unmistakable, and presently the door opened and the little man, prim and neat and wholly a colorless personality, entered. "Yes, Master." Dmitri stood beside the table, his right hand resting heavily on the polished oak. "Sit down, little Stepan." The small man, the ghost of a pleased smile on his peasant face, sat down prim- ly in the oaken chair and looked about the room with child-like pleasure.

Dmitri seemed satisfied. Quietly, sooth- ingly, he spoke. "Can you hear me?" The man's lips moved. "I can hear you." "Who am I?" The answer came slowly, without in- flection. "You are the Voice that Speaks from Beyond the Darkness." Dmitri loomed above the chair. "You remember the truths that I have taught you?" "Master, I remember." "You believe?" "Master, I believe. You have told me that you are infallible." Dmitri straightened triumphantly and surveyed his silent audience. Suddenly, then, a roaring streamer of bluish flame lanced across the room. Dmitri had set the gasoline torch alight. A woman was babbling hysterically. But above the steady moan of the flame Dmitri said loudly, "There is no cause for alarm. Now, observe closely. I am
