They Shall Know  By Harold Cook  I SHALL tell them this morning, The policeman At Forty-second and the Avenue, Who lifts a heavy hand, Like God, Lest men kill each other-- I shall tell him And all the porters In the Grand Central Station. And they will have a new interest In me, those men. No longer will the policeman stay me, But the thousand others, From crossing the Avenue; Nor will the porters see only Three bags and a box And hopes of a quarter When I tell them that last night, By the black water, By the dark blue water, Under a tree that bent over us As trees bend over lovers In the meadows of heaven, Your hands learned my face And your mouth my mouth, And afire with a new knowledge Our eyes shone through the darkness Like four stars. Ah, they will notice me, those men, And touch their caps, And say, "Good morning." And I will answer them As a man should Who has been touched with ecstasy. But I shall not tell the little blonde waitress Who served me my breakfast, For I think she, Wise maiden, Has already suspected.  56
