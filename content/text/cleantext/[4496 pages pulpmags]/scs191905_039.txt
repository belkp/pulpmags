Reflections of a Vampire By June Gibson I GAZE at Paul through lowered lashes and he thinks I tempt . . . and pants. ... If I looked open-eyed upon his freck- led nose and florid neck I would order him from the house. II Harry's wife does not know that there are two kinds of wives: those who manage their husbands and those who pretend they do not. III When I pass my hands lingeringly across Robert's sleek hair, he trembles. He does not know that my jeweled fingers are more pleasing to look upon than the top of his head where it is beginning to grow bald. IV John brings me pearls to match my exquisite beauty. When he comes again I am wearing a clever duplicate of paste. . . . The pearls are edu- cating my grandchildren. V Peter thrills at my anger when he drops a roll of crisp green bills in my lap. It pleases him to think my love for him genuine, not to be bought. ... I am angry because he gives me the bills before my servant to whom I owe three months' wages. VI As I throw myself with abandon in- to Vincent's arms he does not know that his scarf pin is being concealed in the folds of my gown. VII Yesterday Frank's wife pleaded with me.

I catch the odor of corned beef and cabbage escaping from the kitchen. IX There are two kinds of women: those who are not afraid of mice and those who have well-shaped legs. 36
