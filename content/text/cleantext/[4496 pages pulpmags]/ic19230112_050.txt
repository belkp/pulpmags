Of Course! screen comedy, he applied to Dorothy Gish, for a job as "extra." Quite kindly and patiently Miss Gish explained to him that he did not look Italian enough for the part--and all the time, at the back of the room, a friend of Mr. Lloyd's was doubling with laughter, while Harold Lloyd gravely prolonged the scene as long as possible. Another thing you would note at once in Mr. Lloyd, if you talked with him only a few minutes, is his way of chatting easily and pleasantly on almost any subject except himself--New York high buildings and slow traffic; his admiration for Mary Pickford; his conception of the masculine lead in "The Tailor-Made Man," which he thinks should show "the irrepressible spirit to 'carry on,' " that would make itself felt even in the company of people already unfavorably prejudiced and all prepared to be antagonistic. And his conception of this role gives you a good picture of the personality of Mr. Lloyd. He confesses that he likes dancing, and dances a great deal, that his regulation attire consists of patent leather oxfords, navy blue suit, black tie, and white shirt; that the comedies that made him famous were made in two or three days for each picture, one picture following another without interruption. After weeks of this, Harold Lloyd will tell you, they had to rest awhile, because they were oversupplied. It doesn't occur to him that rest was necessary after those strenuous weeks. He bids you good-by with that characteristic smile, head thrown back and a glint of teeth. And you take away the impression that Harold Lloyd is keenly interested in everybody; that he considers each opinion offered, never voicing dissent, but carefully weighing each viewpoint offered him. 47
