THE BEANSTALK 87    THE GIRL (singing) I sang a song-- And they laughed at me, Three hills and a tree, Five birds and a bee, They laughed at me. I sang the song-- Oh--I sang the song.  JACK (jubilantly) "I sang the song"--  (He catches the book firmly under his arm and turns to climb. As he does so, he pauses a moment to run his hand caressingly about the great stalk, suddenly stopping short.)  That was not there before, that rift- ing in the stalk.  (He looks out over the sky.)  Those clouds move swiftly toward the sun.  (From far below the girl's voice comes up to him.)  THE GIRL I sang the song--  JACK What have I to fear now?--"I sang the song"--  (He takes the first step of the leaves with a vault and runs up the stair- way gaily, balancing the book on his shoulder. But the clouds were mov- ing more swiftly than he thought, and a darkness spreads all at once about the vine, and the heavy stalk     trembles in the storm. Sounding still clearly through the darkness come the voices of the boy and the girl.)  JACK (from above) Sing, little girl, sing.  THE GIRL (from below) I am singing--singing all the way.  JACK Only a little while, and then it will be light again.  THE GIRL I can hear you, boy. Down here I can hear you.  JACK And your song comes even here to me.  THE GIRL (at last) I have reached your world, my boy. Where are you now?  JACK (a moment later) Your song gave me a new swiftness --it has brought me, too, to your world.  THE GIRL Only a little while--.  JACK Yes--only a little while, and then we shall come back again. (A great gust of wind drowns their voices, then passes, carrying with it the storm clouds. Again there is light. But the storm has worked its will, and through the very center a great rift cuts in half the beanstalk.)     ALL women have a secret hope that people regard them as just a bit dangerous. A FRIEND is an acquaintance who is on the way to being an enemy.
