AN EXPERIMENT IN GYRO-HATS By Ellis Parker Butler Author of "Pigs is Pigs," etc. "I was able to place tho end of one toe on the point of one picket, and thus balanced, wave the other leg in the air ... When Walsing- ham pulled my hand I inclined gently toward him until I was at right angles to the picket fence, with my foot still on top of the picket; and when he released my hand, I slowly swung upright again."
