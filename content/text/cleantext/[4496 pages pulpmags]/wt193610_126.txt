WEIRD TALES 379   novel. The Hour of the Dragon.--The Editor.]  The Falling Method  Corwin Stickney, Jr., of Belleville, New Jersey, writes: "The July issue is excellent. I rank it second only to the April issue when rating the seven published so far this year. Lost Paradise and Necromancy in Naat are in a virtual tie for this month's honors. Moore is practically unbeatable, while Clark Ashton Smith's work is always of the finest Quality. Since each of these two stories is so different from the other, both in theme and in the style in which it was written, I do not undertake to evaluate one above the other. Let it suffice to say that I enjoyed both hugely, and would appreciate nothing more than a story by each of them in each issue. Ronal Kayser constructed a vivid, stir- ring story in The Unborn. Seldom have I read one more fascinating. Edmond Hamil- ton disappointed me with When the World Slept. It was entirely too obvious; I hadn't read two pages before I had guessed the story's outcome. I cannot at all understand how this yarn can possibly be called weird. It might pass--on a dark night--as science- fiction. But weird fiction--never! The other tales are good, especially Loot of the Vam- pire and The Return of Sarah Purcell. I haven't yet read the new serial or the re- print. . . . Peculiar thing: three of the vic- tims in this month's stories--in The Return of Sarah Purcell, The Unborn, and Kharu Knows All, to be exact--'got theirs' by way of the falling method--either by jumping out a window or by failing down a flight of stairs, as in the case of Emma in The Re- turn of Sarah Purcell. I wonder how many discerning readers will notice that Tim Carewe (in Kharu Knows All) chose Kharu as his new name because it and his real name, Carewe, are phonetically alike."  French Phrases  Gertrude Hemken, of Chicago, contributes the following comments: "Now I'm gonna unload something from my mind that's been rankling me for yars 'n' yars. So often in stories one runs across French phrases, and it is taken for granted the reader knows what they mean, so no explanation is offered. All well and good. However, when one uses a sprinkling of other foreign phrases, unless the author offers translations immediately    LET ME TELL YOU About your business, travel, ganges, matrimony, love affairs, friends, enemies, lucky days and many other interesting and im-portant affairs of your life as in-dicated by astrology.
