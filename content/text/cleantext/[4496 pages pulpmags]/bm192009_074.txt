Daughter of the Pigeon 71 I shall never forget her as she lay there, her exquisite body dashed with the salt spray of the sea, the wound between her breasts as dark as a tropical gar- denia. A half hour later Cleaves and Leap- ing Fire came upon us on the beach. They were about to abandon the search for me, believing me gone to the sharks. After I told them the story we carried Tahaiupehii to the paepae of her father, and here, not far from the bamboo house that had known her love and sorrow, we buried her. . . . between Mahuma and Red Moon. Several hours afterward I was on the deck of the Jczbel, and while a sul- len, red-shot dawn flared above the thunders of Temetiu, the yacht throbbed out of the Bay of Traitors. The last sight that I had of Taoha, the dying isle, was through the morning fog, a haze that lay upon it like a spirit hand . . . as if the volcano that in ages past had spewn it above the green Pacific was reaching up from fathom- less depths to reclaim it. O Tahaiupehii--paepae kaoha!
