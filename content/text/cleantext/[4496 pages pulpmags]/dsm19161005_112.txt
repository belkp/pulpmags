Snarled Identities 109 over seventy-five thousand dollars in gold over to him. "Otherwise, he would have gone scot-free, just as in the case of Simpson. As it is, he'll get something extra for his escape, at least, and I don't believe he'll have a chance to slip away again." "But another case like this would give me heart disease, I'm afraid," he added to himself. THE END. DECADE'S MURDERS AND HOMICIDES THE most "murderous" city in all the world is Memphis, Tennessee, where 63.7 persons out of every one hundred thousand lose their lives by violence, according to statistics for the decade 1904-1913, prepared by the Spectator, an insurance journal, in an article on the "Homicide Record of 1914." Six other Southern cities hold records for "killings," while New York City-- Manhattan and the Bronx--with its enormous population, is a peaceful, law- abiding place, ranking only sixteenth out of the thirty registration cities used. The thirty cities, arranged in the order of "killings," together with the rate per one hundred thousand of population, are: Memphis, 63.7; Charleston, South Carolina, 32.7; Savannah, 28.4; Atlanta, 26; New Orleans, 25.3; Nashville, 24.3; Louisville, 16.6; St. Louis, 12.9; San Francisco, 11.8; Cincinnati, xi; Chicago, 9.3; Seattle, 8.1; Spokane, 7.8; Wash- ington, 7.5; Cleveland, 6.1; Manhattan and the Bronx, New York, 6.1; Dayton, Ohio, 5.5; Pittsburgh, 5.3; Providence, 5.2; Boston, 4.8; Baltimore, 4.6; Brook- lyn, 4.5; Philadelphia, 4.2; Buffalo, 4; Minneapolis, 3.7; Reading, Pennsylvania, 3.5; Rochester, New York, 3.3; Hartford, Connecticut, 3; Newark, New Jer- sey, 3; Milwaukee, 2.4. There were 11,981 homicides in the thirty cities for the decade, or an average of 7.9 per one hundred thousand of population for the whole area. The figures for 1914 show 1,489 murders for the same area, at the rate of 8.6 per one hun- dred thousand population, which, if continued for ten years, would make the total for the decade 14,890. Assuming that the recorded murder death rate for the registration area may be applied safely to the whole country, more than fifty thousand human lives have been deliberately sacrificed. The increase in murder during 1914, as com- pared with the ten years ending 1913 was most marked on the Pacific coast and in the Southern States. The Eastern cities show the murder of 4.9 persons out of every one hundred thousand population for 1904-1913, and 5.1 persons for 1914; the central cities show 8.6, and in 1914, 9.3; while the Southern cities 18.2 for the 1904-1913 decade and 20.4 for the year 1914 and Pacific-coast cities, xo, and an increase to 12.8 for 1914. Among males, 62.8 per cent of the deaths are caused by firearms, and among females 52.2 per cent, while cutting or piercing instruments caused 15.7 per cent, and among females 12.7 per cent of the deaths. The mortality was highest between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-four years. The number of murders in the United States is about one hundred for every thirteen committed in England and Wales, thirty in Australia, thirty-one in Prussia, and fifty-six in Italy.
