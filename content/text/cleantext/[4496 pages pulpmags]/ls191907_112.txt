Sam S. Stinson 107  Mother Goose Up-to-date I OLD KING COLE was a merry old soul, And a merry old soul was he. He called for his pipe and he called for his bowl, And he called for his fiddlers three. But his pipe is clay, and his bowl to-day Is a grape juice brew. Oh, spare us! And his fiddlers three were drowned at sea In a flood of apollinaris. II Dickery, dickery dock! The thirst ran up the block To the place at the corner, Forlorn and forlorner. Dickery, dickery dock! III Little Jack Horner kept at the corner Stuff you could put in a pie. The law put in its thumb and pulled out the rum, With a humor most certainly dry. IV Old Mother Hubbard she went to the cupboard To get her poor dog a bone. When she got there the cupboard was bare, Bone dry in the bone driest zone.  Of Two Evils BEING a coward myself, I am an ardent hero worshiper. The golden chevrons on a soldier's sleeve intoxicate me with adulation. An aviator thrills me with bliss. A man who can nonchalantly go to a dentist commands my admiration. Even a married man inspires my respect. Consequently, when the circus manager volunteered to conduct me through his realms of romance and mystery, my love of heroic deeds prompted me to accept. First he pointed out his celebrities. "There is Signor Scario, my lion tamer," he announced. I regret to say that Signor Scario scarcely looked the part. He seemed decidedly anemic. "Still, you never can tell," I mused. "He must be possessed of great courage." "To-night he has decided to sleep in the cage with his lions," said my host. "Ah! What a brave man," I exclaimed. "Oh, I don't know," replied the circus manager. "He has had a scrap with his wife and he's afraid to go home." Well, it just spoiled my whole day.
