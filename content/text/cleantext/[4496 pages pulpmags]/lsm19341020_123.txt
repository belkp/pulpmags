120 Street &amp; Smith's Love Story Magazine think of, they could afford. Len ex- pressed the thought which was there between them. "Honey," he said, "I'm glad we're rich. But the thing that matters is that we have each other--and love. And all that means. It means everything, Billie. It means happi- ness whether you're rich or poor. And riches mean unhappiness with- out love." "I know," Billie answered softly. "Lots and lots of times I stop and tell myself that all the misery I had before is being made up to me now. Now that I have you, the happiness is supreme. I don't think half so much about the things our treasure will buy, as I think about our life together." His arms stole around her, and he kissed her rapturously. "And we owe it to you," he said huskily. "Because you were brave and clever. I'm glad they caught Holland. I would have been nerv- ous if he had still been at large." For a long time they stood watch- ing the work going on before them. And in their hearts was the beauty of their surroundings, and the won- der of their love. It seemed to Billie as if her misery were far in the past, so great was her happiness now. Len kissed her again and held her close and forgotten was the wealth that was so soon to be theirs. Finally Billie said, almost reverently: "I love you, Len. And my vaca- tion sweetheart is going to be my full-time, all-day, all-through-my- life sweetheart from now on--for always." THE END. MY BEAUTIFUL DREAM Though all my dreams are luring And evermore strangely fair, Like the petals of fragrant roses, That drift on the summer air, Whenever I meet you, darling, As dusk walks the ghostly dew, My tremulous heart discovers My beautiful dream is you. Dear lass, when we keep our trysting And cling by the lilac tree, As you and your yielding kisses Are saying you love but me, The earth is a mystic heaven, Where all of my dreams come true, Because my glad heart is knowing My beautiful dream is you.
