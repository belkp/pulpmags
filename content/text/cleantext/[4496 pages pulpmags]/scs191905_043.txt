40 Limbering Up Ebenezer won't listen to me? If you don't want the skids put under you, you had better harken. I have enough on you to send you to the pen for 400 years. You were too clever for anybody else to check you up, but I have it on you." "What d'you mean?" gasped the Eb- enezer, backed against the wall. "How about the bonds you stole from Widow Wilkes? How about the pho- ney mortgage you foreclosed on Mrs. Smith? How about the perfectly good railway bonds you transferred for worthless oil stock, while trustee for Bascom's boy? How about that deal with old blind Peters? And the other dirty job you did to Old Man Jenkins? Do you want the whole list?" "Enough!" squealed Ebenezer. "Well, how about it? Am I going to wear orchids for breakfast or do you want to swap that alpaca coat for a striped one?" "You win, my dear," said Ebenezer. "Shall I bring it home or bank it for you ?" "I want one of those dinky little checkbooks. Have it upholstered in mauve and plenty of blanks." Bessie left two days later for the big city. Her plan was to enjoy everything there was there, and send home what she didn't have time for at the moment. Everything was working fine and the dollars were chasing each other like automobiles out of Detroit, when one day the Ebenezer got up nerve enough to ask Bessie how she found him out. "Easy," she answered. "You talk fluently and in detail every night in your sleep." If you have no sister, ask a friend.
