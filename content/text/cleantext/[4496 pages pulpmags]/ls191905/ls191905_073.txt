CHASON DE CABARET   By Archibald Sullivan  HE watched her from the table white, Go flashing through the crimson light, On little satined feet so slight.  He saw the dancers row on row, Pass through the maze they called "the show," And rainbows from the "spot" turned low.  At some brief signal or command, She came to him--held out her hand. They swept to meet the swimming band.  "I am so very tired," she said, But faster still the music sped, And globes winked wildly over head.  He thought he held some flying thing, A girl upon a wild bird's wing, A circling ruby that could sing.  Her slender body flew around, Like thistle fluff on windy ground, And Pampas grasses all unbound.  "I am so tired of whirl and rush." Her feet grew still and, oh, the hush. As she was lifted from the crush.  Asked God: "Oh, you, from sound of drum, And noise that makes my stars stand numb. For what small pittance have you come?  "What ease from crashing glass by hours, A paper world with tinsel flowers. Confetti playing rain in showers?"  Then she who danced raised up her head, With stammering weariness and said: "Dear God of Heaven--just a bed."  70
