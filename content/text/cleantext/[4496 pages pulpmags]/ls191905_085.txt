THE JOKE   By Manchester Willdy I HAVE always prided myself upon being able to laugh as heartily as anyone, when the joke is on me. And I have never believed in doing things by halves. So when I found a note lying upon my wife's dressing table I read it.  It was a dulcet bit of foolishness, reeking with love and sentiment, and written by my wife; it was addressed to "My own darling Bill."  Rapidly I named over the "Bills" of our acquaintance, seeking to name the guilty one, for of course I must hunt him out and kill him immediately; also my wife.  There were but three persons who could be suspected, and after inquiring on the phone learned that two of these were out of town, so there was no further doubt left in my mind as to who was the scoundrel.  Not in the least nervous in the face of the terrible thing I was about to do, I searched out one of my hunting knives, put a razor edge on it, and then got into my heaviest motoring coat, for the note had directed "Bill" to meet her at our summer house across the lake.  Even as I let myself into the cottage, and heard my wife coming to meet me. I ran a finger along my knife's edge and waited dispassionately.  As she ran to my arms I drove the blade into her soft flesh up to the hilt! Stupidly she looked up at me.  "Why--Bill," she sobbed, "you've killed me!"  Then I saw the joke and began to laugh. I had entirely forgotten, you see, that my name is "Bill" too.  I have always prided myself upon being able to laugh as heartily as anyone, even when the joke is on me!  82
