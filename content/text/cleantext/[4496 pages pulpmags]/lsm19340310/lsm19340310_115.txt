Little And Lovely By Vivian Grey A SERIAL- Part III. THE STORY SO FAR: Sophia Ambler thought herself in love with Vincent Nelson until he introduces her to Rhoda Kinsella and informs her that Rhoda is the good type of girl he intends to marry. Lonely, Sophia turns to Arnold Cranston, a playboy, for amusement. She also goes out with her publisher boss, Thursby Linden. She is with him one night when they meet Lisbet, society girl who is in love with Linden. Rhoda, out with Cran- ston, becomes mixed up in a murder and goes to Sophia for help. The police, thinking Sophia is the woman in the case, refuse to listen to explanations and take her to the station house where she is forced to spend the night. CHAPTER V. IT seemed to Sophia that a night had never been so long. She wondered what Ar- nold was doing. Had he sobered up? Probably. She knew enough of po- lice methods to know that they probably so- bered him forcibly. Finally faint streaks of light, like the prying fingers of some gaunt skeleton, found their way into her cell. Glad as she was to see the be- ginning of day, she shrank from those horrible, deathlike fingers that seemed to seek her out only to point jeeringly at her. It was an eternity before day dawned fully, an eternity shot with strange noises, harsh voices seeming to talk and to no one in particular. A girl in the cell next to her awakened, stretched, yawned, and then looked across interestedly at Sophia in her transparent pajamas.
