WHOM SHALL I MARRY?  BY PROFESSOR MARCUS MARI SEPTEMBER VIRGO VIRGO rules until September twenty-third. These people are fine scholars, musicians and leaders along educational lines. They are original in speech and their minds are quick and well balanced. Men of this sign should not waste time in subordinate positions as they are capable executives and work best when independent of domination. Freedom is as necessary to them as air. They chafe under restraint, give way to intolerance and impatience, and become thoroughly unhappy and make others equally wretched. Confidence entrusted to the people of this sign is in safe keeping, for nothing under the sun can induce them to betray a trust. They are self-conscious and sensitive in the extreme. Though they have a full share of self-esteem, they are, especially in youth, seized with a shyness which, unless checked by reason and the acquirement of poise, becomes almost a panic. They make fine loyal friends, and in the home are delightful companions, who are very earnest in their desire to contribute to the comfort of their loved ones. In the signs of Leo, Libra and Pisces the people of Virgo will find congenial mates and friends. Professor Mari will give a personal reading to any reader who sends in the coupon.   Name.....Sex.....
