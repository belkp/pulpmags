Excuses We Have Never Heard By Otis C. Little I'M late this morning, sir, simply because I rolled over and took another nap after the alarm went off." "Sorry I wasn't home for dinner last night, dear, but I ran across a couple of old pals of mine and we all went out for a time." "I'd have been on time for this ap- pointment, old man, but I knew you'd be late anyway." "Sorry I can't accommodate you, old chap, but I know you'd never return the ten." "Yes, Your Honor, I was going forty all right, but I was only doing it to try and get away from the speed cop." What Little Girls Were Made For By H. Thompson Rich LITTLE girls were made to hold By horrid savage men and bold. Little eyes were made to see Beauty under savagery. Little lips were made to feast And soothe and calm the savage beast. Little arms were made to press Tighter still the lips' caress. Little breasts were made to lay Savage heads upon and pray. Little girls were made to share Savage triumph and despair. 64
