Phantom Gunman  By John Johnson  There was only one person who could bring law to Sterling County, and they said he was dead. Yet someone, some strange, illusive gunman, entered the ranks of justice to wreak vengeance for the death of an honest man.     "ANY mail for me?" asked the girl.  "Nothin', Miss Lee."  "You're sure there's noth- ing from Jim Cranford?"  The corrupt postmaster of Sterling could not meet Grace Lee's wide vio- let eyes. "Nothin', ma'am," he lied.  She sighed and went away, a shad- ow over her fine-featured, lovely face. The postmaster stuck a postcard in his pocket and hurried over to the Diamond Saloon.  Three men were playing cards at a table. Sterling knew and feared them     as the Big Three. The postmaster handed the postcard to Crease Wal- den, who read,  Dear Grace, Home next week. Love, Jim.  "Jim Cranford's comin' back," said Crease.  At this announcement Capper Munn and Sheriff Sid Lucas started. "Jim Cranford!" they echoed. The three stared at each other, their set faces reflecting the memories roused by that name.   101
