The Girl and the Guitar  By C. Wiles Hallock   Here's ol' Pete Carberry, well known hereabouts as a first-class matchmaker. Although he claims to be top-hand to Cupid, things ain't always as smooth along the path of love as Pete would like to make them.    WHEN I joined up with Jared Arrondale's outfit over in Elko County, I had hopes of fulfillin' a long-cherished dream. As far back as I kin remember, I've nursed a ardent yearnin' to play on the guitar. Waal--young Jerry Arrondale was one of the highfalutinest guitar-twangers ever I heard. Bein' as I was foreman of the Arrondale spread, with Jerry my top-hand, I figgered mebbe my crave to strum the Spanish Fandango and Juan-      iter and other heart-warmin' tunes would be realized.  But I guess Fate didn't decree for me to twang guitar strings, though Jerry seemed willin' enough to give me les- sons when I asked him. We was ridin' over Pardo way one bright May mornin' to see if there was some cattle cars on the railway sidin' there. Jerry'd been playin' and singin' in the bunkhouse the night before and a rip-roarin' time was had by all.  5--Ranch Romances--First Sept. 65
