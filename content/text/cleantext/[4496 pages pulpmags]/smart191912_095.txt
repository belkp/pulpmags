The Reward of Modesty  By James Dallas HER name never appeared in letters more than half an inch high. She alluded to her own ability in the most disparaging fashion and regarded a press agent as the height of bad taste. Her picture never decorated cigar boxes; she preferred to bathe in water rather than in milk; she had a holy horror of divorce. Every night after the play she drove straight home. As a model young woman of excellent character it would have been hard to find her equal. As an actress, she was a dismal failure.    Dusk  By Irmengarde Eberle  THE wind is coming home Old and walking slow Quietly over the houses And quietly through the street, Passing the silent trees And over the broad fields. The wind is coming home The old familiar way. Tenderly touching the earth And kissing the sleep-drug'd bay, And wondering how he ever went So heartlessly away. The wind is coming home. Still he has far to go. He has been out to the ends of the earth And now he wonders why. The wind is getting old And he has the heart to die.  88
