106 The Last Job McAlister--marry a woman that mil- lions of men would be proud and glad and lucky to have love them. There, that's my talk--and that's the last word I'm saying. You've got blamed little time to decide before I start trying to take you back. Miss McAlister, go right to it. Say what?" Kitty did not answer him. Instead, she looked at Jim Knowles--looked at him with wild hope as she once more placed herself entirely in his hands. He met her eyes squarely, though his cheeks were flushed and his embarrass- ment showed. But it was he, who re- plied to honest Terry Neall: "Neall," he said, putting out his hand, his face literally crimson now, "if you'll take my hand, man to man, you'll know that I mean it when I say I give my word never to crack another safe and to marry the finest woman in the world!" The detective didn't waste a frac- tion of a second in gripping the offered hand; also, neither did he waste a frac- tion of a second in turning his back as Kitty rushed for Jim with a glad, joy- ous cry that meant the dreams of years had come true! A War Memory By Frederick Moxon WHEN I was over there in France Driving an army ambulance, I sang a song and took my chance. I took my chance and sang a song, For war is foul, but youth is strong, And life is sweet, and death is long. Yes, life and love alike are sweet, And by the well we used to meet,-- Myself, and pretty Marguerite. In southern vale the village lay,-- ("Hell's Road" a thousand worlds away), And there was rest and holiday. A church there was with chiming bell, And moonlight silence by the well Where whispering poplar-shadows fell. I tried my French each little while, And Marguerite, with puzzled smile, Our meanings tried to reconcile. But Love be praised! and thank the Fates! One thing for no translation waits: Her kisses "talked United States."
