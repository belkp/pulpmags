ADVERTISING No More Wrinkles BEAUTIFUL FIGURE Superfluous Hair Vanishes Like Magic. Eyelashes Beautified Pimples and Blackheads Removed Forever Let this woman send you free, everything she agrees, and beautify your face and form quickly. This clever woman has not a wrinkle upon her face; she has per- fected a marvelous, simple method which brought a wonderful change in her face in a single night. For removing wrinkles and develop-ing the figure, her method is truly wonderfully rapid. She made herself the woman she is today and brought about the wonderful change in her appearance in a secret and pleasant manner. Her complexion is as clear and fair as that of a child. She turned her scrawny figure into a beautiful and well-developed form. She had thin, scrawny eye-lashes and eyebrows, which could scarcely be seen, and she made them long, thick and beautiful by her own methods and re- moved every blackhead and pimple from her face in a single night. Nothing is taken into the stomach, no common massage, no harm-ful plasters, no worthless creams. By her new process, she removes wrinkles and develops the whole figure plump and fat. It is simply astonishing the hundreds of women who write in re-garding the wonderful results from this new beauty treatment, which is beautifying their face and form after beauty doctors and other methods failed. She has thousands of letters on file like the following: Mrs. M. L. B. Albin, Miss., writes: "I have used your beauty treatment with wonderful success. I have not a wrinkle on my face now and it is also improving my complexion, which has al-ways troubled me with pimples and blackheads. My weight was 112 pounds before taking your treatment and now I weigh 117, a gain of 5 pounds. Your treatment is a God send to all thin women. I am so grateful you may even use my letter if you wish." The valuable new beauty book which Madame Clare is sending free to thousands of women is certainly a blessing to women.
