68 "Till Death Us Do Part" May: I'm going to marry Jim Raxter! Hamilton: You're going to marry me; I love you, May! May: Is that why you ran away and left me? Hamilton: I couldn't forget you. I thought of you by day and I dreamed of you by night. When I heard you were going to marry Jim Raxter, I knew you could never be anybody's wife but mine! I've come back for you! May: Hit's too late! Hamilton : You don't love Jim! May: Jim's waiting on me at the foot of the falls with the preacher and half the county! Hamilton : You belong to me! (He nears her, but stops as the girl speaks with sudden fury.) May : Why don't you marry Porter Creas- man's girl? Hamilton : Why should I marry her? May: They say you're to blame for her shame! Hamilton : That's an evil lie! I never went with the Creasman girl--I never cared for her! May : I knew it was a lie-- Oh, I knew it! Hamilton: Look here, May, what did you prom- ise to marry Jim for? May : Jim asked me to marry him, and--! Hamilton : You mean--? May: I'm not looking for shame like the Creasman girl's! Hamilton : May! (He takes Iter in his arms. May sur- renders herself to the love she feels for him. She clings to him, sobbing.) May: What'll we do? What'll we do? Jim'll never give me up! How can I face Granny and all the people? Hamilton : Why face them at all? We'll run away. I'll slip around by the upper trail and wait for you at the top of the falls. When Granny takes you down to the folks tell her you've got to go back to the house for something you forgot--and meet me at the head of the upper trail. I've got a horse and buggy at the fork of the roads. By the time Granny and the folks wake up to the fact that you've cut and run we'll be on the down train at Penrose! May: Yes, yes, that's best! Hamilton : I'll take your suit-case. May: No, they might see you! I'll take hit. Hamilton : Put this in it--in case anything goes wrong you can follow me to Penrose. Tickets for Greenville.
