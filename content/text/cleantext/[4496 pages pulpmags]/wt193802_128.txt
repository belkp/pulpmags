WEIRD TALES 253 as all tales of Atlantis interest me. However, sir--permit me to correct you. On page 712 when David is accosted by the two Euro- peans, the German Leutnant should have asked 'Woher kommen Sie?' not 'Woher kommst du?' In speaking to a stranger, a German will always use the polite form 'Sie' unless that stranger be a child or one be- neath the speaker. Ah!--a cat tale (no puns) Kara Kédi was a tense enough story --but the ending was somehow dull. How- ever, I did like the author's description of Kara Kédi--its long legs and lithe body. I'm sure I would like him--just as I like all cats. HPL's short fantasies are so dream-like --rather sweet--rather puzzling. Polaris is a fine little one--much to my taste. Looking through comments from Eyrieites, I see where Pete Thompson of Seattle voices prac- tically the same thots I do re Mr. Pryke's letter par excellence. I find mutual senti- ments with G. W. Skora of Tucson--who is carried away into living the story--even as do I." Finlay's Verse-illustrations Manly Wade Wellman writes from New York City: "Let me get my two cents' worth over, in favor of Virgil Finlay's full-page verse-illustrations. This painstaking young artist is one of your notable discoveries. My limited art education gives me some appre- ciation of the time and trouble he must con- sume in doing that stippling and cross- hatching, and he has withal a mighty feeling for the macabre. Maybe I'm prejudiced to- ward the short-short form, but I pick Wan- drei's Uneasy Lie the Drowned as the finest in the December issue. Incidentally, I am gratified at numerous appreciations in the Eyrie of my own efforts to be horrible in small compass." Competition Arthur L. Widner, Jr., writes from Bry- antville, Massachusetts: "They say competi- tion is the life of trade and it seems to be true also in the case of artists. The picture of the Donna Marchesi on the October cover is the best Brundage cover I have yet seen. In fact, I would say it was the best weird cover I have yet seen by anybody. I can just imagine Mrs. Brundage wielding a wicked crayon, and muttering to herself, 'So that young whippersnapper, Virgil Finlay, thinks he can show me up!
