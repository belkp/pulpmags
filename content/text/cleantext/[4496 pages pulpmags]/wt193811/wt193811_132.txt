NAME ADDRESS TOWN STATE   RIPLEY'S EXPLANATION: 26 Mile Knee Crawl Over Untreated Concrete! The world's longest foot-race is the Olympic Marathon- 26 miles, 385 yards. Tom Boyd went the distance on his knees, over untreated con- crete, wearing unprotected Lee Jelt Denim Overalls, every step supervised by a Certified Public Account- ant. He had to quit once, because the skin on his knees wore out! The "C. P. A." sent me the certified report and the Lee Overalls. The denim looks as if it had miles of grueling wear left in it. The strong multiple-twist yarn puts amazing strength in this genuine Jelt Denim for the toughest job. 166,344 Trampling Feet --A strip of Jelt Denim, the identical special denim used in Lee Overalls, was pat down in the entrance of a towering skyscraper. 83,172 people walked across it taking an average of 3 steps each on the Jelt Denim! 249,516 steps alto- gether! The Jelt Denim, while showing some wear, didn't have a hole or a break, still held its blue color! Here's amazing proof of Lee Overalls extra wear for your money--Believe It Or Not! Copr. 1938 THE H.
