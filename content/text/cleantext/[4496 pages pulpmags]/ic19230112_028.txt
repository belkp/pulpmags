Uncle Oscar's House Party 25 before the mirror, curling my hair with the irons Norma Rose had lent me and experimenting with her cosmetics. When I finished I was exquisite-- far more lovely than any of the other girls, so I thought. But I was restless and decided to ex- plore the house.

Then suddenly a drowsiness crept over me, from the dimness and the silence, and lay down on one of the great white skins before the fire. A moment more and I slept. . . .

In one corner a fire crackled merrily and on the hardwood floor were three great white bearskins with mounted, snarling heads. The shades were drawn, the room almost dark. And so quiet and peaceful it was, as though people had long ago forgotten to enter it. There were heavy rafters in the ceiling, and a balcony encircling the entire room. And in one corner stood a baby grand. "It's only me," he said. "Your skat- ing partner." "Oh! You frightened me!" "I've been watching you for a long time," he continued, "from the bal- cony.
