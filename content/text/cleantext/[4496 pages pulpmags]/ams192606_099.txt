Peyton Wertenbaker (Concluded) one accord they rose before my eyes and, ignoring me as a baser creature, they stripped away their load of tat- tered rags and, one by one, they stalk- ed with their tiny shrivelled limbs into the shivering gale of swirling, gusting snow, and disappeared. And I was alone. . . . So am I alone now. I have written this last fantastic history of myself and of Mankind upon a substance that will, I know, outlast even the snow and the Ice--as it has outlasted Man- kind that made it. It is the only thing with which I have never parted. For - is it not irony that I should be the historian of this race--I, a savage, an "archaic survival ?" Why do I write? God knows, but some instinct prompts me, although there will never be men to read. I have been sitting here, waiting, and I have thought often of Sir John and Alice, whom I loved. Can it be that I am feeling again, after all these ages, some tiny portion of that emotion, that great passion I once knew? I see her face before me, the face I have lost from my thoughts for eons, and something is in it that stirs my blood again. Her eyes are half-closed and deep, her lips are parted as though I could crush them with an infinity of wonder and dis- covery. O God! It is love again, love that I thought was lost! They have often smiled upon me when I spoke of God, and muttered about my foolish, primitive superstitions. But they are gone and I am left who believe in God, and surely there is purpose in it. I am cold, I have written. Ah, I am frozen. My breath freezes as it mingles with the air, and I can hardly move my numbed-fingers. The Ice is closing over me, and I cannot break it any longer. The storm cries wierdly all about me in the twilight, and I know this is the end. The end of the world. And I--I, the last man. . . . The last man.... ... I am cold--cold. . . . But is it you, Alice, Is it you? THE END OPPORTUNITY AD-LETS This column will appear monthly in AMAZING STORIES. Follow it regularly and receive news of attractive offers from reliable advertisers.
