256 WEIRD TALES of the Neutralia by B. Wallis is also a very interesting and, perhaps, prophetic novel. Let's have more yarns of the space-rovers. During the year 1937 you have given us several outstanding stories. After carefully checking over the last twelve issues, I find ten which rank among the best of all time; The Globe of Memories by Seabury Quinn, The Guardian of the Book by Henry Hasse, The Lass Archer by Earl Peirce, Jr., The Headless Miller of Kobold's Keep by G. Garnet, The Haunter of the Dark by H. P. Lovecraft, The Black Kiss by Robert Bloch and Henry Kuttner, The List Pharaoh by Thomas P. Kelley, The Like of Life by Ed- mond Hamilton, Quest of the Starstone by C. L. Moore and Henry Kuttner, and The Sea-Witch by Nictzin Dyalhis." December Issue a Pip! Clifton Hall writes from Los Angeles: "Wow! Weird Tales doesn't believe in do- ing things half-way, does it? What have they done now but top off their greatest year with the best number I recall having ever read! Yes, that December issue was a pip! There were so many good yarns that it is difficult to select the best three. How- ever, after some deliberation, I'd say that The Sea-Witch slips in with first honors. Let's have some more from Nictzin Dyalhis, who has been strangely silent the past year or so. Lovecraft's short jewel, Polaris, comes next in spite of its brevity. That one be- longs with the weird classics. For third I'd say Hamilton's Child of Atlantis, although Pane of the Black Pharaoh and The Black Stone Statue are close behind. Even if this were all, the December WT would be the best in many moons. But there are also Uneasy Lie the Drowned, and Laocoon, plus a pretty good one in Flames of Vengeance! The cover was catchy, and Virgil Finlay's illusrarion of the vampire was a swell new feature. And now I have a suggestion to make. Why not have all WT fans vote once a year to select the best story of the past twelve months, just as one of the movie magazines selects the best film of each year? You could use one page as a sort of plaque, with the winners listed, year by year. I sin- cerely hope that you will print this sug[-] gestion, as I believe that many readers wil[l] agree with me. I think I'd select Quinn'[s] The Globe of Memories as 1937's best, wit[h] Fessenden's Words second and The Thin[g] on the Doorstep third. Why not see wh[at] the other WT-fanciers think?" Concise Comments Charles H. Chandler writes from Wooste[r,] Ohio: "The Lake of Life is swell--the mo[re] Hamilton the better. Who was the fello[w] in an earlier story in WT--a couple of yea[rs] back--a man with a steel hand--interpl[an-] etary adventurer? If any more stories abo[ut] him, or by the same author, are available, le[t's] have 'em! The Brundage covers are anoth[er] distinctive feature of WT--they're good." Donald A. Wollheim writes from N[ew] York City: "The full-page pictures by Fi[n-] lay represent one of the best ideas ev[er.] They should give him ample room to po[r-] tray some of the weirdest drawings that a[n] artist may hope to draw. But why not ha[ve] a number of copies of each run off on qua[l-] ity slick paper for separate sale? Th[ey] should make fine pictures for adorning t[he] den of a weirdist." Robert J. Hoyer writes from Chicag[o:] "The Sea-Witch was a grand tale. I dunn[o,] there's something about that fellow Dyalh[is] stories that gets me. I've been a fan of h[is] since The Sapphire Goddess." Andrew J. Wolsey writes from Londo[n] "May I take this opportunity of congrat[u-] lating you on your success in printing, to [my] mind, the most thrilling serial ever writte[n] namely, The Last Pharaoh?" Most Popular Story Readers, let us know which story you li[ked] best in this issue of Weird Tales, and w[hy.] Your criticism of the stories we print w[ill] help us to keep the magazine as you des[ire] it. In the December issue, that strange t[ale] by Nictzin Dyalhis, The Sea-Witch, is [far] out in front in popularity, as shown by y[our] votes and letters.
