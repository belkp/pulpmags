This number of The Smart Set, owing to the printers' strike, has been published under great difficulties. We ask our readers' indulgence in the matter of the magazines appearance, particularly the paper.   Vol.LX DECEMBER, 1919 No.4 The SMART SET Edited by George Jean Nathan and H.L Mencken     Christian, Pagan and Iconoclast  By Gorham B. Munson    I  A FLY was enmeshed in a huge spider-web. It closed its eyes, breathed as little as possible, and gave itself up to hopes of a miracu- lous escape, a blissful contemplation of an unmarred sugar-bowl carnival, and the picture of a great bonfire of black spiders. After a while the silent spider ran out and devoured the fly.  II  Another fly was enmeshed in the same huge web. It gazed with wonder at the random shafts of sunlight which fell in its dark corner, it admired the     delicate strength of the circling web, it inhaled with joy the scented air of the hay-loft, it listened intently to the occasional harmonies bandied about by the wind. After a while the silent spider ran out and devoured the fly.  III  Still another fly was enmeshed in the huge web. It thrashed its wings, it wrenched its body, it kicked its legs. The web yielded here and there and shook tremulously at the utmost exer- tions of the victim. After a while' the silent spider ran out and devoured the fly.   S.S.- Dec. 1
