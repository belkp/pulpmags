Uncle Oscar's House Party 27 I stumbled to my feet and climbed upstairs to my room. "Anna-Lee," Uncle Oscar called. "I say, don't take it that way--why, it's only a joke, you know." BUT I did not answer, and slammed the door to. I began to pack, sob- bing all the while. I was so ashamed! And my foolishness had lost me Jack forever. A few minutes later there was a knock on the door. "Who's there?" I asked crossly. "It's Jack Weston," came the an- swer, "Won't you let me speak to you just a moment?" I opened the door a little way. "What is it?" I asked. "I came to say that I'm sorry," he said. "You see, I didn't know you had never had anything to drink before. If I had known, I wouldn't have let you take any." There was a silence. "Do you mind if I ask why you did take those highballs?" he asked finally. I hung my head, and stammered out the truth. "Because I liked you, and wanted to attract you. Sarah Hunting- ton and the others all drink and vamp, and I thought that it was the thing to do." Jack Weston whistled. "You were all wrong," he told me. "I was aw- fully keen about you after we got ac- quainted on the pond this morning. The others were amusing, but you were a pal. You were healthy and-- You aren't really going home, are you?" "I've got to," I answered. "I could never face the others again." "Oh, don't be silly! They under- stand and--well, I did hope we could slip away and go skating this evening. There's a full moon and it will be won- derful. Won't you stay? . . . Please!" I hesitated. Then I thought of Sarah Huntington. How happy she would be if I went home and left Jack all to her. "I'll stay," I murmured, blushing slightly. And then very softly I closed the door.
