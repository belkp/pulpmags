The Price of a Flop-House Bunk Told by a Down-and-Out "Eagerly a newspaper is caught up and padded under the coat" When you see a shabby human wreck shuffle past on a bitter night, don't you wonder what brought him to want? This is the story one poor wretch tells. DO you know what a "flop joint" is? Was there ever a time in your life you walked the midnight streets endlessly, jingling the few coins in your pocket, debating whether to buy a bed for the night or hold the money for that much-desired breakfast in the morning? Did you ever watch the stars slowly fade behind a murky wall of banking clouds while the chill wind shrieks through the deserted streets, as the first snowflakes drift down--advance warn- ing of the white pall that will soon cover the city? To think of a bench in the park is sheer nonsense. Lynx-eyed policemen prevent any doorway comfort. Saloons are a thing of the past, and the all-night pool rooms and eating houses don't want you unless you can pay. . . . The flakes come in feathery puffs now. The wind from across the court house park whistles through the bare trees and penetrates the thin clothes you wear. Bed or breakfast--the three nickels in your pocket will pay for one or the other. A crumpled newspaper hurtles across the pavement. That means a whole lot to-night. Eagerly it is caught up and padded under the ragged coat to help keep warm. The flakes are thick now. Then a harder blast brings a hail of sleet and frozen drops pelt the face like bullets. 48
