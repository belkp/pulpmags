"Nothing can hurt me now, sweetheart. And there's nothing for us to fear. I came up here to give my enemies a chance at me; I wanted to trap the man responsible for the political- graft racket. I knew he'd try to frame me as he framed Dave. But the girl they picked to do the trick this time was one of my own assist- ants.

We've enough evidence on Lathrop Trueman to put him behind bar for twenty years." "And Sam?" "The evidence proves him a blind dupe, not a crook. But he's defi- nitely out of politics." She relaxed against him, blissfully content. His arms tightened about her; his lips found her own waiting ones. "We must find Les and tell him you're safe," he murmered making no move to do anything of the kind.

When, full of awe, A new moon I saw, I hummed a tune- "Love is a new moon." I heard a bird sing, Just a simple thing, But my heart it fed; "Love's a song. I said." Love is a cloud, a Moon; love is a song- Come, let us find it now, Come, come along! Elfrida Norden.
