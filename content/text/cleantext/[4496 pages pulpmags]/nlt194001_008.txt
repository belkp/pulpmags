NIGHT LIFE TALES 5 one of these days and you'll find your- self in prison . . . you and your father and Pietro. Just because all the gyp- sies pick pockets you don't have to. Promise me that you'll cut it out, Salvatia.' And then, without giving her a chance to answer he had practically pushed her out of his tent, had said, "Run along to bed now, Salvatia. Like a good little girl!" Because she was too furious to trust words in her mouth she had flung herself into a dance . . . wildly, . . . her hips swaying, her whole body swaying rhythmically with her agi- tated steps. Pietro had thrown aside his accordion. He had come to her through the moonlight. "You are my woman," he had said, huskily. "I did not know it before." He had slipped his neck beads about her throat, had kissed them in place in gypsy bethrothal fashion and had crushed her in his arms. The next morning Sammy left and as if to prove to herself how much she hated him, Salvatia moved through the circus crowd and picked every pocket she saw. She had been picking pockets all the four years of Sammy's absence, getting satisfaction out of her nimble fingers and her defiance of his advice. She hadn't been caught nor would she be, even though her father and her mother had been and were in jail in Paris now. Pietro had just missed being caught. But Pietro was too slick . . . slick with his own cunning technique.
