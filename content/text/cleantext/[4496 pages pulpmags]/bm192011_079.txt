76 The Half-Asleep Girl Fleming Knibbs and Lola were bliss- fully unaware. Then Dreer's green spectacles poked their way through the door. Fleming had his half-asleep girl in his arms-- no longer half asleep, however, for her lips were pressed to his in passionate surrender. The little man said later he never saw, and never expected to see again, so beautiful, so colorful a pic- ture. He coughed. "Come in," said Knibbs, without looking up. "It's Hjalmar Yensen below," ex- plained Simeon. "He says 'Red' Bel- den and the man called Jim confessed to making off with your personal prop- erty and named the 'fence' they had employed. He has recovered every- thing, young Knibbs, and wants to see you." "Can't," replied Fleming, briefly, giving the chair a hitch so that its back was now to the door. "I'm busy. Tell him to leave the Ingersoll and scarf pin in your care. As for the wallet--let him keep it." "And its contents?" "Of course." "Whew!" "And Dreer--" "Yes?" "Invite him to the wedding. We can have him watch the gifts, you know."
