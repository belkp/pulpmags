WEIRD TALES 279 The Poets By Robert E. Howard Out of the somber night the poets come,A moment brief to fan their lambent flame;Then, like the dimming whisper of a drum,Fade back into the night from whence they came. The gray fog, swirling cloak of cynic Time,Meshes achievement in the ages' glomb,A moment's mirth, a breath of lilting rime,And then--the gray of old oblivion's womb. Weaver of melodies all golden-spunThe singer sings his song--and passes on.The poet strums his lyre--then is oneWith gray-hued dusk and rose of fading dawn. A moment's laughter on the winds of Time,A moment's ripple on Time's silent sea,A golden riffle in the river's slime,And then--the silence of Eternity. Gray dust and ash where leaped the mystic fire,Mingled with air and wind the once-red flame; Breeze-borne the tune, but now forgot the lyre--Remains?--the musty thing that men call Fame. Half-curious eyes that scan the yellowed page,All heedless of the makers of the feast--Why, Pierrot might have been a musty sage,Fran√ßois Villon a stoled and sour priest. Who penned this lyric? Who this sonnet? WhenceThe soul on fire that snared these stars in song?Who knows? Who cares? A vast indifferenceIs all the answer of the marching throng.
