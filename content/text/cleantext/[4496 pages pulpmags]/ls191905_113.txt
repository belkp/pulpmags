AN ASSYRIAN GARDEN By Brian Padraic O'Seasnain  PRINCESS AJAVIDA:  "ONE hour in that far long ago, The Emperor came to my door Flying his enemies by night. I hid him, for his wounds were sore.  "I hid him in my little house. Outside the roses blossomed slow; In their sweet sheltering he forgot Empire and friend and foe.  "One sun-gold hour, within the heart Of my warm, high-walled garden, we Spoke, lowly-voiced, of little things-- Of life that sang in field and tree,  "Of life--and something more--our eyes Met, and my heart spoke suddenly. Ah, there within my garden walls, Heaven had come to me!  "They found him when the roses fell. Their foam-sprayed, driven horses came Down through the garden. A red yell Burst like a sudden flame!  "He kissed me once and softly said: â€˜Beloved, what a little thing Is death!' and turned with lifted head. They slew him, marvelling.  "The red blades spilled his life, but I Found a last drop within the bowl. I held him in my arms to die; And his unstricken soul  "Found breath to say one word. I bent, He called my name with a last cry. The watching soldiers rose and went. There is no bride more proud than I!"  110
