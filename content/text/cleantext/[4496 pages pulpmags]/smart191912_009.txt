Telegrams  By Agnes Miller    I HAVE a friend who is a telegraph operator.  Once I asked him what most tele- grams were about.  "All telegrams," he replied, "are about one of two subjects: money or kisses."  "The second," I suggested, "no doubt always acknowledge the first?"  "Never. They serve either as a re-     quest for the first or as a reply to the request."  "And the first?"  "That may be either an acknowledg- ment of or a request for the second."  "And do both," I inquired, 'ever ap- pear together in one telegram?"  My friend, the operator, smiled.  "Only," he answered, "in messages sent by the poor."      Witch-Fire  By George Sterling SAID the faun to the will-o'-the-wisp: "You are fugitive, far!" Said the will-o'-the-wisp to the faun: "But more near than the star." Said the faun to the will-o'-the-wisp: "You are white, you are cold!" Said the will-o'-the-wisp to the faun: "I am fire to the bold." Said the faun to the will-o'-the-wisp: "You are fey, you are fair!" Said the will-o'-the-wisp to the faun: "If I be, have a care!" It was far on the marsh that she fled; It was far from the dawn. Now the winds of the morning have found Not her light nor the faun.  2
