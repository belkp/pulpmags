Ananias Ltd. 29 "How do you feel, Cryder?" I asked. "You know my name?" he asked. "Who are you?" "Guernsey's my name," I said. "United States Post Office In- spector." "What are you doing way up here?" "I've been following you for a month or so." Cryder sighed and closed his eyes again. "Oh, hell," he said, finally. "All that fuss. I'll pay out all right. There's two hundred thousand in the bank. I'm not broke. I made a for- tune in that stock deal and told every- body I was broke. Please let me go on with it. I must get back with these pictures of the mine and drive old Jedidiah out of his club again. It'll only cost me about twenty thou- sand more and it's well worth it. I've spent so much time on it and it's such a grand yarn." I shook him by the shoulder. "But it's not like you to deceive people in this manner," I shouted in his ear. "Don't you worry about that," he answered. "Jedidiah is only waiting to steal the pennies off Uncle Zeke's eyes. I just wanted to get that old double-crosser so good he wouldn't dare hold his head up. I wanted to show everybody who was the better business man--me or him. I guess I've done it. I've done some- thing nobody ever did before. I've sold stock in a mine that never ex- isted, paid dividends on it, made them want to emigrate out here, and now I've provided them with a spot to emigrate to. The big joke will come when Jedidiah gets out here and tries to find the gold." I thought he had fainted in earnest, when his voice trailed off in a whisper at the close. But he rallied again and opened his eyes with a faint but whimsical smile. "Cryder," I shouted. "There is gold in the Hectopus. McGuire has found a pocket that is worth a quarter of a million dollars if it is worth a cent. Do you hear me?" The smile on his face broadened, then was replaced by a frown. "Hell," he muttered. "All that time wasted. And it was such a perfectly beautiful lie."
