74 The Failure shots, he came lumbering along signal- ling for his mate. . . . He dodged into the shadow and turned into the alley. Behind him he could hear the policeman hammering on the office door with his night stick. From two blocks down street came the sound of another whistle. In the dis- tance a third shrilled, proving that re- inforcements were on the way. Mrs. Duncan was sleeping soundly when he arrived home after a round- about trip through alleys and side streets. Letting himself into the house with his pass key, he hastily sought the security of his own room. So far as he knew no one had seen him either going to the factory nor leav- ing it. But, God! What a fizzle he had made of the affair. And there was blood on his hands--the blood of poor old Judkins. What had he gained? Nothing --absolutely nothing. He paced the floor, every nerve tin- gling. He wondered. . . . Poor old Judkins. . . . And he had a crippled wife, too. . . . With Judkins gone she would have to go to the poorhouse. . . . It was something that he had not fore- seen. He was still pacing the floor when the sun came up in the east. In the other room he heard Mrs. Duncan getting up. In less than two hours he would have to go to the office. Of course no one would suspect him, but-- He could hear Mrs. Duncan rattling the pots and pans in the kitchen when the door bell rang. He opened the bed- room door a crack and peeped through as she answered the summons. A gruff voice was asking for him. He heard her admit the visitors--there seemed to be two of them--then she called shrilly up the stairway for him. He knew that they were detectives from their heavy tread. They were after him for killing Judkins. His brain was in a whirl. Yet he wondered how it happened that they associated him with the crime. He had been so care- ful, too. Probably he had dropped something in his mad rush to the outer door. He could never face the music. . . . And Mrs. Duncan! What would she say? He couldn't tell her that he had gone to the office to rob the vault for her sake and had made a failure. . . . The gun lay in the bureau drawer where he had tossed it. He picked it up and broke it open. The chambers were all empty. He had used every cartridge in killing poor old Judkins. . . . From downstairs came a buzz of con- versation. Mrs. Duncan shrieked. . . . He heard his own name mentioned. . . . God! They had told her what he had done! . . . He must move rapidly. His glance fell upon a bottle of car- bolic acid. . . . Mrs. Duncan was at the bottom of the stairway now, shrieking his name. . . . He placed the bottle to his mouth and emptied it at a gulp! . . . With the fiery liquid eating into his vitals--his throat afire--he reeled across the room and tumbled in a heap upon the bed. . . . Outside, Mrs. Duncan was pounding at his door. "Amos! Wake up!" she was shout- ing between sobs--for Mrs. Duncan was a hysterical woman--"an awful thing's happened. There are two de- tectives here. Old man Judkins went home sick from the factory last night and while he was gone somebody broke into the office! The robbers had a fight 'cause one of them was found dead when the police broke in after hearing the shots! "Enright, the cashier, is out of town and they want you to come down and open the vault and see if anything is gone. Oh, isn't it awful? "Amos, why don't you answer?"
