WEIRD TALES 379 Finlay's full page is much more to my taste this time. The spires and skyline look so other worldish. Well, guess I'll wait for another installment of The Hairy Ones Shall Dance before I comment--somehow that Devil's Croft is enticing. Raggh--woof-- grrr--I like so very much this Toean Mat- jan, but I cannot pronounce such words sat- isfactorily. And so I am riled, in spite of a cat tale--and such a pretty white cat! I have often wondered if a tiger would make a good pet. And so the verr√ºchter Austrian is now a block of ice in the black vastnesses of the void--and thus ends his The Voyage of the Neutralia. I found the closing install- ment rather flat, except for the Venusian centipedes and volcano. Doctor Keller turned out a nice one with his Valley of Bones-- such, I believe, is entirely possible in this strange land of Africa. I was pleased to see your reprint of Ethan Brand--I have read it so many times along with others of Haw- thorne's tales." Both Lusty and Devout Manly Wade Wellman writes from New York City: "Let me vote for Quinn's Roads as the most impressive thing in the January WT. It gives me to think thus: does not the world of fantasy hold its good powers as well as evil, its saints and angels as well as its fiends and devils? Roads was both lusty and devout, as a good Christmas tale should be." Finlay Frontispiece Robert A. Madle writes from Philadel- phia: "Thanks exceedingly for inaugurating the new frontispiece department. Both pic- turizations which have appeared have been supreme. Virgil Finlay is unquestionably the modern master of weird art, as H. P. Love- craft was the unquestioned master of weird fiction. Continue this department, and have Finlay illustrate the entire interior of the magazine hereafter. His covers are also superb, but do not neglect Brundage entire- ly. She is one of the best artists of the decade." Reprints N. J.
