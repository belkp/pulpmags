Trail's End HERE it is the First September Issue, the New Deal working strong, and everything all hunky-dory. Let's take a deep breath of the good old sage-scented air of the West into our lungs, and face life with a new vigor and new hope. Let Ranch Romances and the Trail's End Club bring a message of courage to your hearts. And in order that the hand of friendship may be extended beyond new horizons, let's all make an effort to secure new mem-bers for our friendly Club. Incidentally, we shall be publishing the names of active mem-bers again soon. So if you want to see your name on the list, write us and let us know your correct name and address, and tell us you wish to be included in the active-member file.
