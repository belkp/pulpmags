  WEIRD TALES 125    stupid Trowbridge. In the May issue Thunder in the Dawn, Pigeons from Hell and The Secret of the Vault, in the order named, pleased yours truly best. Honorable mention goes to the poem, Where Once Poe Walked. In closing I will say that anyone who derides Poe and his work is not and cannot possibly be a lover of weird tales as exemplified by Lovecraft, C. A. Smith, Kuttner and others in our own Unique Magazine."   The Easter Island Images  John H. Green writes from Washington, D. C.: "No use to tell you how much I enjoy WT, because if I didn't I wouldn't read it and keep on reading it. Roads by Seabury Quinn was about the only story I ever read three times and probably will read it again. . . . Current novel by Jack Wil- liamson is great. The Eyrie is as interesting as the stories. Might add to E. Hoffmann Price's statement concerning the Stanzas of Dzyan that there and there only is the ex- planation of the Easter Island images."   Pride of Place  Francis G. Howes writes from Rugby, England: "I am writing to congratulate you on WT. There is nothing like them in England and they are the only stories that I get a real kick from. I am a research worker and a folk-lore expert who possesses a re- markable library dealing with the occult and the weird, but in the fiction line your maga- zines take pride of place. I put some of your stories, especially those not overburdened with a superfluity of adjectives, on a par with those of Bram Stoker, M. R. James, and Algernon Blackwood. ... I have trav- eled through middle Europe collecting folk- lore and legends and I was astounded at the amount of superstition and credence in the supernatural which abounds among quite civilized people. There are grounds for these beliefs, as I have discovered, especially in the Carpathians and the Black Forest, but to all but my most intimate friends I have re- mained silent for fear of ridicule. I can as- sure your readers that some of your mag- nificent yarns touch alarmingly near to the truth. I was grieved at the passing of H. P. L. Will he ever have a successor? Of re- cent issues I enjoyed The Last Pharaoh most of all. Let us have more of Thomas P. Kelley. Virgil's illustrations are the goods.
