ADVERTISING "Hold your horses -- the ELEPHANTS are coming!" A feast of good stories is waiting you in the August issue of Action Stories. Not only thrilling yarns by old favorites such as R. R. Nix, Hubert Roussel and Wyndham Martyn, but the best work of new writers whose freshness and vigor make its pages sparkle and crisp. Adventure Stories-- real yarns with the true flavor of reality and sincerity--he-man stories told of men with hair on their chests by fellows who have played the game in every corner of the world. Stories of our own West, of the great Hudson Bay country, of the dark, brooding jungles of Africa, and of the eerie wilds of the Philippines and Haiti. Sea Stories-- again the real article, stories of strange shores and strange people and of the wide, screaming, whispering sea--the never-failing stage of gripping drama and thrilling adventure. Detective Stories-- the newest and best of detective fiction goes into the pages of Action Stories. Stories that will lift you out of yourself and send you into the greatest chase in the world--the man hunt. Mystery Stories-- In this most difficult fiction field, Action Stones has rung the bell time and time again. Weird, unusual out-of-the-rut stories are a feature of Action Stories. Not too many of them--just enough to spice and flavor each issue of the magazine. August Issue Out Today!
