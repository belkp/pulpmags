Tell Your Troubles to The Trouble Doctor's Department TROUBLE-- The trouble with most of us is that we think happiness is something to snatch at; we think a force blind as a throw of dice, sends happiness within our hand's reach. And we want to stretch out our hands and grasp what we see, never pausing to think whether it is the real thing or only a good imitation. Now people, just like plants--and, ahem, let us say flowers, because "people" includes the fair and femi- nine sex, too--unfold; or, rather, their natures should unfold and develop. When you and I come to a standstill --don't develop--then we stop seeing and wanting clearly. Instead of want- ing the things that make us happy or, at least, contented citizens of the world, we want something or somebody who (or which) may be all wrong for our own peace of mind. So, all of you who love somebody who, it seems, does not care for you as you wish, or somebody who belongs to another, or somebody who leaves you in doubt--the thing to do is this: For the time being center your attention on something else. Say to yourself that you will spend your time developing and improving yourself, making your- self into the sort of person who is lov- able. And take a little time and find out how many different possibilities there are of enjoyment in this world --which, after all, is the only world of which we have any very definite knowl- edge. Improve yourself. Watch your own nature unfold. Then, as time goes on, your real op- portunity for happiness, for content, will appear, just as surely as the force of gravity pulls ripe apples from the trees. But if your troubles are so heavy on your mind that you want to unburden yourself, just write out what is wrong and mail your letter into "The Trouble Doctor" Room 1515 46 West 24th St. New York City 58
