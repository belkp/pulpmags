WEIRD TALES 381 author, ever to be published in Weird Tales. It is a masterpiece, fit to rank with Howard's Kings of the Night or Lovecraft's Whisperer in Darkness. I feel impelled to thank Mr. Quinn heartily for giving me the opportunity to read so satisfactory, wonder- fully imaginative and beautiful a story. That style is something to dream about. Next, I will mention a very short poem--Lost Dream, dedicated to our departed master Lovecraft, by Emil Petaja. May I express my appreciation of how that little poem coin- cides with one's impressions of the works of Lovecraft? 'One fumbles in his scarlet cloak; I see his slender fingers move--he turns a key . . .' a silver key, of course. Congratu- lations to Mr. Petaja for his splendid little poem. May we hope for more? My next favorite story is Toean Matjan, by Vennette Herron--a very good story, well tied togeth- er, and beautiful style. It is exquisitely writ- ten. I don't know when I have read a more entertaining story, written in better style. In fact, I like the style quite as well as that of Roads, only that it is of course shorter. I am quite sure that I should not care to court that lady. I like The Witch's Mark, and The Hairy Ones Shall Dance. In the latter, it is already rather obvious that the wolfish ma- terialization came from Doctor Zoberg--vide his thick, sinewy wrists! It is right enter- taining. Let me, too, commend most warmly The Inn, in a recent issue. Splendid atmos- phere." Compliment and Complaint Wilfred Wright writes from Toronto: "During the last fifteen years that I have been a consistent reader of WT I have only written twice to the Eyrie, submitting my comments. But your January issue compels me to write for the third time, to express a compliment and a complaint. First the com- pliment. Roads, by Seabury Quinn, stands out as the most beautiful piece of fantasy ever published in any magazine. From early in the story the outcome was obvious, yet at no time did it detract from the beauty or in- terest of the compelling and reverent treat- ment of a sacred theme. Mr. Quinn is in- deed to be congratulated upon his ability, and I wish to extend to him my personal thanks for enriching my Christmas by his magnificent story. Now for the complaint-- or perhaps I should say 'question.' The story Toean Matjan by Vennette Herron--while I CLASSIFIED ADVERTISEMENTS SMALL ADS WORTH WATCHING Authors' Service MANUSCRIPTS WANTED.
