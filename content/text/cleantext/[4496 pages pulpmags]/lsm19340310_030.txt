Going Primitive ~ By Marie Hoyt THE doorbell rang and Delphine Parker's movements suddenly became feverish. She grabbed for her purse and hat, took one last look in the mirror, patted her hair expertly, added just a bit more rouge, and then, satisfied, snapped out the light. She doubted if she had ever looked better. Well, that was as it should be. She'd probably never have another chance like this one. She walked into the living room and at once the excited light in her eyes faded. Her face became absolutely expressionless. "0h, it s you, Tommy," she said slowly. "I thought you were still at school." "Came home for the holiday, Dell. I thought maybe you'd be surprised to see me, but I didn't ex- pect this tumultuous welcome. I mean, you could have controlled yourself a little better. Not shown such wild joy. Maybe even re- frained from leaping forward into my arms like this." "Well"- defensively- "you could not expect me to have the band out, when you didn't even tell me you were coming. If you'd told me, I could have saved the evening for you. As it is, I've got a date." "I gather as much from your opening remark. Somebody I know?" "Martin French."
