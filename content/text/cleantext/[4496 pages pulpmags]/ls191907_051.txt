46 The Time for Dreams    pilgrimage without our wantonly adding to the blows and hurts that each one of us must bear?  Let us resolve to honor the prophets, including the minor prophets who may be near us, not only for their sake, but for our own.  Remember that the beautiful flowers in our hearts can never flourish or come to full bloom unless we root out the poi- son weeds of envy.  Don't wait until your friend is dead     before you give him the credit that is his due. Acknowledge his fine achieve- ments, his industry, his high purpose. Do it now. Praise him, if he deserves praise. Speak generously of him to others. Rejoice with him when fortune smiles, when triumphs come. Be sin- cere about it, be happy about it, and by so doing, you will win smiles of fortune for yourself.  And you will gain in health!  That is the law.     THE TIME FOR DREAMS  By L. M. Thornton LIST, little maid, with the eager feet And the tender eyes of blue, Laugh while the world seems glad and sweet Sing while you think it true. Gather roses and lilies fair, Dance with the dancing streams, Keep your heart while you can from care, Youth is the time for dreams. List, little maid, with the waving hands And the plaited, golden hair, One in the wide world understands All that you do and dare. One is glad for your eager heart And your smile that ever gleams, Yours is of life the golden part, Youth is the time for dreams. List, little maid, with the faith sublime, And the trust that angels know, Griefs may lie in the lap of Time And your bounding step grow slow. But one who wearies of stress and strife And of joy not all it seems, Is glad, from the depths of his jaded life, That youth is the time for dreams.
