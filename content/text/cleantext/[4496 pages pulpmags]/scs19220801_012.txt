No Place for Husbands 9 industry at first hand. His conscience was quite alabaster as he hired a ma- chine at two o'clock and bade the chauf- feur to drive to the Hal Harris studio. A swift run over a hard, dusty road, and John was walking under a high wooden arch onto the Harris "lot." He entered the door marked "Office" in a low, single-storied building. Near the door a shirt-sleeved young man with a cold cigarette stuck between his lips was clacking a typewriter. He looked at Harlan--looked again--and stood up respectfully. "How do you do, Mr. Harlan." He smiled his best, though evidently won- dering what the blazes the banker was doing there. John was taken rather by surprise. "How did you know me?" he asked, rather pleased. "I guess any wide-awake newspaper reporter would recognize John Harlan by sight--and I used to be a reporter before I went into publicity work. Were you looking for anyone in par- ticular. Mr. Harlan?" John hesitated. He felt a little em- barrassed--much as he had when a callow Lawrenceville boy, he dropped back-stage for his first chorus girl. There was no need, he thought, of tell- ing this press agent all his business. Perhaps Peggy wasn't around. "I thought I'd like to see some movie- making from the inside," he explained. "This studio was the handiest." The press agent scented publicity possibilities. "We're shooting some â€˜interiors' out on the studio floor," he suggested. "I'd be glad to show you around." John nodded, and the p. a. led the way through a pine door at the back of the room. The studio interior was a broad ex- panse of wooden floor, bare except for one "set" in a far corner. Things seemed to be quite lively over there. Electricians were jerking around banks of Klieg lights mounted on wheels. A girl in the smeary yellow make-up of the movies and wearing a daringly cut pink bathing-suit passed and smiled at John. The press agent asked his visitor to wait a moment in the middle of the floor. John didn't mind; he was boy- ishly interested, though a line of Kliegs barricaded the "set" off from the rest of the studio. The publicity man came up briskly with a tall, stoop-shouldered man in puttees. He was swarthy and had a mustache like that of the villain in a Bill Hart shootin' film. "Mr. Harlan, this is Mr. Siegel, our director and Western manager for Hal Harris Productions," introduced the p. a. "Honored to think a big man like you would visit our little studio," drawled Siegel bootlickingly, regarding John with a jaundiced and rather shifty eye. "Like to watch us work a little?" They escorted their visitor across the studio floor and through the Klieg stockade. The "set," which was built to represent the lobby of a summer hotel, was bathed in a strong white light. John walked over a soft carpet. A cushioned divan occupied the center of the lobby, and there were soft cushions on the carpet around it. Draped at ease upon the cushions was a group of pretty girls clad uni- formly in rather startling pink single- piece bathing-suits. They eyed the visitor with mild curiosity. Suddenly one of the girls sprang up from a cushion and hurried over to John. He recognized the lithe form of Peggy. "Oh, you decided to come after all. Jack," she approved. "That's fine-- you always were a game sport." Siegel frowned, and the p. a. opened understanding eyes. Peggy calmly ap- propriated Harlan, ignoring them both,
