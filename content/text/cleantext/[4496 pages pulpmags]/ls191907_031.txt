DREAM OF HEAVEN  By Morgan Ireland   LO, I was lord of heaven With all its windy streets. And all its lost, dead women, In silver winding-sheets,  Came singing by before me In an unearthly choir Beneath the flaming minarets Of opalescent fire;  Came singing by before me Upon the windy street, Ladies with ghostly, windblown hair And silver-sandaled feet.  The while I searched among them, In hope to find again The lady I had loved and lost When I was but a man;  A lady of most touching grace, Of most contagious mirth, A lady I had loved and lost When I was on the earth.  Alas! The search was futile, Futile and vain, because My love was not among them: I know not where she was.  26
