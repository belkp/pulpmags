THE YEARS AHEAD 101    the promise of the years ahead, and wondered self-reproachfully, that she could have doubted life.  "It will be worth it all," she said to herself tenderly--"My big girl--"  It was before the summer which was to have been crowned with that first promised visit that Marjorie died; died leaving her baby a few days old. Grief did not crush Emily; she could not have the luxury of giving way to grief.     After all, there were her other chil- dren, whom she loved, with their cease- less demands upon her time and strength. In the stricken sleeplessness of the first nights after Jim's despair- ing telegram, one gleam of solace came to her:  "Perhaps Jim will let me take care of Marjorie's baby," she said to herself. "Perhaps she will grow up to seem like Marjorie--"      Lines Written on a Day of Doubt  By Virginie Griffiths THERE was a woman in the hospital today-- One of the kind with satin slippers and Ideal perfume; And she thought we were "wonderful" and "truly angels of mercy." She would "just love to be a nurse." And now I am wondering-- I am wondering just how much she would love Those three years of training; The long weeks of night duty With the terrible feeling about three o'clock in the morning That you must sleep or die. The worry on tonsil night for fear some youngster may hemorrhage. The Hamburg steak and poor coffee at midnight supper; The getting up during the day for lectures. And the out-patient service where you go down into the slums To help some Italian or Polish woman have her baby. And the operating room where you stand for hours on a tiled floor And serve an exacting surgeon-- And then polish the instruments and wash bloodsoaked linen. And, after graduating, the living in a suitcase, With the constant companionship of a sick person--day and night. And men taking the attitude of "but I can tell you"-- "You understand things of that sort." I am wondering just how much she would love it.
