B States, of the World, preached :i sermon when he was young, _ which grows younger as the world grows older. 11 was: '- Look up and not down. Look out and not in. And lend a hand.” Just now there is abundant reason for apply- ing this to the business of our country. From everywhere we hear business men talk- ing optimism. “ Business looks tine,” they say to us when we talk with them about advertis- ing, “and it’s going to be better still.” Advertisers are thermometers and baromet- ers both. They, who invest tluir money in the intangible asset of human nature through advertising, are the most sensitive men on earth as to business conditions. True, bad times alTect them differently; for when busi- ness looks gloomy some of them advertise the more and others less; the difference is only a matter of their own courage. But when times look good, these advertisers all act alike,—they all want to advertise to catch the trade that the country has ready for them. To-day what the American advertisers are doing is to ‘‘look up and not down.” Business looks up. Credit looks up. Prosperity looks up. Let us all look up and match our advertising friends with equal confidence. {Continued on Pqrc 4) Index to Advertisements Architect*	page Fitzpatrick, P. W.	lot MarI.nK.in. P.

In the following letter you note two things: (1)	That the Scott Paper Company offered one article direct to the consumer, and that Everybody’s brought more returns than all the other publications put together. (2)	That the other article advertised was sold in stores, the advertising aiming to awaken public interest in it,—and that the Jailers were widely influenced by this advertisement. SCOTT PAPER COMPANY Philadelphia, December, S iqio. Robert Frotiiingiiam, Everybody's Magazine. Dear Sir. It will interest you to know of the returns received from your publication on the products we are advertising therein. OaScotlissiie Tawds the hygienic paper towel.on which we used a number of magazines on a mail-order basis, we received more dircct returns from Everybody's than from all the other publications put together, and from a class of people which use this towel in large quantities, such as schools, factories, hotels, ctc. In nearly every case we have received orders. On Sunilissue (the only balsamized toilet tissue) the direct returns are much harder to trace; but the writer, on a recent trip, found that the trade referred to the advertising in Everybody's, to the exclusion of all other publications used, and this same condition has been evidenced in the letters received here from the trade. These results demonstrate to us. beyond the question of a doubt, that the influence of Everybody's on the trade is greater than that of any publication that we have used, and that your readers are of a class that are quick to appreciate the value of a superior article. So our campaign has been laid out for the coming year as with this practical demonstration of your efficiency in mind. Very truly yours, Arthur H. Scott. But one thing is not mentioned in that letter: All the advertisements, save the last, were small, only quartet pages. Which shows, once more, that no advertisement in Everybody’s is so small as to escapc the eyes of its readers.EVERYB« iDV'S MAGAZINE MODEL EA-4 CYL, 30 HORSEPOWER.

Perhaps among these Union soldiers about to venture into Petersburg—or among the besieged Con- federates who tensely waited for the fire of this gun—which roared destruction just after this photograph was taken—perhaps, in that dread place, some one near and dear to you moved and fought and fell. To every American who gazes on a scene like this comes a sense of his own heritage, for the great Crisis that tested both North and Souih. fuund neither wanting in skill or cour- age, and made our national Government, our unity, brotherhood and character. But where did we get this war-photograph? Why do we print it here?

You have played the most interesting game in the world—and you have lost. And you will play it again and you’ll lose again. Why? Because you haven’t a chance in the world. The wisest man who plays the races, or speculates, hasn’t a chance. We are all “suckers” together. How do I know? Because I have played both ends—and lost. J uni an expert on horse-racing. I made $7.30 grow into $1,500,000.00 in less than two years, giving tips on the races. And I lost it all betting on my own tips. I uni an expert on nuning-stocks. I have induced the public to part with $200,000,000.00 for Nevada securities. 1 engineered the Goldfield boom. 1 was on “the inside.” I got in on all the good things. I haven’t got a cent today. I have gambled since J was a kid. I have been in all the gambling hells that count for anything. I have as good luck as the next man and a lot more experience. 1 have won all kinds of money. But 1 have lost every cent. All I have to show for my ten years’ work is a large fund of experience, some odd recollections, and this firm conviction: That the public hasn’t got a chance. I have no intention of telling you a hard luck story, but I do want to tell you how the game is worked. It’s not all bad. It’s not all good. The advertisement! !n Everybody's Magazine are indexed.

I want to tell you How your money goes Who gets it What they <lo with it What chance you have of winning it hack. 1 want you to know the game as I know it, see it as I have seen it—from the inside. This is not a moral expose. It’s a life story. It is just what the title says: “My Adventures with Your Money.” It’s a great yarn—a real adventure story. And it’s true. Gf.orgf. Graham Rice MR. RICE'S story begins in the April Number of ADVEN- TURE. In the telling, he is wholly unconventional, perfectly un- embarrassed, frank, cordial, straight- forward. even bold. Me will take you into his confidence from the beginning. His intellect glories in it -and so will yours. And it may save you from speculating again. He can’t guarantee that, but he hopes so. Anyhow, you will get the most ex- citing tale you could possibly want to read. You will learn, in the first article, how Mr. Rice gave tips on the races. Ever hear of Maxim&Gay? Ever hear the phrase “one best bet"? George Graham Rice invented them both. And he invented many other things that kept him in funds for two years. Ho will tell you that first. He will tell it in the Ridgway Company's new magazine, AD- VENTURE. Good name for a magazine that publishes his story, don't you think ? And a good magazine, too, as you will see.

You need no longer try to be contented with a pocket-book so slim that you arc afraid to touch it. The Clover Club, a club organized and run by the Best Known Magazine in the World, The Delineator, will gladly reveal to you a recipe guaranteed to fatten the thinnest purse. Tn other words, the Clover Club offers any girl and every girl who wants more money the opportunity to earn money, and the way is pleasant and dignified, too. Here arc just two or three extracts from letters of girls who are trying the Clover Club wav: “I am very, very much in love with the Clover Club. It is indeed easy to accomplish the light task you set, and I am very thankful to you for showing me this rosy way to make money.” “I think it such pleasant work that I am devoting every minute to it.” “It is great fun belonging to the Clover Club and gives me lots of pleasure as well as profit.” “Many, many thanks for the check. It really seems as if I must be some one else, for I have never before had showered upon me so much good luck." “It is certainly delightful to be receiving money for the little I do. I flunk you heartily anil wish every success to the Clover Club." Every mail brings letters like this letters that would convince even a sour old cynic that there's nothing difficult nor disagreeable about earning money a la Clover Club. And best of all, there are no conditions to bar out any girl that wants to join. In the first place there are no dues of any kind. Then it doesn’t matter one single bit where you live. Our members are to be found in city, town, and village in every section of our great country. It's immaterial, too, how long you have lived. As I've often said, one may be as young as Red Riding Hood or as old as Mother Goose and still find a warm welcome within our ranks. We have girls of eight and “girls" approaching eighty. A great many of our girls arc married, but that tact in no way hinders their being one of u*. "I fee! as enthusiastic about it all,” writes one, “as though 1 were a really, truly girl instead of .1 married woman with a little girl of my own." You may devote as much or as little of vour The Club Brooch of Solid Gold, set with a Genuino Diamond. time to the work as you like, and last hut not least, remember, you do not have to be talented por even business trained. The one great thing is the desire to earn money of your own—money that does not have to be asked for nor accounted for to a single soul. If that desire is yours, join the Clover Club! You’ll find it means more than money, too, for from time to time our members receive valu- able gifts from the Treasurc Box. For instance, there’s the Club pin that is given to every girl entering the Golden Chapter of the Clover Club. And such a beautiful pin as it is’ In the first place it’s solid gold, and in the second place it contains a genuine diamond, and in the third place it comes from Tiffany’s. Nothing is too good for the Clover Club. Here’s a photograph so you may get a little idea of its beauty, and here’s a letter or two that tell you what the girls who arc now wearing it think of it: “I write to thank you for the five-dollar check, the sixth spoon, and the dear little diamond pin which I think perfectly beautiful. I am sure I do not know how to thank you. Can only say 1 cer- tainly appreciate it and am so proud of it." “The beautiful diamond pin surpasses all my expectations and anticipations. It is lovely. W.irds can not express my appreciation of it. You c.iil't know how greatly pleased with it I am. I wish to thank you again and again.” “Mv pin came to-day, and to say that I am delighted docs not half express my feelings. It is a iiitle beauty, and I want all of the Clover Club girls to have one just like it. Do tell them not to rest content till they own one ” To enter the Golden Chapter and wear the beautiful diamond brooch, you must first be a member of the Clover Club, so don’t put off another day finding out all about that.

Between these points lie the mighty states of the Indian Kmpire, towering mountain ranges, and broad and stately rivers—the Indus, the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Irawadi, the Martaban —all flowing to the sea from the high Himalayan gable of the earth. In this vast area, with its jungles, ils deserts, ils tum- bling hill country, lies one of the world's greatest hunting grounds, a region of big game second Africa alone. My one wish was to test my nerves on a tiger. Time and again, around the camp fires of the African veldt. I had heard tales of the big striped cat. Men that knew told me there was no quarry afoot that compared with it in cunning and ferocity. In their minds, it was the most difficult to hunt of all the hunted ones. And so. with a re- solve to test the truth of the cantp-lirc stories. I took ticket for Calcutta sir.ee there are no tigers in Africa and from there pushed deep into the Indian jungles. It will no doubt astonish many to hear that India runs so close to Africa in its wildness. One easily pictures Africa as a home of big game. Comparatively speak- ing. it is sparsely populated, and much room remains everywhere within it for uncounted hosts of wild things. But that India, teem- ing with a population of more than three hundred million souls, should still have space for big game of many kinds seems very nearly incredible. For the Empire averages one hundred and sixty-seven human beings t<> the square mile. Then, again, this astonishes: Not only is there room for game in plenty, but much of it is of the most dangerous sort. On an average.

THE PREPARATIONS TAKE ON THE ASPECT OT A HCCK PICNIC. THE NATIVE ATTENDANTS* CAMP. PREPARING AN ELEPHANT !•'().{ THE HUNT. Si) 2Tracking the Man-Iviller beasts. Consider these figures—statistics compiled by the government; they show both the abundance of man-killing game and the mortality due to their ravages: In one year hyenas killed 28, elephants 29, bears 87, leopards .$01. wolves 829, tigers S09, snakes 15,261, and other animals 1,127 a total of 18,471. There must be many others not accounted for. In the same year 48,400 cattle fell a prey to marauding beasts. Remember, too, that crocodiles, which are heavy destroyers, are not men- tioned in the list. But that the destruc- tion is not all one-sided may be realized from the fact that during the same period that is, in a single year—27,000 dangerous animals were destroyed, besides 116,500 snakes. Could such a condition exist else- where than in India? I think not. The indifference of the natives toward this situation is unbelievable. For ages they have suffered, have paid their toll of death, and yet they remain passive, like their cattle. Europeans that know the country will unite in telling you that the timidity of the native encourages the beasts to attack human life. One white man cyn- ically remarked to me that the life of the average Hindu was so miserable, anyway, that he made little effort to preserve it. At any rate, it is true that the Hindu willingly leaves the country to its wild life. By the millions he crowds to the cities, where he is content to fester, to exist in hopeless pov- erty and squalor. Out of justice to the Hindu, however, it should be said that to a great extent the laws made by foreigners are responsible for this. The conqueror will not let the native own a rifle, lest he may some day wish to rule and so turn the weapon 011 his British overlords. Naturally, without a means of self-defense, the native shuns the jungle. Hut though India is the habitat of the leopard and the tiger -two of the world s most dangerous beasts it is not to be com- pared with Africa for its perils. Of Course, if one hunts for danger in India it may be found there readily—danger enough to daunt the stoutest heart. But. for the most part, the Indian methods of s|«irt arc- little more than child's play beside the Dark Continent's perilous amusement. In India, for one thing, there is no hard- ship. Most of the shooting i>- dune from a howdah strapped to an elephant'- back, in which one is literally carried to the same. Men with one arm or one leg or otherwise crippled may hunt with success in Indian jungles; but not in Africa, where, as a rule, the hunter faces the game afoot. In Africa, furthermore, one usually hunts alone, with a native shikaree, and perhaps an extra gun-bearer in attendance. Hut in India the crowd turns out; it is a party, ordinarily. For the outsider, however, shooting is made difficult in India. Permission is re- quired from the British ruler and also from the district's native rajah. Unless you be- long to a party of officials, military or civil, you might as well seek elsewhere for your hunting. A smattering of Hindustani is imperative. You will require also the trained shikar elephants; and as these are owned by officials and native princes, unless you have the proper introduction you can- not rent them for love nor money. And elephants are absolutely essential on ac- count of the nature of the hunting grounds. Providing, however, that you have the influence, the best ground awaits you be- tween the Himalayas and the River Ganges, and in the country along the Brahma- putra. Burma, Assam, and Singapore are also splendid shikar grounds. But apart from these domains, perhaps the best and most accessible place i> northern Bengal, any part of which can be reached by rail- way. It was at Jubbulpur, in this region, that 1 took part in my first Indian hunt. By good fortune, in Calcutta I found Mr. Mortimer, an English friend, who was just starting on a tiger hunt. Through him, everything was made easy for me. After our passports were issued, our outfit made ready, and our servants engaged, we boarded a train of the Indian railway. For a great stretch, the line parallels the Ganges, traversing the depths of a miasmatic jungle, an impenetrable mesh of foliage defended against human invasion by a riotous pro- fusion of thorn vines and other creepers. One saw at a glance here why one needed an elephant to lake one through the jungle. On our arrival at Jubbulpur, where the government’s elephants are stabled. I was astonished to find that a number of women were to go with us on our hunt. In fact, what struck me first at the stables was the sight of them strolling under their parasols among the big beasts and the native at- tendants. To my eye now, the shikar be- gan to take on the aspect of a big picnic.Evcrvl>o< 1 y's Magiizinc There were thc huge white tents, the pic- turesquely dressed and undressed natives, the soldiers, the women in white dresses, ready to watch thc jungle tragedy from THE AUTIIOK AND HIS PET LEOPARD CUD. a loy: on their elephant's hack, the men in white duck and pith helmets—almost a fete, it Mtmcd. Almost everybody, too, was a lord, a >ir. or an honorable, all related to some one having a hand in the British Indian government. And, in amount and quality, the provisions brought along would have done credit to a first-rate hotel. 1C very thing was ready now. The ele- phants were driven up and commanded to fall upon their knees. Men and women climbed to the howdahs by ladders. The head shikaree gave the signal; each elephant heaved to his feet like a mountain in an earthquake; and off we started in a long string toward the Nerbudda River. To me, it looked as if the big cat would not have much of a chance. Squatted on the neck of each elephant sat its mahout, thc native driver. A steel goad helped him to guide the unwieldy beast; and I’m bound to say the mahout used it freely. These were shikar elephants we rode, trained for the hunt, sup|>osed to stand when a tiger charges, and not to flinch when a rifle is fired from the howdah. I say supposed, for few elephants live that do not fear the tiger. Later, you will see what mine ditl—incidentally, what he did to me — when charged. Besides these shikar brutes, there were other elephants used for beating up thc game. On them, our native aides rode along, unprotected by a howdah and sitting on pads strapped to thc elephants like saddles. My howdah, like all the others, resembled nothing so much as a big cradle. It was fitted with side racks for the guns. Gener- ally, two rifles are carried, one a small- bore, high-velocity arm of, say, seven millimeter caliber; and a double-barreled express running between .450 and .600 cali- ber. The double .577 is still a great favor- ite among Indian sportsman; justly so, too, for its bullet has a crushing impact cal- culated to stop the charge of almost any beast. Many Indian hunters favor also a twelve or an eight gauge double-barreled shotgun, using spherical balls. A great advantage of such guns is the ease with which they may be sighted, for they have only a bead at ihe muzzle, and may be sighted bv glancing down the rib. At close quarters, to be able to take a snap- shot with a good chance of hitting the mark is a big factor of safety. Again, sights for long distances are superfluous in thc dense Indian jungle, for nearly always the game i^ seen elose at hand. say. at between thirty and sixty yards. So the great necessity is to be able to shootTracking the Man-Killer quickly with some feeling of confidence in your aim. After a consultation, our shikaree turned into a part of the jungle where a kill had been made the night before. A "kill" is the carcass of an animal slain by the tiger or other beast. Ordinarily, the killer hangs about in the immediate neighborhood, waiting to make a second meal at nightfall and in the meanwhile driving the jackals, vultures, and hyenas from its prey. As the tiger is nocturnal, it dozes during daylight in some shady spot near the banquet place. Furthermore, it usually shuns dens and very rarely hunts long in one particular district. This accounts for the fact that the lion has practically become extermi- nated in India, while the tiger is appar- ently as abundant as ever. As we approached the "kill," the shikaree called the sahibs' attention t<> a lluck of gaunt vultures perched in near-by trees. It was an auspicious sign. Besides, some of the elephants were twitching their ears and trunks and treading uneasily, having evidently got wind of their foe. So, to rout out the beast, the beaters made a de- tour of half a mile to get behind it, while we. the hunters, took our stand at the jun- gle's edge. We were to wait there until the tiger had been driven up to our guns. As the elephant walks six miles an hour, it was not long before the din of the drums and shouts of the beaters reverberated through the jungle, scaring monkeys, pea- cocks, smaller birds, and dozens <>f other jungle dwellers before them. Sambur deer, barking deer, swamp deer broke past us in twos and threes; and a diminutive mouse deer, not over twelve inches high, plunged between my elephant’s legs. With a snort of fear the huge beast turned to bolt, and had it not been for the mahout’s steel goad. I might have been carried off into the thorn jungle, and perhaps brained against the branches. This nervousness on the part of my mount did not give me much faith in his alleged courage before a tiger’s charge. The din made by the beaters grew louder, and we heard, too, the peculiar drumming sound made by some of the elephants— their sign that a dangerous animal was near. This brought us to our feet in the howdahs. lingers on triggers. Just then a deer in wild fright flew past us. and the shikaree, pointing to the left, whi.-|iered “Tiger, sahib." I saw him then. Before me was tile mighty cat. his jaw almost to the ground as he sneaked, half crouching, through the jungle. II< stood for an instant in suspense. Then, as I was about to shoot, my elephant, with a scream of rage, charged straight at the beast, shaking me clear out of the howdah into the bushes, which luck- ily broke my fall. At the same time, one of my companions fired, and wounded the tiger. Altogether, there was plenty of ex- citement for a moment. My rifle exploded as I landed, and that, with the elephant's trumpeting, the tiger's howling roar, and the cries of the beaters made a nerve- racking din. But the tiger was undaunted. He met the charge of my enraged elephant, and with a lithe spring was on its head, sinking claws and teeth into the huge beast's neck and trunk, while the mahout beat at him with his goad, and the ele- phant tried to crush its enemy on the ground. Because of the position of the two combatants, it was impossible for my com- panions to shoot. Resenting the blows of the mahout's goad, the big cat sank his claws into the fellow’s thigh, and tried to pull him down. This revived me to action and, seizing my rifle, 1 fired the remaining barrel into the tiger's spine. With a roar of pain he fell backward to the ground, and the maddened elephant, bleeding profusely from many wounds, tusked and trampled the beast to a pulp bsfore it could be driven off. The fascinating part of big-game hunting is that the unexpected generally happens. I was not prepared, however, to have an elephant that had bolted from a harmless mouse ‘leer charge a tiger. But that’s what happened: and you may be sure that I kept this incident in mind during all my future experiences. Our next tiger hunt was of a different character. It resembled more the hunting in Africa, and was conducted from a look- out platform, >>r imuharii, constructed in a tree. The village shikaree informed us that a tiger was carrying off the village cattle at night; so. to entice our quarry into the vicinity of the nine hum, half a dozen domestic buffaloes were tied up as a bail. We were informed that the marauder was an old offender, and although a hundred attempts had been made by the village shikarees to destroy it, ii had escaped all their efforts. In fact, the villagers had begun to believe the tiger possessed super-IT WAS A SPL»:SDll> S1«HT TO SUE THE MONSTROUS ELEPHANTS TAKE TO THE WATER. natural powers. Hut Mortimer and I de- cided to try our luck on the village curse. It is far from comfortable to sit in a cramped position all night on an unsteady platform, in a tree that sways with the wind, waiting for a shot at a dark patch that moves in the blackness, while the fireflies wave their lamps in your face and every conceivable insect beats about your head, to say nothing of a lizard or two that crawls into your shirt. Three hours of misery had passed when I heard the bullock near me begin tugging at his tether. Straining my eyes for a glimpse of the expected tiger, I saw a black shape moving across the open- ing. A dull thud followed; afterward there was a bellow, and for a moment sounds of a struggle arose. Then all was still. I waited perhaps half an hour before I heard the sloppy, tearing sound that is made by an animal eating un-bled meat. I could hardly see to shoot, but I leveled my rifle, which had luminous sights, at the dark mass, and fired. A roar of pain burst from the target, telling me I had reached my mark. The echo of the shot had hardly died away when two loud reports on n-.v right told me, too, that something of importance was happening with my companion. Descending the tree, I made my way cau- tiously to the black mass I had shot at, cov- ering it in case it should rise and charge. Then my friend, Mortimer, cried at the top of his voice: “I've got him!” “I have, too!” I answered and. to make sure, I fired another shot at my fallen quarry. It did not move. To make doubly sure, however, I lighted a bunch of dry reeds, and saw to my astonishment that, instead of a tiger, I had killed a huge leopard. The unex- pected again! Again, while I was looking over my kill, I heard two additional reports from Mor- timer's heavy rifle; and then in rapid suc- cession half a dozen shots from his auto- matic pistol. I knew there was trouble, and. crying at the top of my voice, ran stumbling through the darkness toward him, loading as I advanced. To my relief I saw Mortimer standing in an opening with the huge form of a tiger at his feet. He told me that just as I first tired he saw his tiger. He fired and the beast went flown. As it rose again, he gave it the other barrel; and then, feeling certain the animalTilt SHIKARI: £, HAM'.INC. OVER THE SIDE OF THE HOWDAII, DISCOVEK>:D THE TICKR's Ii;All. IN THE MUD. was dead, lie descended from his muchani. Hut when he was within twenty yards, it again leaped up and charged. He fired two more shots in rapid succession. Thc beast rolled over with a roar, only to rise and char"-: for a second time. Whipping out his Luger pistol, he poured bullets into thc beast as it came on, until one well-directed shot penetrated the tiger's brain and it fell at his feet. Next morning, when thc shikarees brought the carcasses into camp to skin, they found nine bullets in the big cat’s body. An incident in this hunt illi'stratcs thc peculiar mental processes of some Asiatics. The government gives a reward varying from thirty t<» fifty rupees to any native or natives who kill a tiger. So as soon as the village shikaree saw Mortimer's tiger, he immediately recognized it as the cattle thief and claimed thc reward from Mortimer, saying that the sahib had destroyed his tiger and deprived him of the government reward. Mortimer, who was rich, decided to pay rather than argue. Then came another piece of brilliant Asiatic reasoning. The reward was thirty rupees for a tiger killed from a tree or an 20 7 elephant's back, anil fifty for one killed on foot. When Mortimer handed over thirty rupees to the shikaree. the native counted it with dignified gravity and tlun. turning with a you-tried-to-cheat-me air. said, “The sahib forgets I hat the reward for a tiger killed on fool is fifty rupees." My friend roared with laughter and. thinking the joke on himself was worth it. he paid the extra twenty rupees. What is more, wc found at the end of our hunt that wc had to pay to all our natives a reward for cverv animal we killed. My next tiger experience was with a man- eater, an animal that preyed on human beings c\ lusively. Man-eaters are by no means infrequent, and whenever one is on a raid, it strikes terror into the hearts of every villager in the district. \ single tiger of this sort may prey on twenty different villages, visiting one to-day, another to- morrow. To my mind, there is nothing that so chills one's blood with horror as this sinister brute that passes, silently as a cloud's shadow, from hut to hut. looking for an entrance. The native lies awake lool ing through the opening of the hut. The crack- ling of a twig startles him. lie str.iin- his eye.-.E very bod y's M agazine and trembles with apprehension. He has nothing but a knife with which to defend himself. All at once, as if born out of the silence, silhouetted against the moon's silver flood, there stands the apparition, the man- eater And after that The natives crowd round the deserted hut and there is mourning in the village. A daily occur- rence in India. It was with exultation that I started off one day with Mortimer to a village where a man- eater had been seen the day before. I took my nine-millimeter llaenel-Mannlicher rifle and a thirty-five Remington auto-loader for fast work at close quarters, should the beast charge. When we reached the village we were taken to a mticharn, which Mortimer mounted, fur it was already dark. I re- mained below, as I thought I should like to have it out with the tiger in the African mode, that is. on the level of the ground. Hour after hour passed without incident. It was getting toward morning, and I was dozing, half asleep, when Mortimer’s double express banged like thunder twice on the platform over my head. In a flash I was on my feet An instant later I saw the tiger not thirty yards away. I fired hap- hazard. but did no evident damage, and it vanished in the jungle. Mortimer was con- vinced he had wounded the beast, so we waited till daylight, and searched for the tiger's trail. It was eventually found by a native, who. after following it for a few yards, picked up a large leaf of the teak tree, and cried " Koon, sahib, koou " point- ing to a drop oi blood. This was a good sign. As we were afraid the beast might get away, we took after it on foot, instead of sending for elephants. Our shikarees, how- ever, did not like the idea of hunting the man-eater on foot, and protested sullenly. So I told them to walk behind, for I could follow the trail easily, as it passed down the center of a dry ravine. Eventually we reached a point where the ravine made an abrupt turn past a small thicket of tamarisk. We divided our forces. Mortimer going one side and I the other. As I came to the end of the thicket, a water* hole met my view and what I desired to see more than anything else—there was the tiger, lying in the water with only his head out. Taking careful aim. I fired, but though my -hot hit. it did not kill. With a short, sharp roar the big cat sprang from the water. and rushed around the other side of the thicket. A second later I heard two shots from Mortimer’s express, a roar, and then a cry for help. Running toward him at top speed, I saw a sight that made my blood run cold. Mortimer was on the ground, his white clothing covered with blood, while standing over him, its mouth dripping with gore, was the tiger. The shikarees who had our extra rifles and had gone by another route to the pool, came rushing up, breaking through the bush almost opposite the tiger. In a moment it charged them and they opened fire, but none of their shots stopped the brute. One of the shikarees dropped his gun and ran; the other stood, firing as the beast advanced. When the magazine was empty the native tried to reload it, but too late; for the mighty bulk of the animal flew through the air and bore the unlucky fellow to earth. For some reason the beast used only its claws. It fell over the body of the man, and then began wiping its face with its paw like a house cat. I got down on the ground and crawled nearer to get a better shot. A cobra in the grass raised his head in front of me, thrust out his tongue, and vanished. At last I was within easy range. I got on my knee and lired, and at the shot the tiger sank in a limp heap on its victim, dead. When I reached Mortimer, he was sitting up, wiping the blood from his clothes with grass. He told his story: “You’d no sooner lired than the tiger came bounding round the thicket. I couldn’t take aim: 1 just lired, hoping for a lucky shot. The tiger sprang at me—down I went. The blow blackened my brain for a while. When I got my senses I felt the huge body of the animal across me and hot blood flowing over my neck and head. Whether it was my blood or not I did not know. I wondered how long I had to live and just waited to feel his teeth in my flesh. To my surprise he got up and ran. I am pretty sore but still alive. Shake hands.” In the meantime the shikaree who had run was attending his companion. When we reached him the poor fellow was hardly breathing. He was carried to the village, where he died in about six hours, his skull having been fractured by a blow from the beast's heavy paw. On examining the liger. I found that the tirst shot 1 tired, which had an expansive bullet, had shattered the bottom jaw after passing through the bridge of the nose.

Again the unexpected! While on another tiger hunt, 1 had the good fortune U> witness one of the grandest combats a man could hope to see. It was a combat that would have made the em- perors of Rome applaud—one that brought to me the realization of what the heroic animal life of the jungle really is. I was perched on a mucharu built in a solid old tree on the jungle’s edge, waiting lor a tiger that had a kill not more than fifty yards away. The scraggy trees of the swamp were silhouetted against a sun that blazed in the west like a ball of incandescent copper. The day insects ceased their hum, and the fairy life of the night, whose dawn is the setting day, came buzzing in myriads from their hiding places, like the ballet of an elfin opera. A stately crane stepped daintily through the reeds, and fat-breasted little birds of brilliant plumage settled on twigs, kissed, milled their feathers, and put their tiny heads beneath their wings. I breathed deep. The swamp air, sweet to my nostrils, almost intoxicated me. Then all at once 1 heard heavy feet forcing their way through the tangle. The giant grass ahead of me swayed and bent down, and a moment later a splendid buffalo cow breasted her way out of the entanglement and stood in the open. Suspiciously she sniffed the air. and then, throwing her face toward heaven, she bellowed like thunder. I seemed to shake in the tree. A moment later an answer came, as if from miles away, and the cow replied. She shook her mighty horns and then drove them into the earth. She walked up to the tiger's kill and sniffed it. Again the thunder of her throat burst the silence. Suddenly she showed uneasiness. She turned and looked with lowered head past my tree. My eyes followed hers. My tiger was there, just on the jungle’s edge, within its protecting grass, skulking silently along, with his white belly sweeping the ground. He saw the buffalo. He stopped motionless, save for his twitching, writhing tail. The cow scattered the loose earth with a -troke of her hoof. Shoot I could not. I would not. I wanted to see the jungle drama. Slowly the tiger crept into the open, never straightening his elastic body, his eyes fastened on the cow. His jaw hung half open and dripping. Round and round in a circle he went, trying to get behind the buffalo; but she was too quick for him. He paused and drew himself into a ball, his tail lashing the ground. Then, like a rocket, his body shot through the air, as with a thunderous bellow the buffalo charged, her mighty horns leveled. They met in the air. The shock hurled both to earth. In a flash they were up, and with another roar, another bellow, they charged. The tiger missed, but his leap landed him behind the buffalo, and, turning swiftly, he sprang upon her back. But be- fore his teeth sank into her flesh, she threw herself over and rolled. The tiger, to pro- tect himself, loosened his grip; again he seized her as she sprang to her feet. But the cow shook him off, and with a roar charged, bowling him over, and forcing liim against the tamarisk. Blood was flow- ing from her bellowing mouth, streaming, too, from the claw wounds in her back, as she retreated to get charging distance to finish him. But he was still fit to fight, and again he sprang. He landed between her mighty horns, his body hanging over her face. His teeth sank into her flesh. Blood filled his mouth and ran down the cow’s sides. She roared in pain, and, lowering her head, charged at a stout tree with her burden. A feeble roar told I he tiger's distress. In a limp heap he fell to the ground. The buffalo drew back and measured her mark. A short rush forward, a twist of the horn, and she had gored him mortally. He tried to crawl away. A roar of victory shook the swamp grass as the cow charged again. She lifted the huge beast on her horn and dashed him to death. Night crept on, and the cow disappeared in the darkness that fell like a curtain over the last act of the jungle tragedy. I wanted to say something to the splendid animal in her victory, to stroke her scarred skin, and never till then did 1 know the narrow limits of human speech. The leopard, which shares with the tiger the honor of being one of India’s scourges —both in India and elsewhere, the cattle’s greatest scourge—is another nerve strainer for the hunter. Australia is the only conti- nent without some variety of this animal But. though a wicked beast, it affords little sport and, to gel a shot, one has to depend on luck as much as anything. ThisWE DISCOVERED TIGER TRACKS OX THE EW.C i>P A STREAM, AND THE BEATERS STARTED IX PURSUIT.Everybody's Magazine is because. like the tiger, the leopard has no fixed abode, no den. It has more cunning and courage than any other animal 1 have ever encountered. The tiger seldom enters a dwelling or house of any sort that is reasonably barred against him. The leopard, however, will try to force its way into any house or shed where it can detect the slightest odor of prey, and. failing to reach it. will walk up and down all night in the vicinity. Leopards are exceedingly fond of dogs, and will go to almost any extremity to get one, as the following incident shows. One night. Mortimer was in my tent writing letters, neither of us thinking an animal would come near the tent, which was well lighted with a powerful lamp. At our feet was a line Russian wolf-hound, which had accompanied Mortimer all over Africa and India. As the animal was prized greatly, it always occupied its master's tent, and on this occasion was tied to his cot. Pres- ently 1 thought I saw something pass the door, and then decided it must have l>een my imagination. A little later I looked up again and saw the two green, phosphorescent eyes of a leopard. 1 pre- tended I did not see it, and slowly sneaked my hand round fur my pistol: but the ani- mal disappeared. I jumped up and went outside. Looking everywhere, 1 could see no sign of the leopard, and was about to give up the search, when a howl of pain sounded from Mortimer’s tent, and the next instant the leopard bounded out. hold- ing the dug in its mouth as a cat holds a mouse. I.ike a flash 1 tired, missed the first shot, and got in the second and third that killed it. But the dog was dead, its back crushed by the powerful jaws. It is natural when writing of leopards to associate with them the cheetah—an animal whose natural hunting instinct lias been cultivated in India for sporting pur- poses since dark antiquity. Although the animal is plentiful in Africa, it is there only in a wild stale. And. while I have seen cheetahs used as pets by French officers in Africa and have had one myself, I have never seen them trained to hunt as they are in India. Most native princes have their cheetahs, which they use in the s[M>rt of deer coursing; many of them reserve jungles where no one is allowed to shoot, even though a man- eater may hav e made it his lair. The coursing usually takes place during the cold months, when there is little grass to hide the game, and generally the quarry is the magnificent and fleet-footed black deer. Before the cheetah is taken to the hunting grounds he is starved for twenty- four hours to make him keen, for he knows from long experience that if he brings down his prey his reward will be its blood. The cheetahs that I saw in action were the personal property of the Rajah of Pun- jab, whose keepers conducted the hunt for the benefit and edification of His Excel- lency's guests. We set out for the hunting ground with drays drawn by two oxen, each dray hold- ing one cheetah and its keeper. Some were in cages, others just chained to the dray, and in every case hoods were kept over their heads so that they would not grow excited at the approach of game. As it chanced, the first course was with a fine herd of between twenty and thirty black deer. Once they were sighted, the drays went on to get as near as possible before the game was alarmed. When they were within three hundred yards, the game bolted. In an instant the keeper slipped the hood ot? the first cheetah’s head; it sprang to the ground, hesitated a second as if picking out its prey, and then, like a rocket, the yellow form shot over the gray-green earth after a fine buck the fleetest animal, it is said, on four legs. Spurring our horses, we dashed after them in a wild ride, to be in at the kill. It was a picturesque scene—the galloping native gentlemen in their striking costumes, on their splendidly equipped chargers, galloping after the flying buck and his pur- suer. Thrice the deer doubled on its track, each time losing ground to the cheetah. It was a splendid but cruel sight to see these two beautiful creatures racing for their lives, the buck to save its own, the cheetah to maintain his, for it was the life instinct of hunger that drove him on. At last in a cloud of dust the tragedy took place. The cheetah leaped at the throat of his prey, and down came the buck in a heap. The cheetah held the poor beast's throat in a grip of iron until the keepers cut it and gave the hunter his reward. His appetite satisfied, the cheetah becomes useless—he will not hunt unless hungry; so the hood is slipped over his head and he is taken back to his cage. Cheetahs have aTracking the Man-Killer 3°3 peculiar, almost sentimental, sense, for when they fail to bring down their quarry they will run away and hide, and when caught will sulk for considerable periods, as though ashamed of their failure. Like the tiger hunt, a buffalo hunt in India is a sort of picnic to an old African hand, although dangerous enough and often fatal; for the Indian buffalo is no weakling. The Asiatic bulTalo, like the African species, makes its home in swampy country. It is generally found near large bodies of water, where it can make the wallow, so necessary to its existence. Our party hunted the Soune River, a tributary of the Ganges. There were twenty-six elephants in the shikar host, each howdah carrying its white hunters some novices, some old hands. Our first herd we found in a heavy jungle, a part of the lowland where grass grew at least fifteen feet in height. It was a good hiding place for any wild beast and, I may add, a dangerous place to hunt in. Twice I caught a fleeting glimpse of tiger, so brief a view in that tangle that I had no chance to shoot. In fact, the jungle was so thick that without elephants it would have been impossible to hunt. A man on foot could see only the cane-like grass around him and a little patch of sky above. Against a dangerous wild animal in such surroundings, he would not have the ghost of a chance. Failing to find the herd on thc east bank, we crossed the river. It was a splendid sight to see the monstrous elephants take to the water. They walked right down the bank till they were almost submerged, the shi- karees and mahouts standing upon the small patch of elephant hide that showed above the water. In this fashion the huge beasts walked, in single file, straight as an arrow flight to the bank opposite. While crossing the river an amusing inci- dent occurred. In our party was an ex- patriated American who disguised his na- tionality under the mask of an English accent. It was only on rare occasions that a slip gave him away. Among our ele- phants was one that had only recently been broken, and, following the elephant habit, it wanted to play when it got into the water. So at a moment when the English-aping American was upholding the wonderful in- telligence of the elephant to the two ladies with him. the green elephant raised it- trunk and squirted a broadside of muddy water straight into the howdah. It came with the force of a fire hydrant, and deluged the occupants. “Gol darn yer soul! " rose above the roar of laughter in a strong New England twang. When we had regained our composure, a young American in another howdah cried, “Say, old sport, the elephant washed out your accent.” We had no sooner touched the opposite bank than the mighty, spreading horns of a buffalo showed above the grass. Unfor- tunately, however, it bolted before we could get a shot. The elephants were now divided, each half to act as beaters for thc other. Thus arranged, wc had gone not more than a quarter of a mile into the grass when a rush and a grunt warned us to pre- pare for action. 1'he elephants were halted, and a moment later a rhinoceros broke cover—the unexpected again. Two of us fired and thc beast fell without a struggle. We thought that the day was to pass with- out any further incident. In the distance we could see the white helmets of the other party coming toward us above the grass. "Poor sport," I said to Mortimer. In answer came the thundering crack of a .577 express. By this time we were getting out of the long grass into shorter growth. The mahouts halted our elephants, and we waited. We could see the grass waving and hear the crashing of some huge body as it rushed through. Suddenly a huge buffalo bull, magnificent to behold, broke out of the undergrowth. Blood and froth were stream- ing from its nostrils, and its eyes were glar- ing. Without hesitation, the mighty beast, with its formidable eight-foot sweep of horn thrust forward, rushed at the line of ele- phants with a thunderous bellow. I fired, but my elephant, anticipating a light and crouching to resist the foe, threw my aim off. Then the two huge beasts met with a terrific shock. I was jerked off my feet, and it was all I could do to hold myself in the howdah as the elephant swayed. Mor- timer now came to the rescue by putting a couple of express bullets behind' the shoul- der of til.' infuriated bull. Even then it did not fall, but staggered back to make another thrust at the elephant. Blood was gushing from its mouth and the glaze was over its glaring eyes, but still it made the rush It was the last, however. The huge brute fell with a roar as it hit the bleeding side of my mount.CODFISH , , and the IDEAL (B P1X G • r U RTMER- M L MO I \\ SOFP I\ ENTICE PIP E Pi) BY WALTER PRICHARD EATON Author oJ "THE AMERICAN STAGE OP TO-DAY."

(I suppose it is commonplace to die of a broken heart, though I never knew any one who did.) But I must admit that his re- covery was speedy and thorough. Poor Prentice, with the soul of a Shelley and the outer aspect of a milk-fed Marceline. lias himself recorded the story of his lirst ro- mantic aspirations, of how Alicia turned from him to a youth who knew much less about Romance philology (and nearly every- thing else) but whose proportions were somewhat closer to those approved by aesthetic standards, and whose mind did not leap out of the road into the lanes and pas- ture- of human thought and achievement upon the slightest provocation. “I have a family-dog mind,” Prentice once said. "I 304Codfish and the Ideal go fifteen miles while the carryall is driving three." Prentice, however, always reaches his intellectual destination, with an amazing lot of wild flowers gathered by the way. But I am mixing my metaphors and for- getting my story. Prentice jjossessed be neath his fat and preposterous exterior .1 depth of romantic sentiment unguessed eve n by me. an old friend. Perhaps it was his shy way of telling me to leave behind the auto biographical record of his unfortunate at tempt at love, when he departed for Tibet and Central China. He said he went to study the routes traversed by Marco Polo and other antique travelers. Actually he went. I know, to forget Alicia, to forget that his fat body and his quaint soul had decreed that he could not “come into his garden and eat his precious fruits." Alicia was *'a gar den shut up” indeed, fur him. by all the law;, of her girlish nature. Beautiful she must have been—and quite incapable of under- standing Prentice. But what did that mat- ter if lie loved her, longed for her, wove his ardent dreams about her? When he found she loved another, he gave her up with un- questioning self-sacrifice. That is his way. Then he went to China to forget. The manuscript he left behind 1 published —disguised, of course. I know he never really' meant that 1 should, but it seemed to me too good to keep. Besides, I never dreamed he would come home in time to see it. But editors sometimes take a long while getting round to printing things, and before it had reached type Prentice was back in America and had laid another and far happier—-manuscript on my desk, li one is printed, the other ought to be. 1 won't rehearse the discussions we have had. almost fights, over the question of printing these inti	t ed, records. It is enough to slate that 1 have finally won his reluctant permission to make the second one public also. Perhaps he believes that he owes it to his fellow fat men to demonstrate that even two hundred and twenty-five pounds are not inevitably a bar to the convincing expression of a romantic temjjerament. The continuation of his "I'seless Mi moirs" he calls, characteristically. "Cod- fish and the Ideal." ***** The suburbs have always been a vice with me. So many people live there whom one never knows!

Besides, for sundry reasons 1 didn't care to meet anybody 1 know As the only spots on the Maine coast with which 1 was familiar were York Harbor and Bar Harbor. 1 got a map in Boston and did a little ciphering. I took the distance between these two points, divided it by thirteen, added that result to the distance between Boston and York, and told the conductor to tear out of my mileage book Coupons equivalent to the new total. He put me off the train, much to my satisfaction, in the heart of Suburbia, (oris with devouring glances were at the station, their lingerie waists disclosing the colored ribbons in their underclothes. 1 had al- ways wanted to meet such *;irls. I selected the hotel nearest the water and told the proprietor I desired two rooms. He looked at me in amazement. "Why the second?" he said. I, too, expressed surprise. “Why. to dump the sand in out of my shoes at night, of course." I said. I spoke in a clear, strong voice. Sub- urbia, fancy-working in the lobby, looked up with mingled curiosity and alarm A buzz followed me about the hotel.

But mostly they were writing let- ters. on lap portfolios. "I am sitting right beside the sea as 1 write this"—that, I know, is the way they all began. Now and then one ol these females would lift her eyes to remark, in her high-pitched, chairman- of-thc-lilerature-committee-of-the-woman’s- club voice: "Isn’t it lovely here? I just adore Nature!” Or else she would rise and move to a more shaded rock, with the grace- ful motion of a terrified elephant on a tight- rope. There were young women, too—the suburban man-eaters. A few had secured victims and dragged them off to a lair above the waves. Them I did not dis- turb at their repasts. Others, less for- tunate, had sought a substitute in a box of molasses kisses and a volume of George Harr McCutchcon. But I came upon odd game, too. Round- ing a huge bowlder, I nearly tripped over a small, wizened, bespectacled old gentle- man, with dandruff on his collar, reading a strange-looking book. The characters were Hebrew, lie saw my glance. "I’m reading a little Isaiah,” he said, with a friendly smile. "I like it in this setting." '“Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of hi> hand and meted out heaven with the span—T” I quoted, looking more intently at the funny little old gentleman. "Do you read Hebrew?” he asked hope- fully. I shook my head. "Only German, French. Spanish, Italian. Romance French, Anglo-Saxon, and a little Latin." I answered humbly. "They leave Hebrew to the Di- vinity School now.” Not necessarily there any longer.”sighed the little old gentleman. “There is no call in the library for Hebrew any more." “.Still.-’ said I, “to speak with that ele- gance which the subject demands, Isaiah is some pumpkins in the Knglish." The old gentleman smiled and made a place for me beside him. “Let us talk of many things," he said. 300‘•■'Sliall we begin with cabbages or kings? 1 asked.

I loved the little old gentleman. I wanted to ask him what he was doing here in summer Suburbia. But suddenly one of the large ladies under a silly sun hat lumbered round our rock, laden with pillows, fancy work, and E. Phillips Oppenheim. "John," she said, “help me up to the house!” John rose spryly and bent his five feet one to the task, like a small jack under the axle of a seven-passenger touring-car. So the suburbs can harbor an Old Grammarian! Poor man, I suppose he was thinking ab- sently of some Hebrew prophecy when she proposed to him, and assented before he realized!

I believe you are right." she said, "But nobody will buy water-colors." " W ill anybody buy oils?"askedI.cruelly. Her face betrayed an instant pain, but as quickly it was conquered. “Sometimes," she returned brightly. 1 began to like her immensely. "Do me this pool in water-colors. and I'll buy it, at your price." said I. She colored, and began to gather up her stool and brushes. "I I couldn't do that," she said in embarrassment. "You can, and you will." I replied, jump- ing down the rock to help her “Business is business, you know." “Hut you don't know my work," she ob- jected feebly. 1 had the fresh cam as in my hand. "This is enough." said 1 As a matter of fact, it was, so far as oils were concerned. It was charming. 'Well," she filially agreed, "I suppose business is business. Where shall 1 de- liver it? " "Right at the hotel," 1 answered. "I'm there, too." She smiled. "But I'm not. I'm afraid I shouldn't cure for the hotel. I live a mile tip. at Codfish Cove." "Not care for life at the hotel?" I cried. Why. wc have school teachers for cham- ermaids, and everybody in the place just e- Nature and the Merry Widow!" ’ Exactly," said -he. I [>iiked up her stool and easel. "Then it Codfish Cove.' I said and started on. She regarded me in an amused way. “ Do you actually fancy you arc going to carry my things home for me?" she asked. " No.” said I. “I'm certain of it If you don't live at the hotel you can’t deliver the picture, and if I don't know where you live I can't come after il. and besides. I'm a fat, foolish, preposterous person that nobody minds at all. After a while, you won't notice me." She accepted my escort as inevitable, and we moved along a little path through the bay bushes, just above the rocks, where we could li>ok up the coast at the white fringe of the surf to a second distant group of summer hotels and cottages. Presently the path wound over a ridge and came down to the shore of a rocky cove, where a little tide inlet made up into the meadows. Scaly dories rode at their moorings on the clear, deep water of this cove; between the rocks and the water, on a strip of shingle, was a group of gray, weathered fishermen’s houses, with nets spread out to dry in the sun. and piles of lobster pots. I noticed studio lights in two or three of the fish houses. Back at the edge of the meadow stood a comfortable old white farmhouse. She pointed to it. “That is where we artists of Codfish Cove live,” said she. “We work in the fish houses. Come, we will go to my studio." We entered the low door of the mouse- gray shed—or at least she did. 1 paused on the threshold, for from within came that coast of Maine fish odor with overpowering might. “What?" she cried gayly. "Afraid of my nice, wholesome smell? Come right in, the odor's fine." Thus challenged, I advanced. The in- side of the shed was the most delightfully incongruous place 1 had ever entered. The light came from a great window in thc north- ern end. looking out on the sweep of the coast, and then to open sea. Against one wall stood an old Mary E. Wilkins sofa with rolled ends, against the other a row of lobster pots. Thc easel, with a picture on it. was placed near the window, and the brushes stood upon an inverted fish bucket. Immediately above the sofa and the lobster pots the walls were hung with charming marines, brightly framed in gold. Aboye them jutted the low rafters, and on cross -Mips, making a ceiling tor the room, were piles of nets, the leads hanging down, broken oars, a dory, fish-lines, an anchor, and a myriad other objects dedicated to the pur- suit of the cod. My hostess now stood against the light from the north window. The blue sea. growing pink on the edgesCodfish .'ind the Ideal from the westering sun. made an aura in her hair. She was smiling, a little wistfully, a little triumphantly. “Don’t you think it is nice?" she said. I held my nose with one hand. “Now I can pronounce it unqualifi- edly delightful." 1 an- swered. “Codfish and the ideal!" "You are laughing." she said. " 1 do not per- mit people to laugh at my studio!” “Madam.” I cried. “I always laugh at every- thin". 1 cannot help it. My face works quite in- dependently of my feel- ings. I have, besides, rite role of fat man to keep up. Actually. 1 envy you everything but the odor, and 1 should be willing lo have even that and fifty pounds more weight as well if 1 could write out my ideals, my inner vis- ions, one half so success- fully as you.” She looked at megravely. “Have you never tried?” she said. Dusk was creeping into the studio. Perhaps it was that. Perhaps it was the odor going to my head. Perhaps it was the aura in her hair and the friend- liness i >i her voice. Per- haps it wa« because I had scarcely spoken to a woman of my own race for a year; you get to miss the creature.' so! Then, aguiit. perhaps it was because 1 am natur- ally more or less of a ro- mantic idiot. At any rale. I answered: “ Yes.

" .Sometimes that is -.i'Ii- i-lmess. I must close the studio now. I shall begin your picture in the morning.” "May I come to watch you work?” I asked, glad enough now to crawl thus easily out of the subject. ‘‘If you can escape the laities who just love Nature.” she smiled. ‘‘Nature has aided me to do that,'' I an- swered mournfully'. "Not when they are really hungry." she ventured. And with this she fled up the path to the farm. 1 watched her go. and then strolled slowly home, pondering her words about idealism and selfishness. And I came here to study Suburbia! . . . 1 ler name is Hattie, 1 lattie Walker! Was ever a name more preposterously prosy? Fancy its possessor following the Gleam, searching always for the ideal expression of a beauty fell in sea or sky <>r water pool, and sacrificing to the search! Yes, I am sure she has sacrificed much. She is immensely clever, and if she desired merely to live well by her brush, she could. Hut she boils the pot with the best that is in her. My water- color of the pool is a gem. It stands on my bureau, completely obliterating the glass and causing me to rut myself when I shave. How casually she took my check! Yet I detected that her lingers trembled. The Old Grammarian says it is the first picture she has sold I his summer. He’s an odd duel;, snooping round with the fishermen when he isn't reading Hebrew, and picking up gossip about the run of lobsters and the ali.iirs of the artists at the Cove. I’ve bought him one of her pictures, by the way, or ralher I took him to buy it for himself. One of the blessings of an honest poverty is thcpride it fosters. Miss Walker Would, of course. have yild me more oi her picture?, but if she had she would there- after have regarded me deferentially as a patron, but with a kind of smoldering hostility. I know these New Englanders! She would sell me her choicest work, but she would cease to give me her choicest friend- ship: and that friendship she has given me with less and less reservation as the days have passed and I have burbled beside her as she worked. So 1 sent the Old Gram- marian. When I went to get him, he was sitting on the veranda, out of the piping gale, telling a group of contemporary females about Kansas cyclones. “You know, out there in the schools,” he was saying, “they have cyclone drills in- stead of fire drills. Each teacher has a long rope with a noose at the end to put around her waist and a lot of little nooses down the length of it for the children. At the signal she adjusts her noose, throws out the rope, each child springs into a little noose, and the teacher leads the way to the cyclone cellar. It is a very interesting sight. The principle is the same as that of the Alpine climber's r< ipe." "Well, isn't that interesting!” chorused the ladies. The Old Grammarian just then spied me. "Mr. I’iper," he added, "would make an excellent teacher in Kansas.” The ladies tittered respectfully. (My two rooms have inspired a respect never before accorded to me.) 1 drew the Old Gram- marian aside. "You old reprobate," said I, "you’ve never been in Kansas. But now you are going to buy a picture from Miss Walker." I had to give him a detailed statement of my income, to explain to him exactly' why' 1 couldn't make the purchase in person, and to paint the delights of ownership in glowing colors, before I could induce him to buy the picture ior himself. He was quite ready to buy it forme, but hi- pride balked at accept- ing a gift. \\ are the people I want to help invariably the ones who won't let me? But finally I won him over. "I don't own a nally good picture,’- he said wistfully. "1 have some nice repro- diu'ims, though, and two plates from Audubon's Birds, which my wife doesn’t care for. I have hung them in my little study." We found Miss Walker in her studio. " Lady of the Cod.” I said, “I have brought you an admirer. He is enormously wealthy. Stick him good.” She looked up with her bright smile, tak- ing in the ()ld Grammarian with her glance. His faded, unpressed clothes, his clerical collar, his shoulders stooped with poringANP I BU;ssl:» Till 1IIRD FOR 1111 KINO rWL\l>- III II<a\'l - Ml.. over books the true librarian's stoop—his bespectacled eyes. ludicrously belied my words. Miss Walker looked back at me with a kind of frightened questioning. I nodded reassuringly, however, and we got out the canvases. The Old Grammarian was soon lost in the delights of contemplation. He especially loved the more delicate aspects of the sea, which Miss Walker attempts t<> capture, the overtones of that mighty organ, as it were. Warmed by his enthusiasm, h< adjusted lights, she told of the composition, her color rose. And I ^it back on the Mary ! Wilkins sofa and loved them both prbiect- ingly.

Well, well, the world h a small place after all!” This mighty truth about the world has been borne in upon me, too. The Lady of the Cod and I have a favorite apple tree in a pasture a quarter of a mile back front the coast. It i- low and aged, and from its branches wc look across the pasture to the white ribbon of road, and beyond that the rocky fields of bay bushes and then the blue plain of the sea. We sit in this tree toward sunset time, because just at that time the white sails out toward the horizon turn pink, and an old man comes into view along the curve of the road, driving two cows. Yesterday we were looking out from our Eden perch, and I was discoursing upon the needs of a civic theatre to rescue such people as my factory hands and their chil- dren from the blighting mediocrity of mov- ing picture shows or the crass vulgarity of vaudeville and burlesque, while the Lady listened with frowning brows, contributing now and then suggestions about pageants which tired both of us with enthusiasm. ■'You shall come down with me next win- ter," 1 cried, “and we’ll make a start on working this thing out. I've never done a hundredth part for those people that I should." "No, I don't believe you have," said 1 was about to answer when I suddenly -aw a runabout come around the bend of the road. It was two hundred feet away, or more, but I could not mistake the figures. I latless, in his inevitable white tlannels, Marlborough Saltonstall was at the wheel, and beside him sat Alicia. The silvery peal of her laugh drifted over the pasture to me. like an echo from the past An instant, and they were gone. 1 cannot describe the emotions w ithin me -the wakened memories of Alicia's kiss, of her flower-like beauty, of the extravagant romantic longings of my youthful heart, of my dreadful torture when her love turned cold to me and warm to Marlborough Saltonstall: and thc curious sensation, loo, of having her cut across my eager converse with this other Lady, she who had never really followed with me a serious train of thought in her life. I was stunned into silence. “What is the matter?" said a voice at my side. I turned to the speaker, as if awaking. Sin- had neve r pitied me for my preposterous exterior!—she had never seemed to recog- nize the need of pity. She had met me on the ground of common interests and made me her friend without a hint of sex. She, who worshiped beauty, had made a friend of so unlovely an object as myself, because I, too, am a worshiper, in my poor, jocund way. Again I thought of Alicia's flower face and remembered my hungry longings for her love, but following, stilling such thoughts, was the real image of this eager, grave, clear-eyed face beside me, and the memory oi all the exquisite hours of the past month, when, instead of the old emotional unrest, there has come to me the peace and pleasure of perfect comprehension and the mutual pursuit of beautiful sights and stim- ulating ideas. Even her name suddenly lost for me its preposterous prosiness. "The matter?" I answered. “The mat- ter is. Hattie, that the world is a small place, as the ladies say at the hotel.” She regarded me quietly, gravely, and waited. I think I told you." I continued, “that once I tried t*> write out my ideals in my love for a girl 1'hat was the girl." She put her hand lightly on my arm. My friend," she said, "you have a roman- lit heart. You think every one as beautiful as you want them t<> be, as tine as your own iancics You hunger for an enthusiasm and sympathy as boundless as your own, to make you happy. You won't find them. Write out your ideals in real ink and paper, ■	r in the lives of your factory hands. You will be happier so, and and nobler." She withdrew her hand. Her touch had been warm and friendly, but it had been something more to me. It had kindled nit- wit h a sudden desire to hold her shouldersCodfish and the Ideal .113 between my hands, look into her face, and read there what was really in her heart. But I did not touch her. Something held me back, something besides the danger of such a proceeding in an apple tree Per- haps it was the echo of Alicia's laugh, still drifting across the pasture. I simply said. ‘•Lady, that sympathy and that enthusiasm I think I shall find!" And 1 looked her eagerly in the eyes. She met my glance for t moment —a hushed moment charged with 1 know not what electric eloquence. Then, in silence, we descended from the tree, and in silence followed the old man and the cows up the white ribbon of the road. . . . The Lady is going to give her exhibition of her summer’s work next Saturday, and the Old Grammarian is cursing his poverty. Sometimes now he sits with us while the Lady works, reading aloud snatches from the Upanishads. Fancy his reading the Upanishads to Mrs. Grammarian! His affection for us seems to draw us closer together, as in a protecting garment. I be- lieve the sweet old soul is living vicariously in our younger friendship. To-day he delivered a little talk on Ro- manticism. apropos of some remark of mine about literary tendencies. The Lady, I noticed, quite stopped her work to listen. "Romanticism!’’ he exclaimed. ‘ In lit erature and life, through the ages, it has been a search for an escape from the bond- age of fact, from the prison of the common- place. Vet how often has it been a Phari- saical search, a selfish search; how often has romantic literature been the sigh of a dissatisfied soul. yet. paradoxically, a self- satisfied soul! Why does the prisoned soul seek an escape? Is it because he feds a 'divine unrest'? No, but because he feels that he, personally, is deserving of some- thing better. Only when the romantic im- pulse expresses itself in some word or deed of sacrifice for others is ils unrest truly di- vine. The Romantic shut up in his ivory tower is detestable, and his literature a >ham. The Romantic who forgets his own little pains to make his dreams operative for society is the one to admire. I don't mean lie must be a propagandist or a reformer, but his work must eliminate a sickly self and speak to all men. If he is a man in love. Aucassin is not his ideal, however beautiful that ideal may seem to the heart of youth; he will not be sicklied o'er with the amorous passion, but expanded ini" .i let -ynipa- thv for his fellows “Even if he is ju»t a man trying to live in the modern world, he will not lie perpetually discontented and moonstruck, but perpetu- ally trying to put his ideals before the eye- of the less fortunate souls about him e\en if he's only a poor librarian. 11 he i- a novelist. he will not be writing idiotic tales about spurious knights and ladic>or mythical king doms or imposr.il>le deeds that is not to be romantic but puerile. He will, with all the grace and charm that is in him, be writing about the real people whom he knows, and showing how their lives, however humble, are touched now and again by the Gleam. We babble too much about romance and realism. Huysmans said there are no such things, but only good literature and bad. But what is good in this world has always about it some aura of ils infancy, some golden glint of the true romantic Gleam. Which reminds me. my wife asked me to bring her this novel!” He took a volume of current fiction from under his coat, grinned sheepishly, and moved away around the rocks. "It’s a poor sermon.” said I,“ that doesn't hit somebody in the congregation.” The Lady said nothing, and I continued: “All my life I have been cherishing the de- lusion that 1 was beautilully romantic; but all my life I have, it seems, been seeking only a personal satisfaction. You told me the same thing, I believe, when "r first met. Once I loved .i girl without any t hough I but to he shut up with her in a tower for two. That love made me no more eager to help my people, no more sorry for any one less fortunate than I, no more desirous of mak- ing my ideals of sweetness and light —if I have any prevail. In fact, it made me hate my fellow-men—one of them espe- cially!” Still she wa.' silent, but she was regarding me with a kind of frightened joy, Irangc and puzzling. "I want now," I again continued, "to work out for my people in a humble way that civic theatre idea of ours. Tlu-y. as much 3S we. go to their cheap theatn ' to escape the grind of daily toil; they are obi y- ing a romantic impulse, too.

"Of course it will, the very best way! 1 know you are not selfish! 1 know you too well to think that!” ■' How do you know?” said 1. still puzzled. " I tell you. all my life 1 have been pitying myself because 1 was so fat. telling myself that I was cursed like Job. and deprived of the romantic satisfactions which come t<> the normal man and maid. I w as self-centered in my fat, sellish, egotistical way. Yet you have taken me for a friend. Wnv have you done it?" "Perhaps," she smiled again, “because / pity you. How can I help pitying any one who places such absurd emphasis on trivial externals? 1’hen. again, perhaps 1 have done it because 1 like you." " You have done it.” said I. "because you and I blissfully love the same things and don’t fail to understand. Isn't that so?” " rhcn. if it is," said she suddenly, “let us stop this silly talk and think about that mother-of-pearl light out on the horizon.” “Let us think." I answered, “about your exhibition next Saturday'.” •' I think nf little else when 1 am alone,” she answered, with a look of pain. "It means everything to me." So our lecture on romance ended in prac- tical figuring—where most romances end! . It was in the sudden sweetness of pity- so much sweeter a thing than the sensation of being pitied that full realiza- tion came to me of my love for the Lady of the Cod. 1 knew that the <)ld Grammarian was right, and I knew that 1 had found my true romance at last.

My first desire was to crown my I..tily’s exhibition v.-ith success; my second i tell her of niy love, to learn whether for it, too, our friendship had become that •rofounder mystery of the heart. There wasn’t a soul at the hotel whom I could enlist as a purchaser at the exhi- bition except the Old Grammarian. So I had. after all. to make the hateful trip to the Harbor, among the folks I know. I found Jack Hollis there Better still, I found his sister. I found my father's old partner, too —a kindly, if tight-listed, lover of the arts, and stayed to tea in order to get his promise to drive up to the exhibition—and to buy. There were three. Then, finally, 1 rounded up Billie Barton, who has become a grist mill of "best sellers" since he used to write pale pink imitations of Pater, in college. Now he lives at expensive summer resorts, wears socks to match his ties, and pretends he admires his own books. If he keeps it up much longer, he'll end by really admiring them! I told him so. Well, they all descended on the studio in a body. The Lady was staggered for a moment by the prospect of real purchasers. Those segments of Suburbia which were present retired to a corner before the rustle of Miss Hollis's clothes, to observe her rather than the pictures, and Billie Barton actually forgot he was a "best seller" and became once more the old, appreciative Billie, sensitive to the real thing. Bless him, he bought two pictures! Jack Hollis wanted one of the golf links, but, failing that, he took a bit of sea which showed a yawl—wrongly rigged, he com- plained. but still recognizable. His sister met the Lady with that beautiful friendli- ness which she knows so well how to cast like a spell over those whom she would set up beside herself. She is the truest patri- cian I have ever known. The Lady, happy and rosy under this spell, expanded shyly. Father’s old partner watched her anil me, 1 could detect, quite as much as the paint- ings, and grinned amicably. But he had been watching the pictures, too. As we were about to depart, he put his hand on the gem of the lot—a strip ot shingle with a phantom dory riding in the fog. "This goes to our Museum at home." he said. The Ladv gave a happy little gasp. Miss Hollis smiled. 1 cried. "That’s the ticket' And you’ve got the best of them all!" "Young man," -aid father’s partner, "I am well aware of that. I trust it will rc produce in the catalogue-." And 1 blessed the Lord for the kind friends He has given me. When my guests had departed, under the peering eyes of Suburbia on the hotel ve- randa, I hastened back to the fish house. On the way I met the Old Grammarian, coming along the path under the cliff with his vicarious purchases hugged under his arm. 1 have left her almost happy," he said. “Why not quite?" I asked.Codfish and the Ideal 315 J'hat is for you to do," replied the Old Grammarian. Hut 1 was not angry with him. 1 sped with renewed vigor along the trail. Again the light wa> low and pink on Ihe sea. and my Lady of the Cod stood alone against the northern window, an aura in her hair. She came forward with her hand out- stretched. “How am I ever to thank you fur this?" she said. “You have enabled me to go tin; you have been my fairy god- father. I fully expect you to drive off in .1 pumpkin coach!” I held her hand in mine. That lifelong romantic hunger of my heart for an exalted emotional excitement, a thrilling happiness, which should burn steadily and bright, was satisfied anew, but satisfied in a manner I had never dreamed. There may be a bloom and a glory about romantic first love which never comes again, but there is a glory about our later love, our love based upon a mutual recognition and understanding of each oth- er’s wider interests and desires, which has its graver and its sweeter charm. There i> no fear of the future in it. The years stretch ahead in a vista of ever truer happi- ness and comprehension. “Dear Lady of the Cod,” I said, "I am ugly and fat.

"From the moment," she answered, “that I knew some one else hadn't.” "Hut I told you that when we met!” I cried. With a little laugh she crept closer in tin- dusk of the studio, and slowly the beautiiul pictures in their frames, her visions of the loveliness in sea pool or fog-swept shore, her contributions to the romantic glamour of I In- world. melted together with the lobster pots into an indistinguishable blur. Hut the heart where these visions were warmed life was beating against my own.STEEL RAILS ana IRON HANDS fry Richard Washburn Child SditOTt Note- What do you know about the railway problem? Do you realize that it i liters into your east oj living, no matter who you arc or what your occupation!' Do you reali.c that your food, your clothing, your furniture, everything in your house, everything that you buy, pays toll to the railroad, at least once, perhaps many times.'’ Here is an article that presents the whole railroad situation simply, sanely, without prejudice, and corrects many loose statements and fallacious impressions that so far have cumbered the issue. The railroad problem is your problem. Its final solution will be for you tv find. Here are the facts on which vou can base your consideration and your conclusions. RAILWAY regulation is not a senti- mental question. It ha' been made to appear so. It has been made sentimental by half a generation of ill-advised accusation and a defense on the part of the railroads that seemed like perfume used to conceal an odor. the attack has been so senseless, the defense so sensitive, that the ordinary man hardly knows what to think. He cannot confidently advise hi' representative in government what to do. His opinion is no opinion .it all. It i? an impression. It is a feeling in the bones. Before these articles were written, two hundred men of various stations in life laborers, clerks, lawyers, doctors, mer- chants. government employees—were asked casually their opinion about American rail- way rates. A composite of their answers, which were jotted down, is about this: ‘Stock-watering and manipulation have been paid tor bv the public through high late? \Yi are gouged- you and I. Rates should be lower. Government ownership wouldn’t work. 1 guess. I don’t know much about the question, now that you ask things in detail. But it is robbery; the people will finally get on to it and stop it. You can tell it is robbery by the way these railroad presidents and big financiers act—you can sec they don’t want the truth known. We need more legislation to lower rates. Cut ’em in half.” The tragedy about this is that the voice is the voice of the court of last resort. Who will settle the railroad question? Not Wall Street. Not Mr Morgan or other financiers. Not railway presidents. Not investors. Not employees. Not politi- cians. Not newspapers owned or corrupted by the "interests.” Not shippers. The court of last resort is composed of the men and women for whom this page was w ritten, edited, set up. printed, and sent out across the country. The man who settles the problems of railroad transportation will be the man who finally pays for railroad transportation, the man who wants the service and pays for it. This man in his home can see in the price 3«<>Steel Rails anil Iron Han-is .>'7 paid fur rocking-chair, knives and forks, curtains, rugs, water faucet, necktie, closet door, poker and tongs, overcoat, rubber boots, ilour and saleratus. the wall paper, the evening lump, and the family Bible, a percentage due to the cost of transporta- tion. Let him look around the house for an article that has not traveled on a railroad. Most of these articles, their parts, or mate- rials from which they are made, have traveled on railroads not only' once, but many times. The charge for transportation each’ time has been added into the final price. It is there. The consumers have paid the promoter, the financier, the salary of the railway president and officers, the employees, the railway supply houses, the investors, the bills rendered by the rail- roads to the shipper*. Collectively, they have paid the whole bill. Xot as a matter of sentiment, but as a matter of business: not as a matter of specu- lation. but as a matter of fact, it is the con- sumers who must say the last word about the railroads. You can talk of the rights of property till Doomsday; you can say that the setting of the interests of mankind above the rights of property is Socialism, or anarchy, or arson, or Christianity, or altru- ism. or twaddle, or you can talk of public utilities and constitutional limitations and reasonable rates and commissions until chaos; the truth is this nil; RAILROADS AND TUI KAM1I.V IIOKS1. It is a nation of consumers who say' the last word on service and rates, not for any other reason than t hat they can do it That eliminates any sentimental or learned or doctrinal notions at the beginning of the subject. That is the business of the situa- tion. They can do it. Theirs are the little iron hands. This is a good notion—it is the only air- clearing notion to begin with in dealing with the railroad question, which is not only a question of rates, but—for goodness sake, let us remember a question of service as well. Service! Something we want done! When a man finds il hard to pick out an article in his home or office that did not come to him over a railroad, it is evident that railroads have had some place in the advance of civilization. It almost seems as it they are civilization. And yet this fact is something that every one i' every moment forgetting, just as the virtue- *>t the old family horse are forgotten. The service of the railroads i- forgot t- n m*-.«t thoroughly when the cost t«. the nation i maintaining them is up for discussion, just as the faithful performance of the family horse is most thoroughly forgotten when it is remembered that he burdens us with last month’s bill for hay and grain. Human nature is just like that. It pops up with its sudden heat. It becomes forgetful, un- thinking. impatient, and cosily to itself. Till. COI.O-nUStNKKS-Ot-llll.-ITtlNV. Iii going at the regulation of railways from any side, it is blind, vicious, savage. The thing that corrects it is the cold business of the thing, which is not blind, vicious. n>>r savage, but knocks quietly on the door while the fuss is going on, knocks on the door when the fuss is over and broken crockery and furniture are strewn about the house, and knocks on the door when agitators are out of breath and corporation officials are through with their devices. In order to save trouble on both sides, we might as well open the door and let the persistent thing in now to save expense, wasted emotion, sentiment gone off the handle, and the knuckles of the cold-busi- ness-of-lhe-thing that are knocking on the door. The story of the railroads in the I'nited States is astonishing.

('■ >ld business sense says so. And it is not necessary to work up any sentimental gratitude toward the railroads. Cold busi- ness sense, having said to the common citi- zen, "The regulation of railways is in your iittle iron hands," now says: “The first : !iing you want is service." It is true. Tlir. HEART OF THE RA1I.WAY PROBLEM Nevertheless, the court of last resort, which may change even the Constitution a’ it wishes, has at least one limitation of i s authority. It is constantly forgetting it, trying to override it, neglecting it. This limitation is the characteristic of physical matter. Physical matter will not move in- telligently for the benefit of man, by itself. Mankind must move it. We may have it moved for us only in one of two ways: Wi can have the government move it, or induce private parties to move it in exchange for a reward. We must have it moved. IIY should like il mated safely, quickly. /><<- -and at lltc least possible expense. That last sentence 1- the heart of the railroad problem. Now what has been the experience of other nations with the railroad problem? Comparison* between railroad conditions at home and abroad are the chief delight of academic investigators. The comparison of impressions and reports and volumes and statistics anil figures proves anything, can prove anything, and has been made to prove anything. Agitators for government ownership and rates cut in halves—and quarters—make the case look one way; railroads, “corporation men,” and finan- ciers can make the whole thing change its color, skin, stripes, and spots. Men con- jure with ligures showing the cost of a ton mile of freight in one place and the other. These are empty figures. It is like this. Here is a sample. The average per ton mile rate is in Tlii- United States, .7(1 cents; Germany, 1.36 cents. But in this country the expensive traffic is taken away from the railroads by the pri- vate car lines and express companies, which charge exorbitant rates. In Germany there is a parcels post, and mail is carried free. YES, BUT— Yes, but railroad materials are cheaper in Germany. Yes, but in Germany bulky commodities yielding a cheap rate are carried by water. Yes, but in the United States the gradi- ents make investment and operation cost higher. Yes. but in the United States the per ton mile figure is deceptive because it includes the free carriage of goods for the companies themselves. Yes, but in Germany wages are lower. Yes, but the average haul in Germany is 7S miles; in the United States .'44. The shorter haul is more expensive. There is no end to this. When you have gone far enough with it, the best guess seems to be that, figuring everything in, the averagt freight charge in Germany is just about what it is in the United States. The matter of freight rate is secondary, anyhow. What about servicef What about national development? You comparisons are more difficult! The facts tv. make them have never been gathered. Having found out about what each country pays, you now lack any defi- nite notion of what each country gets. That is the sample. Yet perhaps it is worth while to summarize the investigations abroad:Steel Rails and Iron Hands England: Shockingly high capitalix-ation per mile. No end of fraud and scandal in purchase of right' of way by manager*- in collusion with owners of purchased prop- erty. Rales far higher than ours. Dis- crimination and rebates. Legislation un- successful and expensive. Periodical, stupid agitation. A garden spot for exposures. \ situation a thousand times worse than ours, except os to safety. Belgium: State ownership. Rates about the same as here on freight. Extremely low on passengers. Clean record as to fraud and favoritism. Pay a fair return on cost. A situation better than ours and probably best of all. but, of course, our own problem is different. It is vastly larger and vastly more complicated. Our Illness for government administration is not so well developed. Russia: Largely government ownership. Fraud. General public deprived of bene- fits. Still a part of a despotism. Italy: Government ownership failed. There were political frauds and rows. Sold out to private interests. A subsequent history of poor service, agitation, discrim- ination. Then four or live years ago the gov- ernment, under pressure of public opinion, bought back, even though expecting to suffer a deficit on operation. History worse than our own. Switzerland: Government ownership be- gan in 100,5, after a decade of agitation. Comparison as to service and rates diffi- cult, owing to light density of traffic and mountainous territory. Kates much higher than ours. Austria: Part government ownership Paternalistic management, i <■ . passenger rates made to encourage people to travel, go to school, live in the suburbs, etc. Own- ership was sold out to private management in 1S40 and bought back in part in 1S77 and since. Zone system of passenger rates. Comparison of freight rates with our own is difficult. Thai, is enough. The bald truth of the matter is this as to service, rates, and development of our resources by the rail- roads. and excluding the important matter of safety to life and limb, we, in the United States, are no less fortunate than the aver- age of other countries. Let us say all the good things first I here are more of these satisfying facts not to be denied. Die lirst i> that the percentage of the cost of living, including savings >.hkh the average consumer can charge up t- tr.-.ns- portation is surprisingly low. It averages about seven per cent. ol the total. It is true that each family has been paying niut h more in these days than ten year* ago i<t transportation; but, as we have seen already, the population, composed of many fam- ilies, is receiving a much larger service I he average person, as a member of the average family, pays a larger freight bill every year, because, as a fact, he is telling more freight. The consumption of commodities per per- son is larger, and one way of knowing this is that the railroads carry more freight per capita—an interesting consideration apart from the railroad problem, because it helps to explain the high cost of liv ing. INCREASE IN RATES IIASN’I UL'CH TO 1X1 WITH THE COST OF LIVING Then ii follows, if one cares to figure carefully, that before the cost of living is raised one hundredth from a direct effect of freight rates, these rates must be ad- vanced over ten |>er cent. Considering the service rendered to the nation, the change in average rates per ton mile is not very shocking, in spite of the general impression to the contrary. Espe- cially is this true when compared with the upward course of prices of everything else, and the rapid increase of cost of liv ing and the decreasing value of a dollar. These are the rate per ton mile statistics: 1S70. iSS; iJvjj (897 iS<j.» Then .1 rise UjOl 0)04 Then a fall: 11)0'* 100; ii>oX l<)00 It is to l>c remembered, however, that rate per ton mile statistics cannot be used with any assurance. A variety <>f influences makes them deceptive. Yet they ir< indic- ative of truth. Then another fact must be recognized. I .<>!) lO.i .So •TV ccntsI'-very body's Magazine There may be watered -t.uk in American railroads. I hat i~. then- may lie capitali- zation which does nut represent an invest- ment of money. 11 is hard l<> think of an easier thin." to make people believe than that railroads are all water. But this is not a sentimental question. Cold business sense will knock on the door until every- body i' ready to admit that, though the history is thoroughly bad, there is some bright light as to the present capitalization of our railroads. NOT SO Ml <11 WATl-.K IN RAILROADS NOW To begin with, the total capitalization carried by our operating roads averages S50.296 a mile. Now, though many other countries show better construction, which makes the cost per mile higher, we show better equipment. Then, of course, density ■	•f traffic has much to do with capitalization per mile. Thc density of our traffic is greater than that in France, less than that in England and Germany. The greater the density of traffic, of course the larger the proper capitalization will be, because in- crease in density means more stations, doubling of tracks, more equipment, more expense to insure safety of travel. Bear- ing these considerations in mind, just see- the approximate capitalization per mile in other countries in iq06, 1007, or 100S: (ire.it Britain l.iuLi.'l (alov France (iermsny Austria Russia licLrium $21*7,000 .<20,000 ijS.oco 97,000 70.00c 150,000 Furthermore, though there i> some differ- ence in opinion, the least prejudiced ex- perts believe that we could not dupli- cate our railroads for u price less than $-■1,000 a mile -the present capitalized value. Note well, however, that present value has nothing to do with the actual amount invested in railroad property. And do not make the common mistake, into which many fall, of thinking that our capi- talization is evenly distributed among the railroad... We are just beginning to learn that each railroad must be judged by it- self. Some are capitalized away beyond righteousness and earn dividends on that capitalization; some occupy defensible posi- tions. It is folly for both kinds to set up the same kind of wail against regulation, or even against agitation. Il is ridiculous that they should join in presenting a single front , it is equal folly for the public to for- get the difference in their worthiness as public servants. Finally, it must be remembered that some of the roads which have carried the most water have for long periods failed to yield dividends, and that, since the worst days of stock watering, receiverships and reorgani- zations have squeezed much of the water out—not at the e.\j>ense of the public, but at the expense of the security holders. It i- true that vast fortunes have been made by crooked financial manipulation of Amer- ican roads, but the very worst examples are ancient history and, because the investors sometimes bore the loss, the consequence of the exploitation does not rest so heavily upon the consumer the man for whom this article is written. The burden of capital- i	.ition is not so heavy to-day as it would be if, the railroads being annihilated, any one government or private interests—should try to refurnish the country with trans- portation service. These facts are sensational enough, for. instead of showing that the situation, na- tionally, is wholly bad, they show a much more surprising truth, which is that it i> not wholly bad. The consumer might as well recognize this, and do it now. It is one o| the necessities for intelligent regulation. Ill]	MOV I'. TO KAISi RATES Let us. then, get down to a simple consid- eration 0/ our railroad problem. There is no belter way to approach the subject than to seize the most timely question for analysis. Flic consumer may become fa- miliar with the ground over which he must travel 1.> reach a conclusion by looking at a minor matter that confronts him at the moment. This minor matter is the present move of r.clroad- to imrrasi■ their rates. The im- portance of a general advance in freight rates is enough to awaken the consumer to a lively interest in a matter which is his concern and in which his voice, till now. has been silent, while voices of financiers, rail- roads, and shippers have been raised in a hubbub of rather crude, evasive, and selfish controversy, which has enveloped the wholeSteel Rails and Iron Hands contention in an impenetrable cloud of eye- blinding dust, both inside and on/side the official hearings. MORE SERVICE—MORE MONEY There never has been a more important railroad question than that which was raised by this battle-front of railroads asking for an advance in rates. It is only an opening skirmish. Never has the Interstate Com- merce Commission had to realize more keenly that the question of what is a reason- able schedule of rates is a question which it cannot really answer. The perplexities of the situation are increased by what may be fairly termed an absolute failure on the part of shippers and railroads to meet any- where on a common issue where the welfare of the consumer would be considered. It is necessary for any one who wants to make an educated guess about the merits of the railroads’ demand, from the consumer’s point of view, to go outside the record of the proceedings for light. The case of the railroads is based on these assertions, and we may comment upon them as we go along: 1.	There is a necessity to raise more money for improvements and extensions and to give the country the service that it m-eds. Cold business sense admits this. The transportation facilities are inadequate. We want, need, demand, and must have servicc. INCREASED RATES VS. GILT ON THE CEILING 2.	Many of these improvements and ex- tensions are of such a nature that the benefit of them in large part goes to the public and does not add to the earning power of rail- road property. ,That is, new capital for rail- roads sees railroad property being purchased or built which docs not promise profits from its use. Therefore, they say, there arises a situation in which the whole property earns less proportionately. Cold business sense admits this, too. with qualifications. There is some virtue in the suggestion that rates should be high enough to give a fair return of profit and also pay, at least in part, for non-earning additions, which benefit the public more than they do the railroads. The traveler on American lines can see plenty of examples of property w hich is non-earning. "Look at that man putting new gilt on the ceiling of this waiting-room,” said a commuter. "I pay for that. The road wants to raise its rates and take the cost of the job out of me.” “Surely,” said his companion, who knew a little more about corporation management. " You're the man that wants it there. Gilt ceilings and big terminal stations, beauti- fully designed by high-priced architects, and lots of other things that you have been hol- lering for in recent years, are expenditures that do you more good than the stockhold- ers. You would be astounded to know how- large such non-earning improvements have become. It is the demand for non-earning improvements that makes investments in railways less attractive than they were and makes financing more difficult." BII.1.ING TIIE PAST TO THE PRESENT CONSUMER Cold business sense winces a lit tie. To be sure, this sounds plausible. Yet the trou- ble—and a great difficulty it is— lies in the exaggeration given to the fact by the testi- mony of the railroads. Any business wan knows that parts of his investment arc non-earning. Some non- earning investment is a normal incident of all business. A mahogany desk in your office earns no more than one of oak. When the railway presidents this Sep- tember tried to point out on the witness stand the need of higher rates to attract capital so that they might make addi- tions, or to yield enough to help provide for non-earning improvements out of cur- rent earnings, the business man asked, “W'hat are these new non-earning im- provements?'’ “Oh, safety devices," said the presi- dents, "and heavier track and faster service, and abolishment of grade crossings and ex- pensive terminals, and-” Here cold business sense interrupted to say that to a considerable extent these mat ters of furnishing safety, convenience, and inducements to customers are perfectly nor- mal incidents of business, and that if the railroads find themselves behind in these things, it shows a laxity in American rail- roading in the past which cannot properly be billed to the consumer to-day. And yetEverybody’s Magazine there is no doubt at all that the non-earning property of railroads is growing proportion- ately larger. 3. "Our o|>craling expense has in- creased," say the railroads. "But so has your revenue,” says cold business sense. "So has the density of your traffic. That helps you. Then again how easy it is for you, in spite of the ac- counting system provided, to show your profits are less! Listen! We know the trick: You can do it by making heavy charges to your maintenance figures, which are a part of your operating expense. You can make expense show large. That means that you are investing your profits in your own property. How can you show that this maintenance is not a process of con- cealing profits or taking them in a different form than dividends?” JUGGLING THK ACCOUNTS "Oh, we would not do anything of that sort." say the railroads. “Especially as to our accounting." "Wouldn't, eh?” says cold business sense. “Let me show you this exhibit."

File 12.54. Mr. A. II. Smith, N ice President d* General Manager. Dear Sir: Referring to our conversation in regard to the March quarter: Mr. Place advises me that it would be il- logical, although perhaps not illegal, to carry any portion of the extra Lake Shore dividend over into the second quarter. I have, however, recommended to Mr. Carstenscn a charge to the March operating expenses of $275,683, to cover the value, less salvage, of the 35 locomo- tives which have been condemned; and a charge of 8622,538.50 for rails and ties, to cover one quarter of the estimated expenditure during the year, instead of $240,000, which is one tenth. 1 have also asked Mr. Carstenscn to see that the March figures are withheld until he has had a chance to confer with Mr. Brown. Yours truly, (Sgd.) R. A. White, General Auditor. Boston and Albany Railroad (By Messenger.) At Boston, April 28, iqio. My dear Mr. Whitk: Thank you very much for your favor of the 27th inst., File 1234, advising that Mr. Place stated "it would be illogical, although perhaps not illegal, to carry any portion of the extra Lake Shore dividend over into the second quarter.” If it is illogical to spread credits it should also be illogical to spread debits over one quarter, two quarters, or 12 months. My only interest, of course, is the effect that it may have upon matters that arc now being considered. Believe me, Very truly yours, (Sgd.) A. H. Smith. Mr. R. A. White. General Auditor. File IS34.	April 29, 1910. Mr. A. H. Smith. V ice President fir General Manager. My dear Mr. Smith: Replying to yours of the 28th, in regard to spreading debits. You arc quite correct, that it is illogical and also illegal to spread debits over a period, with the single exception of such general classes of work (such as renewals or rails or ties) as would logically be continued through a series of months and the benefit of which is applicable to a year. In view- of Mr. Place's decision, the Lake Shore dividend was not carried into the suc- ceeding quarter, but 1 have authority from Mr. Carstenscn to change our plan of renew ing rails and tics so as to spread it over the entire year, which means that the March quarter will in- clude one quarter, instead of one tenth, of the entire amount: and also to include in the March expenses the figures reported by you covering condemned locomotives. This will increase the expenses for March between $650,000 and $700,000. Yours very truly, (Sgd.) R. A. White, General Auditor. If this little departure from the regular practice of the New York Central account- ing had not been made, because of “the effect it may have upon matters that areSteel Rails and Iron Hands 323 now being considered,” the New York Cen- tral would have shown an increase in oper- ating revenue for the three months ending March, 1910, of $447,794-7*, instead of a decrease in revenue. It may be mentioned that this ‘'painted” decrease, whatever reasons were back of the manipulation, not only had the effect of making the public and shippers believe in the railroad’s distress, but helped to con- vince wage earners that, in order to have better wages, they must help the railroads in an advance of rates. It is not unfair to say that the laborers are taken in by this species of strategy—these doctored statis- tics— which tend to show that a road is in distress. “And now,” says cold business sense, "it seems to me that recently the charges to maintenance all along the line have jumped. It is a curious thing, in a way—this leaping of railway maintenance out of its skin. In- stead of seeing properties that are really impoverished, I see a good many that have increased their earning capacity and have done so by charging to maintenance money which was yielded by the present rates, which came from the public. In a sen- tence,” concludes cold business sensr: TIIE railroads' concealed profits "Sonic 0/ you have been spending, out of money yielded by present rates, amounts uhich have increased much faster than the prices 0/ labor and materials or the degree of thoroughness of repair. A good deal of this money goes to the railroad interest just as much as it does when it goes in dividends, ft is a part of the profits of the business when a new piece of earning property is added to the total of earning property. And this profit cot lies out of rates.” Let us look at the Chicago, Hurlington & Quincy. In 1905 maintenance of struc- tures, way, and equipment was $18,878,692. In 1908—the year of depression, too—it had gone to $27,104,936. The first three- fourths of a year, or nine months ending April 1, 1010, showed $22,827,305! This course of expenditure on main- tenance helps to explain why some of our roads can make a poor showing to the pub- lic by talking about what is left after "oper- ating expense” has been deducted from revenues. Nothing can be plainer than that a road can make reports which serve to conceal the true state of earning power. And it is a fact that just now these charges to maintenance are aviating. IIOW THE PUBLIC PAYS THE PIPER What do the railroads say? They say that mileage has increased, so that upkeep must be larger. The answer is that it has not increased in any such proportion. They say that thoroughness of upkeep has been enforced as it has not been before. The answer is that current upkeep is a part of that revenue which any fair-minded person wants the railroads to have, over and above a fair and liberal return, with depreciation reserve thrown in; but the (light in these charges can hardly be called necessary for current upkeep when, in the recent past, good current upkeep has not been so ex- travagantly phrased in terms of dollars. They say, as to operating expense, that in good and profitable years the property should be so strengthened that dividends can be maintained in bad years. The an- swer to this is that no man of business sense will deny the railroads that right so long as the privilege is not extended beyond reason. The complete answer to any attempt to justify excessive maintenance charges is that excessive maintenance charge, or any excessive operating expense, means money that comes out of the public and goes more or less directly to the owners, or more often to the manipulators. Sooner or later, di- rectly or indirectly, the increased value of the property is capitalized. Then what? Then the public must pay rates that will yield a return on this increased capitaliza- tion, which really is the investment of the public. It was out of the earnings yielded by the public that the investment was made. HIGHER WAGES—HIGHER RATES, SAY THE RAILROADS This is the first, foremost, and most im- portant of the concealed profits of the rail- roads. It is so simple that a child can work it. It makes ridiculous any figures of rail- road prolit that are based merely on dividends paid. But suppose, for the moment, that the railways have been earning only a lair profit, or at least one which encouraged them to keep 011 in business and apparently was large enough to attract new capital.3-4 Everybody’s Magazine What is the principal basis for asking an increase in rates to maintain that fair profit because operating expense has increased? Wages. It is true that in five years wages paid by our railroads per average employee have increased fifteen per cent, or more. It is probably true that, for the increased amount, less hours of work per laborer arc received. It is true that forty-two per cent, of the gross revenue of railroads is paid out in wages. It is true that consid- erable increases have just been granted or are under advisement. But the introduc- tion of labor-saving machinery has saved some wage expense, surely. For example, the Rock Island’s report for 190S shows 3,300 tons of bridge steel placcd by the use of a bridge-erecting car at a saving in cost of about sixty per cent. RAILWAY LABOR PLAYING CAT’S-PAW Then, when the total wages and salaries paid are compared with the total operating income, there docs not seem to be any ex- traordinary change in the status. It looks like this: Per Cent, of Income Paid in Wages. 1804................................42% 1S9S....... ................. ...... 40% ..... ...........................$9% I'VOj................................40% >9®9.............................4*% Under these figures there is no need for any such excitement about increase in wages paid, for it follows that if wages have increased, there must be fewer employees in proportion to the dollars of business done. It is hard, then, to sec why railway labor- ers should become very much excited in joining with their employers to ask for a rate increase, as the only way to obtain higher wages. When they do so, they for- get that in the past wage increases did not depend upon rate advances. This was well brought out in the cross-examination of President McCrea of the Pennsylvania. The truth of the matter is t hat railway labor has, in the past few months, when it has advo- cated rate advances, played a title role in the old, old comedy of cat’s-paw. And yet, when all is said and done, the advances in wages must be reckoned with. So must the question of advance in the cost of materials. The advance in cost of materials was a large phrase with which the railroads ad- vanced to the fray. It faded considerably as time went on. Cost of railroad materials is not increasing so very fast. In fact, when the federal arbitration board was sitting to adjust the wages of locomotive firemen last June, they were presented with a list of sixty-two raw materials, tools, and basic supplies w'ith prices in 1906 compared with prices in 1909. There were forty-four de- creases in prices and ten increases. Here is another list of four of the most important railroad materials, with comparative price figures: Bitumln- Steel Rails	Lumber out Coal Pool Pig Iron Arbitrary Per Ton Price*	Unit 1905	$2.60 $28.03 SiSS8 127-7 190	6---- 2.75 28.00 17.78 140.1 1907	. 2.80 28.00 21.06 >46.9 190S---- 2.70 2S.00 15.72 133.1 1909.... 2.60 28.00 16.13 Under the circumstances it may be better for the railways to rest their case on other grounds. There are other matters to consider, too. What of the new conditions of doing busi- ness which tend to reduce cost of service? And what has been the effect of the in- creased density of traffic? The last few years have seen cheaper methods of handling freight. This saves money. Longer trains. Ten years ago the aver- age train carried about 240 tons, now it carries nearly 390 tons. Longer haul. Ten years ago the average haul was 130 miles, now it is iso. Easier grades. Larger cars. Increased density of traffic. WHY NOT BE FRANK? The trouble with the general case of the railroads was principally a trouble in prov- ing the facts and their significance. Acting together, they asserted a heavier operating expense as a need for higher rates. This case, with the exception of its application to some of the Southern roads, was not such as to convince the court of last resort. It would have been a much better case if it had argued outright for a more liberal re- turn to railroad investment. That kind of a case is frank and open. When the public knows the facts about the real return to rail-Steel Rails and Iron Hands road capital and what standard of man- efficicncy goes into the business, the mad with a good case lias nothin" to fear in asking for adequate rates. It is to the interest of the consumers—those with the little iron hands—to keep the railroads in sound health, not as a matter of sentimental gratitude, but as a matter of cold, selfish business sense, which realizes the need of service, more service, better service, plenty of it.

HOLDING THI. I.lit tlN 1 111 IM OKM A I lo.\ |M >T Unfortunately, not only as regards the case itself, but as regards its presentation inside and outside of the Interstate Com- merce Commission hearings, the railroads made a wretched exhibition. Their lawyers, as a whole, were constantly in the attitude of holding the cover on the information pot. Which, by the way. is the trouble with a lot of these lawyers representing semi-public corporations. There was a tendency on t In- part of the railroads to put witnesses on the stand who could not answer from their own knowledge as to vital matters. And when individuals who did know came along, they showed a reluctance to treat the situation in a man's way. Some of the shippers’ testi- mony was rabid and unfair. Mr. McCrea.of the Pennsylvania,seemed to hang back in answering questions which brought out the fact that Pennsylvania stockholders, "most of whom are women." have received in a year six per cent, in dividends and eight dollars a share in rights during a period in which two and one hall per cent, went to the surplus. He did not seem pleased to say that the past year was the most lucrative for stockholders of any year in the past ten except 1901. .Mr. Daly, vice president in charge of traffic on the New York Central, said he could not tell what surplus his road had last year, and that he could not tell whether there was any surplus! The auditor of disbursements for the New York Central had an estimate of the wage increase on his road, which was §4,590,647. It was pointed out that this did not show the increase in wages of men employed in freight business, but included the increase in wages paid men in passenger service. At a suggestion that the railroad furnish figures indicating the distribution between the two kinds, the attorney for the road objected \ igorously. President Truesdale, ol the Lackawanna, testified that in ten years his company lost about one million a year on operation of the Morris & Essex, which is leased to I he Lackawanna, while fifteen millions were spent 011 the leased road. The fact was later brought out that in the telling of this "loss." it was not explained that the "loss" <>n operation was calculated after seven |»er cent, interest had been paid on nearly thirty-two millions of stock and bonds of the Morris & Essex. This was a typical case of the other half of the truth—under the hat. Incidentally, the New York Cen- tral in five years has paid out over four millions for the pleasure it takes in operat ing the Boston & Albany. The railroad men who testified to the in- creased return demanded by investors in railway securities, knew very well that in- creased return is demanded all along the line—in municipal Ixmds, in industrial se- curities. Their bonds have shrunk in value no more than other I Minds. They knew it. HOW Allot'r KAI1.KOAH l.l iu II NCV? These examples are not given to add sore- ness to the subject, but to indicate that the consumer the man who is destined to have the final say cannot yet open his mouth and shut his eyes to receive wisdom. Nor has this consumer, in fact this for the benefit of railroad officials and financiers read without a smile items in the newspapers about how Mr. So-and-so. the "European financier'' (who. we find, used to be a rail- way publicity man!) says that foreign in- vestors distrust our railway securities be- cause they fear a rate advance will not be allowed. Our ordinary suburbanite with a derby hat. and our ordinary farmer who wears a collar, heard the cry of the railroad interests that railway securities held by widows anti orphans and sav ings banks are threatened. But such people knew—of course they knew—that this suggestion was a hundred times more hurtful to the integrity of the "jK-ople's savings" than any rate regulation! They knew that if there came326 Everybody’s Magazine any depression in railway securities, it could be charged, not to the alleged cause of the wail, but to the pessimistic wail itself. There were two reasons, then, against the general advance in rates proposed—and a third. The first reason was that, with a few ex- ceptions, the roads failed to show that their real profits had been reduced by new con- ditions. It must be remembered that profits are not only in the shape of dividends but also in the shape of: i. Rights to sub- scribe to stock at a figure less than the open market will pay. Abnormal increase of undistributed funds. The railroads are now enjoying the largest surplus ever stored up. 3.	Charges to maintenance, or any oper- ating expense which exceeds an amount necessary for good, honest current upkeep of the road. The second reason is that there is a good old doctrine of equity that the plaintiff must have clean hands. Somehow it seems as if the railroads have come to court this time with gloves on. The third reason is the best of all. It is constructive. To Mr. Louis D. Brandeis, who as counsel represented eastern shippers, must be credited the suggestion and the testimony drawn from railroad men them- selves that gave the suggestion nourish- ment. The suggestion is this. It is quickly said and frill-less: “You say this first step in the advance of rates you plan is a small increase, a small burden on the consumer and a small offset to your ‘enlarged’ operating expense. But a small decrease in your operating expense would meet the situation just as well. Why don’t you try efficiency?" Mr. Brandeis showed by his cross-exam- ination that scientific business efficiency practiced in competitive industrial enter- prises was something of a stranger to most railroad operation. The presidents of the Pennsylvania and the Baltimore & Ohio, for instance, pained and surprised at the sug- gestion, admitted that no standard costs were kept for the variety of repairs on loco- motives or freight cars. An injection of three per cent., or thereabouts, of efficiency in operation would offset the much talked- of wage increase. And would increased efficiency be possible? It is a painful idea! Nevertheless, the expense accounts of the insurance companies which were supposed to represent the minimum that could be reached through the efforts of high-salaried men have, since the investigation, been proved to have represented only seventy-five per cent, of reasonably attainable efficiency. And there is the Illinois Central asking for a rate advance and pointing to a de- crease of some $700,000 in net earnings. This is j>oor grace in a management that in two years lost $1,500,000 in car and equip- ment repairs through fraud, which might not have been discovered at all. Such a loss would have been impossible where standard costs and modern scientific busi- ness protected the investors. Yet the Illi- nois Central has a large reputation for efficient management. What about this railroad efficiency? This is a rich vein. Perhaps, before rates are farther advanced, it should be explored. Surely the consumer—the man who pays —is not attacking the railroads, nor “killing the hen that lays the golden egg,” norputting the widows and orphans in danger,nor even exhibiting any extraordinary “anti-corpora- tion” animosity when he mildly suggests that before he contributes a larger income to the roads, they, on their part, should sec that nothing is wasted. What do you think? GOD S PRISONER BY Cl I.\K LOTTE WILSON Lord of wide spaces, though I wear Thy chains, Duty, and circumstance, and body's pains, Help Thou my soul to mock Thy prison-bars, And range Thy purple paths between the stars!THE PEACE DOVE of the TRES SANTOS BY HAROLD FINLEY ILLUSTRATIONS BY HORACE TAYLOR | 'HERE'S one thing about the alkali J. country; or, rather, there ain’t one thing — and that’s petticoats,” ob- served Riley, the foreman of the Tres Santos, with a yawn. “There’s one or two worse places than New Mexico at that,” he added. “It’s funny there ain't more marries Mexes, where it’s so near that or nothin', ain’t it?” remarked Johnson, the ditch boss. “I've seen the day when there wasn’t a white woman in thirty mile of here," con- tinued Riley. “Jack Wilkins went clean to San Anton’ for his wife. Jack was allowin’ that the kind of girl to stack up to an edu- cated taste didn’t grow in this valley, which they didn’t, either.” "The same being why you ain't fuller- in’ a baby carriage, I reckon,” suggested Andrews interestedly. Riley chuckled. Andrews, being ranch machinist and hence indispensable when anything “busted,” often took liberties with the foreman. "The difference between you and me, Jim,” Riley retorted, “is you'd be after hamessin’ up with anything that done her hair up the back, and I ain’t that kind of fool." He arose for perhaps the tenth time from his seat astride a bale of hay and peered out of the barn door at the beating rain, which was soaking countless tons of fresh-cut alfalfa and enforcing idleness upon himself and four unmistakably pleased ranch hands. “What a heap of fools there are,” replied Andrews languidly. “But say, how about Jack Wilkins? For a married man with a family I’d call the boss a right happy lunatic.” “Anybody would be a fool not to marry a girl like Missus Wilkins, if he had a chance," urged Riley patiently. “There was a time, though, when even you, Jim, would’ve made a better match for her than Jack Wilkins, in the opinion of most people hereabouts. I’m savin’ that with all respect for Jack’s wife, too.” Riley settled easily back and rolled a cigarette. He was rolling a second one be- fore he spoke again. “In his day Jack was something of a rounder,” he said at length. "That was be- fore some of you boys ever come to the val- ley or knew there was such a place on the map. Booze, faro—Jack, he went the whole route—and he went it. too, I’m right here to remark. His wife had domestic troubles that’d make any woman that ever hit Reno, Nevada, look like a blame cry- baby beside her. That was before a certain fowl we named the ‘peace dove’ begun t<. perch on the family rooftree. A Plymouth 327E very I jody’s M agazi nc Rocker this bird was, speckled, long-legged, pale around the gills. "Jack’s early trainin’ hadn’t had enough bed slat in it for his own good, to my way of thinkin’. Old Jud Wilkins was as savvy a cow-man as ever lived, but raisin’ kids wasn't his line. Puttin’ the ditch strip into farm land took all the old man's time; and besides that, Jack didn’t have any mammy from the time he was two years old. "The boy learned young. 1 caught him more than once soakin’ up tequila with the Mcxes when he was only a kid. For years he made a regular hangout of a crooked roadhouse on the Tunas trail, drinkin’ rotten whisky and buckin’ a brace-box that’d busted a plumber in six deals. 1 reckon he wasn’t over fourteen when he started this. "The worst mistake the old man ever made was to send the boy off to college. Honest, we couldn't foller him for smoke back there in the East. But old Jud was aimin’ to give the young devil what he con- sidered a fair chance, so he kept sweetenin’ the pot and worryin’. "When the old man died, the kid come back sobered down something amazin’ and said he was goin’ to run the ranch. That boy, for all he was brought up right here on the Santos, didn’t know no more about ranchin' than 1 do about quiltin’; but the place was his, and as long as he behaved himself we was satisfied. "There was something sanctified and unnatural about that first month Jack run the ranch. Ben McGrath and me drunk every drop of whisky on the place so’s he couldn't get at it. Then we all held our breath and waited. " Well, one day Jack said he was goin' to El Paso to get some oil for his machinery. He sure got it, too. Lubri- cated wasn’t no name for the condition he come back in. A 1b u- querque was the next sta- tion on the jag route, and then he got his gait. Inside of another month he was rip-snortin' over the country, leavin' a trail three states wide behind him. " But the worst of it was the way he took to shootin’ up the exchequer. Jack got to costin' us so much 1 never knew when I was goin’ to have enough to pay off the Mcxes. "One day we near had a strike on our hands. All that kept the help from leadin' off the livestock was some little reputation Ben and me had got back in the cow-rustlin’ days for handlin’ six guns. Well, right in the middle of my explainin’ that pay day was cornin’ around jest as soon as the young boss got back with the dinero, Jack lit on the scene drunk. He was towin’ along a big, soft-lookin’ souse he allowed was his ‘fra- ternity brother.’ “We sized the pair of ’em up, Ben and me, and decided to act. So we watched our chance and corailed the fraternity brother. I'm not sure, but I think it was twelve hours we give him to get a wire that his relatives was sick and needin’ him. I remember, all the time we was talkin’ Ben was fondlin' an inch board with a barrel cactus nailed on the business end of it. That fraternity cuss had a right smart respect for the uphol- stery Xature'd endowed him with, for he got his telegram that same evening. Then I braced Jack. ‘“Jack, boy,’ I says, ‘I was foreman of the Tres Santos before you was ever hatched. When your poor old dad cashed in I promised him forty times, if I promised him once, that I was goin’ to stick by you and the ranch,’ I says. ‘ When I done it,’ I says, ‘I didn't figure on runnin’ the old place as no jag asylum with a blanket mort- gage on it. You either make up what you consider to be your mind to cut this foolish- ness out and settle down,’ I says, ‘or you and your ranch can go plumb to thunder for all of me!' 1 says. “The next morning, instead of flaggin' the Santa Fe and goin’ to town. Jack got into some old breeches and rode ditch from sun-up to sun-down. The day after, he broke two sickles and a mower hagglin' up three borders; but it was a day’s work for him. Most surprisin’ of all was the way he appeared to get a hand on himself. Things perked up to beat the band. “ But one morning he was missin’, and we guessed it was all off. The only thing we were even speculatin’ about was what we were goin' to do to the fraternity brothers if he fetched any of ’em back with him.“Tin: WORST MISTAKE THE OLD MAN EVER M AUK WAS TO SEND THE BOV OFF TO COLLEGE." “We were all layin’ out in front of thc house on Sunday evening, when all of a sudden Edwin Summerville Kent let out a whoop that nearly ripped his linings out. You see, Edwin only had one lung, and was settin’ on the fence on account of the dew. Well, the next minute 1 was leanin’ against the fence myself, makin' noises like windin’ a dollar watch. “Up the lane was cornin’ a rubber-tired carriage behind a shiny bay. Inside was Jack Wilkins, dressed in ice-cream clothes and settin’ alongside of a girl. “Edwin showed the advantages of early bringin’ up by steppin’ out l>ig as life and hitchin' their horse for 'em. An’ then Jack lifted the girl out like she was a settin' of eggs. The missus is pretty enough now, but she sure was a pippin those days. Slim and round—big black eyes—this raven hair they talk so much about—cheeks like peaches and cream prettiest woman alive— that was her. ‘These are the Tres Santos boys, Roxie,’ Jack says. ‘ This is my wife, boys,’ he says, offhand-like. “I give a gasp for breath even yet some- times when I think of that remark of Jack’s. For the next five minutes us fellows were redder’n an acre of ripe cow beets. Even Edwin was knocked off his pins. Blamed if the girl didn't fetch a smile and get a little red herself. “‘That ain't no way to introduce any- body,’ she says to Jack. 'I want to know their names.' she says. Her voice was like little silver spurs a-jinglin’. Jack, bein’ sober, was stumped. He told her he’d been away on business so much he didn’t know- all of us himself. “‘Riley here hires 'em and fires 'em,' he says. Tie’s got their names and pedi- grees down cold.' Then he introduced me to her. “‘Sure, Mrs. Wilkins,’ I says, when I got my breath again, ‘but I’d rather not say anything about pedigrees except that none of the boys have been hung yet.’ Then I begun presentin’ ’em. ‘This oldish-like gent hidin’ his blushin’ features behind the whiskers is Mister McGrath,’I says. . . . ‘Him tryin' to get both his feet behind the other one is Mister McNary . . . This high and wide party,’ I says, ‘is Germany Schwartz. If Germany’s got any specialty. 3*0Everybody \s Magazine "l REMEMBER, ALL lilt TIME \\l: WAS TALKIN' BIN' WAS FONDLIn’ AN INCH BOARD WITH A BARREL CACTUS NAILED ON THE BUSINESS END OT IT." it’s drivin' mules, for he’s fluent and per- suadeful in Dutch and Mexican as well as American,’ I says. 'The gentleman you observe tryin' to edge around the corner of the house is Mister Anderson,’ 1 says. "Then 1 come to Edwin. ‘The lad here with the pale, intellectual dome and the specs is Mister Edwin Summerville Kent, from Boston, wherever that is,' 1 says. ‘If there's one thing Edwin is prouder of than anyotlierit’s the sunburn on hisarms,’ Isays. "Before she'd been with us a week, that girl just naturally turned the Santos upside down. Just her bein' with us went over the ranch like a bucket of whitewash. We moved the Mexes’ ’dobcs out back of the corrals so’s she couldn't hear ’em cuss; but Lord, we didn’t need to.- I never seen a civilizeder lot than they got to be after she come. ‘La scSlora chiquita', they called her. “Jack, he bought new furniture and had the porch built and hired a decent cook. We all took to shavin’. We even wore coals to the table till she asked us not to. Out on the job, when the belt flew off the baler, there was only the softest kind of cussin’, because she was always ridin’ around on a dinky little pony I gentled for her, watchin’ us. Germany got so he couldn’t drive mules for a cuss, he was that scared she’d understand what he said to ’em.” Kilev paused to take another look out of the barn door, but thc rain was pounding down as hard as ever and he returned and lighted another cigarette. There would be no more field work that day. "Where does your Plymouth Rock, or Huff Cochin, or whatever it was you said perched on the rooftree, conic in?” drawled Andrews. Riley gave no indication of having heard the question. "I don’t know as I ever rightly understood the ins and outs of the mess,” he continued. “I didn’t need to. 1 did learn one tiling after a while, though, which is that when a man’s spent ten or fifteen years cultivat in' the instincts of a coy- ote, not all the angels of kingdom come tan drive it out of him in a minute. I know that Jack Wilkins had a relapse all right. "One day 1 noticed the liquor signal in Jack’s face. The same day he went off to El Paso without sayin’ a word to his wife. Before that he’d as soon have left without his head. He come back four days later, boozed up considerable and sulky as a lo- coed greaser. The girl had kept to her room all the time he was away, and she come down with her eyes red and her mouth droopin’. The rest of us was eatin’ supper. When she seen the shape he was in, some- thing blazed up in her eyes and back she went upstairs again. I'll tell you the scrap that started that night like to never ended. “Thc next time Jack rounded thc curve to where the little brown jug was settin’, he went on a regular, old-time tear. The girl moved clean across the house from him and quit speakin’ to him. " From then on thc only time we saw' ’em was at meals once in a while. I’ll never forget one breakfast. The girl come in late, with her eyes all puffed out from cryin’, as they generally was about that time. The boys all said ‘Good Mornin’/ but Jack never looked up. She smiled kind of pitiful and set down at her end of the table. When the Mexican girl handed her her coffee, I seen a tear splash in the cup. “Well, we et away, pretendin’ not to notice. If somebody’d poured water on me I’d have cracked like a red-hot stove, I was that mad. 1 felt like gettin’ up and kickin’ Jack off the place. Just about then it was, I guess, I happened to notice that Edwin Summerville Kent, the kid with the specs and the one lung, seemed to have something on his mind. Two or three times he startedThe Peace Dove of the Tres Santos 331 to take a bite and stopped and looked at me. Then he lays down his fork. ‘“Mister Riley,’ he says, lookin’ kind of scared, ‘is it customary for hens to set at this time of year?”’ For the next two minutes a pin droppin’ would have sounded like a cannon ball failin’ through a bass drum, it was that quiet. Edwin got so red the sweat broke out all over his face. “‘Mister Kent,’ I says at last, ‘I ain't gone in for any exhaustin’ study of the sub- ject, but it's been my observation that when most hens take it in their heads to set, they set, summer or winter, and hell and high waters notwithstandin’.’ “‘I asked,’ says Edwin, ‘because there’s a speckled hen behind the corn box in the hay barn been settin’ on four onions ever since I come here.’ “‘That hen ain’t settin’; she’s restin’,’ Anderson says, straight off the bat. “‘Restin’ your eye!’ says McXary. ‘That hen was settin’ on three spuds in the same place six months before Mister Kent ever come here. Germany allowed that the same hen had set on two cowcumbers, to his posi- tive knowl- edge, for all of seven months be- fore that.’ “ ‘I throwed the same hen off a doorknob in the sheep corral many a day two year ago,’ says lien McGrath. “‘Well, it ain't any wonder she’s wore all the feathers off her chest, is it!' Edwin says. Jack had to grin in spite of himself, and the Missus giggled. Hen winked at me. “‘The way to break hens of wantin’ to set, Edwin, is to keep ’em soaked in water,’ he says. ‘Some authorities breaks ’em by pourin’ and some by immcrsin',’ he says. ‘It depends on their religious convictions.’ “‘Let her set,’ I says. ‘She ain’t hurlin’ nothin’. If every- body was as anxious to settle down and be domestic as that poultry is, they’d be better off,' I says. “‘Break her of it!’ says Jack, gettin’ sore. “Next day I run on to the whole bunch of ’em in the hay barn, foolin’ around the corn box. As near as 1 could see, the hen was tendin' to her own business, but her cluckin’ showed she was gettin’ riled some. “‘Dare you to pick her up,’ says Edwin to old Mexican Charley. “I put it into Mex for him. Charley crawled in behind the box and reached for her. That hen crowded him out so fast he nearly knocked the whole top of his head off on a loose board. Then she humps up her back and squats back on her onions. “Ben got her from behind. “ ‘ I bet she don't do no more settin’ now,' he says. He took her straight to the waterin' trough and soused her under. ‘Cut out your loafin’ on this garden truck, birdie, and lay an egg for a change,’ heE very body’s Magazine sivs, right severe-1 ike. ‘Thai II break 'em ivVrv lime, he >ays. sousin' her i<>r luck. She give one almighty squawk and made a bee line for the corn box. "‘That ain't goin’ to work.' says Edwin. “‘Yes, but it is. though,’ lien says. ‘That's habit. Wait till -he gets wise to how wet she is.' "‘She does seem kind of subdued-like.' admits Edwin. ‘•‘Oh, she wouldn’t peck nobody now." says McNary. Edwin sidled up and begun strokin* her on the back. •“Better roil <1 o w n y o u r sleeves, Edwin,' 1 says; but I was too late. By the t i m e Edwin had a half-Nelson on her, that hen had |wicked off all the hide the sun hadn't already burned off. and was squawkin' for more. Edwin got mad. He let her soak in the trough till the bubbles quit cornin'. It took her a full minute to come to, but when she d i d she *	give a peevish cluck -and headed for her onions. "For weeks that hen gol her cold plunge bath regular every day. Every time one of the boys went to the barn there’d be some earn- est cussin’, fol- lowed by an almighty splash and a mud-colored streak for the barn door. It got so that hen was the only bright spot in the all-pervadin' gloom. Meal- times the lxiys didn’t talk of nothin' else. Tryin’ lo raise a smile from the Missus got to be a regular game with us. " ’ Boys,' says Me.Nary one day, 'I believe that fowl is g e 11 i n ’ suspi- cious of this about it. Either those onions has got to hatch, or this settin’ business has got to be queered, or that hen’s goin’ to croak. Why,’ he says, ‘that hen used to scratch around and eat once in a while, but now’days the only lime she’s oil those vegetables is when she’s on her way to the trough or under water or on her way back lo the nest. I'm thinkin’ the water cure’s no bueno,’ he says. “Just then the girl piped in. ‘ Why don't you take the onions away and give the poor thing some real eggs?’ she says. It was the first raise we had got out of the Missus in quite a spell. •“Oh, I tried that long ago.' says Ander- son, before she'd hardly got the words out of her mouth. ‘That was when she was incubatin’ some Early Rose potatoes,’ he says. ‘ I held that hen down on top of seven good eggs for four hours steady,’ says An- derson, ‘but there was nothin’ doin’.

She’s as much on the set as ever, but she's gettin’ all- lired hard to catch of late.’ "‘I'm gettin' a handful of leathers every time now. She’ll soon be naked,’ says Edwin. 'She don't bite the way sin- used to. neither,' he says. Then he looks over at me. ‘I tell you. there's no two waysThe Peace Dove of the Tres Santos 333 won’t set on no eggs but her own, and she won’t lay none, so what are you to do? I guess she's a vegetarian,’ he says. "• By jinks, we ain’t tried her out on egg- plant yet,’ says Ben. The Missus stuffed a napkin over her mouth and run upstairs. “‘Ferget it!’ says Jack, after he'd nigh choked himself on a glass of water. "It was Kdwin that started things off the next time. Jack was enjoyin’ one of his morning-after grouches, and the girl looked like she was goin' to break down and have a boo-hex). You see, we'd kept on purpose from even mentionin’ the hen for three days. Well, we hadn’t any more than set down to dinner when Edwin speaks up and says: 'Gentlemen,' he says, 'this time to-morrow that hen won't be settin'.’ “‘Decided to cut her head off, have you, Kdwin?’ I says. “ ‘You know better than that,’ says Edwin. ‘I’ve been layin’ awake nights in- volvin’ some plans,’ he says. Well, the boys laid down their forks and looked interested as the devil. ‘All in the world you’ve got to do is to blindfold your hen and spin her around about seven times and then turn her loose,’ says Edwin. y---- ‘How’ll she ever find her {	onions then?’he says. j “‘Hecansmell’em.can’the?’ says Germany, winkin' at me. “' Smell nothin’!' says Edwin,	__ ‘That hen has such a cold in	^ her head from bein’ soaked in water she couldn’t smell double distilled ammonia, asafetida, and Limburgcr cheese all mixed together and held right under her snoot.’ “‘What's to hinder a blindfolded hen that can't smell from wanderin' in a ditch and drownin’ herself?’ says Ben. “‘Oh, there’s other ways of curin' her,' says Edwin, ‘if you object to that. What's the matter, for instance,’ he says, ‘with puttin’ her in one of these squirrel cages that spin round and round? I guess about all the settin’ she’d do in one of those would be 011 her head.’ The girl near choked, but the boys never batted an eye. “‘What's the next one?' we says. “ Here Edwin hauls out a sheet of paper. ‘This is where we call on science,’ he says. ‘If you gentlemen will study this diagram I’ve drawed, you'll grasp the idear,’ he says. ‘The problem rests on whether or not onions is conductors of electricity,’ says Edwin. ‘Let X be your battery,' he says, pointin' it all out on his paper. ‘ P and Q are copper wires, each terminatin’ in an onion. Call one onion A and the other B,’ he says. '.Now, then,’ he says, ‘when 11, which is hen, squats down just after her bath and resumes her settin’ stunt, she gets in contact with A and B simultaneous and closes the circuit. That minute blue sparks will lje Ilyin' and she'll get a shock that’ll jolt the liver out of her.’ “I'll be hanged if Jack and his wife didn't bust out and laugh till they cried. You know how a person under any kind of strain does when they do break loose. It was all the worse because they tried so hard to keep from it. I Swear I near died myself. “I remember McNary had a plan for puttin’ the hen's head in some kind of stanchion so she couldn’t do nothin’ but stand up. Germany’s scheme was to put weights 011 her legs so she'd have to set with- out movin’ till she was sick to death of it. Anderson was for changin’ her onions for prickly pears, and I remember I was rather in favor of that idea myself. Ben said to leave il to him and keep sousin' her for luck. “ I was off-saddlin’down by the sheds that night, when up rides Ben and yanks his saddle off and heaves it over the fence. I could see he was good and het up about something. 'What’s my time?' he says.334 Everybody’s Magazine “ ‘ W il y, what's broke loose now?' says I. " ‘Oh, noth- in’,’ he says, •	only the wild burro that o	w n s this ranch tells me he’s goin’ to fire every man on the place if this settin’ hen talk ain’t dropped. I’m goin’ to save him the trouble so far’s I m concerned,’ says Ben. •‘I told him I thought, myself, we was runnin’ the subject into the ground. “‘Runnin’ hell!’ Ben says. ‘That fool hen is a reasonin’ being compared with them two. They ought to be both of 'em chucked in the trough,’ he says. “‘Look here, Ben,’ I says, ‘it ain’t her place to l>e cavin’ in with him actin’ the way he is. That poor little woman is a lot like this hen the boys is houndin’ to death. All in the world she wants is to settle down and live like white folks and have a home and a family. All that drunken yahoot does is to throw her off the nest and abuse her.’ “‘If she wasn’t so feeble-minded she’d go back to her people; that’s all 1 got to say,’ says Ben, and he wasn’t just whisperin’ it, either. Lookin’ up, I seen Jack standin’ not twelve feet away by a pile of bales. He was redder than fire, but I guess neither of us give a damn for him. It wasn’t Jack that made the two of us feel like crawlin’ through the cracks in the fence. Standin’ in the door of the sheep shed was the girl! She went there every day to feed a pet lamb she was weanin’ from the ewe, and there she was with the bottle in her hand and her cheeks bumin’. There wasn’t nothin’ at all to say, and it was sure our move. “Things was relieved of a sudden by r n outlandish clatter which made us guilty parlies jump like we’d been shot from be- hind. It was hard tellin’ for a minute just what was happenin’. Then, through a cloud of dust, I managed to make out the ■=cttin’ hen tearin’ along, nine feet at a step, her clucks cornin’ easy a hundred and fifty to the minute. She was trailin’ ten feet of red rag from her tail. Right along behind her galloped Edwin Summerville Kent, lit- erally yellin’ his head off. The hen gave one flyin’ leap for the opposite fence. The rag caught on a nail and bang she went down, flat on her back. Edwin loosed her, and off she streaked it for the open fields. “I’m never after forgettin’ the way Edwin put his hand over his heart and bowed. “There’s nothin’ like havin’ a col- lege education,’ he says, all out of breath. The girl went straight to the house and Jack in the opposite direction. “It sure was a caution the way that hen carried on the next few days. Every hour or so you’d hear that peevish cackle bearin’ down 011 you, and she’d go sailin’ past with the rag standin’ straight out behind. Every so often she’d get tripped up and spin around in circles for five minutes at a time; then off she’d go again. There ain’t a Marathon runner livin’ would have had a smell of a chance against that hen. Ed- win didn’t do a thing but boast from morn- ing to night. Jack never oj>ened his head about firin’ him, either. “Then the fex>l hen was missin’ for a day. ‘“You might have knowed, Edwin, with all that college education of yours, that the poor critter would get caught to something in the bosquc and be et up by bobcats,’ says Ben. The girl give a gasp. For about the first time Edwin didn't have nothin' to say. The next minute we heard a rapid-fire cluckin’, and along past the window sails the hen under a full head of steam. “Then the hen did sure enough turn up missin’, red rag and all. It wasn’t three- days, either, till things got glum as ever. That hen had been the life of the ranch. The girl begun to look like she was due for a spell of sickness, and it was easy to see Jack was feelin’ mighty uncomfortable. “It must have been a month afterward— I know we were in the fourth cuttin’ and busy as the devil—that the girl asked Ger- many to go over the Rio Grande and get Doc Collins for her. Jack was in town. When Doc come, I hung around the house till he come out, and asked him if it was anything serious. Doc grinned and said it wasn’t nothin’ to worry about and begun dickerin’ ior a few tons of hay. Just the same, the boys were all good and worried, and I, for one, made up my mind Jack was goin’ to hear what I thought of him if I had to set on him while I was tellin’ it to him.The Peace Dove of the Tres Santos 335 Jack was sober for a change when he come home next day. He was lookin’ good and miserable, too, I’m tellin' you. Bein’ sober, I guess, give his conscience a chance to get in a little work. Anyhow, you could see lie was anxious when the girl come down to dinner that noon, lookin’ like a ghost ex- cept for two fever spots in her cheeks. “She was that nervous she couldn’t eat. Jack looked at her all the time, but she set there for three or four minutes without even liftin’ her eyes. Then she got up and went out on the porch. I was facin’ the window and couldn’t help seem’ her. She wasn’t any more than out the door when she tot- tered and put her hand up to her head. I was just after runnin’ out to keep her from failin’, when I seen her stop and stare out in the yard. Then of a sudden she begun to shriek and laugh—downright hysterics. It was somethin’ awful the way she screeched out. Like lightnin’ it come to me that her mind had give way on her. When she be- gun screamin’ for Jack I was sure of it. “Jack went out that door like he’d been jerked with a rope. I seen her turn quick as a flash and bite her lips and step back. She kind of shrunk away, like she was ashamed of herself, and all the blood in her body seemed to be in her face. “‘I forgot, Jack,’ she says, and I could see she was tryin’ to get a hold on herself. ‘Look at ’em, Jack!’ she says. Jack was right beside her and he stopped in his tracks and looked out into the yard. Then he let out a laugh you could have heard half a mile, and hollered ‘Boys!’ We all broke for the |)orch, and there they were with their arms round each other. “ I swear there was something holy in the look on that little girl’s face. Jack called her all their old pet names and kissed her hands and hair and mouth and squeezed her up to him like he was never goin’ to li t go of her again. We growed fast to the floor. Then she put both hands round Jack’s neck and hung to him like she was plumb tired out. I couldn’t make out what she was say- in' to him, and I wasn’t tryin’ to, but I couldn't help prickin’ up my ears when I heard Doc Collins’s name. Jack was tumblin’ all right, though, for he got pale as a sheet. All of a sudden he broke down. ‘“Roxie, my poor little Rox!’ he says. The next minute they were both of ’em cryin’ like a couple of babies. The boys come to and begun edgin’ into the house. “Just aL this embarrassin’ minute, Ed- win Summerville Kent let out one funny yelp. ‘Lookit!’he yells. ‘Lookit! Lookit!’ Then we got our wits back for a minute. There in the yard, square in front of us, was that settin’ hen we’d been missin’. There wasn’t any mistakin’ her; she still had a good two feet of the red rag trailin’ from her tail. She wasn’t runnin’ this time, though, and her cluckin’ was slowed down to some- thin’ like normal. She sure was scratchin’ the gravel, too, for I want to be hog-tied and hung by the heels, hombrcs, if that hen didn’t have two fuzzy little chickens traipsin’ alongside of her.” Riley slowly rolled another cigarette. Lei- surely he walked to the barn door and flung it open. “Still rainin’ a little, boys, but the sun’s peekin’ over the bosquc and there’s chores to do,” he announced in businesslike tones. Then, as he lifted a heavy Mexican saddle from its peg, he chuckled to himself. “I might have mentioned,” he said, "that the next time Doc Collins come over the Rio to see the Missus, Jack was waitin’ for him right here on the Tres Santos, anxiouser than anybody.”PACK YOUR TRUNK AND GO! by I;.Alexander Powell. I IVO'.S'. Author -4 "ALL ABOARD FOR BOMBAY!’*. “OX THE TRAIL OF 11AROU N -AL-RASC HID." ctc. PHOTOGRA PI IS BY MARY B. ASH MEAD AND UNDERWOOD AND UNDERWOOD L. MY friends, the world lies wide before you. North, south, east, west, the strange lands beckon and call. Can’t you hear them—the hansoms slurring through London mud, the roar of the boule- vards, the chugging of the stern-wheel river boat, the shrill summons of themuezzin from his minaret, the tinkle of anklet, and the boom of temple bells? Have you no wish to pack your trunk and go? .Means and health permitting, it is good for every man to see some little of this globe on which we live and the strange folk who move about it. It is good to escape for a time from the house of bondage—be it office or shop or bank—and to go abroad with no more exacting master than personal inclination and with no more definite plan of travel than has the horse, escaped from pasture, upon the countryside. Have you ever stopj>ed to think that there are things more important than the amassing of money; that there is a larger education than is to be found in class rooms or between the covers of books; that the world which lies beyond our little horizons can provide entertainments as amusing and more worth while than motoring or golf or bridge; that to taste of real adventure or of true romance —which, after all. are the seasonings that relieve the monotony of life’s daily pudding you must look beyond the dollar-twenty novel and the orchestra chair? Each of us, when all is said and done, has but one- life to live so why not make the most of that life; but one earth to spend it upon— so why not see and enjoy that earth? To those who would travel, and can't. 1 lift my hat in silent sympathy, with the hope that the years to come may bring them better fortune. But for those who are abundantly able to travel and won't—for those who, with education at theirjvery doors, refuse to bestir themselves, frankly admitting that they prefer the comforts of their clubs, theircard tables,and theircarsto the annoyances of foreign travel—for these I have but scant regard. Somewhere be- tween these extremes is the great middle class- fairly well-to-do folk, many of whom own a horse or a small motor car, most of w hom keep one or more servants, and very few of whom hesitate about going to the theatre when the spirit moves them, or to the seashore or mountains for their summer's vacation. The real reason why these people 33<>don't travel is that their lives have run so long in the same track that it is almost im- possible to get them out of the rut they have made. But suggest this to them, and instantly you will be silenced under an avalanche of protestations. 1 “I don’t go abroad because I can't afford it,” says one, with a pathetic gesture, as he cranks up his two-thousand-dollar motorcar. Says another, “I can't spare the time,” or. “1 wouldn’t dare to leave my business”— hut the next summer you go fishing with him in Maine or read that lie has won the amateur golf championship of the Adiron- dacks. " No, sirec! ” exclaims a third, “you don't catch me going to foreign parts; I’m loo fond of the comforts of home.” Wealth, I answer, is not imperative for travel. Last summer a Boston gentleman and his wife went to Europe on an exjK-ri- niental trip of eighty days, visiting more than thirty interesting cities in live great countries, at a total cost of $315 each or S.*.04 apiece per day. This included every actual necessary expense, steamer passage Im.iIi ways they had a line, promenade- deck. two-berth stateroom on one of the slower boats of a well-known line', railwav fares, hoard, street cars, carriage hire, all tips, admission fees, lunches, fruit, laundry, guidebooks; practically everything, in fact, which could properly be included. “It was third-class railway travel and simple pen- sions, of course,” the gentleman in question writes, “but 1 wish to be perfectly frank in saying that we lived, on the whole, just a trille better and more comfortably, averag- ing the whole trip, than ,we do at home, and at home we d*> not practice self-denial to an extent which requires the official at- tention of the authorities." Your time may be limited, but if you can spare six weeks and sis hundred dollars you can go round the world. If it is business which hinders, you need not be out of touch with it for a single hour, by night or by day, by sea or by land. l>oes not the wireless Hash and splutter from every masthead? I )■ not the slim cables slip out to sea beneath the waters of every port? May not one step into a closet and talk a thousand miles? And you do not go. you say, because you fear for your comforts? Why, man, you ran play golf over an eighteen-hole course in Uganda: the Runison Road is no whit pleasanter for motoring than tin- splendidE very 1 kkIv’s Alagazine highway which leads from Cairo t<> the Pyramids; ■>11 the railways of Russian Cen- tral Asia you can have a drawing-room with electric lights and running water fur the price of a Pullman section here at home; when you wish a servant in the hotels of India you do not have to ring one is be- side you when you clap your hands; there is a hostelry in Berlin where you dine in mid- winter, overlooking a garden of red gerani- ums, and where it is as much as the lift- men’s places are worth to keep a guest waiting even a single second for an elevator. Money, time, business, comforts—none of them is an insuperable obstacle in the path of him who really wants to go. Nothing is farther from my intention than to imply that Americans do not travel. The fact which 1 am trying to drive home is that a very great many more people could and should travel than do. Though there are many millions of us who remain at home for reasons having to do with babies, business, bank books, or bread and butter, there are many, many thousands for whom there has come to be a call, an irresistible fascina- tion in the very whistle of a train, in the rumble of wheels upon the track, in the thunder of the waves that go swirling aft along the rail, in the very sense of locomo- tion, of going somewhither, somehow. A decade ago it was the English globe-trotter’s kit-bag and portmanteau that one saw on every steamship wharf and railway plat- form from Southampton around to Shang- hai; to-day it is the suit case and steamer trunk of the traveling American. Though it may be that with many of us travel means but an escape from the commonplace, I like to think, rather, that it is a throwback to those Boone and Crockett ancestors of ours who plodded westward and ever westward that they might see with their own eyes what lay beyond the ranges. Once get us out of our grooves, and we are the easiest of all peoples to induce to set our feet on the long trails which lead from Oshkosh and Snohomish and Pawtucket and Kalamazoo to Miramar, Barbizon, Bellagio, Granada where you will. Put a picture, in colors, of Lake Lucerne, with the snow-capped Alps looming up in the distance, before the cashier of a bank in the Middle \Ve>t. Tell him he can get there in ten days, for less than a hundred dollars, and the chances arc that within a week he will begin to ask questions about rates and />< nsioiis and a dozen other things of which lie had only the vaguest ideas a few days before. A week later he has bought a Baedeker, ordered a steamer trunk, and paid twenty-five dollars deposit on his ticket. It is in some such fashion as this that we, the most practical of all peoples, are fast blossoming into a nation of travelers. I never appreciated, myself, how many of us have become infected with the contagion of travel until, one day last spring, 1 stood on the end of a Hoboken pier and waved I)on voyage to some friends who were sailing for Europe on one of the fastest and most luxurious of the transatlantic liners. The gang plank was drawn in, the last cable had been thrown off, and slowly and silently the big boat slipped out into the channel. She was white with fluttering handkerchiefs; perhaps there were eight hundred cabin passengers aboard her. “Powell," remarked a friend who stood beside me, “there’s a million dollars of American money aboard that ship that’s lost to this country for good and all. Figure it out for yourself: say eight hundred people in the first cabin with drafts or letters of credit averaging a thousand dollars apiece —and mighty little of it will they bring back —to say nothing of second-cabin passengers and the amount spent in passage-money. Why, man, it’s appalling!” Two piers south another “greyhound,” with every berth occupied, was getting under way. Three others had already sailed that morning, and four more would depart before the day was done. In all, five thousand people were due to leave New York that day. And New York, though the largest, is by no means the only port from which passengers sail at regular inter- vals for Europe. But just stop and think what that means to American education and American culture—five thousand of our people sailing for Europe from one port in a single day! The number of Americans who visited Europe last year reached the amazing total of three hundred thousand. Reckoning that they left abroad or with the steamship companies an average of $700 apiece— surely a very moderate estimate—it will be seen that this country parted with the enormous amount of $210,000,000. The business of entertaining the traveler—espe- cially the American traveler—has become a leading industry in many countries. AnPack Your Trunk and ('•<»! American, making his way through an im- poverished section of Ireland, inquired of a native, "What do the people round here live on. Pat?" " Pigs in the winther, sorr." was the answer, "and tourists in the sum- mer." Now that answer had in it the germ of much economic truth, for if "th' ould sod" is sustained by summer travelers, so. in far greater proportion, are Switzerland. Italy, and France. Do you appreciate, my friends, that Switzerland's imonte from tour- ists is greater than that from all her exports put together{ Did you know that the toll which Italy collects from her visitors is equal to the value of all her exports from January to May? Can you hazard even a guess as to France’s annual income from the traveler? As far back as 1907 it was $000- 000,000, and it is estimated that in the year just passed it approximated three quarters of a billion dollars. I don't like figures, and you probably don’t either, but it seems worthy of note that last year our travelingcountrywomcn left eight millions of dollars with Parisian dressmakers (I beg your pardon, modistes), and a million and a half with rue de la Paix and rue St. Honore milliners, not to mention another two million or so spent in the same gay city for trilling mementoes alone. For furs and jewelry Mr. and Mrs. American Tourist probably left forty million dollars in Europe last year. All of which indicates not only the American love of travel but the American extravagance. Europeans are astonished, to put it mildly, at the senseless prodigality with which a certain class of traveling Americans spends money. This reckless spirit in matters financial has done more than anything else, indeed, to confirm foreigners in their belief that U. S. is derive*I from $. anti does more than any one thing to make European travel unnecessarily expensive for Amer- icans of moderate tastes and means. Not onlj is the excessive liberality of money-burdened \mericans in wretched taste, but it has unquestionably lowered the standard of European commercial morality and exaggerated the veniality of foreign shop and inn keepers. Hut it was not until I saw a voung scion of American aristocracy throwing his unused !ive-//7r bills from the steamer at Genoa to the scrambling. lighting rabble on the quay below, that I fully under- stood what incalculable damage such ex- hibitions of vulgarity do to the self-respect • >i both traveling Americans and the |»eoples whom they visit. Onl\ then did 1 appreciate the crying nenssily for .1 proclamation which, by the orders of the Governor- General, has been posted conspicuously in every train, tourist steamer, and hotel in the Sudan Ii reads as follows: Travelers, while in the Sudan, are par- ticularly requested to refrain from gain- ing an easy reputation for generosity by giving money to children, beggars, and other persons who have not earned it. At present the population of the Sudan has not been demoralized by indiscrimin- TIII. -IIKIII M MUONS 01 nil MI I.//IS lk'.i\| III- MINAKI.r.Every!>o<ly's M agazino exhibitions of vulgarity and ostentation must not be taken as criteria of the expendi- tures which would have to lie made by the sane and economically-minded American who wants to travel abroad. On the contrary, I am inclined to think the true reason for the rapidly rising tide of Amer- ican travel Europeward is that our people are beginning to learn that it is cheaper to t ravel abroad than at home. In other words, you can get to Europe cheaper than you can get to equally distant points in our own country, and you can live considerably cheaper, if you are so minded, after you get there. Berth and meals included, it costs about $125 to get from New York to the Pacific Coast, and it takes con- siderable skirmishing to find, in San Francisco, Los Angeles, or Santa Barbara, the kind of hotels at which the average pleasure seeker wishes to stop, for less than three dollars a day. Against this, there are many steamship lines which will convey one from New York to any one of a dozen European ports, with first-class accommodation and meals, for from $60 to $75. And in Europe one can be exceedingly comfort- able at hotels which, if not ultra- fashionable, certainly correspond to our three-dollar-a-day houses, for $1.50 to $2 a day. Here, then, is the condition which confronts the American railroad official and hotel-keeper: it costs less, considerably less, to get to, and live in, England or France or Germany or Switzerland or Italy than it does to visit California or Washington or Oregon. Therein you have the real explanation of the popularity of Europe. Il costs less. It is not a case of the New York Central competing with the Pennsylvania, or the Santa Fewith the Union Pacific, but of thc rail- roads of the United States com- peting with the transatlantic steam- ship lines for the patronage of hundreds of thousands who are going somewhere. Until those who are responsible for the direction of our railroads and the management of our hotels are willing to admit this unpleasant truth, and to treat ate almsgiving, but it will not require much of this to make the demand “Bak- shish!” as importunate and annoying to travelers as in Egypt itself, and to cause a considerable number of natives to for- sake the paths of honest industpr for the unwholesome existence of preying upon others. His Excellency the Governor- General trusts that all travelers will con- sider this as a personal request from him- self. 1 have switched rather abruptly, as I per- fectly well realize, from the main track of my article; but I have no apologies to make, for I wish to emphasize thc fact that thesePack Your Trunk and Go! I he American tourist as a valuable customer to whom concessions should be made, instead of as a victim who should be browbeaten and fleeced, just so long will those three hundred thousand Ameri- cans, and many more besides, con- tinue to spend their two hundred- odd millions of good American dollars on the other side of the pond. Even in the raw, new nations of the antipodes the comfort and pocketbook of the traveler are better cared for than in this highly civilized America of ours. In Aus- tralia and New Zealand travel is looked upon by the governments as a form of education and is treated as such. Everything con- nected with it —coast, lake and river steamers, railway lines,hotels, restaurants, natural wonders of every kind are under the super- vision of the Ministry of Travel. Throughout these far lands the government acts as conductor, tourist agent, chaperon, and pro- tector to the lone traveler. Mag- nificently equipped official infor- mation bureaus are maintained by the government in the chief cities, while throughout the land an army of licensed and educated guides stands ready to show the man from home or from abroad something at first hand of the resources of the country. The dining-car services of the _____ Australian and New Zealand rail- ■■■ ways, as well as the restaurants rn route, are under government supervision, the name of the caterer and the prices which lie i- permitted to charge for food being printed and conspicuously displayed in each railway carriage and station. A meal of live courses may l»e hail for fifty cents, and even the price of an extra glass of milk is regulated by law. If the caterer fails to keep his table up to the standard which the government requires, an official of the Ministry of Travel steps in and, by practical experiments, decides just what prices should be asked for a specified meal —allowing, of course, a fair profit to the caterer—and the readjustment is made. Hut at all times the comfort and pocketbook Ajr	/ v.t a *.v/ -Tin: BOOM or TEMPI.!. BELLS. of the man who travels are considered first. The government's policy in feeding its travelers is much the same as that pursued by Fred Harvey, the caterer who made the old-time restaurants along the Santa I e route famous. Harvey was once asked to what lie attributed his remarkable succes-. "To cutting my pies into four portions iii- >tead of six." replied Harvey. “Overfeed a man and he i> more likely to come again than if you give him barely enough.” Nor have the Australian and New A. land governments confined their efforts to caring for the traveler's inner man. New roads have been cut, opening up places ■ ! interest, to which government-owned mot rEveryl>< >dv's Magaztne tars tarry sightseers at rate- no higher than the ordinary stagecoach fare: government launches have been placed on the mountain lakes and government guides in the forests along every trail: government baths have been erected at the hot springs, ami at thc government bureaus tourist maps may be had for the asking; definite and reliable information is supplied regarding routes, roads, and hotel charges, and trips are planned down to the last detail to meet the requirements of all purses. Going even farther in their paternal < are of the traveler, the governments are now building their own hotels, opening their own seaside resorts, anti conducting week-end excursions at prices within the reach <>f all. Those who hold the reins of power in the great antipo- dean commonwealths feel that the state should extend to the traveler the same as- sistance and protection that it does to the student. In no country in Europe is travel so ex- pensive as in our own. The Belgian railway fares are thc cheapest in the world. For $2.25, lor example, one can obtain a ticket entitling him to travel wheresoever he pleases, night and day if he desires, over the kingdom’s 2,5.50 milesof railway, for a period of five days. A similar ticket for a period of fifteen days costs $4.70, while for an ex- penditure of twenty-five cents a day it is possible to travel as much as one pleases for a whole year. In Switzerland, owing to the increased cost of railway maintenance in a mountainous country, these season tickets, or general aboiiueniciils, as they are called, are slightly higher. $6.75 being charged for the privilege of traveling at will over the railways of the Confederation for a fort- night.

At one in lhe morning, perhaps, the door of your com- partment w ill be unlocked from the outside and, without so much as by-your-leave, a police official, the train conductor, the guard, the local station master,and two gendarmes, every one belted, booted, flat-capped, and with a revolver the size of a small cannon strapped outside his greatcoat, come filing in. startling you awake by flashing their dark lanterns in your eyes. Line for line, you arc compared with the de- scription on your passport; you are asked a number of impertinent and wholly irrelevant questions in gut- tural German or indifferent French; your tickets are examined with the same minute care that a cashier bestows on a questionable bank note; and with a last suspicious glance at you and your belongings, your nocturnal visitors file out as silently as they came in, and you are left to your interrupted sleep —until the next large station is reached, when the entire perform- ance is repeated. But if the Russians annoy you by night, they feed you well by day; in fact, I know of no country where you get such good food, and so much of it, for your money. Russia, as you perhaps know, is the home of the chafing-dish, and in every railway restaurant you will find a long and shining row of them —twenty, thirty, even forty, per- haps—set out on a spotless counter. It is not necessary to speak Russian to order a meal, for all that you have to do is to walk down the line, lifting the cover of each chafing- dish until you come to something which appeals to your sense of sight or smell. A motion to the white-capped waiter, and a plate of the chosen dish is set before you, together with the accompanying vegetables, a glass of salted and altogether delicious tea, and a small bottle of harsh Caucasian wine—all for fifty cents. Only once have I ex- perienced any difficulty in ordering a Russian meal, and that was when I asked for some butter in a railway restaurant in Astrakhan. In four languages I asked for it, and each time the stolid Tartar waiter uncompre- hendingly shook his head. Then I seized a piece of bread and with a knife went through the motions of spreading. Instantly Ivan nodded in understanding and disappeared. After ten minutes lie returned, bearing in triumph a platter heaped with sliced bread, each slice spread thick with caviare. “Well,” thought I consolingly, “caviare is doubtless as cheap in Astrakhan as butter is in Amer- ica, and I might as well enjoy it." But when I saw the bill I changed my mind: theyPack Your Trunk and Go! .>45 charged me three dollars for it. 1 begrudge that three dollars still. Prosperity and tin- II'anderlust go hand in hand. The tide of travel rises with national well-being and ebbs again in lean times. 1'he years since igoo have witnessed more money-making throughout the world than any others in history. This same period has seen not only the development of tourist routes that had been merely pioneer paths, but a revolution in thc speed of transoceanic steamships and of transcontinental trains. For always the cry is for speed, speed, and yet more speed. Many of us marked an epoch for ourselves when Jules Verne wrote "Around the World in Eighty Days.” Per- haps it was not possible then to go round the world in eighty days; the book would have been less exciting if it had been. But in any event, it was nearly possible, and so eighty days has come to convey to us in more or less intelligible terms the size of the world. To-day, how- many of you could say offhand to what those eighty days have been reduced? By making use of the fastest trains and boats they can be cut in two as easily as a butcher halves a piece of meat, while, by making close connections, with trains and steamships running reasonably within their own best time, il is entirely possible to en- circle the globe in thirty-eight days. and that in comfortable trains and ships, with every luxurious accompaniment of modern travel; not by the desperate expedients of Phineas Fogg. You are no true American unless you instantly ask how—and how- much. There are several ocean greyhounds whose captains will undert ake to land you at Cherbourg or Havre in less than six days and in ample time to make connections at Paris with the Nord Express, so that thc evening of the eighth day -hould find you in the Gare de Koursk in Moscow, climbing into a wagon lit of the Trans- Siberian Express for your five- thousand-mile flight across Asia to the Japan Sea. With no un- usual delays this portion of the journey should be accomplished in eleven days, which, after ali. is .i the rate of only twenty miles an hour.

I do not recommend racing round the world in six weeks. Yet it is interesting to know that it can be done: and in the case of a busy man who cannot possi- bly get away for more than a few weeks and insists on seeing many coun- tries. even hurriedly, there is some- thing to be said for the rush around the world. To the newspaper reader distant parts of the earth can be little more than names and the chief actors upon those stages little more than shadows—until he has seen them. But let him once see them, if only for a few hours, and the picture will rise before his vision every time he reads of them lor the rest of his life. lie fits the facts into the frame and paints them in the right colors. He has spent only a day or two in Berlin, |)erhaps, but when he reads of the spring review on the Tempelhof field he sees the coming and going of dazzling officials and equerries, the gleaming breast- plates and eagle-helmets and black horses of tile Garde du Corps, even the stern, set face and erect figure of the War Lord himself. He may have stayed only a few hours in Naples; but when he reads of an eruption of Vesuvius he again sees the grim and smoking mountain rising above the cobalt bay, he has scant difficulty in picturing the trailing clouds of dust and cinders and the highways choked with terror-stricken fugitives, and he realizes, as he never did before, what such a catastrophe means to the prosperity of southern Italy. His steamer may have touched _ just for a morning at Tangier, but ■1M when he reads at the breakfast table of the lighting in .Morocco, lie sees again, as on a moving-picture screen, the white-walled, flat-roofed houses and the narrow, lilth-strewn street?; the haughty, tierce-faced tribesmen and the young French officers of the chasscurs d'Afrii/uc in their light blue tunics riding insolently among them.

He to whom the pages of the atlas bring neither memories nor ambitions is like Sir Fopling Flutter, to whom every place outside of Hyde Park was the desert, or Sydney Smith, who held thatPack Your Trunk and Go! .U7 a life lived out of London was a life misspent. Every day the world grows smaller. Tur- bine engines, oil-burning locomotives, aero- planes, electric block-signals, the wireless they are playing a marvelous part in linking up and lighting up the dark corners of the earth. The fact that one can go round the world in six weeks does not mean so much thirty-eight days, its it means that civil- ization has progressed, and that, thanks to the new inventions and the hundredfold in- creased efficiency they have given to us, we can now reach Dire Dawa or Antananarivo or Negri Sembilan as quickly, and much more easily, than the New Yorker of sixty years ago could reach San Francisco or Vienna or Puget Sound. Why, the whole wide world, my friends, is being opened up for your benefit and pleas- ure. Until Roosevelt went a-shooting, most of you were probably quite unaware that Uganda could be reached by rail, and that, seated comfortably on the cowcatcher of the locomotive, you could see all the animals of the menagerie and the ark in their native haunts beside the track. Did you know, 1 wonder, that a tourist agency advertises hotel-coupons for a hostelry at Nairobi, and that excursion boats run regularly to Ujiji, where, within the memory of most of us, Stanley, emerging from the jungle into a clearing with rude native huts, lifted his helmet at sight of a gaunt, fever-stricken man and said, “Doctor Livingstone, 1 be- lieve?” Timbuctoo has been a familiar name to you all your life, though your ideas may have been very vague as t<> where ii was: but you might In- glad to know that you can go there now, ii you please, tw thousand miles up the Senegal and down the Niger, by boat and train, and under tin ;«r<•- tection of the French flag all the way. From Cape Town the great Cape-to-C'airo trunk line has been pushed twenty-five hun- dred miles northward, and only the other flay crossed the Congo border to a point where it will eventually link up with the Uganda system and so on to the railways of the Sudan, so that in a few years more the traveler who tires of sitting on the terrace at Shepheard’s can get into a train in Cairo and a fortnight later find himself sitting on the verandas of the Mount Nelson in Cape Town. The traveler who would go from Argentine to Chile need no longer brave the rigors of a carriage journey over the Andes or a voyage around the Horn, for the rail- way has just been opened bet ween Valparaiso and Bucuos Aires and you can go from tide- water to tidewater in steam-heated and electric-lighted trains. In Russian Central Asia you can see Bokhara and Samarkand and Tashkent from your car window, and in Arabia the Holy Railway has been pushed southward and ever southward until its engines are whistling under the walls of Mecca itself.

But thc elder Anthony's message, when it comes, pronounce* Kirk an impostor, and Weeks, furious, throws his guest out. That evening, in a public park. Kirk comes upon a young Jamaican negro. Allan Allan, who is also homeless, and the two start out together in search food. On the wav, they are involved in thc cicitcl commotion of a tire, and Kirk, impatient at the incompetence of the firemen, lakes a band. In an attempt to resist interference, he turns a hose on an official who. it happens, is the commandant of police. Thereupon, both Kirk and Allan arc arrested, thrown into jail ami brutally treated. The English consul secures Allan release, but Weeks refuses to get Kirk out; eventually Al an reaches the Cortlandts. at Panama, and they hasten to Colon, rescue Kirk, and carry him home as their guest. Shortly after, he sets an unsigned letter . vidently from his father indicating that the police authorities are looking for him and refusing all aid unless Kirk can ’* make a man tit himself.'

He is instantly remorseful, and pleads for her pardon as he takes her to the native house where she is tn spend the night C HAPTER XII Continued BUT as they trudged along together through the dark. Kirk's chagrin re- turned in full force. Mrs. Cortlandt maintained a distressing silence, and he could not see her face. Presently he began to |>lead brokenly for forgiveness, stumbling in the effort not to offend her further, and feeling that he was making matters worse with every word he uttered. For a long time she made no reply, but at last she said: “ Do you think I ought ever to see you again after this?” “1 suppose not,” said Kirk miserably. "1 won't believe," she went 011. "that you took me for the kind of woman who— " “No, no!" he cried in an anguish of self- reproach. "I was a fool-” “ Perhaps I was partly to blame," she said; “but 1 didn't think—1 ought to have known that no man can really be trusted. I thought our friendship was so beautiful and now you've spoiled it.” "Don't say that!" Kirk begged. “You’ll surely forgive me sometime." But instead of answering him directly, she proceeded in the same strain, probing his wounded self-respect to the quick.TI1H HUMAN ANTS WERE WORK IN'. AT THEIR IIIIXS.

Although he assured her over and over lhat he had simply followed the irrespon- sible, unaccountable impulse of a moment that he had regarded her only as the best of friends and respected her more than he could say, site showed him no mercy. The melancholy, regretful tone she adopted was ten times worse than anger, and by the time they reached the inn where they had dined, he was sunk in the depths of self- abasement. If he had been less preoccupied with his own remorse, he might have reflected that Kdith’s attitude, especially as she did not expressly withhold the prospect of ultimate pardon, established a closer bond between them than ever before. But there was no room in his mind for such a thought. Ill reply to his knock an old woman came lo the door and sleepily admitted them. Edith stood for a moment on the threshold, then said good-night and. quietly entering, rinsed the door behind her. Kirk experienced a sudden desire to i'soulie. To remain where he was simply prolonged his humiliation. Instinctively, he felt that if he could only get away where he could view the matter in an everyday light it would cease to trouble him. Hut evidently hr could not desert Edith. He ■-at down upon the door-step and gave him- -elf up to bitter thoughts. She was such a wonderful woman, he t -*ld himself.she had been such a true friend lo	him. that hr had been worse than crim- inal to lose her rrspect. And Cortlandt had been so decent to him! It was significant that this gave him the most discomfort of all. He had betrayed a man's friendship, and the thought was unbearable. No punishment could be too severe for that. He was Mill sitting there cramped and stiff, when the tlr>t faint Hush of dawn stole ovrr the hill crest behind him. Then he rose to wander toward the water front. As the harbor assumed definite form, he bvheld a launch stealing in toward the village, and ten minutes later greeted Stephen Cortlandt as that gentleman stepped out of the lender. "Where's Kdith?" eagerly demanded her husband. "She's asleep. I found a place for her—” "Not at the Sanitarium!" "No. no. One «>f thc-e houses. Lord! I'm glad to six* you! We’d begun to feel like real castaways. 1 ve been up all night " "What happened?” ll was plain that Mr. Cortlandt was deeply agitated. "Our boatmen evidently got drunk anil pulled out. 1 tried to get a sailboat, but there weren't any. and it was loo rough to try crossing with a skill." It took them but a moment to reach the house, and soon the three were back at the water front. "What a miserable night! " Mrs. Cort- landt complained, stifling a yawn. "I thought you’d never come, Stephen!” "I didn't get back to the Tivoli until midnight, and then I had trouble in finding a boat to bring me over.” "1 suppose they were alarmed at the hotel?" "1 said nothing about it,” he returned quietly, at which his wife's face flushed. Seizing thr lirsi occasion, he exclaimed in a low voice: "(iod! How unfortunate at this lime. Were you mad?” She looked at him, and her eyes burned, but she said nothing. CH \PTER NIII OIJQUITA The day following their return from Taboga Kirk borrowed a shotgun and went hunting. The events of that night on the island seemed like a dream. Could it be that he had really blundered irre- trievably? Was it jMissible that he had offended his best friend past forgiveness? Now that he had caught up on his sleep, he wanted to get awav somewhere and collect hi> thoughts, lor the present, at least, he wished to avoid an interview with Mr'. Cortlandt. A milr or two beyond the railroad track, to the north and east, began what ap- peared to be an unbroken wilderness, and thither he turned his steps. Low, rolling hills lay beforr him. densely overgrown, and leading upward to a mountain range which paralleled the coast until the distant haze swallowed it up. These mountains, he reflected with a thrill of interest, led on to South America, the land of the Incas. hidden in mystery as the forests close at hand were veiled in faint purple. The very thought was romantic. Balboa had strained his eyes along these self-sameThe Ne’er-Du-Well placid shores; Pizarro, the swineherd, had followed them in search of Dabaiba, that tabled temple of gold, leaving behind him a trail of blood. It was only yonder, five miles away, that Pedrarias, with the murder of a million victims on his soul, had founded the ancient city which later fell to Morgan's buccaneers. Even now, a league back from the ocean, the land seemed as wild as then. Anthony suspected that there were houses —perhaps villages—hidden from his view; but vast stretches of enchanted jungle in- tervened, which he determined to explore, letting his feet stray whither they would. If game, of which he had heard great stories, fell to his hand, so much the better. Heeding a warning not to bear arms through the streets of Panama without a permit from the alcalde, he struck off across the fields in a bee-line for the woods. It was a vast relief to be out in the open air with a gun upon his arm once more, and he felt his blood coursing vigorously. The burden upon his spirits insensibly began to lighten. After all, he had done nothingfor which he needed to be ashamed the rest of his life. Edith, of course, was right in being deeply offended. That was to be expected. Yet his conduct, regrettable as it was, had been only natural under the circumstances. Sow that the first tumult of feeling had subsided, he found that his conscience did not accuse him very severely. And somehow, he was unable to believe that the breach with Edith would prove irreparable. She was a sensible woman of the world—not a mere schoolgirl. Per- haps when the immediate shock of the occurrence had passed, she would consent to take a different view of it, and they might return to their old friendly footing. If not —he would be his own man soon, anyhow. Their lives would part, and the incident would be forgotten. He was sorry that in his momentary madness he had behaved improperly toward a woman to whom he owed so much; yet it was not as if he had shown meanness or ingratitude. Across the meadows deep in grass he went, skirting little ponds and marshy spots, growing more cheerful with every step. In one place he had the good luck to raise a flock of waterbirds, which he took for purple gallinules and spur-wing plover, although they were unlike any he had ever seen. In some scattered groves beyond he bagged a pigeon and missed a quail, which unexpectedly whirred out >i thicl.et. Then he continued past herds of grazing cattle to another patch of woodland, where he came upon something that looked like path. Through rankly growing hunan.i patches, yam fields, and groves of mango trees he followed it, penetrating ever deeper into the rolling country, until at last he reached the real forest. He had come several miles, and realized that he could not retrace his steps; for the trail had branched many times, he had crossed other pathways, and made many detours. He rejoiced in the thought that he had successfully lost himself. At midday he paused in an open glade against a hillside to eat his lunch. Back of him, the rising ground was heavily tim- bered: beneath him, a confusion of thickets and groves and cleared fields led out to a green plain as clean as any golf links, upon which were scattered dwellings. Evidently those were the savannas of which he had heard so much, and those foreign-looking bungalows were the coun- try homes of the rich Panamanians. Be- yond, the bay stretched in unruffled calm, like a sheet of quicksilver, its bosom dotted with rocky islets, while hidden in the haze to the southward, as he knew, were the historic Pearl Islands, where the early Spaniards had enriched themselves. Gazing at this view in lazy enjoyment. Kirk found himself thinking how good it was to be young and free, and to be set down in such a splendidly romantic coun- try. Above all, it was good to be heart- whole and unfettered by any woman’s spell —men in love were unhappy persons, harassed by a thousand worries and in- decisions, utterly lacking in poise. It was a lamentable condition of hysteria, with which he decided to have nothing to do. He did not care for women anyhow. One could scarcely have any dealings with them without becoming involved in some affair that unduly harrowed one’s feelings. How much better it was to know the clean spirit of adventure and the joy of living, undis- turbed by feverish emotions! As he reclined there, busied with these thoughts, two vivid little paroquets alighted near him, to quarrel noisily, then make up and kiss each other like any pair of lovers. It was disgusting. A toucan peered at him with a look of exaggerated curiosity, due to its huge, grotesquely proportionedWHAT Do YOU WANT HERE r" i'RIED THE XEORBSS MENACINGLY. SHE HAD THRUST HER I HAR'.E BEHIND HER AND NOW PIERCED HIM WITH HER EYES. 35-’The Ne'er-Do-Well beak. Now and then came the harsh notes of parrots as they fluttered high above the tree tops. Meanwhile the young man’s ears became attuned to the jungle noises, his eye observant of the many kinds of life about him. The wood was crowded with plant life utterly strange to him. On the hill above towered a giant ceiba tree, its trunk as smooth as if polished by hand and bare of branches except at the very top, where, in- stead of tapering, it ended abruptly in a tuft of foliage. Here and there stood tre- mendous cotton trees, their limbs so bur- dened with air-plants as to form a series of aerial gardens, their twigs bearing pods filled with down. Beside them palm trees raised their heads, heavy with clusters of nuts resembling dates in size and form but fit only for wild pigs. Clumps of bamboo were scattered about, their shoots spring- ing from a common center like the streams from a fountain, and sweeping through graceful curves to a spray of shimmering green. He had never seen such varieties of growth. There were thick trees with bulbous swellings; tall trees with but- tressed roots that ran high up the trunks; slender trees propped up head high above the earth on tripod-like roots or clusters of legs; trees with bark that shone like a mirror; trees guarded with an impregnable armor of six-inch bony spikes—Kirk did not know the names of half of them, nor did he care to learn. Vines and creepers abounded, from the tiny honeysuckle that reared itself with feeble filaments, to the giant liana creeping through the forest like a python, throttling full-grown trees in its embrace. On every side was the never-ceasing battle for light and the struggle of the weak against the strong. The air was heavy with the breath of triumphant blooms and the odor of de- feated. decaying life. A thousand voiceless tragedies were being enacted; the wood was peopled by distorted shapes that spoke of forgotten encounters; rich, riotous, parasitic growths flourished upon starved limbs or rotting trunks. It was weird and beautiful and pitiless. Unlike the peaceful order of our northern forests, here was a savage riot, an unending treacherous war- fare without light or room or mercy. Tiring of the scene at last, Kirk con- tinued his wanderings, bearing gradually toward the right, that he might eventually emerge upon the savannas below, where he knew there was a good paved road lead- ing to the city. But the trails were devious and seemed to lead nowhere, so at last he struck out through the jungle itself. Hav- ing no machete with which to clear a way, his progress was slow, but he took his time, keeping a wary outlook for game, tw'sting back and forth to avoid the densest thick- ets, until he finally came out upon the mar- gin of a stream. Through the verdure be- yond it he saw the open, sunlit meadows, and he followed the bank in the hope of finding a foot log or a bridge upon which to cross. He had gone perhaps a hundred yards when he stumbled out into a cleared space, where he paused with an exclama- tion of surprise. The brook had been dammed and wid- ened into a deep, limpid pool to which the clean, white sand of the bottom lent a golden hue. At the lower end it over- flowed in a waterfall, whose purling music filled the glade. Overhead the great trees were arched together and interlaced, their lower branches set with flowering orchids, like hothouse plants upon a window ledge. The dense foliage allowed only a random beam of sunlight to pass through and pierce the pool, like a brilliant, quivering javelin. Long vines depended from the limbs above, falling sheer and straight as plumb-lines; a giant liana the size of a man’s body twined up and up until lost in the tangle over- head. Although set just w ithin the border of the untouched forest, it was evident that this spot had been carefully cut away and art- fully cultivated. It could be seen that no human artist had designed the wondrous stage effect; but man’s hand had aided Nature by a few deft touches here and there and a careful pruning of her lavish riches. To step suddenly out of an uncut wilderness into such a scene as this was bew ildering and made the American gasp with delight. The place had an air of strictest privacy. A springboard mirrored in the depths below- invited one to plunge, a pair of iron gym- nasium rings was swung by chains to a massive limb, a flight of stone steps led up the bank and into a hut artistically t hatched and walled with palm leaves to harmonize with its setting. Kirk thanked his fortune that he had not blundered in while the place w-as in use, for it had almost the sacred air of a lady’s boudoir.Everybody’s Magazine Instead of promptly withdrawing, he al- lowed his admiration full plav, and stood staring for a long time. What a delightful nook in which to dream away thc days! It was dim and cool and still, although outside its walls of green the afternoon sun was beating down fiercely. A stranger might pass and never guess its presence. It had been cunningly shaped by fairies, that was evident. Doubtless it was peopled by them also, and his mistake had been in coming upon it so suddenly. If he had approached with caution, he would surely have sur- prised them at their play, for yonder was the music of their dances—that chuckling, singing waterfall could serve no other pur- pose. Perhaps a fairy was hidden under it now. Kirk was half tempted to conceal himself and wait for it to reappear, though he knew that extraordinary cunning is re- quired to deceive wood sprites, once they have been alarmed. But undoubtedly they were somewhere close by, probably watching him from behind the leaves, and if they were not such timid creatures he might try to search them out. As it was, he took a lingering, farewell look and turned to retrace his steps—where- upon the queen fairy laughed at him softly. He paused abruptly, then turned around, with care, so as not to frighten her. But, of course, she was invisible. Then she spoke again, with the sweetest foreign accent imaginable. “ You had better cross upon the waterfall, sir. There is no bridge above.” After an instant, during which he strained his eyes to find her, she laughed again. “Here I am, in the tree, across the pond.” "Oh!” Looking at him over the fork of a tree trunk, perhaps twice the height of his head above the ground, Anthony behold a ravishing face and two very bright eyes. Without removing his gaze, he leaned his gun carefully against a bush—firearms have an abominable effect upon hama- dryads—and said: "I knew you were here all the time.” " Indeed! ” The eyes opened in astonish- ment. “You did not see me at all." “Of course; but I knew you were some- where close by. just the same. How did you get up there?” “I climbed up.” “Why didn't you hide under the waterfall?” “I did not hide, sefior. I am trying to reach my orchid.” A little hand appeared beside thc face, and a finger pointed to one of the big air- plants above. Kirk beheld a marvelous, white, dove-shaped flower, nodding upon a slender stalk. “I climbed up on the big vine; it is just like a ladder.” “Then you can’t be the queen!” Two very large, very dark eyes looked at him qucstioningly. “Queens don’t pick flowers,” he explained. “They hide in ’em.” “The queen?” “Some of them live in trees, and some preside over lakes and fountains. Which kind are you?” “Oh! I am neither. I live in my father’s house.” She tossed her head in the direc- tion of the savannas behind her. “ Do you wish to cross the stream?” “If you please.” “Wait.” The face disappeared. There was a sound from bellind the twisted tree trunk, a twig fell, then a piece of bark, and thc next instant the girl herself stepped into view. “I was afraid you'd gone for good,” acknowledged the young man gravely. He took up his gun and stepped out upon the crest of the dam. “You must look where you go," she ad- monished, “or you will fall—splash!” She laughed delightedly at the thought, and he saw that her eyes had a way of wrinkling almost shut in the merriest fashion. He bal- anced upon the slippery surface of the water- way with the stream up to his ankles. “Will you promise not to whisk yourself away if I look down?” he asked. “Yes.” But even with this assurance he found it difficult to remove his eyes from her dur- ing the brief instants necessary for a safe passage; and when at last he stood beside her. he felt an irresistible desire to seize her, gently, so that she could not escape. “Well?” she said at length, and he found he had been standing stock-still staring at her for several seconds. “ Excuse me! I really took you for a wood nymph. I'm not sure yet—you see, the place is so well suited. It—it was a natural mistake.” She dropped her eyes shyly and turned away at his look. “It is only our swimming-pool. There have been no fairies here since I was a veryThe Ne’er-Do-Well 355 little girl. But oncc upon a time there were many—oh. a great many." It is impossible to describe the odd. sweet sound her tongue gave to the English words. It was not a dialect, hardly an accent, just a delicious, hesitating mannerism born of unfamiliarity. "Did you ever see them?" “N-no. 1 arrived always a little too late. But there are such things.” He nodded. “Everybody knows that, since ‘Peter Pan.’" Another shy glance told her that he was still regarding her with his look of wondering admiration. She pointed to a path, saying: “This way will bring you to the road. sir. if you wish.” “But — I don’t wish — nut yet." He sought wildly for an excuse to stay, and exclaimed, "Oh, the orchid! I must get it for you." “That will be very nice of you, sir. For two years I have awaited its blooming. If you had not arrived, I would have got it anyhow." “Girls shouldn't climb trees," he said severely. “Tt tears their dresses.” “Oh, one cannot tear a dress like this." She glanced down at her skirt. Allowing his eyes to leave her face for a moment, Kirk saw that she was clad, oddly enough, in a suit of blue denim, which was buttoned snugly clear to her neck. It struck him as most inappropriate, yet it was extremely well made and he could not complain of the effect. He broke his gun and removed the shells, then, leaving it beside the bath house, went to the tree where he had first seen her. With one hand resting upon the trunk, he turned, to say: “Promise you won’t disappear while I'm tip there, nor change into a squirrel, or a bird, or anything like that." "What a fonny man you are!" “Do you promise?” “Yes. yes." “Do you live around here?” “Of course." "Why do you want this orchid?" "To put it in the house." Instead of beginning his climb, the young man lounged idly against the tree. "Funny how I found you, wasn’t it?" he remarked. "I mean it’s funny I should have stumbled right on you this wav— there's only one of you and one of me and er—this country is so big! I might have gone some other way and then perhaps we'd never have met.” He contemplated this contingency for an instant. “And if you hadn't spoken I'd never have seen you either.” “But I had to speak. You could not cross above." “Awfully nice of you. Some people would have let me go away.” “But the orchid, scflor. Do you fear to climb so high?” she inquired, with the faint- est gleam of amusement at his obvious effort to prolong the conversation. "Oh, no!” He cast about for something further to talk about, but, failing to find it, began slowly to clamber upward, supporting him- self upon the natural steps afforded by the twining vine and the protuberances of the trunk itself. When he had reached the first fork, he turned and seated himself comfortably, peering downward through the leaves for a sight of her. " Not gone yet! ” he exclaimed. "That’s good.” "Are you out of breath that you stop so soon?” He nodded. "I need to rest a minute. Say, my name is Anthony—Kirk Anthony.” Then, after a pause, “I'm an American.” "So am I—at least I am almost. My mother was an American." " You don't say!" The young man’s face lighted up with interest, and he started eagerly down the tree trunk, but she checked him promptly. “The orchid!" "Oh.yes!” He reseated himself. “Well, well, 1 suppose your mother taught you to speak English?” "I also attended school in Baltimore." Anthony dangled his legs from his perch and brushed aside a troublesome prickly pod that depended in such a position as to tickle his neck. "I'm from Yale. Ever been to New Haven? What are you laughing at?" “At you. Do you know what it is which you are fighting from your neck?" “This?” Kirk succeeded in locating the nettle that had annoyed him. "Yes. It is row-eetch. Wait! By and by you will scratch like everything." The young lady laughed with the most mis- chievous. elf-like enjoyment of this prospect. “All right; just for that, I will wait.” Now that the first surprise of meeting was over, Kirk began a really attentive scrutinyEverybody's Magazine of this delightful young person. So far lie had been conscious of little except her eyes, which had exercised a most remarkable effect upon him from the first. He had never cared for black eyes -they were too hard and sparkling, as a rule; but these— well, he had never seen anything quite like them. They were large and soft and vel- vety, like like black pansies! That was precisely what they were- saucy, wide- awake black pansies, the most beautiful llower in all creation; and while they were shadowed by the intangible melancholy of the tropics, they were also capable of twin- kling in the most roguish manner imagi- nable, as at the present moment. Her black hair was soft and line, entirely free from the harsh luster so common to that color, and it grew down upon her temples in a way that completed the perfect oval of her face. His first glimpse had told him she was ravish- ii.gly pretty, but it had failed to show how dainty and small she was. He saw now that she was considerably below the usual height, but so perfectly proportioned that one utterly lost perspective. Even her thick, coarse dress could not conceal the ex- quisite mold in which she was cast. Hut h r chief charm lay in a certain winsome vivacity, a willful waywardness, an ever- changing expression which showed her keenly alive. Even now, pure mischief looked out of her eyes as she asked: “Have you rested enough t<> attack the orchid?” •	Yes." He roused himself from hi- trance, and with a strangely leaping heart proceeded carefully to detach the big air-plant from its resting place. The wonderful flower nod- ding to his louch was no more perfect than this dryad whom he had surprised. "Don't break it." she cautioned as. he came gingerly down the tree. "It is what we call E-piritu Santo, the ‘Holy Spirit' llower. See. il is like a white bird." "First one I've seen,” he said, noting how the purity of the bloom enhanced the olive of her cheek. Then he began another fruit- less search for a topic of conversation, fear- ing that if he allowed the slightest pause she would send him away. Hut all his thoughts were of her. it seemed; his tongue would frame nothing but eager questions—all about herself. At last, in desperation, he volunteered to get another orchid; but the suggestion met with no approval. There w. re no more, she told him. of that kind. " Maybe we can find one," he said hope- fully. "Thank you. 1 know them all.” She was looking at him now as if wondering why he did not make a start, but wild horses could not have dragged him away. In- stead of picking up his gun, he inquired: "May I rest a moment? I'm awfully tired.” "Certainly. You may stay so long as you wish. When you are rested the little path will bring you out.” "But you mustn't go!" he exclaimed in a panic as she turned away. "Oh, 1 say, please! You wouldn't do a thing like that.” " I cannot speak to you this way, sir.” The young lady blushed prettily. "Why not, i'd like to know?" " ()h! ” She raised her hand and shook her head to express the absolute impossibility of such a thing. "Already I have been terrible. What will Stephanie say?" "You've been nothing of the sort, and who is Stephanie?" “She is a big black woman—very fierce. It is because of Stephanie that the fairies have gone away from here." •‘Ii we wait a minute, maybe they'll come out." "Xo. I have waited many times, and I never saw them.” "Somehow I feel sure we’ll see ’em this time.” he urged. Then, as she shook her head doubtfully: "Good heavens! Don’t you waul to see V. 1? I’m so tired that I must sit down.” The corners of her eyes wrinkled as she said," You are not very strong, sefior. Have you been ill?" “Yes--no. Not exactly." He led her to a bamboo bench beside the palm hut. ‘ I've been hunting. Now won't you please tell me how you chanced to be here? I thought these country places were unoccupied at this season." “So they arc. But. you see, I am doing a penance.” “Penance! You?” “Oh, yes. And it is nothing to laugh about either," she chided, as he smiled in- credulously "I am a bad girl; 1 am dis- obedient. Otherwise I would not allow you to speak to me alone like this. You are the first gentleman 1 have ever been so long in the company with, Senor Antonio." “Really?” " Now I will have to do more penance.” She sighed sadly, but her eyes were dancing.The Ne’er-Do-Well 357 "I don’t understand this penance affair. What do you do? " She lifted a fold of her coarse denim dress. “For six months 1 must wear these gar- ments—no pretty ones. 1 must not go out in public also, and 1 have been sent here away from the city for a time to cure my rebellious spirit." “Those dresses must be hot." "Oh, very uncomfortable! But, you see, I was bad." “Not very bad?” “Indeed! I disobeyed my father, my oncle, everybody." For the first time her eyes grew bright with anger. “ But 1 did not wish to be married." “Now I see. They wanted you to marry some fellow you don’t like." “I do like him-" "You did exactly right to refuse. By all means stand pat and don't-" “‘Stand pat’! I have not heard that word since I was in Baltimore.” “It's awful to marry somebody you don't like," he declared, with such earnest con- viction that she inquired quickly: "Ah, then are you married?” “No! But everybody says it’s positively criminal to marry without love." “The gentleman is very handsome." He shuddered. " Beware of handsome men. If you have any idea of marriage, select a large, plain-featured man with blue eyes and light hair.” "1 do not know such a person." "Not yet, of course; that is, not well enough to marry him." "It is not nice to speak of such things," said the young lady primly. “ Anri it is not nice also to speak with strange gentlemen who come out of the forest when one is doing penance. But 1 am a half-American, you know. Perhaps that is what makes me so bad.” "Will you catch it for talking to me?” "Oh. yes. It is not allowed. It is most improper." “Then I suppose I'd better leave." An- thony settled himself more comfortably upon the bench. " And yet there is nothing really wrong about it. is there? Why. it’s done every day in my country. Besides, who's going to know?" "The padre. I tell him everything." " You girls down here have a pretty tough time of it—you are guarded pretty closely, aren't you?" She gave him a puzzled look. " 1 mean you don’t have any liberty. You don't go out alone, or let fellows take you to lunch, or to the matinees, or anything like that?" Evidently the mere mention of such things was shocking. “Oh, seftor," she tried incredulously, “such terrible actions cannot be permitted even in your country. It is awful to think of!” “Nonsense! It's done every day.” “Here il would not do at all. One's people know best about such things. One must be careful at all times. But you Americans are so wicked!" “How does a fellow ever get acquainted with a girl down here? How does he get a chance to propose?” But this frank questioning on so sacred a topic was a little more than the young lady was prepared to meet, and for the moment confusion held her tongue-tied. "One's people attend to that, of course," she managed to say, at length, then changed the subject quickly. “Do you live in Panama?” she asked. " Yes. I work on the railroad, or will, in a few days." “You are so young for such authority. It must be very difficult to manage rail- roads.” “Well—I won't have to run thc whole works—at first. I’m beginning gradually, you know—one train at a time.” “That will be easier, of course. What did you say is your whole name?" “Kirk Anthony.” "Keerk! It has a fonny sound, has it not?” “I never noticed it. And yours?" "Do you speak Spanish?” She regarded him curiously. “Not a word." “My name is Chiquita.” He repeated it after her. “It's pretty. What is your last name?" “That is it. If I told you my first name you could not use it ; il would not be proper.” “It ought to be something like Ariel. That means ‘spirit of the air and water,’ 1 believe. Ariel Chiquita. No, they don’t go together. What are you laughing at?" “To see you scratch your neck.” Anthony became conscious of a growing sensation where the strange pod had ‘tan- gled against his skin, and realized that hi- had been rubbing the spot for some time.E very bod y’s M agazine You did nol know il was the cow-net tie, eh?” " You enjoy seeing me suffer," he said patiently. " You do not suffer,” she retorted, mimick- ing his tone. "You only eetch! You wish me to sympathize." “See here, Miss Chiquita, may I call on you?" "Oh!" She lifted her brows in amaze- ment. “Such ideas! Of a certainly not." “Why?" “You do not understand. Our young men do not do those things.” “Then I ’it do whatever is customary— really I will, but—I ’m awfully anxious to see you again—and-” "I do not know you My father--" "I'll look xip Mr. Chiquita and be in- troduced.'' At this the young lady began to rock back and forth in an abandon of merriment. The idea, it seemed, was too utterly ridiculous for words. Her silvery laughter tilled the glade. "No. no," she said finally. "It is im- possible. Besides, I am doing penance. I can see no one. In the city I cannot even sit upon the balcony." She fetched a pal- pably counterfeit sigh, which ended in a titter. Never had kirk beheld such a quaintly mischievous, such a madly tantalizing creature. "Say! You’re not really going to marry that fellow!” he exclaimed, with consider- able fervor. She shrugged her shoulders wearily. "I suppose so. One cannot forever say no. and there are many reasons-" “Oh. that's the limit! You'll go nutty, married to a chap you don’t care for.” "But 1 am naughty, now." "Not ‘naughty’—nutty. You'll be per- fectly miserable. There ought to be a law against it. Let me call and talk it over, at least. I know all about marriage I've been around so many married people. Promise?” " I cannot let you ’call.’ as you say. Be- sides. for two weeks yet I must remain here alone with Stephanie." She regarded him mournfully. “Every day I must do my penance, and think of my sins, and—perhaps look for orchids." He saw the light that flickered in the depths of her velvet eyes, and his heart pounded violently at the unspoken invi- tation. “To-morrow?” he inquired breathlessly. “ Do you intend to hunt orchids to-morrow?” Instead of answering, she started to her feet with a little cry, and he did likewise. Back of them had sounded an exclamation —it was more like the snort of a wild ani- mal than a spoken word -and there, ten feet away, stood a tall, copper-colored negress, her eyes blazing, her nostrils di- lated, a look of utmost fury upon her face. She was fully as tall as Kirk, gaunt, hook- nosed. and ferocious. About her head was bound a gaudy. Barbadian headdress that increased the wildness of her appearance. "Stephanie!" exclaimed the girl. "You frightened me.” The negress strode to her. speaking rap- idly in Spanish, then turned sharply upon Kirk. "What do you want here?" she cried menacingly. She had thrust her charge be- hind her and now pierced him with her eyes. "Miss Chiquita-” he began, at which that young lady broke into another peal of silvery laughter and chattered to her ser- vant. But her words, instead of placating the black woman, only added to her fury. She pointed with quivering hand to the path along the stream bank and cried: “ Go! Go quick, you man! ” Then to her charge. “ You bad. bad! Go to the house." “Miss Chiquita hasn't dune anything to make you huffy. I came out of the woods yonder and she was good enough to direct me to the road." But Stephanie was not to be appealed. She stamped her flat foot and repeated her command in so savage a tone that Kirk per- ceived the uselessness of trying to explain. He looked appealingly at the girl, but she merely nodded her head and mot: ;:ed him to be gone. Very well." he said regret:''.:".y. " Thank you for your assistance. Miss Chiquita."

It threatened to suffuse him, choke him. rob him of his senses: he wanted to cry out. Her name was Chiquita! He repeated it over and over in time to his steps. Was there ever such a beautiful name? Was there ever such a ravishing little wood sprite? And her sweet, hesitating accent that rang in his ears! How could human tongue make such caressing music of the harshest language on the globe? She had called him "Sefior Antonio.” and invited him to come again, to-morrow. Would he come? He doubted his ability to wait so long. Knowing that she agreed to the tryst, no power on earth could deter him. What a day it had been! He had started out in the morning, vaguely hoping to divert his mind with some of those trite little hap- penings that for lack of a better term we rail adventures, in this humdrum world. And then, with the miraculous, unbelievable luck of youth, he had stumbled plump into the middle of the most wondrous adventure it was possible to conceive. And yet this wasn’t adventure, after all—il was some- thing bigger, finer, more precious. With a suddenness that was blinding, he realized that he was in love! Yes. that was it. be- yond the shadow of a doubt. This mischief- ridden. foreign-born little creature was the one and only woman in the world for whom the Fates had made him. That evening he sat for a long time alone <•11 the gallery of his hotel, his spirit up- lifted with the joy of it, a thousand whisper- ing voices in his ears. And when at last he fell asleep, it was to dream of an olive, oval face with eyes like black pansies. CHAPTER NIY llll PATH THAI 1-1.1) NOWHERE When "Sefior Antonio" awoke the next morning, he lay for an instant striving to recall what it was that had haunted his sleeping hours, what great event awaited him. Then, as it rushed through his mind, he leaped out of bed and dashed headlong into the bath room. This was to-morrow! It had been ages in coming—he recalled lu>w even his slumbers had dragged -but it was here at last, and he would see .Miss Chiquita. He sang as he stepped under his shower. and whistled blithely as he dressed him- self. What a glorious country this Panama was anyhow! How good it was to b> young and to be in love! He never had been so happy. A man must surely be in love to sing before breakfast. Hut the after- noon was still a long way "IT. and he must be content to dream until the hour came. He was too early for the Cortlandts. s«' he breakfasted alone. When he strolled out upon the veranda for his smoke, he found Allan waiting for him. as usual. The Jamaican had not missed a morning so far, and it was only by a show of down- right firmness that Kirk had been able get rid of him at any time during the day. The black boy seemed bent upon devoting every waking hour to his hero, and now finding himself regarded with friendly eves, he expanded joyously. "Got you some games yesterday?" he inquired. "Yes. And I’m going again to-dav." “ Plenty games over yonder is. but it is very fatiguing to get them. To-day I go along for showing you the way." "Not a bit like it. I’m going alone." “Oh no, boss!” "Oh yes. boss! 1 accidentally shot the last man I hunted with—killed him." Kiri, stared tragically at his companion, but Allan was not to be so easily deterred. "I shall pahss behind you. boss.” "I’d love to have you, of course—but I'm too careless." "Praise God, you must not go h‘alone in that case, or something will befall you! 1 shall h'imitate the birds and call them out before you to lire at." "Fire at.' I don't lire at things- I hit 'em.” ' Yes sar. In that case we shall procure plenty of games.” "See here! I’m going alone, understand? 1 have an engagement with a naiad." " ’Ow much a month will you be getting for such h’engagements?” "Naiads don’t pay in money: they give you smiles and kind words." "Better you continue then as train col- lector. There is great h’opportunity f*>r stealing." "Mv job won’t be ready for a few days, and meanwhile I have become a huntsman. 1 intend to go out every afternoon." " H'afternoons is no good for wild h'animals: they are sleeping. Walk theyEverybody's Magazine in the h'carly morning, for the most part, very quietly.” “That’s true of some wood creatures, but the kind 1 hunt dance along the edges of pools in the afternoon. Say, did you ever feel like dancing?” “No sar.” “Come around on the back porch and I'll teach you a buck-step. I feel too good to sit still.” But Allan refused this proffer firmly. Such frivolous conduct was beneath his dignity. “I ’ave h’important things to disclose,” he said mysteriously. “ Indeed." “Yes sar. Lahst night I dreamed.” “You’ve got nothing on me; so did I.” “I was walking on the h’edge of the h’ocean, when I h’encountered a whale— a ’uge dead whale. It was very vivid.” “Well, what has a vivid, dead whale to do with me?” “This!” Allan brought forth a sheet of paper, which he unfolded carefully. “There is the number—the ‘tish number,’ sar.” He pointed at it triumphantly. “Why, this is a Chinese lottery adver- tisement.” “I got it for the very purpose. It would pay us to h’invest some money on the ‘fish number.’ ” “Nonsense! I don't believe in dreams. You say yourself they are false. Besides, I've got no money.” Allan folded the paper disconsolately and thrust it into his pocket. “It is fartunate h'indeed,” said he. “that you will be work- ing soon, Master H'Aunt’ony. And those P. R. R. was very fartunate also for getting you to h'accept a position, very fartunate h’indeed.” “Do you think I will raise the standard of efficiency?” “Most of those railroad persons are vile people. They threw me h’off the train with such violence that my joints is very stiff and h’inflamed. I should h'enjoy being boss over them for a while.” “Why don't you ask for a job?" “ I have decided to do so, and I am ask- ing you now for an h’engagement as brakes- man." “I can't hire you. Go to the office." “Probably there are h’already brakes- men on your train," Allan predicted gloomily. “I have no doubt.” “In that case I shall ride with you as private person.” “Ride back and forth every day.'" “Those are my h'expcctations, sar.” “That costs money.” “You will be collector,” remarked the negro calmly. “I should like to see those train people h'expel me in that case." "Well! I can see trouble ahead for one of us,” laughed Anthony. “They don't allow ‘deadheads.’ But Allan replied with unshaken con- fidence. “Then you should secure for me a pahss." Kirk found it extremely difficult to es- cape from his persistent shadow that after- noon. and he succeeded only after a display of armed resistance. It was the hottest part of the day when he set out, gun on arm; yet he did not think of the discom- fort. After skirting the city, he swung into the fine macadam road that had brought him home the night before, and much sooner than he expected he arrived at the little path that led into the forest. He knew that he was trespassing again, and the knowledge added to his delight. As quickly as possible he lost himself in the grateful shade and followed the stream bank with beating heart. He determined to make his love known without delay and establish himself as a regular suitor. As upon the previous day, he broke into the glade before he suspected its presence, to find the same golden light-bc-ams flicker- ing in the shadowed depths, and to hear the little waterfall chuckling at his sur- prise. There was the tree from which she had called to him. yonder the bench where they had sat together. Of course he was too early—he wanted to be, in order not to miss an instant of her company—so he seated himself and dreamed about her. The minutes dragged, the jungle drowsed. An hour passed. A thousand fresh, earthy odors breathed around him, and he began to see all sorts of flowers hidden away in unsuspected places. From the sunlit meadows outside came a sound of grazing herds; the deep woods faintly echoed the harsh calls of tropic birds, but at the pool itself a sleepy silence brooded. Once a chattering squirrel came bravely rustling through the branches to the very edge of the enchanted bower, but he only sat and stared a moment in seeming ad-Thc Ne’er-Do-Well miration, then retreated quietly. A yel- low-beaked toucan, in a flash of red and black and gold, settled upon a mirrored limb; but it, too, stilled its raucous tongue and flitted away on noiseless pinions as if thc naiads were asleep. In the moist earth beside the bench Anthony saw the print of a dainty boot, no longer than his palm, and he promptly fell into a rhapsody. What tiny hands and feet she had, to be sure, and such a sweetly melancholy face! Yet she was anything but grave and gloomy. Why, the sunlight dancing on that waterfall was no more mischievous and merry than she. The slight suggestion of sadness she conveyed was but the shadow of the tropic mystery, or thc afterglow of the tragedy that had played so large a part in this country’s his- tory. The fact that she was half American perhaps accounted for her daring, yet, whatever the other strain, it could not be ignoble. Mrs. Cortlandt’s figure of the silver threads in a rotting altar-cloth re- curred to him with peculiar force. But why didn’t she come? A sudden apprehension overtook him, which grew and grew as the afternoon wore away. It was a very miserable young man who wandered out through the fragrant path, as the first evening shadows settled, and bent his dejected steps toward thc city. Evidently something had occurred to pre- vent her keeping the tryst; but he deter- mined to return on the morrow, and then, it she did not come, to follow the path that led to the house, where he would risk everything for a word with her. He wondered if she had stayed away purposely to test him, and the thought gave him a thrill. If so, she would soon learn that he was in earnest; she would find him waiting there every afternoon and—after all, why confine himself to the afternoons, when she was just as likely to appear in the morning? He resolved to go hunting earlier here- after, and give the whole day to it. Mean- while, he would make cautious inquiries. It was considerably after dark when he reached the hotel, and his friends had dined; but he encountered Mr. Cortlandt later. If Edith’s husband suspected any- thing of what had occurred two nights before, his countenance gave no sign of it. I or some reason or other. Kirk had not been troubled in the slightest by the The Next Instalment of ‘‘The Ne’cr-Do thought that Cortlandt might be told. He could not imagine Edith’s making him the confidant of her outraged feelings. Be- sides, would such a strangely impassive person resent any little indiscretion in which his wife might choose to indulge? Kirk did not know -the man was a puzzle to him. Cortlandt's voice was thoroughly noncommital as he inquired: "Where have you been keeping yourself?” “I've been hunting, to kill time." “Any luck?” “No, none at all. I started too late, 1 guess.” “By the way," continued the other, “your friend Allan has been besieging Edith, imploring her to use her ‘h’influence’ to get him a position. He has set his heart upon going to work with you.” "He is becoming a positive nuisance. I can’t get rid of him.” “I never saw such hero-worship.” "Oh, all niggers are hysterical.” “Let me give you a bit of advice, An- thony. Remember there are no ‘niggers* and ‘whites’ in this country—they are about equal. The President of the Republic is a black man, and a very good one, too.” “ That reminds me. I hear he is to be suc- ceeded by the father of my friend. Alfarez.” Cortlandt hesitated. “General Alfarez is a candidate. He is a very strong man, but it isn’t settled by any means. Thc successful candidate will need the support of our Government.” “I suppose the Alfarez family is one of the first settlers—Mayflower stock?” “Oh, worse than that. The name runs back to Balboa's time. General Alfarez is very rich, and very proud of his ancestry. That is one thing that makes him so strong with the people." “What are some of the other leading families?” Kirk artfully inquired. “There arc a number. The Moras, the Garavels—I couldn't name them all. They are very fine people, too.” “Do you know thc Chiquitas?” Cortlandt’s face relaxed in an involun- tary smile. "There is no such family. Who has been teaching you Spanish?” "Really, isn’t there?” “‘Chiquita’ means ‘very small.’ ‘little one,’ ‘little girl.’ or something like that. It’s not a family name; it's a term of en dearmcnt, usually." -Well” will appear ia thc April NumVer.n^he PASSING OF THE IDLE RICH by Frederick Townsend Martin P/Jitrtri NntP r' ■^ar,,lt t"1' been " thoughtful observer of conditions outside of, os well as within, the doss of which he specially writes. The prime value of his material in these articles lies in his revelation of what is going on in the homes and in the dubs and in the minds of the rich, lie tells us that friends of his are reading socialistic books and magazines, sending their children to the public schools, discussing the great movements in social, industrial, and politieal life. The rapid growth of American industry and Ameri- can idleness side by side, the one in large measure a direct result of the other, is presented from a point of view that will help to interpret the very rich to all of us. CI I A I* T J; R 111 C O N TIX U E D I REMEMBER very well the first gre.it inarch of the suddenly rich upon the social capitals of the nation of those who had gathered from the mines of Cali- fornia, from the forges of Pittsburg, from the forests of Michigan, from the metaled moun- tains of Montana, wealth beyond I he dreams of Midas. They had capitalized the prod- ucts of their own labor, and brought with them the tangible evidences of wealth in the shape of stocks and bonds. Very distinctly it comes back to me with what a shock the fact struck the sons and daughters of what was pleased to call itself the aristocracy of America that here inarched an army better provisioned, better armed with wealth, than any other army that had ever assaulted the citadels of society. The effect of these migrations from the fields of labor to the cities of capital I shall sketch more fully in another chapter. 1 would now, instead, touch upon the condi- tions that they left behind them, the con- ditions that made possible their own retire- ment from actual labor to the ease and comfort of luxurious leisure. It is not loo much to say that they left behind them a people reduced to industrial slavery. Gone forever was the free America our fathers knew. Faded into history was the ideal of Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln. From the year 1S90 onward the progress of the United Slates has been the fearful march of manufacturing industry. In that year, the products of industry and of agriculture were about equal. Ten yearsThe Passing of the Idle Rich later, the products of industry were two to one against the wealth gathered from the fields. Side by side with this conquest of Amer- ica went the growth of tenant farming, as against the old free-lenure farming that had marched steadily into the farthest un- tilled corners of the land so long as land was free. To-day there is no free land within the borders of the nation, save for a few small tracts hardly worth mentioning. Here, as in the industries, capital did not hesitate to claim and capture all that it dared. Law after law was passed to pre- vent the centralization of the power of ex- ploiters over great tracts of the West. Law after law was broken, evaded, or laughed at. Once the spirit of exploitation on a large scale was abroad in the land, nothing could stand against it. In the days of individual effort, exploi- tation of labor was not possible, for men shied off from the chains of the exploiter, took to the boundless free fields of the West, and declared that they would dwell in freedom or they would die. Hut in the census of 1900, it is shown clearly that the average employee in this country produces aery year $1,280 0/ 'wealth, after full allowance for the cost of the material he works with and all possible running expenses that are paid by his em- ployer. Out of this amount of 'wealth, he gets $437. The remainder, $843, goes into the hands of other men—the capitalist, or the exploiter of labor. That money, nearly two thirds of the wealth produced by the men who labor with their hands and heads, goes to pay interest and dividends on the securities that represent the increment gathered by those who sold out. in other days, or who capitalized their plants and settled down to draw their sustenance from the labor ot other men. Hence the idle rich. TILE HANDWRITING ON THE WALL Turn back to the industrial history of the second half of the nineteenth century, and you can trace this development in the very statistics of industry. For the idle rich are but the outcome of our industrial evolution; and the same mighty forces that gave us a Golden Age of American prosperity gave us also the Idle Rich and the Slaves of Industry. By the end of that period, the handwriting on t he wall was plainly visible. For instance, in 1S40 there were in this country 1.240 cot- ton manufacturing plants, with a combined gross output of S4O.000.000 worth of goods. Each plant made $37,000 worth of goods. Twenty years later, the number of plants was 1.001, and the output was Si 15,000.000. Each plant made $105,000 worth of goods. THE SEEDS OK REVOLUTION Our fathers saw these figures; but it is not on record that an}’ man, at that time, saw their true meaning. It was simply, to their minds, the working out of the factory system lo its completion. It meant econ- omy. It was part of the same system that had reduced the cost of making a yard ot broadcloth from fifty cents in 1S23 to fif- teen cents in 1840. They could not, naturally, see in it, aa we can. the seeds of a revolution that was to make over again the America of that day, to drag the boasted freedom of Amer- ica in the mire of poverty, to prostitute our political system, to tear and wreck and sweep away the sacred barriers of society. I have compiled a table from the census reports, dealing with textile industries alone, because that branch of manufac- turing was the oldest and one of the great- est, as it is to-day, and because it illus- trates perhaps belter than any other the progress of principles, rather than the influ- ence of special causes, particularly through this twenty-year period of which I am writing. Year TEXTILE INDUSTRIES OF U. S. No. of Average Product Av.

The number of plants, in- stead of increasing as the volume of demand for products increased, was contracted. The leadership of the trade, and therefore the making of prices, was taken by the houses of larger capital. The average capi- tal employed in the trade doubled in the twenty years. The output also doubled, for the average factory. The number of employees, on the other hand, increasedEverybody’s Magazine but half. Better machinery, more efficient control over the workers, more drastic mduslri.il discipline, fiercer industrial com- petition for individual work, did their des- tiny-appointed task. Here one begins to see on this broad can- vas. but faint in outline, the tracing of the picture of America to-day. The chains began to tighten. Men who had grown to comfortable wealth in the long period of small factories, scattered industries, and free-and-easy industrial democracy, began to gather together into industrial groups. Little industries were rolled together into big industries. The capital of the factory expanded, doubling, on an average, in thc decade. At thc same time, by more intense methods of carrying on the trades, the number of employees needed to produce a given value of products was cut down. Let me turn, for a moment, to introduce a slight record of that industry which has done more, perhaps, than any other to bring about the creation of the class of which 1 write—the idle rich. I have not dwelt upon it in the beginnings of American industry, for it was scarcely existent. I refer to the iron and steel industry. In 1S60 there were in this country only .(02 plants manufacturing wrought, forged, and rolled iron. They used an average of $5S,oco of capital apiece, produced prod- ucts worth $91,000 each, and employed an average of 55 men. In 18S0—twenty years later—there were 1,005 iron and steel plants—including blast furnaces and rolling mills—with an average capital of $230,000, average products of $296,000, and an average roll of 141 men. Here the evolution of an industry from the small scattered plants to the concentrated, efficient, and powerful "combine” is unmistakable. In this twen- ty-year period the value of products treb- led. while the average number of workers more than doubled. The wealth-producing capacity of each worker increased from $1,438 to $2,015. If the tendency toward monopoly was striking in the twenty years from 1800 to 1880, what may one say of the twenty years that followed? In the iron and steel trade, thc 1,005 plants of 18S0, with an aver- age production of $296,000 each, became 668. with an average production of $1,203,- 500 in 1900. The average number of em- ployees per plant rose from 141 to 333. In the cotton mills, the average number of employees in each mill rose during the same period from 1S5 to 2S7. Here is the birthplace of the idle rich. Hundreds of men who had owned small manufacturing plants sold them out at good profits in the first ten years of this era and retired to live on the proceeds. The firm gave way to the corporation. Industries that had been for generations family affairs were suddenly capitalized in the form of stocks and bonds, and the own- ers retired from the active business, hiring skilled men to carry on the work. They themselves sat down in ease and luxury, to live upon interest and dividends on the securities that represented the plants. I do not mean to say that, even now, by any means all of the dividends and interest are gat hered by the idle rich. Such a condi- tion as that can exist but once in the history of a nation. Il came about in Rome—and it led to thc Fall. It came about in France —and it led to theTerror. Here, in America, il	has gone far, to be sure, and the tendency is onward: but it has not yet reached a point where one may say, "To-morrow the har- vest is ripe.” CHAPTER IV WHO ARE THE SLAVES? For thirty years, since 1SS0, we have been piling up wealth in the hands of men who do not work. In almost every year there has been pouring from our mills a steady grist of idlers. It has gone so far that to-day in every city of the Union thc class of the idle rich has reached pro- portions that to the thoughtful student of events are alarming. I do not desire to criticise wealth; for 1 am not a Socialist and I entertain no Uto- pian dreams concerning the equal distribu- tion of wealth among the people, or the pub- lic control of all sources of wealth. I agree thoroughly with Mr. Carnegie, and with much older economists, in the opinion that any arbitrary distribution of wealth, or any arbitrary assignment of thc sources of wealth, would be but temporary, and would be followed by another period of ad- justment which would end with the reap- propriation of wealth and the reassignment of the sources of wealth into the hands best qualified by nature to hold them. I take it to be proven by the experience of theThe Passing of the Idle Rich 365 world that individual exploitation of the sources of wealth remains as the estab- lished basis of the industrial, commercial, and social development of the world. Vet, I confess, the terriiic sweep of indus- trialism across this land throughout the past half century appalls me as 1 study it from records written and unwritten. I can- not go down through the crowded tene- ment sections of our great cities without having it borne in upon me that we as a nation pay a fearful price in human blood and tears for our industrial triumphs. 1 cannot sec the poverty, even the degrada- tion, of the wives and children of the wage- working class in many cities, and even in many rural districts, without being visited by the devastating thought that surely, if the principle of the thing be necessary and right, there must be fearful errors some- where in the application of the principle. For the grim fact stands out beyond denial that the men who are the workers of the nation, and the women and the chil- dren dependent upon them, are not to-day given the opportunities that are their proper birthright in free America; and that, struggle as they will, save as they may, lilt their voices in protest as they dare, they cannot obtain from our industrial hierarchy much more than a mere living wage. And, on the other hand, it is equally true that the wage of capital is high, that the class of the idle rich lias grown out of all proportion, and that it has taken upon itself a power and an arrogance unsur- passed in the industrial history of the world. OCR WORKMEN AND Till;IK WAGES Somewhere, there is something wrong. I speak as a rich man. I speak as a repre- sentative of the class of which I write, and to which in particular I address myself. We can no longer blind ourselves with idle phrases nor drug our consciences with the outworn boast that the workingman of America is to-day the highest paid artisan in the world. We know those lying figures well. Many a time I myself, in personal argument, have shown that the American workman receives from one and a half to three times as much as his English cousin at the same trade; but we know now that this means nothing. We arc learning, in- stead of envying the American workingman his lot. to pity more deeply that English cousin. We are learning, too, that what we give our workers in wages we take back from them in the higher cost of necessities, in food, in clothing, in medicine, in insur- ance. in a hundred devious ways all with one tendency—to keep the living margin down. OUR UNENCIIA1NED SLAVES Many centuries ago two great Greek philosophers. Aristotle and Plato, pre- dicted that the time would come when the tools of wealth production machinery— would have reached such an advanced sta-je of development that it would become unnecessary to enslave anybody for the sake of allowing any one class to devote itself to the pursuit of culture. These great philosophers believed in slavery during that period of the world's development in which they lived, on the ground that only by the exploitation of forced labor could any class be left free to develop the higher attributes of mankind. Vet both looked forward to the time when, in the progress of humanity toward the ideal, the per- fection of methods would permit the eman- cipation of all mankind. Aristotle and Plato were no visionaries. Their dreams, so far as the methods are concerned, are to-day realities; but alas, how different the result! Instead of eman- cipation. we have welded about the necks of the people the chains of industrial slav- ery. It is true that the form of slavery, the direct exploitation of the bodies of men, h.is been wiped out in every civilized na- tion. Hut is it not equally true that we have merely stepped out of a process of direct exploitation of a few enchained slaves into a process far more expansive and em- bracing far more people, namely, the indi- rect exploitation of wage-workers for the benefit of capital? The fruit of the genius of the inventors of the world is plucked, not by the hands of the workers, but by the hands of the com- paratively small and personally insignifi- cant class who, by virtue of the genius of their fathers, or by virtue of mere chance, administer the tremendous power of capital. The evolution of the ages, then, has brought about this strangely ironical condi- tion. Humanity is face to face with a God- given opportunity to acquire and apply366 Everybody’s Magazine knowledge. The wealth-producing ma- chinery of the world has the capacity to give to all men the opportunity of enjoy- ing leisure. Knowledge and culture are the proper birthright of humanity to-day. Even in the face of obstacles, knowledge and culture spread among the people. Only one great obstacle remains to block the fulfillment of the prophecy of the great philosophers. That obstacle is the idle rich. It is the leisure class that to-day destroys the spirit of our dream. It cannot be for long. We in America are moving fast toward social revolution. Conflicts between Labor and Capital are assuming the pro]X>rtions of civil war. The once powerful middle class, which is the safety of every nation, is to-day weak, and is every day declining. Soon, politically, it will be a memory, and the battlefield will be cleared for conflict. CHAPTER V TIIE AWAKENING OK SOCIETY I was dining recently in one of the city hotels. Music and laughter flooded the place as sunshine floods the fields. Out- wardly, the scene had all the appearance of perfect ease and happiness. Looking around, I lighted by chance upon a table where a group of elderly people, all well known to me, were dining. They were people who live well, and who take a large part in the social world as well as in the world of business. I watched them as they talked. I noted an air of gravity, of seri- ousness, and I wondered what it was all about. A little later, as their table as- sumed the normal aspect, I went over and exchanged greetings with them. Inciden- tally, I asked them what had made them so very serious throughout the evening. One of them, an old friend of mine, told me. They had been discussing a statement that had appeared as a news item during the afternoon. It was part of a speech made in the Senate at Washington. It was an attack upon the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few—really a veiled denunciation of the principle upon which society is founded. These men and women, all part and parcel of the social world, had spent most of their evening discussing that item of news. A very few years ago such an episode as this would have been dismissed, with hardly a single thought, by almost any group of men and women who belonged to society. Somebody might have introduced the subject; somebody else would have called the senator a demagogue, or an agitator, or a Socialist—and the conversa- tion would have drifted on to the latest sporting news or talk of somebody's ball a month or so away. But now, the older men and women of society know better. They have learned, in fact, to distinguish real news from mere sensation. I do not say that it is general, this ten- dency to take seriously the social, industrial, and economic questions of the day. In mv own case, I do know that until a very few years ago none of these problems bothered me much. I know that very rarely did I hear the question raised as to the permanence of the conditions under which we lived within our social barriers. Nobody, in my world, considered the prob- lem of industry his own; and every one drifted onward through the years secure in the conviction that in the end every- thing was going to be all right. To-day, how different it is! To-day we are studying the sources of our wealth, finding out for ourselves the real price paid by humanity to give us the privileges of the social life which we and our fathers have enjoyed. Excited by curiosity, we go down to inspect the mines our fathers left to us. We watch the men at work, mere pitiful animals, risking their lives in terrible en- deavor for a meager wage, that we, the heirs of time and of eternity, may take our leisure in the palaces of wealth. In the mills of Pittsburg we watch the workers in iron and steel, toiling in the white-hot blast of the furnaces that we, who never have toiled, may draw our dividends and spend them on the luxuries we love. THE WEALTHY CRAVE THE PEOPLE'S PRAISE But a very few years ago we should have looked upon these workers with eyes of pity, perhaps, and we might have talked more or less glibly of the hardships of labor. Yet it would not have been our problem. To-day we recognize the relationship be- tween the labor that produces our wealth and the wealth which we enjoy. Many are the causes that have led to this great change in the attitude of theThc Passing of thc Idle Rich wealthy classes toward the world at large. First and foremost, in my judgment, is the change in the attitude of the working classes themselves toward the rich. For, more assiduously than anything else in this world, we, the wealthy, seek the praise and admiration of the crowd. And the attitude of the people at large toward the rich has been changed indeed. 1 remember, even in my own lifetime, a period when the people of this country looked up with admiration and respect to their wealthy classes. Il was in the end of that long period of which 1 have spoken in which the wealth of the nation was well distributed. To-day how great the change—how won- derful the transformation! At first a few weak voices told what a few eves saw. In unheard-of journals of the labor move- ment, in certain revelations of high-finance corruption of politics, dreadful tales were told — stories long since forgotten. In Henry Demarest Lloyd's "Wealth vs. Commonwealth" we have a strong voice describing what keen eyes clearly discerned. Soon several profound historical studies were published which aroused thc more thoughtful. Then, with drum and trumpet and black banners flying, came the army of thc muck-rakers. And their revelations made the nation heartsick. TJ!F. MVCK-RAKKRS’ ONSLAUGHT Never in thc history of the world lias there been anything analogous to the sharp campaign of the American muck-rakers. The progressive forces of French society raged at the Monarchy and the Church before the French Revolution. But their propaganda took thirty years to gain power and fifty years to accomplish its purpose. The work of destruction here seemed to be done in a night. The "Pillars of Society” tumbled. From official statements of the President of the United States down to thc output of tcn-dollar-a-wcek hack-writers, our publications teemed with the products of the popular trade of exposure. Great commercial and industrial institutions were analyzed. National and municipal govern- ments were dissected. Universities and churches did not escape the busy seeker for sin. It is but five years since thc white light of the noonday sun beat down upon the hitherto deeply buried roots of America’s industrial and social life, and eighty-five millions learned henv the social fruitage of our age draws its sustenance. Just what, in this connection, has been the effect of these five years upon American opinion? When the nineteenth century closed, America worshiped great wealth. It sanc- tified its possessors. It deified the hundred- millionaire. In live years’ time America has learned to hate great wealth. Plu- tocracy is disgorging; but public opinion is relentless. WRITHING UNDER PI BMC SCORN To us who, through the heyday of our popularity, simply sat in the sunshine and throve and grew fat in happiness, it came as a terrible shock—this change of the popular attitude. At lirst we laughed at il; then we preached little sermons about it, half jesting, half serious; then we began to talk aboul it among ourselves; and we held indignation meetings every time we met our friends, and called down the wrath of Heaven on these sharp-eyed and glib- tongifcd investigators. Finally— and here lies the heart of the matter- we began to read these outpourings of the popular senti- ment very seriously indeed. They came, at last, from sources that we dared not disre- gard. Instead of mer ■ muck-raking expe- ditions they assumed [the proportions [of crusades. Instead of the frantic mouth- ings of mere sensation-mongers there con- fronted us, in the columns of the press and in the more sedate and orderly pages of the magazines, the speeches of a President, or sane, sober editorials written by men who knew both sides, and who commanded our respect as well as the respect and admira- tion of the crowd. We recognized—those of us who thought and saw and felt—that, instead of beinga passing phase, this change of popular sentiment was the beginning of a revolution. I hesitate to say how deep this arrow struck. Perhaps I can illustrate it best by telling a story that came to my ears this past winter. A lady of the old school was sending her daughter, a young girl, to one of the preparatory schools here in thc East. She went herself to look at the college and to talk with some of the professors. In conversation with the principal, she said: " I want Estelle, right from the beginningE very bod y ’ s M agazi ne of her course, to get a full understanding of where wealth comes from. I want her year by year to learn of the debt and the responsibility that she. personally, owes to the people that work. Are these things taught in your courses?” The principal was astounded. She pro- tested that such education was entirely out of line with the principles and precepts of that college. Very delicately and tactfully she intimated that one of the foundations .if a social education was the constant in- stillation into the students’ minds of the idea that the aristocracy is superior to the masses. To teach Estelle that she and her class are really dependent upon the grimy men who labor with their hands would be to turn upside down the curricu- lum of that college. The upshot of it was that Estelle to-day is enrolled as a student in a high school in New York City. Her mother believes that the salvation of the wealthy classes in this country depends upon the coming genera- tion's understanding the true relationship between Capital and Labor. OUR BEST-HATED CLASS This is. perhaps, an extreme case, for only a very few years ago that matron her- self was absolutely immersed in the whirl- l>ools of the most frivolous society which has a real right to use the term in talking about itself. Always, she was a woman of a most active mind, of broad sympathies, of excellent benevolent character; but her mind found its full exercise in the pursuit of social fads, her sympathies found outlet in sporadic raids upon the strongholds of misery and poverty, and her benevolence sat- isfied itself with much hidden largess to vari- ous and sundry charities. She did not really understand any of the problems of the day. The first awakening of this one woman came about through chance. Bored to death at a summer resort, half sick, ami therefore restricted in her activities, she picked up a book that a friend who had stopped on the piazza to extend her sympathies happened to leave. She began, half absently, to turn the pages, from back to front, as one will. A heading caught her eye. Here it is: OTR BARBARIANS FROM ABOVt. She did not understand it ; and her habit of mind led her to investigate. She had lost the page, but she searched until she found it. Then she read the paragraph: If our civilization is destroyed, as Macaulay predicted, it will not be by his barbarians from lie- low. Our barbarians come from above. Our great money-makers have sprung in one generation into scats of power kings do not know. The forces ami the wealth arc new, and have been the opportunity of new men. Without restraints of culture, experi- ence. the pride, or even the inherited caution of class or rank, these men. intoxicated, think they are the wave instead of the float. To them, science is but a never-ending repertoire of investments stored up by nature (or the syndicates, government but a fountain of franchises, the nations but cus- tomers in squads, and the million the unit of a new arithmetic of wealth written for them. She read on and on. She finished the book, and turned back to its beginning. She had read enough to realize her pro- found ignorance. That night, at dinner, she astounded her husband by asking: “ Who is Henry Demarest Lloyd?” "He is a Socialist writer," was the an- swer, “who amuses himself attacking our class.” "1 wish,” she said, "you would get me all his books.” From that time on. her mind found new occupations, new interests, new ideas. A world that she did not know existed came swiftly over her horizon. She did not rush madly into extremes—she has not to this day—but her life has changed considerably. We, who knew her so little time ago as one of the typical, clever, brilliant, and flashy purveyors of cheer and social joy, find her to-day no less charming in the matter of mere entertainment; but we expect, when we meet her. to find in her mind many other and more serious things. She never appears in print, she is not a suffragist, she has dropped her little fads. She is not that strange abnormality of her sex that neglects the old pursuits of women to follow the strange gods of men; but she is, in every >ense, a student of the true conditions that surround her. The mists of golden tradi- tion have cleared from her eyes. To-day, she has plenty of company in her own set. She did not convert them. She detests the role of propagandist. They simply came of their own accord to read and learn. And when the educated classes really become interested, 1 think they study things more deeply than any other class. Even the most violent and anarchistic of the publications that pretend to portray the facts of the class relation-The Passing of the Idle Rich ships have thousands of readers among the very wealthy. I remember a case in point. Mr. Upton Sinclair was invited to lunch, one day, by a mutual acquaintance, with a young man of the most exclusive set in New York. They met in a private dining-room at the Lawyers’ Club. In the course of the lunch, Mr. Sinclair referred to an article he had published in Wilshire’s Magazine, a So- cialist sheet of the noisy class. “Yes,” said the other, “I read it." “You read it!” exclaimed Mr. Sinclair, in complete surprise. “Oh, yes—I always read it," said the other, in a matter-of-fact way. There are many like him. Five years ago, you probably could have counted on the fingers of two hands the men in the wealthy classes who read the literature that comes from “below.” To-day it is a very common occurrence to hear in the best clubs of New York wealthy men discussing, with intense earnestness and real economic sense, articles of which they never would have heard five years ago. “I used to think,” said a clubman to me last winter, “that we were well beloved; but I guess our class is the best hated class in the land. I am only beginning to find out why.” Yet I have failed of my aim if I have given the impression that society is to-day wholly roused. This is. alas, not true. To-day, perchance, the vast majority of the men of wealth in this and other cities will call me a visionary and an alarmist. I wish it were true. Would that I could bring myself to believe that the things I see about me are but the passing phases of a natural adjustment. I have tried, for many years, to persuade myself that all is well. I have failed. CHAPTER VI FOR THIRTY PIECES OF S1LVKK I HAVE shown how the seed of our social system, which has reached its fine flower in the idle rich, was planted in the too fer- tile soil of American industry. I have dwelt, briefly, upon the simple fact that we of the older orders have come to find out something about that planting, and the manner of the growth. I turn with something like dismay to the methods of culture of this growth. For it is watered with the bloody sweat of labor and the salt tears of bitter poverty and suffering; and it is fertilized with the dead bodies of men and women outworn in the grim battle of life. Tended and watched it is by a foul horde of underlings, hired judges in the law, panders in politics, time servers in the pulpit, lickspittles in college chancellories, Judases in the press, black mailers in business, and miserable, fawn- ing parasites clinging like filthy leeches upon the administrative bodies of the nation. Till. BF.TRAYAI. OF THK NATION To mv mind, as I have studied this ques- tion. there has come a sad conviction: This nation is betrayed. The planting of the seed was quite possible without any be- trayal of the people. Even its growth for two decades was possible without delib- erate betrayal. But can any thinking mar. dare to say that the growth of this system as it has developed since 1890, could have- been possible without criminal negligence on the part of those public servants sworn to guard the true and lawful interests of Un- people of this nation? For it was perfectly evident, years ago. that the industrial evolution of this coun- try was a process of exploitation. It was the knowledge of this fact that lay behind the Sherman Law of 1890; and behind the Interstate Commerce Act, which sought to restrain, to a limited extent at least, the boundless license to plunder which had been taken unto themselves by the rail- roads. No man of broad and open mind cai read the facts with regard to the Home stead strike, the Pullman strike, the war in the Cccur d’Alene, or the coal strike ol very recent years, without coming to the conclusion that, no matter who was in the wrong in the immediate circumstances leading to those national catastrophes, the real underlying cause was a revolt on the part of a subjugated people against the hardships of industrial slavery. What is it, then, that makes possible the continuance of this process of exploitation in the face of the ever-growing publit knowledge of its existence? The answer is our public shame. For the simple reason is that the one power in th< world which could stop it—the will of the370 Everybody’s Magazine American people—has been turned from its purpose, defeated in its honest efforts, and betrayed in its administration, through the power of mobilized wealth restraining the hands of our political parties. To-day, in \mcrica, the people elect their statesmen; but the cxerciseof the people's power through these statesmen is curbed, directed, and con- trolled by groups of moneyed interests. America, then, is a plutocracy. Always, politically, the power of a plu- tocracy depends upon the maintenance of the status quo. It has come into being through the operation of certain industrial or commercial conditions. It lives by vir- tue of thc continuance of those conditions, and by virtue of their freedom from attack by the one power strong enough to destroy them, namely, the people. To maintain this status quo has been the gigantic task successfully carried out by the financial interests of the United States. It is not my intention—indeed, it is not within my power—to go into any complete details of the methods and machinery used for this end. But let me say that it has not all been accomplished, by any means, through direct political corruption, though much of it has been accomplished in that way. Deeper than this has been the indirect subornation of public opinion through a subsidized press, subsidized pulpits, and subsidized public speakers. We have heard a great deal of demagogues and wicked socialistic leaders of the mob. We do not hear much of that other phenomenon, thc oily sycophant who talks to the people with words of cheer and paragraphs of exhortation, having in his mind always the one single idea how best he may serve the moneyed interests that stand behind him. THE SOLID WEST It is strange to me, and it has always been strange to other men who have studied these things, that the interests of a plutoc- racy can be so long maintained, for a plu- tocracy, of its very nature, is thc weakest possible form of government. It lives either by force or by fraud. It lived in Rome before the days of Marius by force alone; and the lower orders of Rome were slaves. It lived in Paris, before the Terror, by a combination of force and fraud; and the lower orders of France became fiendish brutes. It lives in America by fraud alone; and what may we .say of the people of this nation who permit it to live? But the people are stirring. Not yet in definite organization — but stirring. The line of political cleavage along which the mighty rift must be made has not yet been clearly marked out. Perhaps one may find the first faint tracing of it in the rise of the insurgents in the last session of Congress. From what 1 have learned of the sentiment in the powerful Middle West, which more than any other part of the Union represents an average of the people of the United States, I am more than half convinced that this is true. If it be so, many things may happen within the next few years, and there may be very good reason indeed for the widespread uneasiness in the plutocracy. CHAPTER VII THE TRIBUNE OK THE PEOPLE Sometimes an honest man of my class, reading the news of the day, awakes to a sudden realization of the grim political truth. During the time of the public dis- cussion over the late tariff readjustment, I remember such an incident. We were three men, sitting together in the smoking-room of an uptown club. One of us had brought in a copy of a sane and honest afternoon paper, containing a quiet, dignified, careful, but powerful analysis of the actual results brought about under the tariff reform meas- ure. Wc had been struck by the article. We called it to the attention of the third member of the group. He read it through, while my friend and I talked about trivial things. After quite a long period of silence, he handed the paper back to thc giver. “ What do you think of it?” he was asked. His cigar had gone out. He lit it l>efore he replied. Then he said, gravely: America needs a Marius, a Pitt, and a Peel. Before long, it must get one or all of them, or it will surely breed a Danton and a Robespierre.” It may have been mere epigram; but the two of us who heard it were startled. For the man who said it was a leader of the world of fashion, powerful in the world of business, and descended from four genera- tions of the purest-blooded aristocracy this country owns. Think, then, of the meaning of this senti-The Passing of the Idle Rich nu-nt. from such a man, at such a time. Marius, a plebeian, led the slaves ol Rome to the scats of political power, broke down the age-old barriers of an aristocratic plu- tocracy. and wrote into the history of the world one of its earliest chapters on the revolt of a subjugated nation held in chains lor the benefit of a few. Pitt, Lord Chat- ham. the ‘‘Great Commoner,” hurled from office by the combined power of a king, a plutocratic class, and a subservient political machine, was forced back into office by the will of the people, unorganized, in the face of all the banded powers against him, and in spite of a condition of political corruption that made his return seem a miracle. Peel gave the people of England free corn against the banded powers of commercial greed. And to-day, in America, an aristocrat and a member of the plutocratic class, silting in a great city club of fashion, reading an editorial from a paper that is published and edited to meet the demands of that very class, gives it as his opinion that in this country we must raise a Marius, a Pitt, and a Peel: And the alternative—the days of (he Terror, the bloody bands, the brutish mob, the wild-eyed, frantic leaders of the host that stormed the Bastille, set up the guillotine—so runs the mind of an aristo- crat and a plutocrat, reading the Evening Post in a rich man’s club on upper Fifth Avenue! FACE THE TRl TIl! I believe that he was right. Without re- ferring specifically to the tariff reform—for this is no political document that I am writing—I believe that the catalogue of enactments by our legislative machine in the past twenty years reveals beyond the shadow of a doubt that the will oi the people is subservient to the will of the plu- tocracy. How can we further blind our- scives to the truth? When such a fact is known as gospel to the people, from Maine t > California, published in every section of the press, from the guttersnipe class to the s. liolarlv review, how may the best educated class in the United States go on upon its careless way ignoring the fact? The result is perfectly obvious, in the iight of history. The plutocracy, stripped of the artificial screens behind which it grew to power, stands exposed to-day in the full glare of the searchlight of public knowledge. Under such circumstances, even in slave- holding nations, there has never lacked a tribune of the people. So sprang thi Gracchi from the dust to lead the first great battle in Rome. So, even in the dawn of popular liberty, came a Tyler and a Cade; before their hour had struck it is true, yet. even so, with power to call to their back- armies of men willing to die and conquera- ble only by accident or guile. So in the fullness of time came other greater men. a Marius, a Pitt, a Peel, who led the people against the citadels of plutocracy. AMERICA—A LESSON TO THE NATIONS To-day, we of the class that rules, that draws unearned profits from the toil of other men, know full well that the time is almost here when there must be a true accounting. The fortunes that have been made are made and that is all of it. The fortunes that are in the making through misuse of politic;., power, through extortionate exploitation of the people and the people’s heritage, through industrial oppression and industrial deni;*! of the rights of man—these must be checked. To-morrow, in this land, the door of oppor- tunity must be again unsealed. We cannot go back and create more free land to take the place of the millions upon millions of acres thrown away by a lavish, stupid, careless, traitorous government. \\r«- cannot fill again the plundered mines of Michigan, or Montana, or Pennsylvania. We cannot clothe the hills of Maine and Michigan again with pine, or the broad bottoms of Ohio with walnut. We cannot turn back the hands of the clock, nor re- create the economic factors that have ben. exhausted to make the wealth and the social world to-day enjoyed by the ex- ploiters and l heir descendants. It is not so that evolution works. Th; ' rare civilization of the A/.tec> which Cortex crushed can never be restored. Only echoes from the tombs of the Lucumos, after the lapse of twenty centuries, attest the fact that once, in Etruria, there existed a civili/.alior distinctive, splendid, brilliant. Only the ashes in the urn of history remain of Ph. raoh’s Egypt, of Athens, Babylon, Persi. ... So, too, the golden opportunity of yester- day is gone, never to return within our bor- ders. The lesson of America, however, burned deep into the records of time. In Canada, such a man as Laurier roads itEverybody’s Magazine dearly. In the greater of the Latin re- publics in South America, they strive to prevent the very condition we find to-day in free America. In this matter of the real substance of rulership, the United States is to-day an example to the nations. WANTED—A LEADER! Vet, for all our lost opportunities, much remains that can be done and will be done. It is not my purpose here to sketch the proc- ess of salvation that is yet possible. Only, at this point in my writings, I would warn the people of my class, those of them who do not yet think about these things or under- stand them, that the moment has arrived when the people demand a Marius—a trib- une who shall lead them onward into free- dom, a man who shall stand before the world untrammeled by the golden chains of wealth, undefiled by the pollution of time-serving politics, filled with the inspiration of the people's will, courageous to battle to the very bitter end for the rights that the people demand. Only the morally and intellectually deaf cannot hear the sound of the call of the people. It sweeps from the plains of Kan- sas in the breath of the rustling corn; it swells from the hills of Montana in the thud of the drill and the rising and falling of picks in the mines; it whirs from the looms of the South and the North, where child-slavcs earn the bread of labor; it moans from the lofts of New York, in the voice of the slaves of the sweat-shop; it shrieks from the forges of Pittsburg, the charnels of Packingtown, the terrible mines of the mountains of coal. It is a call for a leader to Freedom—the freedom we bought with our blood and signed away in ignorance. I care not where you turn, the voices of the people crying for their rights rise stronger, fuller, more threat- ening year by year. Day by day they or- ganize. A meeting of farmers at St. Louis files a formal protest against the profits of the middleman, and forms a committee to investigate and report, and puts together a League of Reform. A machine-made politician in New York, in Massachusetts, in Pennsylvania, is crushed by the votes of The Concluding Instalment of “ The Passing of the people he fondly had dreamed he owned. A firmly entrenched public officer is branded a liar and a thief, no matter what committee may whitewash him. A great manufac- turing city of the Middle West chooses a Socialist mayor. A public document pub- lished to clear the skirls of a ruling party of ihe charge of being in part responsible for rising prices is laughed out of court by the people themselves. A daring and preposterous attempt on the part of organized railroad owners to advance rates to the general public while holding them down for the “ big interests” is met by a storm of organized protest. Chambers of commerce, industrial clubs, manufacturers’ guilds, consumers’ leagues spring up all over the country, expostulating, pleading, threat- ening, hurling legal thunderbolts. A Presi- dent yields to the clamor, and an attorney general launches the thunder of Washington against a move that, ten years ago, would have met only the scattered, sporadic, half- hearted, hopeless invective of the private citizen. The railroads yield, and begin the revision of rates ‘‘at the top,” by making agreements with the big organized shippers, the trusts. THE FIGHT BEGINS The time is ripe: the fight begins. The status quo is to be changed. In the political arena all is confusion. Already, from the lips of the old, trained leaders who, through long periods, have served the interests of the Plutocracy while wearing the livery of the People, come hesitating phrases of fear and confusion. One announces that he will re- tire after his present term. Another goes down to defeat, fighting to the last for his master. A third, branded a corruptionist, sees ruin stalkinjr him amid the shadows of the coming day. Another, reading the papers, dubs them traitors, and madly curses them before the eyes and in the ears of all the people. And presently some man, some strong man of the people, will hear the clear, un- mistakable call of Destiny to its chosen. Can he help but heed? History supplies the answer. Go read it, you who rest secure within your flimsy barriers of self-interest, self-confidence, and gold, the Idle Rich " will appear in the April Number.THE FAIR BY ZONA GALE Author ’• THE LOVES OF PP.I.I.F.AS AND JtTARKE." " FRIENDSHIP VILLA* ll.USTR \TIO\S IF Hetty had stood on the rim <>f thc world, looking it over and choosing her part, she would have wanted ex- actly the part which the morning held for her. Thc fluttering of the flag from the Fine Arts Building tower, and the moving, moving of thc crowd made a swift flowing of life within her as the bay mare trolted ■	'own the fairground at eleven r>'clr>rk in die morning on “County Day." “Oh, Egby,” Hetty said happily, “I Ket you they’ll all run us—don’t you?" "Leave ’em,” said Egby philosophically. Then he looked at her. there on the seat beside him—a look of magnificent posses- sion. thc look which can linger as it likes and need not turn away. "Golly-olly,” he said, “they don’t none of ’em need to remind me I’m married to you." Even yet, a whole month after the ev ent, the words had a kind of unreserve which 3 ;e love stokies, m. HY II J MOWAT made hearing them an adventure. Advcfi- tureit was. too, for Hetty to say “my hus- band." Never yet, before older women, had she called Egby that. Now she looked down at his brown hand on the lines and .il his sleeve, and suddenly she laughed up ..! him. “Egby," she said, "what’s by vo. ;• collar?" He brushed at his collar vaguely, not understanding. “You’ve forgot my first mending," she chided him. "I ain't." he defended, slipping his hand inside his coat collar, vvlure. on the shoul- der seam of the soft checked shirt, was the plain blue patch that Hetty had stitch-i' in there yesterday. "1 should say 1 ain’t The road curved. "Look at the Midway," Hetty cried ecstatically. “Mv, what a lot o' tenl at- •3Everybody’s Magazine tractions. Oh, Egby, won't we have fun there?” “Sure,” said Egby, “we'll be meetin’ everybody.” “’Specially Lulu Miner,” Hetty said. “Lulu Miner,” Egby repeated. “That’s so. Lulu Miner. Well, how do I know you ain’t here lookin’ for Lenny West?” “Oh, Egby,” said Hetty. “Gracious! I couldn’t bear him to speak to me, now.” “Well, scc’t you don’t,” said Egby masterfully. Her eye swept the scene, her young blood beating lime to the life of the place. “Ain’t it funny,” she said, “all the folks an’ the doin’s an’ the fun of fair-time an’ everything—an’ yet the biggest part is just bein’ us?” She always startled Egby somewhat when she thought things through. Boy- like, and some man-like, he, so to say, merely felt his reflections. Above all, he never said them. To tell his “notions” gave him the same undressed feeling which the naming of certain facts gave to Hetty. “What we goin’ to do first?” he de- manded, merely. “I know,” he went on. “ Look at the stuff an’ then go an’ set in the grand stand. An',” he added, “I ain’t got to wonder this year whether Lenny West is goin’ to set the other side of you.” “Lenny’s got a automobile this year,” remarked Hetty. “He’ll be here in that.” “That’s so, he has,” said Egby gloomily. “Well, now, if you’d ’a’ married him ” “Eg-by,” said Hetty. “Don’t—why, don’t!” “Well, 1 won’t— dum him,” Egby said. “Buy me some peanuts—buy me some peanuts before we go up in the grand Stand,” Hetty commanded; but instantly her face fell. “No—I guess not peanuts,” she added. “They’re kind o’ common, ain’t they?” “Common?” Egby repeated. “How’s that?” “Well, Lulu Miner use’ to say they’s common,” Hetty recalled. “ For cats’ sake,” said Egby, “ let’s leave up on Lulu Miner.” Driving down the grounds from the gate, they passed lumbcr-wagons, on whose seats or in chairs in the boxes were women and girls, dressed in their best—here a red waist, there an “all silk,” there a fabric negligible under the innocent ostentation of slarch and fresh ribbon. Last year it was so that Hetty had come, in her uncle’s wagon; and she had been longing for a white dress and new gloves. Of last year she remembered especially Lulu Miner’s white dress, white with blue ribbons, and her silver chatelaine and her big hat. Also Egby had taken Lulu for ice-cream—Hetty remembered Lulu’s way of lifting her face so that it seemed to be her mouth that she lifted. Lenny West had taken Hetty— she remembered her angry satisfaction that Lenny was so good-looking, but she was hearing every word that Egby said. And now—and now! Here she was, and Egby belonged to her, and they had come in a buggy, and she was dressed like this, and it was County Day, and everybody would be here to see. As Egby helped her to alight before the Fine Arts Building, Hetty heard the whis- per of two or three standing by the door— “The bride—there’s the bride.” And whereas on their brief wedding journey there had been for her in the suspicion a particular, delicious agony, tinged with de- light, now, back here in her home town and for the first time since their return, about to meet their old friends, the delight was chief, but touched, too, with a certain delicious and perfectly bearable agony. Yes, there was no mistaking, even to the eye of a stranger: Hetty was the bride eternal. Perhaps no one could have told quite how the fact was plain, but there is no way to tell of countless sweet certainties. Hetty was in white, new white, her ruftled skirt blossoming into pink at waist and throat: and her hat was white, new white, crisping into chiffon to veil rosebuds; and her long silk gloves were white, new white. But all these one left for the look of her eyes, which had that exquisite and peculiar liquidness of certain young life and young happiness, and the look of her cheeks, which were in a kind of rhythm of blushes, bloom- ing and going, but always coming back. And there was the witness of Egby, big and brown and conscious and in black, new black. One knew the bride-and-groom truth as simply as one recognizes roses. And for Hetty the self-consciousness of the moment was the heart of the delight. She swam into the hot Fine Arts Building as if she were entering upon some luring future. The long nave of the building was lined with exhibits: There were the stoves, hideous grotesques, like clowns put toThe Fair 375 uses; the sewing-machines, lined up in reticent domesticity; the rooms furnished “complete,” till one felt that one ought not to be looking; the school displays, shy with wistful promise or impudent with aspiration; the china painting, here a real dream caught on a cup, there a plaque of roses, magnified, made as definite as wounds under a microscope; the “oils," the “art squares”—vague reachings-out for beauty, reachings-out which ended in embroidering eggs and ice-cream. And to Hetty and Egby it was all as beautiful as it really was wonderful, and potent with life and with death; as wonderful as were the fine, sincere, feathery cakes, the flaky-crusted pies, so perfect that they might have been hung on the walls in the place of these walls’ more ambitious guests. “Would you look where the fruit ain't,” observed Egby. “Six plates of grapes for the whole lay-out—say, but this year's been fierce for the country. Not an apple— not an apple. Biggest apple here is a turnip. Say, ain't that a swell showin’? Blamed but I guess we’ll go west— we got to round up some climate somewhere*. Not a tomato—say, let's go an’ give a look at the stock. They don’t need no climate.” Hetty listened, not Io<iking in the stalls her eyes on the crowd. There was one and another and another whom she knew: the mayor ami his wife, both elderly and unim- pressed—oh, would ErIjv and she ever be iike that, not paying any attention to each other?—and there was Lillie Chalmers in a new cloth dress—she was pretty, but sht had lately been divorced, and some said it was because “she couldn’t cook a decent meal of victuals and she kept house so slipshod nobody could ’a’ stood it.” There she was, with “that Mis’ Raymer,” as stylish as she—“But awful loud-lookin’,” Hetty thought, and in an excess of young wifely dignity pretended not to see either of them. Behind them a piano broke out abruptly, as if it had kept still as long as it could, anil must instantly discharge all its incoherent, pent-up might. The crowd in the building took tip the melody and hummed it as they EETTY HEARD THE WHISPER Oi TWO OK THREE STANDING UY Tilt IXmR — " THE BRIDK—THERE’S THE BRIDE.”376 Everybody’s Magazine listened, and a chorus of fresh, girlish voices upbore it above the rest— Oh, the moon shines b-r-r-r-right and p-r-r-rctty, R-r-r-red Wing, La la la la la-a, la la la la la-a they exaggerated it, and ended in a cry: “Forevermore—here they are! Here's Hetty an’ Egby. We been lookin’ every- whercs for you— Hello, Bride. Well, forei'ermore! ” Even in that first moment of their wel- come, with Hetty one impression dominated: For here was Lulu Miner, but not the Lulu Miner of last year, whose costume Hetty herself had now half-unconsciously copied; but a Lulu Miner in a corn-colored coat and skirt with wide lace set in the seams, and a great hat of lace wreathed with huge gold beads; and with her was a stranger, “my friend, Miss Mears,” in a long gray cloth cape with white lining, who, to the “ Real pleased, I'm sure" of Hetty’s acknowledg- ment, returned an airy “Delightedindeed,” which to Hetty was somehow as discon- certing as a snub. But for the little bride there flooded underneath the moment the instant, warm, cherishing consciousness that Egby was hers, no matter what Lulu wore. But as she looked at Lulu, the better to revel in her own possession, Hetty saw something. Egby was married, but that made no difference in the way Lulu was looking at him. She stood before him with that old way of upturning her face so that it was her mouth that was upturned, and her eyes were on his, in his, in the same merry, challenging, even possessive way. Something caught at Hetty’s heart and would not let it beat. Lulu was looking at Egby as if she understood him, as if she were glad, after his absence, to sink back in his look. Moreover, it was so that Egby was looking at her —“but it's her fault, it’s her fault,” Hetty thought, “it’s her that's doing it. Of course he’s looking—but then he's just laughing and letting her look.” When, after the moment’s gay chatter, the badinage, the “runnin',” they all moved away together and stopped outside the building, “my friend, Miss Mears,” and the others walked beside Hetty, and Lulu fell in beside Egby. ‘ Let’s go back down the Midway,” said Lulu. " Everybody come on. I could die hearin’ the barkers. Couldn’t you?" They all followed—there was about Lulu a leadership that always left any rival baffled and defenseless. “My,” said Hetty, with a laugh to show how at ease she was, “I been wondering when we’d find you girls. We said. . . .” “Oh, gracious, we’ve been everywhere,” said Lulu—and there was about her that which, when she chose to speak, left the sentences of anybody else unfinished. Her sentences, her eyes, her presence were as insistent as her hat. “We been dying for a man to take us around. Seen Lenny? Say, his automobile is like parlor furni- ture-” All that she said was said to Egby. In the crowd the two were walking a little before Hetty and the others, Lulu always looking up. How nice they looked, walking together, Hetty thought uneasily. She herself was small of bone and girlishly slight. Lulu was large and strong and a blonde -she looked beautiful in her corn- color, beside Egby. And how glad they were to see each other—they seemed so used to each other. . . . The Midway, symbol of that slow transi- tion from the days when the County Fair was a thing of stock and produce and races to a time when it shall be indeed a festival of thc harvest, with drama and folk- dancing and historic pageantry—the Mid- way was trying its best to release its scheduled glamour: On the canvas facades, painted figures of dancing girls; every- where great colored letterings, music boxes, calls of the door-men with a penchant for Latin derivatives, all the contortion of gayety and lure. But, save to the very young, it was only as good-will conspired to mask sophistication that folk accepted it all. They liked the Midway not for it- self, but because it was nakedly there to be liked, and the time was one of pro- fessional merry-making. They did not enter into the moment; rather, they lent themselves to it—that dreary distinction between pleasure-seeking and ancient, sun- burnt mirth. Well down the tawdry avenue a tent with raised sides, and hung with pink mosquito netting, bore over its door the device: EATING PAVILION Il	was Lulu who said, “Oh, let’s get us some dinner now, while we can pick first.” And at the demurring of the others about leaving out Lenny West—“Who? Oh,THE WOMAN PUT EGBY'S CHANCE IK LULU MINER’S HAND. AND LVI.fJ DROPPED IT IN HIS PURSE A COIN AT A TIME, THE OTHERS LAUGHING AT THE WOMAN'S MISTAKE. Lenny’ll be fed. We don’t need to wait for Lenny now." They sat at one of the long tables, and were waited on by anxious, tired members of some Ladi.-s’ Missionary Society in the town. In the intervals when she turned her attention from the talk of I.ulu Miner, Hetty noted the evident head of the dining committee making solicitous excursionings to bring fresh, hot dishes to her own hus- band, who sat alone. Hetty watched the woman and smiled with the others. “Ain't wives the silliest, don’t you think?" said Miss Mears, and Hetty admitted it. But chiefly Hetty’s thought was on Lulu Miner, who, as a matter of course, had taken a place at Egby’s other side. "No sir,” Lulu was saying lightly, “no 'ood askin’ Egby to pay for our dinner. Egby’s got a family to support now.” “Come off,” said Egby; “this dinner is on us, all right. Ain’t it, Iletty?” Lulu pouted up at him, lifted her brows, -hook her head, ignored Hetty. “I expect you're that domestic, Egby," she said. In reality, Egby took a delicate, sheepish delight in this impeachment. He wanted to hear more. It was to him a kind of honest and loyal enjoyment to have Lulu 377 call him domestic, and to know that it wa« true. He prolonged the moment. “Oh, I donno,” he said. “Ain't you?” said Lulu airily. “I ex- pect I'll see you helpin' dishes often. Ij I’m asked over.” “Hetty an' I are goin’ to hev the crowd over all the time when we get house- keeping” said Egby magnificently. “Ain’t we, Hetty?” "Sure,” said Hetty bravely. But sud- denly she could see Lulu Miner at their house, their house, looking at Egby across their supper-table, laughing, flirting, under- standing him. . . . anil she herself obliged to pretend to notice nothing. As she was having to pretend now. Presently, “Isn't it?" said Egby earn- estly, to something which Hetty liad not heard Lulu say. What had she said, Hetty wondered, and wasn’t what what? . . . “Do you still not take any coffce, Egby?” I.ulu saifl, once. “I think they said they’d got some cocoa I'll ask.” She did ask, and the cocoa came. Hetty watched to see if Egby would drink it. It was their first dinner together at a fair, and it was I.ulu who was looking out for him! Hetty looked across at the head of the dining- room committee, who was just bringing her37 s Everybody’s Magazine husband a heaped-up plate of steaming apple-pudding. And Hetty had for the woman a sudden fellow-feeling. It was nice for her to be looking after her husband like that. •’Where's your paper napkin, Egby?” Hetty asked desperately, in a need somehow to show that he was hers to take care of. "Oh. kickin’ under my feet somewheres,” Egby said easily. “Napkins for fair-time is too stylish for me." “Me either." said Lulu Miner. Hetty looked miserably down at Egby’s sleeve. The sleeve and his brown hand seemed like somebody else’s. And then abruptly something sent through her a sudden little glow and thrill. Oh, Lulu Miner could look tip at Egby if she liked; but on Egby’s right shoulder, in front, near the collar, was the plain blue patch that Hetty had stitched in there yesterday and that Lulu didn’t know anything about. In that crowd of their old friends, with Lulu Miner’s challenging and Miss Mears’s posing, somehow that little wifely service which her hands had done for Egby became a symbol of their bond, and Lulu's artful- ness seemed petty and impotent. Why, he was hers—Hetty’s. It was her place to do things for him always. She could afford to let Lulu have him a minute or two. “117// you look at that woman?" mur- mured Miss Mears. as the head of the com- mittee followed apple-pudding with ice- cream for her husband’s nourishment. “Well. I think it’s real sweet for her to be doin' like that!’’ Hetty flung back unex- pectedly. But when the Eating Pavilion Treasurer took from Egby the money for the din- ner. the others protesting, and pretending exertions to pay. the woman [ml Egby’s change in Lulu Miner’s hand. And Lulu dropped it in his purse a coin at a time, the others laughing at the woman’s mistake. “No wonder she believed Lulu was his wife." thought little Hetty wretchedly, and all the unhappiness of the hour was back upon her. As they stepped out on the Midway again, Lulu took her place at Egby's side with: "I bet. Egby, when you get to housekeeping you’ll forget all about us. I bet none of us will ever see you. then." "Aw. come." said Egby, nettled. ’’ We’re only married. We ain't dead.” Hetty fell back a step or two behind the others. “Only marriedSo that was the way he thought of it. So Lulu didn't feel that Egby’s being married made a difference, and Egby didn’t feel it either. Was that the way it was in the world, with men and women? On this her misery of the last hour found climax. Hetty looked up and down the Midway. If only she could get away from the others before she stopped being able to pretend. Lulu and the rest were now frankly looking for Lenny West. The people were pouring into the Eating Pavil- ion. The avenue was nearly blocked. Obeying an impulse which she hardly felt. Hetty stepped farther back, let the crowd flow in and close in between her and the others, stepped sidewise behind the first ticket-box of an “attraction” tent, and reached up blindly for a ticket. In that tent, if she could get in there, the others wouldn’t find her. She couldn’t bear it, just then, any more. When the tired, elderly man on the box had given her a ticket and she had got within the tent-wings. she was confronted by a tiny boy in khaki rompers, who threw hi* arms above his head with— “I'm de ticket-taker!” The man looked over his shoulder and smiled. "All right.” he said to Hetty, his eyes still on the child. No one was in the tent, which proved to hold the largest horse in the world, “Nan- nie, the queen of the feminine sect." A woman, short-skirted, sallow, with that air of the casual common to all whose business is eternal repetition, launched on her sing- song description of the big horse. “She is eleven feet, six inches long - the tent is twenty-two feet—measure he with your own eyes. She weighs 3,030 pounds. She is twenty-four hands high - She is six years old. broke to tandem, double, and saddle. She was foalded in Lloyd County,” she went on and on. her eyes taking frank, up-and-down account of Hetty’s dress. Hetty, staring at the hors.. hardly heard what the woman said. . . . Hetty was trying to understand. While Egby and she had been engaged, there had been little things that hurt, of course, of which she never spoke—like Egby’s darn- ing with Lulu Miner more than twice in an evening, and his sitting beside that girl from the city on the way to the picnic, andThe Fair 379 so on. But it had not occurred to Hetty that when they were married these things would not end, magically. Why, they two would be married! Was being married like this lor everybody in the world? Suddenly the ticket-box man put his head around the canvas. “ Darn you." lie- said frankly to the woman, “keep the kid in there with you, can't you? He’s under the whole Midway’s feet.” “Come ’ere, Titus,” said the woman, casually. And then she called to the man: “Lou, ain’t it time for your medicine?” “Gosh, yes,” the man answered. “I’d forgot it again.” Hetty looked at the woman. That must have hurt. Hetty thought vaguely—to have had him speak to her—that way. And yet, in spile of the ugliness of the inci- dent, something lay warm in the thought of it, and it was that undisturbed question of the wife about the medicine. Egby had never spoken “hard” before folks. Well, and of course she just couldn’t hear it if he ever did—before folks. But her thought lingered on the wife’s question about the medicine, and a light wave of understand- ing swept her. ■'That wasreai kind ■»’ nice." she thought, and somehow remembered the patch on Egby’s shoulder. 1‘hen with that the hurt surged back again. “Lulu Miner got right into his eyes with that look of hers," she remembered, too, “and Egby let her in." Oh, she could have stood anything else! But when they were married, how could any one act to either of them as if they were not married? ‘‘Why," said some one softly, “why, Hetty. Little Hetty.” Beside her, bend- ing over her. holding out his hand, was Lenny West. “ Hello, Lenny," she said mechanically. “Gloriation," Lenny said, “but it seems good and grand to see you back! What you doin’ in here? I saw you from thc machine—goin’ into some tent alone. I couldn’t tell which one—I’ve paid my way into this-is-the-third, my George, to catch you. “Where’s- ?" he hesitated. “Come out o’ this!" he bade her. “Come on back where the machine is.” In an instant Hetty’s spirits rose. Very well, here was Lenny, glad to see her— and Egby probably hadn’t missed her yet. “cu>w vriox," IENNY suit, "but IT SEEMS GOOD am. OH AND T> ill.

They were making their way against the 'treum going toward the Eating Pavilion, md their progress was slow. Lenny, guid- ing her to the trodden turf beside the road, made no attempt : hasten that progress, it was noon now, and the grounds were tilled. The last forenoon busses" had rattled in and discharged their loads. In 'hi- air hung, like autumn haze, the dust of :he long drought, and the hot hush of September noon lay strangely above the \>abel. The Pavilion, the booths where lunches were served, the grand stand, where lunches were eaten, became focal; but the beat of the band, the drone of the iierry-go-round. the cries of the showmen persisted.

"Sure we will,” Hetty said, and stumbled on a hummock and drew away from him and his gentle, awkward "Oop” of rescue-. “We’re goin’ to have the crowd over all the time when we get housekeeping” she re- peated Egby'* words to Lulu. "I didn't say crowd. I said ‘me,' ” Lenny suggested. "Sure we'll let you," Hetty repeated lightly. " We’ll want you.” Lenny looked out over the sunny field. His face was of the type that in repose takes on pensiveness, idealizing the simple good looks, definitely belying the good- natured commonplace which lies behind. “Darn everything.” he observed. With a kind of girlish bravado of revenge .n Egby and Lulu, Hetty caught him up. "Don't you want to come to our house?” Lenny turned to her, stooping ever so slightly and briefly to win her look. “You know I do,” he said. Hetty's face crimsoned, her eyes flew afield. There was no mistaking. This was Lenny's old "half makin' fun." half tender look of last year at the fair, of all the time before she had been married. How could he do that now—how could he. . . . She kept silently beside him, trying to understand. What would other women do? Would they answer him, give him back his look—let Lenny in their eyes as— «»h, as Egby had let in Lulu Miner? H'u.v this the way it was with men and women in the world? "There ain't nobody like you, Hetty, Lenny said soberly. "I tell you what, when you go away it just about empties •tit the town for me.” Still she said nothing. But suddenly she felt a kind of homesickness, as definite as when in her little girlhood she had been wont to want her mother; and there came a great sense of unprotection, as if some barrier were gone, and a lonesomeness, as if things that belonged to her had been taken away. Why, she was married— they were married. . . . How could things be like this? "There,” said Lenny, “the machine- over there You stay right here an' I’ll bring it round. Oh, Hetty, this is like cornin' to life again!” Still she said nothing, nor did she look up as he went.

The crowd was moving . . . moving. . . . Watching it, a sudden sick distaste swept her. What were they all like, anyway? Had she ever known people as people/ They had always been going by and going by around her, but had she ever really known much about them? Oh, and were they like this? Looking for Egby, she was conscious of those who passed her on the Midway: the monkcy-traincr, in short red skirt and huge, white satin slippers and a flopping cloak; three of the women from the Eating Pavilion, recruiting ice-cream from a stall; a family of five, sharing one p»tp corn bug; two middle-aged men in the special black of best clothes, meeting with a shout, block- ing the Midway with their handshake; boys, distributing orange handbills; a woman stopping to tie her husband's neck- tie and he jerking impatiently free of her hands; an old man in a linen coat and gog- gles, with a little pail of something which he was taking home; a carpenter from the village carrying his little lx>y. his brown hand outspread on the child’s plaid skirt; grocerymen and merchants from the vil- lage, where the stores were closed on “County Day”; Grandma Birch, wearing her huge button picture of Grandpa Birch, who had not spoken to her for five years before he died. (Hetty knew how, on his deathbed, he had in his delirium called her old secret names, but he had died with- out speaking sanely to her). . . . “Look at this great, big, large, enormous fish an t alive”—was bawled above the noise. There went the mayor and his wife, elderly, unim- pressed: How fine for them to have had all those years together, went unexpectedly through Hetty’s head. Near Hetty, within the shelter of the Rest Tent, a woman was quieting a child, and her husband, warm and panting, ha-1 just joined them. “Tired settin’?’’ he asked. “No, I ain't,” the woman said shortly. “I’m sick of everjthing but settin’. Ben- nie's coinin’ down with somethin’ awful 1 never see him so ugly.” “Give ’m to me,” her husband invited. "I won’t do any such a thing. You always jounce him out of his senses,” said the wife. “Well, come on somewhere?. We’ll leave Bennie home with in a to-morrow,’’ he suggested. “I'm glad you had sense enough to think of that." his wife said, and rose to follow him. “Your hat’s on a little mite crooked,” Hetty heard him say as they passed her. “It ain't either," said thewoman—and then they both laughed, as if at some old household joke of her impatience in like case. Tom-toms sounded from the Winnebago Indian pen; a little Angora goat, escaped, ran bleating down an aisle swiftly formed i-ir him; the odor of hot meal pancakesEverybody’s Magazine came from the ring-and-cane booth where pancakes were prizes; snatches of talk reached Heltv from two women, sitting in the Rest Tent behind her. “Mv feet hurt so I declare I bet they kwnc they hurt,” said one, “an’ yet the minute I get home Jerry'll expect a warm meal.” “Oh, Dode, too,” said the other. “Men is men. Mis' Bird. 1 expect Dode’ll want to kill a chicken. That's what he always thinks of when I'm nearest to dead. . . .” “Jerry manages different," said Mis’ Bird. “Just as we’re startin' off some- whcres he’s got somethin’ to bo mended— hole in his pocket, like enough. ...” “-great, big. enormous fish and alive,” the strident voice went on. . . . “Nannie! Nannie! Queen of the feminine seel!” came faint and far. Suddenly and at first inexplicably a little warm spot glowed in Hetty’s con- sciousness. like a place to sink her thought. ' Somethin' to be mended—” That was making a little spot of remembrance warm. A swift, indeterminate surge of fellowship fur the two women swept her; and for that other woman, gone off with Bennie; and for the keeper of Nannie and the husband who forgot his medicine. ... As abruptly as if a glory from widely-opened doors smote across the fairground, Hetty looked in on the life of the crowd: Families; hus- bands “wantin’ warm meals"; wives with tired feet and crooked hats; men saying “darn you" and wives telling on about big horses, jealously serving their husbands’ dinners, wearing their button pictures, laugh- ing. companioning, finding "somethin’ to be mended”—why. they were all in this together and they all knew what one an- other knew, and all the Lulu Miners and the Lenny Wests and their eyes and their voices were as far outside really, as was last year’s fair. And it was true for them all, true for everybody who would have it so, who hung on and hung on to these things, no matter what. . . . She turned and looked at the two women in the tent. “Here's an extra box to set on," one of them said to her. hospitably. “No, thank you." Hetty said. “I—my husband'll be lookin’ for me.” Dode’s wife nodded. “So’ll mine,” she said, "an’ he don’t like to be kep’ waitin' much, either.” Hetty smoothed at her pink belt and looked at the women shyly. “Us wives have to toe the mark, don’t we?” she said—and looked like a rose. When she turned, Egby spied her, ran to her. He was alone, and his eyes had been everywhere, seeking her. “Why, Hetty—dear,” he cried, “how did you get lost? I been lookin’ myself crazy.” She put her hand through his arm. Lillie Chalmers and “that Mis’ Raymer” passing at the moment, Hetty waited in an excess of sudden compassion that they had some- how not “hung on," and she bowed to them in a kind of wistful graciousness. “Egby,” she said, “I'll tell you after- ward. An’ I saw Lenny West.” "Him?” Egby said, stopping short. “Ugh, yes, Egby—him, an’ listen to me listen. After bein' here an' secin everybody—are you just as glad as you can be you married me? No—you needn’t to tell me that!” she cried. “I want to tell you. I'm glad. I’m so glad I'm married to you that 1 want to yell it out loud. Egby—it's a great thing—isn’t it—isn't it? Egby! Will you do somethin’?” He looked down at her. He was be- wildered by her tenderness that somehow beat upon him. For a moment t hey stood still in the dusty open, about them the people moving . . . moving on the fair- ground and the wide beyond and away to the rim of the world. “Egby," Hetty said, “you turn back your coat a minute so’s I can sec that patch I put on your shoulder. That way—so. Now there they come, all of ’em, in Lenny's automobile. Don’t let’s go in that. You get me some peanuts—and come on up in the grand stand quick!'’UNDER THE ®UJ3 PROPHET IN UTAH ■ ■ ■ The National Menace of A Political Priestcraft ■ 'Ey Frank J.

The news of President Wood- ruff’s “revelation" had percolated through the whole community. The Gentiles were alarmed for themselves. My friends were anxious for me. All the old enmities that had so long divided Utah were arranging themselves for a new conflict. And Rich and Devine had come to urge me to remem- ber a promise given to my supporters that I would hold lo my candidacy no matter who should appear in the lield against me. Of my father’s stand in the crisis Rich could give me only one indication: after a conference in the offices of the Presidency, Rich had said to President Woodruff: “Then I supjiose I may as well close lip Frank’s rooms at the Templeton"—the hotel in which my friends had opened polit- ical headquarters for me—and my father accompanying him to an anteroom, had hinted significantly: “I think you shoulil not close Frank’s rooms just yet. He ma> need them.” Rich brought me word, too, that tlu Church authorities were expecting lo se* me; and as soon as I arrived in Salt I.ak< City, I hastened to the little plastered house in which the Presidency had its offices. President Woodruff, my father, and Joseph F. Smith were there, in the large room of their official apartments. We withdrew, for private conference, into the small retiring room in which I had con suited with “Brother Joseph Mack" when he was on the underground—in 1888—and had consulted with President Woodrufl about his “manifesto," in 1S90. President Woodruff sat at the head of a ;>S3>84 Everybody’s Magazine bare walnut table in a chair so large that it rather dwarfed him; and he sank down in it. to an attitude of nervous reluctance to speak, occupied with his hands. Smith took his place at the opposite end of the board, with dropped eyes, his chair tilted back, silent, but (as I soon saw) unusually alert and attentive. My father assumed his inevitable composure—firmly and al- most unmovingly sealed—and looked at me squarely with a not unkind premonition of a smile. President Woodruff continued silent. Ordinarily, anything that came from the Lord was quite convincing to him and needed no argument (in his mind) to make it convincing to others. I could not sup- pose that the look of determination on my face troubled him. It was more likely that something unusual in the mental attitudes of his councillors was the cause of his hesi- tation; and with this suspicion to arouse me I became increasingly aware of two rival watchfulnesses upon me. “Well?" I said. "What was it you wanted of me?" Smith looked up at the President. And Smith had always, hitherto, seemed so unseeing of consequences, and therefore unappreciative of means, that his betrayal of interest was indicative of purpose. I thought 1 could detect, in thc communica- tion which his manner made, the plan of my father’s ecclesiastical rivals to remove him from the scene of his supreme influence over the President, and the plan of ambi- tious Church politicians to remove me from their path by the invocation of God’s word appointing father to the Senate. “Frank,” the President announced, "it is the will of the Lord that your father should go to the Senate from Utah.” As he hesitated, 1 said: "Well, Presi- dent Woodruff?” He added, with less decision: " And we want you to tell us how to bring it about.” It was evident that getting the revela- tion was easy to his spiritualized mind, but that fulfilling it was difficult to his uuworldlincss. “President Woodruff," I replied, "you have received the revelation on the wrong point. You do not need a voice from heaven to convince any one that my father is worthy to go to the Senate, but you will need a revelation to tell how he is to get there." He seemed to raise himself to the in- spiration of divine authority. "Thc only difficulty that we have encountered,” he said, “is the fact that the legislators arc pledged to you. Will you not release them from their promises and tell them to vote for your father?” “No,” I said. “And my father would not permit me to do it. even if I could. He knows that I gave my word of honor to my supporters to stand as a candidate, no matter who might enter against me. He knows that he and I have given our pledges at Washington that political dictation in Utah by the heads of the Mormon Church shall cease. Of all men in Utah we cannot be amenable to such dictation. If you can get my supporters away from me—very well. I shall have no personal regrets. But you cannot get me away from my supporters.” This inclusion of my father in my refusal evidently disconcerted President Woodruff; and, as evidently, it had its significance to Joseph F. Smith. 1 went on: "Before I was elected to the House of Representatives, 1 asked my father if he intended to be a candidate for the Senate. I knew that some prominent Gentiles, desiring to curry favor at Church headquarters, had solicited his candidacy. 1 had been told that General Clarkson and others had assured him by' letter that his election would be accepted at Washington, and elsewhere. I discussed the matter with him fully. He agreed with me that his election would l>e a violation of the under- standing with the country; and he declared that he did not care to become again the storm-center of strife to his people, nor did he feel that he could honorably break our covenant to the country. With this clear understanding liotween us, I made my pledges to men who, in supporting me. cast aside equally advantageous relations which they might have established with another. 1 can’t withdraw now without dishonor." My father said: “Don’t let us have any misunderstanding. As President Wood- ruff stated the matter to me, I understood that it would be pleasing to the Lord v the people desired my election to thc Senate and it wouldn’t antagonize thc country." “Yes, yes,” the President put in. “That's what I mean.” Smith said, rather sourly: “The people are always willing to do what the Lord de- sires—if no one gives them bad counsel.”Under the Prophet in L*i::h Both he and my father emphasized the fact that the business interests of the East were making strung representations to the Presidency in support of my father's elec- tion; and I suspected (what 1 afterward found to be the case) that both Joseph 1'. was a deplorable evidence, to me, oi the willingness of some of our former allies to drag us swiftly t<> the shame of a broken covenant, if only they could prolit in purse or politics by our dishonor. I would not be an agent in any such betrayal, but I had "I CAN'T WITHDRAW NOW WITIIt'l'T DISHONOR." Smith and Apostle John Henry Smith were, by this time, in close communication with Republican politicians. There was a calm assumption, everywhere, that the Church had jKjvver to decide the election, if it could be induced to act; and this assumption to refuse without offending my father's trust in the divine inspiration of President Woodruff's decision and without aiding the Smiths in their conspiracy. Either at this conference or at one of the later ones, two or three apostles lain--Everybody’s Magazine into the room; and among them was Apos- tle Brigham Young, son of the Prophet Brigham who had led the Mormons to the Salt Lake Valley. When he understood my refusal to abandon my candidacy, he said angrily: ‘“This is a serious filial disresj>ect. I know my father never would have brooked bitch treatment from me.” And I retorted: "1 don’t know who invited you into this conference, but I deny your right to in- struct me in my filial duty. It my father doesn’t understand that the senatorsliip has lost its value for me—that it’s a cross now—then my whole lifetime of devotion to him has been in vain.” My father rose and put his arm around my shoulders. "This boy," he said, "is acting honorably. I want him to know— and you to know- that 1 respect the posi- tion he has taken. If he is elected, he shall have my blessing.” That was the only understanding 1 had with him—hut it was enough. I could know that 1 was not to lose his trust and affection by holding to our obligations of honor; and—an assurance almost as pre- cious—I could know that he would not consciously permit legislators to be crushed by the vengeance of the Church if they refused to yield to its pressure. A few days after my arrival in Utah,and while this controversy was at its height, my father’s birthday was celebrated (Jan- uary ii, i.Sq6), with all the patriarchal pomp of a -Mormon family gathering, in his big country house outside Salt Lake City. All his descendants and collateral relatives were there, as well as the members of the Presidency and many friends. After dinner, the usual exercises of the occasion were held in the large reception hall of the house, with President Woodruff and my father and two or three other Church lead- ers seated in semi-state at one end of the hall, and the others of the company defer- entially withdrawn to face them. Toward the end of the program President Wood- ruff rose from his easy-chair, and made a sort of informal address of congratulation; and in the course of it, with his hand on my father’s shoulder, he said benignly: "Abraham was the friend of God. He had only one son, on whom all his hopes were set. But the voice of the Lord com- manded him to sacrifice Isaac upon an altar: and Abraham trusted the Lord and laid his son upon the altar, in obedience to God's commands. Xow here is another servant of the Most High and a friend of God. I refer to President Cannon, whose birthday we are celebrating. He has twenty-one sons; and if it shall be the will of the Lord that he must sacrifice one of them, he ought to be as willing as Abraham was, for he will have twenty left. And the son should be as willing as Isaac. We can all safely trust in the Lord. He will require no sacrifice at our hands without purpose." I remarked to a relative beside me that the altar was evidently ready for me, but that 1 feared I should have to "get out and rustle my own ram in the thicket.” I re- ceived no reply. I heard no word of com- ment from any one upon the President’s speech. It was accepted devoutly, with no feeling that he had abused the privileges of a guest. Every one understood (as 1 did) that President Woodruff was the gentlest of men; that he had often pro- fessed and always shown a kindly affection for me; but that, the will of the Lord being now known, he thought I should be proud to be sacrificed to it! Among the legislators pledged to me were Mormon bishops and other ecclesi- asts who had promised their constituents to vote for me and who now stood between a betrayal of their people and a rebellion against the power of the hierarchy. I re- leased one of them from his pledge because of his pathetic fear that he would be eter- nally damned if he did not obey “the will of the Lord.” The others went to the Presidency to admit that if they betrayed their people they would have to confess what pressure had been put upon them to force them to the betrayal. I went to notify my father (as I had notified the representatives of every other candidate), that we were going to call a caucus of the Republican majority of the legislature, and later 1 was advised that President Woodruff and his councillors had appointed a committee to investigate and report to them how many members could be counted upon to support my father's candidacy. The committee (composed of my uncle Angus, my brother Abraham, and Apostle John Henry Smith) brought back word that, even among the men who had pro- fessed a willingness to vote for my father, there was great reluctance and apprehen- sion, and that in all probability his elec- tion could not be carried. With PresidentWoodruff's consent, my father then an- nounced that he was not a candidate. I was nominated by acclamation. When 1 called upon my father at the President's offices after the election, he said to me before his colleagues: “I wish to congratulate you on having acted honor- ably and fearlessly. You have my bless- ing." He turned to the President. "You see. President Woodruff," he added, "it was not the will of the Lord, after all. since the people did not desire my election!” I have dwelt so largely upon the religious aspects of this affair because they are as true of the Prophet in |M»litics to-day as they were then. At the time, the personal complication of the situation most dis- tressed me—the fact that I was opposing my father in order to fulfill the word of honor that we had given on behalf of the Mormon leaders. Hut there was another view of the matter; and it is the one that is most important to the purposes of tliis narrative. In the cour.se of the various discussions and conferences upon the senatorship, I learned that the inspiration oi the whole attempted betrayal had come from certain Republican politicians and lobbyists (like Colonel Isaac Trumbo' who claimed to represent a political combination of busi- ness interests in Washington. Joseph F. Smith admitted as nun h l<* me in more than one conversation. <1 had offended thesj interests by opposing a monetary and a tariff bill during my service as delegate i.» Congress—a matter which I have still to recount.) They had chosen my father and Colonel Trumbo as Utah's two senators. I made it my particular business to see that Trumbo’s name was not even men- tioned in the caucus. The man selected as the other senator was Arthur Brown, prominent Gentile lawyer who was known as a "jack-Mormon" (meaning a Gentile adherent to Church power), although I then believed, and do now, that Judge Charles C. Goodwin was the Gentile most entitled to the place. I was, however, content with the victory we had won by resisting the influence of the business interests that had been willing to sell our honor for their profit, and I set out for Washington with a determination to con- tinue the resistance. I was in a good posi- tion to continue it. The election of two Republican senators from Utah had given the Republicans a scant majority of the members of the Upper House, and the bills that I had fought in the Lower House were now before the Senate. In the previous December (1S05) these bills had been introduced in the House of * lllu«II "ibiw" II* »liurt trillEverybody's Magazine Representatives immediately upon its con- vening. l»y the committee on rules, be- fore Speaker Reed had even appointed the general committees. One was a bill to authorize the issuance of inte.'est-bear- ing securities of the United States at such times and in such sums as the Executive might determine. The other was a general tariff bill that proposed increases upon the then existing Wilson- Gorman hill. The first would put into the hands of the President a power that was not enjoyed by any ruler in Chris- tendom; the second would add to the un- fair and discriminatory tariff rates then in force, by making ad valorem increases in them. Many new members of Congress had been elected on the two issues thus created: the arbitrary increase of the bonded indebt- edness by President Cleveland to maintain a gold reserve; and the unjust benefits afforded those industries that were least in need of aid, by duties increased in exact proportion to the strength of the industrial combination that was to be protected. The presentation of the two bills by the Committee on Rules—with a “coachcr” to each proposing to prevent amendment and limit discussion had raised a revolt in the House. A caucus of the insurgent Republican members was held at the Ebbitt Hotel, and 1 was elected temporary chair- man. We appointed a committee to de- mand from Speaker Reed a division of the questions and time for opposition to be heard. We had seventy-five insurgents when our committee waited on Reed; and most of us were new men, elected to oppose such measures as these bills ad- vocated. He received us with sarcasm, put us off with a promise to consider our de- mands, and then set his lieutenants at work among us. Under the threat of the Speaker’s displeasure if we continued to “insurge” and the promise of his favor if we “got into line,” forty-one (I think) of our seventy-five deserted us. We were gloriously beaten in the House on both measures. Some of the older Republican members of the House came to ask me how 1 had been “misled”; and they received with the raised eyebrow and the silent shrug my explanation that 1 had been merely following my convictions and living up to the promises I had made my constituents. 1 had supposed that I was upholding an orthodox Republican doctrine in helping to defend the country from exploitation by the financial interests, in the matter of the bond issue, and from the greed of the business interests, in the attempt to in- crease horizontally the tariff rates. I do not need, in this day of tariff reform agitation, to argue the injustice of the latter measure. But the bond issue— looking back upon it now—seems the more cruelly absurd of the two. Here we were, in times of peace, with ample funds in the national treasury, proposing to permit the unlimited issuance of interest-bearing gov- ernment bonds in order to procure gold, for the national treasury, out of the hoards of the banks, so that these same banks might be able to obtain the gold again from the treasury in return for paper money. The extent to which this sort of absurdity might be carried would depend solely upon the desire of the confederation of finance to have interest-bearing govern- ment bonds on which they might issue na- tional bank notes, since the Executive was apparently willing to yield interminably to their greed, in the belief that he was protecting the public credit by encouraging the financiers to attack that credit with their raids on the government gold reserve. The whole difficulty had arisen, of course, out of the agitation upon the money ques- tion. The banks were drawing upon the government gold reserve; and the govern- ment was issuing bonds to recover the gold again from the banks. I had been, for some years, interested in the problem of our monetary system and had studied and discussed it among our Eastern bankers and abroad. The very fact that I was from a “silver state” had put me on my guard, lest a local influence should lead me into economic error. I had grown into the belief that our system was wrong. It seemed to me that some remedy was imperative. 1 saw in bimetallism a part of the remedy, and I supported bimet- allism not as a partisan of free coinage but as an advocate of monetary reform. The arrival of Utah’s two representa- tives in the Senate (January 27,1S96) gave the bimetallists a majority, and when the bond-issue bill came before us we made it into a bill to permit the free coinage of silver (February 1). A few days later, the Finance Committee turned the tariff bill into a free-coinage bill also. On both measures, five Republican senators votedagainst tluir party -Henry M. Idler of Colorado, Fred T. Dubois of Idaho, Thomas H. Carter of Montana, Lee Man- tle of Montana, and myself. We were subsequently joined by Richard F. Petti- grew. of South Dakota. Within two weeks of ray taking the oath in the Senate, we were read out of the party by Republican leaders and Republican organs. All this happened so swiftly that there was no time for any remonstrances to come to me from Salt Lake City, even if the Church authorities had wished to remon- strate. The fact was that the people of Utah were with us in our insurgency, and when the financial interests subsequently appealed to the hierarchy, they found the Church powerless to aid them in support of a gold platform. Hut they obtained that aid, at last, in support of a tariff that was as unjust to the people as it was favor- able t• ■ the trusts, and my continued '‘in- surgency" led me again into a revolt against Church interference. The thread of connection that ran through these incidents is clear enough to me now: they were all incidents in the progress of a partnership lietween the Church and the predatory business inter- ests that have since so successfully ex- ploited the country. Hut. at the time, I saw no such connection clearly. I 'tip- posed that the partnership was merely a political friendship between the Smith faction in the Church and the Republican politicians who wished to use the Church; and I had sufficient contempt for the political abilities of the Smiths to regard their conspiracy rather lightly. Believing still in the good faith of the Mormon people and their real leaders in authority. 1 introduced a joint resolution in the Senate restoring to the Church its escheated real estate, which was Still in the hands of a receiver, although its per- sonal property had been already restored. In conference with Senators Hoar and Allison—of the committee to which the resolution was referred— I urged an uncon- ditional restoration of the property, arguing that to place conditions upon the restora- tion would be to insult the jieople who had given so many proofs of their willingness to obey the law and keep their pledges. The property was restored without condi- tions by a joint resolution that passed the Senate on March iS. i8q6. passed the II«>use a week later, and was approved by the President on March :0. The Church was now free of the last measure of pro- scription. Its people were in the enjoy- ment of every political liberty of American citizenship; and I joined in the presiden- tial campaign of 1S06 with no thought ofEverybody’s Magazine any danger threatening us that was not common to the other communities of the country. But before I continue farther with these political events, 1 must relate a private incident in the secret betrayal of Utah— an incident that must be related, if this narrative is to remain true to the ideals of public duty that have thus far assumed to inspire it an incident of which a false ac- count was given before a Senate Committee in Washington during the Smoot investiga- tion of 1904, accompanied by a denial of responsibility by Joseph I'. Smith, the man whose authority alone encouraged and ac- complished the tragedy—for it was a tragedy, as dark in its import to the Mor- mon community as it was terrible in its im- mediate consequences to all our family. By his denial of responsibility and by secret whisper within the Church, Smith has placed the disgrace of the betrayal upon my father, who was guiltless of it, and blackened the memory of my dead brother by a misrepresentation of his mo- tives. I feel that it is incumbent upon me, therefore, at whatever pain to myself, to relate the whole unhappy truth of the affair, as much to defend the memory of the dead as to denounce the betrayal of the living, to exjKjse a public treason against the community not less than to correct a private wrong done to the good name of those whom it is my right to defend. Late in July, 1896, when I was in New York on business for the Presidency, I received a telegram announcing the death of my brother, Apostle Abraham H. Can- non. We had been companions all our lives; he had been the nearest to me of our family, the dearest of my friends—but even in the first shock of my grief I realized that my father would have a greater stroke of sorrow to bear than I; and in hurrying back to Salt Lake City I nerved myself with the hope that I might console him. I found him and Joseph F. Smith in the office of the Presidency, sitting at their desks. My father turned as I entered, and his face was unusually pale in spite of its composure; but the moment he recognized me, his expression changed to a look of pain that alarmed me. lie rose and put his hand on my shoulder with a tenderness that it was his habit to conceal. "I know how you feel his loss,” he said hoarsely, “but when I think what he would have had to pass through if he had lived—I cannot regret his death.” The almost agonized expression of his face, as much as the terrible implication of his words, startled me with I cannot say what horrible fear about my brother. I asked— “Why! Why—what has happened?” With a sweep of his hand toward Smith at his desk—a gesture and a look the most unkind I ever saw him use—he answered: “A few weeks ago, Abraham took a plural wife, Lillian Hamlin. It became known. He would have had to face a prosecution in court. His death has saved us from a calamity that would have been dreadful tor the Church—and for thc state.” ‘•Father!” I cried. “Has this thing come back again! And the ink hardly dry on the bill that restored your church prop- erty on the pledge of honor that there would never be another ease—” I had caught the look on Smith’s face, and it was a look of sullen defiance. "How did it happen?” My father replied: ‘‘I know—it’s awful. I would have prevented it if I could. I was asked for my consent, and I refused it. President Smith obtained the acquiescence of President Woodruff, on the plea that it wasn’t an ordinary case of polygamy but merely a fulfillment of the Biblical in- struction that a man should take his dead brother’s wife. Lillian was betrothed to David, and had been sealed to him in eternity after his death. 1 understand that President Woodruff told Abraham he would leave the matter with them if they wished to take the responsibility—and President Smith performed the ceremony.” Smith could hear every- word that was said. My father had included him in the conversation, and he was listening. He not only did not deny his guilt; he ac- cepted it in silence, with an expression of sulky disrespect. He did not deny it later, when the whole community had learned of it. He went with Apostle John Henry Smith to see Mr. P. H. Lannan, proprietor of the Salt Lake Tribune, to ask him not to attack the Church for this new and shocking violation of it> covenant. Mr. Lannan had been intimately friendly with my brother, and he was distressed between his regard for his dead friend and his obligation to do his public duty. I do not know all that the Smiths said to him; but I know that the conversation assumed that Joseph F. Smithhad performed the marriage ceremony; 1 know that neither of the Smiths made any attempt to deny the assumption; and 1 know that Joseph F. Smith sought to placate .Mr. Lannan by promising "it shall not occur again.” And this interview was sought by the Smiths, palpably because, wherever the marriage of Abraham H. Cannon and Lillian Hamlin was talked of, Joseph F. Smith was named as the priest who had solemnized the offending relation. If it had not been for Smith’s conscious- ness of his own guilt and his knowledge that the whole community was aware of that guilt, he would never have gone to the Tribune office to make such a promise to Mr. Lannan. All of which did not prevent Joseph F. Smith from testifying in the Smoot inves- tigation at Washington in 1904 that he did not marry Abraham Cannon and Lillian llamlin, that he did not have any conversa- tion with my father about tin- marriage, that he did not know Lillian Hamlin had been betrothed to Abraham’s dead brother, that the first time he heard of the charge that he had married them was when he saw it printed in the newspapers!* If this first polygamous marriage had been the last—if it were an isolated and *SfC Proceeding In-fare Srnatf Committee ..r. Priv:|c|jc-S and Elections ly>4. V-l. i.patc* ■	157. etc. peculiar incident, as the Smiths then claimed it was and promised it should be— it might be forgiven as generously now as Mr. Lannan then forgave it. But about the same time there became public another case—that of Apostle Teasdale and, as this narrative shall prove, here was the beginning of a policy of treachery which the present Church leaders, under Joseph F. Smith, have since consistently prac- ticed, in defiance of the laws of the state and the “revelation of God,” with lies and evasions, with perjury and its suborna- tion, in violation of the most solemn pledges to the country, and through the agency of a political tyranny that makes serious prosecution impossible and immu- nity a public boast. The world understands that jKtlygamy is an enslavement of women. The ecclesi- astical authorities in Utah to-day have discovered that it is more powerful as an enslaver of men. Once a man is bound in a polygamous relation, there is no place for him in the civilized world outside of a Mormon community. He must remain there, shielded by the Church, or suiter elsewhere social ostracism and the prose- cution of bigamous relations. Since i.Soo, the date of the manifesto (and it is to the period since iS^o that my criticism solely applies), the polygamist must be abjectly392 Everybody’s Magazine subservient to the Prophets who protect him: he must obey their orders and do their work, or endure the punishment which they can inllict upon him and liis wives and his'children. Inveigled into a plural mar- riage by the authority of a clandestine religious dogma, encouraged by his elders, seduced by the prospect of their favor, and impelled perhaps by a daring impulse to take the covenant and bond that shall swear him into the dangerous fellowship of the lawlessly faithful—he finds himself, at once, a law-breaker who must pay the Church hierarchy for his protection by yielding to them every political right, every personal independence, every freedom of opinion, every liberty of act. I do not believe that Smith fully foresaw the policy which he has since undoubtedly pursued. I believe now, as I did then, that in betraying my brother into polygamy Smith was actuated by his anger against my father for having inspired the recession from the doctrine: that he desired to im- pair the success of the recession by having my brother dignify the recrudescence of polygamy by the apostolic sanction of his participation; and that this participation was jealously designed by Smith to avenge himself ujxm the First Councillor by hav- ing the son be one of the first to break the law and violate the covenant. I saw that my brother’s death had thwarted the con- spiracy. Smith was so obviously fright- ened—despite his pretense of defiance— that I believed he had learned his needed lesson. And 1 accepted the incident as a private tragedy on which the final curtain had now fallen. CHAPTER VIII THE CHURCH AND THE INTERESTS Meanwhile I had been taking part in the Presidential campaign of 1S96, and I had been 011c of the four “insurgent” Repub- lican senators (Teller of Colorado, Dubois of Idaho, Pettigrew of South Dakota, and myself) who withdrew from the national Republican convention at St. Louis, in fulfillment of our obligations to our con- stituents. when we found that the conven- tion was dominated by that confederation of finance in politics which has since come to be called “the System.” I was a mem- ber of the committee on resolutions, and our actions in the committee had indicated that we would probably withdraw from the convention if it adopted the single gold platform as dictated by Senator Lodge of Massachusetts, acting for a group of Repub- lican leaders headed by Platt, of New York, and Aldrich, of Rhode Island. At the most critical point of our con- troversy I received a message from Church headquarters warning me that “we” had made powerful friends among the leading men of the nation and that we ought not to jeopardize their friendship by an incon- siderate insurgency. Accordingly, in bolt- ing the convention, I was guilty of a new defiance of ecclesiastical authority and a new provocation of ecclesiastical vengeance. President Woodruff spoke to me of the matter after I returned to Utah, and I ex- plained to him that I thought the Repub- lican party, under the leadership of Mark Hanna and the flag of the "interests,” had forgotten its duty to the people of the na- tion. I argued, to the President, that of all people in the world we, who had suffered so much ourselves, were most bound to bow to no unfairness ourselves and to oppose the imposition of unfairness ujx>n others. And I talked in this strain to him not be- cause 1 wished his approval of my action, but because I wished to fortify him against the approach of the emissaries of the new Republicanism, who were sure to come to him to seek the support of the Church in the campaign. Some days later, while I was talking with my father in the offices of the Presidency, the secretary ushered in Senator Redfield Proctor, of Vermont. I withdrew, under- standing that he wished to speak in private with President Woodruff and his council- lors. But I learned subsequently that he had come to Salt Lake to persuade the leaders of the Church to use their power in favor of the Republican party throughout the inter-mountain states. Senator Proctor asked me personally what chance I thought the party had in the West. I pointed out that the Republican platform of 1802 had reproached Grover Cleveland for his antagonism to bimetal- lism—“a doctrine favored by the American people from tradition and interest,” to quote the language of that platform—and the Republicans of the inter-mountain states still held true to the doctrine. It had been repudiated by the St. Louis plat-form of June, 1896, and the inter-mountain states would probably refuse their electoral votes to the Republican party because of the repudiation. Senator Proctor thought that the leaders of the Church were powerful enough to control the votes of their followers; and he argued that gratitude to the Republican party for freeing Utah ought to be stronger than the opinions of the people on a merely economic question. 1 reminded him that one of our cove- nants had been that the Church was to refrain from dictating to its followers in politics; that we had been steadily grow- ing away from the absolutism of earlier times; and that for the sake of the peace and progress of Utah I hoped that the leaders would keep their hands off. I did not, of course, convince him. Nor was it necessary’. I was sure that no power that the Church would dare to use would be sufficient at this time to influence the people against their convictions. Joseph F. Smith, soon afterward, noti- fied me that there was to be a meeting of the Church authorities in the Temple, and he asked me to attend it. Since I had never before been invited to one of these conferences in the “holy of holies,” I in- quired the purpose of the conclave. lie replied that they desired to consider the situation in which our people had been placed by my action in the St. Louis con- vention, and to discuss the perceptible trend of public opinion in the state. I saw, then, that Senator Proctor’s visit had not been without avail. On the appointed afternoon, 1 went to the sacred inner room of the Temple, where the members of the Presidency and several of the apostles were waiting. I shall not describe the room nor any of the religious ceremonies with which the conference was opened. I shall confine myself to the dis- cussion—which was begun mildly by Presi- dent Woodruff and Lorenzo Snow, then president of the quorum of apostles. To my great surprise, Joseph F. Smith made a violent Republican speech, de- claring that I had humiliated the Church and alienated its political friends by with- drawing from the St. Louis convention. He was followed by Ileber J. Grant, an apos- tle. who had always posed as a Democrat; and he was as Republican and denuncia- tory as Smith had been. He declaimed against our alienation of the great business interests of the country, whose friendship he and other prominent Mormons had done so much to cultivate, and from whom we might now procure such advantageous co- operation if we stood by them in politics. President Woodruff tried to defend me394 Everybody’s Magazine l>y living that In was sure I had acted con- scientiously; but by this time 1 desired no intervention of prophetic mercy and no mitigation of judgment that might come of such intervention. As soon as the Presi- dent announced that they were prepared tu hear from me, I rose and walked to the farther side of the solemn chamber, with- drawn from the assembled Prophets and confronting them. Having first disavowed any recognition of their right as an ecclesiastical body to direct me in my political actions, 1 re- hearsed the events of the two campaigns in which I had been elected on pledges that I had fulfilled by my course in Congress, in the Senate, and finally in the St. Louis convention. That course had been ap- proved by the people. They hail trusted me to carry out the policies on which they had elected me to Congress. They had reiterated the trust by electing me to the Senate after 1 had revolted against the Republican bond and tariff measures in the lower House. I could not and would not violate their trust now. And there was no authority on earth which I would recognize as empowered to come between the people's will and the people's elected servants. The Prophets received this defiance in silence. Their expressions implied con- demnation, but none was spoken at least not while I was there. President Woodruff indicated that the conference was at an end, so far as I was concerned; and I withdrew. Some attempts were subse- quently made to influence the people dur- ing the campaign, but in a half-hearted way, and vainly. The Democrats carried Utah overwhelmingly; only three Repub- lican members of the legislature were elected out of sixty-three. It was this conference in the Temple which gave me my first realization that most of the Prophets had not, and never would have, any feeling of citizenship in state or nation; that they considered, and would continue to consider, every public i>sue solely in its possible effect upon the fortunes of their Church. My father alone seemed to have a larger view; but he was a statesman of full worldly knowledge; and his e\|terience in Congress, during a part of the " reconstruction period” ami through- out the Tilden-Hayes controversy, had taught him how effectively the national power could assert itself. The others, blind to such dangers, seemed to feel that under Utah’s sovereignty the literal “king- dom of God” fas they regard their Church) was to exercise an undisputed authority. Unable, myself, to take their viewpoint, I was conscious of a sense of transgression against the orthodoxy of their religion. I was aware, for the first time, that, in gain- ing the fraternity of American citizenship, 1 had in some way lost the fraternity of the faith in which I had been reared. 1 ac- cepted this as a necessary consequence of our new freedom—a freedom that left us less close and unyielding in our religious loyalty by withdrawing the pressure that had produced our compactness. And I hoped that, in time, the Prophets them- selves—or, at least, their successors—would grow into a more liberal sense of citizen- ship as their people grew. I knew that our progress must be a process of evolution. I was content to wait upon the slow amend- ments of time. My hope carried me through the dis- heartening incidents of the senatorial cam- paign for the election of Arthur Brown's successor—a campaign in which the power of the hierarchy was used publicly to de- feat the deposed apostle, Moses Thatcher, in his second candidacy for the United States Senate. But the Church only succeeded in defeating him by throwing its influence to Joseph L. Rawlins, whom the Prophets loved as little as they loved Thatcher; and I felt that in Rawlins’s election the state at least gained a repre- sentative who was worthy of it. What was quite as sinister a use of Church influence occurred among the Mor- mons of Idaho, where 1 went to help Sena- tor Fred T. Dubois in his campaign; and for the use of this influence Joseph F. Smith admitted his responsibility, when 1 protested to the Presidency against it. I left for W ashington, soon after, with an unhappy apprehension that there were evil influences at work in Utah which might prove powerful enough to involve the whole community in the worst miseries of reaction. I saw those influences embodied in Joseph F. Smith; and because he was explosive where others were reflective, he had now more influence than previously— there being no longer any' set resistance to him. The reverence of the Mormon people for thc name of Smith was (as it had always been) his chief asset of popularity. Hehad a superlative physical impressiveness and a passion that seemed to take the place of magnetism in public address. But he never said anything memorable; he never showed any compelling ability of mind; he had a personal cunning without any large intelligence; and he was so many removes from the First Presidency that it seemed unlikely he would soon attain to that position of which the power is so great that it only makes the blundering more dangerous than the astute. 1 was going to Washington, before Con- gress reconvened, to confer with Senator Redlicld Proctor. He wished to see me about the new protective tariff bill that was proposed by the Republican leaders. I wished to ask him not to use his political influence in Idaho against Senator Fred T. Dubois, who had been Senator Proctor s political protege. I knew that Senator Proctor had once been given a semi-official promise that the Mormon Church leaders would not interfere in Idaho against Du- Ijois. I wished to tell Proctor that this promise was not being kept, and to plead with him to give Dubois fair play al- though I knew that Senator Dubois's ' in- surgency" had offended Senator Proctor. He received me, in his home in W ash- ington, with an almost paternal kindliness that became sometimes more dictatorial than persuasive—as the manner of an older senator is so apt to be when he wishes to correct the independence of a younger colleague. He explained that the House was Republican by a considerable major- ity; a good protective tariff bill would come from that body; and a careful can- vass of the Senate had proved that the bill would pass there, if I would vote for it. "We have within one vote of a majority,” he said. “As you’re a devoted protection- ist in your views—as your state is for pro- tection—as your father and your people feel grateful to the Republican party for leading you out of the wilderness—I have felt that it was proper to appeal to you and learn your views definitely. If you’ll pledge your support to the bill, we shall not look elsewhere fora vote—but it's essential that we should be secure of a majority." I replied that I could not promise to vote for the measure until 1 should see it. It wa> true that I had been a devoted advo- cate of protection and still believed in the principle; but I had learned something of the way in which tariff bills were framed, and something of the influences that con- trolled the party councils in support of them. I could not be sure that the new measure would be any more just than the original IH’ngley bill, which I had helped to defeat in the Senate; and the way in whichEverybody’s Magazine that !>ill had been driven through the House was a sufficient warning to me not to har- ness mvself in a pledge that might be misused in legislation. Senator Proctor did me the honor to say that he did not suppose any improper sug- gestion of personal advantage could in- fluence me. and he hoped 1 knew him too well to suppose that he would use such an argument. "But.” he added, "anything that it's within the 'political' power of the party to bestow, you may expect; I'm authorized to sav that we will take care of you." As I 'till refused to bind myself blindly, he said, with regret: "We had great hopes of you. It seems that we must look else- where. I will leave the question open. If you conclude to assure us of your vote for the bill. I shall see that you are restored to a place in Republican councils. If I do not liear anything from you. it will be necessary to address ourselves to one or two other senators who are probably available." It is, of course, a doctrine of present-day Republicanism that the will of the majority must rule within the party. An insurgent is therefore an apostate. The decision of the caucus is the infallible declaration of the creed. In setting myself up as a judge of what it was right for me to do. as the sworn representative of the people who had elected me. I was offending against party orthodoxy, as that orthodoxy was then, and is now, enforced in Washington. I was given an opportunity to return to conformity. I was sent a written invitation to attend the caucus of Republican senators after the assembling of Congress; and. with the other “ insurgents,” 1 ignored the invita- tion. It was finally decided by the party leaders to let the tariff bill rest until after the inauguration of the President-elect, W illiam McKinley, with the understanding that he would call a special session to con- sider it; and, in the interval, the Repub- lican machine, under Mark Hanna, was set to work to produce a Republican major- ity in the Senate. Hanna was elected senator, at this lime, to succeed John Sherman, who had been removed to the office of Secretary of State, in order to make a seat for Ilanna. The Republican majority was produced 'Sena- tor Dubois had been defeated.) And when the special session was called, in the spring of 1S07. my vote was no longer so urgently needed. I was invited to a Republican caucus, but 1 was unwilling to return to political affiliations which 1 might have to renounce again; for I saw the power of the business interests in dictating the policy of the party and I did not propose to bow to that dictation. When the tariff bill came before the Senate, I could not in conscience support it. The beneficiaries of the bill seemed to he dictating their own schedules, and this was notably the case with the sugar trust, which had obtained a differential between raw and refined sugar several times greater than the entire cost of refining. I de- nounced the injustice of the sugar schedule particularly. A Mr. Oxnard came to re- monstrate with me on behalf of the beet- sugar industry of the West. "You know," he said." what a hard time we’re having with our sugar companies. Unless this schedule’s adopted I greatly fear for our future.” 1 replied that I was not opj>osing any protection of the struggling industries of the country or of the sugar growers, but I was set against the extortionate differential that the sugar trust was demanding. Everybody knew that the trust had built its tremendous industrial power upon such criminally high protection as this differential afforded, and that its power now affected public councils, obtained improper favors, and terrorized the small competing beet-sugar companies of the West. 1 argued that it was time to rally for the protection of the people as well as of the beet-sugar industry. He predicted that if the differential was reduced, the protection on beet sugar would fail. I laughed at him. "You don't know the temper of the Senate," I said. " Why, even some of the Democrats are in favor of protecting the beet-sugar industry. That part of the bill is safe, whatever hap- pens to the rest." “Senator Cannon,” he replied, with all the scorn of superior knowledge, "you're somewhat new to this matter. Permit me to inform you that if we don’t do our part in supporting the sugar schedule, including the differential, the friends of the schedule in the Senate will prevent us from obtain- ing our protection.” "That,” 1 retorted angrily, “is equiva- lent to sav ing that the sugar trust is writ- ing the sugar schedule. I can’t listen with patience to any such insult. The Senate of the United States cannot be dictated to,Under the Prophet in Utah	397 ir. a matter of such importance, by the trust. I will not vote fur the differential. I will continue to oppose it to the end. ii you're right—if the trust has such power- better that our struggling sugar industry should perish so that wc may arouse thc people to the iniquitous manipulation that destroyed it." I continued to oppose the schedule. Soon after. 1 received a message from the Church authorities asking me to go to New York to attend to some of their financial affairs. I entered live lobby of the Plaza Hotel about nine o'clock .it night; I was met, unexpectedly, by 1'homas R. Cutler, manager of the Utah Sugar Company, who v..i- .1 bishop of the Mormon Church; ami he asked, almost at once, how the tariff bill was progressing at Washington. 1 had known bishop Cutler for years. I knew that he had labored with extraor- dinary zeal and intelligence to establish the sugar industry in Utah. 1 understood THE PONTIFFS HAVE BECOME KINGS OF A CIVIL GOVERNMENT INSTEAD OF PRIMATES OF A RELIGIOUS FAITHE very bod v' s Mugazi ne th.it lie had risked his own property, un- selfishly, to save the enterprise when it was in peril. And 1 had every reason to expect that he would be as indignant as I was at the proposal to use the sup|>ort of the beet-sugarstatosin behalf of their old tyrant. I told him of my conversation with Ox- nard. ''I’m glad." I said, "that we're in- dependent enough to refuse such an alliance with the men who are robbing the country." A peculiar, pale smile curled Bishop Cutler’s thin lips. "Well, Frank." he re- plied, “that’s just what I want to see you about. "We" -with the intonation that is used among prominent Mormons when the “we” are voicing the conclusions of the hierarchy—“wouldn’t like to do anything to hurt the sugar interests of the country. I've looked into this differential, and 1 don't see that it is particularly exorbitant. As a matter of fact, the American Sugar Refining Company is doing all it can to help us get our needed protection, and we have promised to do what we can for it, in return. 1 hope you can see your way clear to vote for the bill. I know that the brethren " meaning the Church authorities—“will not approve of your opposition to it.” 1 understood what his quiet warning meant, and when we had parted 1 went to my room to face the situation. Already I had been told, by a representative of the I’nion Pacific Railway, that the company intended to make Utah the legal home of the corporation, and to enter into a close affiliation with the prominent men of the Church. I had been asked to participate, and I had refused because 1 did not feel free, as a senator, to become interested in a company whose relations with the gov- ernment were of such a character. But I had not foreseen what this affiliation meant. Bishop Cutler’s warning opened my eyes. The Church was protecting itself, in its commercial undertakings, by an alliance with the strongest and most unscrupulous of the national enemies. I saw that this was natural. The Mor- mon leaders had been for years struggling to save their community from poverty. Proscribed by the federal laws, their home industries suffering for want of finances, lighting against the allied influences of business in politics, these leaders had been taught to feel a fearful respect for the power that had oppressed them. They were now being offered the aid and coun- tenance of their old opponents. Our com- munity was to advance to prosperity along the easy road of association with the most influential interests of the country. I remembered the long, hard struggle of our |>eople. 1 remembered the days and nights of anxiety that I myself had known when we were friendless and proscribed. Here was an open door for us, now, to power and wealth and all the comfort and consideration that would come of these. Other men better than I in personal char- acter, more experienced in legislation than I. and wiser by natural gift, were willing to vote for the bill; and Bishop Cutler, a man whom I had always esteemed, the representative of the men whom I most revered, had urged me to support the bill, under suggestion of their anger if 1 refused. 1 saw why the "interests” were eager to have our friendship; we could give them more than any other community of our size in the whole country. In the final analysis, the laws of our state and the ad- ministration of its government would be in the hands of the Church authorities. Moses Thatcher might lead a rebellion for a time, but it would be brief. Brigham 11. Roberts might avow his independence in some wonderful burst of campaign oratory, but he would be forced to fast and pray and see visions until he yielded. I might rebel and be successful for a moment, but the inexorable power of Church control would crush me at last. Yet, if I surrendered in this matter of the tariff, I should be doing exactly what I had criticised so many of my colleagues for doing—for more than one man in the House and the Senate had given me the specious excuse that it was neces- sary to go against his conscience, here, in order to hold his influence and his power to do good in other instances. I did not sleep that night. On the day following, I transacted the financial affairs that 1 had been asked to undertake, and then I returned to Washington. My wife met me at the railway station, and—if you will bear with the intimacy of such psychol- ogy—the moment I saw her I knew how I would vote. I knew that neither the plea of community ambition, nor the equally invalid argument of an industrial need at home, nor the financial jeopardy of my friends who had invested in our home in- dustries, nor the fear of Church antago- nism, could justify me in what would be. forUnder the Prophet in Utah me, an act of perfidy. When I had taken my oath of office, 1 had pledged myself, in the memory of old days of injustice, never to vote as a senator for an act of injustice. The test had come. When the tariff hill came to its final vote in the Senate, I had the unhappy distinc- tion of being the only Republican senator who voted against it. A useless sacrifice! And yet if it had been my one act of public life, i should still be glad of it. The “in- terests” that forced the passage of that bill are those that have since exploited the country so shamefully. It is their control of Republican party councils that has since caused the loss of popular faith in Republicanism and the split in the party which threatens to disrupt it. It is their control of politics in Utah that has de- stroyed the whole value of the Mormon experiment in communism and made the Mormon Church an instrument of political oppression for commercial gain. They arc the most dangerous domestic enemy that the nation has known since the close of the Civil War. My opposition was as doomed as such single independence must always be—but at least it was an opposition. There is a consolation in having been right, though you may have been futile! My father, visiting Washington soon afterward, took occasion to criticise my vote publicly, in a newspaper interview; but he was content, by that criticism, to clear himself and his colleagues of any responsibility for my act. " You made a great mistake,” he told me privately. “You are alienating the friends who have done so much for us.” Many reports soon reached me of at- tacks that were being made U]x>n me by the ecclesiastical authorities, particularly by Joseph F. Smith and Apostle Heber J. Grant. The formal criticism passed upon me by my father was magnified to make my tariff vote appear an inexcusable party and community defection. A vigorous and determined opposition was raised against me. And in this, Smith and his followers were aided by the perfect svstemof Churchcontrol in Utah—a system of complete ecclesiastical tyranny under the guise of democracy. Practically every Mormon man is in the priesthood. Nearly every Mormon man has some concrete authority t<> exercise in addition to holding his ordination as an The N'cxt Instalment <>f elder. Obedience to his superior* i- essen- tial to his ambition to rise to higher dignity in the Church; and obedience to his supe- riors is necessary in order to attract obe- dience to himself from his subordinates. There can be no lay jealousy of priestly interference in politics, because there are no laymen in the proper sense of the word. A man’s worldly success in life is largely involved in his success as a churchman, since thc Church commands the opportuni- ties of enterprise and the leaders of the Church are the state’s most powerful men of affairs. It is not uncommon, in any of our American communities, for men to use their Church membership to support their business; but in Utah the Mormons prac- tically must do so, and even the Gentiles find it wise to be subservient. Add to this temporal power of the Church, the fact that il was establishing a policy of seeking material success for its people, and you have the explanation of its eagerness to accept an alliance with the "interests" and of its hostility to any one who opposed that alliance. The Mormons, dispossessed of their means by the migra- tion from Illinois, had been taught the difficulty of obtaining wealth and the value of it when once obtained. They fancied themselves set apart, in the mountains, by the world's exclusion. They were ambi- tious to make themselves as financially powerful in proportion to their numbers as the Jews were; and it was a common argu- ment among them that the world’s respect had turned to the Jews because of the de- pendence of Christian governments upon the Jewish financiers. The exploitation of this solid mass of in- dustry and thrift could not long be ob- scured from the eyes of the East. The honest desire of the Mormon leaders to benefit their people by an alliance with financial power made them the easy vic- tims of such an alliance. W ith the death of the older men of the hierarchy, the Church administration lost its tradition of religious leadership for the good of the community solely, and the new leaders be- came eager for financial aggrandizement for the sake of power.

VAX DER WEYDE MOLLY, with her hand on the door knob, turned to the two children in the kitchen. Her voice was tender and full uf pain. “Won't you be still, children? Children, won’t you?" Then she softly opened the door and stepped noiselessly into the twilight room. Her husband lay asleep on the bed. stretched flat and fully dressed. She leaned over the breathing, living bulk of man, and brought her tender face close to his hot, fevered cheeks and his rough gray hair. In the darkness he seemed so near, and so far—so real and so unsubstantial. It was at that moment of dusk when people draw close to one another. Molly hesitated. She wanted to pray, and had forgotten how. She looked about the room as if she expected to see some great Power and couldn't find it. She could only say awkwardly: “Please [-lease spare him- and me. I can't l<*se him. I can't I can't.” And then she murmured to herself, all bitterly and brokenly: “I've lost him al- ready.'' She felt swiftly over his soft, warm cotton shirt for his hand: it was as if she were trying to take hold of him and keep him: and then a tear slid dovn to her chin and fell and touched the L«-t. fevered cheek. The man stirred uncomfortably. “You, Moll?” His voice was thick and husky. “Richard!" she cried. She suddenly pushed her arm behind the pillow and drew his head up and kissed him passionately. "Say you love me.” she whispered. There was a deep silence. “Richard!” He did not answer. “ Richard!" And then he suddenly pushed her off, struggled, and sat up. She sank back on her knees, gasping, sobbing, her mind a little wild. “Love!" he muttered. "You've let me oversleep.” He leaned close, menacingly. " I'tw'tr lei me oversleep!” He gripped her arm hard and looked into her face. “Answer me this!” “Yes." she said, in a colorless voice. “ It's time to go to work, ain't it so?” She said nothing. “Damn you—it's time to go to work, ain't it so?" •	Yes.

Get me my supper and be quick about it!” lie added something under his breath as he went reeling into the kitchen. The two children, Nellie and Bob, playing in a cor- ner, stopped when they saw him and .slid out the back door into the evening. “You better get out,’’ he muttered. Then he sank all in a lump in a kitchen chair and leaned his head on the oilcloth covered table. His fingers ran through his rough gray hair; and his lean face, with its burning blue eyes and knotty, flushed cheeks, and big lips, was half shadowy, half starting out in the gaslight above him. Be- hind him the shiny black stove was breath- ing up heat about a sputtering coffeepot and a pan of potatoes. There were chairs and a cupboard, two windows and a door—a neat, compact room. Molly came in quietly, her face very pale. She poured off a cup of coffee, lightened it with milk, and set it before him. Then she hesitatingly pushed some potato slices on a plate and set it beside the coffee. He roughly pushed the plate aside. “Take it away—fool!" She took it away quickly. "Get me the sug. r!"

And he began sip- ping the coffee slowly. She stood silent, and llu-n she drew up a chair and sat at the table beside him. She made up her mind then to keep him from the mill at any cost. She spoke quietly: "You're sick; you’re not going to work to-night." "Who's going to stop me?" "W\ He gave her a quick glance. " You, eh? ” She leaned toward him, and lowered her voice. "I've been silent years—now I’m going to speak.” He clenched his fists, and loosed his quick temper again. "Shut up! My God, you woman-" Then she broke in with a sharp cry: “See!

In the thi* k. warm silence they heard the chil- dren laughing :is they ran alter each other. “ Richard," said Molly softly, "you’re not even a decent father any more." He sipped again at the coffee. “And you think." she went on. "that a woman can stand for anything. She can't —she won't! Go any farther "—she paused and spaced the words—“go—any—farther— and I'll leave you." He went on sipping coffee, and then sud- denly he took a deep breath, expanding his chest, and rested his head in his hand. “Who does the work, eh?” “ I guess I do as much as you,” said Molly. “Well,” he muttered sullenly, “who brings in the money?" “ You do.” “Thirty-live dollars a week." “ Well,” he muttered, " what more do you want?” She gave a strange, short laugh, and looked down at the floor. “It might do for a man,” she breathed, “but not for a woman, and you know it." “Know what?" "Oh -nothing!” He began sipping his coffee again. And then her heart seemed to crack open, and the terrible pang shot through her throat and to her lips and she cried: “ Richard—you don't love me! You don’t love me any more!” His mouth opened to speak, but he said nothing. He looked at her with a tragic sullenness, a bitter defiance. "Richard,” she cried again, “your work's come between us. You—a man of thirty- live—your hair’s gray!" He started to speak again, but said nothing. She leaned closer, and spoke her heart out, the words lashing him. "The steel mill's killing you. It’s the twelve-hour day. Twelve hours a day fora whole week—and then twelve hours for seven nights. Seven nights you don't sleep with me. I never see you more than an hour at a time, and then you're dead tired.” She raised her voice to a quivering cry: “It’d been better if we’d a’ been found dead in each other’s arms the night after we married, when we knew there was a God in this world! Our children were damned, not born!” The door opened softly then, and a little, thin girl, with tossing brown curls, ran in to her mother. “Mugger! Mugger!” The mother drew the little one close and patted a cheek, and spoke in a low. dry voice: "Yes. Nellie.” “Mugger—come out and see what we got!” “I can’t now—please, Nellie, run along!” “But, Mugger-” "Run along! Please, please!" The little girl went out slow ly, stilling quick, tiny sobs. Molly turned a face infinitely sad upon her husband, and spoke in a voice tender with pain: “This isn’t a home for our children. It’s no home where the man only eats and sleeps, “How much a week?" 1-A BORERS IIOVKRKI) ADOl'T. \\|> As rill.

Oh,” she paused, clenched her fists, and half closed her eyes, “when I think it's our chil- dren going to waste like this—and they so full of things that might Ik- turned to good— and something so sweet in them- She slopped, staring into a terrible future. ••It's all the twelve-hour day." she mut- tered. "It makes the men cogs in the mills —no more. That's what you are. You’re not a man; you’re a cog." He cleared his throat; he shuffled his feet; he drew a little nearer, and at last his voice- rose. trembling: “Anything else, eh?" She looked suddenly straight in his eyes, and kept his gaze. Then she spoke in a voice that had lightning in it—that seemed to stab through him like a long needle. “Yes—you and I have lived as if there weren't any God. and you’ve lost your soul, Richard, you’ve lost your soul. You can't love any more, and you don't live. You’re a cog." His face struggled violently, he opened and closed his mouth.

Molly leaped up with a low cry. rushed to the door, and stood with an arm across it. Her fact "as white with agony. ‘‘You're not going,” she murmured breathlessly. ‘Not?" He advanced toward her. “Dick,” she cried, “you're not going!" He seized her two arms and pushed her aside, ojiened the door, and stepped out. She gave a wild cry. that called the children home, as he slammed the door and reeled down the street. The evening was chilly, making him shiver, and in the smoky air street-lamps burned dimly about him. He turned the corner and walked down a street. On one side, at the end of the street, stood the black wall of the mill grounds, on the other the smoke- blackened mill houses, each set in a cinder- dead soil that never bloomed. Richard felt sick, utterly sick. He reeled through the smoky air, turned a corner be- fore the library, and crossed a bridge into the mill grounds. Many other men were hurrying with him. As they went on, suddenly I heir grim faces were splashed by far fires and strange lights. They began step- ping over intricate tangles of railway tracks in the yards, and all the time their faces shone brighter. Yet not a man of them took any interest, though all about them was one of the sublime scenes of America. They did not seem to see the shining tracks, the glistening red and green lanterns, the mills glowing through their windows like buildings eaten with lire, the tongues of flames through the roofs, the vast swirls of blaze and rerl-shuddering smoke clouds, and the thousand chimney pipes looking through the changing lights. Through all this, among the buildings, over the rails, in the thick of a roar of machinery, a thunder and thirr and crash of tools, a confusion of yard- engines, shrieking up and down with little flat-cars, a hurry of lanterns—through it all, the men moved silently, dully, lit on every side, their black, greasy overalls glistening as they moved. Richard entered a large, square building where the sloping, many-beamed roof was in huge shadows. Set in the solid masonry of the floor were steel trapdoors. A man, grasping a lever, stood in front of one of these, just as an overhead crane, like a bridge running down the room, came whiz- zing along. From the crane hung sus- pended a huge steel hand. 11 stopped above the man; he at once pulled the lever, and the trapdoor at his feet opened like a huge mouth, revealing the “soaking pit.” This was a well of fire—white-hot—intolerable to the eye. Nor could the flesh come near it. But the huge steel hand never faltered. It reached down into the very hell of fire, and slowly drew out a dazzling, sizzling, white-hot, ten-ton ingot of stcei. This it bore down the room and shoved on to steel rollers that ran off into the adjoining room. Richard entered this next room. At his side the rollers,one next to theother in a long path, were turning, and the ingot slid over them, and made straight for a huge “clothes wringer” that stood in its path. Suddenly it hit this steel-wringer with a loud “spla!” —there was a shower of sparks, and it went through with a wild “klong-a-a-1”—like the howl of a hungry lioness. The great wringer pressed the steel out, but no sooner had it emerged on the other side, longer and flatter, than it was shot back, and so, back, and forth, until it was thinned into a long, wide ribbon of steel, and was rolled away to the next room to be cooled and sheared. Laborers hovered about the immense and intricate wringer, and as the blazing ingot passed their faces and forms came and went sharp and shadowy. Two men stood at op- posite sides on a little platform above the “wringer.” each with his hand on a lever. One controlled the direction of the rolls, the other the force of the pressure. Richard relieved the man at the pressure-lever, and at once his work began. It was one of the most terrible nights of his life. He was sick; he could hardly hold his head straight; and yet he had to have a clear eye, a steady hand, and infinite pa- tience. His gaze never left the hurrying ingot, and he had to gauge its thickness and what it would stand. Each time it drew near, it shot over him a consuming heat that burnt and smothered and made the flesh tingle intolerably. Ordinarily he would not have felt this, but to-night he was sick. TheThe Cog glare, too. hurl his eyes, and the slecl lever got hot under his gloves. There was no breathing spell. Ingot fol- lowed ingot without pause. He pulled the lever, and then, with the wild “klong-a-a-l," a shower oi sparks, a smell of powder, the ingot was squeezed. The speed was territic and grew worse, (or the little foreman had given out the impression that his men must pile up a record and beat the output of the other mills. And the responsibility was what made a man old—for it anything went wrong, if an ingot was spoiled or thc mill stopped, the money loss to the workers, as well as to the mill, was very large-, for the men were paid by the ton. Hour followed hour, and Richard pressed the lever down or pulled it up, his face twisted with thc torture of the toil, every nerve, every muscle strained and alert and in action. His head now and then went dizzy and his face paled. Whenever he winked he saw a red ingot sliding back and forth. And worst of all. his heart was in wild and new revolt. He heard the cry of his wife her word* kept beating tin- .li his brain. Sii k and de-prr.iir and gling, he «ould ii"t shun : • i«-	J|. knew that everything >h. h.<-l -...

NTow by a mighty effort he saw clearly again the hovering laborers all sharp and shadowy, the advancing ingot, the gloomy, dark wringer, the menac- ing heights above him. Hut Molly kept saying: “Richard, you don’t love me any more—you don't love me!” So he gave the lever a good jam. There was a weird, unusual crash, a splutter, and a dozen men roared together. The rolls stopped, and in the queer silence Richard saw clearly again. He had jammed an ingot and broken a coupling sleeve. A sickening horror went through him. It meant the loss of an hour’s time. He had tied up the whole mill. And all the other workers would lose in their wages, too. All the men of the section came rushing toward him, shouting angrily. And then suddenly the little foreman came dancing up. The little fellow swung a fist in Richard's face, and shrieked: “ I >amn you—damn you! Just as we're piling up a tonnage-record! I'll trim you for this-” Then suddenly fifteen years of silent pres- sure blew off. Demons raged in Richard’s heart, his brain went hot. With his power- ful hands he gripped the little foreman by the throat. "You damned little pusher,” he snapped, “go to hell!" The foreman choked and sput- tered as he was re- leased, and the ring of workmen stifled their smiles. Then the foreman backed away,muttering: “I suppose you know what this means?” " Yes." said Rich- ard, “it means good- night!” He turned and walked off quietly. He went out into the yards. A brown dawn was searching its way through the swirling smoke, and in the vague light all the confusion and stir of the yards went on. Hut it never stopped, neither day nor night, through the years. The sick man, hot from the flames, trembled in the chilly air of the morning. His head, however, was acutely clear. He saw all about him. It must have been the blood in him. he reasoned. He came of old American stock—men and women who had given up the comfort and ease of home and followed their God to worship Him in the West—there in sweat, poverty, and hardship finding a freedom for the soul. He, too. could make the sacrifice. He, too. could go West. The West still called the freeman. The mighty farmlands needed labor—the Northwest needed pio- neers. There, too, was room for little chil- dren and sun and wind and a green space for the soul. He was astonished to find how calmly he took it all. He felt as if he had left him- self in the mill, and was a different man. A world slid off his shoulders. He was free; his lips were loosed. In one stroke he had regained his manhood. For years the mills had muzzled him, worked him, sweated him, flung him out for a sleep and a bite, pulled him back into the machinery, taken from him his home, his friends, his books, his church, his leisure, his citizenship, his free WITH HIS POWERFUL HANDS HE GRIPPED TIIE LITTLE F<)KK\IAV HV TIIE THROAT.The speech—and wasted the man that might have been. X'ow he had jerked himself free. He reached the street. The wind was blowing away, and the skies were clear abo\ e him. He looked up. He beheld the fading stars. And suddenly he stood still,- and a wave of glory swept over him. Something broke within him -some crust about his heart—and like a revelation he was charged with light. The glad tears came to his eyes. He felt that he was beginning to live, lie- wanted to open his lips that his open heart might send its glory into words. He heard the wind singing about him, he heard the night-world laboring, the engines puffing, the mills roaring; he saw the lights of the street and human beings beneath them. His heart went out to the great world. And then, as he went on, with fresh tides of life pouring through him. his soul went out to his own. He thought of his own children, he thought of his own wife. He marveled at the strange years he had just been through—he marveled at the miserable father and husband he had been. The father-passion, long numb, awoke and struck his heart: his man's love for this woman made him yearn with tenderness. And the glory bore him along like a boy in love. He turned up the dim street—the house was alight. He stepped around to the rear and pushed open the kitchen door and en- tered very softly. Molly was building a City	407 lire in the stove.

OTHER PLAYS BY • HARTLEY • DAVIS FEW productions in New York have* been that his work is not to be lightly treated, more universally or more respectfully con- even by dramatic critics, demned than “ Alary Magdalene,” in which This Biblical play was presented in the Olga Ncthersole appeared as the star. The New Theatre, although not under the dis- position of Maurice Maeterlinck is such tion of its management. In the beauty and 40SThe Players splendor of ihe stage setting and Costuming, and the careful consideration of artistic de- tail, it was entirely worthy of that temple of art. Moreover, it was accompanied by wonderful music, based on Oriental and Hebraic melodies, composed by Modest Altschuler, and played by tin- Russian Sym- phony Orchestra under his direction. To these tilings the critics gave the high praise that was their due. But to me the play they found so dull was far greater than these artistic accessories—indeed, the most impressive play I have ever seen. Perhaps, as the critics maintained, there are only two dramatic moments in the drama, if it be measured by the Broadway standard, or even by the rules of pure technique. To me, however, these seemed but pale shad- ows of unreal things beside the majestic power of that greatest, most wonderful, most splendid drama in all history. These two theatric scenes did not give me the thrill which came with the simple an- nouncement that the house of Simon the leper, where Christ stayed in Bethany, was just a little way from the mansion of Silanus, whose splendors were before one's eyes. And when Silanus, truly a noble Roman and a philosopher, talked of Simon and his family, of the coming and going of the Nazarene, in simple, kindly, neighborly fashion, I felt that if 1 were in the garden of Silanus, I, too, could see the house of Simon the leper and the coming and going of the Nazarene. This compelling illusion of nearness brought with it a reverent awe that was al- most suffocating. I fear that, to most of us, the story of Christ, familiar as it is, seems something far off, dimmed by the mist of years, and we grasp as in a dream conventionalized forms of an idea that has small reality for us. For me, this play made the story vivid—real. So il was that, when the love of the sjk-c- tacular Lucius for the gorgeously bedizened Mary Magdalene was shown, I was thinking of the house of Simon the leper, and of Him who lived there. Thc characters who played Ixvi the Publican, Cleophas, the Mon Cured of Dropsy, and all the others meant nothing more to me than had their names. Nor was I impressed when the voice of the Nazarene was heard, the voice that drew Mary Magdalene into the crowd only to be attacked and stripped of her finery. Even when I heard the voice proclaim: “Let him who is without sin among you i't tlx. :ir~i stone." I was unmoved, though (hi- -un- . according to Constituted Authority. ■ of the two great dramatic muim. me there was no illusion in that voi«e. 1 knew it belonged to an actor, not t" thc Nazarene. Yet He seemed somewhere mar, and presently He would return to the house of Simon the leper, jusl around the corner, and if 1 were in the garden of Silanus I could see Him. That is the reason why it was of small concern whether or not the Magdalene loved the ardent Lucius. He was interesting only as representing the altitude of his Roman government toward the Nazarene and His followers. That the heart of the courtesan should have been touched by the Nazarene seemed natural enough; but I could not be interested in the blind, ignorant, human jealousy of the young Roman, and it is upon this, from a technical standpoint, that the whole play revolves. The background over- whelms that which takes place before one’s eyes, and without this background the play holds nothing to lift it above the common- place. The vital thing is that in “Mary Magdalene” one is brought almost face to face with the living, breathing Saviour of Man. Especially i> this true in the second act, and never before had 1 realized how mar- velous is the thaumaturgy of the stage, the possibilities of its illusion, because 1 never had known anything in the theatre so over- poweringly dramatic. Silanus and Appius have come to the home of Mary Magdalene in a turmoil of emotions that have stirred their souls beyond belief. They have just looked upon the greatest of all the miracles -the raising of Lazarus from the dead. They describe what has taken place before their very eyes. .1 ppius, hard-headed, prac- tical man of affairs, to whom seeing is be- lieving, accepts what he has seen as a miracle, and can find no words to express the wonder of it. Silanus, the philosopher, without trying to discredit the evidence of his senses, seeks vainly for some explanation that will satisfy himself. They have stood face to face with something mightier than their imaginations. They speak with the simple, lofty eloquence of the Gospels— indeed, nearly the whole of the eleventh chapter of John is woven into the dialogue. I had a conviction, stronger than any illu- sion the stage has ever given me, that I was4"' Evcrylxxly’s Magazine* hearing at liisl hand the stories of eye- witnesses of Lazarus's resurrection. The illusion was complete without the appear- ance of Lazarus, clad in his white death- clothes, the stamp of the grave on his worn, pallid face. Straight from his sepulcher he came and was among us. When he sum- moned Mary Magdalene in the name of the Master, one felt that all the powers of earth could not stay her. least of all the passion of Lucius. So nil-pervading, so profound was the veloped, and it appears to reach a great climax. But on the stage the illusion of the mighty thing beyond crushes it into noth- ingness. So it seems plain that one may not judge this play by the familiar canons of the drama, any more than by the Broadway standard. It is too big, too significant. That Olga Nethersole played Mary Mag- dalene meant little to me. This was as true of her fine moments as of her irritating ones, and it was only with an effort that I was WIXTIIROI-, JANE OAKER, HAMILTON REVELLE, A. E.

The idea of Lucius trying to barter the safety of the Xazarene for Mag- dalene seemed so futile, so pitifully weak. One cannot conceive of these little humans staying the magnificent tragedy of Calvary. When one reads the play, it is the last act that seems the most powerful and im- pressive. It is finely constructed and de- conscious of either. She makes one feel that she was intended to be a really great actress, but that, by her own foolish affecta- tions and the pettiness of her ideas, she has thwarted the career open to her. But one was splendidly conscious of Arthur Forrest as Silanus, for he rose to fine heights. He was worthy of the play. He had the im- pressive dignity of one who was noble by nature as well as by rank, and who was truly a philosopher. His diction was almostEvcryl >«>dy’s Magazine feet .mil the spirit of the plnv was in him. And Charles Hanford, too. I liked as Ap- piu\. for there was in his portrayal whether •t was by accident or design is of small mo- ment .1 touch of motlernity that hel|>ed to bridge over the chasm of years. .Much of tht honor for the presentation of the play belongs to Hugh Ford, who staged it, and Who won a triumph that will long endure. The production of " Mary Magda- l. ne" saved the first part of the theatrical season in New York from the common- place. There had been a marked lowering of the standard established in the two pre- ceding seasons, especially in the value of the themes. The number of failures during the first half of the season was extraordinarily large, and the successes, with one or two exceptions, presented nothing significant in the way of new ideas or the interpretation of familiar ones. Those who have been lifting their voices for American drama have derived much encouragement from the wholesale failure of foreign plays, which means that Charles Frohman, their chief purveyor, has suffered severely. The truth, however, is that: these plays failed, not so much because they were foreign, although that always is a factor, as because they were bad, measured by an American standard. For we are gradually developing an American standard, although it is still nebulous. The unprofitableness of the early season cannot be charged to errors of judgment on the part of the public, which has been more than generous in several instances; for while there has been no failure that was not justified, there have been successes not wholly deserved. Not only has an amazing •lumber of piffling plays been presented, but I	can recall no season in which so many players have been hopelessly miscast. The New Theatre started its regular sea- son with a failure due to this miscasting malady. Never have 1 seen a more beauti- ful production than that of "The Merry Wives of Windsor," from the viewpoint of scenery and costuming. The last scene of ■‘II- m Windsor Park, with the misty moon- light in the trees, and the rollicking mas- queraders in their diaphanous robes, was the most exquisitely lovely thing I have ever seen on the stage. It alone almost made the whole production worth while. Hut it was badly acted, in a subdued, low- pressure key. dragging its dull length to that last beautiful scene. Surely had Ben Jonson seen this production he would not have written—“Never yet had a spectator who did not think it too soon ended.” “The Merry Wives of Windsor” is pure farce, and not all of it is lively and amusing in this day. Tradition has it that Queen Elizabeth, whose reputation for virtue was higher than for taste—both being exaggerated, prob- ably—was so delighted with Sir John Fa!- staff that she commanded Shakespeare to write a comedy showing the fat knight in love and ordered that it be finished in four- teen days. Subsequently this farce, the result, was rewritten and enlarged. None of the players who took part in the presentation gained the slightest prestige, which goes to show that the New Theatre has not yet been able to gather or to train actors who are perfectly at home in blank verse. On the heels of the failure of the Shake- spearean play, the New Theatre company gave “The Thunderbolt,” Sir Arthur Wing Pinero’s latest production, which, be- cause of its failure in London, no American manager cared to produce; and it scored a triumph, the remarkably fine acting being a compelling factor. There is no question that Pinero is the foremost living dramatist writing in Eng- lish, a master of his craft, who deals in ideas. He has profound knowledge of the laws that govern the play’, but often, like some great corporation lawyers, he makes use of this knowledge to circumvent the laws. In all his later plays—that is, those w ritten since the firm establishment of his fame and fortune—the dominant notion is a flaying of the English middle class. He is so merci- lessly bitter that one suspects he is seeking to avenge some injustice suffered in his struggling days. “His House in Order" was severe enough, but it does not compare with “The Thunderbolt” either as a philip- pic or as a drama. This latest play, per- haps the best constructed that Pinero has written, is far from perfect, because both actual truth and dramatic truth are sacri- ficed to the flagellation of the sordid ugliness of the characters. It failed in London be- cause national resentment of the convinc- ing fidelity of the scenes was so strong that the interest in the really dramatic develop- ment of the story could not overcome it. In New York the audiences laughed at the portrayal of concentrated meanness andOLGA NETHERSOLK IN THE TITLE ROLE OF MAETERLINCK'S " MARY MAGDALENE."414	Everybody’ were re.nl) l<> receive the real <lranta with unbiased minds. The story is about an English provincial family, deadly respectable, shabby genteel, unspeakably narrow and sordid, whose chief concern is the distribution of the money left by a dead brother who made a fortune as a brewer, and who would have nothing to do with his family until he was on his death- bed. While the dead brother lies upstairs, the members of the family mingle hypocrit- ical grief with wolfish interest 111 his money and anxiety about a will. For thc dead man has left in Paris an illegitimate daugh- ter of whom he was very fond, and the nat- ural supposition is that most of his fortune is left to her. But no will can be found; and if there is none, the large fortune must be divided among the brothers and sister. The thunderbolt descends when, by a manifestation of dramatic power that is Pinero at his best, it is shown that there was a will and that it was destroyed by Phyllis Morlimore, the wife of one of the brothers —the only decent one. Her motive was to save herself from the cruel operation of a certain class distinction—a distinction al- most impossible for Americans to grasp. Her father was a grocer, and her husband's family, in their consciousness of superiority, had inflicted upon her a succession of petty persecutions. Il	seemed to me that the scene in which the guilty wife makes confession to her hus- band failed of the effect it should have had because Thais Lawton, who played the role, did not rise to its possibilities. From this point on there is powerful, moving, absorb- ing drama. Although A. E. Anson, as the decent Thaddeus Morlimore, played with little discrimination, he could not seriously detract from the gripping interest in the scene in which he appeared before his brothers and the lawyers and took upon his own shoulders the burden of his wife's crime, only to be trapped because his tale was so ill prepared. In all of Pinero’s many plays there is nothing so fine as this scene. And the interest carries into the last act. when the lawyers suggest an equitable though hardly legal solution, carefully withdrawing so that it may be carried out. Then one sees something of the real char- acter of the Moriimores, although Pinero is at little pains to develop it; and the struc- tural weakness of the play lies in the fact that these important revelations are held 5 Magazine back until the very end. If one thinks a little, it becomes plain that the unspeakable meanness of the Morlimore family is not wholly of their own choosing. Like most of us, they are largely the victims of circum- stance, of conditions they had not the strength lo overcome. Especially is this true of James Morlimore, the head of the family, who dominates all the rest. Back of his vulgarity, his lust for money, is a certain rugged sense of honesty and fairness that makes one respect him this seems to be a concession that Pinero the dramatist de- manded from Pinero the man. If the real truth about the Morlimores were shown at the beginning, "The Thunderbolt ” would be a much stronger and much finer play; but the author could not have fed so fat the ancient grudge he bears the English middle classes. Never have I seen a finer characteriza- tion than Louis Calvert’s James Morlimore. Never has any player given me a more per- fect sense of reality. It did not seem like acting at all. He lived the character. As perfect in their way were the portrayals of Albert Bruning, as Stephen Morlimore, and Ferdinand Gottschalk as Colonel Pouting —indeed, this is the best characterization that Mr. Gottschalk has given in the New Theatre, while E. M. Holland and Ben John- son played the lawyers so effectively that one realizes how greatly real acting in small parts can add to a performance. Not since she appeared in “ Naughty An- thony,” the first comedy that David Belasco wrote—and the only one, I believe—has Blanche Bates departed from an emotional role until this season. In “Nobody's Widow ” she has scored the greatest finan- cial success of her career. The comedy —really it is more a farce—is thc lightest, flimsiest thing, with some extremely clever dialogue. Its spirit is essentially French, and one feels that the Parisian writers, who are infinitely more skillful than any others in this sort of thing, would have made more of the idea. There is no question that Blanche Bates delights her audiences. She is too good an actress to fail in anything; but she is not a comedienne, and the hyper- critical, at least, feel that she is lacking in a delicate finesse, in the exquisite touch of evanescent humor that is the soul of high comedy. But we have very little high comedy on the stage nowadays, and only one high comedienne, Henrietta Crosman, in America.DOROTHY PARKER. T. WIGNEY PERCYVAL. AND EDGAR KENT IN' "POMANDER WALK"IARIE JOk.I AS l-.UU.IXl; 1■II7.1//S/.1' IS " El.SCTRICITYThe Players 4»7 The chief charm of " Nobody’s Widow," which was written by Avery llopwood, lies in the fact that it appears to be exceedingly naughty, while, as a matter of fact, it is highly moral. The heroine, having decided tu separate from her titled British husband, announces the fact that sin- is a widow. Then the husband appears and determines to make her come back to him. And this oilers opportunity for some delicious scenes, especially when the husband persists in making a midnight visit to her boudoir. Bruce McRae, who plays the husband, seems to have a keener notion of the whim- sical humor of the farce than docs the star. He acts the part brilliantly. "The Cub,” by Thompson Buchanan, in which Douglas Fairbanks is the star, is an extraordinarily clever satire on the Ken- tucky feud, and it keeps the audiences in roars of laughter from the rise of the curtain to the end. Possibly it would be more suc- cessful as a play if there were less laughter in it. But the chief weakness is that the character of the hero, an inexperienced cub reporter sent to investigate a feud, is not defined. One laughs at him more than with him, which doesn’t make for financial suc- cess, and to the very end one isn't sure whether he has courage or whether he merely hasn't sense enough to l>e afraid. And those familiar with the cocksureness of Mr. Fairbanks and the bubbling, aggressive youth of him can realize how he accentuates the fundamental weakness of the play. After a long absence May Irwin returned to the New York stage to prove again that 110 one can quite take her place, because of her homely,simple, honest, rollicking humor, which is as irresistible as it is spontaneous, Booth Tarkington and Harry Leon Wilson have provided her with an elementary ve- hicle—"Getting a Polish”—that displays her powers to fine advantage—and nothing more is necessary. It is amusing that these two highly intellectual, forceful, brilliant men, who have won real literary distinction, should shine as authors of home-cooking drama; but the huge royalty returns must salve their pride. Apart from May Irwin as Mrs. Jim, the comedy doesn’t amount to much. It is just a jolly evening's entertainment for people who want to laugh. This description is true also of William Collier in " i'll Be Hanged If I Do," of which lie and Edgar Selwyn are the authors. Originally a one-act skit, two more acts have been tacked on to ii in rather hap- hazard fashion, and the three hang together 011 the slenderest thread. But Mr. Collier has provided himself with innumerable bright lines, which lie reads in his own in- imitable way, with his deadly serious face. For instance, when a young woman to whom he had been engaged says: "If 1 had mar- ried you I should have committed suicide,” he retorts: "You would have fallen on my dead body." Really, a William Collier play is a monologue that changes from season to season, with actors to give it back- ground and to allow the star to change his clothes. Mr. Collier is always delightfully the same. Years ago Oscar Hammerstein built a great amusement place which included a big music hall he called the Olympia, a theatre called the Criterion, and a roof garden. Financial stress came upon him, and he lost the building with everything else. Sturdily he set to work to make another fortune out of inventions and again appeared as a factor in amusements, eventually becoming an in- ternational figure by establishing a grand opera company that was a rival of the Metropolitan. When that institution gave Mr. Hammerstein some millions to retire from the grand opera field, he had among his singers a tiny, vivacious little Italian with a wonderful soprano voice much bigger than she—Emma Trentini. He decided to exploit her in light opera, so Rida Johnson Young was commissioned to write what proved to be a silly book and Victor Herbert to compose some of the finest music he has given to light opera. Also Mr. Hammerstein had for "Naughty Marietta" a new tenor—a young man from Indiana, who is said to have been "dis- covered" and brought to the impresario’s attention by Gus Edwards, writer of pop- ular songs. In any case, Orville Harrold is a very remarkable tenor, and is expected to make a real sensation in grand opera, whither he is bound. The little Trentini, with her wonderful \ ivacity, her naive, whole-souled enthusiasm, and her wonderful voice; the Herbert music, the new tenor; and the fine acting of F.d- ward Martindel united to make a wonderful triumph for Mr. Hammerstein. And this in the Olympia, renamed the New York, whose doors he had never entered since he left it as the owner.LITTLE STORIES OF REAL LIFE THE CHILDREN’S SPECIALIST BY D O. EDSOX loin- ------ ' —. ------ OHN SMITH to the bar.” At these words the mass that congested thecourt room stirred expectantly. A mo- ment before, just as Smith entered the great double doors, a voice had shouted something that he didn't quite catch. Now the officers, scattered about the room, called in offensive tones: "Stand up! Hats off!”—and—“Here, you. over there, take off your hat!" From the rear of the room, Smith could easily see over the heads of the intimidated crowd. The judges, gowned in black, were making their dignified way to the bench. “John Smith to the bar!” With his hat in his hand, Smith started. One of the officers in the rear of the room, seeing him trying to worm his way forward, called, “Come, hurry up," and then, to the crowd immediately in front, “Make way there!” To save the contents of his bulging over- coat pockets, Smith put on his hat and pushed and pulled his way into the crowd. His elbow caught a stout person in the spare rib. The fat one turned with a look of sudden resentment to behold a smooth- shaven, rosy-cheeked, broad-shouldered boy with hair slightly sprinkled with gray. The expression on the fat man's face changed. Fat or thin, men whom Smith jostled glared 41S first, then saw his face, and—stopped glaring. They always did. As he neared the officer, where the crowd was not so great, Smith removed his hat. just as that functionary again shouted “Take off your hat!” He turned and smiled a full-moon smile right in the officer’s face and said, “I beat you to it. I had it off first.” Some one laughed—the officer frowned,growled “ Hur- ry up,” and pointed to the little gate that separated the trial end of the room from the “free and equal” who never missed a trial. The clerk of the court, having been kept waiting fifteen seconds, -called crossly. "Come on.” The officer who stood guard at the little gate, which opened and closed like a laugh at the “free and equal” joke in the Declara- tion of Independence, gave him a shove as he passed through, and said, “Hurry up." As he entered the enclosure, willing hands guided Smith with turn and push, frown and nod, until he found himself at the foot of the platform, facing the impatient clerk. “ You are charged with exceeding the speed limit with your automobile—Wot- yougottosay? Have you counsel?" It sounded so like a German sentence that Smith’s face lit up with that full-moon smile, and he said: “What’s that?” The impatient clerk frowned. “Are you guilty or not guilty?” “ I don’t know. I should like to hearThe Children's Specialist what the cop says ahnut it. 1 have th:t privilege, have I not? And I don't need a lawyer. You’ll treat me all right." The big, boyish voice, clear and steady, tilled the room; the prisoner's round, smil- ing face was looking up at the thin and peevish face of the clerk; their eyes met. Slowly the frown melted from i hr clerk's face until he was giving back, in the wa\ <>f a smile, the best he could do. Jt was not Smith's smile alone, but the whole face. “Certainly," said the clerk, and, turning to the judges, he added: "The case goes on for trial." There was some shuffling of papers and .1 whisper or two between the judges. The clerk called some names from the long li>i he held in his hand, ending in a singsong voice: "All other cases on the calendar will re- turn to-morrow at ten o'clock without fur: tlur notice." Hang!—thc gavel came down with a crash. "Gee!"—Smith started. “Silence!" roared the clerk. "Are they all deaf?" Smith asked the clerk, pleasantly. Noth- ing but his smile saved him. "Officer John Donnelly take thc stand!” It war- still the impatient clerk speaking. Smith now stepped down from the platform and stood among the legal talent, rejvirters. and thc “free and equal, who had the look of ex- pecting some invisible power to descend upon them. The moon-faced, nd-cheeked smile had been contemplating the t luce dignified judges. I le now turned and saw "hi.' friend, the enemy" seated ii: the witness chair, twirl ing his cap between hi' I nces. He would hardly have known him for the hard-faced arbiter of the law of yesterday, s** gentle and refined was he now, his blond head tipped to one side in becoming humility. A clean-cut young : llow from thedistric t attorney's office next stepped i' -rward with a bundle of legal document.-*. "Officer! " He wa- looking over the papers in his hand. Then he .said "Ahem!" quite importantly. A lump suddenly appealed in the cheek of the officer in the witness chair. The clerk saw it. “Take il out! Take it out'" he growled. The officer’s hand went to his mouth and the lump disappeared in his pocket. “Officer" the assistant district attorney had found the paper lu was looking for. 1'he room became quiet. "On thc ’’ml instant, you arrested one John Smith for violation of the speed ordinance.” All eyes were now turned 011 “one John Smith." Also.every face that looked upon “one John Smith" wa> smiling.

A pair of white cloth leg*., round and piump, poked from his right-hand pocket, while from the left a yellow, frowsy head, with one eye pushed in, rested its rosy cheek luxuriously against his warm, well-titling overcoat. The inside pocket also bulged. ” oNK or MY PATII MTS, JUDGE. OM I \ i: mini-..

Evidently the task wasn’t pan- ning out as he had expected. “You see. 1 was riding in the park on me bicycle, when an automobile whizzed by me going like—er—very fast." He stopped to wipe his mouth with the back of his hand. It had been a narrow escape. He went on: "1 took me stop-watch from me pocket, and timed him for two blocks, and found he was going twenty-two and a half miles an hour, so 1 put him under arrest." “One minute. Officer." the assistant dis- trict attorney interrupted. "Did he say anything to you?" “ Yes, sir; he said he was a doctor and had a lot of sick people to see." "Is that all. Officer?” “That's all he said." “AH he said/ Well, what did he do?" "Oh, just laughed—with his face like that." The officer pointed at Smith, and smiled like the rest. The smile had spread with alarming rapidity. "Is that all. Officer?" "Yes, sir." Turning to the big, benign face with the smile, the attorney asked. "Do you want to ask any questions, Doctor?" "No, sir. I just wanted to hear the case, same as the judges here." He waved his The chair wasn’t large enough for both the doctor and the bulging pockets, so, can fully lifting his coat, he allowed the sides tv hang over the arms. Now, the frowsy- headed doll was looking furiously into the faces of the judges, while, on the “free and equal" side of the room, a pair of shapely legs pointed ceilingward, as was proper for that side of the house. The judge on the end seat had a kindly face. He turned in his swivel chair and ad- dressed the prisoner. “You are a physi- cian?" It was hardly a question. " Yes. sir." “Children’s specialist?” The judge was trying not to laugh—his eyes rested on the frowsy head that poked from the doctor's pocket. “Ha, ha!" It was a warm and hearty chuckle. It came from the prisoner, who went on: “I know how you got that.” He reached to his jxxket and pulled out the dilapidated doll. "One of my patients. Judge." He began to look it over. His smile was serious. “ Pretty disreputable character—one eye gone, teeth all knocked out, one arm off, and a smashed foot—Ha!—I don’t suppose even you get them as disreputable as this. Be- longs to a little patient of mine, over on the East Side, a little cripple; been in bed a year; wants me to make this well, same as 1 am going to make him well. That’s what In says.” He shook his head, closing his lips hand, to take them in. A twitter rippled through the court room. "Take the witness chair. Doctor, and we will endeavor to enlighten you," said the assistant district attorney, very politely. He laid down his papers, and was rubbing his hands together; his expression said —"I won't do a thing to you. oh. no!" The doctor rose and went over to the wit- ness chair on the platform beside the judges. " it’s funny about dolls and kids, i've PICKED UP AN OLD STOCKING FROM THE FLOOR. TIED \ KNOT IN IT FOR A HEAD, 4NI) PI T IT IN THEIR ARMS." tight in thought. Finally his face opened out in a broad smile from which an amused chuckle just oozed. It was a remarkable face—it held one almost anticipating what he might say. "Its name is ‘ Da'—looks it, doesn't it?” He was turning it around, inspecting it closely. "Both began well, the name andThe Children's Specialist	4’i the doll, but kind of petered out, 1 suppose.*' His big body overflowed the chair, and the bulge from the inside poekct troubled him. Reaching in, he pulled out a quart bottle it bore no label. He held it up .vhile “Da rested in his lap. " Medicine. Judge." Then his face opened into a new kind of -mile, with a little embarrassment in it. '• l.ooks as if 1 might be a veterinary, with a drench for a horse.' The judge inter- rupted—almost apolo- getically —with a smile. “This is hardly rele- vant. Doctor. \ ou are charged with exceed- ing the speed limit." “ Relevant. Judge?" his face was wide open, astonished. “Why, the soup was getting cold, Judge."- He placed the bottle to his cheek, then shifted it to the other cheek t*• make sure. “It is cold.” His face sud- denly changed; all the astonishment left it for a troubled look. His eyes lifted to the judge's. ‘‘It's the best medicine in the world for a little weazened lace in pain, if it's hot. Judge.” Turning, he held it out to the assistant district attorney and said: “Just hand it to that cop behind you and tell him to put it on the radiator by the gate. I'll get it when I go out.” They pamed it quickly down the line like a ball at a football game. Seeing “Da" in his lap, the doctor picked it up and looked it over. “Speed? Of coursc 1 speeded; he needed the medicine. And, besides, he was waiting for ’ 1 >«.'" He looked up to find the judges watching him. so he went on. " It's funny. Judge, about dolls and kids.” lie was now smiling confidentially into the judge’s face. “1 have been studying them lor a long time. Why, Judge, I’ve seen a lit tie kid. a year or two old, suffering such pain a~ you and I—thank God! have never known. A doll? Why, Judge, I’ve picked up an old stocking from the floor, tied :i knot in it fora head, and put it in their arms. They stop crying, nestle up to it. and some- times tell it not to cry.” His eyes were half-closed, his face soft and tender. He was almost whispering now. “Why. Judge, it seems to remind them ol something they’re so full of love that - well. Judge, they never learn of love in the corner of an attic, where the roof leak- and the windows are stuffed with old new spapers. and it‘> either stilling hot or beast I \ cold.” He paused a moment, as though he saw it all again. Some one on the " free and equal " side of the room was smothering a laugh; it was a woman with her head on the bench before her; her shoulders were heaving. It was an unpleasant, strident laugh. “No, sir, they don’t learn it there; they bring it with them, Judge, from where they come.” A fearless smile overspread his face. “And I’m never sorry to see their little visit here made short; I'm never sorry to see them in their little boat bound for the place from whence they came, and even old ‘Da’ here isn't too bad to keep them company. And 1 always try, no matter how disreputable, to tuck these 'Da's' in their little skiffs before they are carried out." He looked at the kind-faced judge earnestly. “ Y ou don't see this side. Judge; you only see the side that makes you angry. I see it. too, and it makes me mad, madder than hell sometimes; but then I throw that off. for I’m only a ‘children’s specialist. ’ ” He was again smiling, and so was every- body else in the room; but theirs was a nervous smile, almost apprehensive. He glanced at the clock that faced him on the opposite wall. "My Lord, look at the time! Quarter past twelve, and 1 said I would be back with ‘Da’ all fixed at half past. I've got to hustle.” He chuckled to himself as he stuffed “Da" in his pocket. “But I'm al-Everybody’s Magazine ways I hi.' way—get talking about kids and never know when to stop.” As he rose from his seat, the chair stuck to hint—he pushed it down and chuckled again. “I’m so used to sitting on boxes that 1 hardly know how to conduct myself in a parlor.’’ He stepped down from the little platform of the witness chair like an elephant in a circus. From the radiator, as he passed, he took- the bottle of chicken soup and stuffed it back into his pocket. As he went through the little gate, one of the legs in his pocket kicked defiantly at the judges, while the other kept waving a "day-day,” all the way down the aisle, to the “free and equal,” who still were smiling as if hypnotized. His hand was on the knob of the door when he stopped abruptly: then turned back. He was not smiling, but blushing. ••Judge," he said, with chagrined aston- ishment, “we forgot the trial.” He re- minded the "free and equal” of their boy when caught in the act. The judges said nothing. They stared at the children's spe- cialist. but what they saw was much farther away. ••Well. Judge, what’s it going to be for ‘Da’ and me?" He had pulled “Da" out of his pocket and put it back very carefully. “We're sorry, especially ’Da'—if that's going to do any good." It was a serious smile that now played about his very un- usual face—a mixture of sunshine and shadow. One oi the judges was wiping his glasses very slowly, as if he expected to be busy at it for an hour. Another was picking up some papers from the floor behind the bench and having trouble with the last sheet. The kindly-faced one looked very severe; seeing his colleagues were silent, he spoke sternly: “Justice must be done at any cost.” The audience, to a man, frowned. “ Put the officer back on the stand,” went on the judge. “I want to ask him some ques- tions.” The impatient clerk suddenly appeared from behind his desk, looking angry, and hissed: “Donnelly!” And as Donnelly passed him he coughed, and said, from force of habit: "Take it out.” But Donnelly only shook his head and looked bewildered. “Officer”—it was the judge in the middle who spoke, his elbows on the desk “did you measure the distance?” “No, ma'am.” “Don’t call me ‘ma’am!’” It shot out like a blast. The cop shrank back. “Stand up straight, don’t slouch that way. Now what have you got to say?” “Nothing, ma’am—sir.” “ Discharged for want of evidence.” The other two judges nodded their assent. “And see here, Doctor, you and ‘Da’ keep out of this court.” Turning to the bicycle cops who filled the room from their Sunday drag-net. His Honor said: “The first officer that leads that man here again I'll fine for contempt of court.”STRAIGHT TALK ONCE MORE—WOMAN S SPHERE ' My dkar Mk Hard: Permit me to say that your articles upon “The Woman of rhe Future," to my mind, arc the most illuminating and suggestive that have yet appeared anywhere.

The sloughs of corruption that have been un- covered could never have existed at all in the face of woman’s stern disapproval of the known guilty ones, l or they have been known well enough.

It is entirely possible that it may be such, or an important factor in ii: but even if that bo so. il will be long years before these institutions can become available for woman in the mass; and long, long before that, can come to pass, a Herculean labor will have to be done to create a social atmosphere of approval and appreciation for a sphere exclu- sively woman's From my view point, woman can never come into her own till she realizes two fundamental facts: First that.she is a woman for the single purpose of bearing children, and that every detail in her life depends upon, and is secondary to, that function: and. second—that she is solely responsible for the bent of her child's and hence of the rice’s fundamental moral character.

He was a popular “society” doctor, whose bread and butter it was to entourage every imagined illness and. by suggestion, to magnify them to the limit of her own or her mother's credulity. Do you know, deprived of that sort of practice, half the city profession would be out of business and the other half would barely live. W. B. K. Ainsworth, Xeb. A NAVY SURGEON ON SNAKE-BITF.S I have just read Samuel Hopkins Adams’s “The Poison Bugaboo" in your October maga- zine. The purpose of this letter is to take square issue with the statement that only eighty persons have ever died of snake-bite in the United States. Within thc last five years I myself, at my own expense, have collected evi- dences of twenty cases, none older than fifteen years, which are. so 1 am assured by com- petent authority, as well established as is re- quired by current rules of court practice. 1 recognize the fallacies that beset any one who investigates so difficult a subject; still. I am con- vinced that the majority of the errors in con- nection with snake-bitesarises through inexact- ness in determining the species of the snake. For instance, I have been unable to find the report of more than one fatal case of rattlesnake bite in Mississippi, although I have records of numerous cases where the persons bitten re- covered. I ascribe this to the fact that the only rattlesnake that is at all generally known there is thc Crohilus horridus; this species at- tains perhaps its maximum development in this state; wherefore I conclude.and 1 have so always maintained, that thc Crotalus horridus is not essentially deadly, by which 1 mean that under ordinary circumstances it is not apt to kill a grown-up human being. In mountainous re- gions, however, this species is occasionally more deadly than the loregoing statement would indicate. It is, as the French say. “quite another pair of sleeves" as regards the Crotalus odomantcus, the diamond-backed rattlesnake of thc south- eastern United States. I agree fully with thc statement in Professor Ditmars’s “Reptile Book ” which classes this serpent as the peer of any venomous snake whatsoever. I n conclusion, I beg leave to suggest that more judicious investigation of records easily avail- able w ill amplify greatly the estimates to w hich I have referred. Through careful consideration of data a\railable to me I estimate, and I do not hesitate to predict, that the next census will show that deaths from snake bites are about as common in thc southeastern states as arc those from lightning. And, inasmuch as antitoxin treatment of snakc-bites is easily available, it follows that deaths from snakc-bites should he classed as preventable. W. F. Arnold, M. D., Surgeon. U. S. Navy, Retired. NEVER DUG POST HOLES IN PEACE RIVER VALLEY 1 see in your February issue a story by Robert I )unn, and in that article he has me digging telegraph post holes in thc Peace River Valley. Now, sir, 1 have not dug post holes in Peace River, nor have 1 ever been in that part of Can- ada. I have been in Yukon and Dawson City off and on for these last fourteen years, orsincc early in 1897, and only came out to Victoria. B.

You may imagine how this article hasaffccted me. being, as it is, a ridicule of a whole republic. This article gives an entirely erroneous idea of w hat Ecuador and its people arc, presenting us as uncivilized people of the media-val age. I cannot understand how Everybody s M agazine lias permitted such an article to be published. It appears to me that you Amer- icans, as well as wc Latins, should do everythin*; to further pleasant relations between the two Americas instead of dividing, and creating anStraight Talk 4-’5 anti-American spirit in the South, with articles lacking so much in prudence and veracity as this. I trust that as a courtesy to my country, where there are men as civilized and manly as in any other country in the world, you will kindly publish this protest against the gratuitous offender.	Dk. j. Cceva Garcia. Colon, R. P. THE RAILROADS' TROUBLES—AND OURS Just now, the railways are clamoring for a vast increase in rates of freight, as being neces- sary to their continued existence, and putting up the plea that it is impossible to effect further economies. It would therefore seem to be a not unfitting time to inquire somewhat into the facts in the case and to learn why it is that so many predatory’ corporations are permitted to prey upon them and divert into other hands the revenues which should accrue to them. Of course, the express companies come first <>n the list. These vampires, preying alike upon the railways and the public, are merely a set of impudent interlopers, third parties, thrust in between the carrier and the public, with no ex- cuse for existence except to wring from the peo- ple extortionate profits, at the partial expense of the railways. The express companies get anything they want from the carrying corpora- tions—space in their stations, yards, advertise- ments, time of their employees, car and train accommodations, etc., apparently without let or hindrance; and all to conduct a business which should rightfully be carried on by the carriers themselves. It is just as easy to handle an express as a freight business. Next in order might lie mentioned the Pull- man Company. The enormous profits of this parasite should accrue to the railways. What reason is there to prevent them from caring for and forwarding the sleeping passenger? As a matter of fact, the ll.i" O. R. R. Co. did, at one time, handle its own sleeping cars, but was handicapped because it could not forward them beyond its own lines. Cooperation by the railways would enable them to transport the passenger across the continent in a parlor or palace car as easily as in a day coach. Can it lie that the interests of railway officials prevent? Again, there arc the “fast freight" lines and the "car trusts" ami the different bridgesowned by outsiders, which exact a heavy toll from the railways. There is a bridge used by the P., Ft. W. & C. R. R. at Pittsburg which. 1 am in- formed. is owned by a separate corporation that collects toll for every ton of freight and every passenger coach that passes over its bridge. Why should not the railway own it? Again, there are the numerous and costly private cars used by “officials." How many of these arc necessary? In how many cases would the public be better served if these persons traveled as do those who pov, instead of placing those who are paid in .1 different < Ias> In how many cases would the "official" know 1 lie needs of the road and the public better, it he traveled as does the ordinary passenger? The truth is. the railway “officials" have set themselves apart as a separate and superior order of beings and wrapped themselves in an insufferable and abounding conceit; when the truth, as shown by investigation, has proved them guilty of every kind of commercial and business iniquity, by which they have fostered the trusts, broken down legitimate competition. bril>ed legislators and councils, and loaded their roads with ficti- tious capital and bond issues. While 1 am writing, permit me to say that 1 believe credit to be due the magazines for the recent, and the coming, political revolutions. The crimes of the Republican party have l»een many, but the newspapers would never have exposed them. We can learn the truth through the non-partisan magazines only. D. W. H. Ben Avon, Pa. PREACHING A MAGAZINE ARTICLE Permit me to congratulate you on the superb discussion on the subject of mirat les contributed to your January number by William Hanna Thomson. Doctor Thomson's argument gripped me so that I gave it to my people on the first Sunday in January, and related the circum- stance of how my attention was called to it in the columns of your magazine, and how his argument gripped me, and warmed me up, and filled me up, until it was a sheer impossibility for nie to do otherwise than to give it red-hot to my Sunday morning congregation. It has in- vigorated my faith and, through my Sunday morning message, the faith of my people, in the supernatural elements of the Christian faith. I do not hesitate to pronounce it the most lucid, cogent, convincing argument for miracles that I have ever heard or read, and I have more than a hundred volumes of sermons on my library shelves.	J. L. Merrill. Wis. ENDORSING MR. WILDER S VIEWS There could be no better example to illustrate Mr. Wilder's position in support of delegated government than the letters which oppose it. His moderation, far sight, long logic, and clear thought are thrown into high relief by the heated arguments and local interests of his opponents. Until the laws are administered by trained and specialized minds, and the truly unedu- cated masses (uneducated, in that they have- not learned to respect learning) are represented by their superiors, we shall continue to play the child in the parliaments of the world.

She will only add to the game the delightful fillip of an altered emphasis. Lmily James Putnam's charming studies of significant phases in the historical development of sheltered Furojican womanhood, "The l.ady" (Sturgis and Walton), besides being examples of a genuinely constructive scholar ship and expressions of a distinct literary per- sonality. illustrate the titillating possibilities ol the new approach to the old mystery. The author comes gracefully and graciously for- ward, offering to call a truce in the age-long conflict oi deception, and ready to meet us 'vizor down and only the sharp poniard of ,i tempered irony b\ way of side-arms) on thc middle ground of unbiased inquiry. She proudly foregoes all sex-allowances and tacitly disclaims all benefits 011 hivalrous make-believe. She is impersonal, un-sellVonscious. frank, per- spicacious. sincere. She delicately, yet un- flinchingly. draws aside veil after veil; analyz 4-b ing the successive protective devices of fem- ininity with deft feminine self-knowledge. But when, with a little bow and a mocking smile, she leaves us at last—while she leaves us vastly edified and no little instructed, we findourselvt, no whit disillusioned and no jot less mystified. There is a blunt vet tactful justice, a delicate recognition of humble but genuine scrvicc. in the French idiom that speaks of the interested and sympathetic lookers-on at a function as "assisting" at the event. I should like, for a moment, to borrow the expression. For the publication of "The Japanese Letters of Lafca- dio Ilearn" (Houghton. MitBin), edited by Elizabeth I’.i-land. offers us the none too fre- quent privilege of assisting, in this sense, at the induction of a neophyte into the body of Lnj: lish literature. Many an honest eyebrow will perhaps raise itself in doubting challenge of this statement; because, in the first place, it has I icon insisted upon to the point of triteness that the "art of letter writing" has been lost to us moderns: and. in the next place, because we ha\'c come, by the hard and fast habit of our aesthetic outlook, feel that an intention of !>crmancnce is of the essence of art ; that ‘art " in letter writing leads to artificiality; and hence that letters and literature are incompatible terms. Here, however (as has happened just often enough before to prove the relative elas- ticity of the rule), a retiring, sensitive, yet vital personality has found its most adequate self- expression in the exercise of an untrammclcd and exquisite spontaneity in correspondence. Hearn’s most tangible service to mankind has been his offering of himself as a neutral groundA Row of Books for the meeting of the occidental and oriental consciousnesses. But he possessed to so extraor- dinary a degree the artist's ability to put him- self, intellectually and emotionally, in others' places, that he spent his life looking at the world through alien eyes, and never, for all bis ho|KS and strivings, reached the self-assertion of creative art. Indeed, his mind, instead of being the sculptor's studio of his artistic labors, was in reality the statue upon which he worked. And it is only in his letters that wc find its beauties of contour and quality preserved and revealed. It is well, however, to remember that, letters Iteing fragmentary glimpses, not parts of a com- pleted whole, a volume of them is a book to browse in. not to consume seriatim or at a sit ting. \Yc are so accustomed to table d'hite literature that we have lost the habit of reading ii	la earle. Nevertheless, the present volume, the third of Hearn's collected correspondence, is for the most part made up of letters to Basil Hall Chamberlain, written between 1S90 and 1894; ami the community of understanding and sympathy in their respective altitudes toward Japanese life and tradition, which is the under- lying factor in the inspiration oi the letters, adds to the unity and homogeneity of the series. £3 Mr. James Lane Allen is reported to have said that he feared he had delivered too soon the message that bis “Bride of the Mistletoe" was intended to convey. Mr. Allen, being more completely acquainted with the message than his readers, is better qualified to judge: yet the second story oi the projected trilogy of com- munication, “The Doctor’s Christmas Eve" (Macmillan), sufficiently amplifies the infer- ences of the first tale to suggest the possibility that the message comes too late rather than too early—that it is a message which the conscious- ness of the day has already accepted, the disap- pointments of which it has already discounted, and the hopeful possibilities of which it is already busily, though blunderingly, trying to work out. "The Bride of the Mistletoe" pictured for us the sudden collapse, in a Kentucky household, of the desperately maintained fiction that ro- mantic love is self-endowed with unchanging youth; and. in the pompous scholasticism of Professor Ousley’s didactic essay.offered us,over Mrs. Ousley's shoulder, some post-Darwinian proofs of the inevitability of the catastrophe. The new story pictures for us the breakdown of an equally desperately maintained fiction—the notion that faithfulness to an unconsummated romance condones the sin of its own selfishness and illusions. Mr. Allen’s earnestness and con- viction in the writing of these tales are unmis- takable and almost sacerdotal. And the accusa- tions oi " bewildered pessimism " that have been brought against him are quite naturally incom- prehensible to him except on the .supposition that his proclamation has been premature. In reality, however. Ins solemn announcement of the hopeless breakdown of .1 discredited Sexual idealism cannot but appear bewildered and pessimistically futile to an age that is already sorting out the foundation stonesol a new and, as it fondly hopes, a more practical ideal. & Did you ever talk to a man who was a born collector and who. through long indulgence in the habit, had become a confirmed and hopeless incurable? Are not these people, for the most part, and to put it bluntly, “the limit"? And yet is there not an oddly irritating fascination in the perversions and inversions that their vocab- ularies and their sense of values have undergone? Mr. E. V. Lucas, the indefatigable anthologist, is one of the rare instances of a congenital col- lector who, while indulging his master passion, has remained human and articulate. That is to say. while he does not invariably retain any sense of needed relationship between his treas- ured specimens and life, he has never lost his appreciation of the relationship between life and the beloved avocation of the collector. He can. and occasionally does, engagingly explain the modus operandi of the cult, and admit us as spectators in imagination to the activities of its initiates. In a story called “Over Bemerton's," he not only introduced us to an attractive victim oi this obsession, but actually induced us to share some of his hero's joy and solace in his literary treasure-trove. And in his latest book, ‘Mr. Ingleside” (Macmillan), he offers us the nilr(< to a select and genuinely likable coterie of desultory pokers-nbout among old books and old jjossessions; and, under cover of telling us a simple little story, gives us for an hour’s breathing the languorous but restful air of lit erary and arsthetic dilettanteism. & Mr. Arnold Bennett’s "How to Live on j.} Hours a Day" (Doran) is one of the most intrinsically amusing events of the moment. For it is admirably, although innocently, calcu- lated simultaneously to confound the extrem- ists of both parties to the Bennett controversy: those who have hailed this young Englishman as impeccable, and those who have declared him to Ite impossible. Mr. Bennett's really remark- able grasp of the subjective mentality of his characters, joined to the complete detachment and the aloofness from sentiment of his attitude as an author, has induced the intellectuals and the emotionais to regard him, respectively, as superhuman and as inhuman. The intense per-smial ca mot nes» oi I Iii> didactic little essay, in which lie tills us how to hccome capitalists of 1‘imc by saving half hours, and intellectual Sandows by doing mental calisthenics, may conceivably induce the emotionalists to hail him as a Daniel come to judgment and the intel- lectuals i'> declare that he has become a Bro mide. As a matter of facl, it merely proves that. like other and less gifted mortals, Mr. Bennett is lovably and humanly capable of being pas- sionately banal out of business hours. & 1 would like to pul a small red cross opposite the name of (iouverneur Morris's new volume of short stories. "The Spread Eagle" (Scribner). This mark is not meant. like Baedeker's cele- brated star, to indicate that if you are travel- ing first class through current literature, with a courier and fourteen trunks, you must by all means put up at this book of entertainment. It is intended to serve as a reminder (like a knot in one's watch chain or a ring changed to an unaccustomed linger) that you do not want lo forget il. This is not only because there are moments when it will come in handy, liut be- cause there are moods that it will minister to. legitimate moods that it will supply with that i>f which they stand in need and which in these days is difficult to come upon—namely, a whole- hearted and unforced restatement of the worth of naive enthusiasms and of the validity oi youthful ideals. An ideal is a faith clothed in illusion. And we are so busy just now getting rid of worn-out illusions preparatory to being measured for new ones, that our faith in the simple joys of life occasionally finds itself un- clothed and shivering in the cold. Mr. Mur- ris's stories, with the unassumed sparkle and unadulterated zest that enliven and inspire his work, remind us that there is still warmth and wear left in some of the garments that we have incontinently relegated to the rag heap. 0 " X ightshade " (Brentano’s), by Paul Gwynne. is one of the fictional first-fruits of the scientific world's new attitude of open-minded inquiry toward the so-called uncanny. This attitude is, in itself, one of the most interesting and significant developments of our day. since it indicates modern science's emergence from adolescence into maturity. In its infancy sci- ence. like other infants, believed everything that was told il -that ducks wintered under water and that oysters grew on trees. Later, it instinctively realized that “there is an age in life when we must dare to lie unjust, when we must make a dean sweep of all admiration and respect got at second hand, and deny every- thing—truth and untruth everything which we have not ourselves known for truth.” The resulting scientific materialism, dogmatic ami militant, was a youth's declaration of intellect- ual independence. This turning, of its own accord, to the quiet consideration of that which it has long denied is the proof of its conscious freedom and achieved manhood. Incidentally, this new altitude (as Mr. Gwynne's weird novel shows) bids fair, for the first time in a generation or so. once more to allow grown-up children legitimately to satisfy the wholesome and nat- ural cravings of their imaginations with the delicious pseudo-terrors of grown-up ghost stories. The central theme of Mr. Gwynne's story is the [lower of supernormal vision given to the eyes of a blind musician by a lamp emitting ultra-violet rays of adjustable wave lengths, invented by a Mcphistophclian old scientist oi doubtful antecedents and questionable aims. The violinist himself, the Parisian gamin who attends him, and the two sisters whom he blindly thinks are one woman, make a back- ground of human interest for the hinted horrors of scientific disclosure. "Nightshade," in that it finally calls in the dead imaginings of the old superstition to "explain” its eventual denoue- ment. is a hybrid and transitional type. But it is so genuinely suggestive in the partial realiza- tion of its eerie conception, and so successfully revives an emotion long absent from current fiction, thal it would be ungrateful to empha- size its shortcomings at the expense of its attainments.

Ni-w Vokk I’m WITH "EVERYBODY'S” PUBLISHERS The completest information we can get would indicate that Mormon leaders continue to practice polygamy, continue to encourage the prac- tice among the younger men, continue to disregard their agreement with the Government of the United States, continue to flout the nation’s laws, continue to scour the world for women victims of tlu ir sublimated white slavery. When we arranged with ex-Senator Cannon for his "Under the Prophet ” series, our chief object was to give to our readers an accurate inside account of the growth and present status of Mormonism. An account as accurate as history should be. divested of all high coloring, imaginary plots, and subterranean mysteries. We believed we should be doing the Mormons a good turn to report their history thus honestly and accurately. We did not hate the Mormons. We did not fear the Mormons. We did not believe the stories of their present polygamous practices. We thought there might be two or three exceptions, at most. As the truth has been forced upon us that some of the leaders of the Church are openly living in polygamy, brazenly defying the laws, secretly encouraging the young men in polygamous practices, there has gradually grown up in us a great wrath at the attitude of these leaders, a great disgust at polygamy, and a great shame that Americans should permit it. When our art director, with rare genius, placed the illustrations in this month’s instalment, he visualized polygamy.

Once, before Utah was a state, the United States Government said: “You must stop polygamy!" And the Prophet straightway got in touch with the Almighty and secured a new revelation to cover the trying situation in which thc “chosen people” found themselves. And the leaders stopped polygamy until they had obtained statehood -but really carried the doctrine on as a cardinal principle of their faith. And now they return to the practice of it. And political parties, for the sake of votes, wink at the breaking of the laws and the disregard of pledges. Do the Mormons actually believe in their religion? Do the women actually believe they are serving God Almighty when they lend them- selves to this ghastly practice? It passes belief, and yet it must be so. However attractive divinely legalized license may be to the men, and however much the women may be influenced to choose half a home or one-fifth of a home to no home, the fact remains that Mormons are devout. We cannot but admire many Mormon traits—courage, frugality, tenacity; but their persistence in polygamy is an insult and a menace to the rest of the country and a crime against society. It has got to stop. If the government of Utah will not stop it; if the men will not stop it—then in mercy’s name let the women take hold and stop it. They can do it. 1 hey ought to do it. The real crime is against woman- hood. Why don't they stop it? Utah is a woman’s suffrage state. Why don’t the suffrage leaders ol the nation show, by cleaning up Utah, what women can do with the ballot?EVERYBODY'S MAGAZINE “All through the life of a feeble-bodied man his path is lined with memory’s grave- stones which mark the spot where noble enterprises per- ished for lack of physical vigor to embody them in deeds’ Horace Mann.

It is not that he has no watch— but because he is ashamed of the time lie is carrying. He has no confidence that it is anywhere near correct and he tries to save his dignity by not making a comparison. What do you think of the type of man who will carry a cheap and un- certain timepiece because it doesn't have to be seen ? It is quite different with the HOWARD owner. He is ready to match time with all comers. The HOWARD is the closest rating watch in the world—and worth all it costs to any man of accurate habit and orderly mind.

MASS., widely known as the scat of Harvard College, is a progressive modern city of 100,000 inhabitants. For some years the superintendent of streets has been experimenting with Tarvia as a macadam road binder and dust layer. To-day, tarviated macadam has been adopted as a standard method of con- struction. Harvard Street, leading to the college, and one of the principal automobile routes from Boston, was in bad condition in iryoS. A section of the Harvard Square end was laid with Tarvia X, and an adjacent section was built without Tarvia. The experience during the succeeding winter convinced the superintendent that Tarvia was necessary to make a macadam road endnre modern fast-moving traffic. The next season sections of Columbia Street, also an automobile route. Berk- shire and York Streets were built , follow- ing the methods used on Harvard St. At the same time Massachusetts Ave., one of the heavy travelled streets leading from Boston to the suburbs on the northwest, was rebuilt in a thoroughly substantial manner with Tan ia X. In addition to the construction work, Tarvia B has been spread on automobile thoroughfares like Magazine Street, Kirkland Street and the Charles River Parkway. On these streets the automobile traffic is extremely heavy, as Cambridge is not only the way out from Boston to the north and west, but is also crossed by all traffic from the southern to the northern suburbs. Tarvia B was chosen after actual road trials of different types of dust layers and road preservatives. Booklet regard ini’ the Tarvia treatment free on request to our nearest office.

Look out for that when you buy your roofing. Ordinary so-called asphalt roofings arc made of artificial pro- ducts masquerading as real asphalt. They are nothing more than the residue from petroleum oil or native bitumens made into a black pitch, which is easily affected by changes in weather. Genasco the Trinidad-Lake-Asphalt Roofing is made of genuine natural asphalt—perfectly stable ami uniform in quality. Trinidad Lake Asphalt is endowed by Nature with natural oils; and they stay in it. This gives < icnasco its wonderful resistance to rain, snow, sun. wind, heat, and cold—anti keens it lastingly waterproof. The artificial asphalts have oils tnixiil with them, but they haven't the quality of the oils in the natural product; and they soon evaporate and leave the roofing “dead"—and it cracks, breaks ami leaks, although at the first it may look like Genasco, the real Trinidad-Lake-Asphalt roofing. Natural asphalt in roofing is the greatest weather-resister known. To make sure of roofing that will permanently protect, ask your dealer for tienasco, the Trinidad-Lake-Asphalt Roofing, with either mineral or smooth surface. Fully guaranteed. The Kant-leak Kleet waterpr- -is the son ms if Genasco Roofing without cement, does away with najl-leaks, and gives the roof an attractive finish.

Nor will it set fire to boards underneath. This has been proven by impartial tests made by Fire Chiefs and City Council representatives of many large cities. J-M Asbestos Roofing is absolutely fire-proof because its base consists of several layers of pure Asbestos Felt. And Asbestos, you know, is the fire-proof, practically indestructible, mineral used in gas grates, stove mats, theatre curtains, etc. These lavers of Asbestos (stone) Felt are firmly cemented together with genuine Trini- dad Lake Asphalt—that wonderful mineral cement which, in asphalt pavements, stands the '* giinding of wheels and pounding t>f hoofs for thirty to forty years. Thus. J-M Asbestos Roofing is composed of all minerals. Not a particle of perishable J material in J-M Asbestos Roofing Because of this mineral or stone construc- tion. J-M Asbestos Rooting is also rust-proof, rot-proof and acid-proof. And. like all stone, it never needs painting or coating. No other ready roofing gives a building such absolute fire protection. None other lasts so long with so little attention. J-M Roofing is still in good condition on many buildings after nearly a quarter of a century of service.

The fact that it won more of the important racing events of 1910 is gratifying, of course, and the fact that it established more new racing records than any other car is pleasing. But these things are incidental. Our primary purpose is to build the best motor cat in the world for family purposes. Our purpose in racing has been to discover and correct weaknesses in the car that no other test could search out. The Marmon has won the lion's share of the big races and captured the lion’s share of the records simply because its design and construction are such as to successfully withstand the terrific strains of high speed for hundreds of miles without let-up and because it is the easi- est-riding car in the world -easy on its driver, easy on its tires and easy on its own mechanism.

They worked on the first car built in Detroit; experimented through all the years of development; manufactured by the tens of thousands during the great demand for usable cheap cars. Their names are famous wherever cars are known. Two years ago. a demand for better qual- ity appeared. It began to be apparent that cheap, machine-made cars, hastily assem- bled. could not be permanently satisfactory. Buyers began asking for the quality found in costly cars. The great manufacturing interests owned by these men were quickly sold. A new factory was purchased; a million dollars and a year's time spent in its equipment. Then came the sifting and final adoption of designs, parts and equipment—a process of infinite care. Built For a New Demand For it was determined to build a genuine "quality car"—to set a standard for years. To eliminate every useless part, profit by the matchless experience available, manu- facture every detail, and give to those operations which make for excellence, a de- gree of painstaking care known only to the costliest. The result was the "Everitt 3v.*’ This was the car built to meet the new demand. As it appeared on the road, a year ago. it attracted instant attention. Engi- neers who examined it. pronounced It a marvel of scientific and simplified mechan- ism. Buyers who drove it. found it gave a satisfaction and remarkable performance hitherto unknown to medium-priced cars. The new model was an instant success. Then the production began. Slowly, for quality was the object—not quantity. It was from the start impossible to supply the demand for a car like this. But altogether, in that year. 900 “Everitts" were placed in owners’ hands. From these first cars have come astonish- ing stories of service. Owner after owner has written to the factory in remarkable words. There has not been a single “come- back”; not a single dissatisfied owner. Every one of the 900 has made good. Limited Quality—Every Car Right It was determined at the start to limit factory production—realized as the ono means of maintaining quality. This for the reason that the processes which mean most to a high-grade Car are necessarily slow and tedious. It is Impos- sible to hurry the skilled handwork of adjusting, assembling, inspecting and test- ing, without sacrificing quality. This in addition to the mechanical operations com- mon to all modern factories. Good cars are always built slowly. And this is why there will be only 4,000 Everitts this year from a factory of double that capacity. It means that many would-bo buyers will be disappointed; but it also means that every man who gets an Everitt will get a car he knows is right. The price —51,400—is an incident. It is the quality that counts. We want you to see this car—to test it for yourself over the worst conditions you can find. Only in this way can it really be appreciated.

These pat- ented tires now cost nothing extra. Our multiplied output—$8,500,000 last year —has cut the cost of production. No Rim-Cutting Half of the saving comes in avoidance of rim- cutting. The two pictures above show you how this is done. Both tires are shown fitted in the same rim—the standard rim used for quick-de- tachable tires. Also for demountable rims. The left picture shows how the removable Tim flanges are set to curve outward with No-Rim-Cut tires. The tire comes against a rounded edge, and rim-cutting is made impossible. We have sold half a million No-Rim-Cut tires. We have run them flat in a hundred tests—as far as 20 miles. In all this experience there has never been an instance of rim-cutting. The picture at right shows how ordinary tires— clincher tires—are fitted to this same standard rim. The movable rim flanges must be set to curve inward—to grasp hold of the hook in the tire. That ishow the tires are held on. Note how the hook of the flange then digs into the tire. That is what causes rim-cutting. A punctured tire may be ruined beyond repair by running a single block. Hooks arc not needed with Goodyear No-Rim- Cut tires. Not even tire bolts are needed. Ttie tire stays on because 12(> braided wires are vulcan- ized into the base. They make the tire base un- stretch able, so nothing can ever force it over the flange. When the tire is inflated the braided wires con- tract. The tire is then held to the rim by a pres- sure of 134 pounds to the inch. This braided wire feature—which we control— forms the only practical way to make a booklet tire. A hard rubber base won't do—a single wire won’t do. The braided wires which contract under air pressure are essential to safety. 10% Oversize Good^ No-Rim-Cut Tires With or Without Non-Skid Tread Goodyear No-Rim-Cut tires are made 10 per cent wider than rated size. That means 10 per cent more tire—more carrying capacity—without any extra cost. That adds on the average 2S per cent to the tire mileage—saves 25 per cent of tire cost. Tires aro overloaded nine cases in ten. The tire size is not sufficient to take care of the extras —the top, glass front, gas tank, extra tire,ctc. The result is a blow-out long be- fore the tire is worn out. This extra size, which we give you free, takes care ol the extra weight. You get all these advantages without extra cost when you specify Goodyear No-Rim-Cut tire?. Our Tire Book is mailed t'ee. YEAR THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY.

P.. $1750 The Valveless Elmore Has the Only Motor Whose Cylinders Work With One United Impulse The Elmore Valveless High Duty Motor is one power unit having four related cylinders. Every other gasoline motor consists of indi- vidual cylinders, which are separate power units. The ordinary motor must have valves; those valves must have small parts (rods, cams, levers, springs, screws, etc.) to operate them, averaging twenty to the cylinder. Just as a chain's strength is defined by its weakest link, so is the efficiency of a valved cylinder measured by its most insignificant small part. Ii	a valve is not adjusted to the 1-200 of a second, its cylinder loses one-fifth, or more, of its power. The four cylinders of the Valveless Elmore are always delivering their full, normal power. A valved motor can only deliver, at each revo- lution of its crank shaft, one-halt as many power strokes as it has cylinders. The Valveless Elmore has a full power stroke from each cylinder at every revolution of its crank shaft. Having twice the jwwer strokes of a valved motor of the same number of cylinders, the Valveless Elmore has no equal for-continuity of power and sustained torque. The four Elmore cylinders furnish as many power strokes j>er revolution —or per mile—as could be delivered by an eight-cylinder valved motor. An eight-cylinder valved motor does not and is not likely to exist; perfect adjustment of the enormous number of small outer parts required would be vir- tually impossible. The Valveless Elmore, having the same num- ber of power strokes that an eight-cylinder valved motor would give, remains the sim- plest and most efficient power maker ever placed in an automobile. Valueless 2-Cycle There is only one conclusion; you must judge every oilier car and its motor by the efficiency of the Elmore. Write for our ign literature today. Roadster Model 25. 30 II.

From first to last, the agency nay costs you extra money. * When you want to find out about a policy for any purpose— to protect the family, educate the young folks, for endowment, (or business use — the rational way is to deal direct with the POSTAL LIFE. You thus escape commissions, ’.ranch-office expense, collection fees, etc., and get full official infor- mation which is in black and while ind binding on the Company. * The POSTAL I.IFE-INSUR- \XCK COMPANY is the only non-agency Company in America —the only Company that wholly eliminates agency - expense: the result is genuine conservation in life-insurance. The saving is decisive and permanent, making the net cost •>f your insurance in the POS- TAL LIFE lower than ill any other company. « It is always good business to cut out the middleman when you can, but you can't always do it. In arranging a POSTAL Pol- icy. you fan cul bim out and save money for yourself just as hun- dreds have done and are doing in constantly increasing numbers, w The POSTAL LIFE is even now a large Company with in- surance in force as stated: it has policyholders in every State of the Union and in Canada, includ- ing Americans residing in foreign countries. And these policyholders arc its friends: they are satisfied and always speak good words for the Company when occa- sion serves. Why not write to the POSTAL? It has ample capital and re- sources to meet every demand now and in the future; it issues all the standard forms of legal-reserve insurance, and all its policies are approved by the critical New York State Insurance Department. * Here are four features (and there arc others) that strongly commend the POSTAL LIFE to those who have carefully looked into it: 1.	GUARANTEED DIVIDENDS: 912% paid to policyholder* annually from saving* be- cauie of the elimination of agency-expense. 2.	CONTINGENT DIVIDENDS: Made up and paid annually from other source*, the*e dividend* being in addition to the guaranteed dividend* and larger than other com- panies pay. 3.	LIBERAL OPTIONS AND VAL- UES: Enabling you, among other things, to add to the face-value of your Policy • larger amount of paid-up insurance than is posaible in any other company. 4.	OPTIONAL PREMIUM PRIVI- LEGE: You may deposit pre- miums monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually a* desired and without consult- ing the Company. In your teller be sure'lo slate: 1.	) 'our Occupa- tion. 2.	The exact date of your birth. It will pay you to find out what the Company will do for you personally.

It is not only the most widely known of all in- surance companies, but its reputation for fair dealing is as high as its fame is wide. Its popularity is but the result of its hun- dred years of splendid service to the insured. No loss has ever been too great for the Hartford’s strength; none too small to receive prompt attention. When you need fire insurance, tell your agent or broker to get you a policy in the Hartford. Sometimes you will be asked to accept a policy in a company which the agent says is "just as good as the Hartford.” But not knowing about this “substitute” what you know about the Hartford, why not get what you ask for ?

Only the very expensive im- ported goods can equal them. “I tell you that—dollar for dollar —there is nothing better produced anywhere than these perfect all-wool fabrics made in the Shackamaxon Mills in Philadelphia. “That identical pattern you are looking at—the same in every respect —would cost you twenty to thirty per cent more money if it was imported." Any tailor who handles Shackamaxon fabrics will tell yon the same thing. And he tells the exact truth. We use the finest grades of pure Aus- tralian and domestic wools; perfectly woven; perfectly shrunken: perfectly dyed and fin- ished. And we sell Shackamaxons direct to the tailor—not through a jobber. That is one reason for their extremely moderate cost to you.

Here is an engineer of world wide fame, the inventor <>f the Maxim Gun Silencer, for years (lie designer of a prominent water-cooled car. He gives up water cooling and adopts the Franklin because it gives service that no water-cooled car can give. He says: “I tried out a Franklin for a year, put it through all sorts of stunts and was firmly convinced that air cooling was best. “During one of the hottest days in summer I drove it 150 miles. If it was ever going to get hot it was right then. Far from it. If performed as steady as a top and took one of the worst hills in the country, on high gear. “The Franklin air-cooled motor is quick in response to the throttle. The greatest efficiency is attained because the motor is uniformly warm. “Another thing—with the air-cooled automobile there is a reduction in the weight of the car. Light weight means a saving on tires. This is one of the strong points of air-cooled machines. “AH makers will some day come to the air-cooled way of thinking. There are the best of reasons for the change." Designers of water-cooled cars admit that water circulating systems give trouble. Radiators, no matter how well designed, are delicate things. With an air-cooled automobile the radiator, water pump and piping are eliminated. Two “sixes” and two “fours” make up the Franklin line. Prices range from $4500 for the luxurious six-cylinder, seven-passenger, forty-eight- horse-power Model II to $1950 for the ever popular four-cylinder Model G, the most favorably known small car bniIt. Write for (he booklet "Hiram Percy Maxim Air-Cooled Convert". It is an intensely interesting interview with Mr. Maxim, given out in his home city and reprinted from Hartford Daily Times, December 31, l'MO.

The City Toiler—the Workingman— The Clerk—The Office Man —all must look to the SOI L for the Opportunity to Break Clear from the Eight O'Clock Bell, the Tyranny of the Boss, and the Dimin- ishing Chance. This is a Subject that in- terests You, Personally, and I want to ask You a Personal * Question: How much better off are You than Last Year, or the Year before That? Perhaps Your Wages are a little higher, but haven't your Expenses more than kept pace with that In- crease? Aren’t you paying a little more for your Clothes and your Meals, and don’t you smoke more Expensive Cigars ami More "t tlnm than Formerly? If it isn't Cigars, it may be something else—some more Expensive Habit. A Man Begins To Go Down Hill at Forty, and the time may come when a Younger Man per- haps a Cheaper Man will till your Job. The Man-Who-Looks Ahead will prepare himself for that time by getting a Home. My advice to You, therefore, is to Get a Home while You are alih In <1<i so—and Begin Now. I would further advise you to Get a Home in the Gulf Coast Country of Texas where you can J-’row Three Big Crops a Year on the samp Soil. m * * I'lease send me your Book Independence on Ten Acres.

We have Three big railroad sys- tems—The Santa Fe—The Frisco—and the Southern Pacific tappingour holdings. The Santa Fe passes right directly through our Tract, and the others are close In .

One package he put up in tinfoil, in a box of line appearance, and labelled them two for a quarter. The balance of this same brand lie put up in a lain box, in crude fashion and tagged them at c. each. The two for a quarter cigars were big sellers. The live cent ones stayed in the case. The smoker was stung—is stung. When we originated the "direct from factory to you" plan in the cigar business, we secured the custom Send Your t -iga :.f t ot thousands of wise smokers who were glad to know that they bought upon a basis ot’ mutual good faith. Our ‘‘direct from factory to you " plan is a simple, common sense prop- osition, because when you buy from us you don't have to pay the one, two or three, and—sometimes—four mid- dlemen their profits, commissions and expenses. That s just why we can and do sell the same values at half the price that you now pay at retail. The best proof of this is that we have, for years, been doing exactly this thing for tens of thousands of the most critical smokers, who buy from us year in and vear out. Our SAFE INVESTMENT, either in a 5-inch Panetela or a 4 j^-incli Londres, at $4.00 per hundred, is a fair sample of our line. It has an Havana iiller and a Sumatra wrapper —not a full ten-cent value, although you have paid ten cents for cigars not so good—but a cigar that gives a S-cent smoker a double value, at 4 cents, and cuts the 10-cent smoker's cigar expenses in two. Try it, at our risk. Send $1.00 for a Sample of Twenty-five <25) OUR GUARANTEE All cigar* we (hip are guaranteed to please you, and if, for any cause, they do not. we will refund your full purchase price, in cash, or exchange cigars with you, charging nothing for those you may have smoked, if not satisfactory.

P., Seattle, Washington — “1 use Armour's Extract of Beef many ways to great advantage, but will cite only one. A little added to a glass of milk gives a flavor that is a pleasant change both for baby and his grand- motber." Order a jar of Armour’s Extract of Beef from your grocer. N'olice its richness and appetizing aroma. Then make your soup according to the cook book rule—all hut the stock. When your recipe says "add stock," get out your Armour's Extract <>f Beef and allow a tea- spoonful to every quart <>f liquid. You will have the most satisfactory soup you have ever served, with a delightful flavor that ordinary soups cannot boast. For Armour’s Extract of Beef is the richest, most concentrated soup stock any cook could wish. One jar costs little more than the materi- als necessary for a small supply of old-fash- ioned soup stock, and it goes twice as far. It saves fuel, time and trouble—no more stewing over the kitchen stove. Mrs. W. K. Hurley, Texas — "I tind that Armour's Extract of licef saves me lime, worry and expense. I have long depended upon it to help me out in my cooking and ioiild hardly keep house without it. I should advise every, housekeeper to send for that valuable little cook book, ‘ Popular Recipes,' and learn how il helps them economize." .■I falii/ mailed to Armour Ci'm/'.Tin, t In, ,w.

The cold air falls from the ice chamber and, as it gives up its frigidity, sweeps upward through the food compartment until over the ice again, where, as it becomes cooled and condensed, it falls and re- peats the process. The ice being melted in this one-sided fashion gives graphic proof of this air current.

Important, but this should not alone govern the selection of paint for your buildings. The area a gallon will cover, the cost of spreading, the beautiful appearance, the years of service and freedom from cracking ancl scaling should also be considered. By any and every standard there is no better and no more economical paint than that made fresh at the time of the painting with CARTER Strictly Pure White Lead "The Lead with the Spread" ind pure linseed oil. If you are thinking of using any other paint, ascertain what your local paint dealer will have to charge for it now. Then got prices on Carter White Lead and pure linseed oil. A painter can tell you just what proportions are best for your particular work, but for comparison take 100 pounds of lead to 5 gallons of oil, with some tinting color ami drier, which will make 8 gallons of the best paint in the world. You will find that Carter White Lead paint will cost less by the gallon—so there is not even an apparent saving in first cost to induce you to use any substitute for Carter White Lead, and while adulterated linseed oil costs less than the pure, you can't afford to take the risk for the three or four dollars you might save on the cost of painting your house. How to know good paint and how to have good paint at reasonable cost is told in our free book, "Ptiro Paint," Send for it before you decide about any paint- ing.

It gives the richest and most durable finish to all floors, interior woodwork and furniture, because it contains more of the hard (expensive) wax, which makes a pound of Old English go farther and decidedly outlast most other finishes.

Vet my customers have taken a quarter of a million—two hundred and liftv thousand of these cigars -without any advertising beyond one very simple announcement. They would not have done this unless they felt sure that there was not a lietter cigar in America at anything like the price. The Club Special is 4*4 inches long and is “fatter” than my Panatela, the larger burning sur- face thus giving it a somewhat fuller, richer flavor. The entire tiller of the Club Special cigar is real Havana grown in the best section of Cuba. The wrapper is imported from the Island of Sumatra. It is hand-rolled by expert men dgarmakers in my model fac- tory at Philadelphia, and sold direct—thereby saving the profits that two middlemen would add to its price. MY OFFER IS —I will, upon request, send fifty Shivers’ Club Special cigars to a reader of Everybody’s Magazine, express prepaid. He may smoke ten of these cigars and return the re- maining forty at my expense if he is not pleased with them; if he is pleased with them and keeps them, he agrees to remit the price, $2.50, within ten days.

SK your physician what will cure you of chronic rheumatism, gout, gravel, or Bright's disease. If he is honest and frank with you, he will answer, "Nothing will cure you without a CHANGE IN’ YOUK HAMITS OF LIFE”. Ask him if your habits as to drinking are important, and see if he doesn't answer. "Most important of all”. If he seems reluctant to tell you what to drink, say: “Doctor, if I got into the habit of taking a glass of Buffalo Lithia Springs Water three or four times a day, how would it affect my health?” Then listen carefully to his answer, and think it over. Remember, Buffalo Lithia Springs Water is not a medicine, it is a pure natural water. Drinking it is the habit that cures. Get an unquenchable thirst, drink it every hour, drink it to excess if you can. Ask your doctor what the effect will be. If you don't like to ask him this, write and ask its what eminent physicians have said about the effect of this "Buf- falo drinking habit” on people who had your trouble.

Take the simplest case — two groups,each with three subscribers. As separate groups there are pos- sible only six combinations—only six lines of communication. Unite these same two groups, and instead of only six, there will be fifteen lines of communication. No matter how the groups are located or how they are connected by exchanges, combination in- creases the usefulness of each tele- phone, it multiplies traffic, it expands trade. The increase is in accordance with the mathematical rule. If two groups of a thousand each are united, there will be a million more lines of communication. No one subscriber can use all of these increased possibilities, but each subscriber uses some of them. Many groups of telephone sub- scribers have been united in thc Bell System to increase the usefulness of each telephone, and meet the pub- lic demand for universal service.

Lawrence. M. D.. in HimpUn't Macazine. Please note the words “with „ soap.” Please note, too, that they are italicized in Dr. Lawrence’s article. Take a cold bath, before breakfast, by all means — if you are in good physical con- dition. But do not lose sight of the fact that it is not possi- ble for anyone to be physical- ly clean who does not take at least one warm bath, with soap, every day. Use Ivory Soap. It floats; and it is pure. These are the qualities that make Ivory Soap unequalled for use in the bath. Purity, in a bath soap, is of paramount importance. And a bath soap that floats is im- measurably more convenient than one which, when needed, is at the bottom of the bath- tub. .....It Floats Ivory Soap The ailvrrii-mKiK* m Evrryl—ly's Magazine arc indexed.
