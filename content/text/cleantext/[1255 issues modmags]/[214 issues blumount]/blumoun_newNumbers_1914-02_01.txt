Wilfrid Wilson GibsonRupert BrookeLascelles AbercrombieJohn Drinkwater BLOODYBUSH EDGE Wilfrid Wilson Gibson Bloodybush Edge is a remote spot on the border-line between Englandand Scotland, marked by a dumpy obelisk, on which is inscribed anold scale of tolls. A rough sandy road runs down across the darkmoors, into England on the one hand, and into Scotland on theother. It is a fine, starry night in early September. Daft Dick, afantastic figure, in appearance half-gamekeeper, half tramp {dressedas he is in cast-off clothes of country-gentlemen) swings up the roadfrom the Scottish side, singing." Now Iyiddisdale has ridden a raid;But I wat they better hae stayed at hame ;For Michael o' Winfield, he lies dead;And Jock o' the Side is prisoner ta'en."He stands for a moment, looking across the fells, which are very dark,in spite of the starry sky ; then flings himself down in the heather,with his back to the obelisk, and lights his pipe. Presently, he seesa dark figure, stumbling with uncertain steps across the boggy moor;and watches it keenly as it approaches, until it reaches the road, whenhe sees that it is a strange man, evidently a tramp.Tramp : A track, at last, thank God !Dick : Aye, there be whilesWhen beaten tracks are welcome.Tramp: Who the . . . Oh!I didn't count on having companyAgain in this world ; and when I heard a voiceI thought it must be another ghost. It's queerHearing a voice bleat when you haven't heardA mortal voice for ages. I've not changedA word with a soul since noon ; and when you spokeIt gave me quite a turn. A feather, Iyord !But it wouldn't take the shadow of a featherTo knock me over. I'm in such a stickle,Dead-beat, and fit to drop. To drop ! I've droppedA hundred times already, humpty-dumpty ! Why, I've been tumbling in and out black holes,Since sunset, on that god-forsaken moor,Half-crazed with fear of ... Ah, you've got a light:And I've been tramping all the livelong dayWith a pipeful of comfort in my waistcoat-pocket;And would have swopt the frizzling sun itself ;For a match to kindle it. Thanks, mate, that's better.And now, what was it you were saying, Old Cock,When I mistook you then for Hamlet's father ?Lord ! if you'd seen him at the " Elephant,"In queer, blue sheeny armour, you'ld have shivered." I am thy father's spirit," he says, like that,Down in his boots. But you were saying Dick : There are timesWhen beaten tracks are welcome.Tramp : True for you :And truer by a score of bumps, for me.My neck's been broken half-a-dozen times :My body's just an aching bag of bones.I'm one big bruise from top to toe, as thoughI'd played in the Cup final, as the ball.And mud, I'm mud to the eyes, and over, carryingHalf of the country that I've passed through on me.My best suit, too ! And I was always faddyAbout my clothes. My mother used to call meFinicky Fred. If she could see me now !I couldn't count the times that I've pitched headlongInto black bog.Dick : Aye, there are clarty bitsIn Foulmire Moss. But what set you stravaging Among the peat-hags at this time of night ?Unless you know the tracks by heart. . .Tramp : I knowThe Old Kent Road by heart.Dick : The Old Kent Road ?Tramp : London, S.E. You've heard of London, likely ?Dick : Aye ! aye ! I've heard. . .Tramp : Well, mate, I've walked from London.Dick : You've walked from London, here ?Tramp : Well, not to-day.It must be nigh three hundred mile, I reckon.Just five weeks, yesterday, since I set out:But, as you say, I've walked from London, here :Though where " here " is, the devil only knows!What is " here " called, if it has any nameBut Back o' Beyond, or World's End, eh ?Dick : You're sittingOn Bloodybush Edge this moment.Tramp : To think of that!Bloodybush Edge ! And that's what I have come to ;While all my friends, the men and women I know,Are strolling up and down the Old Kent Road,Chattering and laughing by the lighted stallsAnd the barrows of bananas and oranges;Or sitting snugly in bars ; while, here am I,On Bloodybush Edge, talking to Hamlet's father.Dick : My name's Dick Dodd.Tramp : Well, no offence, Old Cock !And Hamlet's father was a gentleman,A king of ghosts ; and Lord ! but he could groan. My name's ... Jack Smith : and Jack would give a sovereign,A sovereign down, if he could borrow it,And drinks all round, and here's to you, and you!Just to be sitting in The Seven Stars,And listening to the jabber, just to snuffA whiff of the smoke and spirit. Seven Stars !I'm lodging under stars enough to-night:Seven times seven hundred. . .Dick : Often I have triedTo count them, lying here upon my back:But they're too many for me. Just when you thinkYou've reckoned all between two sprigs of heather,One tumbles from its place, or else a hundredSpring out of nowhere. If you only stareHard at the darkest patch, for long enough,You'll see that it's all alive with little stars ;Aod there isn't any dark at all.Tramp: No dark!If you'd been tumbling into those black holes,You'ld not think overmuch of these same stars.I couldn't see my hand before me. Stars !Give me the lamps along the Old Kent Road:And I'm content to leave the stars to you.They're well enough ; but hung a trifle highFor walking with clean boots. Now a lamp or so . . .Dick : If it's so fine and brave, the Old Kent Road,How is it you came to leave it ?Tramp : I'd my reasons.&gt;Dick : Reasons ! Queer reasons surely to set you trapesing Over Foulmire in the dark : though I could travelThe fells from here to Cheviot, blindfold. Aye !And never come a cropper.Tramp : 'Twas my luck,My lovely luck, and naught to do with reasons â€”My gaudy luck, and the devilish dust and heat,And hell's own thirst that drove me ; and too snugA bed among the heather. Oversleeping,That's always played the mischief with me. OnceI slept till three in the morning, and . . .Dick : Till three ?You're an early bird, if you call that oversleeping.Folk hereabouts are mostly astir by three :But, city-folk, I thought. . .Tramp : I'm on the night-shift.I sleep by day, for the most part, like a cat.That's why, though dog-tired now, I couldn't sleepA wink though you paid me gold down.Dick : Night-shift, you !And what may your job be ? Cat's night-shift, likely,As well as day's sleep !Tramp : Now, look here, Old Cock,There's just one little thing that we could teach youDown London way. Why, even babes in LondonKnow better than to ask too many questions.You ask no questions, and you'll hear no lies,Is the first lesson that's hammered into them.No London gentleman asks questions. Lord !If you went " What's-your-job ? "-itig down our way.You'ld soon be smelling someone's fist, I reckon ; Or tripping over somebody in the darkUpon the stairs : and with a broken neck,Be left, still asking questions in your coffin,Till the worms had satisfied you. Not that IHave anything to hide, myself. I'm onlyAdvising you for your own good. But, Old Chap,We were talking of something else . . . that hell-hot rnad.I'd pegged along it through the blazing dustFrom Bellingham, till I could peg no more,My mouth was just a limekiln ; and each foot,One bleeding blister. A kipper on the grid,That s what I was 011 the road. And the heather lookedSo cool and cosy, I left the road for a bit;And coming 011 a patch of wet green moss,I took my boots off; and it was so championTo feel cold water squelching between my toes,I paddled on like a child, till I came to a clumpOf heather in full bloom, just reeking honey;And curled up in it, and dropt sound asleep ;And, when I wakened, it was dark, pitch-dark,For all your stars. The sky was light enough,Had I been travelling that way. But, for the road,I hadn't a notion of its whereabouts.A blessed babe-in-the-woods I was, clean lost;And fit to cry for my mammy. Babes-in-the-wood iBut there were two of them, for company,And only one of me, by my lone self.However, I said to myself : You've got to spendA night in the heather. Well, you've known worse beds,And worse bed-fellows than a sheep or soâ€”Trying to make believe I wasn't frightened. And then, somehow, I couldn't, God knows why !But I was scared : the loneliness, and all;The quietness, and the queer creepy noises;And something that I couldn't put a name to,A kind of feeling in my marrow bones,As though the great black hills against the skyHad come alive about me in the night;And they were watching me ; as though I stoodNaked, in a big room, with blind men sitting,Unseen, all round me, in the quiet darkness,That was not dark to them. And all the starsWere eyeing me; and whisperings in the heatherWere like cold water trickling down my spitie;And when I heard a cough. . .Dick : A coughing sheep.Tramp : May be : but 'twas a coughing ghost to me.I've never yet set eyes on a ghost, unless . . . (looking askance atThough I've often felt them near me. Once, when I. . [Dick.But, Iyord, I'm talking, talking . .Dick : I've seen ghosts,A hundred times. The ghosts of reivers rideThe fells at night; and you'ld have ghosts in plentyAbout you, lad, though you were blind to them.But, why d' you fear them ? There's no harm in ghosts.Kven should they they ride over you, it's onlyLike a cold wind blowing through you. The other night,As I came down by Girsonsfield, the ghostOf Parcy Reed, with neither hands nor feet,Rode clean through me ; the false Halls, and the CroziersClose on his heels, though I kept clear of them; And often I've heard him, cracking his hunting-crop,On a winter's night, when the winds were in full cry ;And heard the yelp of the pack, and the horn's halloo,Over the howl of the storm, or caught at dawnA glimpse of the tails of his green hunting-jacket.Whenever you shudder, or break in a cold sweat,Not knowing why, folk say that someone's steppingOver your grave ; but that's all stuff and nonsense.It's only some poor ghost that's walking through you.Tramp : Well, ghosts or sheep, I'd had my fill of them ;Went all to pieces, took to my heels and ran ;And hadn't run three yards, when I pitched headlong.That was the first. Since then, I've felt the bottomOf every hole, five hundred to my reckoning,From there to here.Dick : You've covered some rough ground.But you have doubled back upon your tracks,If you were making North.Tramp : Aye : I was makingFor Scotland. I'd a notion . . .Dick : Scotland liesUnder your left heel, though your right's in England.Tramp : To think of that! Well, I can't feel much differenceTwixt one and the other. Perhaps, if I'd my boots off ... .But, Hamlet's father, isn't it a king's bedWe're lying on, and sprawling over two countries !And yet, I'd rather be in Millicent Place,London, ,S. E., and sleeping three in a bed.This room's too big for me, too wide and windy; The bed, too broad, and not what I call snug :The ceiling, far too high, and full of eyes.I hate the loneliness. I like to feelThere are houses, packed with people, all about meFor miles on miles; I'm fond of company;I'm only really happy in a throng,Crowds jostling thick and hot about me. HereI feel, somehow, as if I were walking nakedAmong the hills, the last man left alive.I haven't so much as set eyes on a house,Not since I left that blistering road.Dick : The nearestIs three miles off. or more.Tramp : Well, country-peopleShould be good neighbours, and quiet; but, for me,I'd rather be packed like herrings in a barrel.I hate the loneliness: it makes me think.I'm fond of company; too fond at times.If I hadn't been so fond of companyA while back, I'ld hardly have been lying nowOn Bloodybush Edge, talking of ghosts at midnight,When I might be . . . but it won't bear thinking on.Yet, even with you beside me, Bloodybush EdgeIs a size too big in bedsâ€”leaves too much roomFor ghosts, to suit my fancy. Three in a bed,And you sleep sound.Dick : And why should you fear ghosts,When, one fine night, you'll be a ghost yourself ?How soon, who knows ! Why, even at this moment,If you had broken your neck among the moss-hags You'ld be your own ghost sitting there, not you.If you hadn't been so muddy, and so frightened. . .Nay ; but I've seen too many ghosts in my timeFor you to take me m. Ghosts often leanOver me, when I'm fishing in the moonlight.They're keen, are ghosts. I sometimes feel their breathUpon my neck, when I am guddling trout;Or the clutch of their clammy fingers 011 my wristWhen I am spearing salmon, lest I miss.And always at the burning of the waterYou'll see them lurking in the shadows, beyondThe flare and the smoke of the torches, in the night,Eager as boys to join in the sport; and at times,When they have pressed too near; and a torch has flared,I've seen the live flame running through their bodies.But oftenest they appear to me when aloneI'm fishing like a heron ; and last nightAs I stooped over Deadwater, I felt. . .Tramp : And you're an honest man to be asking questionsOf gentlemen on tour ! So, you're a poacher,A common poacher : though it must be rare sport,I've often fancied. . .Dick : To creep up to a poolWhere a big bull-trout lies beneath a boulderWith nose against the stream, his tail scarce flicking;To creep up quiet and without a shadow,And lie upon your belly in the gravel;And slide your hands as noiseless as an otterInto the water, icy-cold and aching,And tickle, tickle, till you have him fuddled; Then lift him, cold and slithery, from the burn,A quivering bit of silver in the moonlight. . .Tramp : Aye, that must be rare sport; but, for myself,I'ld rather manage without the help of ghosts.Once, I remember, I was bending downâ€”'Twas in an empty house . . . I'd cut my thumb,The window jamming somehow, a nasty cut:The mark's still there . . (not that! nay, that's the placeI was bitten by a friend) and as I fumbledWith a damned tricky lock, some Yankee patent,I felt a ghost was standing close behind me ;And dare not stir, or squint over my shoulder :But crouched there, moving neither hand nor foot,Till I was just a solid ache oi terror,And could have squealed aloud with the numb cramp,And pins and needles in my arms and legs.And then at last, when I was almost dropping,I lost my head, took to my heels, and boltedHeadfirst down stairs, and through the broken window,Leaving my kit and the swag, without a thought:And never coming to my senses, tillI saw a bullseye glimmering down the lane.And then I found my brow was bleeding, tooâ€”At first I thought 'twas sweatâ€”a three-inch cut,Clean to the bone. I had to have it stitched.I told the doctor that I'd put my headThrough a window in the dark, but not a wordAbout my body following it. The doctor,He was a gentleman, and asked no questions.A civil chap : he'd stitched my scalp before Once, when the heel of a lady's slipper . . .Dick: So youAre a common poacher, too ; although you takeOnly dead silver and gold. Still, it must beA risky business, burgling, when the folk . . .Tramp : Risk! aye, there's risk ! That's where the fun comes in :To steal into a house, with people sleepingSo warm aod snug and innocent overhead;To hear them snoring as you pass their doorsWith all they're dreaming of stowed in your pockets ;To tiptoe from the attic to the basement,With a chance that you may find on any lardingA door flung open, and a man to taclde.It's only empty houses I'm afraid of.I've more than once looked up a pistol's snout,And never turned a hair . . . though once I heardA telephone-bell ring in an empty houseâ€”And I can hear the damned thing tinkling yet. . . .I'm all in a cold sweat just thinking of it.It tinkled, tinkled . . . Risk! Why man alive,Life's all a risky business, till you're dead.There's no risk then . . . unless ... I never fearedA living man, sleeping or waking, yet.But ghosts, well, ghosts are different somehow. There'sA world of difference between men and ghosts.L,et's think no more of ghostsâ€”but lighted streets,And crowds, and women ; though it's my beliefThere's not a woman in all this country-side.Dick : There's womenfolk, and plenty. And they are kind,The womenfolk, to me. Daft Dick is ever A favourite with the womenfolk. His bellyWould oft go empty, were it not for them.Tramp : You call those women, gawky, rawboned creatures,Thin-lipped, hard-jawed, cold-eyed ! I like fat women.If you could walk just now down the Old Kent Road,And see the plump young girls in furs and feathers,With saucy black eyes, sparkling in the gaslight;And looking at you, munching oranges,Or whispering to each other with shrill gigglesAs you go by, and nudging one another ;Or standing with a soldier eating winkles,Grimacing with the vinegar and pepper,Then laughing so merrily you almost wishYou were a red-coat, too! And the fat old mothers,Too old for feathers and follies, with their tightNigh-bursting bodices, and their double chins,They're homely, motherly and comfortable,And do a man's eyes good. There's not a sightIn all the world that's half as rare to seeAs a fat old wife with jellied eels and porter.Aye, women should be plump . . . though Ellen AnnWas neither old nor fat, when she and IWere walking out together, and she'd red hair,As red as blazes, and a peaked white face.But 'twas her eyes, her eyes that always laughed,And the merry way she had with her. . . But, Lord,I'm talking ! Only mention petticoats,And I'm the boy to talk till doomsday. Women !If it hadn't been for a petticoat, this momentI might be drinking my own health m the bar Of The Seven Stars or The World Turned Upside Down,Instead of . . . Well, Old Cock, it's good to haveSomeone to talk to, after such a day.You cannot get much further with a sheep ;And I met none but sheep, and they all scuttled,Not even stopping to pass the time of day,And the birds, well, they'd enough to say, and more,When I was running away from myself in the dark,With their " Go back ! Go back ! "Dlck â€¢' You'd scared the grouse.They talk like Christians. Often in the dawn . . .Tramp: Bloodybush Edge! But why the Bloodybush ?I see no bush. . . .â€¢' Some fight in the old days, likely,In the days when men were men. . . .Tramp : j little thought,_ 1When I set out from London on my travels,That I was making straight for Bloodybush Edge.I had my reasons, but, reason or none, it's certainThat I Id have turned up here, someday or other :For I must travel. I've the itching foot.I talk of London, when I'm well out of itBy a hundred miles or so ; but, when I'm in it,There always comes a time when I couldn't stayA moment longer, not for love or money :Though in the end it always has me back.I cannot rest. There's something in my bones They 11 need to screw the lid down with brass screwsTo keep them in my coffin. When I'm dead.If I don't walk, I'll be surprised, I . . . Lord, We're on to ghosts again ! But I'm the sortThat's always hankering to be elsewhere,Wherever I am. Some men can stick to a jobAs though they liked it. I'm not made that way.I couldn't heave the same pick two days running.I've tried it: and I know. I must have change.It's in my blood. And work, why work's for fools.Dick : Aye, fools indeed: and yet they seem content.Content! why my old uncle, Richard Dodd,He worked till he was naught but skin and bone,And rheumatism : and when the doctor told him :" You must give up. It's no use ; you're past work."'' Past work," he says, " past work, like an old horse :'' They shoot old nags, when they are past their work." Doctor," he says, " I'll give you five pound down'' To take that gun, and shoot me like a nag."The doctor only laughed, and answered, " Nay."" An old nag's carcase is worth money, Richard :" But yours, why, who'ld give anything for yours! "They call me daftâ€”Daft Dick. It pleases them.But I have never been daft enough to work.I never did a hand's turn in my life :And won't, while there are trout-streams left, and women.And I am a traveller, too, I cannot rest.The wind's in my bones, I think, and like the wind,I'm here, to-night; to-morrow, Lord knows where !Tramp : London, perhaps, or well upon the road there,Since I'm on Bloodybush Edge.Dick : Nay, never London.I cannot thole the towns. They stifle me. I spent a black day in Newcastle, once.Never again! I cannot abide the crowds.I must be by myself. I must have air:I must have room to breathe, and elbow-room,Wide spaces round me, winds and running water.I know the singing-note of every burn'Twixt here and High Cup Nick, by Appleby.And biids and beasts, I must have them about me.Rabbits and hares, weasels and stoats and adders,Plover and grouse, partridge and snipe and curlew,Red-shank and heron. I think that towns would choke me;And lld go blind shut in by the tall houses,With never a far sight to stretch my eyes.I must have hills, and hills beyond. And bedsâ€”I never held with beds and stuffiness.I'm seldom at my ease beneath a roof:The rafters all seem crushing on my head,A dead weight. Though I sleep in barns in Winter,I'm never at home except beneath the stars.I've seen enough of towns ; and as for the women,Fat blowsy sluts and slatterns. . . .Tramp : Easy, Old Cock !" What's one man's meat . . ."as che saying is ; and so.Each man to his own world, and his own women.(They sit for awhile smoking in silence Then Daft Dick beginssinging softly to himself again.)Dick : (singing)" Their horses were the wrong way shod,And Hobbie has mounted his grey sae fine,Wat on his old horse, Jock on his bay; And on they rode for the waters of Tyne." And when they came to Chollerton Ford,They lighted down by the light o' the moon ;And a tree they cut with nogs on each side,To climb up the wa' of Newcastle toun."Tramp : What's that you're singing, matey ?Dick : " Jock o' the Side.A ballad of the days when men were men,And sheep were sheep, and not all mixter-maxter.Thon were brave days, or brave nights, rather, thon !Brave nights, when Iyiddisdale was Iyiddisdale,And Tynedale, Tynedale, not all hand-in-glove,And hanky-panky, and naught but market-hagglingTwixt men whose fathers' swords were the bargainers!That was a man's work, riding out, hot-trod,Over the hills to lift a herd of cattle,And leave behind a blazing byre, or to stealYour neighbour's sheep, while he lay drunk and snoringâ€”A man's work, ever bringing a man's wages,The fight to the death, or life won at the sword's point.God ! those were nights : the heather and sky alowWith the light of burning peel-towers, and the windRinging with slogans, as the dalesmen met,Over the singing of the swords:"An Armstrong ! An Armstrong ! "" A Milburne ! A Milburne !"An Elliott! An Elliott! "" A Robson ! A Robson ! "" A Charlton ! A Charlton !"" A Fenwick! A Fenwick!'' " Fy, Tynedale, to it! "" Jethert's here ! Jethert's here ! "" Tarset and Tarretburn !" Hardy and heatherbred !" Yet! Yet! "Man, did you ever hear the story toldOf Barty Milburne, Barty of the Comb,Down Tarset way ? and how he waked one morningTo find that overnight some Scottish reiverHad lifted the pick of his flock : and how hot-footHe was up the Blackburn, summoning Corbet Jock:And how the two set out to track the thievesBy Emblehope, Berrymoor Edge and Blackman's By Blakehope Nick, and under Oh Me Edge,And over Girdle Fell to Chattlehope Spout,And so to Carter Bar ; but lost the trailSomewhere about the Reidswire : and how, being lothTo go home empty-handed, they just liftedThe best sheep grazing on the Scottish side,As fair exchange : and turned their faces home.By this, snow had set in : and 'twas sore workDriving the wethers against it over the fell;When, finding they were followed in their turnBy the laird of L,eatham and his son, they laughed,And waited for the Scots by Chattlehope SpoutAbove Catcleugh: and in the snow they fought,Till Corbet Jock and one of the Scots were killed,And Barty himself sore wounded in the thigh;When the other Scot, thinking him good as dead,Sprang on him, as he stooped, with a whickering laugh : And Barty, with one clean, back-handed blow,Struck off his head, and, as they tell the tale," Garred it spang like an onion along the heather."Then, picking up the body of Corbet Jock,He slung it over his shoulder; and carried his mateWith wounded thigh, and driving the wethers before himThrough blinding snow, across the boggy fellsTo the Blackburn, though his boot was filled with blood.Or the other tale, how one of the Robson ladsStole a Scot's ewes : and when he'd got them home,And had mixed them with his own, found out, too late,They'd got the scab : and how he went straight backWith a stout hempen rope to the Scot's house,And hanged him from his own rooftree by the neckTill he was dead, to teach the rascal a lesson,Or so he said, that when a gentleman calledFor sheep the next time, held think twice about itBefore he tried to palm off scabbit ewes.Poachers and housebreakers and bargainers !Those men were men : and lived and died like men ;Taking their own roadâ€”asking no man's leave;Doing and speaking outright, hot and clean,The thing that burned in them, and paying the price.And those same gawky, rawboned women motheredSuch sons as these ; and still do, nowadaysâ€”For hunting foxes, and for market-haggJ ing !You fear no living man! A glinting bullseyeDown a dark lane would not have set them scuttling.They didn't dread the mosshags iti the dark.And seemingly they'd little fear of ghosts,Being themselves so free in making ghosts. Ghosts ! why the night is all alive with ghosts,Ghosts of dead raiders, and dead cattle-lifters;Poor, headless ghosts ; and ghosts with broken necks . . .See that chap, yonder, with the bleeding thigh,On a grey gelding, making for Hurklewmterâ€”A horse-thief, sure . . . And the ghostly stallions whinneyAs the ghostly reivers drive their flocks and heids . . .[listening)They are quiet now: but I've often heard the patterOf sheep, or the trot-trot of the frightened stirksDown this same road . . .Tramp : Stop man ! You'll drive me crazy !Let's talk no more of ghosts ! I want to sleep.I'm dog-tired. . . but I'll never sleep to-night.What's that ... I thought I heard . . . I'm all a-tremble.My very blood stops, listening, in my veins.I'm all to fiddlestrings . . . Let's talk of London,And lights, and crowds, and women. Once I metA chap in the bar of The World Turned Upside Down,With three blue snakes tattooed around his wrist:A joker, he was ; and what he didn't knowOf women the world over you could shoveBetween the nail and the quick, and never feel it.He told me that in Valparaiso onceA half-breed wench that he . . . but, Lord, what's that!(A low distant sound of trotting drawing quickly nearer).I thought I heard . . . Do you hear nothing ?Dick: Naught.Tramp : I'm all on edge; I could have sworn I heardâ€” Where was I ? Well, as I was saying . . . God !Can you hear nothing now ? Trot-trot! Trot-trot!I must be going crazed, or you're stone deaf.Dick : Nay, I'm none deaf.Tramp: It's coming nearer, nearer . . .Trot-trot! trot-trot! Man, tell me that you hear it,For God's sake, or 111 go mad !Dick : No two men everMay hear or see them, together, at one time.Tramp : Hear what ? See what ? Speak, man, if you've a tongue !Dick : The ghostly stirks.Tramp (starting up) : The ghostly stirks ! Trot-trot!Trot-trot! They're almost on us.

B SONNET Rupert Brooke Suggested by some of the Proceedingsof the Society for Psychical Research. Not with vain tears, when we're beyond the sun,Well beat on the substantial doors, nor treadThose dusty high-roads of the aimless deadPlaintive for Earth; but rather turn and runDown some close-covered by-way of the air,Some low sweet alley between wind and wind,Stoop under faint gleams, thread the shadows, findSome whispering ghost-forgotten nook, and thereSpend in pure converse our eternal day;Think each in each, immediately wise;Ivearn all we lacked before; hear, know, and sayWhat this tumultuous body now denies;And feel, who have laid our groping hands away;And see, no longer blinded by our eyes. A MEMORY (from a sonnet-sequence.) Somewhile before the dawn I rose, and steptSoftly along the dim way to your room,And found you sleeping in the quiet gloom,And holiness about you as you slept.I knelt there; till your waking fingers creptAbout my head, and held it. I had restUnhoped this side of Heaven, beneath your breast.I knelt a long time, still; nor even wept.It was great wrong you did me; and for gainOf that poor moment's kindliness, and ease,And sleepy mother-comfort!Child, you knowHow easily love leaps out to dreams like these,Who has seen them true. And love that's wakened soTakes all too long to lay asleep again.Waikiki. October, 1913. ONE DAY. To-day I have been happy. All the dayI held the memory of you, and woveIts laughter with the dancing light o' the spray,And sowed the sky with tiny clouds of love,And sent you following the white waves of sea,And crowned your head with fancies, nothing worth,Stray buds from that old dust of misery,Being glad with a new foolish quiet mirth.So lightly I played with those dark memories,Just as a child, beneath the summer skies,Plays hour by hour with a strange shining stone,For which (he knows not) towns were fire of old,And love has been betrayed, and murder done,And great kings turned to a little bitter mould.The Pacific. October, 1913. MUTABILITY. They say there's a high windless world and strange,Out of the wash of days and temporal tide,Where Faith and Good, Wisdom and Truth abide,Aeterna corpora, subject to no change.There the sure suns of these pale shadows move;There stand the immortal ensigns of our war;Our melting flesh fixed Beauty there, a star,And perishing hearts, imperishable IyOve Dear, we know only that we sigh, kiss, smile;Bach kiss lasts but the kissing; and grief goes over;Iyove has no habitation but the heart.Poor straws! on the dark flood we catch awhile,Cling, and are borne into the night apart.The laugh dies with the lips, " Iyove " with the lover.South Kensingtonâ€”Makaweli,1913- THE OLYMPIANS Lascelles Abercrombie It is in Crete, a many years ago :Under a peak that strained in icy stoneTo thrust an endless gesture at the stars.Two peasants, son and mother, in their hutWere talking : mouth close against ear they talkt,Because a great storm poured over the hutA sound of rain, driven so hard it smacktAgainst the walls like pebbles thrown in volleys;And, carrying this, a rushing sound of windThat fled through woods, tearing itself, and blewAcross the mountain piled above the hut,Making the rocky hollows and ravinesSnore like monstrous jars in its pauseless breath.Yet it was time for pleasant days. The earthâ€”All winter long s'nce dried in her, and deathSearcht out and crumbled in the ground by frostâ€”Waited for spring to burn her once again,Ready as tinder is for touch of fireTo thrill its tranced nature and unsealThe striving self-creative will of flame.Yea, full time now for the woods to toss their flame,Burning with every green that water knows:From the green gold of oaks, like mounded wavesIn green mid-sea full of a golden gleam,To birches like the quiet depth besideSheer downward cliffs, where shallow light of greenIs mixt with blue from under. And alreadyFlowers began to hire the wings of beesAt a delicious wage to carry love,Their golden ttrade, to far off unknown mates. But the storm came, and with its wind trod out,And drencht with its rain, the spring's sweet travelling fire.Not heeding the loud air, these peasants talkt.Son : But 'tis a trade despised.Mother : By tongues that goIyike tails of cows in summer, flicking the clegs:They flourish their lithe talk in the air, to switchThe flies of jealousy that so prick their minds.Is it despised ? I,ook you, is man a beast,Or is he man ?Son : He's man till he's a corpse;And then he should be filth ; and scorn's the thingFor those whose trade is dabbling among filth.Mother : The kitten miaows his scorn ! But think on it,That you'ld be nothing of the handsome manYou take yourself to beâ€”you'ld be a lumpOf worse than dungâ€”dabble your thought in that!â€”If I'd not had my trade and fed you on it.Son : I know all this. But what I mean to sayâ€”I am grown now to work for both of us,And leave corpse-tending be.Mother : No gain in that,And loss a plenty. You've a name abroadFor your strong work, Milon himself no better.And I've my name for setting corpses right;As much to me as any feats to you.Son : My name's honest: it's queer you love your scorn.Mother : Is man a beast, I say, or is he man ?And what is most the man in him ? 'Tis pride. And go through all his uses, you'll not seeHis pride standing taller and more daringThan in my trade. Naught lives but must lie downHelpless, and fastened in a tomb must letThe earth at her detestable slow pleasureMeddle with what was once so much delight.Well, shall man go to his disgrace like beastsAll in a desperate huddle ? Not he ; hell goA neat corpse, a polite death. While he holdsThe shape of man, he will have decent prideAbout the shape. And 'tis from me he has it.I, the scorn'd crone, who stretches out dead men,(But the boys daren't halloo me !) I think myselfIyike a worn twisted shell the tide has beachtWhere man may find it, marred with an age of journeyUnder the sea, and ruffian'd by the stones;But if he set his purposed lips againstThat knockt shell's breakage, he can make it soundA booming call, will thunder down the surf.And so his brave breath uses me ; he sendsThrough my lame toil his purpose to be manAnd his own reverence past the great stound of death,Announcing it even to his own corruption.Son : You make it out a fine thing. But I'm sure'Tis a vile business you were best be quit of.Mother : Truly I like my corpses, and the wayI make death prouder sign of man than life.I like to watch, with hiding of my smiles,The mourners making much of themselves with grief,Howling themselves into their neighbours' notice; And I the while knowing myself aloneThe mind that has allowed their ceremony,That caught death up out of wretchedly beingAn asham'd riddance of poor carrion lumber.And sometimes I will eat their sins, poor fools :'Twere pity if I made the look of deathDignity sleeping sound, and left the spiritA writhen thing, mean with a useless fear.Son : It is because they set you down so low,You the straker of corpses, they can bearTo think of you defiled by death without,Defiled within by meals of their rank evil.Mother : them be thinking; they give me their sinsLike children laying pranks of mischief onTheir kindly nurse, who smiles to bear the blame.As speech will drop from those who talk in quiet,Because a sudden blow of dinning noiseFalls there, and leaves the silence like stunn'd thought,But ringing like a breadth of metal: soThese, who here talkt in an unheeded rageOf noise, were startled dumb because there smoteUpon the steady roar of hurlymg airAbout them, huge and heavy and swift silenceDown like the shock of hammer. No smallest whineOf sound moved under it, all so instantlyThe night was tyrannized, though in their brainsThe breakers of the wind were shouting still.And their amazement had not nerved their tonguesTo venture stir of speech in the grave quiet,Before the door rattled, and an old man Came in, limping, hideous, crooked with age.Unshod his feet, but in foul gear of mud,And tatter'd shame were all his clothes. He stoodAnd bleared upon the candle, stoopt and gaping.Upon his wiry trembling neck pusht out,The weight of his head was poised like a baboon's;And the draught played with his spare goatish beard.From pucker'd clefts as red as wounds his eyesIyookt weeping ; but the bone of his brow and face,Though peering horribly through the stretcht and scorchtMask of his tann'd age, was framed to holdThe governance and decree of mighty spirit,Superb above control of common fate,Before this ponderous disease of yearsHad clung about it. For a striving whileSome still unmastered royalty in himWould right the toughen'd warping of his spine;But could not. Then he spoke. His voice,Clear strength with feeble harshness jarring through it,Was like a trumpet when the brass is flawed ;So nobly in the hollows of his skullThe sound was muster'd, but began from stringsSo slack and fretted, and with rheum so hinder'd." O Cretans, he is dead ! "He stumbled back,And then came burdened in again ; he boreLapt in a goatskin bundle some small weightA boy would swing in single-handed play;But he with strains and age's gasping grumbleWorkt hard to be its porter. Up to the bench He sidled, backt against it, bent his knees,And with a grunt he let his parcel slideDown the hunch of his shoulders. Then to his hostsHe turned, with dropt jaw quivering, eyebrows upHigh-pitcht in anxious bridges over their sockets;And from the thrust of them the curving horrourPusht his forehead rugged up to his pateIn creases of bald skin ; like the half-roundsOf ripples pusht backward by a buttressAgainst a steady stream. He faced them so,All signed with the absurd deformityThe labour of grief must be content to earnWhen it is working for life pincht in age.And leaning over the small thing that layWrapt up before him, at last he spoke again.Old Man : He is dead now, and you must be with meIn burying him.Mother : A baby ! And by your speechYou're some outlandish vagabond. It will beYou've made some demon happy with the bloodAnd burnt fat of the bairn ; ay, it has beenSome wizard's murder, I'll be bound. And nowIt's I must get you quit of your pitiful rubbish !But you are wrong there.SÂ°n â€¢' You go too hard upon him.Look how his mind stares from his ancient face,Posed to make out your wording, what it means.He's honest, sure, and brings no harm in him.Mother : What, an old shabby man who tramps abroadIn a fiends' holiday of a storm, and brings I,apt up strangely and slung on his wicked backA dead baby ! I warrant, he deals in them ;He is a sorcerers' monger. I would knowMore of him, if he wants my skill. And the wind,When he came in, fell down from noising aloft,Headlong down as a drunk man falls, who runsBlind and shouting over a cliff: belikeThat means some wicked league goes faithful with him.â€”Whose is this baby ? Have you strangled it ?Son : The grasp, see, of those wavering hands would scarceStrangle a worm.Old Man : You said the wind had fallen ?Yes, surely it would : I should have noted it.Indeed, they would call it off, whistle it backTo kennel, now it has worried him to death.I pickt him up, and bore him in my armsHither, soon as I knew he was to die.But that fierce hound of a storm was after usAll my stumbling way ; it tore at him,And with a hundred dreadful snatching jawsWould jerk him from the fold of my trembling armsWhere he lay snuggled, whimpering to be safe.And terror at last of all that hatred yellingInto his face and biting at his limbsForced death upon him ; he was so weak, so weak ;Breath could not live in such a shaken body.So it is ended now; now he is yoursTo wash and bury : and will you eat his sins ?Mother : An easy mouthful that, poor bairn ! Ay, sadTo think of all the lusty cheerful sins He might have played with, but for that killjoy death.O I will eat his sins : I've had my mealsOf rapes, murders, and jeering at the gods,And never known them quarrel with me yet,Not even saying a twinge of colic against me.Ay, baby ! your little secret spawn of sinsWill make no bother for my heart: soft roeWere tastier, but not milder in my belly.Iyook, sir; this is the trick we use.â€”Boy, be stirring, undo the poor wee brat.She took a crust, sopt it and salted it,And gave it to the crouching man ; and heOver the bundled thing upon the benchHanded the morsel back. She muncht it down,Then turned to bustle with her needs, and getHer skill in order for the laying out.Truly she was unwilling ; but their mindsThrilled strangely in the look of his tarnisht eyes,That sent invisibly burning rays amongTheir pierced thoughts, and gathered them to shapeThe act of his desire, like powder'd ironDrawn into pattern of a magnet's force.Yet as she turned from bolting down that crustHer casual rite had made bitter as tears,A sign for the reproach of sin, his faceWent blank with timid wonder, in its stareAfter her busily searching corners and cupboards;L,ike an old puzzled ploughman at a fair,Who gapes after a juggling tightrope dancer,Seeing him, when his risky show is done, Push unconcerned and whistling through the crowd:So he was looking, as it were dreadfully strangeShe made so little of those eaten sins.Meanwhile, she ferreting for cloths and pans,And the ancient traveller lost in his feckless gaze,The son was fingering the feeble knotsThat kept the stranger's baggage,â€”very loathTo pluck the ragged hide unfastened, yetHe could not fumble there for long, so slackAnd such a foolish work the tying was.A stealing cat, left in a room aloneWhere supper's on the table, smelling outA dram of milk low down in a narrow jug ;Careful not to be noisy and not to spill,Her dainty paw dips in and soaks her fur,Then daintily draws out again and licksThe dripping theft. Even so gingerlyInto the bundle's folds his hand went loosening.She heard, the mother bustling with her things,Suddenly heard, from where she left her son,Such a harsh gasp of forced desperate breathAs comes from lungs coopt in hard agonyOf terror, muscles clencht about the bonesIyike a red-hot tyre that shrinks on a smoking wheel.She turned, and saw her boy in palsy, his armsFixt half-way raised, and eyes that could not winkBut only glare into the opened pack.She scurried to him ; and a grim thing layFor her to see : no baby, but a manUnbelievably withered into age, The cinder of a man, parcht and blastedTo smallness like a baby, puny and dried,His body all drawn up into a fist;The pined legs, crooked as burnt candle-wicks,So taut with perisht sinews that their kneesThrusted the shrivelled belly; and his armsHugg'd his chest with little graspless hands.Brown as though age had scorcht like fire at lastAnd full of creases was the ancient skin.But nothing babyish was the wasted headThrawn on his chest (and bigger than his chestThe great head seemed) : the sharpened edge of jaws,With thin beard scanted to a crisp grey wool;The lean nose peaking like a puffin's bill;And brow and brain pan smooth as it were wrought wood,But vaulted for a god's imagination.Horrour was feasted in their minds. But he,The wretch who brought with him that dreadful luggage,Still lookt towards where the woman had been busy,Moveless but for the bent knees shivering,A standing swoon, empty of all but sorrow.They turned on him; the life in them broke looseFrom pausing aghast, and clamoured like a streamBursting a weir: the son threaten'd, and sheWrung his shoulder and spoke in angry fear:" L,eave off your doating, you monstrous old man ;What's this you've brought us ? " Then again he triedTo brave the burden of his years and standUpright before their question ; and againHe summoned from his wreck of royal lifeCommanding voice: it came broken and crippled To serve him, and five words were toil enoughNow for the voice of his greatness to endureBefore it fainted:" Zeus ! It is Father Zeus ! "Grief seemed to clench his body. Down he fellFrom difficult stature and lay crouching thereAs low as worship before these poor folk ;And from the heap came shaken whispering :" The thundering Zeus! His favour was the prayerOf gods and men, his sentence was their lives.Now he is that small twisted husk ; and I,This halt misery of perishing age,I am Apollo, I am Apollo ! "A long while, sobbing and with shrill breath, he lay ;At last, his head a little sideways turned,He told his tale, in voice all dwindled smallTo husky twittering, a hissing whineThat sometimes went into a peewit-squeak:Ivike to the rustling drag of a fray'd ropeOver a pulley creaking in its rust,When he that hauls is tired and often waits.Apollo : We were upon the mountainous Height of the godsThat has the whole world under it; and thenceâ€”I,ike mountain-water feeding the fuming seasâ€”Divine life down from our lofty quiet streamed,Down where the tides of men were labouringIn hollow earth, and rolling to and froTheir floods of brackish fortune: into the depthsOf all that living brine we poured our power,Fresh heavenly water sweetening the vast salt, A shining song into the helpless roaring.But lately there had seemed some growth of changeTo hold the speed and plenty of our gift:As on the flanks of ancient naked stoneAges of water grind sheer rock to soil,And soil at last grows into moss and weed,Till falling water soaks the whole hillsideAnd drips from ledge to ledge of sodden turf.And to our sight, scanning the scope of timeEasily as the distance of the earth,Appeared, behind the haze of things to come,Enormity, disaster crouching low,Like darkness charged with fireâ€”the far-off sleepOf ruinous purpose, dreaming itself awakeIn dreams that made the dark drowze suddenly blaze.We glanced at it as feasted men will lookAt lightning, when the storm is so far offThe winking glare burns noiseless as the starsAlong the rim of pale sweet summer-dark,Giving a moment's shadow to the trees.Or if fear toucht our hearts, it was as lightAs tickling threads of spider-work will touchThe face of one who loiters in the evening.We knew how the whole drift of living worldLies in the nets of law, that hoist and dragTheir booty of Existence out of depthsUnknown to land it dying none knows where.But, for the ages while that cast is drawing,We thought the pressure of its grasp would fallUpon us through our element as mild As light, the sun's command, shines through a poolOf rippled water, and rules with quivering gleamThe sand that sleeps beneath in golden nets.Certain, within the world's slow draught, our keepStood mountainous above the tides of men ;And they, in surge against its sightless prowOf anchor'd stone, were spent about the hugeFoundations of our fate, and backward failedInto surrendering spray from rearing towards us.Zeus the Father assembled us, and spoke:" It has been known, that from some other sourceThan our divinely streaming mountain, menHave tempered the old brine of mortal souls.Gods like a wandering rain have plenisht themWith sweetness, when perhaps our gift was stayed:Bacchus we found descended among menOut of the flying winds of shapeless spirit,Dying into them like a rain at sea,Shedding divine fresh water of his lifeOver their salty torrent, and againFrom out the depths of them rising a ghostPure of the bitter earth they have dissolved,Again to pour on them immortal moods.We treated with him to dwell here, to takeA heavenly name, and to be Dionysus.So we did well, and he."We turned to smileBrotherly pleasure on our lovely guest.He was not in his place ; he was not foundIn heaven that day, the last of heaven's days.Where had he gone, our belov'd Dionysus ? The Father spoke again: "On the low earthNow in a patch of men another godAppears. Despise him not, Olympian gods!Him too we will persuade into our manner;What has been once well done, may be again."So to mankind we bent. Our gaze devouredThe height that made the press of flocking livesMolten in one vague to-and-fro of sea ;Our eager sense closed with the life of man,Till the whole sight of it roaming the earthIn single swaying flow, one driven tide,Crumbled into passionate wilful menInnumerously seen, in separate hastesWrangling their groping purposes. We foundAmid the ruffle of confused small errands,That moil of jarring wills, a piece of earthWhere all the crossing lives seemed to be strokedInto one pause of strain'd wondering orderBy ruling passage of some great event;As when there have been floods upon the fields,The matted twigs and straws of broken woodsL,ie combed and laid and handled by the water,All packt one way. So these lives, massed and straighten'd.Were held from their loose custom in a firmIntent, towards where they had three of their kindHung up on gallows crosses. Bleak they spikedIn twilight against splendid cloudy flamesOf scarlet evening. It was a low bare moundThat thrust these cruelties up at the sky,So that it seemed the half-nave, and the polesThe jutting spokes, of a great ruin'd wheel Sunk to the axle in the fens of life.But in the heaven behind it, the sun's raysWere like a wheel of white-hot burning gold,Terrible whirling spokes of spouted fire,The blazing pillars of a wheel that fledOver the earth travelling gloriously.For we had found the stranger godâ€”a godHang'd and dying between murderers :Once more a god kill'd for earthly worship !His death was while we lookt and said, " He dies,He dies ! Again it is a god that dies ! "But in his death this was a mightier godThan those that died before. There fell on usAt once a frost of horrour from above.Darkness was perfect over us : it wasTime, the immense muster'd power of the wholeTime of the world, stowed in one moment's nature.The darkness we had seen far off, that wasThe mere length of our lucid view in timeEnding as darkness, like to searching lightIn a clear depth of water losing itself,â€”That darkness of our sight was real nowAnd triumphing,â€”vengeance for all the debtWe had not heeded owing, neglected timeGathered into a single storm that struckA single fire of all the years till then,Blasting us instantly into dry age,But leaving us a while to feel our deaths.And I saw Zeus, charr'd to that infant posture,Iyie shrunk before me with bound twitching limbs,With helpless rocking head and puling breath; And with the last of my divinitySet out to nurse him hither, bearing himTo die where he was born, in Crete.He stopt.He was so still they thought death had him now,But kept their stared astonishment unmovedUpon him. 'Twas uot death ; for soon they sawShudders in his old body, and his hands workAs they would dig the floor to clutch in it.The woman stole a pace to see what ailedHis quivering silence ; and she found his eyesAppalled, reading some terror in the door.She lookt towards his fear : it was a gleamThat came from the outside darkness, piercing throughThe cracks at sill and lintol and the warptParting of the worm'd cross-ledged boards. It shoneMore white than any flame or the sun's self,As white as stars and eager as the sun.Kver closer and brighter it seemed to comeAgainst the door, thronging upon it, jettingWhere any seam it found to let it throughIyike pressure into the shadowy room. They thoughtIt must push on the door with torrent force,Such bursting light came through; and they were dazedTo see the timber did not shake and give.And now the door's whole wood was full of light,As if it had been paper against the glare,The grain like a fiue web of glowing threads.And of a sudden there was no door, but whiteBlinding vacancy, measureless light; And in the midst a young man glorious.He stood among them, lookt at Apollo, and laught.Apollo : Unhurt, unaged ! Dionysus ! Thou !Bacchus : Call me no more that name. All Bacchus nowI am, and have nor heavenly name nor nature.Apollo: lam disguised to thee, Bacchus, I think.Bacchus : I know you, cripple, easily as I knowThat shrivelled rind yonder was Father Zeus.Apollo : And thou hast mightier divinity !Else that I take thee with the ashamed new senseOf this incapable mortality.â€”Didst thou desert us, knowing of our doom ?Where hast thou been ? How art thou grown so radiant,Escaping our destruction, thriving in it ?Bacchus : You never understood me in Olympus.Your ignorant bland friendship grew to meMore tiresome than a fawning fondling loveTo one in whom love sickens. You courteous gods!â€”What ailed me, siding with that mummy there ? â€”Your serene feasts! And I sitting among youParleying with your boasts of immortal reign ;And this despair of yours chained murderousIn my dark heart, tugging to hunt you downThe slope of heaven to graves in the base earth.Ay, bury your Zeus, else 'tis a god that stinks !Apollo : How are you safe, when no Uranian godBut dies, or goes, like me, an idiot palsy ?Bacchus : For that I am not, though once seated there,A heavenly god! And I have lodged among The gods of hell, those cobwebs in your cellars,Fine-spun wavering silk of the nether dirt,And am not hellish either. Know you not,Now you are doddering, how the vast dead worldLives, as all death lives, as dead Zeus will live ?Apollo : Will live ?Bacchus : In maggots, if such withered stuffCan rot at all. And as death lives in wormsAnd points of finer death-dissolving life,The immense death of the world lives in gods,Bred in it by decay of unity.Like gentles with their potent little mouthsSoftening stiffen'd death to the broth they need,You gods workt in the carcase of the worldTo melt its obstinate death, and made thereinPowers and laws and fluid obedience.And quickened so, ye were the life of the world ;But what comes out of death, death takes again.â€”He winces ; and I taunt where I should teach.lam too cruel: I will shift my likeness,Making my lesson out of sleep, not death.For one who sleeps hath in the midst of restBusy creation, dreams: they are himself,His unknown person shaped to image known ;The many unflagging toils whereby his fleshNegotiates life, labouring of lungsAnd piston-jet of blood and belly's seethingâ€”The rumour of all this out of his bodyShakes in his slumbering brain, and its dull motionThere meets imagination's sleepless art; And into phantom event,â€”sound, hue, and figureâ€”Is forged familiar to his will's desire ;And this is dream. Even so in the sleep of the worldGods are dreams. The great imagining spirit,That lives sealed fast within the drowzed world,Is always toucht by steady obscure turmoilOut of its own surrounding nature thrillingConfused and generalâ€”the slumbering world'sLabour of being hugely still itself;Like humming din that fills the masonryOf a mill's inmost darkest room. And this,The murmur of its own substantial life,The spirit imagines into dream, the lifeOf gods : and man is the sleeping spirit's brain,Where it contrives the fictions of its will.But there are dreams that shine and move in musicAnd after vanish ; and there is one dreamThat always stays : and I, I am that dream.For know me now at last!â€” What is the worldThat sleeps so busily around the spirit,Quickening its restless forgery of dream ?It is the chance of a seeming-steady whorlOf motion shaped on infinite pouring depths:Rapture that is for ever not the worldCaught in a wavering spin, and gone for ever,The whorl abiding, incessantly suppliedFrom the unending unbeginning stream.I am the water of the eddying world :In me the spirit hath dreamt the ceaseless rushOf constant being swept through changing manners. I am a god not apt for heaven and hell;Measureless joy and measureless woe, I amThe rapture that is not the world, for everNarrowed into the world and thence escaping.But you, what dreams are you ? What prompts you godsThat live so stately in your heaven and hell,Order'd delight and bounded grief ?â€” You areNaught but the shifty manner of this life,That shaping eddy which hath made a worldIn the abyss of the eternal water.And who knows not that eddies slide and totter ?The dream of youâ€”the formal round that keepsCreated the unpurposed nameless passionâ€”My uncontrollable dream with inroad strangeHath often shaken ; now it has burnt among youWithering you all at last. There is naught of you,There is naught but a new dream of me. How else ?The shape of the whorl has stirred and changed : the worldIs no more what it was when you were dreamtIts images. But it is not my hurt,For I am always dreamt and to be dreamt.Apollo : But there will be our like again : in godsThe spirit will know again the shapely courseAnd music of the measured world.Bacchus: While you,Timorously haunting there, applaud !But not if, as I mean, I keep the spirit,Now I have all its sway, amazed in longThrilling dream of incredible desireForsaking still its momentary round Of measure in the world, a god of hopeThat anguishes for flight beyond all nature.And let the new gods come. They cannot stay;I shall be in among them, and shall bidFarewell to their fleeting heaven, when once againThe circling world shifts into some new shape.Ay, even as nowâ€” Farewell, shall I say ?Fare as ye may, dead god and dying god !He spoke and laught again and was not there.The glimmering room came back about them likeThe blackness of a cavern ; and they stood still.At last that old Apollo, without words,Bade their blank minds be his. The woman washtAnd dried the crumpled wreck of Zeus ; her sonGathered it in the goatskin to his breast;And in the quiet night the three went outTo climb the Cretan mountain. " Haste ! BeforeI see the sun, bring me and my businessTo the last height of the peak " : so the god's thoughtWorkt in their minds and drove them. Misty dawnWas known already by the crags, called forthTo watch each other in their lonely frostsEnduring still, while all the bottom earthThey seemed to suffer for slept in its cloud.These peasants and the god at length had climbedThe top of Crete ; and, like a common task,To throw aside the loosen'd weather'd stonesThe son bent down, scooping a shallow hole,The grave of Zeus; and there the panting womanL,aid in its package the Olympian corpse. Apollo spoke to them across the grave.Apollo: True is, lam cut off ; true what he said,Bacchus refresht in splendour when we die down;For our occasion fails from under us.The cliffs of the mountains in this cloudy lightSeem lifted free from their low ground, the earthNow voided and annulled which bore them upLike sublime faculties : in perfected heightOf patience and hard honour amid fate,They seem, for their cwn ceaseless glee alone,Iyeft here in bright erect self-maintenanceArduous. So may it not be with the gods,Since with the gods, whatever seems is truth :It was our glory ; now it is our death.For now hath clouded change come in betweenThe earthly life and us ; our far-off groundSeems blotted from beneath us, though it is there.But 'tis enough that it so seem : we crumble,We are left insupportable, ruining.You look your last upon the broken gods.Bacchus remains, I know not what new BacchusGuising his everlasting deity.Will he content you ? Will you love for longTo serve him with a scorn of shapely law,Of bounded measured life under the stars ?At last will you not know his godhead isThe vengeance of the uncreated passionOn that which holds it in creation, you,The living world ? And a delicate vengeance !" Deny the seeming beauty of the world, Follow me out of seeming ! " This is the cry.How long before whatever seems becomeOlympian truth again ? How long shall beThe glory of your world reckon'd its shame ? â€”You minds that seize the rage of infinite forceAnd master it to seem desirable,A firm and shining world, you take a godWho turns your triumph to a meddling sin,And holds you contrite for it! Ay, say it pours,That formless race of being, pours through youThe real and eternal of your lives :Have this sheer being for your god, you makeWorthless yourselves, worthless to be the world.But all the measured fires that fill the skyRejoicing in their glittering certainty,The times of earth, and waters in their rounds,And your own shapely thoughtâ€”all this that isSeeming and mortalâ€”this is your mastery!â€”The seizure into boundaries of beautyThat overcomes the eternity in you.Make this your god, and life is its own value.Will you have life once more that loves itself ?Then of the world shaped into radiant seemingIn midst of flux, let there be Zeus again ;Yea, and another son of Zeus, a newApollo, god of the life that knows itselfMade of eternal being, but made with powerTo shape the eternal into mortal world.So prophesying was the end of him.His wretched figure sunk to crooked kneeling ; His mouth gaped as lie would be speaking still,But only choked ; with jerks of throttling gripHe laid hold on his windpipe like self-murder ;And then he bowed his head, and tumbled downBeside that other. Quickly the peasants moved,Released from him, but not yet from his fear,To load his death, piling a cairn of boulders.Back in their hut, son and mother no wordHad for each other a long while. At lastThe woman, stirring about dinner, spoke:" Boy, you shall have your way. From to-day onI*et no one come to me for washing corpses." c o THE POET TO HIS MISTRESS John Drinkwater If 1 should takethought of gentlenessFor your dear sakeThan for the poignant labours that possessMy blood, then surely by so much were signedMy shame and loss in the world's recording mind.If you should beJealous of my desire,And, loving me,Rebuke my patient hopes from your sweet fire,Then would you take a lover to your bedAbased with the pale submission of the dead. THE NEW MIRACLE Of old men wrought strange gods for mystery,Implored miraculous tokens in the skies,And lips that most were strange in prophecyWere most accounted wise.The hearthstone's commerce between mate and mate,Barren of wonder, prospered in content,And still the hunger of their thought was greatFor sweet astonishment.And so they built them altars of retreatWhere life's familiar use was overthrown,And left the shining world about their feet,To travel worlds unknown.* * â™¦ *We hunger still. But wonder has come downFrom alien skies upon the midst of us;The sparkling hedgerow and the clamorous townHave grown miraculous.And man from his far travelling returnsTo find yet stranger wisdom than he sought,Where in the habit of his threshold burnsUnfathomable thought. THE BOUNDARIES Although beyond the track of unseen starsImagination strove in weariless might,Yet loomed at last inviolable barsThat bound my farthest flight.And when some plain old carol in the streetQuickened a shining angel in my brain,I knew that even his passionate wings should beatUpon those bars in vain.And then I asked if God omnipotentHimself was caught within the snare, or free,And would the bars at his command relent,â€”And none could answer me. A TOWN WINDOW Beyond my window in the nightIs but a drab inglorious street,Yet there the frost and clean starlightAs over Warwick woods are sweet.Under the grey drift of the townThe crocus works among the mouldAs eagerly as those that crownThe Warwick spring in flame and goldAnd when the tramway down the hillAcross the cobbles moans and rings,There is about my window-sillThe turn ult of a thousand wings. MEMORY One told me in the stress of daysOf ease that memory should bring,And so I feared my trodden waysFor snares against my labouring.Lest I should spend my brain amissIn wrath for bitterness gone by,Or amorous for some old kiss,I would not deal with memory.Because one saidâ€”' In memoryIs half the health of your estate,'I smote the dead years under me,I smote, and cast them from my gate.
