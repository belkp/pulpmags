who changes all things cannot  change Eternal themes Ah who shall dare to join The sad procession of the kings of song  Irrevocable names that sucked the dregs Of sorrow from the broken honeycomb Of fellowship or brush the tears that hang Bright as ungathered dewdrops on a briar Death hallows all but who will bear with me To breathe a more heartrending lamentation To mourn the memory of a love divided By life not death a friend not dead but changed  Not dead but what is death Because I hoard Immortal love that withers not but keeps Full virtue like some rare medicament   Hoarded for ages in a crystal jar By wonder working gnomes that only waits The sound of that lost voice familiar still Or sight of face or touch of hand to bring Life like the dawn whose gentle theft unties The girdle of the petal folded flowers And ravishes their scent before they wake My love is like a fountain frozen o er But no returning sun will ever break The seal of that forbidden spring no foot Invade the weed grown pathway never kiss Wake the enchanted beauty of the wood And bid the wheels of time revolve again Though one should walk the ways of life and wear The sweet remembered name yet he is not My playmate no the boy whom I have loved Died long ago the man is nothing but His aging sepulchre  And I even I Know in my deepest heart that I am not The boy who loved him and I would I were With a most bitter longing which there are No creeds to comfort Do we madly feign The soul to be immortal Fools it is not Even mortal does not last the little space The body does but alters visibly And dies a million times twixt breath and breath   Forever and forever and forever Outgrown and left behind and cast away The joy that was the blossom of the soul And hours that were the butterflies of time What though Elysian fields be white with light Crowded with glorious forms and freed from fear Or spoil or shock how shall it profit me Aged with sad hours to pass to them and meet Him as he is removed and fallen and marred Hath any God the power to give me back My boyhood to undo this growth of years In which I lose the sense of what I was And take a different nature We self wrapped Conjure with dreams of immortality And wit not that the spirit is yet more frail Than that which holds it Constant is it in nothing But change the transmigration of the soul Goes on from hour to hour it does not wait The dissolution of our frame but is The law of life fulfilled in even wise And we who fear destruction perish ever  The soul that vaulting speck that busy flame That climbing passion flower that god that atom It is the seeding point of forces fed By earth and air and all we hear and see And handle We take life and give it but We may not keep it Sooner might we hope To clutch the trickling moments in our palm   Take hold of the eternal pendulum And bid the sun of our desire to stand  Who can take comfort to foresee himself On unknown stages playing other parts It is but treading through a wider maze A wearier cycle Would the butterfly Feel lesser anguish as it fell to know Some egg in which it wrapped the spark of life Was ripening in the dark some day to break Its natal bonds and walk the earth enrobed With green and golden fur Or is it worth The caterpillar s knowing as it shrinks Within the coffin it has built and dies Between the straightening walls that they shall crack In ruin days or weeks or ages hence And issuing from the dust a thing of light Not it shall drink the morning air and wave Its crimson banners in the sun  A life Of endless deaths an immortality Of partings is it worth being gifted with Such is the life of nations they last on In plant like continuity while the men Who make them fall like leaves and are renewed We call ourselves the English people now But they who fought till sundown on that hill In Sussex all those hundred years ago And died where they had fought and never knew   Baldur  The end of it what had they happier been To hear of the great Charter and the deeds Of that famed Parliament that drew the sword Meteor like forth in shuddering Europe s gaze And spilt the blood of kings  Let no man say Life may yield other loves because we loved At that age when to love is to be lost In them we love and not with narrow eyes To purse up faults and merits In that age We loved although we knew not how to love Before the buds of sense had learnt to give Their sweetness up in fiery fatal blooms And fruit forbidden Childhood treads the heights Whither nor friends nor loves of later days Can reach when friends are but acquaintances And love s clear stream is muddied o er with lust  Forever and forever and forever Gone are the days and nights of fairyland Days that were cups of summer sacred nights Too sweet for slumber hours like tears on which The moonbeams peeped between the shuttered blinds Like children at a feast they cannot share O memories Oh to steal from paradise One more such moment and then be no more I Those years and loves are gone not to come back Till man can turn the wheels of life and draw Creation in the thoroughfares of time   HOLIDAYS  As the tree puts forth its flowers Time at certain seasons dowers Men with moments so delicious They forget all former hours  Magic hints that wake the mind From the sleep that seals mankind Raptures tumults yearnings visions Light that breaks upon the blind  Charmed in circles of the sea Island of love s mystery There are old pathetic secrets Only known to you and me  Children of the summertide Free from care and wrath and pride We were happy while we wandered Up and down the long sea side  Round the seagull s rocky home Azure waves through fretted foam Glanced and glowed like lancet windows Sapphire in an ivory dome  Far afield a rain of light Washed the utmost sea wave white Heaved and rolled in blinding splendor League on league of chrysolite   Did we tread on beaten ground Were the waves that rocked us round Lapping on some isle of wonder Dropped within the coral sound  Fainter than a cloud the moon Floated up the sky too soon Round us on the brooding valley Slept the summer afternoon  Every golden hour went by Like a bead of tracer Strung upon an Indian necklace To enchant a sultan s eye  How the stars that hallowed night Seemed to pulse with our delight Notes of some mysterious music That we dared not read aright  Every star that downward fell Struck far off a mystic knell Then the whole wide heaven about us Boomed to silence like a bell  Something softer in the air Whispered to our hearts beware It was an enchanted region And we might not tarry there   Long we sate and never spake Lest the light illusion break We had fallen asleep together And we could not bear to wake  Never to that haunted shore Bid me bend my voyage more Bitter thorns are left to harvest Where we gathered blooms before  FINIS  Like a great sunset drawn beyond the sea A visionary landscape framed in fire Of earthquake cities toppling tower and spire  Downward through rifts and gulfs of phantasy  So pass the memories of old love from me Never to thrill again that inward lyre Aeolian whose sad strains of sick desire  These grosser measures breathe imperfectly  There is no love but first love all beside Is passion s lightning or affection s moon I floated once on that triumphant tide  But stranded now among the wrecks and spars I watch the night succeed the afternoon And bide my sleep beneath the ancient stars  Allen Upward   MAY IN THE CITY  THE NEWCOMERS  Spring has come in the city And the sun and the rain And a thousand spirits swarming from God knows where Push the buried grasses And pull them Calling Go out jump out And these little ones break through Wink at us and taunt We are naked fresh and green And you are not  LOVE LYRIC  Stir Shake off sleep Your eyes are the soul of clear waters Pigeons In a city street  Suns now dead Have tucked away of their gold for your hair My buried mouth still tastes their fires  A tender god built your breasts Apples of desire   Their whiteness slakes the throat Their form soothes like honey  Wake up Or the song bird in my heart Will peck open the shell of your dreams  Sleep my own Soaring over rivers of fire Sleep my own Wading waters of gold  Joy is in my heart It flutters around in my soul Softly I hear the rosy dreams   MIDNIGHT  Midnight The air is still And yet there seems to be a sound Brooding in it tearing I hear it With all my quivering body But not with my ears Suddenly it bursts muffled hoarse detached From any earthly object It is spring Charging through the night   The Willow Tree  THE WILLOW TREE  Willow tree You are a little sea With laving foaming waves I ll put my heart in there To float To eddy in the eddies  STORM Storm Wild one Take me in your whirl In your giddy reel In your shot like leaps and flights Hear me call stop and hear I know you blusterer I know you wild one I know your mysterious call  THE RED LIGHT  The red light is out Sleep gnaw your way In the dead tired body And in the limbs which cry out  Enter dawn Hop about little bird of light   Hop gently with upturned claws Over the thrown down body Over the extinguished hair  Tree which grows near the house Spin and twine your shadows in there Burn with your shadows Wind around her your tendrils Limpid god  IN THE PARK  I am slowly wheeling my child In the swarming park The sky sheds skeins of darkness As delicate as light The stars curl in their coverlets And allow the thin light To drift from between their fingers The moon like an earnest priest Seems bent on holy business  But the trees are capricious they display or conceal Part of a torso or a knee or reveal A poem of branches The little water is thick with mystery As a lake in a forest The grass Tickles my soles and I can feel The earth under rich Yet almost incoherent   A Hymn to Night  A HYMN TO NIGHT  Come mysterious night Descend and nestle to us  Descend softly on the houses We built with pride Without worship Fold them in your veil Spill your shadows  Come over our stores and factories Hide our pride our shame With your nebulous wings  Come down on our cobbled streets Unleash your airy hounds Come to the sleepers night Light in them your fires  Max Michelson   TO A GOLDEN CROWNED THRUSH  Hurled from a fairy catapult Up like a song gone somersaulting Up like a dream to the white moon vaulting I hear your liquid voice exult  Half to the moon I hear you sigh Like trees and ripple on like brooks The magic of the wild wood nooks You shake out through the silver sky  Oh tell me are you bursting so With secrets that the woodlands tell That you must hurtle from the dell And up so all the air shall know  Are you a song and nothing else Gone tumbling up the night of June Is that your form against the moon That trembles palpitates and melts  Now your crescendos note on note Like one last challenge wildly pour And then you float to earth once more Unseen as dreams and silence float  Richard Hunt   SHEILA EILEEN  She wore a kirtle of bright cramoisie A golden band her slender waist confined The wise ones said that half a sprite was she So light her foot and lighter still her mind  And thus it happened on the eve of May In spite of many a threat and warning word She with the fairies nimbly danced away And never any news of her was heard  But when the summer rested on the glen And birds sang and the roses blossomed free One said he heard a silver laugh again And glimpsed a kirtle gold and cramoisie  CARNAGE  Over the valley swept the Autumn flood In showers of leaden bullets fell the rain The firs swayed to and fro drunken with pain And wounded maples stained the earth with blood  Antoinette DeCoursey Patterson   INDIANA  This is my Indiana There where those long low lines of blue Lie soft against the sky Beyond the trees that mark the river s course And here these fertile fields Level and vast A mother earth indeed Generous and sacrificial Oh I could kneel and kiss This rich black loam  And here a gate that leads into a school The gift of one plain man to generations And over there the town upon the hill Where the ancient cross rises to our skies too Above the square of commerce The court house stands  And Indians soldiers and muses of the Greek Riot together on its frieze  Here on this wide free road The farmer gives me greeting From his high seat atop a load of yellow corn He lives untroubled king upon a free domain Where tasseled fields stretch to the sun Those golden ears   Are symbol of the pact he keeps With Indiana  Dear land of common good Where on new soil The old world hopes are more thanWhere freedom justice opportunity Wrested in blood and tears From the slow centuries Are free free gifts to all  AN OLD SONG  All day an old old song Has echoed in my mind And will not be dismissed A song that tinkles Of youth s endearing charms And love that will not die  It clashes with the thoughts Of this iron time Its chasms of hate Its lines of cleavage Its unsparing sight And bitter revelations The plough is going through us We are aghast and stern   Indiana  dreams  Still tinkles faintly Out of a hundred years The sweetness of the little song It sounds like some faint hidden brook In a lost fairy land Of the long ago  Daphne Kieffer Thompson  FORGIVENESS  Now God be thanked that roads are long and wide And four far havens in the scattered sky It would be hard to meet and pass you by  And God be praised there is an end of pride And pity only has a word to say While memory grows dim as time grows gray  For God His word I gave my best to you All that I had the finer and the sweet To make a path for your unquiet feet  Their track is on the life you trampled through Such evil steps to leave such hallowing Now God be with you in your wandering  Charles L O Donnell   SKETCHES IN COLOR  COLUMNS OF EVENING  The evening seems the ghost of a purple roofed house That once held repose The leaning columns Seem to have pulled down the sky to their tops With long unseen arms  HAPPINESS  The moon like the ash colored wraith of a candle flame Hangs bewildered in a gaudy blowing afternoon So does your little joy hide itself  The crippled sunlight drags its huge orange limbs Over a tiny squatting hill So does your joy pass over me  At the end of a red capering afternoon The dizzy trees bow slowly to the sun So do I salute your happiness  SUFFERING  The morning lowers its fire veined back And quivers beneath the edged feet of winds So do you stoop to your agony   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The air brushes up the fibrous souls Of flowers and sprinkles them between The flickering sleeved arms of lime trees So does your sorrow whirl you apart  The brocade robed night staggers against the wall of the  sky And fiercely sinks its woe turbaned head So does your grief lean upon me  A MAN TO A DEAD WOMAN  Shaking nights noons tame and dust quiet and wind  broken days Were hands modeling your face Yet people the best of them glanced at you and passed on  And now perhaps some of them meet to say little true  things of you Quickly weighing tiny stray chips of you They who did not know you  THE WINDOW WASHERS  Kneeling on high flimsy scaffoldings Their lives measured by the strength of ropes The window washers liquidly mumble little songs That are scooped away by the running air As flowers are swept up by racing children    The Window washers  They descended men whose skin is close over their bones And whose hair is scant  Why have you grinning faces of wood You who have been carved by the white sword of the wind But the window washers stared and tapped their foreheads And trudged off to drink much beer  THE DEPARTMENT STORE  This squinting moon faced man is measuring lavender silk For a muffled little eyed girl Only the counter lies between them but they do not see  each other  This waxen lipped girl whose eyes are like burning silk Is selling a frilled white waist To a sleepy faced old woman in flaring clothes They are both secretly amused  And this middle aged iron bodied woman is wrapping candy For a fat delicate faced man in black clothes  Rarely do they peep above the low wall between them To look upon each other  Maxwell Bodenheim   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PYROTECHNICS  I  Our meeting was like the upward swish of a rocket In the blue night I do not know when it burst But now I stand gaping In a glory of falling stars  II  Hola Hola shouts the crowd as the catherine wheels  sputter and turn Hola They cheer the flower pots and set pieces And nobody heeds the cries of a young man in shirt sleeves Who has burnt his fingers setting them off  III  A King and Queen and a couple of Generals Flame in colored lights Putting out the stars And making a great glare over the people wandering among  the booths They are very beautiful and impressive And all the people say Ah By and by they begin to go out Little by little The King s crown goes first   Pyrotechnics  Then his eyes Then his nose and chin The Queen goes out from the bottom up Until only the topmost jewel of her tiara is left Then that too goes And there is nothing but a frame of twisted wires With the stars twinkling through it  Amy Lowell  TO A FLOWER  Child whose fairy eye Is filled with azure dreams Gazing on the sky Youth today must bleed On battlefields and die Thy loveliness it seems Is but a lie  Suzette Herter   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A LITTLE GIRL  I  I see a little girl sitting bent over On a white stone door step In the street are other children running about The shadows of the waving trees flicker on their white  dresses  Some one opens the door of the house And speaks to the child on the steps She looks up and asks an eager question The figure shakes her head and shuts the door The child covers up her face To hide her tears  II  Three children are playing in the garden Two boys and an awe struck little girl They have plastered the summer house with clay Making it an unlovely object  A grown up person comes along the path The little girl runs to her Asking the same question Where is my mother The grown up person does not make any answer She looks at the summer house and passes along the path   A Little Girl  The little girl goes slowly into the house And climbs the stairs  III  The little girl is alone in the garden A white haired lady of whom she is afraid Comes to find her and tell her a joyful thing  The little girl runs to the nursery The young nurse is doing her hair in frontThe little girl sees how white her neck is And her uplifted arms  Tomorrow they will be gone they willThey are going to find Her The young nurse turns and smiles And takes the little girl in her arms  IV  The little girl is travelling on a railwayEverything rushes by very fast Houses and children in front of them Children who are just staying at home  The train cannot go fast enough The little girl is saying over and over again My mother my onliest mother I am coming to you coming very fast   of the glass  not be here  train  V  The little girl looks up at a great red building With a great doorway It opens and she is led in Looking all about her A lady in a white dress and white cap comes  After a long long time A man in a black coat comes in He says She is not well enough I am afraid The little girl is led away She always remembers the words The man in the black coat said  VI  The little girl is waiting in the big hallway In the house of the white haired lady At the end of the path she can see the summer house With its queer gray cover  The hall clock ticks very slowly The hands must go all around again Before the mother will come  Now it is night The little girl is lying in her bed There is a piano going somewhere downstairs She is telling herself a story and waiting Soon She will come in at the door   A Little Girl  There will be a swift shaft of light Across the floor And She will come in with a rustling sound She will lie down on the bed And the little girl will stroke her dress and crinkle it To make the sound again  Pretty soon the mother will step slowly and softly to the  door And quietly turn the handle The little girl will speak and stop her Asking something she has asked many times before My Father But the mother has never anything to answer  VII  The mother and the little girl are sitting together sewing Outside there is snow A woman with a big white apron Comes to the door of the room and speaks  The mother drops her work on the floor And runs down the stairs The little girl stands at the head of the stairs And cries out My Father but no one hears They pass along the hall  The little girl creeps down the stairs But the door is closed   VIII  The little girl is held and rocked Held so tightly it hurts her She moves herself free  Then quickly she puts her face up close And there is a taste of salt on her tongue  IX  In a bed in an upper chamber A bed with high curtains A woman sits bowed over Her hair streams over her shoulders Her arms are about two children  The older one is trying to say comforting things The little girl wants to slip away There are so many people at the foot of the bed  Out of the window across the yellow river There are houses climbing up the hillside The little girl wonders if anything like this Is happening in any of those houses  X  Many children and grown up people Are standing behind their chairs around a bright table Waiting for the youngest child to say grace   A Little Girl  It is very troublesome for the youngest child To get the big words out properly The little girl interrupts and says the grace quickly  The white haired lady of whom the little girl is afraid Is angry The little girl breaks away and runs To the room of the bed with the high curtains  She rushes in The room is empty She comes back to the table But she does not dare to ask the question She remembers the great red building Wtih the great doorway  XI  The little girl is trying to read a fairy story There is nobody in the garden There is nobody in the house but the white haired lady  Someone comes to tell her her father is there She does not want to see him She is afraid  XII  The front door is open There is rain and leaves are whirling about A carriage with two horses   And a coachman high up holding a long whip Stands waiting in front of the door  The little girl is holding on to the banisters They take away her hands from the banisters And lead her to the carriage in front of the door Someone gets in behind her The carriage door is shut The little girl draws herself to the far corner They drive away The little girl looks back out of the window  XIII  The little girl is in a strange house Where there are young men called uncles Who talk to her and laugh A large lady sits by the table and knits and smiles In her basket are different colored balls of wool Pretty colors but not enough to make a pattern There is a curly soft little black dog That hides under the table The uncles pull him out And he tries to hold to the carpet with his claws The little girl laughs But at the sound she turns away And goes up to her room and shuts the door Pretty soon the large lady comes to her And takes her on her lap and rocks and sings  Mary Aldis   EDITORIAL COMMENT  DOWN EAST  ORE than three years ago when POETRY was  in its first volume I went to New York to  look over that part of the field incidentally  attending the third or possibly it was the  fourth annual banquet of the Poetry Society of America which had been founded in 1910 Last month I took another survey including Boston as well and it may be in order to record a few casual and desultory impressions of change and contrast  In January 1913 the art was still in the old era and one saw few signs of a change of attitude among the constituted authorities The voices most conspicuous today had not then been heard except in some instances in POETRY such voices as Masters Frost Lindsay Sandburg Tagore Rupert Brooke and the whole group of Imagists Four numbers of POETRY had appeared and one of The Poetry Journal but the older magazines were still using verse as an end of the page decoration and the public was serenely indifferent  Now all is changed It is as though some magician had waved his wand presto the beggar is robed in scarlet Indeed the present danger may be that poetry is becoming the fashion a real danger because the poets need an audience not fitful and superficial but loyal and sincere When six hundred persons willingly pay five good dollars apiece to   feast in honor of Mr Masefield and hear him and certain  American confrères exchange farewells the public would  seem to be awakening to some kind of an interest in the art  And other evidences are plentiful A well known poet  tells this story  The other day I went into Brentano s for the first time in  years as it happened to get somebody s poems Now Brentano s  used to keep its modern poetry on a little table away back in a  dark corner under the stair so to that modest corner I went But  when I reached it I found no poetry only shop worn boys books  How is this I said to the clerk have you given up poetry  altogether The man turned on me a withering glance Poetry  he said pointing majestically is up in front  And up in front I found it in high piles on the foremost table  and moreover crowds of people three or four deep were reaching  over each other to buy it  And here is the testimony of a Chicago lover of the art  Not more than five or six years ago I saw in Putnam s big New York shop a loaded table with a placard marked Modern Poetry Ten Cents a Volume And we can t sell it at that price said the clerk  Today I find a tableful of modern verse placed among the best sellers at McClurg s and when I express satisfaction the man replies Yes that s what Miss Monroe s magazine has done  In order not to claim everything this leads me to that other evidence of the renaissance its magazines Is it possible that only three and a half brief years ago we were alone in the field Now a new organ of the art strikes its chord every few months and the air is a quiver with projects still untuned We have not only Others the high pitched instrument of the young intransigeants but Contemporary Verse of Philadelphia which speaks with a Quaker accent for youth s conservatism since youth is by no means always a   Down East  radical And now Mr Braithwaite over in Boston is going to offer us next month The Poetry Review of America no less bringing to the service of this new sheet of a format as large as the New Republic his love of the art and prolonged study of its manifestations in America And there are whispers of still newer schemes in the New York air  As for the poets they seem as numerous as sparrows through the cool spring sunshine and almost as quarrelsome This is not to deride but to declare I have always admired the vigor and enthusiasm with which battles of the intellect are fought in Paris their schools and groups their cliques and labels their solemn assumptions and fine distinctions all the absurd machinery through which alone after all a great metropolis can stage her play and put her artists before their world Well here in our newer world we are beginning to learn the lesson Perhaps the French cubist painters who are now so numerous in New York have brought with them a spark from the Parisian altar flame at any rate our poets have caught fire and an editor who would not be scorched by leaping flames must walk warily between the various groups with banners  At a party given by the editor of Others these fires burned low and this editor was able to attach faces and voices to long familiar names like William Carlos Williams Alfred Kreymborg Skipwith Cannell Horace Holley Cloyd Head without once being called down for an old fogey astray in a youthful world The freshest topic was Zoë Akins play The Magical City which was new at the   Bandbox Theatre and which apparently had got across the footlights to critics and public and now to these various groups of young poets and artists  Afterwards I saw the play and was inclined to agree that Miss Akins had really achieved poetic drama from the rather difficult standpoint of modern romance The feat was a bit acrobatic now and again I thought the play was going to lose its precarious balance not when the captain of industry spoke his stern few words to the much desired girl but when the truly poetic poet stood dithyrambically speechifying at him with the murderous pistol in his hand Yet in spite of this occasional excess of eloquence the lines were full of life and informal rhythmic beauty And the play had that sine qua non dramatic magic it acted well and rounded up with style to an unexpected and shapely climax On the whole a most promising beginning for the young St Louis poet playwright  Of a Tuesday evening the Poetry Society of America held one of its regular monthly meetings with the president Mr Edward J Wheeler in the chair and Mr Lawrence Housman as guest of honor Resolutions were passed in honor of the late Ruben Dario the great Nicaraguan poet who did so much to reunite the sundered fragments of the Spanish speaking world and whose dream of a closer Pan American sympathy brought him to this country during the first year of the war and the last of his life The speech of Dario s young compatriot Señor Salomón de la Selva made me understand as never before the importance of the poet   Down East  in Latin American life his power as prophet and leader Will our statesmen dreaming of Pan Americanism ever take this hint  In Boston I attended a meeting of the New England Poetry Society which happened to be entertaining the Harvard Poetry Club I own to intense interest in the work of this latter group of students twenty or more young men who have gathered together without aid from the Harvard faculty for the study and practice of modern verse Many brief poems were read by eight or ten different authors and their quality as Mr John Gould Fletcher and I agreed was surprisingly high  I wish I could remember names in order to check them up when we hear from those young poets later One of them read a sonnet or two which had real verbal and rhythmic magic Two quatrains by another moved me A young man from the West read a gay and slashing free verse satire on Brattle Street and another offered us a ballad of really distinguished quality showing a feeling for recurrent tragic rhythms and a delicate use of a varied refrain In fact I could scarcely overpraise the work of these students or the enthusiasm which has carried them so far in the one short year since their club was founded Young poets in other colleges should organize similar societies And at last the various faculties will be compelled to take notice  H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REVIEWS  CHICAGO GRANITE  Chicago Poems by Carl Sandburg Henry Holt amp Co  New York  In this American melting pot the English language becomes the mother tongue of the sons of Perse and Slav and Swede and through that language and the literature born in it more and more as time goes on must blow tropic and arctic airs winds from East and West perfumes of Araby and salt spray from the northern seas No prophet can measure the ultimate enrichment of our art through this enrichment of our racial strain Provincialism will hardly survive and our democracy of precepts and precedents an Anglo Saxon inheritance like our language from the patterned and fenced in past will have to expand to the larger tests of cosmopolitanism and human brotherhood  From certain of these newer Americans and their sons have come of late at once the harshest challenge and the most idealistic appreciation of this incomplete but urgent and hopeful democracy which they find here Such voices as Sandburg the second generation Swede Giovannitti the Italian Rosenfeld the Yiddish Jew Ajan the Syrian are uttering at once the challenge and the ideal with a passion rare among poets of the Anglo Saxon stock Of these latter at this moment only Edgar Lee Masters and C E S Wood of Oregon occur to me as bent upon the same business in the deepest sense a poet s business of seeing our national   Chicago Granite  life in the large its beauty and glory its baseness and shame  Carl Sandburg has the unassailable and immovable earthbound strength of a great granite rock which shows a weather worn surface above the soil Like such a rock he has a tender and intimate love of all soft growing things grasses lichens flowers children suffering human lives One would no more question his sincerity than that of the wind and rain His book whether you like it or not whether you call it poetry or not is fundamental in the same majestic sense it is a man speaking with his own voice authoritatively like any other force of nature  I remember the emotion with which I first read many of these poems in type written sheets sent to POETRY over two years ago by some friend of the poet That first conviction of beauty and power returns to me as I read them again This is speech torn out of the heart because the loveliness of yellow dust on a bumble bee s wing of worn wayfaring men of ships at night of a fog coming on little cat feet the incommunicable loveliness of the earth of life is too keen to be borne or because the pain of the poor patient and toiling of children behind mill doors of soldiers bleeding in the trenches all the unnecessary human anguish is too bitter for any human being poet or not to endure in silence  Mr Sandburg knows his Chicago and the book as a whole gives us the city in a masterpiece of portraiture The town its streets and people its parks and broad lake and the sand dunes beyond the whole half formed metropolis   is painted in broad vital strokes and rich colors by the loving unflattering hand of an artist Here are a few details  LOST  Desolate and lone All night long on the lake Where fog trails and mist creeps The whistle of a boat Calls and cries unendingly Like some lost child In tears and trouble Hunting the harbor s breast And the harbor s eyes  USED UP  Roses Red roses Crushed  In the rain and wind Like mouths of women Beaten by the fists of Men using them O little roses And broken leaves And petal wisps You that so flung your crimson To the sun Only yesterday  Mr Sandburg s free verse rhythms are as personal as his slow speech or his massive gait always a reverent beating out of his subject They are rugged enough at times as when he salutes Chicago stormy husky brawling and sets her high among cities with lifted head singing so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning In some of the war poems his rhythms pound like guns boom   Chicago Granite  ing and when he talks back to the loud mouthed Billy Sunday the swing of a smashing prose hammer is good enough  But again under softer inspiration this poet s touch becomes exquisitely delicate Indeed there is orchestral richness in his music he plays divers instruments Such lyrics as The Great Hunt Under Beachy At a Window The Road and the End have a primal fundamental beauty a sound and swing as of tides or bending grain Many of these POETRY has had the honor of printing but this one is new  UNDER  I am the undertow Washing tides of power Battering the pillars Under your things of high law  I ara a sleepless Slowfaring eater Maker of rust and rot In your bastioned fastenings Caissons deep I am the Law Older than you And your builders proud  I am deaf In all days Whether you Say yes or no  I am the crumbier To morrow  The spirit of the book is heroic both its joy and its sorrow It says Keep away from the little deaths  H M   THE INDEPENDENTS  Catholic Anthology 1914 1915 Elkin Mathews London  Compared to Mr Braithwhite s annual poetry salon this book might be called a

should perhaps say dancing but I believe that sober thoughtful walking is a form of dance in itself We have Harold Monro s real and cute Cat and interesting Suburb And we have a very beautiful Williams William Carlos Williams In Harbor  Alice Corbin in One City Only gives her heart to us entirely for a while laying bare every nook and cranny of her mood  In Mr Rodker s interpretation of a young girl s passion the drawing of her heart and the fear in it before she submits to her lover and the terror and happiness after a study purposely misnamed Twilight and Lunatic I do not find the reverence for sheer truth which I find in Tolstoi s treatment of these situations nor the gentleness and tenderness of Maeterlinck by whom this poet seems to be strongly influenced It is carelessly read Maupassant or Bourget and worse   The Independents  I liked both Carl Sandburg s The Harbor and The Road and the End In the latter the poet allows the subject to carry him to a certain extent instead of his carrying the subject but the reader is carried along just as strongly The pulse of the line in The Harbor is normal in The Road and the End it is a little fast yet I think Mr Sandburg is better in these rhythms than in his later and slower ones where he is often a little monotonous  The selection from Mr Kreymborg s works does not do that writer justice the poem about the toothless pirate is much better than the one in this volume Orrick Johns rather crude symbols are not to my taste Nor am I entirely satisfied with M B our Chicago friend Maxwell Bodenheim In my opinion this writer seems to believe that his readers are not deeply critical and does not perfect his work It is perhaps less noticeable in In Old Age than in Crucifixion for instance where he begins with a concrete image and ends with a cliché Allen Upwards Chinese Lanterns in spite of their new wisdom seem to have something hoary in them like all good lore  Douglas Goldring s tapestry story makes one who has not read anything else of his wonder what that fellow has up his sleeve There is an interesting experiment in conversation poetry by T E Hulme and a preface poem by the  W B Yeats of 1916 who is a somewhat different poet from the earlier Yeats a poet of deeper wisdom and more austere rhythms  Of the selection from Mr Pound well whenever I read   him I seem to forget for awhile what I am reading and think of the man of his self abnegation He is to me the most interesting figure in the recent awakening of poetry Like Cézanne he always seems to say I am nothing my work is everything What Cézanne would have said with a scowl and in different terms Mr Pound cries out with a damn you perhaps Do you think this piece too simple crude thin But this is the way He will translate another writer instead of writing something of his own for you to admire if he believes it will show you the way He will be vulgar noble profane just to show you One only wishes that he would stop brooding about himself in his weaker moments and forget the legend that he is so much disliked  Of course one misses many writers he would like to find To me a collection of modern poems is incomplete without  H D and four or five other writers  I do not quote anything from the book because I believe every intelligent person interested in poetry should own it  Max Michelson  TWO BELGIAN POETS  Maurice Maeterlinck a Critical Study by Una Taylor Dodd Mead and Co New York Poems by Maurice Maeterlinck done into English by Bernard Miall Dodd Mead and Co Poems of Emile Verhaeren selected and translated by Alma Stretteli John Lane London   Two Belgian Poets  The Cloister a Play in Four Acts by Emile Verhaeren translated by Osman Edwards Houghton Mifflin Co  Maurice Maeterlinck and Emile Verhaeren are both vital figures in the literature of their country in fact they cannot be far from the same age For twenty years English speaking people have been familiar with Maeterlinck s works he has been a force in their literature and has given to their poetry and drama a new infusion of life Yet Verhaeren writing in French for three decades influential among French writers everywhere and conspicuous in the new movement in poetry Verhaeren who has bared the bleeding soul of the Belgium of today has only recently been at all widely translated into English Of course we have heard of his genius for years but he has not been a master in our thought a name upon even English and American tongue as has Maeterlinck We must look for a reason  The author of America when asked what in his opinion caused the widespread affection for his song replied that he was sure it was the word my He said that he had at first written Our country tis of thee but that this line hadn t the right go He changed the universal to the more intimate word and the song became famous  Verhaeren paints splendid landscapes flaming narratives large beliefs larger hopes gives out a wealth of sound and color makes ennobling pictures of life s every day Maeterlinck enters the very sanctuary of self touches its inmost problems terror love dread sacrifice sickness death Thus   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  to humanity in general humanity not yet emancipated from self he naturally makes the stronger appeal  From the first Maeterlinck was fortunate in his translators for Richard Hovey put a poet s enthusiasm and sympathy into his version of the early plays plays whose magnificent promise none of his later works has quite fulfilled Alfred Sutro has done almost as well with his later works Now Miss Una Taylor in her Critical Study shows herself especially fitted to wrestle with his inscrutabilities to pierce his subtleties and give us on the whole a right estimate of his work She could deal with her subject comprehensively even without the aid of her wide knowledge of other subjects She is at home with Juliana of Norwich with Serenus de Cressy with Novalis the latter so near to the heart and mind of Maeterlinck She keeps well in march with the great Belgian in her philosophical analysis her exhaustless I might say her fatiguing researches into the mystic In considering the earlier dramas she lays stress upon the malady of humanity tingeing their symbolism and says too little of their matchless beauty For in spite of dank moats pestilential marshes sickly minds these earlier plays have a far greater charm and significance than we may find in any of Maeterlinck s other work Though heavy with Greek fatality though we may liken each play to a bas relief of a group of little weeping Attic sirens they are a fresh and absolutely authentic presentation of the attitude of imaginative youth toward the vague panorama of life and they live forever with the magic dews of dawn still wet upon them   Two Belgian Poets  Mr Miall faced a formidable task when he undertook to put all the Belgian s poems into English verse Maeterlinck s manner is admittedly involved and it seems as if this translation often made him more obscure than he really is If we were at sea in the French we are more at sea in the English In spite of the translator s assurance that he is literal he is not always so how could he be Yet in many of these poems he has made the charm of the original show through the veil of translation and we can see that he has brought to his task the mind of a scholar and the insight of a poet  It is a requisite I think for a good translation of poetry whether it be of the same metrical construction as the original or not whether it be in verse or in prose that no thought and no image should be added to the thought and image of the original Maeterlinck wrote a few poems of such simple and unclouded diction that a child could apprehend them Now clothed in English we find their simple patterns elaborated filmed over to meet the metrical exigencies of another tongue  In The Academy several years ago appeared a call for translation into English verse of a little song by Maeterlinck the text of which was printed in its Paris letter This song was from a volume first published under the title of Douze Chansons and it is perhaps the simplest lyric Maeterlinck ever wrote Many replies were received of which The Academy printed two I have kept these as a reminder of the difficulties to be met in trying to slip into one language the thought of another Let us consider the last stanza   Et s il m interroge alors Sur la dernière heure Dites lui que j ai souri De peur qu il ne pleure   Now see the differences and evasions in the English par  ticularly in the last two lines This is the version by W G  Fulford And if he should question still Of the closing sleep Tell him tell him that I smiled Smiled lest he should weep This is the second by E C M Dart  Can I tell him of the last Late swift hour ere yet thou passed Only say my smiles so gay Flashed to keep his tears away  And here is Mr Miall s later version as printed in the  book before us If he ask me of the hour When you fell asleep Tell him tell him that I smiled Lest my love should weep  Maeterlinck has not said a word about sleep But then hour does not rhyme with weep in English Not one of these three translators has said simply and directly what Maeterlinck himself said Tell him that I smiled lest he should weep  Maeterlinck s poems are the expressions of vague soul conditions pictured by azure glass immobile lilies poison plants symbolical growths ennui and he has made them exquisitely musical These same soul vaguenesses do not seem to yield in the English language the perfume of the   Two Belgian Poets  original However Mr Miall has done wonders with Maeterlinck s intricacies and many of his translations stand the test of tests they read well in English The Hospital might be an English poem it is very strong and in it the translator has caught the cunning of the master s word and image The White Birds has all the listlessness and somnolence of Les Paons Blancs In Glances we find the spirit of the original and many another poem is admirable and impressive  Miss Alma Strettell s version of some of Verhaeren s poems must be disappointing to anyone who opens the book eager for communion with this ardent spirit whose song has moved the world There are here and there good lines artistically chosen words where we almost find what we are looking for The author has followed the text of the original faithfully yet her work is without flavor Her paths are distinctly the paths of tradition She never makes Verhaeren s rain or snow fall but she makes them fall amain In her hands his mesh is never woven it is woven amain She has a childlike way of setting down words as if they were wooden blocks green banks steep far waves dim The Rain is perhaps her best achievement here she has caught the picture and the beautiful monotony of language to a certain extent In The Bell Ringer she has again almost succeeded yet where is the shiver of the original one of Verhaeren s most dramatic and wonderful poems Why does she continually force the great man to pad out his lines by inserting the word so Fancy Verhaeren padding his lines In our search for the real Verhaeren who is a master   of vers libre we are always halted and turned aside by some commonplace word  Mr Edwards is more successful with his version of Le Cloître which though written in 1899 and staged in 1900 was suggested by the poet s experiences in a monastery near Chimay in the early eighties The play which alternates prose and verse is forceful and striking in its purpose Parts of it suggest Le Jongleur de Notre Dame and as we read on through the sweetness and austerity strains of Massenet s music seem borne along the lines But in Le Jongleur we have only the fragrance and beauty of monastery life in Le Cloître there are the fragrance and beauty but also the fierce struggles of mind with mind suspicion against faith as the monks wrangle and argue For even cloistral walls may not keep out the ferment of hate revenge anger jealousy where men gather to say complin worshipping not Christ but each his inward idol Verhaeren s own giant thoughts must have passed through many such dramatic upheavals before Catholicism dropped from him and before he could make Militien say  When faith fell shadowing our shores at length Came Science and sang her own Magnificat  And before he could create The Prior who sighed for  Men of imposing race who from their vouch Are wont to dominate large tracts of time  Surely Verhaeren professedly no symboliste has given us  in the characters of this play many a symbol of the church  in the gentle boy monk service in Balthazar pride and  final atonement through sacrifice   Two Belgian Poets  Today when little Belgium has almost ceased to exist it is extraordinary that two such poets should still be speaking for her to remind us that a nation is measured not by geography or even by military supremacy but by the genius and heroic spirit of her greatest men A F  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  A NEW SCHOOL OF POETRY  Replacing the outworn conventions of the I am bic school we have now the I am it school of poetry NOTE Les I am its

Underwood Johnson erstwhile editor of The  Century sums up his objections to what he calls the form  lessness of modern poetry by an objection not based upon  form but spirit This is what he says  Now if anything is characteristic of the prose librisi it is his lack of a sense of humor A sense of humor is the finest critic the artist can have Poetry having the high seriousness that Arnold considers necessary to it has not needed the guidance of the sense of humor as for example Wordsworth s great ode But in the main a sense of humor is what keeps the poets as well as other people from making fools of themselves  It is hardly true that a sense of humor will keep the poet from making a fool of himself it will however permit the poet to see that he is making a fool of himself from which ha may derive a double satisfaction If great poetry may be achieved without the guidance of a sense of humor poetry is none the less great because of its presence and if I had to choose between them as companions in the desert I think I should take Chaucer and Shakespeare rather than Wordsworth and Milton  But if a sense of humor is the finest critic an artist can have let s hope that the prose librist as Mr Johnson calls Edgar Lee Masters and also by inference Walt Whitman let s hope that Mr Masters tempers all the criticism he receives with at least as much humorous appreciation as that bestowed by this critic upon Mr Masters work  Or is it possible that the high seriousness of criticism does not need the guidance of a sense of humor   Notes  NOTES  The editors regret that they must

SANDBURG  Just Ready 1 25 Net  IN his ability to concentrate a whole story or picture or character within the compass of a few lines Mr Sandburg s work compares favorably with the best achievements of the recent successful American poets It is however distinguished by its trenchant note of social criticism and by its vision of a better social order  These poems show with a wide variety of theme the modern metropolis with its brutality and misery its splendid achievements and unpardonable failures its garishness and its beauty  Though Chicago furnishes the main motif the book has many moods The wistful note of beauty is touched no less frequently than the note of well justified bitterness and resentment It is a composite expressing the many sided city with genuine feeling and undeniable
