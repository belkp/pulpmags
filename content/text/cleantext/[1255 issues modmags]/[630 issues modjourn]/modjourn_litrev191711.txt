Whose DaughterFling me harp notes almost soundlessFrom your hidden white windowYour coming is like a flower petal Wavering down from the skyWalk after meacross the water Like a drifting flowerYou sing of So landand speak of Ko lanclYou seem older than you are And that opens my loveI take your hand and we walk past many springs A Woman Speaks The keenest of swords plunges into leaping water And cannot cut itMy love for you is like that swordBut winds around your heartAfter you gothe weeds shrouding my garden gate Fadeand become the ground of autumnBut spring slips back from your foot marks Prisoned in the soft groundabout the gate The Little Review A Woman Speaks And my heart becomes like a peach blossom On a tree that grows from the bottom of a shallow wellThe peach blossom opens in a smile But whysince he has goneHe was like a quick moon That gave but one moon strandI look down at the water in the well But I cannot recognize myself For I am shrivelled by the lack of himVeil Skirt Her skirt of veils is like curling water Covered with golden nets of frail dustHow can I drop to the bottom of her heartI cannot refuse a thousand cups of green wineHer red cheeks sink into meand make me deadI Go to Visit a Semi God A group of mountainslike blue screensScrape the skyNothing is written upon the blue screensI walk over thempushing apart the clouds And search for a slender roadI lean against a tree And hear rushing springsand see warm flowersA green cow lies amid the warm flowers And white cranes sleep on the tops of pine treesTwilight rises from a lake below the mountainsAnd meets a cold haze from the mountain topsThe Little Review SKETCHES jhWhite ISharpempty airOut of the black mouths of engines white smoke rises on thin stems into white ghosts of ancient treestogether they rise into ghosts of ancient forestssway and surge and are gone again a million yearsIIThe hot air of the day stays in the city until nightThe long slope of my roof presses the heat down upon meSoon it will rainBut there is no rest in memy heart is wandering too farMy friends may still be in the citybut I do not seek themI go to the animals in the parkWithin their enclosures black shadows of camels lie in the darknessA great white camel broods in the moonlightapart from the restHis lonely eyes are closed and he moves his head slowly from side to side on his long neckswaying in painsearching in a dream for his lost worldI have seen a Norwegian ship carrying its carved head through the waters of a fjord with such a movement Now the high clouds cover the moonOut on the lake a wind assails the layers of heatA white peacock sits in a treealoofelegantincorruptibleA light green spiritAcross the first thunder he lifts his long white laugh at us like a maniacVoidI cannot live long in your cityit has no zones of pain for me where I may restno places where old joys dwell and I may sufferIt is as empty for me as the honeycomb cliff cities of the Southwest For I shall not know love again in this or any placeThe Little Review HANRAHAN S OATH Lady Gregory MARY GILLIS MARGARET ROONEY OWEN HANRAHAN COEY MRSCOEY MICHAEL FEENEY SCENEA wild and rocky placeDoor of stone cabin to

those thoughts athrough your headHANRAHAN Murders and robberies and lust and neglecting the massMARY GILLISAhcome along home with me to the dinner You are fasting this good while back8 The Little Review HANRAHANWhat way can people be thinking of gluttonyand the terrors of the grave before themMARY GILLISCome on now to the little houseand the drop of drink will put such thoughts from your

see who did itHe was brought before no judgeMARY GILLISYou didn t know he was taken and charged and brought to the Tuam AssizesHANRAHANThey could have no proof against himIt was a dark cloudy nightMARY GILLISThat is what they are sayingIt was in no fair way it was made known who did itThe Little Review HANRAHANAh what did he do but put up his fist this way and the gauger was standing where you are supposingand there was a naggin in poor Feeney s handstoops for a stoneand there lit a stroke on himstrikes as if at her It s hard say was it that knocked him or was it the Almighty GodMARY GILLISThere is another thing the people are saying HANRAHANWhat is thatMARY GILLISThey are saying there was another man along with Feeney at the bog stillHANRAHANWhat harm if they are saying thatMARY GILLISIt will be well for that man not to be rambling the countrysidebut to stop here in the shelter of the town where it is not knownIt is likely his name is given out the baronies of Galway and to the merings of County MayoHANRAHANLittleI care they to know I was in itWhat could they lay to my chargeMARY GILLISYou had drink takenYou have no recollection what you said in the spree house in MoniveaIt is the name of an informer you have gained in those districtswhere you gave out the account of Feeney s deedin the hearing of spies or of Government menHANRAHANThat cannot be soAn

of themand they having him in their handAnd it s likely anyway the ship might go down in some stormHANRAHANTo have sent a man to his chastisement through chatteringThat is not of the nature of friendshipThat is surely one of the seven deadly sinsMARY GILLISSure there is nothing standing to you only your share of talkHANRAHANIt is that was my ruinIt would be better for me be born without itthe same as a blessed sheepIt is the sin of the tongue is surely the blackest of allA man that died with drink in himthe missioner was sayingthe soul would sooner stop in torment a thousand years

Little Review 43 TO SUBSCRIBERS Who did not receive their October issue Our October issue has been lying in the Postoffice for the last twenty daysWe did not know this until November 2The issue was mailed on October 18No notice was sent us of any sortso we assumed it had reached subscribers as usualThere was no reason for us to imagine that it had notNo responses came in about the October numberas they usually do within a weekWe inquired of the Postoffice but could get no information except thatall deliveries are likely to be slow these days But complaints of non receipt kept coming inand I went to the PostofficeNovember 2to find out what was the matterI was informed that the issue was being held on account of the short story by Wyndham LewiscalledCantleman s Spring Mate This storyby a distinguished man of lettersa man who at present is in the English army and is fighting in the trenchesis about a young soldierwho has a rustic encounter with a girl inthe offending fires of the spring Also it happens to be a very good piece of prosewhich was our reason for printing itWe had no hope that such a good piece of prose could gain the interest of the Postoffice for a minuteOBSCENITYNovember 9 There is nothing lewd or obscene in that storyIt is a piece of literatureI can t find a word or phrase or sentence in it that anyone could dream of distorting into indecencyThe decision of the Post Office is in our opinion quite absurdly 44 The Little Review wrongWe believe that there have been various complaints of other magazines and that because of those complaintsthe Post Office officials have been aroused to excessive zeal and that we are therefor hit with the otherswrongly and unjustlywe believeWe expect to take matter into CourtThe decision may take a monthWe hope and believe it will be favorable to The Little ReviewWe do not question the motives of the official who acted in this caseWe know our rightsWe are going to defend our rightsWe are sure we will winAbout Newsstand Sales The Little Review is not for sale on all the newsstandsNewsdealers are not particularly interested in displaying a magazine which makes no bids for popularityand
