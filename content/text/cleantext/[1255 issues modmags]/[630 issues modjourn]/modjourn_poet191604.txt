every leaf was lovely with the rain  With wondering eyes I saw how leaf and flower Held up their hands and trembled with delight While on the gleaming bough the alighting bird  Shook its wet wings like something fresh from heaven  And when it sang it told how earth to heaven Was turned and how the miracle of morning Had made of leaf and flower a deathless maiden  To be my mate and teach eternity   She took my hand I understood each thing The leaf says to the flower when both adoring See like themselves leaf shaped and flower painted  The sun descend to bathe in painted shade  She led me out we left the leafy croft And its wet fragrance for the treeless town But she picked up a dead leaf in the mud  And she found flowers in the children s hair  Then she was gone and I am seeking her And every time at evening when it rains And every time at morning when the sun  Bathes in the beauty of that leafy place  Or when he looks into an urchin s eyes To see if April tears or smiles are there And the wet dust scents summer leagues away  I hold my breath the Eternal Maid returns  A BRETON NIGHT  The winter seal is on the door  Three women sit beside the fire Silent and watch their shadows sprawl Like sombre wolfhounds on the floor  One Christus nailed upon the wall Pities the young wife great with child   Whose mate lies drowned beneath the sea She cannot tell how to bear it all  Or live till Noel sets her free  When she need not fear the quick and dead That every nightfall step the stair Awaiting the Nativity  Now she will rise in her despair  To look out through the leaden panes Between the wall bed and the hearth And hear the wind like sea waves there  She does not know how in the earth  The dark blind seed doth hear the wind And think of death and dream of birth As the window sends the firelight forth  SONNETINA PUNCH AND JUDY  This is the play of plays Come boys Old men and little girls and see The rogue outdone in roguery  And hear his lovely dreadful noise  There is a catch in Punch s voice When he escapes the gallows tree That takes the heart outrageously  And makes the rascal street rejoice This is that antic play that made The mummy laugh when he had blood   That shall outlive the tragedy In time of war with sables played The beggar s masque and gamin s mood The first last laugh of comedy  THE WOMAN OF SORROWS  To bed I went for rest no rest there to find Day might sleep nor I midnight waked my mind Oh a heavy wall has sorrow a gloomy hedge has care They kept me close kept me fast held and bound me there  The wind in the keyhole it whimpered bitterly And I got up to open to my crying baby I m not ashamed to cry myself but I m too proud to pray To have the only things I ve left rolled up and put away  That was a babeless woman Helen of Troy She never knew the sorrow and never half the joy I pity the poor women that childing never knew And the nestling of the babe that crying hungry grew  Would you take from my bosom the feeling of my child As soon take the curlew crying from the wild Oh my sorrow for my babe is become my baby The one they have taken the other cannot be  When you see the dog cast for the ewe in the snow When you watch the mother thrush with her nest broke below   Or look in the eyes of the dead that cannot look You may think of my baby and the breast it forsook  NESTA S MORNING SONG  I lived in the shadow The vesper moth mine That hates the green meadow And yellow sunshine The merry sunshine  Like one of the host That fell out of heaven I doubted I lost My angels out driven My archangels seven  O sorrow my raiment And trouble my care You are paid with a payment The Day dawn is there  God s gold in his hair  Now come out of prison And step out of night And greet him new risen My Day of delight  My lovely delight    DEATH AND THE JESTER  Black crow art thou come  For Dagonet s wit  It is quick as the light  Or the dragon fly s dart  It is born in a smile  It is bred in the heart  It is light it is laughter  It took life when Eve laughed  At the lion cub s play  It slept then awhile  When her sorrow came after  With the son of the snake  Eve s joy was my mother  Not Eve s sorrow  And the bird is my brother  That sings as he may  In the close of my day  Lies curl d up the morrow Like the fox in his bed  And my wit if I die  Yet shall wake and shall fly  Take music and live  When Dagonet s dead  Ernest Rhys   UNIVERSITY SKETCHES  THE PROFESSOR MUSES  Physics Lecture Room before Class  I am afraid O Lord I am afraid  These instruments so curiously formed This dynamo and meter that machine Cunning to grasp and hold with delicate hands Your unchained lightnings Lord I am afraid Here in the empty silence of my room  This lecture hall is oddly like a mouth Myself the tongue in it myself the voice Shrill thin across the empty chairs how queer How skeleton like appear these empty chairs Blank walls blank platform ineffectual things And bleak bare windows where the startled day On tiptoe stands too lovely to come in A mouth it seems a maw huge grim slow sure Some day to close and crush me  Lord Lord Lord Am I the thing the daylight falters from Spinning my dusty web of dusty words To catch the plunging star we call the world Hanging it so a period Fool twice fool   Who spider like weave cosmic theories In gossamer nets to trap the universe Spun but to tear a thousand tattered ways And hang on every lilac if a girl A red lipped shallow care free freshman girl Laugh at the sallies of a boy  Afraid Problems of sound and light of light and sound Experiments materials theories The laws of motion problems of sound and light Problems of sound and light   And presently A gong will ring here like a doomsday bell And through these doors like winds that shake the woods Sons of the wind and daughters of the dawn Eternal joyous unafraid comes youth Youth from a million colored realms of joy Youth storming up the world with flying hair And laughter like a rose red deluge spilled Down dawn lit heavens burning all the sea  Problems of light and sound  Why what care they These bright eyed Chloes of our later date For theories of sound themselves the sound Themselves the light that brightens all the day   Round every corner flits a flying foot Alluring laughter shaken fancy free In silver bells that break upon the air Evoe evoe Pan and the nymphs With lips Parted and sparkling eyes the young men follow Follow the swift foot laughter loving nymphs Whose eye lids hold the world Problems of light Problems of light I am sick of light and sound  Youth storming up the world Hot eager youth Youth with a question ever on its lips Impatient of the answer youth with eyes Implacable remorseless passionless Crying I thirst divinely quench my thirst Crying I thirsted and ye helped me not And brushing past me Amperes dynamos Questions of voltage coils transformers watts Shall these things reach them teach them to be wise Temperate noble Surely greater texts Lie in the lips and laughter of young girls Who look at me with pity scarce concealed And curious wonder me the dusty spider Spinning my web in this obdurate room While eager tongues can scarcely pause an hour From ripples of speech  Ah Lord I am afraid For when I think to nave them they elude me   And when I guess it not then have I taught Teach me O Lord and strengthen me Thou knowest I am afraid and weak I am afraid  APHRODITE  I walked among the gray walled buildings The city girdles them And distant clamors Break on the timeless towers as the sea In March Whirls its long lines of sound against the coast  Among them the professors walked Stooping men with glasses And queerly eager feet Some wore Van Dyke beards And on some the hair was silvered They talked very rapidly and all were laden With many books  From hall to solemn hall the hurrying students Streamed in black lines Youths and maidens chatting endlessly Worn women with drawn mouths And dissatisfied men They were seeking something   Aphrodite  Seeking seeking Seeking they knew not what  I too passed with them into a building It was crowded with students And they seemed in the dingy light of the hall Like spectres of dead youth The walls were drab The bulletin boards by the offices And the old chandeliers Looked dusty in the light And I wondered what light did in this place Struggling through the narrow panes The lord of life The eternal sun  Suddenly in the crowded hall I saw her walking toward me The matchless the miraculous The divine Aphrodite And around her the heedless students swarmed And saw her not  Ah Aphrodite Her body in the crowded way like a pillar of light Shone naked and beautiful The silver limbs the lustrous bosom Her face was terrible   Sweet and swift as lightning launched at midnight One arm was raised And from her hand her divine hand She scattered roses Red roses Crisp flakes of kindling fire A murmur of music floated around her Like a sunset colored cloud Her feet moving echoed strangely in my heart Eternal singing The centuries were singing The golden hearted singers of the world Were singing with them Unutterable songs  Thou dead thou deathless goddess Sprung of the wind and the wave and the clean sweet foam The wild songs of the moving feet Choked into silence Ah Aphrodite  The students swarmed again about me Women with drawn mouths Dissatisfied men Seeking something seeking Seeking they knew not what  Howard Mumford Jones    THE WILD HONEY OF WISDOM  To E L L  Better a thousand times is my friend than the nuts of knowledge to me She is wise with the wisdom the flower gives to the honey gathering bee The ways of her mind are free to the winds that circle infinity  My friend is a gardener of joy and her radiant thoughts are seeds That soon or late will be blossoming in the green of their destined meads She has sown in my heart a music that was sighed through moon lit reeds  Frail are her songs from fairydom and so surpassing sweet That in them is the laugh of leaves and the gleam of green shod feet And in and out thread flights of wings with soft and rhythmic beat  She holds a great enchantment in each white lovely hand The days run through her fingers like bright escaping sand And all but grains of loveliness her sanctuary are banned  Her feet so used to wind sweet ways for rest were never meant   The Leader  Tis on a wonder seeking quest their tireless steps are bent Her soul must be a nomad star with all the heavens for bent  THE LEADER  It is but a little thing to see beauty where dream abounds And an easy thing to set sail for the shore in restful seas And who may not be as the note of a song mid tuneful sounds Yea small things these  And hope is a lightsome guest when the mind is arrayed in stars And a pleasant task it is to thank God for a granted prayer And the scales that are builded to weigh but the sun shaft bars Have hands of air  But I even I who am speaking would be as the steadfast pine That clings to a barren rock in the teeth of the whistling wind For everlasting reclothing itself with a new green sign Nor look behind  Arthur V Kent SPRING PIECE  The strayed cherry tree Bewildered by red brick walls In the lost by street Is dusted with green  Its white blossoms push Long and scented fingers Into the liquid air  Clouds of white butterflies Silently drift Like loosened and breathing petals Seeking the sun  THE LINK  When the storm clouds piled between us In the dark and chasmed hour When we struggled for a rebirth of our souls And of our love for one another One thing held me to you  It was not the expanding structures of love That we had builded together It was not vows   Nor inner promises of eternal fealty  Nor our common purposes in life  Nor the clenching grasp of passion  It was the battered little coffee pot  That we had bought together for five cents  From a ghetto push cart  That would not let me go  Clement Wood  SHAKESPEARE  Because the singer of an age he sang The passions of the ages It was humanity itself that sprang To life upon his pages  He told no single being s tale there beat All beings on his pen And when he made a man to walk the street Forth walked a million men  Agnes Lee   THE HORSE THIEF  There he moved cropping the grass at the purple canyon s lip His mane was mixed with the moonlight that silvered his snow white side For the moon sailed out of a cloud with the wake of a spectral ship I crouched and I crawled on my belly my lariat coil looped wide  Dimly and dark the mesas broke on the starry sky A pall covered every color of their gorgeous glory at noon I smelt the yucca and mesquite and stifled my heart s quick cry And wormed and crawled on my belly to where he moved against the moon  Some Moorish barb was that mustang s sire His lines were beyond all wonder From the prick of his ears to the flow of his tail he ached in my throat and eyes Steel and velvet grace As the prophet says God had clothed his neck with thunder Oh marvelous with the drifting cloud he drifted across the skies  And then I was near at hand crouched and balanced and cast the coil   And the moon was smothered in cloud and the rope through my hands with a rip But somehow I gripped and clung with the blood in my brain aboil With a turn round the rugged tree stump there on the purple canyon s lip  Right into the stars he reared aloft his red eye rolling and raging He whirled and sunfished and lashed and rocked the earth to thunder and flame He squealed like a regular devil horse I was haggard and spent and aging Roped clean but almost storming clear his fury too fierce to tame  And I cursed myself for a tenderfoot moon dazzled to play the part But I was doubly desperate then with the posse pulled out from town Or I d never have tried it I only knew I must get a mount and a start The filly had snapped her foreleg short I had had to shoot her down  So there he struggled and strangled and I snubbed him around the tree Nearer a little nearer hoofs planted and lolling tongue   Till a sudden slack pitched me backward He reared right on top of me Mother of God that moment He missed me and up I swung  Somehow gone daft completely and clawing a bunch of his mane As he stumbled and tripped in the lariat there I was up and astride And cursing for seven counties And the mustang Just insane  Crack bang went the rope we cannoned off the tree then gods that ride  A rocket that s all a rocket I dug with my teeth and nails Why we never hit even the high spots though I hardly remember things But I heard a monstrous booming like a thunder of flapping sails When he spread well call me a liar when he spread those wings those wings  So white that my eyes were blinded thick feathered and wide unfurled They beat the air into billows We sailed and the earth was gone Canyon and desert and mesa withered below with the world And then I knew that mustang for I was Bellerophon   Yes glad as the Greek and mounted on a horse of the elder gods With never a magic bridle or a fountain mirror nigh My chaps and spurs and holster must have looked it What s the odds I d a leg over lightning and thunder careering across the sky  And forever streaming before me fanning my forehead cool Flowed a mane of molten silver and just before my thighs As I gripped his velvet muscled ribs while I cursed myself for a fool The steady pulse of those pinions their wonderful fall and rise  The bandanna I bought in Bowie blew loose and whipped from my neck My shirt was stuck to my shoulders and ribboning out behind The stars were dancing wheeling and glancing dipping with smirk and beck The clouds were flowing dusking and glowing We rode a roaring wind  We soared through the silver starlight to knock at the planets gates New shimmering constellations came whirling into our ken Red stars and green and golden swung out of the void that waits   For man s great last adventure the Signs took shape and then  I knew the lines of that Centaur the moment I saw him come The musical box of the heavens all around us rolled to a tune That tinkled and chimed and trilled with silver sounds that struck you dumb As if some archangel were grinding out the music of the moon  Melody drunk on the Milky Way as we swept and soared hilarious Full in our pathway sudden he stood the Centaur of the  Stars Flashing from head and hoofs and breast I knew him for Sagittarius He reared and bent and drew his bow He crouched as a boxer spars  Flung back on his haunches weird he loomed then leapt and the dim void lightened Old White Wings shied and swerved aside and fled from the splendor shod Through a flashing welter of worlds we charged I knew why my horse was frightened He had two faces a dog s and a man s that Babylonian god   Also he followed us real as fear Ping went an arrow past My broncho buck jumped humping high We plunged I guess that s all I lay on the purple canyon s lip when I opened my eyes at last Stiff and sore and my head like a drum but I broke no bones in the fall  So you know and now you may string me up Such was the way you caught me Thank you for letting me tell it straight though you never could greatly care For I took a horse that wasn t mine But there s one the heavens brought me And I ll hang right happy because I know he is waiting for me up there  From creamy muzzle to cannon bone by God he s a peerless wonder He is steel and velvet and furnace fire and death s suprem est prize And never again shall be roped on earth that neck that is clothed with thunder   String me up Dave Go dig my grave I rode him across the skies William Rose BenÃªt   CROSS PATCH  Her ardent spirit ran beyond her years As light before a flame At fifteen the tennis medal at sixteen the golf cup Then the coveted bluest of blue ribbons For faultless horsemanship No man in all that country Whatever his sport But had to own the girl a better man As that she merely laughed saying that triumph Is all a matter of thrill who tingles most He wins inevitably Half bewilderment half jest They called her Sprite those ordinary folk Who thought such urge such instinct of life to joy Was somehow mythical And having named her they no longer thought of her To their relief as young or old one sex or other Just herself apart a goddess of out of doors School boys never dreamed of her tenderly As one to send a perfumed valentine But when she strode among the horses in the field They pawed the ground No leash could hold a dog when she passed by  Then despite her ardent race with time Ardent as though each moment were a dare   To some adventure of freed muscle and thrilled nerve A fleeter runner overtook her flight And bound her tightly in a golden net Hands feet and bosom lips and hair and eyes Beauty beauty of women Or was it she unconscious what she raced Ran suddenly breathless glad and yet dismayed Into the arms of her own womanhood Which no one knew herself the least of all But no more did she fly beyond herself As eager to leave the very flesh behind But stayed with it in deep and rapturous content Her ardor turned Henceforth within upon a secret goal Spirit and beauty seemed to flow together Each rapt in each Like a hushed lily in a hidden pool Only at dances did the sprite peep out Ardent and yet controlled Alive to every turn and slope of the rhythm As if the music spread a path for her To what she truly sought  Twas at a dance she found it found the man And no one had to question what she found Her eyes her very finger tips proclaimed The marvel it was to be a part of her A part of love   The man he had no medals and ribbons of triumph If she had fled on horse or even on foot He never could have caught her It must have been his mind s humility That made her stay So thoughtless of itself so thoughtful of Forgotten wisdoms old greatness world riddles A patient slow but never yielding search Passionate too with wings flight of its own For what compared with other minds she knew Might well have seemed the blessed western isles They lived beyond the village on a hill Beneath a row of pines a house without pretense Yet fully conscious of uncommon worth A house all books inside  Their only neighbor was a garrulous man Who smoked a never finished pipe Upon a never finished woodpile Strategically placed beside the road So none could pass without his toll of gossip He started it One day pointing his thumb across the pines he said There s something wrong up yonder Their honeymoon has set behind a storm I heard em fight last night Well what d he expect They re all alike women Of course it got about   And while no one quite believed Still to make sure some friendly women called They said that he was studying quite as usual Not changed at all just quiet and indrawn The last man in the world to make a quarrel And she well of course she wasn t so easy to read Always strange and different from a child But even in her the sharpest eye saw nothing That seemed the loose end of the littlest quarrel No couple could have acted more at ease And anyhow a woman like that they said Would never have stayed so quiet in the pines With unhappiness but tossed it from her broadcast Like brands from a bonfire She said the house was damp and that was all At last even the old garrulous woodpile Knocked out the ashes of it from his pipe  But then a few months later a frightened servant girl Ran at early morning from the pines Crying the judge in town She said her mistress suddenly without cause Standing by her in the kitchen turned on her Blackly with words no decent girl deserved Then struck her full in the face spat on her pulled her hair She wanted compensation the servant did And a clean character before the world Yes and punishment for the beast who hurt her   That is if the woman wasn t mad Mad oh ho the shock of it Rolled seething over the place like a tidal wave And in the wake of the wave like weed and wreckage Many a hint and sense of something wrong at the pines Sprawled in the daylight A stable boy remembered How not a week before she d called for a horse The spiritedest saddle they had And when she brought him back twas late at night The horse and woman both done up Slashed splashed and dripping But all she said was Send the bill The beast s no good I ll never ride again  So this and other stories quite as strange Stretched everybody s nerves for the trial to come And made them furious when it didn t come He settling with the girl outside of court The judge s wife knew all there was to know Not jealousy at all just nerves Every woman you know at certain times Of course agreed the village so that s it still  Not to be cheated outright still Even so she d best take care of that temper A husband s one thing an unborn child s another She d always been a stormy uncontrollable soul Some blamed the husband he had never reined her in   Most pitied him a task impossible All waited the event on tiptoe It wasn t like other women somehow for her to have a chi  The months passed no child was born Then other women sneered openly She wanted one and couldn t served her right This lapse from the common law of wives Was all the fissure the sea required To force the dike with Little by little then The pressure of year on year The pines and the two lives they hid Grew dubious then disagreeable then at last sinister At this point the new generation took up Its inheritance the habit of myth And quite as a matter of course it found her hateful Ugly a symbol of sudden fear by darkened paths Cross Patch  And one by one the people who were young Beside her youth moved off or died or changed Forgetting her youth as they forgot their own Until if ever she herself Had felt a sudden overwhelming pang To stop some old acquaintance on the road And stammer out You know don t you the girl I was I was not always this was I she might have found A dozen at most to know the Sprite her youth But none to clear the overtangled path   That led from Sprite to Cross Patch not one not one But looking back would damn The very urge of joy in Sprite and all its ardent spirit For having mothered Cross Patch not one not one To see the baffled womanhood she was Orphan of hopes too bright not mother of evil And thus besieged on all sides by the present She fought against all sides as if by fury To force one way to yield  For both it was a nightmare not a life and neither Could well have told how it had ever begun But once begun it seemed inevitable A storm that settled darkly round their souls Unwilled as winter With moan of wind through sere and barren boughs And skies forever masked The first blow of the quarrel had been hers A blow unguessed by either for she struck Like nature not to hurt but to survive But wrath accrued So soon thereafter that the blow seemed angry And she struck out again with eyes and tongue Pursuing him the angrier at his grief Until in sheer defense he hit Not at herself but at her blows to ward them Keeping the while His thought above the dark upon a star or so   Fixed in the past But she defended her wrath As part of her dignity and right they stormed Up up the hill and down Increasing darkness to the end of life Of him friends said He seemed like a lonely sentinel Posted against the very edge of doom Whom no watch came relieving She ll kill him yet the fool the woodpile s verdict Before the pipe went out for the last time Leaving the pines unneighbored  But he was wrong the urn outlasted the flame One night hands at her throat she came And knelt before him timidly reaching out And trying to speak to speak struggling as if words Were something still to learn At last speech broke from her so agonized He hardly knew if it were supreme wrath or supreme sup  plication You did not love me And as he bent to her he felt Her girlhood cry a murdered thing returned He hoped that it was wrath as easier to endure Feeling it burn from mind to heart from heart to soul Gathering more awe more terror at each advance Like a priest with sacrifice it passed The colonnades of his thought entering without pause   An unknown altar of his being Behind a curtain never moved before You did not love me Both gazed upon the sacrifice held up As though it were the bleeding heart of their own lives Somehow no longer their own  And then the priest returned slowly pace by pace Out of the hush of feeling into the hush of thought It was the priest and not himself the man believed Who like an echo not less agonized Whispered across the waste of many lives Whispering No   Whose heart the man s or woman s lowest stooped To raise the other prostrate heart aloft With supplication and consolement urging it To live oh live dying itself the while God knew before the beginning of the world We only know that stooping so dust turned to dust All hearts meet at last  Horace Holley  EDITORIAL COMMENT  SHAKESPEARE  HA T manner of man was this who peopled a  provincial stage made music of a barbarous  tongue played a few parts dreamed many  dreams set up an estate in his native village  and died in his prime three hundred years ago this month What manner of man was it whose name during these three centuries has been rung on all the bells of fame whose people are the friends of all the world whose thinking washes under all our cargoes and whose rhythms are the waves on which our visions ride Everywhere he is present we cannot escape him he passes current like the coin of the realm He is part of our language of the phrasing and movement and beat of it and when we are silent the very winds and stars march to his music What manner of man was this who has become so much more important to the world than he ever was to himself  Of course there is only one word that a man can write with whatever expenditure of ink the word myself Shakespeare has been called impersonal but he could no more escape this word than the clamorous egotist who shouts I I I on every page If he hides behind his characters he is nevertheless there and the search for his evasive personality is the central and secret fascination of his work Some writers are easy to find in the books they leave us and   when found they may be no great matter others reveal themselves only to their friends and reward them with special intimacy others pause for a beautiful gesture a smile almost a touch and are off again always alluring and eluding But this poet who giving himself away in thirty seven plays and an hundred and fifty four sonnets was yet the most reserved of men this poet is the most magnetic of all The things we discover of him that sympathy and insight that humor and shrewdness that love of all life and passion for all beauty that poignant tenderness at the edge of a grave that strange worldliness and baffling indifference to his art these are but the beginning of his self His secret is always deeper within further beyond The more we get those of us who get beneath the surface at all  the more awaits us  Because this poet does not wear his heart on his sleeve or explain himself to the passer by and because a certain type of mind delights in puzzles and cryptograms and facile interpretations we have had a thousand misreadings of his character and even huge and elaborate Baconian theories to rob us of our Shakespeare and substitute for that large figure something small and definite and precise The myriadminded we are told must have been a soldier to reveal war a lawyer to understand law a courtier to present princes and of late Mr Frank Harris has soberly asserted that he must have been a madman to compass the madness of Lear What are these foolish commentators doing but exposing their own folly The colossus stands there unshaken smil   ing his enigmatic solemn smile with that same look of pity and tenderness in his eyes  It takes a poet to interpret a poet Holbein might have painted Shakespeare if he had lived long enough or Durer might have made a copperplate of him as mysterious as the MelancolÃ­a But no meaner imagination can quite compass that soul adrift between hell and heaven devoured by earthly desires and divine despairs writing immortal plays as a kind of lucrative by play a sop and solace to his tyrannous imagination which clamored for freedom in worlds greater than his own Now and then during these three centuries someone has cast a flash light on this figure but no one has yet revealed all the pride and power of it all the sorrow and weakness Even Mr Edwin Arlington Robinson in his illuminating monologue Ben Jonson Entertains a Man from Stratford though he gets nearer to the heart of his subject than any of the thousand and one critics and panegyrists before him even he does not strip that spirit bare  Shakespeare himself makes confession of course in the sonnets besides his less deliberate confession in the plays The sonnets present his supreme experiences exquisite emotion love exalting or degrading conviction of sin conviction of fame the sense of unendurable beauty the magnanimity of unalterable love the blight of decay and death the glory of spiritual life And through the poem runs the theme of Hamlet that sense of inadequacy for life which must haunt the artist the man of thought and imagination self   torture over doing always the wrong thing while seeing the right self disgust that his lady s other lovers can outplay him that any fool can seize the moment for action better than he  Perhaps nowhere else in English personal poetry does one feel so sure of the poet s absolute uncompromising sincerity In Shakespeare s sonnets a wide range of human experience is transmuted into the subtlest music ever wrought out of English words and so for one who knows and loves them they reach the heart of any mood like a dear friend s voice Seek them as a relief from petty cares and they soothe like running waters go to them in grief and they are elegies in joy and they chime like bells in triumph and they sing paeans Remorse despair pity love worship the most diverse emotions all find their answer here It is as though the poem had been sung for the special mood we bring to it so intimately so healingly does it touch each wound and fill the chambers of the soul with beauty  The sonnets record a period of passionate experience in a life whose serenity is elsewhere its strongest note They are the forty days of struggle in the wilderness and they bring not bitterness or violence but surer vision and deeper sympathy They lead from the comedies to the tragedies from Much Ado About Nothing to Macbeth and King Lear  It is my feeling that from the time of the sonnets to his death about fifteen years the poet steeled himself against devastating emotional excitement and took refuge in his imagination One thing seemed about as important as an   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  other in the actual world he felt something of that illumined apathy which Browning ascribes to the resurrected Lazarus The people around him became part of the dream gaining color and significance but losing substantiality Gradually his serenity regained its poise we have the proof of this in The Tempest and we should have had more in that unwritten greatest play of all had he lived to grow old in Stratford  One of Shakespeare s love lyrics perhaps the most magical has long seemed to me expressive of a larger meaning Let us listen to its haunting music  Take oh take those lips away  That so sweetly were forsworn  And those eyes the break of day  Lights that do mislead the morn  But my kisses bring again  Bring again  Seals of love but sealed in vain  Sealed in vain  I do not know what lady first heard that madrigal To inspire it was worth a life of care and we may well hope that this high service to the world may have shortened the purgatorial pains she had to suffer for her perfidy But perhaps we should think of her as a symbol of something less tangible a symbol of life itself Surely it was thus that Shakespeare knew and loved his world Tantalizing mistress what vow could bind her to his soul forever Elusive and unconquerable her trustful eyes could turn from him her smile could pass to another before it had time to fade her oaths were broken even in the uttering Royal and bountiful she is   beautiful and strong hut unremembering and insecure For a time her treasures crown him and all her raptures fall about his soul But even in the moment of ecstasy he knows the vanity of their sensuous joys Then above all he feels the infinite summons The world and its accepted values fade off into nothingness time loses its brief space in the eternal years knowledge is drawn up like a curtain before the unfathomable mystery and all our human pride becomes the shadow of a dream Before that inescapable vision that are life and song and fame Bubbles to be blown for a toy to rise and gleam and vanish and be thought of no more And so deeper than his love of life was his indifference to it wider than his knowledge of the world was his recklessness of its applause Flowers or ashes he cared not kisses or broken vows he could live and love for either Thus in his personality there is something selfless and inscrutable which from age to age has fascinated the world We feel him vast impartial beneficent like light and air We return to the old simile and liken him to the ocean for universality and strength and poise And we feel in his presence as before these natural forces that he tells not all he gives not all We take from him Hamlet Lear The Tempest unsatisfied wondering what he could have done if he had ever put forth his utmost power We diagram his greatness we explain it in terms of earth and in terms of heaven We theorize and define and dream but the heart of his mystery still eludes us We are baffled by his impenetrability and we cast him from our hearts into the outer darkness of in   tellectual admiration and clasp once more the familiar idols those lesser heroes whose limitations make them kin to us And he knows that we are faithless that we take him for what he is not that our hearts are cold to him He had foreseen it all that fame is but a breath that immortality is but light across a grave He was not deceived and his love can never change with the altering of ours For the centre of his soul as of all great souls is love Still out of the deeps of time his voice seems calling to the approaching years  Take oh take those lips away That so sweetly were forsworn And those eyes the break of day Lights that do mislead the morn But my kisses bring again Bring again Seals of love but sealed in vain Sealed in vain  H M  STATUS RERUM THE SECOND  It is over three years since

verse were at that time deemed by our editor either impolite or imprudent My opinion of the work of nearly all the older living American poets save Bliss Carman has no whit changed to them and to their generation of editors we owe nothing which would look polite in print Perhaps I may   now be permitted to say this because it may be a sort of surety for my candor seeing that I am about to present a more pleasing schedule  During three years of varying irritation and consolation I have seen POETRY print a certain amount of rubbish and a very considerable amount of the best work now done in English I do not think that our editors have missed much that was really worth printing I dare say there is not enough really good poetry actually written per month to fill completely all the space in this magazine  It has published the best current work of Mr Yeats and of Ford Madox Hueffer the only two older poets whose writing has any lively significance It has published Padraic Colum Allen Upward H D T S Eliot Aldington at his best Orrick Johns Frost Carlos Williams Bodenheim Sandburg myself Rodker etc  The St Louis Mirror scored in getting the Spoon River Anthology that is the one big hole in our record and POETRY was not slow to recognize the merit of that work The best English work that we have missed has been a few short poems by Harold Monro and a few by Mrs Anna Wickham  Imagism before it went off into froth and before stray editors used to write to me to complain that their mail was full of imitations of imagism vorticism vers libre etc with no body to it the early imagism had its first breath of air in these pages At present its chief defects are sloppi ness lack of cohesion lack of organic centre in individual   poems rhetoric a conventional form of language to be found also in classical text books and in some cases a tendency more than slight towards the futurist s cinematographic fluidity  However coming at the noble art from the angle of nationalism or chauvinism dividing the produce geographically one finds some ground or at least some excuse for congratulating ourselves or our country  Looking at the names of English writers in my first Status Rerum I find that not one of them has bettered his position one iota Only Mr Yeats and Mr Hueffer have done work worthy of notice The rest have either stagnated or relapsed completely into silence  As for the younger generation in 1912 America had very little wherewith to challenge comparison with England or France At the present writing one can select an all America team of les jeunes to compete with les jeunes of either France or England or any other nation  I am not buttering anyone One usually refrains from complimenting young poets for it may be thought that compliments tend to make them sit down and contemplate their own beauties which is not one s intention I am simply cataloguing cold facts I do not know Mr Masters age but his work is of our decade its relations are with our decade and not with the decade preceding and if we are judging the output of the last three years we must count it in  With regard to the best work done in these three years we may as well recognize that a certain part of it is American   Eliot Frost and H D are Americans so also are Williams Sandburg Bodenheim Orrick Johns John Gould Fletcher etc  Against a team made up of these writers you can place in England Aldington Monro Rodker Flint Lawrence Mrs Wickham Douglas Goldring and we suffer in no degree by the comparison If Fletcher occasionally goes off in rhetorical bombast it is at least better than Mr Aber crombie s bombast And Lindsay is more alive than his numerous English confrÃ¨res As for the sickly multitude pouring out mediocre and sub mediocre work in both countries in the first place they don t count and in the second place if any among them do turn out a good scrap of work these scraps neutralize  Even France and France has not been at war all three years even France will not leave us hopelessly in the rear We may estimate the weight of her younger generation at more or less that of Jules Romains Charles Vildrac M Jouve and MM Klingsor Jacob Appollonaire etc Recognizing most emphatically that America of the former generation can in no way compete with the mass of De Regnier De Gourmont Francis Jammes Tailhade et leurs amis  The rest of the current French work is full of loose Hugoesque rhetoric sociology mucked mysticism for the multitude aqueous bombast and all the fluid and ubiquitous diseases I don t mean to say there is none good but one s impression of fifty odd books of their verse is that they need a deal of sorting a deal of excerpting and compression   I don t know whether one is to lump the Irish poets into an all empire team or to judge them by themselves James Joyce by far the most significant writer of our decade is confining himself to prose or to be meticulously exact he has written a few brief poems which POETRY will soon publish I do not know that one can say anything of either Colum or Campbell that one would not have said three years ago  I shall not indulge in hopes or prophesyings Certain young American writers have appeared I can hardly be accused of undue prejudice in favor of my native country in stating the fact of their appearance But I do not wish to focus attention on what has been done it is better to keep an eye on what still awaits doing  Others with its pages open to any hair breadth experiment is deserving of welcome We can scarcely be too ready to inspect new ventures and it is a pleasing contrast to the stuffiness of some of our ancestral publications which still reek of eighteen fifty Mr Kreymborg its editor has published Eliot Cannell Williams himself Carlton Brown etc Moreover certain purely commercial and popular magazines have lifted an eyelid H L Mencken has more or less discovered John McClure Wattles and John Sanborn  Orrick Johns writes me most vigorously of the genius of a dramatist Sadakichi Hartman But print put Rabelais through a bath of perfume and serve in cigarette holders at a boudoir spree   I have not seen enough of the work of most of these writers to form any sort of judgment but it seems to me that they have among them a sense of activity which was lacking in New York when I passed that way five years ago At any rate the country looks less like a blasted wilderness than it did a few years since and for that let us be duly thankful and let us hope it is not a straw blaze  Ezra Pound  REVIEWS  MR MASEFIELD S NEW BOOK  Good Friday and Other Poems by John Masefield Mac  millan  The title poem of this volume a drama of the Crucifixion is less interesting than the sonnets which follow it Here the poet like many a sonneteer before him presents his philosophy of life describes his despairing pursuit of Beauty who is within all Nature everywhere and who yet eludes capture and gives her votary only  One hour or two or three in long years scattered  No summer butterfly is this brooding spirit of Beauty but the secret music at the heart of creation the sublime harmony which the poet overhears in those few divine moments and to which forever after he would tune his life and his lyre  For these so many years of useless toil Despair endeavor and again despair   Sweat that the base machine may have its oil Idle delight to tempt one everywhere A life upon the cross To make amends Three flaming memories that the death bed ends  The undertone of these sonnets is profound sadness Having lost the God whom he was taught in youth the poet faces almost with agony the perishing loveliness of the flesh the earth the sidereal universe of all things visible or imagined and lives on under sword like flashes of a light too glorious and terrible to be endured  What am I Life A thing of watery salt Held in cohesion by unresting cells Which work they know not why which never halt Myself unwitting where their Master dwells I do not bid them yet they toil they spin A world which uses me as I use them Nor do I know which end or which begin Nor which to praise which pamper which condemn So like a marvel in a marvel set I answer to the vast as wave by wave The sea of air goes over dry or wet Or the full moon comes swimming from her cave Or the great sun comes forth this myriad I Tingles not knowing how yet wondering why  Beside the passionate self revelation of these sonnets much of this poet s earlier work becomes stage drapery or melodrama For Mr Masefield as we have said before is stronger as a reflective and descriptive poet than as a playwright or a novelist in verse In such sonnets as These myriad days There on the darkened deathbed So in the empty sky It may be so with us There is no God The little robin When all these million cells in these and others we find a poignant sincerity and simplicity in the expression of   a modern attitude toward life of a feeling enforced by modern science in millions of hearts  The short one act play Good Friday is comparatively artificial The poet presents the drama of the Crucifixion from afar off through its reaction upon Pilate his wife Procula the centurion Longinus Herod the Jewish crowd and a madman who like most stage lunatics is saner than the worldly wise We watch the approach and consummation of the sublime event as through a veil darkly noting only a kind of dim processional The play has movement and a certain decorative quality but as in a procession the people are conventional characters rather than individuals  There is a dangerous allure in this subject but the poet who touches it faces a formidable rival The intense vitality of the gospels which has survived nearly two millennia makes any modern assault seem weak In the bible story each personage of the great drama stands out as a living passionate human being In Mr Masefield s version they all seem to mouth their speeches and gesticulate like stage figures Pilate suffers the most for he loses his time honored taciturnity and becomes a man of words And the Madman is as conventional as the others saying only the expected thing The play has a certain dignity and at times beauty both reaching a climax in the centurion s description of the Crucifixion  But the sonnets are the thing H M   A PIONEER  The Man against the Sky by Edwin Arlington Robinson  Macmillan  Certain zealous admirers of Mr Robinson insist that he was the beginning of the new movement In the stern stript austerities of Captain Craig published in 1902 they find the heredity of Robert Frost Edgar Lee Masters and other poets of modern life In a certain sense this may be true even though Mr Masters at least never read a line of Robinson until a year after Spoon River was written Before the heavily scented nineties were over Mr Robinson was writing in a grave bare style simple and direct poems about his neighbors and since then in The Children of the Night and The Town Down the River he has gone his own way among them with complete independence If he does not move us so deeply as the other two poets if his work  is less rich his revelation of life less complete this may be because of a slower colder temperament We do not feel him so much in the midst of things He seems to stand aloof like a scientist analyzing each human being curiously as a specimen Perhaps as Anders Zorn once said of a certain painter He does not love enough  But in my opinion Mr Robinson has never done better work than in this lastest volume Flammonde is a portrait as deftly drawn as Minever Cheevy and more subtle in its type that of a whimsically blighted nobility The Gift of God presents the almost grotesque exaltation of motherhood John   Gorham is a complete little tragedy of disillusionment and  in such poems as Old Trails and Llewellyn and the Tree  we observe certain odd and unexpected tricks by which fate  keeps a relentless control over human lives Only in the  final and titular poem does the poet seem to reflect about life  in his own person putting a bitter question to his soul in  such lines as these  If after all that we have lived and thought All comes to Naught If there be nothing after Now And we be nothing anyhow And we know that why live  And he finds no more quieting answer to the question than  a dim perception of something too permanent for dreams  But this we know if we know anything That we may laugh and fight and sing And of our transience here make offering To an orient Word that will not be erased Or save in incommunicable gleams Too permanent for dreams Be found or known  The portrait of Shakespeare is a masterpiece Everyone has written about Shakespeare but no one so far as I can remember has got beneath his skin with such devilish ingenuity and angelic divination as Mr Robinson when as he puts it in the title Ben Jonson Entertains a Man from Stratford The poet cleverly shifts all responsibility by making Rare Ben do the talking and Ben with a neighbor s frankness a friend s humorous affection and a fellow poet s admiration tells what seems the truth about that enigmatic figure as no one has ever told it before I cannot quote from   the poem it is too compact Go read it in this tercentenary month  Perhaps we may more fitly quote from Cassandra in which the poet turns his flash light upon a whole nation and sketches the American visage in sharp and stinging lines  Because a few complacent years Have made your peril of your pride Think you that you are to go on Forever pampered and untried  What lost eclipse of history What bivouac of the marching stars Have given the sign for you to see Millenniums and last great wars  Your Dollar Dove and Eagle make A Trinity that even you Rate higher than you rate yourselves It pays it flatters and it s new  The power is yours but not the sight You see not upon what you tread You have the ages for your guide But not the wisdom to be led  Think you to tread forever down The merciless old verities And are you never to have eyes To see the world for what it is  Are you to pay for what you have With all you are No other word We caught but with a laughing crowd Moved on None heeded and few heard  H M   MR ALDINGTON S IMAGES  Images Old and New by Richard Aldington Four Seas Co  Boston  One of the highest pleasures that the intelligent and discriminating reader of poetry can have is to discover some poet who employs throughout his work a clean and sure technique There have been few such poets in English but in France Italy and wherever the classic spirit has shown itself strongly we can discover many examples to prove the crudity of our usual slap dash Anglo Saxon methods Recently there have been in England signs of a return to that simplicity and restraint which are the qualities of highest art and it is to be hoped that the war will have the effect of still further clarifying the English spirit over muddied with floods of Victorian sentiment and rhetoric Of this admirable tendency Mr Aldington is the precursor and the most shining example  The impression one gains from the reading of the thirty five pieces which he has now gathered together and given to the public is one of uniform technical excellence Here is a style like a sword blade bright keen nervous and never exuberant Nowhere does the poet say too much nowhere does he permit his image to become clouded with long accumulations of detail vague sentiments or indefinite moral izings In fact it may be that he sometimes says too little for those who seek to read as they run or for those who are too readily inclined to look for that heroic strumming and smashing which is vulgarly considered to be the chief char   acteristic of major poetry But it is necessary to point out that this common view of poetry is not that of the great artists whether they be Greeks Chinese Japanese or Johann Wolfgang von Goethe In restraint the master first displays himself By such standards Mr Aldington must be judged and he is neither major nor minor but simply a poet  These Images Old and New as he calls them divide themselves roughly into two classes the first dealing with Greek antiquity the second with modern life In either case whatever be the subject the unity is preserved and it is a unity of style of attitude Mr Aldington is a poet who speaks the truth He is never vaguely romantic or sentimental or writing to satisfy anything but his own artistic conscience There is scarcely a page in this small volume in which we cannot find something that will satisfy us at the first reading and yet more fully with successive readings but there are some pages which will begin by shocking us and end by convincing us Here is a force which attracts us the more completely for its apparent simplicity and it is the force not of realism but of reality  It is very difficult among so much that is good to select for quotation a single poem and to set it apart from the indissoluble unity of the book that contains it Here however is a brief example which I pick because it is among the less frequently quoted poems  The cripples are going to church Their crutches beat upon the stones And they have clumsy iron boots   Mr Aldington s Images  Their clothes are black their faces peaked and mean Their legs are withered Like dried bean pods Their eyes are stupid as frogs  And the god September Has paused for a moment here Garlanded with crimson leaves He held a branch of pointed oak He smiled like Hermes the beautiful  Cut in marble  There we have it all a sense of the sordidness of existence of the wayward and casual beauty with which nature decks that sordidness irony and pity concealed yet poignant and I know not what feeling of nostalgia and transience that arises somehow from all these Mr Aldington is a poet as Simonides and Turgenev were poets  We in America at least have much to learn from him The inchoate vastness of our material and of its intertangled racial currents the haphazardness of our methods and institutions all tend to drive us towards a poetry which is ephemeral in that it is hectic disorganized lacking in reflective judgment Europe has already taught us to distinguish the vital elements in the work of such men as Whitman and Poe from the unvital Europe can teach us more There are at least a dozen poets in this country who could not do better than to keep a copy of Images Old and New on their shelves for constant reference and comparison  John Gould Fletcher   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  I Poetry is not only an art it is becoming almost an activity The Drama League of America has prepared for distribution a long list of Available Material for Shakespeare Tercentennial Programs for the use of schools clubs etc through this spring and summer of the anniversary year These programs consist of folk dances music and a variety of masques and pageants Among these latter are fairy masques for children elaborated from scenes in the plays and the most important program is Mr Percy Mackaye s Caliban which is to be acted through the season by a touring company II  The city of Newark New Jersey has offered thirteen prizes beginning with a first prize of 250 and amounting to 1 000 in all for poems celebrating the city and its history in honor of its two hundred and fiftieth anniversary The poems must not be over one thousand words long and they must be submitted anonymously before April tenth to a committee consisting of Prof John C Van Dyke Mr Thomas L Masson Miss Theodosia Garrison and certain officials and teachers of Newark  We would humbly suggest that the committee should be composed entirely of poets following the example of such contests in painting sculpture and architecture   III  Under the inspiration of lectures by Miss Katharine Howard author of Eve and other books of verse the Poetry Society of Utah has been established in Salt Lake City under the presidency of Miss Myra Sawyer Similar societies should be founded in many cities In every such group would probably be found at least one member with a musical voice and a feeling for rhythm who could read aloud the best modern poetry without turning it into broken prose Extreme simplicity should be the aim of such a reader no elocutionary effects The production of verse among the members and ruthless criticism of it might well be encouraged also as an aid to appreciation or a stimulus to possible talent  NOTES  Of the two English poets represented this month one Mr Ernest Rhys has appeared before in the magazine Long a prominent member of Welsh and Celtic
