OCTOBER 1915  DAYS  SKETCH  THE shadows of the ships Rock on the crest In the low blue lustre Of the tardy and the soft inrolling tide  A long brown bar at the dip of the sky Puts an arm of sand in the span of salt  The lucid and endless wrinkles Draw in lapse and withdraw Wavelets crumble and white spent bubbles Wash on the floor of the beach  Rocking on the crest In the low blue lustre Are the shadows of the ships   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NOCTURNE IN A DESERTED BRICKYARD  Stuff of the moon Runs on the lapping sand Out to the longest shadows Under the curving willows And round the creep of the wave line Fluxions of yellow and dusk on the waters Make a wide dreaming pansy of an old pond in the night  ALONE  Naked I stood on the soft shingle of sand where the sea swept my legs with salt and wet Alone I walked under the arch of night where stars fluttered between treetops in the wind And a long memory it is I have how the sea and the night were kind  MONOTONE  The monotone of the rain is beautiful And the sudden rise and slow relapse Of the long multitudinous rain  The sun on the hills is beautiful Or a captured sunset sea flung Bannered with fire and gold   Monotone  A face I know is beautiful With fire and gold of sky and sea And the peace of long warm rain  UNDER THE HARVEST MOON  Under the harvest moon When the soft silver Drips shimmering Over the garden nights Death the gray mocker Comes and whispers to you As a beautiful friend Who remembers  Under the summer roses When the flagrant crimson Lurks in the dusk Of the wild red leaves Love with little hands Comes and touches you With a thousand memories And asks you Beautiful unanswerable questions   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  JOY  Let a joy keep you Reach out your hands And take it when it runs by As the Apache dancer Clutches his woman I have seen them Live long and laugh loud Sent on singing singing Smashed to the heart Under the ribs With a terrible love Joy always Joy everywhere Let joy kill you Keep away from the little deaths  THE GREAT HUNT  I can not tell you now When the wind s drive and whirl Blow me along no longer And the wind s a whisper at last  Maybe I ll tell you then some other time  When the rose s flash to the sunset Reels to the wrack and the twist   The Great Hunt  And the rose is a red bygone When the face I love is going And the gate to the end shall clang And it s no use to beckon or say So long  Maybe I ll tell you then some other time  I never knew any more beautiful than you I have hunted you under my thoughts I have broken down under the wind And into the roses looking for you  I shall never find any greater than you  DAYS  I will keep you and bring hands to hold you against a  great hunger 1 will run a spear in you for a great gladness to die with I will stab you between the ribs of the left side with a great  love worth remembering  HANDFULS  Blossoms of babies Blinking their stories  Come soft  On the dusk and the babble   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Little red gamblers Handfuls that slept in the dust  Summers of rain Winters of drift Tell off the years And they go back Who came soft Back to the sod To silence and dust Gray gamblers  Handfuls again  THEY WILL SAY  Of my city the worst that men will ever say is this You took little children away from the sun and the dew And the glimmers that played in the grass under the great sky And the reckless rain you put them between walls To work broken and smothered for bread and wages To eat dust in their throats and die empty hearted For a little handful of pay on a few Saturday nights  A FENCE  Now the stone house on the lake front is finished and the workmen are beginning the fence The palings are made of iron bars with steel points that can stab the life out of any man who falls on them   A Fence  As a fence it is a masterpiece and will shut off the rabble and all vagabonds and hungry men and all wandering children looking for a place to play  Passing through the bars and over the steel points will go nothing except Death and the Rain and To morrow  TH E POOR  Among the mountains I wandered and saw blue haze and red crag and was amazed On the beach where the long push under the endless tide maneuvers I stool silent Under the stars on the prairie watching the Dipper slant over the horizon s grass I was full of thoughts  Great men pageants of war and labor soldiers and workers mothers lifting their children these all I touched and felt the solemn thrill of them  And then one day I got a true look at the Poor millions of the Poor patient and toiling more patient than crags tides and stars innumerable patient as the darkness of night and all broken humble ruins of nations  KILLERS  I am singing to you Soft as a man with a dead child speaks Hard as a man in handcuffs Held where he can not move   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Under the sun Are sixteen million men Chosen for shining teeth Sharp eyes hard legs And a running of young warm blood in their wrists  And a red juice runs on the green grass And a red juice soaks the dark soil And the sixteen million are killing and killing  and killing  I never forget them day or night They beat on my head for memory of them They pound on my heart and I cry back to them To their homes and women dreams and games  I wake in the night and smell the trenches And hear the low stir of sleepers in lines Sixteen million sleepers and pickets in the dark Some of them long sleepers for always Some of them tumbling to sleep to morrow for always Fixed in the drag of the world s heartbreak Eating and drinking toiling on a long job of  killing  Sixteen million men   Choose  CHOOSE  The single clenched fist lifted and ready Or the open asking hand held out and waiting Choose For we meet by one or the other  KIN  Brother I am fire Surging under the ocean floor I shall never meet you brother Not for years anyhow Maybe thousands of years brother Then I will warm you Hold you close wrap you in circles Use you and change you Maybe thousands of years brother  PLACES  Roses and gold For you today And the flash of flying flags   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I will have Ashes Dust in my hair  Crushes of hoofs  Your name  Fills the mouth  Of rich man and poor  Women bring Armfuls of flowers And throw on you  I go hungry Down in dreams And loneliness Across the rain To slashed hills  Where men wait and hope for me  OUR PRAYER OF THANKS  God For the gladness here where the sun is shining at evening on the weeds at the river Our prayer of thanks   Our Prayer of Thanks  God For the laughter of children who tumble barefooted and bareheaded in the summer grass Our prayer of thanks  God For the sunset and the stars the women and their white arms that hold us Our prayer of thanks  God  If you are deaf and blind if this is all lost to you  God if the dead in their coffins amid the silver handles on the edge of town or the reckless dead of war days thrown unknown in pits if these dead are forever deaf and blind and lost Our prayer of thanks  God  The game is all your way the secrets and the signals and the system and so for the break of the game and the first play and the last Our prayer of thanks Carl Sandburg   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SONGS  LEAVES  One by one like leaves from a tree All my faiths have forsaken me But the stars above my head Burn in white and delicate red And beneath my feet the earth Brings the sturdy grass to birth I who was content to be But a silken singing tree But a rustle of delight In the wistful heart of night I have lost the leaves that knew Touch of rain and weight of dew Blinded by a leafy crown I looked neither up nor down But the little leaves that die Have left me room to see the sky Now for the first time I know Stars above and earth below  MORNING  I went out on an April morning All alone for my heart was high I was a child of the shining meadow I was a sister of the sky   Morning  There in the windy flood of morning Longing lifted its weight from me Lost as a sob in the midst of cheering Swept as a sea bird out to sea  THE ANSWER  When I go back to earth And all my joyous body  Puts off the red and white That once had been so proud  If men should pass above With false and feeble pity  My dust will find a voice To answer them aloud  Be still I am content Take back your poor compassion  Joy was a flame in me Too steady to destroy Lithe as a bending reed  Loving the storm that sways her  I found more joy in sorrow Than you could find in joy  Sara Teasdale   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PICTURES  Hung in the parlors of the town Are many pictures of tall ships White billowy to their pennon tips  And painted black or shining brown And seeing them the wild thought slips Back to those wild and white sea trips  When Round Pond shared the sea s renown  And all her captains sailed a fleet Long keeled and deep around the Horn Where Del Fuego lies forlorn  In cloudy rack or scudding sleet On other seas of Capricorn Old voyagers knew their house flags borne  Where Indian and Pacific meet  Strong oils and wool from Boston bar Bright silks from busy blue Hong Kong And many a little mellow gong  On the shore wind cleared for Samar And all the isles of Orient song Oh how the wind clipt sails would throng  Great ships who knows now where they are  The captains leave their white walled homes Built out of earnings from far lands   Pictures  But not to take their old commands  Into the wind where water foams The captains leave to helmless hands Are fallen their houses on these sands  Their old wives wither in the rooms  Their children pause with vision spent Dear folk they dabble and put away The majesties of yesterday  No vital pulse no strong event Sweeps in to break their life s delay The steam boat lands leaves them each day  Contented with their discontent  Where is the blood that loved the sea Though old sea commerce be no more Shall children of the sea on shore  Sink dull with careless industry Those painted ships bold purpose bore And what great glorious sails they wore  Pictures that shame posterity  A NEW ENGLAND CHURCH  The white church on the hill Looks over the little bay A beautiful thing on the hill When the mist is gray   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  When the hill looks old and the air turns cold With the dying day  The white church on the hill A Greek in a Puritan town Was built on the brow of the hill For John Wesley s God s renown And a conscience old set a steeple cold On its Grecian crown  In a storm of faith on the hill Hands raised it over the bay When the night is clear on the hill It stands up strong and gray But its door is old and the tower points cold To the Milky Way  The white church on the hill Looks lonely over the town Dim to them under the hill Is its God s renown And its Bible old and its creed grown cold And the letters brown  Wilton Agnew Barrett   THE SCARLET THREAD  With scarlet threads she hung her house That Israel s hosts might know Where dwelt the harlot Rahab on The walls of Jericho The foeman came with sword and spear The ram s horn blew a blast And o er the fallen parapets The tribes exultant passed Their red fires laid the city low Their red swords drank its blood But when they passed the harlot s house They looked and understood For she had shared with Israel s spies Her roof and flaxen bed And fire and sword passed by the house Where hung the scarlet thread Poor Rahab Up and down the world Your outcast daughters go With lives to sell like yours upon The walls of Jericho And though the world shall know them not As mother maid or wife Their scarlet threads shall cling for aye Unto the House of Life  Charles Hamilton Musgrove   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  MIRELLA DANCES  I  Sadie Bimberg that s

Mirella Dances  So a little past sixteen Sadie disappeared On the streets that s where she ll end Said each reassuring friend T o the little crooked mother Brooding on a fate she feared Sadie always was that mean Grumbled Isidore the brother Plucking at his silky beard   II  Out from the wings half shy as half afraid Timidly poised as if for startled flight Fawn like she steps and round her hesitant feet Lurks the charmed circle of the calcium light A moment thus as by her fears delayed She hearkens dryad to the sensuous beat Of savage rhythms then half emboldened sways A little from the hips and then more bold No longer she delays Maenad but with fierce glee and sensual glance Lithe amorous ecstatic uncontrolled Leaps to the footlights in tempestuous dance And they who sit within the darkened hall Feast quick insatiate eyes and smite their hands  When breathless brazen palpitant she stands   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Before the curtain for her twentieth call Twice daily this her triumph and she knows The only world she knows is at her feet   Mirella is the name of Broadway s rose They called her Sadie down in Houston Street  Lee Wilson Dodd   THREE POEMS  THE BOSTON EVENING TRANSCRIPT  The readers of the Boston Evening Transcript Sway in the wind like a field of ripe corn  When evening quickens faintly in the street Wakening the appetites of life in some And to others bringing the Boston Evening Transcript I mount the steps and ring the bell turning Wearily as one would turn to nod good bye to Rochefoucauld If the street were Time and he at the end of the street And I say Cousin Harriet here is the Boston Evening  Transcript  AUNT HELEN  Miss Helen Slingsby was my maiden aunt And lived in a small house near a fashionable square Cared for by servants to the number of four Now when she died there was silence in heaven And silence at her end of the street The shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet He was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before The dogs were handsomely provided for But shortly afterwards the parrot died too   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The Dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece  And the footman sat upon the dining table  Holding the second housemaid on his knees  Who had always been so careful while her mistress lived  COUSIN NANCY  Miss Nancy Ellicott  Strode across the hills and broke them  Rode across the hills and broke them The barren New England hills Riding to hounds Over the cow pasture  Miss Nancy Ellicott smoked And danced all the modern dances And her aunts were not quite sure how they felt about it But they knew that it was modern  Upon the glazen shelves kept watch Matthew and Waldo guardians of the faith The army of unalterable law  T S Eliot   IMAGES  I  Like a gondola of green scented fruits Drifting along the dank canals at Venice You O exquisite one Have entered my desolate city  II  The blue smoke leaps Like swirling clouds of birds vanishing So my love leaps forth towards you Vanishes and is renewed  III  A rose yellow moon in a pale sky When the sunset is faint vermilion In the mist among the tree boughs Art thou to me  IV  As a young beech tree on the edge of a forest Stands still in the evening Yet shudders through all its leaves in the light air And seems to fear the stars So are you still and so tremble   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  V  The red deer are high on the mountain They are beyond the last pine trees And my desires have run with them  VI  The flower which the wind has shaken Is soon filled again with rain So does my mind fill slowly with misgiving Until you return  Richard Aldington   SLAVIC SONGS  OLD RUTHENIAN FOLK SONG  Brother whence comest thou From beyond Dunai What heardest thou in Ukraine  Nothing have I heard Nothing have I seen But horsemen on four sides The Russians have covered the mountain On that mountain a Turkish horse stands On the horse sits a Turk s young son In his right hand he holds a sword From his left blood flows  On that hill a crow is calling And a mother cries over her soldier son  Don t cry mother do not grieve I am wounded but not badly My head in four pieces my heart in six My white hands in three pieces My white fingers in pieces My white body is as fine as poppy seed  Look for a doctor mother The doctor the young carpenter   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Let him build for me a house Without doors or windows For now am I at the end of my life  SONG OF TH E COSSACK  Heavily hangs the rye Bent to the trampled ground While brave men fighting die Through blood the horses hound  Under the white stemmed tree A Cossack bold is slain They lift him tenderly Into the ruined grain  Someone has borne him there  Someone has put in place A scarlet cloth with prayer Over the up turned face  Softly a girl has come Dove like she looks all gray Stares at the soldier dumb And crying goes away  Then swift another maid Ah how unlike she is   Song of the Cossack  With grief and passion swayed Gives him her farewell kiss  The third one does not cry Caresses none has she Three girls thy love flung by Death rightly came to thee  WHERE LUCK LIES  From the Ukrainian of Fedkovich  You my brother stayed at home Threshing out the beans I hied me to Germany Seeking where my Luck might be League on league to roam  Under Bukowina s sky Even there I went Passed the flinty Tyrol s bar Wandered till I reached a star Wandering still am I  Ah my brother you did well Threshing all the while Luck that would not come to me Luck I went so far to see In your beans it fell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE LOVER IN STRAWBERRY TIME  While I pick the berries sweet In the woods near where you live Oh Kohanka let us meet Happiness to me you ll give  Kokhanits I ve much to do I ve no time to roam about Not an hour to play with you Lest my fire may go out  Oh Kohanka how you slave You would surely lose your life If forevermore you gave All your time to clean a knife  I was born O vagrant one Not to sit in rocking chair Happier I when all is done Than a rich man s daughter fair  She has but her hair to curl I make all things fair to see Work has never killed a girl Work will never finish me  THE DAY BEFORE THE WEDDING  The bride sings to her lover  Broad were the leaves on the lofty tree   The Day Before the Wedding  Why came you not last night to me I wonder But of course Maybe you had no horse Maybe you lost your way Your mother made you stay  Her lover replies I had the horse and the way I knew And my mother kept me not from you  But my youngest sister loves you not  She hid my saddle in some strange spot  My oldest sister sought and found  Swift on my horse s back twas bound  She whispered Try and get there soon  Riding along by the light o the moon  In body brave keep a good head  Brother o mine she laughing said  In Sweetheart Land there s much to learn The road has many a curve and turn  Don t lose your horse don t go astray  Ride ere yet dawns your wedding day  Florence Randal Livcsay  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  EDITORIAL COMMENT  OUR BIRTHDAY  WIT H this number POETRY begins its fourth  year Three years have passed of the five as  sured to us by the generosity of more than  one hundred lovers of the art  POETRY has a fighting edge an editor wrote to us recently by way of compliment And no doubt we should keep the edge polished since art whose quest is beauty which is truth needs to carry a sword for her enemies But today let us sheathe that august weapon if we can find it and bury the hatchet which might open a path through all thickets Let us seek a clearing in these western woods and light our three candles and invite the fairies and gather around the birthday cake for a love feast  For art is love as well as war As artists we are imitators of God engaged in a sublime or preposterous effort to give ourselves away to present to the world the life that is in us in some form so beautiful that it can not die How far are we living up to our rôle How far are we creators of life diviners of truth singers at the cross roads pointing out the way How far are we seers and prophets minds illumined who read the centuries backward and forward as astronomers read the suns  Or if we are not great enough for the supreme vision and the crown of fire what are we doing to immortalize the fleeting moment to tell the tale of the tribe to the next   Our Birthday  age Have our voices been bugles of hope lutes of joy drums of power to put courage and faith into men s hearts fill their lives with ardor  Or if we are not sure and simple enough to tell the tale of the tribe are we expressing beauty in detail showing that every experience is emotion Are we lifting men and women out of the inertness of their fate till the passing hour is color in their eyes and music in their ears Is each of our songs a thing of perfect clarity and truth like the trill of a bird  No doubt we have compromised we have followed false gods we have kept our eyes on the ground and strayed into narrow places and been content with little But tonight we are under the open sky and the fairies have wreathed our bowl Let us lift it high with a pledge none may refuse To the art to the poets who are coming May their vision be deeper than ours their hearts higher their song grander And may we gather their audience for them and light the torch for them and keep each orchestral instrument in tune H M  POETIC DRAMA  It has been said that we shall never have fine poetic drama in this country until we have fine realistic prose drama This may be true although it suggests a reversal of the usual order poetic drama has usually preceded what we call realism on the stage even as tragedy precedes comedy and comedy precedes farce From the present meagre fare offered us by poetic playwrights we need not predicate a   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  continuous famine Prose playwrights have furnished us very little more that is substantial very little that lasts beyond a season s run Beside continental authors the American playwright as evidenced in recent books giving a comparative outlook makes but a poor showing And England is not much better off Critics have tried to help the situation by declaring that the American playwright is learning his craft the well made play often the antithesis of all that is abundant and vital growing steadily in amount if not in quality The critics fail to realize that this is a purely external gain if gain at all the inherent weakness of American plays being a poverty of imagination Ingenuity and plot can not atone for this defect The need is deeper and more serious than one suspects  Poverty of imagination implies a lack of sympathetic understanding of character and there can be no fine drama without this understanding In our plays today we have types rather than personalities external action rather than that internal conflict of destiny or character out of which really vital drama springs The word conflict itself has become narrowed in meaning through its connection with plot but it is not in that sense that it is used here The stage has become a platform for sociological propaganda for reform for all sorts of current journalistic ideas Nowhere do we find that beauty of life intensified in moments of grief or passion which endears the older dramatists to our memory If Homer were alive to day Mr Yeats says he would only resist after a deliberate struggle the temptation   Poetic Drama  to find his subject not in Helen s beauty that every man has desired nor in the wisdom and endurance of Odysseus that has been the desire of every woman that has come into the world but in what he would describe perhaps as the inevitable contest arising out of economic causes between the country places and small towns on the one hand and upon the other the great city of Troy representing one knows not what tendency to centralization What hope then is there for poetic drama of a fine imaginative quality There is every hope in the world just because of the supreme need  A new order of poetic playwrights must be created will be created if we dare prophesy so much in answer to the demand that is already manifested in many subtle ways Would there be so many organizations hopefully devoted to the cause of the drama if there were not this hunger for vital imaginative plays The attempt of the manager to satisfy this special kind of hunger with dramatized fairy tales and romantic spectacles is in itself significant But these after all are not what we want we want plays immediate to our life lifted into that larger life which mirrors a nation an individual or a community We want something as much of us as Synge s plays are of the life of the Irish people In them we find the complete fusion of realism and poetic imagination and that is what we need in America Deirdre is not merely a queen but a woman One trouble with our poet playwrights is usually that their queens are consistently queens their kings kings They serve as counters and we neither grieve with them very deeply nor love   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  them very much They are types of another kind than those used by the prose playwright That is all In attempting the universal the poet achieves only the general always colorless and cold Only the specific is universal In the genuine creation of character the type takes care of itself The truth as Rodin says is in the modeling  When however we find American poets as capable of creating character as Robert Frost and Edgar Lee Masters have recently proved themselves we have every reason to believe that there is in this country an abundance of power that is none the less in reserve although still undiscovered It is significant also that both these men in their verse technique have broken away from the stereotyped conventional metres seeking inflections of rhythm in sympathy with internal necessity and this is another indication of promise for the future of poetic drama  The new order of playwrights will not give us pale imitations of Elizabethan blank verse English blank verse may furnish the norm as it has served Mr frost or Mr Yeats but the new rhythm of the poet playwrights will be a speech rhythm direct nervous compact and individual This too we may safely predicate or at least this much If we could predicate also that the new poetic play would not be literary not a book play full of book speech but a play based upon a sure instinct for dramatic values and what is this instinct but a sense of the contrast the light and shade of incident revealing character then indeed we could completely prophesy the play for which we are looking   Poetic Drama  When Deirdre knowing the sure fate that will overtake herself and Naisi should they return to Ireland yet gives the word to go because of taunting words spoken by Naisi we have the essence of that mingled motive which makes drama Much that we call dramatic in plays today is merely an external trick like pressing the wrong button getting into the wrong room or enclosing letters in the wrong envelopes Character has nothing to do with it The new playwright will not go on crutches  It may be that this prophecy is too hopeful But prophecies very often create their own fulfilment And it is in this faith that we call attention to the announcement in this number of a special request for a poetic play which the Players Producing Company of Chicago makes through POETRY  A C H  AT THE FAIR  The editor has made the grand tour The Yellowstone San Francisco San Diego the Grand Canon with the plains and deserts and mountains the rivers and lakes and seas that lie along or between these were her spectacular vacation from desks and doors from poets and prosers And now she is tempted to grow garrulous after the manner of adventurers since the cave dweller carved on the rock the story of his travels  Since nature preserves her monuments while spendthrift man destroys his in this year of grace since the two Pacific fairs must soon furl their banners and put out their lights   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  let us begin by saluting their ardent and perishable beauty Even a magazine so specialized as ours may not omit some mention of this latest international festival for these bubble cities are poems of our age songs of praise that die as they are uttered and live only in memory I have loved flowers that fade sang the Laureate why may we not then love these fabrics of an hour these cloud capped towers and gorgeous palaces built not for permanence to perpetuate the glory of kings but for a dream s length to express a people s aspiration Are they mere costly extravaganzas wasteful in life and ignoble in death these joy cities which cost more than dreadnoughts and flaunt their flags for a briefer season Or is peace indeed more glorious than war and a great festival of nations better worth its price than a battle  What is most beautiful in San Francisco s bubble city For me the first memorable picture was the water front the Marina as I emerged the first morning from the grandiloquent courts The sun shone clear on blue bay and purple mountains on orange domes and Spanish portals and creamy eucalyptus shaded walls Beyond the yacht harbor with its crowd of little boats rose the California Building which taking its motive from the old missions is the finest design on the grounds The tall Column of Progress lifted its salute to the sun and the gay little caravel climbing its spiral seemed to sail off happily from its shaft into the sky  I liked the creamy walls with their skilfully stony surface the long slender drooping eucalyptus blowing its wash of green against them was as beautiful as falling waters   At the Fair  liked the pale orange domes and banners the battle ships in the bay the brightly dressed crowds gathering on the green for some festival The picture was perfect and complete I reflected upon its value for thousands of our fellow countrymen who get from these festival cities their first impression of what the united arts may do for men  Afterwards I assembled other pictures in my gallery Never from the entrance plaza where the Fountain of Energy seemed too energetic the façades too crowded and the Tower of Jewels done by Carrère and Hastings usually so discreet merely a showy anachronism But the fountains in the Court of the Universe with that ecstatic figure of the Rising Sun lifting us up like the song of a lark The long cloistral colonnades of the Court of Abundance meeting in a high square tower with the sky through its arches and all flaring out at night with great red torches from serpent guarded basins The proud rotunda of the art building mirrored in its little pool seeming to suggest the pomp of kings to our farmers and traders  And then a thousand lesser surprises beauty in ambush to take one unaware The little alcoves of the Fountain of Youth and the Fountain of El Dorado so near to the crowd and yet always so still and secret The tangles of green and color in odd corners the carpets of purple violets and yellow pansies the rows of monumental palms praising the old travertine walls  And everywhere sculpture No doubt too much sculpture at times but why should not art be over prodigal when   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  she is playing with plaster for an hour of gladness In these festal cities the arts try their experiments the Centennial the Columbian each began an epoch and no doubt the Panama Pacific will prove also a far reaching influence Our sculptors have learned much since ninety three especially in their decorative reliefs more than our mural painters for Mr Brangwyn s brilliant panels badly placed as they are far out distance even the lovely pediments of Mr Hassam and Mr Holloway the best of the Americans But the sculptors were given a free field while the painters had a narrow one  The night transfigured all this of course and added sometimes a new beauty But there was too little night night was brighter than day in the great courts and even the fireworks were lit up with search lights Night should not be banished by a glare in such a pageant but emphasized by soft lights discreetly used so that its mystery enfolds and enhances great buildings  The little old Spanish San Diego exposition is a thing of perfect unity and charm For me it will always possess two magic memories I had been told to stay out of doors but in the beautiful California Building I found in the superb reproductions of Maya sculpture and architecture from Yucatan the revelation of a new grand style a style utterly unlike Egyptian Greek Chinese Gothic or any other system of design hitherto known to history but like them original authoritative and inspired I was feeling like stout Cortez with a new world swimming in my ken what a marvelous   At the Fair  age is ours to bring all strange things near when as I emerged on the little plaza a lighter emotion chased away the sublimities For there the most enchanting group of gaily colored Spanish singer dancers were exciting tropical emotions in Puritan tourists I never saw anything so vividly and mischievously gay as the flashing laugh which one or two golden beauties turned up into stodgy Yankee faces nor anything so funny as the sheepish half hearted smile they got in return It seemed too good to be true the little Spanish plaza with all this happy youth in it Romeo like boys flashing gipsy humored girls twanging their guitars and singing and dancing on a level with us to make the romantic old time live again  As I left the two fairs behind me their beauty faded before older memories Why was there a magic in the Columbian fair which no other has possessed Was it merely that I saw it in youth and in my own city where my friends had planned and built it Or was it the softness of summer days and nights which San Francisco misses perched as she is on her hills between the fog blown sea and the great bay Neither of these reasons was quite enough to explain the persistent glory of that White City in Jackson Park which has gone the way of all flesh No other festal city has been so spacious by land and water with buildings so nobly grouped beside large lagoons No other has achieved the Venetian magic of water life among palaces little launches and gondolas moving from building to building between mirrored colonnades or drifting around a   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  wooded island as wild as a Sierran valley and then passing out into the dark lake until the city was a string of jewels in the distance And at night when the palaces were hung with lights that trailed gold fringes in the water when the boats drifted in and out of shadows and iridescent domes and towers faded off into darkness then was a passion of great beauty evoked out of dust and fire for a moment all unreal things were real and dreams had the hardihood of marble  No gala city was ever so beautiful as this Columbian City at night We Americans are wasteful of our treasure spendthrift even of memories But this was a consummate perfect thing let us not cast it away but keep it in our hearts  H M  REVIEWS  ROBERT BRIDGES NEW BOOK  A certain element in the American literary weeklies and monthlies is still descanting on its opinion that vers libre won t do We are expected to read long papers full of abstract and indefinite words saying that the poet s true freedom etc is not to be gained through this gate The writers must be innocent of any knowledge of the poetic tradition otherwise they would know that practically all forms of verse date from antiquity China and India and Greece had free verse before some forgotten Italian got stuck in the beginning of a canzone and called the fragment a sonnet   Robert Bridges New Book  Egypt had vowel chants and the middle ages their polyrythmical sequaires and litanies  And after all these things came the English exposition of 1851 and the Philadelphia Centennial introducing cast iron house decorations and machine made wood fret work and there followed a generation of men with minds like the cast iron ornament and they set their fretful desire upon machine like regularity Miss Mitford had objected to Dante because he was Gothic the indigenous Anglo Saxon rhythms were neglected because society did not read Anglo Saxon And the most imitative generation of Americans ever born on our continent set themselves to exaggerating the follies of England  For these provincials it is what I can call by no more fitting name than a smack in the eye that Robert Bridges Laureate whose name is almost a synonym for classic and scholarly poetry should have labeled one poem in his latest book experiment in free verse  Robert Bridges work has been always a subject for debate There is the party which compares it to the innumerable pseudo renaissance classic façades of the buildings of the University of London etc and finds it unreadable and the opposing party which says that if one will only read through the collected edition he will find a reasonable number of poems which will stand comparison with the best in the language   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Beyond dispute his command of the sheer mechanics of quantitative verse can be looked on with nothing but envy I have a grave respect for any man who is restless and persistent in the study and honor of his craft  There are two poems in his last book which it is better to quote than to comment on The first shows well what he has won from untiring practice of quantitative metres and from I should think the reading of Middle English It is as follows  THE FLOWERING TREE  What fairy fann d my dreams while I slept in the sun As if a flowering tree were standing over me Its young stem strong and lithe went branching overhead And willowy sprays around fell tasseling to the ground All with wild blossom gay as is the cherry in May When her fresh flaunt of leaf gives crowns of golden green  The sunlight was emmesh d in the shifting splendor And I saw through on high to soft lakes of blue sky Ne er was mortal slumber so lapt in luxury Rather Endymion would I sleep in the sun Neath the trees divinely with day s azure above When my love of beauty is met by beauty s love   Robert Bridges New Book  So I slept enchanted under my loving tree Till from his late resting the sweet songster of night Rousing awaken d me Then this the birdis note Was the voice of thy throat which thou gav st me to kiss  The other poem is a brief epigram bitter as Palladas full of emotional violence held in by rigid delicate barriers  èr amp ôiov à doç âpobptjç  Who goes there God knows I m nobody How shall I answer Can t jump over a gate nor run across the meadow I m but an old whitebeard of inane identity Pass on What s left of me today will very soon be nothing  This is worthy of a place in the Greek anthology not only because it is hard and concise as their epigrams but because it is novel It is the only poem I can think of which shows quite this sense of the attrition of personality through living It is not age which speaks but a mood that is permanent and recurrent in life and therefore so fine a matter of art  The thin volume contains also some whimsical lines on Flycatchers inspired possibly by the sight of some of his colleagues on the Academic Committee but the American reader may imagine that it was written about this or that well known editor and get from it an equal pleasure Dr Bridges recalls the time when a chubby young chap he sat with others on a school form   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  While an authoritative old wiseacre Stood over us and from a desk fed us with flies  Dead flies such as litter the library south window That buzzed at the panes until they fell stiff baked on the sill  A dry biped he was nurtured likewise  On skins and skeletons stale from top to toe  With all manner of rubbish and all manner of lies  The island is to be congratulated on having at last obtained a laureate who declines to treat himself as an institution E P  Irradiations Sand and Spray by John Gould Fletcher The  New Poetry Series Houghton Mifflin Co  Let us completely forget for a moment the fact that Mr Fletcher is one of the Imagists there has been lately so much idle controversy on the subject and consider him simply as a poet  His most marked personal characteristic is an extreme sensitiveness to impressions He gives us the sense of nature not a description the thrill of trees in the wind of boats under sail or steamers plunging through heavy seas like black plunging dolphins with red bellies of shifting wrinkled sand dunes or the mad ballet of the summer sky His is not the art of the symbolist although it is largely impressionistic In intention it is as far removed from the school of descriptive landscape poets as a Japanese painting is from a Hudson River primitive His method is closely allied to music not only in verse form but in sub   Reviews  stance He uses words to convey impressions more often expressed in music or in painting  Perhaps that is why he along with other Imagists has been accused of a lack of passion It all depends upon what one means by the word The emotion of color or the emotion of sound is sufficient for the musician or the painter Mr Fletcher sees nature very much as the painter or the musician and that is the way I think he means us to feel nature in his poems with however the addition of one element which belongs pre eminently to poetry the gift of creative metaphor In many of his poems Mr Fletcher is entirely successful If one must look for weakness in his method I think it is in a certain tendency to pile too many sensations one upon another There is a certain cumulative effect but the clear image is blurred One retains not so much a definite impression of the whole as a succession of impressions like a threading of beads that never complete the circle of a necklace Occasionally single lines or groups of lines are perfect in themselves I remember particularly certain passages from his Blue Symphony published in POETRY  O old pagodas of my soul how you glittered across green trees  or this  And a heron that cries out from the water   and this  Now in my palace I see foot passengers Crossing the river Pilgrims of autumn In the afternoons   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  These are instances of Mr Fletcher s power to create beautiful impressions with a few words And sometimesthink he uses too many That is certain words or phrases impede the impression rather than add to it This is a minor defect but its correction would contribute greater strength to his style Mr Fletcher s sea symphony Sand and Spray is a spirited experiment Although there are delightful movements in it I do not feel that its effect as a whole is so fine as that of his Blue Symphony perhaps because motion and sound and color strive constantly for mastery one above the other and are not finally resolved as they might be in music The symphonic poem demands a poet s full strength Sidney Lanier s Marshes of Glynn was a deliberate attempt to achieve the effect of music in poetry It was rhythmic but it remained descriptive and objective Less obviously Whitman s When Lilacs Last in the Door yard Bloomed and Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking are symphonic poems that achieve a perfect synthesis  Many of the finest Irradiations were published in POETRY in 1913 This however is one that will be new to our readers  The balancing of gaudy broad pavilions Of summer against the insolent breeze The bellying of the sides of striped tents Swelling taut shuddering in quick collapse Silent under the silence of the sky  Earth is streaked and spotted With great splashes and dapples of sunlight The sun throws an immense circle of hot light upon the world Rolling slowly in ponderous rhythm Darkly musically forward   Reviews  All is silent under the steep cone of afternoon  The sky is imperturbably profound  The ultimate divine union seems about to be accomplished  All is troubled at the attainment  Of the inexhaustible infinite  The rolling and the tossing of the sides of immense pavilions  Under the whirling wind that screams up the cloudless sky  A C H  Processionals by John Curtis Underwood Mitchell Ken  nerley  The name of John Curtis Underwood has for a long time been associated with the literature of insurgency and this volume is no exception It is first of all a passionately idealistic commentary on life and only secondarily a book of verse The spirit of the whole is the cosmic spirit which John Alford amusingly deplores in American poetry with its real strength of evolutionary optimism and its consequent loss of clarity and definite conceptions  Mr Underwood is too vague too lacking in lyric poignancy too careless of his choice of words to be distinguished as a poet He writes in complicated rhyme and rhythm schemes and is very fond of the rapid beats those which in Sidney Lanier s method of notation would be three four time and four four time with only one strong beat to the measure But in English these forms like their counterparts the waltz and the march have a tendency to carry the mind forward so swiftly with the beat of the rhythm that the sense is lost Mr Underwood has not escaped the danger And in this volume which is two hundred and seventy pages he   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  has paraphrased his best ideas so many times that the effect is weakened  Yet considered not as pure art but as the expression of a spiritual attitude the book is valuable It is essentially modern in spirit expressive of the best contemporary ideals and is evidently written by a man who realizes deeply the spiritual complexities of life to day The poems are too long to quote but The Public Library and Revenants are among the best  E T  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  WHAT WOULD WALT THINK  And by the way what oh what do you suppose Walt would have thought of Miss Monroe s magazine if he had lived to see it So asks Mr John L Hervey in a recent letter to The Dial The question is delightfully suggestive We would love to know just what Walt Whitman would have thought of POETRY It is not impossible that Mr Hervey thinks that Walt would have thought of POETRY just what he Mr Hervey thinks of the magazine No doubt it is under this conviction that Mr Hervey delivers this last smashing blow Still there isn t any way of being sure that Walt would have come out on Mr Hervey s side Walt was very tolerant tolerant of poets you remember his charming I like your tinkle Tom to Thomas Bailey Aldrich also tolerant of editors of Richard Watson Gilder to whom Whitman s November Boughs did not appeal for publication in The Century   What Would Walt Think  No it s a toss up just what Walt would have thought about the magazine Undoubtedly he would have thought about it just as each of you whoever you are now reading this magazine think about it For the great dead curiously enough always mold their opinions to suit their admirers  But why is it a sacrilege to speak disrespectfully of poets after they are dead and have secured a fair modicum of public approval Walt admired Bryant s qualities Must every admirer of Whitman also admire Bryant Miss Monroe thinks that the majority of Bryant s poems would mean little to us if published for the first time today And now Mr Hervey wants Miss Monroe to say what Carl Sandburg s poems will mean to the reader of fifty years hence if she thinks any of them will live that long Mr Hervey himself does not risk a direct opinion Fortunately there were people intelligent and courageous enough to risk an opinion on Whitman fifty years ago And these people were not the editors of magazines who knew what the people wanted and took no risks If Whitman had waited for them Mr Hervey might have missed his Walt and he would then have had to invoke some other shadowy figure possibly Bryant to pass mythical judgment upon the new poetry At any rate it is amusing to wonder what Bryant would have thought of Carl Sandburg s poetry and even more interesting to conjecture the possible opinion of Whitman Would Walt applaud the risk taken by Miss Monroe in publishing it or would he too like Mr Hervey be shocked by her temerity A C H   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A PARTISAN VERDICT  Painters very rarely enter the field of criticism they are too busy painting Their selections or rejections are made privately and the result is seen in their canvases When painters or sculptors have written or talked about their work in letters or in recorded conversations they have given us a body of creative criticism far finer than anything the critic who is not a painter or a sculptor may undertake to add  I sometimes wish that poets confined their writing to poetry that the only criticism indulged in by them was the intimate sort expressed in letters or conversations Today it is so easy for poets to rush into criticism and so much of their criticism consists in smashing other people s windows instead of in making their own windows clear As I remember the prefaces of the older poets these were not used as battle grounds or as totem poles on which were displayed proudly the scalps of neighboring chieftains Yet it is this purpose which the preface very often serves for the poet today who can it seems establish his own position only by explaining the futility of the work of some brother poet And this preface then serves as a clew for the reviewer who prolongs the discussion of irrelevant values and establishes none the intrinsic beauty of the poet reviewed often receiving little attention It is not that one questions the worth of destructive criticism in itself but that one distrusts and is annoyed by ex cathedra statements not sustained by a critique raisonné of the craft of poetry as such T o cite examples  from recent prefaces would only lead us into the pitfalls   A Partisan Verdict  herein deplored But a more flagrant example of a tendency to substitute irritability for criticism can not be allowed to pass without a word of protest  I have not read the whole of Mr Joyce Kilmer s attack upon the so called Tagore craze as it appeared in America but as I read the excerpts from his article quoted in The Literary Digest I cannot help feeling that it is not really as a poet that Mr Kilmer has approached the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore  Mr Tagore is a Hindu and not a Catholic I should hesitate to call him less a Christian than many that I know but if Mr Tagore had been born a Catholic whether in Brooklyn or Calcutta would Mr Kilmer have felt that it was unfitting to link his name with that of St Francis or Thomas à Kempis  Of Gerard Hopkins a Catholic poet Mr Kilmer has written His theme being God and his writing being an act of adoration it is profitless to criticise him as Mr Bridges has done for sacrificing simplicity and violating the canons of taste Yet Mr Kilmer objects to the exotic symbols temple bells water jars and the desert the ordinary symbols of Mr Tagore s daily life which the poet uses to express that desire for the mystical union with God which is the theme of both Gerard Hopkins and Rabindranath Tagore One might of course object to the Bible on the score of exoticism  Certainly Mr Kilmer has failed signally to appreciate  the essential spirit of this man who would he says sub   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  stitute fatalism for hope Nirvana for Heaven Krishna for Jesus Christ To the mind of the true mystic the goal is one I doubt very much if the mind of the mystic recognizes any distinction between Krishna and Jesus Christ except as these distinctions exist in the dogma of racial or religious sectarians  Utterly without pretense of any sort Rabindranath Tagore makes no attempt towards either fashionable or religious proselytizing It is simply as a poet that he wishes to be accepted by those who care to accept him  A C H  PRIZE ANNOUNCEMENTS  POETRY announces a prize of one hundred dollars donated by the Players Producing Company for
