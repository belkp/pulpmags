The book contains rollick- ing ballads, light lyrics, longer odes and sim- ple and powerful songs, yet in all the versatile product we see the same virility, the same love of wholesome beauty.

With an Introduction, by Gifford Pxnchot. The heroine is Lee Virginia Wetherford, the memory of whose father is execrated at Roaring Fork, because in the   rustlers  war  he had taken sides with the cattle barons and had been driven out of the country. Virginia returns from Philadelphia, where she had been attending school, to find the West of her childhood changed as she enters the home of her mother, Lize Wetherford, who runs a malodorous eating-house. Ross Cavanagh, the forest ranger, comes down to procure pro- visions and to get his mail. The young people are at once profoundly interested in each other. As the story proceeds, Cavanagh is driven to defending his reservation against the encroachments of those who regard the national forest as a legitimate poaching-place. Cavanagh represents, indeed, the far-off Federal authority, and displays a soldier s loyalty. Here the real story begins enthralling and ennobling to the final page. Wilh Frontispiece.

I felt I had to write this story because I knew this wistful, mirthful, little orphan. Mary Cary never walks when she can skip or dance. She is like a sprite that touched with a light kiss all the loved things, and at the unloved would not give even a look. I have seen her quiver in the abandonment of joy, dance on her tip-toes in delight; but I have also seen her in a passion of anger, with eyes blazing through a flood of tears. I can- not wholly put into words her singular charm, her peculiar appeal, her wise, whimsical sayings.  A story for every one a story even to meet that severest test reading aloud.

Ituiii a photograph l y Kcnait UooScvelt M AG AZI N E NOTES Kach new chapter of Mr. Roosevelt s nar- rative about his African journey is so varied both in scene ami experiences that it constantly holds and piques the reader s interest. Since the first number, which was sold out immedi- ately, there has been an undiminished and in- creasing demand for the Magazine. With the approaching return of the author to civilization  he will probably be in Cairo by the time this number is published there is a renewed in- terest in all he writes. Tn ihe May number will appear the account of the journey "To Lake Naivasha,  where he had some exciting moments hunting hippos in  he papyrus swamps. On one occasion ihe great beasts came up under the boat, to the imminent danger of all concerned. An impres- sion that one gets from each one of these articles is the existence of almost incredible numbers of wild game. Mr. Roosevelt says that a dozen lions his party killed would  have accounted for the death of seven or eight hundred buck, pig, and zebra within the next year.  Along with the great abundance of animal life goes the inevitable struggle for existence.  Death by violence, death by cold, death by starvation these are the normal endings of the stately and beautiful creatures of the wilderness. The sentimentalists who prattle about the peace- ful life of nature do not realize its utter merciless- ness; although all they would have to do would be to look at the birds in the winter woods, or even at the insects on a cold morning or cold evening. Life is hard and cruel for all the lower creatures, and for man also in what the senti- mentalists call a  state of nature.   An article on  The Increased Cost of Living,  by Professor J. Laurence Laughlin, to appear in the May number will deal with a question that is insistently present in the minds of a very large part of the community. The auth  r has written within recent months for ihe magazine on economic and social topics, and readers will remember with how much clearness and knowl- edge of essential facts. In this article Professor Laughlin gives the reasons for the advancement of prices, and then points out some remedies that should prove effective. Standards of living have greatly changed, and the ever-growing num- ber of ihe successfully rii h is setting a pace that affecls the entire community. Professor Laughlin asks, "May it not be the psycholog- ical hour to call for the creation of a new aristocracy of the simple life of those who care for the realitv. not the shadow Simp- ler living and higher thinking are apparently among ihe remedies for the rise in prices as well as eifective restraints upon the restless and men iless striving after monev getting. Present conditions are due to many causes that Professor Laughlin dearly points out. One paragraph concerning the question of re- tail prices especially applies to city dwellers who are dependent upon the small groceries and butchers for their house-keeping There is no fixed and equitable arrangement of prices. Charge all you can get seems the only basis of such business. The rise of farm and food products is due to special causes, among them high tariffs, higher wages, increasing ex- penditures of the rich. Professor Laughlin writes with a full knowledge of the facts, and MAGAZINE NOTES irv he makes them int rc tinn because lie never forgets that his la'ts arc- lull of significant human interest.

Malbone stands without a rivai. His work is not as generally known as it should be, for there arc onlv a comparatively few examples owned bv museums. Boston possesses tile portrait ol his friend Allston. R. T. II. Halsey, who will be remembered for his delightful article about Josiah Wedgwood, has written about  Malbone and Ilis Miniatures" for the May number. 'I he illustrations from some oi ihe artist', most famous miniatures will be a very notable feature. A number of them reproduced in colors give with delicacv and remarkable accuracy the i tialities of the originals.

The lion stopped and lay down behind a bush; jumping off I took a shot at him at two hundred yards, but only wounded him slightly in one paw; and after a moment s sullen hesitation off he went, lashing his tail. We mounted our horses and went after him; Tarlton lost sight of him, but I marked him lying down behind a low grassy ant hill. Again we dismounted at a distance of two hundred yards; Tarlton telling me that now he was sure to charge. In all East Africa there is no man, not even Cuninghame him- self, whom I would rather have by me than Tarlton, if in difficulties with a charging lion; on this occasion, however, I am glad to say that his rifle was badly sighted, and shot altogether too low. Again I knelt and fired; but the mass of hair on the Hon made me think he was near- er than he was, and I undershot, inflicting a flesh wound that was neither crippling nor fatal. He was already grunting savagely and tossing his tail ercct, with his head held low; and at the shot the great sinewy beast came toward us with the speed of a grey- hound. Tarlton then, very properly, tired, for lion hunting is no child s play, and it is not good to run risks. Ordinarily it is a very mean thing to experience joy at a friend s miss; but this was not an ordinary case, and I felt keen delight when the bullet from the badly sighted rifle missed, striking the ground many yards short. I was sight- ing carefully, from my knee, and f knew I had the lion all right; for though he gal- loped at a great pace, he came on steadily  ears laid back, and utteringterrificcough- ing grunts and there was now no question of making allowance for distance, nor, as he was out in the open, for the fact that he had not before been distinctly visible. The bead of my foresight was exactly on thecen- tre of his chest as I pressed the trigger, and the bullet went as true as if the place had been plotted with dividers. The blow brought him up all standing, and he fell forward on his head. The soft-nosed Win- chester bullet had gone straight through the chest cavity, smashing the lungs and the big blood-vessels of the heart. Painfully he re- covered his feet, and tried to come on, his Vol. XLVIL  43 ferocious courage holding out to the last; but he staggered, and turned from side to side, unable to stand firmly, still less to ad- vance at a faster pace than a walk. He had not ten seconds to live; but it is a sound principle to take no chances with lions. T arlton hithimwithhis second bullet, prob- ably in the shoulder; and with my next shot I broke his neck. I had stopped him when he was still a hundred yards away; and certainly no finer sight could be imag- ined than that of this great maned lion as he charged. Kermit gleefully  joined us as we walked up to the body; only one of our followers had been able to keep up with him on his two-miles run. He had had a fine view of the charge, from one side, as he ran up, still three hundred yards distant; he could see all the muscles play as the lion galloped in, and then everything relax as he fell to the shock of my bullet. The lion was a big old male, still in his prime. Between uprights his length was nine feet four inches, and his weight four hundred and ten pounds, for he was not fat. We skinned him and started for camp, which we reached after dark. There was a thunder-storm in the south-west, and in the red sunset that burned behind us the rain clouds turned to many gorgeous hues. Then daylight failed, the clouds cleared, and, as we made our way across the form- less plain, the half moon hung high over- head, strange stars shone in the brilliant heavens, and the Southern Cross lay radi- ant above the sky line. Our next camp was pitched on a stony plain, by a winding stream bed still con- taining an occasional rush-fringed pool of muddy water, fouled by the herds and flocks of the numerous Masai. Game was plentiful around this camp. We killed what we needed of the common kinds, and in addition each of us killed a big rhino. The two rhinos were almost exactly alike, and their horns were of the so-called   Keit- Ioa  type; the fore horn twenty-two inches long, the rear over seventeen. The day I killed mine I used all three of my rifles. We all went out together, as Kermit was desir- ous of taking photos of my rhino, if I shot one; he had not been able to get good ones of his on the previous day. We also took the small ox-wagon,so as to bring into camp bodily the rhino if we got it and one or two zebras, of which we wanted the flesh for II Hi .

Kermit had killed an eland bull, and while lie was resting, his gun bearers drew his at- tention to the calling of the honey bird near by. He got up, and as he approached the bird, it flew to another tree in front and again began its twitter. This was repeated again and again as Kermit w alked after il. finally the bird darted round behind his lollnwers, in the direi lion from w hich they had tome; and fora moment they thought il had plaved them  also.

STETSON CkaWEORP ROM where Cuthbert sat at the window of his bungalow lie could look across the reg- imental polo grounds and hear the yelling of the con- testants as they raced up and down the held. Beyond lay the barracks, a couple of sentry boxes, a thin white tape of a road leading over a hill and afar off, so far thiit at times the snowy line of summits was lost in cloud, the blue, billowy ranges of the Himalayas. The officers  club of the Mounted Rifles were playing a native team and, as usual, were being beaten.  I wonder why a white man always has to make such a beastly noise if lie s doing anything   muttered the Captain, relight- ing his cigarette and wishing that he were one of the galloping figures in white khaki instead uf at work at his commentary upon the Malakand campaign, in which he had been a subaltern of cavalry. He swung the trumpet-shaped receiver of his graphophone toward him, and started the machine revolving by its pedal. Once more the tinv needle began cutting into the fast-whirling waxen roll and dropping its microscopic curls into the pan below. Over on the white-and-green gridiron the natives, in a bunch, were trotting back after their fifth goal in succession, their turbans bob- bing up and down like red and green grass- hoppers. Those fellows had the ponies  That mouse-colored one ridden by Rassa Singh was worth all the nineteen of the Rifles  put together and auctioned off at a clip. Captain Cuthbert withdrew his eyes, and with a sigh, began his dictating in a clearly articulated and unnaturally metallic voice.   At this point the escarpment ter- minated abruptly in a precipice some six hundred feet in height, upon the face of which grew clumps of scattered fir-trees, and along the foot of which ran a mountain stream now filled by the spring torrents. Major Ashforth accordingly ordered for- ward a detachment of pioneers to throw a 40S bridge across the river, and made his camp some eleven miles farther down the valley. Next morning, the enemy being reported as still in retreat, the 127th Gourkhas had ad- vanced across the bridge and along the hill below the cliff, when they were suddenly met bv a terrific and deadly lire from above them. Each tree, every crevice, and every boulder behind which a native could gain a foothold had been occupied by tribesmen, who, invisible, picked off our men at their leisure. The 127th retired in good order, leaving forty-three dead upon the hill, and the howitzers were ordered up, which, after two hours  hard fighting, silenced the ene- my's tire.   A rotten go for Ashforth  1 wish 1 could give it to him as hard as he deserves   growled Cuthbert. His own chum, Jack Ilartridge, had been dropped at tlie first lire just because somebody had blundered. He looked up again across the field ex- pectantly. and his eyes were not disap- pointed. Two figures in white, with para- sols, had crossed from the married quarters and were now standing watching the play. One was tall and slender, the oilier tall and more angular. Cuthbert had become used to the sensation of feeling that Mary Stan- ley was near and then looking up and see- ing her. He took it merely as another indisputable indication that lie was in love with her. When one is thinking of another person constantly, it is not extraordinary that such incidents should occur. But he had noticed it in other cases, too. The morning Jack Hartridge had been killed, something had told him about it, and he had said to Beczly, his lieutenant,  Hart- ridge is done for   Beezlv had laughed at him, but in an hour a native rider had brought in the news. And now, as he closed the graphophone, he wondered if Mary knew that he was coming to her. "Bathurst,  he called over his shoulder,  only seven rolls to-day. See if you can t let me have the stuff for correction by mess- time to-mom w.  The   ther Man 10    Very good, sir," r _-  lietl Halhurst, ihe se  rctary, a young man who look every tiling seriously, and his type-writing most uf all.   I t an rattle  em off between nil c and ten in tlie morning. If yuu've n   objee  it 11 I d like tu get off now   lliev'-- a garden party at Major Tuppcr s."  Oh, certainly, go,  if it amuses yuu," returned Cuthbert rather curtly. He wun- dered that any one could "till be at the garden-party age. Then throwing a mufti coat uyer his shouhlers, he whistled lu his pointer, and strolled across to where Miss Stanley and her aunt were standing. Ile had known her only three months, hut he fell that it was the real thing with I im at last. He had been in the service fourteen years. in the hill Nations, in luwer India and in Burmah. Colonels' daughters and colonels  wives had smiled upon him, but he stuck to his work and to his writing, and while his commentaries were in use in every British military school, and lie had won his R.A.S., he had never to his knowledge been in love with a woman. But Culhbert was a disa  puinte l man because lie had dared to tell the truth. Passionately de- voted to his profession, he had made a scientific 'Hub' ,,f modern campaigning, anil on paper was an acknowledged au- thority; l ut his unassailable conclusions had not made him popular in high quarters, and a certain coolness on the part of older officers was reflected in the bearing of the younger men. Cuthbcrt, who was keenly sensitive, withdrew into his shell. He had no influential relatives to pull wires f ,r him :11 the War Office, and he had compara- tively few friends. There were days when the visions of his youth beckoned to him to chuck the grind and seek a happier life  when he saw himself getting sour and oid and grim. But he simply tw irled his moustaches and became gruffer than ever. His messmates said he was a dried pome- granate and had no soul, but had they known the yearning of his lonely heart for companionship thev would have s  oken differently. " Good'-afternoon, Mrs.    cttcrsley.  Ciood-afternoon, Miss Stanley." The girl turned with a smile.   Oh, Captain Cuthbert  The Rillcs arc- being whitewashed  Aren t you ashamed of them  It s a positive tragedy   He looked down into her eyes  blue eyes llcckcd wilh violet I and -aw that under ncath her dialling she was really sorry. Cuthbcrt had often fell that she was sorry for him. And il gave him hope. She was ihe only woman w Iiu had ever stici ecded in gelling him   ut ol himself and making him forge; his   ommcntaries. Women ad mil ted I Ik.I she w as good looking  in a wa    and mi ht be called sympathetic   but she was  highlv-tighlv.  'Are   ou going to Major Tuppcr s    he asked, as he said nothing.   No," he answ ered.   I shal I be on   I n I   . Bill tomorrow what are vou going to do lo nn  rri  w   Will you come b  r a ride with me J I deserve some i om pen -at ion 1 or this defeat." He lowered his voire.  And I I want o ti ll you a lot of things." M i ss Stanley turned suddenly awa . Slu- liked Cuthbert likrd him immensely . She kneyv his loneliness ami his ambition, and she respei ted him above all men w horn she had met. She had tried lo discourage his attentions yvithout hurling his feelings, but finding this impossible- had permitted their friendship to take on a phase which she yvcll kneyv might end disastrously for both of them. And noyy she tell that the time had come yvhen she must tell him  and perhaps break his hear; lliai another man or his ghost stood between them. The angular Mrs. W'cttcrslcy nodded vig orouslv to her niece right in front of Cuth bert 's nose, and he took eon rage. 1 lie gi     I lady knew Mary's romance and heartily disapproved ofit.  Sentimentality. Just loolish sentimentality,  she called it in conversation yvilh her IriencN Nothing else. Why should a girl glow into an old maid simply because she had loved a man yy ho was not yvurthv of her, but might pos- sibly  tin remotest possible possibly be- come so  It was time for Mary lo get settled, and Cuthbert was as eligible as anybody, more eligil.de than most. Miss Stanley did not ansyver for a mo- ment or two. The Rillcs had the ball close to the goa. post, and il looked almost as if-- But no  Rassa Singh had the ball- driv- ing il down the field like a cannon-shot. Then she looked the Captain full in the face.  Acs,  she answered, yvilh a faint smile,   1 11 go. Have the ponies brought around at live o clock. I wish you were playing w ith the team this afternoon.  410 The Other Man  Thank you,  said he.   I wish I were  and that you were watching. If I didn't get the ball away from  hat Ras a Singh  something would happen   The next momjng at eleven o clock Cuthbert was sitting in his shirt sleeves, with a cigarette in his mouth and a brandy and soda near at hand, trying to correct a pile of week-old manuscript. He had slept badly. Vague and ominous dreams, full of black shadows, had left him excited and irritable. Once in the night he had awaked and, stepping through the door of his bun- galow, had looked across to where Mary Stanley slept at Major Wetterslev s. He was trying to pull himself together, but it was hard work, and he had been unneces- sarily disagreeable to little Bathurst all the morning.  Excuse me, sir,  said the boy nervously at that moment,  there s something the matter with this confounded roll. I m sure it s not my fault. I ve reversed the recording-needle and put on the other all right, but all that comes out is a sort of roar. Sounds as if a couple of chaps were quarrelling. It s curious it s never hap- pened before. I m afraid the bally thing is broken.  Cuthbert poorly controlled his impa- tience.  Let me hear it   said he. The boy started the treadle. Instantly a confused uproar began in which two people seemed to be shouting at each other at the same time. Cuthbert pulled his moustache and swore forcibly.  I don t know, sir,  remarked Bathurst apologetically.  But I m afraid you ve been talking into the same roll twice.   Never did such a thing in my life   re- torted the Captain sharply.  Well, some one has " answered Bath- urst.  Do you suppose Grimes could have had the gall-   Shh  Keep still a moment   ordered the Captain. The contending voices rose and fell in- sistently contradicting. Here and there a few words would emerge separate and dis- tinct, then the other person would begin his quarrelling again, and the confusion would become distracting. ' I know one thing, sir,  said Bathurst,  and that is that at least one of those voices is yours your usual dictating voice, sir  and the other is lower and not so distinct  more as if who ever it was were just talk- ing along in an ordinary lone.   Can vou make out anything the other voice says    Only a word here and there just then, for instance  ivory.    Yes, I heard  ivory,   said Cuthbert.  And every once in a while I catch other words. I believe if we turned her down slow we might separate the voices. I d like to find out who s been fooling with this machine.  They reduced the speed and made the graphophone repeat the first few words. It was now easy to distinguish the metallic tones in which Cuthbert systematically dic- tated his commentaries.  At   this   point   the -  escarp- ment   bhrr   rr   rr  ated   abruptly   bhrr   rr   dark, oily water   rr   rr   some   six   hundred feet high-  Dark, oily water  repeated Cuthbert.  Now what do you suppose that means  Whoever it is has made a rum job of it     Odd how the other voice runs along like a sort of accompanintent to yours, isn t it    remarked the secretary.  Now, if Grimes had been monkeying with the ma- chine he wouldn t be talking about  dark, oily water  it would more likely be rum. It s got me guessing.  They continued to run the needle slowly over the roll, and by so doing had no diffi- culty in dissecting out Cuthbert s original account of the ambushing of the 127th. This literary palimpsest Bathurst tran- scribed in short-hand. The matter super- imposed remained practically unintelligi- ble. Now and then, when Cuthbcrt s voice paused at a punctuation mark, the other tones would continue, and they could catch certain disconnected words and phrases.  Natives  and  niggers  were constantly repeated. There was a good deal about  quinine,   huts,   black, oily water  or  dark, oily water,  and  roots  also a person named   Walchheim,  or something of the sort. Cuthbert gave it up after having wasted a full hour in his endeavor to identify the voice of the culprit. The peculiar feature of the incident was that the only persons who had access to the studv, which directly adjoined the bedroom and The Other Man 411 opened on the veranda, were Grimes, the orderly, and Cuthbert s native servant. Of course it was conceivable that one of his brother officers might have dropped in and amused himself by talking into the ma- chine, yet it seemed hardly likely that he would have gone on so long for the roll was full of what Bathurst called  the accompaniment.  But the voice was so low and so muffled that the task of identi- fication proved hopeless. On the crest of the hill beyond the polo field on the way back from their canter up the valley, with his horse sharply silhou- etted against the dying sunset, Cuthbert told Mary Stanley lhat he loved her, and she listened, sitting silently beside him until he had told her all that he had to say, for she respected him above all men that she had known, lt was no boyish out- burst, but the restrained declaration of a man s heart. He told her of his lonely orphaned boyhood, of his supersensitive- ness at school, of the poverty which had constantly harassed him at college, of his grinding years of service in India, of his un- remitting study of llie art of war which seemed to bear no fruit except the cold and merely formal acknowledgment of his pub- lished work and the ill-concealed resent- ment of his superiors. He told her these things, not to excite her sympathy, but as facts which the woman to whom he was offering his love should know. Mary Stanley heard him on the verge of tears. She knew that all this strong man needed was just the sort of affection and comrade- ship that she could give. It wasn t the grind as he said but the loneliness of the future, the hopelessness of life without her. Yet, even though she might have wished to give herself to him, she could not. To tell him this was the task for which she had pre- pared herself all during the long night and the longer day just passed. For a man s ghost hardly, more stood between them,  the dear, weak, passionate wailing ghost of another man, who had loved her with the wild, recklcss love of his dark-eyed race, who had wet her shoulder with his tears, and who might All  dear God    who might come back. Cuthbert heard what might have been without a word, but the pony felt his frame quiver and turned her head until the white half-moon of her eye looked inquiringly into his, for this dumb brute loved him even as that other man loved Mary Stanley, and knew by the pressure of his knees and the poise of his body whether her master felt well or ill, and the joy of her life  a joy so keen that the green earth seemed to reach up to the blue sky in an ecstasy of delight  was when, mallet in hand, her lord whis- pered in her car and she raced with him after the white ball across the field below.  It is getting dark,  said Mary Stanlev,  We must be going home.  Captain Cuthbert bent his head.  It will always be dark,  he could not help saying.  And 1 shall have no home  without you.   The same thing s happened again.  said Bathurst the next morning.  Your last roll is ruined. I can't make a thing out of it. Somebody has come in again and talked himself blue in the face.  He looked at Cuthbert in a half-alarmed way, as if he thought the Captain might hold him responsible.  I ve had a heart-to- heart talk with Grimes, and he swears he hasn t even touched the machine and of course Mokee couldn t have done it. I begin to think the blooming thing s hoo- dooed. Funny isn t it   Cuthbert looked at the boy sharply. It was quite inconceivable that this timid vouth had been attempting a practical joke. It would have been too costlv. Besides the Captain had locked the doors of both his bedroom and study, and no one had had access to the machine since he had finished dictating the afternoon before.  Can you make anything out of it   he asked gently.  Oh, it s worse than ever,'' answered the secretary.   I can hardly hear vour stuff - excuse me, sir. your dictation at all. The whole thing is like a dog-fight with some gibberish about  heat,   canoes  and   ivorv,  like yesterday. I say it s uncanny   He wiped his forehead and looked despairingly at Cuthbert. When the captain finished his dictating that afternoon he removed the roll last used and substituted for it a fresh one from a hitherto unopened box recently arrived from Calcutta. No human tone had ever made an impression upon its glossy surface. He had just received a little note from Miss The Other Man Sianlcv sav inn l li ii t she wa    ii i ,n awav fur a mx weeks  visit, and his heart was biller. That night I f i lost-il ihe windows   1 ihe bungalow, arid across the open door lead- ing In ihe veranda he lied liils ol thread I'nmiei'ted with empty boiile- upon the table. But Ids rest, save for his own night- marish dreams, was undislurl ed. lie sle  l late, hut arose uim-fre hed. Knit-ring his - tin    ', he saw that 110 one had been I here. The threads across the door were undis- turbed All was as he had let I il. There would be no more pra  lical jokes on the   art of his i nmrades or meddling bv ser- vants. Then something about ihe graph ophone attracted his attention. He saw that the needle, instead of resting upon llie left i if the roll, was at I he extreme right, and the roll itself was covered with the gossa- mer parings made in use. Somebody Inn  been talking into the machine  Cuthbert stood staring al il unable lo trast his eves. Then with a grim laugh he removed the needle and. throwing il back to the left of the roll, took his customary seat and set the graphophone in motion. Hi- own voice issued from the trumpet   his   :cn I'nirr, l'aml ling and indistinct. " This   must   be   Augu-l   eleventh," il said. "1 got th.it right, anyway." Cuthbert muttered lo liimsch, lm- llu calendar date w as, in fai I, August t i . "This must be August eleventh, for Bombah savs he has made sixteen notches in hi- -tic k sini e we met the Dutchman, and that w;.s the twcnlv-six.h of  ulv.

The voice ceased and the needle scraped along over an untouched surface. Cuth- bert gnawed his moustache in impotent annoyance. Why didn t the thing go on  He had the feeling of one who, standing on a wharf, sees a boat slowly receding out of reach. The fellow was sick, you could easily tell that. Perhaps he would die. But he was game not to take the drink  A great feeling of sympathy for this miserable wretch took hold of him. If he could only do something  Why, he wondered, should this strange message come to so unrelated a human being as himself  Why was he made the recipient of this tale of suffering  He wandered around wretchedly all that day. The officers and officers  wives wondered what was the matter with him. He had been harder hit than they had supposed. That night again he invited intercourse with his unseen correspondent, but again sleep deserted him. Then once more the machine spoke. This time it simply raved incoherently, wandering on and on about Dublin and Watchheim, the Arab woman and the ever-buzzing flies. At times the man talked of his trip up the river through the black, reeking shadows of the Congo; again his ravings were of some woman to whom he had made a promise. Once a fierce craving for alcohol came upon him, and he cursed horribly the fate that had left him dying on an ice-cold island among a multitude of niggers. Then the mutterings would cease from weakness, apparently. Cuthbert played his strange game night after night the strangest game he had ever known. For a week or more he played it, while the man in the swamp raved and gib- bered with fever, and then one morning the voice from the machine spoke ration- all   and clear.   I have been dreadfully ill. God knows how I have pulled through, but my quinine is all gone. I am so weak that I can hardly crawl. I asked after the Dutchman and Bombah says that he died yesterday The men in the iron collars have gone, leaving the ivory. There is something the matter with  he natives. They are shouting and yelling like demons. They will not bury the Dutchman, saying that his body is taboo. The witch doctor with his skulls was dancing around mv tent last night, and I have just driven him off with my rifle. I am wondering what is to become of the Arab woman and Watchheim s ivory. Bombah has come back with some of the Dutchman s papers. I gather from them that the ivory must belong to King Leopold. Bombah says that the bearers are urging my men to join with them in murdering me and stealing the ivory and the Arab woman. She refuses to leave the Dutchman s body. The natives say the island is accursed, that my medicines turn men into beasts, and that I am a devil. Bombah is terribly afraid. The heat is terrible.

Cuthbert passed the next day in an agony of apprehension, and, a wreck from ner- vous fatigue, cast himself upon his cot by nine o clock that evening. It was a still, softly clear night with a waning moon. He awoke to find himself sitting in his pajamas before the machine, his foot on the treadle, the sweat pouring from his body. Throw- ing the needle back to the beginning of the roll, he listened to his own voice with star- tled eyes.  It is coming I know it. There is a bonfire blazing among the huts, and the niggers are dancing around it shrieking. Bombah has disappeared.

Barnum, bv sonic misi ah illation of Some Musical Recollections of Fifty Years the floor space, had sold many hundred more tickets than the place would hold, and the result was one of the most enraged crowds I ever beheld. I arrived rather late at the hall, and not being able to find any rear door to the stage, 1 had lo explain my situation to the police at the entrance, and by their aid managed to get inside the doors. The aisles were so blocked with people that it was simply impossible to make any progress, and il was finally sug- gested by some enterprising man that I should be lifted up and passed over the heads of the people until I reached the stage. It was not unlike being tossed in a blanket, but I was a youth of slim pro- portions and finally reached the footlights rather more dead than alive, and very much disordered in my general appearance. I was put together, however, and took my place on the programme without causing any delay. I think this was the only time when a concert was given in a railway sta- tion; a place more obviously unsuited to a musical occasion could hardly have been devised, and we were all indignant al the management for transferring us thither from Tremont Temple, where the previous concerts had been given. Jenny Lind made many warm friends in this country, and it was at the house of Mr. Samuel Ward, of Boston, that her marriage with Otto Goldschmidt was solemnized by Doctor  afterward Bishop  Wainwright. She always retained a sincere regard for the American character and some extracts from one of her letters will show how truly she appreciated all that was best in our people, although she was in no wise blind to their undeveloped artistic tastes nor the unusual methods of her impresario. It is addressed to Joseph Burke, with whom she kept up a desultory correspondence for many years, and whom she was ever ready to welcome to her home near London when chance led him to visit the Old World.  Dresden, 17 Fchy, 185.;.  My Dear Friend: It was with a very great pleasure that I received and read your kind, friendly letter of the 1st of Jan- uary, and many thoughts wandered through my head when I reflected upon the many changes that have taken place since our first New Year s Eve together in Charles- ton  It is a beautiful thing in life to find Persons we can esteem and feci friendship lor, and you are certainly one of those who have many times cheered me and made me to believe in solid friendship, and 1 for my part shall always feel interested in your welfare and happiness.  I often think of America, it is the new world that is true; there is active life and room to lake breath, while Europe is old, quite a Grandmother to the rest of the world. Here are thousands of beautiful things certainly, and life in Europe is rich and full of - rl and Poetry, but except Eng- land there is here everywhere great in- fidelity, great want of moral activity. Peo- ple here mostly misunderstand life s claim, object, and end and this makes me to feel a stranger. Surrounded though I am by Kind People I feel already as if I was to spend my whole life in Germany, my soul and my faculties would remain undevel- oped for want of such examples as 1 have seen in England and in America, and yet how many good qualities do the Germans possess, but the Pride makes them .blind  and Pride is our greatest ;.nd most dan- gerous Joe.  We are thank God very well, but I have nevertheless been obliged to make up my mind n: t to sing at all  I mean in pub- lic  this winter for indeed my head and my nerves wanted rest if I am to regain my former Powers once more. America, the anxiety 1 experienced there every time I sang to a Barnumish' House  you will un- derstand all 1 mean with that only word  has put me down very considerably and my whole iron constitution was necessary to resist as Well as I did. The tranquility I enjoy now does me much good I feel, and my voice is in perfect order, so that it is a great sacrifice for me not to sing.  That you did not go to California was in my opinion very wise, you would have regretted your voyage I fear. And Miss Barnum married  She is a good-hearted Person, may she have found the man that can make her happy    I wished that you had some nice raison- able Pupils that could cheer you up in your fatiguant lessons as a Music Teacher, but I know well from experience how seldom one finds a little more than commonplace medi- ocrity in the musical geniuses of the Family celebrities  I remember your playing like that great Pianist with the chromatic pas- 432 Some Musical Recollections of Fifty Years sage with the right hand, how vve used to laugh then.

He is to a very high degree violent in liis temper, and only hard cir- cumstances will put him down. Our education in London is so foolish, that instead of smoothing down our by nature volcanic, they do all they can to tune us up still higher, and this is a great misfortune.   Mr. Goldschmidt begs me to send you his best compliments, he continues to make justice to my opinion of a true, uninterested friend of mine, he is very kind and faithful to me, bears with great patience and mild- ness my many infirmities, and my impul- sive nature gets smoothed by his equal and dignified temper. God bless and lead him on in the right way, as I have every reason lo love and respect him.

Another letter from Sir Julius Benedict seems to show that he, too, had formed some pleasant friendships on our shores and carried back with him agreeable mem- ories of his visit to our country.  2 Manchester Square, London,  31st March, 1856.  Dear Burke: I have been so much occupied of late that I could not immediate- ly answer your kind letter of last month, but I can assure you I am quite happy to think that you have not forgotten your old friend. I delivered your note to Madame Gold- schmidt who as well as her husband and my Godchild are in excellent health and spirits. Their success is even greater than in 1847 and 1848. The receipts of the concerts can only be compared with the best in the United States, and instead of flagging the excitement is on the increase. They have now left for a tour in the provinces of 7 to 8 weeks, with Ernst and Piatti, but this being the busiest time for me I could not accompany them; I expect them, however, back about the 10th of May, and they then will perform again for the first time at my concert on Wednesday, May 21st. You have heard no doubt of the burning of Covent Garden Theatre. Lumley is to open early in May with Bottesini as Musi- cal Director, Albertina, Piccolomini, Viar- dot as I rima Donnas.

So much has been written of the wonder- ful tour of Jenny Lind through the I nited States that it would seem as if nothing more was left to be said. Her triumphs and her charities went hand in hand, and a quotation from Rosenberg s book, now out of print, describing her first year in this country will show in what high esteem she was held by every one:  She must not be estimated alone as the greatest vocalist who has ever appeared before the lovers of melody on these shores, or on those of Eu- rope. She is essentially one of the noblest, most self-denying and most charitable of living women. None who have met her and known her can doubt this, as none with whom she has at any time been connected can fail of appreciating her warm and kind- ly nature.  The people of New York and Boston had received a strong musical impulse from the Lind concerts, and it was not astonishing to find them ready to extend as warm, if not as excited, a reception to Thalberg as they had to Jenny Lind. He was not managed by such a showman as P. T. Barnum but he was well heralded by Ullmann, and I dis- tinctly remember the intense curiosity with which the audience awaited his first per- formance in Niblo s concert room in the autumn of 1855. He was the first really great pianist of European fame to come to this country, and he was known to have divided the honors and opinions of the old world with Liszt himself. It is true De Meyer had been here and had in turn as- tonished and charmed his audiences by his immense  tours de force  and his delicate touch, while Gottschalk, fresh from his Parisian triumphs, had also been heard and admired, but the colossal reputation of a Thalberg had worked up the pitch of ex- pectancy to fever heat. 11 was not a trifling incident of the day car week to go to one of these concerts,but a much-coveted privilege eagerly sought for and anticipated as a rare treat. At the matinees, always largely at- tended by ladies, quite a social feature was added by the serving of tea and light con- fectionery during the entr actes. Thalberg was immensely successful, giv - ing as many as three concerts in a day, one in the morning and evening in New York, and a third in the afternoon in Brooklyn. His repertoire consisted only of about twelve of his own fantasias, but these were played with absolute perfection. There is no doubt that the great players of the last generation were much more perfect in technical finish than those of the present time who play everything from Bach to Liszt. Thalberg was wise enough to avoid all compositions which he felt did not be- long to his peculiar genre; he did not en- croach upon the classics, and consequently he never scored any failures. He knew his limitations, but he did not allow others to discover them. He was satisfied to be suc- cessful in his own compositions, which still remain the best operatic transcriptions ex- tant. His perfect virtuosity was the result of untiring labor. Vincent Wallace once told me that he had heard him practise two bars of his  Don Pasquale Fantasia  in the octave variation on the Serenade for a whole night, never leaving the piano until sunrise. I gave my warmest sympathy to Wallace, but I confess to have enjoyed very keenly the result of the night s work. 1 I.If Some Musical Rccollccti  ns ol l  fly   cats IS47 X,. -t; -     r$'S - TCSTIMOMAI.

The northern rampart was broader than the promenade of the Brooklyn Bridge, and along it a man was pacing with a soldierly stride, as if for exercise. He stopped at sight of the aeroplane and waved his hand- kerchief, less in signal, it seemed, than in greeting to the ghostly visitor of the night. The Falcon's runners screeched over the deplaced stones and dipped in holes where the masonry had worn away; but she was brought to a stand-still without injury to her brittle and complicated fabric. The man came running toward the spot. He was about twenty-four, tall and fair-haired. His surprise at the visitation was too com- plete and unaffected for him to have been a party to any prior arrangement. Roddte wonder at this hastened him abruptly to his question.   Would you like a flight    he asked.  'Would I  After wearing out boot- leather for two months on these rocks, would I  But we d better be quick. Here comes Major von Hoffman, my chief jailer   He pointed toward a portly figure in uniform which struggled to the top of the rampart and then came stumbling and panting in their direction. The Falcon shot fairly over the head of the Major, who waved his hands and shouted something about His Majesty s in- junctions and his own honor, which was lost forever, and then sank on a ledge, a veritable lump of dejection.   It is the American, Mr. Rodd, isn t it    asked the passenger.   And in passing you saw a poor, miserable devil pacing up and down and thought you would give him an evening abroad in Vienna, perhaps  No  don t make it Vienna  There s another place I want to go.

No   The young man frowned. He was becoming urgently apprehensive.  Who sent you  What is the ruse   he de- manded. But Rodd was busy opening note num- ber two.   You will proceed to the forester s lodge of the Von Luttgen estate,  it said.   Ask your passenger the way. If the Countess Sophia Von Luttgen is waiting for you there, please make a place for her in the Falcon. When you have her and the young man aloft, you may open the third note.  Rodd folded number two and slipped it carefully into his pocket with number one, considering both too vialuable mementos to be lost.   I am to take you to the forester s lodge of the Von Liittgen estate.    To Sophia   cried the young man. He seemed to have added a foot in stature, composed of pure ecstasy.  To Sophia  I don t care what the ruse is or who sent you if I am to see her    "Do you know the way   asked Rodd laconically.

"The Countess Royal understands her game, evidently,  Rodd thought,  and I see only the backs of the cards until it pleases her to play them. Ich dienl  From landmark to landmark, now a church tower of a hill-side village, now a city, now a bridge over a stream, the pas- senger, his eyes ardent and shrewd with a knowledge of the topography that seemed bred in the bone, laid the course. For him the glory of flight was incident to its speed. Fields and trees spinning by meant miles that were past, minutes of impatient wait- ing ticked off the clock.

As near as you can to that light. It is the lodge   said the young man. Beside the woodland path, under the shadow of the trees, on a mat of pine needles sweet with the aroma drawn by the moisture of dew, the Falcon came softly to rest, like some soaring thing which defied nature s clumsy fluttering of wings.   You did not say that Sophia was there. You only said to go to the lodge   ex- claimed the young man suddenly, as if preparing himself for a disappointment A Might liir the C_ i m11trss In.    .11 wlmse possibility had, Inr the- lirsl lime, crossed his mind.

The summer life at Onteora has brought the artist into contact with tlie village wor- thies, one of whom furnished the model for "TheBlacksmith   pagc.458 , done in iqoq. This typical follower of the ancient craft stands, in his leather apron, and looks out at us inquiringly over his spectacles before finishing the horseshoe held with tongs on the anvil. The sincerity of the character- ization and the carefully treated details interest us no less than the rich color qualities of the forge-burned face seen under the reflecting lights of the smithy. Educated in the classic atmosphere of the  Beaux-Arts,  and with a natural idealism, Beckwith has painted a number of symbolic studies, often depending for their interest on the delicate beauty of the female face and figure. In  La Cigale   page 452 , .1 subject taken from Lafontaine s fable, we have the decoratively composed head arid bust of a blonde, girlish type seen in pro llle, with clasped hands drawn to the left shoul- der, shivering under the fall of the first win- try snowflakes. The N.iutilu-,  "Danse Antique,   The Awakening,  and other works of a similar character, served by Beckwith s remarkable skill in figure-draw- ing and most const ientiously  minted, have perhaps been less appreciated here than would have been the case in France and Europe. The concrete qualities of his portraits seem, thus far, to have been pre- ferred to the more fanciful creations of his brush. Vet. having seen the dome at the Liberal Arts Building at the Chicago Ex- position which Beckwith decorated to the glory of electricity, one can but regret the seeming vandalism that caused it, with other interesting works there, to fall under the wrecker s axe. The sprightly genius producing a forked flash at the apex of the dome was supported in the four penden- tives by female figures typifying the dy- namo, the arc light, the telegraph, and the telephone. It was an essay in the idealiza- tion   f actualities that might 1  e well worth at- tempting again in a more permanent form. The dignified portrait of I  r.

The portrait, ton, of Miss Luidta Leland, lately shown at Knoedler's  1 allcries, in which the l road lighting of the face and shoulders is relieved I     ihe deep notes i t the corsage and sparkling idle  tions from the eyes and bejewelled coilfure, is an- other recent and typical presentment. But it is not possible here to make anything like a complete list of the portraits and pictures done during the past thirty or more years. Whatever restrii live criticism might be invoked and no human produc- tion has ever been spared in a final analysis  Beckwith's works have been marked" bv r distinction that is personal; and refine- ment of torm, color, and expression have especially appealed to him. Refusing to follow every new fashion in painting, he I as remained true to his own convictions so that early and later works indicate a i hara  teristic identity of aim. Basing his an on the best   lassical models,an exquisite t.istc joined to a tireless energy has cer- tainly contributed o his success, especially I  r Henry I arks Wright in portraiture, and it has often been said that the most satisfying works of art the past has left us are portraits. The facts of tlie artist s earlier life may he briefly recalled. He was born on the twenty-third of September, 1.852, at Han- nibal Missouri, where his parents, origi- nally from the Fast, spent some years. A return was made to Chicago, where the great lire of 1871. in altering the family fortunes, decided his father to permit him to pursue the chosen profession of art. His mother, still remembered as a woman of great charm, sympathized with these ambi- tions, and beginning his studies as early as 1868 in Chicago under Walter Shirlaw. he came later to New York, and worked under Professor Wilmarlh at the National Wad- emy schools till his departure for Paris in October, 1S73. There, entering the fa- mous  cours Yvon " at the Beaux-Arts, he soon took up portrait-painting under Ca- rolus Duran, and in the atelier made the acquaintance of his fellow-student John I he Portraits of Carroll Beckwith Sargent. The two young artists took a studio together at 7 ; rue Notre l ame des Champs, where lliev worked during the four succeeding years. Alter the exposi- tion of rN;S Beckwith returned to America, hut he has made frequent  ummer trips to 1 11 rope for the study of his favorite masters. He was married in 1SS7 lo Miss Berlha Ilall, daughter of a prominent New York men hant. Mrs. Beckwith's full-length por- trait, in furs and bonnet, represented the artist at ihe Paris Kxposition of 1900, and now adorns his studio. Honors, public and private, have often lieen conferred upon him. He is a Na- tional Academician, and was one of the original members of the Society of Ameri- can Artists. President of the Free Art League, he believes that a better educated public and a more ex  client skill are all the protection desired by the true artist. As- sociated with these and various duhs and organizations in New York, he has never failed to uphold the cause of art and artists with unswerving loyalty. Though absorbed by many interests each day sees him take up his palette and brushes with as keen an enthusiasm as at- tended his earliest effort. The pursuitof an ideal makes  each morrow a new morn." and certain canvases on which he is now engaged encourage the hope that the must interesting phase of his art rr.ay he vet to come. .1   lui Murray Mitchell R K S T 1 I A R R  3 W A I '    M I'.

'n moved to utter herself bv the extreme   arelessiiess of Ingram whether she did so or not. The b 1 anu  ll it i to Im- laid must be upon her mother when she, knowing Ingram's storv oi miserable marriage and separation, al- lowed the rnan to continue a friend of the house, be mm h with her girl, and unfold himself under her t lear voung eves.

Ingram, a squire and son of squires, was perhaps a shade above her de- gree; she mav have required him to give a tone. This, considering that wretched marriage of his  a month's engagement in deliam e of head-shaking, a blazing Han- over Square wedding, a year's bickering, ore month's acrimony  done by letter  and Ingram s unquenc liable hatred   l the wom- an this, 1 say, you may well doubt. But I ran give no other explanation. He came, he talked in his high-voicc'l, querulous, bitter-humored way, he saw and sought the grave voting Sanchia, and he won her pit- yi ag heart direi tly he had engrossed her watching eyes. She was a girl, intensely interested in a hundred daw ning things, to whom love had come late. Until she w as near twenty you would have thought her sexless. Senhouse, her poetical friend and teacher her only friend, her only confidant dubbed her Ar- temis: and it may well have been his ador- ing service of her pure flame which first turned it inward to scorch her heart. All that she learned of this scholar gypsy she poured out as balm over the stricken In- gram, w ho swallowed it and her together. Then the truth about him was blared upon her suddenly, and she found that he was to be pitied. Guileless victim of a hateful w oman as she believed him then, she found that she held a store of balm. She pitied him deeplv, she opened, she poured out her treasure. Lnthusiasm for the saving work captained her thereafter; nothing would turn her from her purpose. Ingram was to be saved b  love; she gave him all. I o do him justice, a young man barn to possess and   oinmaid, he did his best to re- pair what was beyond repair. He told her the truth unasked by her; he confessed that he loved her, and owned that he had no business to do it. Nearness, circumstance, I  r     ding i m that w lit h w as true to 1 ioth of them and must not be uttered bv either, did II ie rest. Upon that evening in the draw- ing-room w hen tliev had found themselves alone, eat h trembling under the god, they simply drilled together, and without effort to resist, mingled their natures through the lips. Discovery, earthquake and eclipse, her mother's i hill rage, her father's tears, her sisters' dismay: all this and more she Rest Harrow 463 endured. She passioned like a young mar- tyr. She admitted the facts without com- ment and accepted the consequences with- out a falter. They might have whelmed a greater heart than hers; turned on to the town, at two-and-twenty, a girl with theface and figure of a goddess, with fifty pounds between her and the devil. They might have sent her, at the least, weeping and trembling into IngTam s arms. But they did not. She was of finer clay. She took a lodging in Pimlico, and, to fit herself for employment, went to school. The com- mercial course which she chose was the shortest possible, but all that she felt she could afford.   My dear young lady, we can only promise you a smattering really no more for the money.    It must start me,  said Sanchia, and began. There was a month to run when Ingram found her, and glad as she was of him, doting and doted upon, in the first flood of youth and love, she persisted in it, finished it out, and got her diploma for what it was worth, before, as he put it, she would listen to reason. It sounded extremely reasonable to him, what he had proposed; and also to her, though Chevenix scorned its propounder. As Ingram put it to her, it attracted her new-born pride of knowledge. She was to flesh her steel, so to speak, in reality; in plainer words, she, with her smattering of accounts, was to manage a great house, an army of servants, possibly an estate. Excessively in love as she was, with all the music of it in her untried ears, she knew already in herself that her mind must have other food than her heart s rapture. I think she would have de- clined him altogether if he had proposed nothing more tangible to her than perpet- ual honeymoon. That was what Senhouse would have proposed to her she saw that in every look of his, and read it in every- line he sent her; but that had never attracted her. She had given Senhouse her con- fidence, but not yet her heart. Ingram's proposals, therefore, pleased her. She had not a sweet enough tooth, nor the taste for flattery which the other involved. She was entirely without vanity. Therefore, how- ever little honorable and however much a lover of his ease Ingram may have shown himself in making them, his reasonable pro- posals were gratefully received. It was he who suggested, but she who took the lead. She began immediately to plan her new career; was perfectly businesslike. Ingram was to leave London at once, and go to Wanless to his duties of the bench, his delights of the field, cares of the farm. He was to announce to his household his in- tention of  settling down ; and he was to announce the advent of a housekeeper. In the very outset of his bliss he must needs do as she bade him. He went, and made her ways as smooth as they could be made. Her rooms were assigned to her; her duties mapped out, the exact range of her au- thority. Her wages were fixed, to be paid quarterly. She would take nothing else from him no jewellery  she wore nothing but simple things, which had been given her by her parents or sisters amber, a string of cowries, an agate heart, a bangle or two , no frocks. She was to have two hundred a year, and throughout her time to this pres- ent she had no more, and kept herself ex- quisitely upon it, with a sense of what was due to him, to herself, and to her position, which was admirable, unhesitating, and never at fault. In due time she arrived and entered upon her career. That which was unlawful seemed now justified; the secret intimacy, the wedded amity, the giving which was the dearest gain she had. Dis- cretion, on her side unsleeping, on his the more effective because he never seemed to have any, secured them. There was no scandal among the neighbors; whatever the household may have suspected, very little was said. Within a year the servants were her slaves. The rector, it is true, re- proached her for not going to church. She deprecated his indignation, but didn t go. Up to the day when we first met with her, her garden-hat in her hand, reading her telegram by the garden window, she had been eight years governor of Wanless and for nearly two of those years alone. For the first two or three of them Ingram, revel- ling in his snug ease, with little to do but devise things alterations, extensions, vent- ures into farming, and the like, which it was her delight to execute never left the county, hardly cared to leave the estate. He entertained very sparingly; Chevenix came once or twice, his own brother, Max- well Ingram; there were some dinner- parties to the countryside, hunt breakfasts, once a hunt ball. lie endured these weari- nesses, shrugging them away as soon as he Rest Harrow could, to hasten from a dinner of dry toast and knives and forks to his room the mas- ter s room where supper. Sanchia, sweet intimacy awaited him. He spent thus by far the cleanliest and most sane years of his wayward life. She soothed, amused, stimulated him at once. Me taught her all he knew of country lore, gave her, as they say,   the hang  of landed estate; he learned by teaching: he might have ljecome a whole- some gentleman. But domestic business called him to Lon- don presently. He went, and was away three months, w ith lawyers, fierce threaten ings from Claire, intermediaries, friends of both parties and the rest of them. Me was worried. Hurried, put into a rage; exploded, put himsei.' a thousand times in the wrong; finally he came hack to Wanless embittered and restless. He came back n   find himself welcome, hut not excessively so. At least, he thought not. Mis extensions, suggested in that first wonderful time a range of glass-houses, new heating apparatus, acety- lene-gas installations were well advanced. Sanchia s brows were often knit over esti- mates. specifications, and bills. He had to pay fur novelties from which the salt had evaporated; he was never very fond of pay- ing, and now, it seemed, he wasn't very fond of what he had to pay for. Sanchia was kind to him, but there was a difference. She w as as happv as the day washing, alwavsat work,outdoors or in, had not a moment for him  business apart  until the very end of the day, when  at eleven or so  she dressed with care and went to him at his supper. Sanchia was perfectly happv. but he was in  t. Me stayed six months that year from April to September but then went to Scot- land. deer-stalking, shooting pheasants. He was back for Christmas and brought a houselul of guests all men. Again she welcomed him, again she was kind. He was now' a liitle blunted to ihe fine shades of Love tonk his happiness as it happened to come, and could rub his hands over the household blessing she was. Bv and bv. at the end of her fourth year, she took over the gardens as well as the house, was ac- cepted by Mr. Menzies as his liege ladv, and by young  ilvde as much more than that. The estate management: home farm, woods, tenancies, were given up to her at the end of the lilth year, just before Ingram sailed for West Africa on a shooting expe- dition. By that time he had grown to de- pend upon her entirely for everything. She was become the faithful, well-tried wife of standing, which in a man of Ingram's bone means that nothing remained of love but en- tire confidence and occasional gratification. After this he left her for long periods to- gether; for the whole of the eighth year he was abroad,   idiotically happy,  as he had told her. During all this time no intercourse with her family except those furtive letters from her adoring old father, which were pitiful to her, because they could not he answered as he would have had them: and nothing from her friend of the Open, who had at last got himself a mate. It seemed that she had made a clean break, and that nothing of what had made her dawning life sweet and sane was to mingle with the sweetness and sanity which she had brought into Wtnless. And then after six years she caught herself looking back. And now here was an end of the dream. If you are to ask me what had changed her regard for Ingram during that solitary year, so that she received him at the end of it as she did, I don t know that I can tell you all. Slowly discovery of herself, of him  came to her, slowly combustible stuff was heaped within her; it slowly kindled, and smouldered long. No doubt he himself blew it into clear llame by his let-drop news of Claire s death. She had not known that: she never read the newspaper, having neither time for the world s affairs, nor in- terest in I hem. Suddenly, by that, she was offended; suddenly saw him as he really was, always had been, and always must be. Suddenly, also, she saw herself, as brim- ming with life, energy to live, and to make live, at the end of her music time. The folds fell from her eyes, she could see In- gram as a man, squalid. Nay, more: she could see him as a beast, ravening. Soon lie gave her horror, so that she dared not look back upon her hours of blindness. Perhaps he had offended her by his silence his two letters, which she had neither invited n;ir answered. That can hardly account for it, since she had not w ritten to him of her own initiative. Their parting certainly had been discrepant; the clinging and wistfulness had been hers, though she had uttered nothing of com- Rest Harrow 465 plaint or misgiving. But perhaps he had been too gay and nonchalant, a little too much the husband sec ure. For a week she had shivered at her loneliness; then she had plunged anew into the flood of affairs, :ind had come out, as from a cold bath,braccd and tingling. Round went the wheels of Wanless. The house was new-papered, painted, carpeted. Every month brought new wonders to the garden; under Clyde s tuition, seeing with his eyes, watching with his tensity of vision, she had come closely into nature s arms. Perhaps she was un- wise with the young man: the fact is, she never stopped to consider him. She liked him and his queer, secret, passionate ways. She took a royal line of her own. She re- quired much of him, and if he made much of it, she didn t know it. She dreamed no harm to him or to herself. Pier absorption in the business of the moment, or the needs, was so manifest that not even the maids, who saw' her frequently with the youth, could have thought harm for a second. It was just Miss Percival all over as  keen as mustard.  Perhaps it was as much under Clyde s fostering as any other nur- ture that she came, during that year alone, to love the earth so well that she could ap- praise the worth of love. I don t know. It was a critical year for her. As she was anything but a fool, there's no doubt that she came, before the end of that year, to know what was the matter with Clyde. She had had experience of her- self and another and he was utterly in- capable of concealing his. Of course she knew what was the matter with him, and was tenderly and quietly amused. She ap- proached him gradually, let herself play elder sister, and let him play what he chose, within severe limits, never overstepped by him, never unwatched by herself. He was a passionate, sensitive,inarticulate creature, hatchet-faced, gypsy-looking, sharp-eyed, scowling and thin. He always looked cold, mostly angry, and never seemed contented, even when his plants flowered themselves to death to please him. A woman, any woman, knowing that a man covets her possession, stores her knowl- edge, exults in it in secret. It is a fund, a store against lean years or wry ones. You can see it throned sedately in her eyes when she is with him, however much she may feel his absurdity or presumption. So it was with her. She was fully conscious of Struan s preposterous state, strictly the elder sister never the patroness, for were they not bond-slaves both   She patronized nobody at Wanless, yet, with a steady eye for distances, kept a perfect length, varying with each comer. With Mr. Menzies, lord of the gardens, so far on she came; with Frodsham, master of horse and hound, so far; with the engineer so far; with Minnie nearer; nearest of all with Mrs. Benson: her attitude to the stout woman was that of favorite pupil with a family governess of immemorial service. She could wheedle Mrs. Benson, and often did. The elder sis- ter attitude was kept for young Clyde; she admonished, scolded, preached to him high doctrine of duty and honor; there was some- thing benignant, a sort of pitying care shed from above. To him she may have been like Cynthia, stooping to the dreamer on Latmos. Whether she knew that, she must have known a good deal. She knew, for instance, that he kept vigil; for she had met him at night, as you have been told. She knew where to find him. Nothing had ever passed between them, of course, of her relations with the master. I don t think that she was aware of his sentry-go under the windows first under Ingram s, then under hers. T am sure she was not, or he would have heard of it in plain terms, have seen her eyes grow cruel, and her mouth stretch to bleakness. She was capable of royal rage when she was offended. But that he hated Ingram must have been plain to her. But now, as she stood al gaze, lonely and pensive by the black pond, she saw that it was over, her busy life. She was at the end of her tether, must lose her power and the seuse of it. She was to begin the world again, starting with her fifty pounds, and without that which had made it a pride before. With a little shiver of self-pity, a half sigh, and a tightening of the lips, she ac- cepted her fate. That was her way. She regretted nothing, asked neither for mercy nor allowance. What she had done, she had done; if it was to be done with, she could not help that; she must go her way. Never for an instant did it enter her head that she could marry Ingram. Nothing that he had urged, or Chevenix counselled, made the smallest difference to her. She did not love Nevile any more; he was hor- Rest Harrow rii le to her: enough o  that.    hatevcr Iut laic was to la-, she would accept it; she i hose it so. Without reasoning it out, that wa' final fir her. She had always had wV :olo for her linal cause, Shi pro ralione voluntas. Marriage, even nominal mar- riage, with Xevile was the accursed thing; noneofit. And why  Because she chose it so. This is verv mi I   lime. 1 sing, or M r.

Sanchia, with rueful eyes, feared that this was her fault. " Pm very sorry,  she said.     n all accounts I m very sorry. I shall miss you. It was nii e to see you again.  "See me again.  cried Chevenix,  as soon as vmi please; but not here unless you feel you can make up your mind to settle down, as we c all it.  She shook her head. " I don t think I can. I think it might be wicked as things are.  Chevenix raised his eyebrows.  That s you all over, my dear. Other people's right i.  your w rong.

And I gave myself away confound- edly to each of 'em in turn. That s rather a bore. I was counting on him, you know. I thought you might want him.  Sanchia made no reply. About the cor- ners of her mouth there lurked the hint of a smile, which her wistful eyes belied. Chev- enix watched her, but could make nothing of it.  He was a rum  un,  he continued.   The first time I saw him after you came up here was when I ran against him by chance in Norfolk somewhere. Spread abroad he was in flannels all his things strewn about. He had a little fire going, and a little pot on it. Doing a job of tink- ering, he said, to oblige a lady. There was the lady, too, if you please, sitting on a bank, smoking a clay. She had a beard, and an old wide-awake on her head. Senhouse in- troduced me, I remember. He told me he was on his way north Wastwater, I think. A planting job up there or something.

He said,   My dear sir, I don t ask you what she is doing or where she is. I ask you if she is well.  Then I told him a lot about you and Neviie, and all this business. I let out, I tell you. I was fairly deep in the thing  you know that I felt pretty badly, because it was my fault that you ever knew Nevile at all. Don t you suppose I ve ever forgiven myself that, Sancie; never you suppose it. No, no.  He was much moved. She, by a sudden impulse, put out her hand to him. He wrung it, and said,  Thanks, Sancie; thanks, my dear.  After a wrestling bout, he went on.   Do you know what that fellow said to me   I should like you to know it. Mind you, he was yours, body and soul, then whatever he may be now. I think he s yours still, for that matter but then  He never con- cealed it so far as I know from anybody. Now, listen to me. He heard me out, never said anything till I d done. Then he looked out over the marshes into the weather, and he said,  No harm ever came to a good woman. I shall see her again, crowned  Now, what do you say to that  Queer, isn t it   Sanchia blushed deeply and bent her head. Chevenix marked her confusion, and varied his tone to suit the case. He be- came practical.   Now what ll he say about this new state of affairs, do you suppose   She lifted her head.  He will think me in the right.  Chevenix shrugged.  There s going to be trouble,  he believed.  There s bound to be, just on that account. Nevile can be a brute when he s in the wrong, and knows it.  Sanchia squared her jaw for the trouble.   He wants you back, you know, awfully  because you won t come. And the more he wants you the less he ll say so. That s the pride of the cobbler s dog. If he s un- comfortable, he ll scratch until he s com- fortable again. And he says,   If you can t get the best, take the next best,  and runs about with Mrs. Wilmot at his heels, and is bored all the time. That s Nevile all over.  His eyes grew rounder.   You ll have to go, you know.  She admitted that.   Yes, I must.  Then she sighed.   I don t want to go. There s such a lot to be done here.   Yes, yes, my dear,  said Chevenix with some irritation.   No doubt there is. But you can t afford it.  He stammered out his next.   I should like to say, Sancie, that there s nobody on earth I respect for whom I have more re- spect than for you. I don t understand your point of view don t pretend to. But I know a fine thing when I see it. I m not much of a chap, I know no brains, and all that simple, rotten chap, I know; but if we re not going to be friends I shall he un- happy.    We are, I hope,  she said, smiling kind- ly at him. She gave him her hand. Rest 11 arrow " Right. Sain ic. Look here,  lie said stern I v. " I'll   nine h N'evilc's lie ad I or you, if  'i'M like." "1 shouldn't like it at all,  she assured him.

Mrs. Wilniot remained, against her in- most judgment, against her maid Purcell's clear advit e, for one more day. The night of  'hevenix'- departure she was there, and on the morrow was to be conveyed to the Trenehards , across the county. Wanless had her steadilv in its s. ore pair of eves for twenty-four hours,as Purcell, her maid, had foreseen. " Yi u are doing a strange thing, ma'am, permit me to say." Purcell was an elderly spinster, who only required her own permission to sav vvliat she pleased. " Y"ll will be watched, and reported I suppose I .1111 not in the servants' hall for nothing."

She had murmured a gentle rebuke; her Rest Harrow 469 eyes had brimmed, reproaching him. It was then that he had taken her hand, at the going-out from the fig-house.   Ruth,  he had said,   my kind, pretty Ruth." Then he stooped his head and kissed her. Through three pairs of doors Glyde, in the peach-house, had seen the act, and paused in his spraying. It was over in a minute. The pair strolled away and passed out of the walled garden. Glyde, who had turned very white, compressed his lips and went back to his work like a machine. Pres- ently a light step made him start, look guardedly up, watch and wait. Sanchia, bare-headed, fresh and debonair, came in, like a stream of w est wind. Her eyes beamed her health and pleasure.    Oh, Struan,  she said,   do come and see the Sits tanas. They are on the very point of opening. Do come. There s nobody about. They ve gone down to the river.  He could not face her, knowing what he knew. But he could not resist her either.   I'll come,  he said, and followed her. She went gayly and eagerly.   You ve never done so well with them as this year. I counted a dozen. Huge  I felt rather miserable this morning I ve been worried rather. I thought I would just see what they would do for me. They made me feel ashamed of myself. Their strength, their contentedness just to grow', and be strong and well  Nothing more. What else ought we to want  Food the sun strength to grow  Isn t that enough    Out of the warm brown soil, sheltered by the eaves, the iris clump made a brave show. Its leaves like gray scvmitars, its great flower-stems like spears. Stiffly they reared, erect, smooth, well-rounded; and each was crowned with the swollen bud of promise. She displayed them proudly, she counted them, made him check her counting. She glowed over them, fascinated by their virile pride. Struan watched her more than her treasures. He was pale still, and bit his lip; had nothing to say. She knelt and took one of the great stalks tenderly in her hand. A kind of rapture was upon her, a mystic s ecstasy. She passed her closed hand up and down, feel- ing the stiff smoothness; she clasped and pressed the bursting bud.   Feel it, Struan, feel it,  she said.   It s alive.  He turned, shaking, away.   They say,  she went on, caressing the bud,  that this is really the Lily of the Annunciation. It s a symbol, I ve read. Gabriel held one in his hand when he stood before Our Lady. Did you know that r'  Glyde broke out.   Don t. Don t. Come away. I must speak to you quickly if I dare. Come away from here.  He spoke fiercely, meaning what he said. Grave, sobered, she arose and followed him. He drew her after him to the yew-tree walk, to the enclosure at its end, where the leaden Faun capered and grinned. There he faced her.  You must leave this place,  he said shortly. She looked to the ground.   I know,  she replied in a low voice.   Every moment you stop here insults you, puts shame upon you. Shame  And on you  It s not bearable. It s not to be suffered. I ll not suffer it, for one.  At this she lifted her head, and reproved him by a look. It wras mild, queenly mild, but not weak.

Who says I may not speak to you   Who else is to speak to you, if I don t   How can you bear your- self, and speak nothing  Is it natural   He seemed on the point of angry tears; with a gesture infinitely kind she bore with him. Her hand just touched his arm.  Dear Struan,  she said,  I know how nice you mean to be to me; I am very grate- ful to you. Of course I am going away. But I have been happy here lately, and shall be most unhappy to go. I have so many friends here.  Then, after looking at him, reflecting, she added,   Of course I know that you care.

Do you think that I ve watched you, in and out, for three years, without caring  Do you think that I have schooled myself to put up with with him without caring   And when I thought that he was coming back here to to prove himself an honorable man  I thanked the Lord.

" 1 have seen Miss 1 ercival about it, Mr. Ingram," he said. "1 saw her a week ago. And now I've got to see vou about it.   Ingram looked at him sharply a sudden stiffening of the spine: spine stiff and eyes sharp, at ting together. What he saw made him the nn .re alert.   What on earth do you mean    he asked. Rest Harrow 471  I ll tel  you,  said Glyde.   I m free of your service from this minute, so I ll tell you. I say that you are a damned scoun- drel, and that you know it.  A concentra- tion of many grudges, kept very still, as by white heat, characterized this remarkable speech. Ingram blenched.   By George, my man   he said,  you ll have to make that good.  Glyde said,  And I will. You have be- haved, you are behaving, like a dog in this house; and you re to take a dog s wages.  Ingram jumped in his saddle, rose in his stirrups.   By God   lie said,   by God   but he said no more. Glyde sprang up at him where he stood above his saddle, unseated sprang up at him. took him by the shoulders, and then, dropping, pulled him off his horse. The freed animal, started, kicked out, shook his head, and cantered freely homeward. Glyde, having Ingram on the ground, took him by the collar of his jacket and bela- bored him with his open hand. He cuffed him like a schoolboy, boxed him about the ears and face, shook him well, and then cast him into the young bracken of his own avenue.  There s for you, seducer,  he said; and that done, he walked steadily up the road, toward the lodge gates. Ingram, on his feet, in a rage which was the most manly he could have suffered, went after him at a run, and caught him up.  You blackguard   he said, and panted.  Turn and fight with me   Glyde stopped.   I ll not fight you, In- gram,  was his measured reply,   because I ve that in me which would kill you. No mercy for you there. You can do as you please; you can send me to jail or not; but you shan t get me hanged. I ve something to do with my life as much of it as you leave me; and I want it.  As Ingram glared at him, crimson now, with bulging eyes and teeth at lips, the other went on:  I m going no further to-day than my lodging. Your police will find me there when you send  em. I shan t fight them, because I can t afford it; and I shan t fight you, dog that you are, for the same reason.  Ingram cursed and sprang at him, but Glyde stiffened his arm and held it off. Master was no match for man, and felt no better for the knowledge of that. It did serve, however, to bring him to his senses. He saw that he was making an ass of him- self.  You ll hear more of this, Glyde,  he said, and turned and walked rapidly back to the house. Mortification inflamed his rage; his furi- ous walking blew into it a sense of incurable injury. Injury, shocked pride, and animal heat, all together, made a devil of him. He went directly to his room, and rang the bell.   Send Miss Percival to me;' he told Min- nie,   at once.  Then he waited for her, with a face like a rat s. XI She might have gathered warning from Minnie s panting summons, but had been busy over her accounts and had noticed nothing amiss.  He wants you, Miss Percival  Don t go   She had scarcely heard. She said,  Who wants me  Mr. Ingram  I ll come ; and through the maid s stammered   I wouldn t, oh, I wouldn t   had gone. The face he showed her from his bureau, where he sat huddled over a litter of papers, prepared her instantly for crisis; snarling, white, and wicked, yet it had tragedy in it  as if he knew that he had himself to reckon with beyond all. For some time he seemed not to see her, though he looked at her. He sat glooming, like a man dumb in high fever, working his lower jaw. screwing and unscrewing his hands. Afterwards she believed that he had been groping for the cruellest thing he could say, and was goaded into what he did say by the sense that he could find nothing.  So that was your work  Your choice way  To set one of my own servants to club me.  She looked at him blankly; but her face glowed with sudden fire.  I haven t the least notion what you mean. Who has clubbed you   His eyes flickered.  Glyde. Your friend. You seek your champions all about, it seems. You make things snug for yourself. It s master or man with you it s all one.  He spluttered his venom broadcast. She held up her head.  Are you insulting me   He wheeled round full in his chair.  Is it possible to insult you   At that she lowered her panoply of fire, 172 Rest Harrow and grew still. " I sec that ymi are. I   an t allow that.  lie foamed. "Bullies in your hire. Now 1 see what Bill Chevenix was after. And Glyde faugh  who else   She watched him steadily, without fear i  r disgust. His words held no meaning lor her.   I think you must he mad,  she said.   lt will he better if 1 go.  He scoffed at her.  Better  You are right.  He rose in his   lace.  You ll go to-dav.  Sanehia regarded him deeply, almost curiously, as il he had been a plant, inter- esting for ils rarity.   Naturally.  she said, and left him in his staring lit. The ordered little realm of Wanless went    n its diurnal course. Luncheon was served at two by a trembling parlor maid; the coffee was set in the hall, the cigar-box, the spirit-tlame. 1'rodsham came for or- ders, Mr. Menzies reported  ilyde absent without leave. These things were done by riite: yet the whole house knew the facts. Sanehia, dining in the middle of the day, plied her knife and fork with composure, ll was her way to face facts once for all, tussle with them, gain or lose, and be done with them. She had been angrv with Glyde, but now could ihink   f him as " poor Struan,  Punchinello in a rustic comedy. Of Ingram, deliberately, she thought nothing. Il had been necessary to survey her feelings nf eight years ago, to make a sour face oi disgust over them, before she could shake them out ol her head Now they were gone, and he with them: the world, with May beginning, was too sweet a place for such vermin to fester in. She had swept and ridded herself, rinsed her mouth with pure water, and now could sit to her dinner and review her plans. But the - torm burst over Wanless.

It was Bella the laundry maid she saw him from the window, and had a turn. The window was open. " Why. Struan   she said but he told her to shut mouth and eyes.  The less you see. or know,  he said,   the better for you.  Poor Struan, with his tragedy airs  Bella told that to Minnie, and that she would never forget it to her dying day. It turned the beer in her stomach, she said  and now she was lying down. As he went out of the yard, a cloud came over the sun, and Bella felt the chill. She had the goose- llesh all up her back. That, they say, be- tokens a person walking over your grave. Somewhere in England wc all have our grave-ground lying green under turf. It awaits the spade and the hour. In the morning it is green and groweth up this was Mrs. Benson's piece, but Minnie had the rest of the stage. The saddle-horse came Hinging into the yard at one o clock- no later.

" He kind to him w hen you see him again  I ilease di Mr. Menzies kiecame far-siglited. He had very blue eyes. "Ahem   he said, in his Sioteh fashion. "He ll not be here again, I dotil.it. He ll be away, the head- strong young man." But he warmed to it.    Av,  he said, "ay, Miss Pereival. For vmir sake, I'll listen to what he has to tell me.  She felt that she must be content with that. Each servant in degree must be lea 11 wilh, and Minnie comforted in her place. She was all for going that night; hut had a mother and four sisters in Don- caster -all at home.

But   Mrs. Benson knew the force of that   but.   II had brought the voting ladv to Wanless. Yet Mrs. Benson might have triumphed il she w ould. Sanchia, at the cottage door, was met by the rnxinus tenant of it, with whom Struan lodged. "Pie s not here, Rest Harrow 475 Miss,  she was told, and then,   Oh, Miss, they ve took him away. The sergeant s come for him and took him. And we hear   There had been no stopping her, but by Sanchia s way. She walked into the cottage and put up her veil. She showed a pale, sad face.   How dreadful  I must write a note. Will you let me write here, and leave it with you  to give him when he comes   She wrote in pencil:  My dear Struan, I am very sorry. You made me angry, but I am sorry now. I came to say good-by, as I am going away. Mrs. Benson is with me. See Mr. Menzies when you can. He has promised to help you, and, of course, I will too, if I can. Yours always, S. P.  With the fold of the envelope to her tongue she paused, reflective. Then she took the note out again, read it over, and ran her pen- cil through the last letter of her signature. And, taking two Parma violets from the knot at her breast a recent gift from Wan- less she put them within the paper. This she did deliberately as the Fates would have her. Addressing  Mr. S. Glyde, by Mrs. Broughton,  she gave her letter in charge.   Be sure to give it him when he comes back,  she said. Then she and her protector were driven to the station. XII As Chevenix, once his friend, had said often, Nevile, when his back was up, shrank from nothing. Even while the Hall was in tempest, the sergeant had visited Glyde as he sat at his tea. They nodded to each other, while the officer stood powerfully in the doorway. Glyde s strong teeth bit through a crust.   I know your errand,  he said. Sergeant Weeks replied,  I can t doubt it.  Impassivity became him; he figured the law as the everlasting hills. Glyde, in his way, was impressive. Be- tween long draughts from his tea-cup he asked,   Where s your warrant    The sergeant produced his folded paper, opened and scanned it, to see that all was in order, before he passed it into the room.   Here  tis for you, made out by Sir Trevor Gell. Why, man   he broke out, humane- ly indignant,   what in thunder were you about   A flaxen-haired child, nursing a doll, edged herself through a door ajar, and gazed blue-eyed upon the pair. Glyde saw her.  That s my business,  he said.  Run away, Flo. I ll tell, or I ll not tell, in my time and place which aren t here, saving your presence.  He got up and put his hand on the child s poll.   Well, I m your man,  he added. Tlie sergeant blinked.   Nay, nay, you can finish your tea. I ll just step in and smoke my pipe with you.  Tisn t often I get the chance, in the daylight.    Right,  said Glyde, and poured off the rest of his brew. Flo s finger went into her mouth. The sergeant lit, the sergeant puffed. A remark seemed proper.   Seem- ingly,  he said,  there s a storm about.  Tis like to be the end of our spell of fair.  Glyde laughed; but there had been no side-thrust. A police officer is not gnomic. Safety, for him, lies in smooth running. Thus, every man is a potential criminal; but every criminal, once taken, is a fellow-man. Nobody could have been more tactful than he while Glyde made his preparations to depart. Mrs. Broughton was in tears, Flo sobbed in her mother s apron; but Glyde spoke plain words of comfort.  Don t take on, Mrs. Broughton; this is a small matter to what s been done. You ll see to my things, I know. The papers here may be valuable who knows  A deal of candle has gone up in smoke over them  rivers of ink  I ll ask them of you when I come back.1  He took with him his Virgil and Sanchia's Dante nothing else. At the lodge gates he mounted the cart, the sergeant after him, and by six of the even- ing was lodged in Felsboro  jail. There he lay for a week, awaiting Petty Sessions. There was a full bench, a crowded court when the accused was brought in. The hush that preceded him and the buzz when he stood up made Ingram set his teeth. The reporters, with racing pen, cleared the ground. Thus the world might read of  The Squire of Wanless, every inch a soldier,  in one journal, and of  Nevile Ingram Esquire of Wanless Hall  in an- other. There are no politics in police- reports; but broadcloth is respectable. The prisoner was described as   Struan Glyde, twenty-three, a sickly looking young man, who exhibited symptoms of nervous- ness.  It was allowed that he spoke   firmly Rest Harrow but respectfully to the Bench,   but, on ihe other hand,  to tlie complainant he showed considerable animosity, and more than once had to be reproved by the chair man.   The proceedings were snort.  At the dose there was a demonstration, which was immediately checked by the police.   Hyde, in fact, was revealed as a hatchet- faced young man, slim as a Hindu, and olive-coniplexioned, having light, intent eves and very long eyelashes. Nervous lie undoubtedly was; he twitched, he blinked, he swallowed. He looked effeminate to one judge; another said of him to his neigh- bor,   As hardy as a hawk.  A newspaper called him  puny,  a rival  as tough as whip-conl.  It depended upon your read- ing of him whether by externals or not. He had a quiet, fierce way with him, a glare, the look of a bird of prey. He was very self-possessed. AH the papers observed it. Ingram, playing his privilege to the last ounce, tdd his tale to his brother magis- trates, shortly, but with considerable effect. He had had occasion to dismiss a servant, and the prisoner had taken upon himself to resent it. Yes in answer to a question  a female servant. Prisoner had attacked him in his own carriage-drive, had pulled him out of the saddle before he knew what lie was about, and had beaten him while on the ground. He had no witnesses. There had been none. His voice, as he chopped out his phrases, was dry, his tone impartial. He took no sides, stated the facts. He spoke to the chairman even when lie re- plied to the question, which made him, for a moment, lake breath ; and lie never once looked at the accused. The Bench consulted together. Old Mr. Bazalguet, the   hairman, leaned far back in his   hair and gazed at the ceiling, while two younger justices whispered to each other across his portly person, peering side- ways at Ingram, who showed them his smooth head and folded arms. Colonel Vero was drawing angels   11 his blotting paper. Then they settled themselves, one of them with a shrug, and Sergeant Weeks told nf the arrest. Accused had dec ircd to make a statement, l.ul had spoken certain words to his landlady, one Mrs. Broughton, to the effect that what was to come was  nothing to what had been done. lie had left in her charge papers, which the ser- geant had afterwards examined, and now had in his care. This had led to a brief interlude. Mr. Bazalguet had caught the word.   Papers   What papers     he asked.  Newspapers     No, sir,  said Sergeant Weeks.  They were writings. Poetry and the like and foreign tongues.  The Bench sat up, and now Glyde had the hawk look in his light eyes. Ingram stilled a yawn and impressed the Bench. Mr. Bazalguet, inclining his head to either side, inquired only with his eyebrows. Did we want these papers  Should we, perhaps, for form s sake, examine them  Mr. Max Fortnaby was of opinion that we should. As they were handed up, the prisoner, who had been wetting his lips, said plainly,   There's nothing in them about this business,  and was reproved by Sergeant Weeks. A formidable pile of MS. was passed up by the clerk, whose deprecating glances were not lost upon the chairman. But Mr. Max Fortnaby cut open the budget in the midst, and peered in.  .fauna vcl domina penitus crudelior ipsa" he read. It was a footnote. He lifted his eyebrows then his eyes upon the accused.  Propertius  You know Larin    I know some, sir.  He returned to the MS., then again to Glyde.  You are a bit of a poet, I see.    Yes. sir. 1 hope so.    If it leads you to battery, my young friend   was his private comment. To Mr. Bazalguet he whispered,   The fellow s got scholarship. We might give these back, I think.  Mr. Bazalguet was only too happy, and Glyde saw his offspring re- turned. Sergeant Weeks, safe in Mr. Fort- naby  s good opinion, scrupulously wrapped and tied them. Mr. Fortnaby said,  Let them go back to Ids landlady,  and caught the prisoner s eye. It was now time to ask him whether he had anything to say. Glyde, perfectly mas- ter xjf himself, said that he pleaded guilty, but would like to put a few questions. The chairman, biting the tips of his fingers, nodded, and Mr. Fortnaby watched him. Facing Ingram, who looked always to the i hairman, Glyde asked,  Did you dismiss your servant, as you put it, before I met Vol. XLY1I. 5 j 1 he blrugglc 17s Kcst Marrow  "U.    r afterwards:'" All eyes llew Irom i .lvde I" Ingram.

The Goddess 483 he argued she was very beautiful, there had been nothing definite between them, and ten years is a perilous test of the most faithful memory. . . . The Chinaman shuffled softly to the duur with a marine glass in his hand.  Senol   he murmured liquidly, and pointed out to sea. Halliwell looked up, his mental gaze siill full of the girlish picture before him. lor a few minutes he could see nothing, and then up Ihe coast a bit lie made out the white bulk of a steam vacht ploughing rapidly along, her nose pointed landward. Halliwell held out hks hand for the glass and gave a look at the incoming craft.  By Jove, at the rale she s going she ought to be over the bar and docked in an hour   he thought, glancing at his watch and pleasantly exhilarated by tlie sight of the fast-coming vessel. The day had passed when Halliwell feared the arrival of ships. In tlie five years he had lived in sight of the little sea- port. so many thousands had come and gone without consequences of any sort to himself that he had ended by freely indulg- ing that im personal but lively interest in them that is seemingly never dulled in the breast of the landsman. He indulged it now, leaning 011 the rail- ing of the balustrade, and glancing now and then through the glass at tlie slim white sides and red funnels of the fast- coming vessel. Its arrival was the one touch needed to make the cool morning entirely pleasant. Ships of all sorts were common enough, tramps, fruit steamers, coastwise Spanish liners; but sea-going yachts were more or less rare a sort of nautical bonne bouche. Halliwell savored its approach with pleasurable feelings and a mild curiosity as to its owner. He had al- ways been rather keen about yachts. In tlie old cavs he had meant to own one himself. When The Guhiare slid gracefully up to the wharf, Halliwell verified his guess of her speed by a glance at his watch. It had been just fifty-eight minutes since he had first caught sight of her.  She s what enthusiastic reporters up in New York call  an ocean greyhound,   he thought humorously to himself, and ie leaned far over the balustrade to try to get a better look at her. All he could see as she lay at anchor was the tops of her red fun- nels. He knew, however, that lie would get a good view of her 011 his way to the Club, and taking his hat and cane from the waiting Celestial he strolled down the rocky street to the main thoroughfare. It had been Halliwell s habit for vears to spend an hour or so in the morning at the little Anglo-American club that had ils quarters 011 the lirsl floor of the one hotel in ihe town. It would have been difficult for simplicity to go farther in either  club  or " hotel." Nevertheless Halliwell enjoyed his morning smoke and chat he never drank and the companionship of the young engineers and planters who rather looked up to him and invested him with a phan,tom importance that helped to give a touch of substantiality to his existence. He did not have to play the sneak with them, for they were not the kind lo ask   ues- tions. In out-of-the-wav places curiositv is frowned upon by the majority for multifari- ous reasons, and Halliwell had never been called upon to give an explanation of his prolonged stay in so modest and retired a seashore resort as Coatzacoalcos. At the foot   f the hill he made a slight detour, passing around by the wharf where the yacht lay. bong years of safety had made him over confident, or perhaps he had grown a thicker skin during his exile. At anv rate, lie made 110 effort to avoid a possible meeting with The Gultmre's guests, and at a turn in the rocky street he came full upon them, strolling up to the town. If Halliwell had ever deceived himself in- to thinking that he had lost sight of his old life and become an integral part of his new makeshift existence, he must have been en- lightened in that moment of meeting with his former friends. So constantly had they been in his thoughts that it was with a hardly perceptible thrill of surprise he saw advancing toward him Curtis Burnett, with whom, in the old days, he had shared rooms in a fashionable bachelor establishment, and beside him, chatting gaylv, Alice Ware, the woman who had come to be the pivotal fact of his existence. It was largelv because of this absence of surprise on Halliwell's part that his two friends found themselves at ease, and their greetings and his presentation to the others of The Gnhiare's party, who came up, were accomplished with an astonishing lack of embarrassment. I    v  ihterinl I'm ivc rnin  I'aae 4B; The Goddess 4S5 But if in the first moment of meeting there had been no room for any emotion so trivial as surprise, there was ample oppor- tunity, in the pause which quickly suc- ceeded greetings and introductions, fur a rush of memories sufficiently rtverwhelniing and painful to reduce Halliwell to silence as he walked up the street beside Miss Ware. She, too, was silent. The most innocent comment, the most commonplace question seemed barbed with hidden meaning. She rejected tumultuously, one after another, every remark that occurred to her, and it was finally in sheer desperation that she took refuge in the banal interrogation: ' Have you been well   Halliwell justified her conversational ef- fort by the gravity with which he met her question.  Entirely. And you    Quite although our chaperon, the dearest and most tactless of creatures, tells me I am looking fagged    Chaperon    he hazarded. Miss Ware turned an amused eye upon him.   Voits n en voyez pas hi necessit'c   she asked lightly. "Let me tell you that I am still unmarried I am still Alice Ware    Ah   said Halliwell helplessly, and he stared at Burnett s back vanishing up the street.  He is a very attractive fellow   he murmured in apology. Miss Ware followed his gaze.  I appreciate the vicarious compliment,  she said gayly.  But we are simply the best of friends.  Halliwell looked al her. An immense rush of gladness flooded his whole being. He had had no idea that he would care so muih.  You see I will make mistakes,  he vent- ured humbly at length.  1 have ten whole years to make up   Miss Ware stopped in her slow walk. Her cheeks flushed and her eyes were ten- der with sympathy.  Ah, let me help you   she cried im- pulsively, and she stretched out a slim white hand to him. II In the ten days that followed, Halliwell came into his own again. The old life which he had lived over in imagination during his exile became a reality once more. Vol. XLV1I. 51 His friends Halliwell found that the party on board The Giiliuire, with the exception of Randolph King, her owner, the oil magnate from Pittsburg, Mrs. Ells- worth, the intensely frank chaperon, and Yon Graffenried, an attache of the Aus trian Legation, whom they had enticed from his official duties in Mexico C'itv, were all old friends welcomed him with un- affected cordiality. It was astonishingly simple. They just ignored things. Across the chasm of ten years which had elapsed since he had been one of them, they quickly built a  practicable  bridge, over which they stepped gayly, with but now and then a look downward at the abvss. No one was as surprised as Halliwell himself at the astounding ease with which this renewal of relations had been effected, and in the waking hours of the night he was given to speculating about it uneasily. But during the day he was for the most part too happy and too busily occupied to lit- con- scious of anything but the pleasantness of his new life. His mornings were usually spent going about with King; that gentleman, having invested heavily in oil properties in Mex- ico, was astutely combining business with pleasure, and had invited the party to cruise with him in Mexican waters that he might have the opportunity of select- ing the site for a big oil refinery near Coatzacoalcos. In this search Halliwell was, of course, of immense help and gave prodigally of his time and knowledge of the surrounding country. The afternoons and evenings he passed with Miss Ware and the others, making little excursions up the river in the yacht s naphtha launch or idling under the awnings on The Gulnare's deck. ll was during these hours of social inter- course that Halliwell stood most in need of the help which Miss Ware had so warmly proffered. In spite of care lie sometimes stumbled, in spite of the heroic efforts of his friends there were awkward pauses, perilous lapses. These had been harrow- inglv frequent at first, but as the days passed their intercourse settled down into a normal groove. Curiously enough, as Halliwell s friends became more and more at ease with him, Halliwell himself began to feel a constraint, a restlessness in their society; they were too ISC, The Cincldess ra-  , lie Ic ihl liinisrlf tnnk I liing.  too ' mi f   1.111111-i 11   ti ir gran tnl.

THE PROCESSION By Sarah N. Cleghorn No witch s brew, or midnight incantation Brings them to walk the rafters of my garret; But a fresh wind, tliat blows from far the music Of falling water: Then do they come, the cavaliers of Raleigh, Or Pilgrims landing on their frozen headland,  And playing fearless in the wolfish forest, The Pilgrim children   Sometimes alone, sometimes by moonlight courting, I see their grave and lily-slender daughters; Sometimes I iiear their stalwart sons rough-riding To join the muster. Out of the dark rolls forth the Conestoga: Westward forever billows its great mainsail:  Fording at last the fabled Mississippi, Bound for the Rockies  Through the green valley of the Old Dominion Marches the South behind her mighty Captain; But hark  1 hear a hundred thousand voices Sing  Father Abraham.  Last in the shadowy concourse of my people, I see the civil soldiers of the future, Welcomed with ringing of the bells and salvoes In every township; Who, where they come, increase, not burn, the harvest: About whose camp are children safely playing: And harmless beasts their fathers shot for pastime Creep near, and trust them. I am well rested, though with little sleeping: The mists are rolling .seaward from my country; The morning touches with a golden linger Schoolhouse and steeple.

Somerset Maugham and greater, on tin- other hand, than that of the usual " literary dramatist,  self-styled, whom Mr. fitch probably held in considerable contempt. His res  ect for the theatre was so great that he saw men and women in the world about him, heard conversations in his daily ram- bles, observed incidents and characters, in the light of possible stage material. It was not in him to divorce this daily reality trom the theatre. If it was good enough for life, it was not too good for the drama nor too mean. This, when you come to think   l it, is a high respect. And his respect lor the theatre, also, was such that his wish was to appeal to its habitual audiences, to catch their ear and win their favor. For the dra- matic cults, the associated " high brows,  as they are known on Broadway, lie cared not at all. That, at bottom, the desire for pecuniary gain had anything tn do with this, all who knew Mr. Fitch can stoutly deny. It was an instinct with him. It led him, no doubt, intu excesses of caricature or  comic relief  which marred even hi  best plays, as  The Truth." But, on the other hand, it kept his work immediately and practically effective and enabled him to exert his influence along the only lines that were for him potential. Because he respected the actual theatre too much to give it less than reality. so far as he could, and because he respected the actual theatre too mucIt to withdrawcontemptuouslvfrom its verdicts, he made the actual theatre a better place within his own too brief life- time, he helped to increase critical respect lor it, and to refine popular appreciation. When Mr. I-itch began to get a hearing in the theatre, in iSqo, he was but four years out  if Amherst College. Me came on with the new generation who had been born too late for I lie blank verse heroics of the Victorian era or its silly farces, sentimen talities, and endless adaptations I mm the french of the s  I tool ol Si ribe. It was in cumbent upon the newerdramatists lo bend the prose drama into either a convincing substi lu le for poetical heroics an  1 romance, ora sufficiently truthful pit ture of men and manners to answer an intellectual need. I nconscimisly, perhaps, lliev chose the lat- ter course. Silly plays, tawdry arrange- ments of artificial situations,and shop-worn theatrical "passions  still nourished and still llourish. Doubtless they always will. But at the time Mr. Fitch began to write, in Germany, France. England, and even in America, there were signs of better things. Ibsen s "Ghosts  was produced in Berlin at the Freie Biiline in i88y, at the Theatre Libre in Paris in 18 go, by the Independent Theatre in London in iSqt, and at the Berkeley Lyceum in New York in 1894. Ibsen s  A Doll s House  was first played in Fngland. however, in i88g. This per- formance almost immediately followed the production of Pinero s "The Profligate,  his first serious drama. Ibsen s effect there- after 011 Jones and Pinero was considerable, even if they had got on the track of what Mr. Jones sententiously called  the great realities of modern life  before the Norwe- gian was heard in English. What William Archer calls   a declaration of independence from French adaptations  ensued in Great Britain. In America, more remote from the whirlpool of controversy, the declara- tion of independence was slower in com- ing. But looking back over the last decade of the nineteenth century, we remember sharply James A. Herne s realistic dramas, " Shore Acres,  " Sag Harbor,  and " Grif- fith Davenport,  the Civil War melodramas of Bronson Howard, Belasco, and Gillette, the " state   plays of Augustus Thomas, and Clyde Fite h s " Nathan Hale and   Barbara Frietchie.  These stand out as vividly na- tional against the Xenda romances then raging. They did seriously and more or less consciously what Harrigan and Han and Charles Hoyt were doing unconscious- ly and farcically using American material, truthfully observed, for purposes of drama. But so far only one of these men, James A. Herne, had gone much beyond obvious material. Probably he alone was fully con- scious of the stream of tendency which he was alike guiding and guided by. Mr. Herne died, Mr. Howard ceased to write, Mr.  lillette faded into a more or less innoc- uous adapter of foreign work. Mr.Thomas has only in the past few years come to a full realization of what the drama means to him. But Clyde Fitch, man of the theatre though he was, cutter of garments to the order of any star, adapter and collaborator when the  all came, in his numerically huge output continued to furnish a steady proportion of The Dramatist as Ma i of Letters A i no rii .111 dramas, t rut lit nil   i  1 isen i   11.    i 111 an iin rca-ing purpose behind tlicin and an increasing w ealth of signiln an  ami satirii al detail.

A gentle ridicule pervaded this scene, but ridicule which resided entirely in the aptness of the characters themselves and of what they did.   The Girl with the  Jreen Eyes   produced by Mrs. Bloodgood in 1902  was a play of more serious mettle. Here Mr. Fitch set earnestly to work at last to study a character. But he could not forego his detail, he could not keep out of his play those strokes of observation. That was one of his weaknesses; he abused his virt- ues by overworking them. The scene show- ing the Cook's Tourists before the Apollo Belvidere was capital fun, but hardly lie- longed in this serious drama of jealousy any more than did the young man who was in- cessantly taking pills.   Her Own Way  and "Her Great Match,  written in 1905 and 1905 for Miss Maxine Elliott  cut to order, as it were , on the other hand justified the "Fitchian tie- tail - already this close and sprightly ob- servation of the surface of life had come to be accepted as a sort of standard.   ne was willing to pause and watch the minor characters and the intimate details of the story whit h were so vivid a part   f the charm. In   dad of It"  a failure  Mr. Fitch endeavored to dramatize a depart- ment store, which was at least daring. In "Girls,  an adaptation from the German  1908 , he shaped the original so much into his own manner that it became prat tically his play: and here his vivid observation of surface detail was seen at its best. The life of three bachelor girls in a New York flat the rattling of water in the steam radiator, the singing of a   vocalist  across the air-shaft, the washing of handkerchiefs in a bowl, laterspread to dry on the window pane, the suppers of eclairs and chocolate, the rows with the janitor that was its substance, and that was caught with such smiling assurance, such deft truth, that it had the tang of actuality which the story of the play cjuite missed, and, slight and unimportant as the little piece was, it made you dissatisfied with many a more ambi- tious drama, dissatisfied because the more ambitious drama lacked thissurface reality, this sense of scenes and persons lifted out of life and set down upon the stage. A truthful surface texture, indeed, was with Mr. Fitch a matter of style, and almost as much an instinct as personal c leanliness. It is no criticism of his truth as an artist to say that his people, even in the most am- bitious of his plays, were generally small people, engaged in somewhat trivial affairs and moving in a shallow and trivial social world, ll made many good people angry when, in " Her Own Way,  a family were plunged in tragic gloom because they had lost all their fortune save a paltry $600,000. Vet, for these shallow little millionaires, that was tragic. So long as Mr. Fitch re- mained true to the types he chose to depict, and among whom, it must be confessed, he seemed to move with the most pleasure, his art might be limited, but it could not be called false. He set out deliberately to study these types in serious drama, at least twice, to put aside except for the mere pur- poses of background the adroit surface de- tail, the array of amusing minor person- ages. the satirical or comic little interludes which he knew so well how to transfer from the avenue to the stage, and to track down the deeper spiritual truths of char- acter. These plays were  The Girl with the Green Eyes  and  The Truth.  In both of them he failed of complete success. In both of them he did demonstrate that he was not fully an artist, not, however, be- cause he 1 hose trivial types that was his right but because be could not remain consistently true to his task of tracking them down. The trouble in  The Girl with the Green Eyes  was the plot, the chain of circum- stances which revealed the character of Jinny, the jealous wife. Those circum- stances were largely external to her char- acter, arbitrary and artificial, Jinny re- mains true to herself in this play, to be sure, but it is not the fate of most of us to have unmitigated cads for younger brothers, as Jinny had, and it is only on the stage, per- haps, that a husband would risk his domes- tic happiness and the love of his wife by concealing the truth about her abominable brother under the mistaken notion that his The I  ramatist us Man of Letters   111 ii  r"    mi idled li'm iii I ecp ,i promise lu lliat young gentleman.

It is. al any rate, his most masculine work, for nine putting forth a man as the i I ief personage and serioihlv studying him. But here again occurs the paradox his virtue i' his fault. I li- plav fails of his higher purpose because plot and purpose do not comport. "The Citv " is, suppc 'sedly. an ex  ms'ni, ,n of the idea that New York. or. for that matter, anv large city "shows up" a man in his true minis, brings to the si 111 at e hi - keenest amoitions and largest interests, so that if those ambitions ami interests are mi- wortliv, the man c omes to know it, and tlie Tlie Dramatist as Man of Letters world conics to know it also. The people from the little town of Middleberg in Mr. Fitch s play were moral hypocrites, as their father had been before them. It was not till they satisfied their longings and got into tlie thick of affairs in New York that they were brought to realize the fact, however. This is a fresh and perhaps a jus  view of urban influence. But the play fails of making il clear and convincing, because Mr Fitch, too concerned with his theatrical story, brought about the revelation of hypoc- crisv to the hero not by the influence of tlie city, but by the plotting of asinglecharacter, the degenerate and illegitimate offspring of the country father. For tlie working out of that long, lurid, and theatrically exciting second act, tlie scene of the story need really never have left Middleberg. Mr. Fitch, too intent on his plot, forgot his purpose. His instinct was right. It was a virtue. He lacked the genius, however, to fuse his story with the exposition of character and the development of an intellectual idea. Not his preoccupation with petty people was his artistic weakness though it may have been his moral weakness hut his lack of a balanced intellectual judgment on his own work, of a sufficient power of concen- tration on one mood or one idea. Admitting these, his limitations, his half failures and incomplete realizations, we must at the same time admit his positive merits and, striking the balance, judge him as one whose contributions to stage litera- ture possessed considerable truth and value of themselves, and have been of even more significance as influence and example. In the long array of his plays, stretching over a period of almost twenty years, will be found a varied record of the foibles and fashions of the hour, the turns of speech which char- acterized the fleeting seasons, our little local ways of looking at little things, the popular songs we were singing, the topics which were uppermost in our social chat our taste in decoration, our amusements, the deeper interests, even, of our leisured classes; and always a portrait gallery of vividly drawn minor characters of great historic interest. Supplement the texts and stage directions of Mr. Fitch s plays with a collection of flash-light photographs of the original productions, to picture the cos- tumes and settings  a collection of such stage photographs would be of great value to any historical library , and they will afford twenty, fifty, a hundred years hence a more authentic and vivid record of our American life from 1890 to 1910, so far as it was lived in the gayer parts of town, than any other documents, whether the files of the newspapers or the fiction of the hour. The minute and faithful gift of observation which was his gave Mr. Fitch's plays at once their most immediate appeal and their most lasting value. Ruskin long ago pointed out that the only  historical paint- ing  which will have value for our descen- dants is our record of our own times. The same is true of drama. Our descendants will not care what we thought of the French Revolution or even of the Civil War. But what we thought of our own immediate sur- roundings will be to them of historic in- terest and worth. They, at least, will be glad that the best of Mr. Fitch s plays have been preserved in print. And because his appeal was soimmediate, because his success, due to his keen and sprightly observation, was so great, his in- fluence on other dramatists, consciously or not. was far-reaching and for good. He encouraged a more subtle and painstak- ing stage-management a reform that in America still has a long way to go. He taught the value of a seemly setting for a play, of accuracy and solidity of scenery-. He encouraged by his success the choice of American subjects and the stage illus- tration of American manners. When he began to write, the percentage of native American dramas in a single season was very small, and the characters in them were often native only in name. To-day the percentage of native dramas produced in a given year far exceeds the percentage of foreign plays, and most oi them are now concerned with contemporary themes and people with characters recognizably Ameri- can. It is impossible, of course, to estimate Mr. Fitch s share in this result, but that it was considerably more than that of any other single man, no one familiar with American theatrical conditions can doubt. A man of the actual theatre, with the fail- ings as well as the virtues of a man of the theatre, without the consciousness of a prophet s call or the intellectual assurance of a self-appointed leader, Clyde Fitch led by his practical success as a maker of popu- lar plays, which were also truthful plays. La Bonne Comedie 497 That those plays obeyed the tendency of the times and led the theatre still farther from poetry and true romance, there is no question. The pendulum had to swing. It is still swinging. The mission of the theatre to-day is to give reflective realism a full and fair trial. So far as he could, Mr. Fitch instinctively made his plays realislic, he commented upon the life about him In- showing it on the stage as he saw it, often through the glass of a kindly irony. Be- cause truth always makes its way when it is not dully presented, he was popularly successful above most other playwrights. They studied the secrets of his success and wrote better plays themselves. The public  which never studies felt the secrets of his success and demanded better plays. A man who has done this for the theatre need not fear that the theatre will forget him. But todeserve so well of the theatre, to have contributed so much to stage literature, is not yet, in popular estimation, to have be- come a man r f letters. One is only left to speculate whether, after all, some acknowl- edged men of letters deserve so well of fame for any contributions they have mad  to vital truth in art.

'Twas thin that he viewed il.  That simple old critic, who smote on his knee, And named it no more than he knew it to be.  True Comedy   ah  there is this thing about it. If it makes the House merry, you never need doubt it: It lashes the vicious, it laughs at the fool. And it brings all the prigs and pretenders to school. To the poor it is kind: to the plain it is gentle; It is neither too tragic nor too sentimental: Its thrust, like a rapier s, though cutting, is clean. And it pricks Affectation all over the scene. Its rules are llie rules Aristotle has taught us; Its ways have not altered since Terence and Plautus; Its mission is neither to praise nor to blame; Its weapon is Ridicule; Folly, its game.

A person mav not be luid responsible for failure to -cc some obvious circumstance w hen his eves are shut; but lie is responsi- ble lor hi- eves being shut when they ought to bt open. 'There are men who knn'v that certain results t i mil not possiblv be accomplished without certain definite means being Used; and vet consent weaklv tti profit bv these results on the ground that they do not know 500 On Responsibility explicitly ilie i Itiinuicr of the means used lo attain them, li is a lame exruse. We are responsible nol onlv for that which we see and hear, lmt also for lhal which may he implied in the things seen and heard, and whit h we are compelled to recognize as ihe necessary consequence of them. It is not merely l ie actual situation in w hich we find ourselves, hut alsi  the logi    f such situation that must lie interpreted and judged by ii' as lo the measure of our re- sponsibility for them. It must lie remem- bered that the very ground of our respoiisi- biliu is the presupposition that we are in complete possession of our reason. How absurd therefore to narrow the range ol responsibility by ext hiding the obvious in- ferences which the reason of any man of ordinary intelligence musl surely recognize. If a campaign committee, for instance, ex- pends large sums of money, it stands lo reason that the one in whose interests it has been raised must know that revenues are not created b  magic. Merely to choose not to know, is to ignore a definite responsibility and thereby assume an in- definite one. It is like signing a blank check to an unknown order and lor an un- known amount. The man who would rather not know whal his friends are doing in hi- behalf should be- lie-1 d to strict aid mill for his voluntary ignorance. No one can af- ford to have things done for him which he would scorn to do or be afraid to do himself. There is also a very common feeling that any one can repudiate all responsibility in a given situation, if he- will only declare forcibly and loudly enough that he floes not regard himself as in the least responsible for the same. He may insist that he will wash his hands of the whole matter; but there are certain stains that cannot be thus removed. The hands may be washed; but they may nol lie- made clean bv the process. How often do men justify themselves when feebly yielding to the- prevailing opinion of the many associated with them in some position of trust, by the ready excuse, that after all the majority must rule. It is true that the majority must rule; but it is equally true lhal the miiioritx must often fight. A mere- verbal protest followed bv a quiet acquiescence is not sufficient when honor or honc-stv is the issue. An un- compromising attitude of opposition mav have to lie maintained until the court of la  . appeal is reached; that court may be a board of directors, or the stockholders, or public opinion, or in the regular course of leg.il procedure even the Supreme Court of the United States itself. Responsibility often means a tight to the finish. We are responsible for our silence, for our inertia, for our ignorance, for our indiffer- ence in short for all those negative qualities which commonly constitute the "dummy  directors, those inconsequent personages who would enjoy the honor and the per- quisites of their office without allowing them- selves to be unduly burdened with its duties and cares. The president of a corporation or a superintendent does not assume the re- sponsibility vested in its board of directors; he merely represents that responsibility. And w hen they would implicitly assign all sense of their personal obligations to his keeping, they not onlv put themselves in a pi isitioii to lie easily fooled, but actually offer a ready temptation lo such an one to fool them. They are thus doubly reprehensi- ble; for the neglect of duty on the one hand and on the other for actually extending a virtual invitation for some one to use them as tools for unlawful ends. Not only the wreck of a business, but the wreck nf a human being must he laid at their door, w ho by a splendid capacity for negligence do thus expose another to the play of the most subtle temptations which can he ci mceived. There is also the mistaken notion that we may escape certain responsibilities by simply not assuming them. There are some obligations, however, which we do not dare to refuse, and which indeed it is not possible to refuse. We have no choice in the matter. We cannot say in truth that we have no responsibility, for instance, lor the general decencv and good order of the community in which we live, merely because we have chosen to keep out of the village politics, and therefore, not being on ihe borough council or the board of health, it is none of our business if the laws of nature, of man. or of God are violated, ll musl be remembered that responsibili- ties of such a kind are not assumed by definite choice, but belong to us whether w e will or not. Certain responsibilities we do not   house; they the rather choose us.

Another development of tlu- game vvliii Ii ihe old timer is ipiii kly aw are of vv lien lie wait lies a present-day match is the de- velopment ol a 1 oinplex organization.

While tiie development of signals has uni itestiun- ably made the game more seientilie. this ha.- also, as it seems to me. been devel- oped beyond the point where it exercises il- lust intlueme. 1 am inclined to be- lieve that sm h signals as are used should br entirely under t ie management of sonic 111.111 in tlu- game, and that thev should he re.si rii led to sm h as are quii klv and easily rei ognized and vvliii li do nof require a 1'implicated set ot mano uvres in order t" make them known. I he 1 ollegr game has always reflected the lendem ies of the professional game.

In many wav.- this has 1 . en a good thing, for it lends to the i nllege game the snap and quit I:ness and skill u liii h the pl'ofessinnal handling has ck-velnped. In other ways, however,  he imitation of professional base-ball in the t nllege has been a Inss, not a gain. Perhaps the nm-.t harmful feature o  the pr..fcssinnal game whit h the college hoys have adopted i- t he continual chorus of , rie- nn the part nf the players as simn as the pin her takes the hall in hand and gets ready tn deliver it tn the hatter. Kvery player on the nine gives tongue, and the spectators are treated to one continual shower of puerile and sillv cries. The pr. itc-ssinnals d.  this partly with tie idea nf rattling their opponents, I nit chielly with the purpose nf i nveriiig up a complicated set of signals. Even in the professional games the prat tii e is wholly inexcusable and takes away from the pleas- ure and the fairness nf the game, hut u hen introduced into the college games, it is vulgar beyond expression. Sui li games as, for example, the last Harvard Trim eton mati he- are enough to disgust the ordinary man with the whole game of base-ball. Not only is the audience subjected to a mr- tinual chorus nf veils from the players, bit the audiem e itself is encouraged tn take a hand in the game by i oncertcd cheering and calls. The result is that the visiting nine not nnly has tn play against the home nine, but it has tn play als.. against the home audience. This whole pm . ess is ab- solutely unfair. It is vulgar in the last ex- treme and i nllege men might tn stnp it. The college games of the nld dav, when each man did his wnrk '.vithnut screaming, were infinitely superinr tn the games nl to- day in that respec t, and they nffered just a- gooil an opportunity for tcam-play a- can lx- had by this indiscriminate yelping.

T he quit ker it is dropped, the greater respect men will have I  r llie college conduct of athletics. How wide spread the demoralization is which comes from the use of these large sums, few fathers realize unless their at- tention is called especially to the matter. In this respect the military schools for example. West Point have set a better example. It allows no gate receipts. It takes its students off on no expensive irips, and runs its athletic expenses on a modest scale. Not onlv is this true, but il does not diminish in any respect the scholarly demands upon its players on account of their athletic participation; and yet West Point puts up a game of base-ball very nearly comparable with those college teams which are practically professional. Two years ago I went up to West Point to see a game between the cadets and Har- vard. ll was amongst the earliest games of the season. I had a particular interest in it, because I had one boy on the West Point team and another playing as a substi- tute on the Harvard team. The Harvard team had returned from a ten days  or two weeks  absence in the South, where, at an expense of some three thousand dollars, they had been kept at a good hotel and had been coac hed daily by a professional. The cadets had had no coac hing except w hat could be had in connection with their reg- ular studies and in the intervals of their ordinary work, and ye I the two nines played so nearly the same game that the difference between the two was very small. The gain in skill whic h is secured from these expen- sive trips and from this enormous outlay of money is meagre in the extreme and   uile out of proportion to the demoraliza- tion and extravagance whic h the custom carries w ith il. W e old -timers also cannot help regretting that the hospitality and simplicity of the old matches have in large measure passed away. In the old simple davs when two i ollegc teams played and when the boys went into their own pockets to pay their fares, the players were rei eived by the home i I Lib as guests,  icncrallv eat h lellow on the nine look some visitor lo his Imme for the night or for dinner, and the two teams mingled on the basis ol wholesome and friendly social intercourse. To-day all this is changed. The college team drives to the field exat tlylike a professional base-ball ag- gregation; its players take up their work in exactly the same way that the professionals take up llieirs; and nearly all the old-time hospitality and sociability has been squeezed out bv the professional organization. It may be that a sharper game is played in certain minute technical ways, but I doubt whether il is worth the sacrifice of intercol- lege comradeship and friendly association. Those of us who knew the game in its earlv days, w ho believe in it as the best game for American college boys, would like to see it go bac k into the hands of the buys themselves. We should be glad to have the gate receipts and the professional coach abolished and to see the game once more managed by college boys in their own way along college ideals and with something of the hospitality and the socia- bility which came from the mingling of educated men who, while they may be for the moment competitors in athletics, are nevertheless friends and comrades. Person- ally I do not believe that the game will ever be what it ought to be until our colleges have the courage to take this action. Yale and Harvard publish each year statements showing the enormous receipts of the year for athletics, receipts so great that their very expenditure almost necessarily involves demoralizing consequences. It would he altogether to the honor and the dignity of these two great colleges to eliminate this feature of their college life and to introduce an athletic regime which shall stand first of all for the skill which may legitimately lie within student efforts rather than for the skill whit Ii may be rcat hed by putting the sport upon a professional basis of such i harac ter as to demand enormous expendi- tures and complicated organization. Looking bat k over the history of the game for a generation, the player who started with it feels tliat it remains to-day essentially a sound and wholesome game for American youth. Il possesses perhaps greater possibilities for team-plav and for individual skill than any other of our games, and il needs only to be separated from pro- fessionalism and from the vulgarity and extravagance which professionalism brings to restore not onl v its old-time prestige, but also its old-time hospitality.  THE POINT OF VIEW   1 SOMETIMES wonder, in niy leisure mo- ments and they are all leisure moments now how the story of the Garden would have run il" it had been the other wav about, if our first parents, instead of being driven out of Eden, had been ordered in. Silling herewith mv window's open to the skv of Greece; the Parthenon, beyond the llal roofs ol the citv, standing against the blue; all  he wonder and glory of the ancient world drifting dimly about the long ridge of Hvmettus to the east, and the moun- tains of Argolis to the south, I fall to thinking, first of that far-away den where so manv hours ol my lite have been ground out, with ils grim desk of many pigeon-holes, its shelves of books, its severe ink-bottle, and its relentless pens, and then, unaccountably enough, I begin to think of Adam and Eve. Suppose they had been created of earth outside the Garden; im- agine them some evening silling at the door of their wattled hut, tired of the long day s work at the wooden plough, 1 doubt not that it would take both of them to manage it, as it dues to-day on the uplands of Greece.    ne can see the tired donkev browsing on the slightly browned grass, the sheep and goals lying about under the guardianship of the dog, tlie chickens slowly finding their way lo their roost in the olive tree, the red rim of sunset in the west, and Adam, taking a draught of water, rare and precious in this dry land, out of one of those gourd-shaped jars that ante- date human history. One can hear Eve the kerchief that has protected her head from the burning sun all day folded about baby Cain to keep out the evening damp one can hear tired Eve crooning her first-born to sleep, and then- Suppose that an angel, beautiful and blind- ing, had swept toward earth s first poor home, frightening the sheej and the donkey, who would take to their heels over dry acanthus and withered grass, scaring the chickens until they fluttered squawking from the olive tree, waking baby Cain lo his first roar of defiance against divine command, suppose that this terrible angel, I say, instead of barring them from Paradise, had commanded them to go in. One can almost share the anxious hours of planning in the dark, the wonderment about what to take, Adam's uncertainty as to the need of his sheep skin coat. Eve's decision against her distal , the whole bewildered de- bating dial attends anv packing, that would attend most of all this august preparation for Paradisi One can imagiie the broken sleep,  hose glory haunted dreams  hat verge on nightmare, and thal waking, in the dear golden dawn, t  grief at parting with dog and donkev, and to fear that wolf and jackal would spoil the little herd    ne can follow that slow jour- ney eastward to the flaming gate, eyes shaded by the hand to make its glory bearable, eyes shaded by the hand lo catch the Iasi glimpse of the hul that was home.  nd lln-ii  but I have no way of picturing the splendor of Paradise; have I ever been there -  Certain long-past moments of vivid life might perhaps gi e a suggestion of the awe and wonder it would rouse: ilial first glimpse of Italy, for instance, years and years ago, with southern sunshine on brown hill and re- press, or the glory of while Alps at sunrise. Oimly one can realize the awful joy of those first moments, broken suddenly by a grating sound as the angel shuts the gate. And then, the greenness, Ihe witchery "f strange paths, the glamour of it all. Set with trees of all kinds, its loveliness was assured; cedars of Eebanon, tall Ironded palms, cy- presses; and surely writ, if not holy writ, as- sures u.s that the silver birch is there: "Awl In die gales ul l ;iradi c  I ln- liirk grew i.ur cncugli That, of course, may mean inside, and should; no tree is fitter. One can imagine  inadequately of course, if one could imagine anything adequately il would not be imagining, the innumerable, many-colored, feathered things among the bewildering branches, and the delight in watching their strange manoeu- vres. One can share Eve s surprise and de- light in finding little Cain no longer heavy to carrv, for one is not allowed to imagine bur- dens in Eden. Stream by stream they would wander, exploring the four rivers; tree by tree 505 50G The Point of View would lead tliem on; and many an innocent fruit, even unforbidden apple, would they test, Cain doubtless struggling vainly for his share. One can dimly see the undiscovered flowers, tall, white lilies, saffron roses, and a million many-tinted, fragrant tilings. One can be glad for that lightness of the heart in relief from old troubles, the sense of the illimitable riches of idleness, the joy of endless sunshine and endless leisure. And yet it is easy to see how, after a little, the hands of these two honest toilers would begin, unconsciously, to reach nut toward the old plough handle, drawing quickly back in shame; how Eve would begin to worry about the lightness of Cain upon her back, longing for the pressure of the old sweet burden. One can understand the sidelong glances with which their eyes would wander past the bird of paradise, in search of those familiar feath- ered things of home. After all, could one spend eternity at the Zoo  With the  honey- dew  of Paradise on their lips they would think wistfully of the humble noon-day meal of old days, taken as diey sat cross-legged under the olive trees. With their first mis- givings how they would begin to entertain each other  How they' would point out effects of line and of color  One can hear their in- creasing assurances to each other of how de- lightful it all was; but, in the silences, all the old hard things would come trooping back in memory: the death of their first donkey, the hunger of that first year of tilling the soil be- fore the crops were ripe, and remembered anguish would be twice as hard to bear as any day s brave facing of present hardships. So, shade by shade, one becomes aware of the misery of their splendid loneliness as they sit under alien palms, their anguish of heart when the day s sight-seeing is over, and evening comes, the time for the folding of the sheep. How Eve would long to set to rights the wattled hut, but oh, the goats might already have eaten 'the wattled hut  Alas, for the pointless- ness of Paradise: no spot more sacred than another, in all this magnificent expanse, no centre called home. Where is the old pre- ciousness of water, with water everywhere  Where the sense of the divine right of well- earned rest i For some reason the story seems far sadder than that of the expulsion from the Garden. One has not the heart to follow these poor exiles in Eden, doomed to endless holiday, through more than one day; how then shall one endure a year, a Sabbatical year  But I must stop lest I blaspheme; and see, the sun is going down in golden glory behind the Parthenon, with promise of a fine-day for sight- seeing to-morrow. It is not for one of unim- peachable Presbyterian descent to minimize the primal curse of toil. THERE is no commoner topic among the philosophers, from Solomon and Horace even unto this day, than the melancholy waste of human life involved in the endeavor to do as other people do, specifically to spend as other people spend. From the mad and mad- dening pretension of the earthen pots to swim with the brass pots, to keep up with the proces- sion, one s daily newspaper daily assures him that there ensue coundess physical and mental and moral wrecks. Men are going to jail or to the  sanatorium   every day for no other reason than that they have felt it incumbent upon them to adopt the same scale and style of living as their possibly better-to-do neigh- bors. It is not that they acknowl- edge any benefit to themselves from this increased strain of expenditure. Con- trariwise, the male partner of an extravagant household is commonly free to acknowledge that, for his part, he gets no good whatever from the excessive outgo, that he would be more comfortable if il were reduced to the measure of his real requirements. But for the chivalry which still more or less survives, he would open- ly blame  the wroman whom thou gavest to be with me.  In spite of the chivalry, the circum- stances so often indict  the woman  in the crimes or the rlisasters which attend the at- tempt either to live beyond one s means or to increase them with inattention to moral or legal conditions. As to thjs aspect of the problem, which is the prevailing modern aspect, neither of the two philosophers we have named does the modern patient any good at all. There were so many of Mrs. Solomon  And there was no Mrs. Horace at all   What did they know about it   is tempted to inquire the heavy-laden twentieth centurion when you put their adages to him He knows thAh already, poor man. If to be a Solomonian ora Horatian philosopher would make his wife one, he would cheerfully addict himself to Hebrew and Latin. But the wife of his bosom finds no consolation in these trite dicta, in presence of the glaring fact that her neighbor has had two new suits, or two new hats, since she has had one. 1 he Point of View It is in the  article of dress, doubtless, iha the heavy-laden husband oftencst finds himsell  s   oppressed as to seek relief at ihe peril     thr Bedlam or ihe jail. Hut lliere are other ai tides. Take the common case of hospitality. The British middle-class dinner-party is an inex- haustible theme for the British satirist, thr ill- made made-dishes which one must have be- cause everybody has them, the  pastrycook's men' for the waiters, which every guest krovvs the family does not maintain, and so forth, and so forth.

'This is a dilemma which every husband of what we may  with the highest respect  describe as a Philistine wife finds himself at some time, and probably many times, called to confront. Happily, it is not really a dilemma at all. The  pastrycook s man  is happily not yet a factor in ordinary American entertainments. It is a question of things good to eat only ami of things decently served. And this is a ques- tion ef the skill of the hostess. There are de- lightful interchanges of hospitality, for ex- ample, at army posts, where the convives are all poor together, and where everybody knows accurately what every other body's income is.

I suspect that its joints are dowelled, though none of them has ever opened its walnut lips sufficiently to disclose the secret of its construction. I fear it is not wholly hand-made, but was in considerable part the product of such machinery as was available at the time of its origin. It certainly was not costly, but was purchased by one of my forebears of an English manufacturer who had, I have been told, a reputation : Cathedra for solid workmanship. It sustains that reputation, for there is no .ap- parent reason why it should not lie as strong and usable threescore years hence as it has been during the twoscore that I have owned it. Now if I were in need of such a chair, I should not know where to go to be sure of get- ting one having the same solidity and endur- ance. Doubdess they can be had; but, whereas I have been assured that when this chair was bought there were in the interior city of some hundred thousand inhabitants in which its purchaser resided, three or four shops in which furniture as trustworthy could be got, there is not known to me in the far larger town from which I write a single shop in which I could have as implicit confidence. In the procession of purchased furniture that has taken its course through my own home since this chair came in, there has been no article that bids fair to stand so well the test of steady use. I have come to feel that furniture bills are a sort of lottery tick- ets, the greater number of which, in the nature of things, do not draw prizes. And I may say that my experience is much the same in the purchase of other necessaries of family life, hangings, floor coverings  except Oriental rugs , raiment for either sex, and so on. In short the sense of confidence in buying and of responsi- bility in making and selling seeir.s distinctly to have lessened under the conditions of modern American life. I suppose that the fact may be attributed to the greater scale of production, to the wider markets and to the more elaborate organization of business separating the manufacturer from the consumer and making it more difficult for the latter to hold the former to any definite and practical accountability. The dependence to be placed on the shop where my chair was made was known probably to pretty nearly every head of a family in the town, not by advertisement, but by experience, or by direct report of the ex- perience of others. Such knowledge  s no lon- ger attainable. The chairs offered to me in my town may be, and generally are, made a thou- sand miles away, and a hundred stores draw their supplies from the same or like sources. Moreover, while the sale of my chair at its modest price was a matter of appreciable con- sequence to the maker, I should to-day in most shops be but one of a host of purchasers, and any content or disappointment of mine would be a negligible quantity. I should, in- deed, probably make my purchase in a  de- partment,  one of a score in a big, highly or- ganized concern, the profits of which depend chiefly on the quantities sold and are not in- timately affected by the quality of the wares dealt in. Of course, the system has its advantages and some of them are important. The cost of many staple commodities of a quality that docs not greatly vary, for which the demand is large and relatively steady, has diminished. In this class of commodities the competition is mainly concentrated on cheapness, while the quality is fairly  standardized,  as the phrase goes in the trading world. T think, though one cannot be sure, that the tendency is to include in Ibis process a gradually increasing number of things and to make the expense of living, as far as these things go, less for the mass than otherwise it would be. That obviously is de- sirable. But I am not exactly one of the mass. I have a strong liking for comfortable and enduring furniture, fitted to sustain the contin- uous use of successive owrners; furniture that may have come down from former generations or such as will pass to my children s children, with a certain accumulation of pleasant associ- ations, and I could afford, within limits, to in- dulge that fondness. That I cannot do so with the ease and security enjoyed by the ancestor in whose seat I am writing is to me a matter of real regret and annoyance. THE FILL D OF ART Y..  X I   I I ; .

Tin- literature of the monotype is singularly scant. The art has lieen practised by few and at widely scattered intervals, and its historv, siirli as it is, still remains unwritten. Al- though ihe process lias long been known to professional craftsmen, it is to Mr. Charles A. Walker, of Boston, thal we are chiefly indebted for the present revival of tlu- monotype, as he it is who has substantially rescued its delightful possibilities from oblivion. Not the least im- portant feature of the monotype is that il is a medium which possesses particular appeal for the painter as distinguished from the engraver or the purely graphic draughtsman. In point of fact it can only be mastered by one versed in the technii iie of painting, anil was thus not long in finding earlv champions in the ranks 'V ' of the artists, notable among whom, in the i iKl m..111 :r   America, were William M. Chase, Charles Whistler, the sketches ul Auguste Rodin tell a storv of zest and jov in the doing which would be found difficult to equal in the work of these men in other channels. Thrrr is no minimizing the genrral value of such a legacy. In order 11 understand the broader message and meaning of art one must turn the pages of portfolios as well as stand beiore gilt frames, for it is in the print-room of gallery or museum as well as in the crowded Salon Carre thal the secrets of art are to be surprised A new nation, and somewhat self-consCious ami jealous of our position in the world of taste, we have exhibited a tendency to ignore every- thing save the approved and crystallized forms of expression. Any one who devoted his en- ergies lo etihing or lithographing, for instance, v.as looked upon somewhat as a Iritier and a person devoid of serious aim. The grapliii arts have lid rather a precarious existence with us, and il is only comparatively recently ilial they have  enlisted reasonable altcnlion.    i late years.

I he whole programme must he carried forward rapidly and with such essentials it consists in nothing more or less than painting in black or in colors upon a zinc or copper plate and running such a plate through the press, the resultant print being a monotype. Unlike etching or engraving, il is strictly planographic art, there being no marks or incisions whatever from needle, acid, or graver upon the surface of  he plate. In the very directness of the process, however, lie both its possibilities and its pitfalls, and, for the sake of the uninitiated, some of these will be briefly considered. The first step consists in covering the plate with an even ground tone, and then sketching 512 The Field of Art deftnessand tact tlial tin- monoty  if easily takes rank as one of ilie most attractive oi media for the production nf rapid. s  :riterl sketches in portraiture, genre, or landscape.

The Sim   th - ness of the surface makes it possible to work the paint about in any direction, and tlie most enticing effects are secured by the slenderest means. Vet it is in the printing of these rapid- fire impressions that success or failure, of course, lies. The ideal paper to use I.' Japa- nese paper, and ii is not until the paint is fun- damentally incorporated with these fine, semi- transparent sheets by means of pressure that the ultimate result is achieved. For mere ex- perimental work excellent results may also be obtained by using ordinary blotting-paper. The charm of the monotype, as a whole, re- sides in it:; utter freedom. A painter may employ any sort of technique , and, if the print- ing be carefully done, the result will give a charming fineness of tone, richness of texture, and the subdued brilliance    f the lights and shadows. The element ol chance also plavs a piquant role, sometimes working for and sometimes against the desired result. And, finally, it must be always borne in mind that monotvping is not, as are etchings and lithog- raphy, a reproductive art. Kach of these prints is an original; the same effect cannot be at- tained again no matter what unmunlof care and effort may be expended toward such an end ll is not surprising that a process at once so flexible and so full oi fascination should ap- peal to artists, Ouite unknown to the public al large, t u-re was formed, snme several wars since in Xt-w   ork city, a Monotvpe Club. Ihe club was composed of men who had studied at   ulien s, in I aris, and who sought by this means to keep alive the comradeship and pleasant associations of former davs. They used to meet once a month under the pres- idency ol Mr. Leslie Cauldwell, and among the more active members were such men as Albert Sterner, l-.rnesl I eixotto, and the late Louis Locb. Some were already familiar with the process, while lo others il was wholly new, yet aII w irke  I w il 11 cn thusiasm, now sketching Irom models, and now improvising their com- positions.   member who displayed great interest in the medium, and who has since de- voted more of his lime than the rest to studying its possibilities, is Mr. Albert Sterner, a number of whose monotypes are herewith reproduced. Mr. Sterner recognizes few limitations in his handling of this particular process. The sim- pler range of black-and-white he employs with force and vigor, but what he loves most is to paint in full colors upon the smooth surface of the plate, and produce prints of great variety and brilliancy of tone. He employs, as he may see lit, his customary painter's palette of five or six colors, and w th brush, bit of cloth, or fin- gers sketches and models with his habitual ra- pidity and energy. Though he has thus far succeeded best with Rc-mbrandtesque charac- ter studies, such as  The Old Mother,  or pensive bits of domestic genre, such as  La Liseuse," his range is wide. He has executed numerous portraits, has essayed beach scenes with boats riding at anchor in the vein of Whistler's nocturnes, and in  The Nymph" invades with success that kingdom of fancy and sentiment which traces its origin to Rubens and achieves its apogee with Boucher and Fragonard. Mr. Steiner's monotypes already number upward of fifty more or less formal subjects, besides innumerable experimental studies. They add a novel and stimulating page to the chapter devoted to this branch of art. Both I iv tempera men t and by training M r Sterner is one to whom the particular characteristics of the   in icess are exce  itionally suited. His work has never, indeed, shown that elaborate finish which is incompatible with the swif: rendition  shich constitutes the very spirit of the medium under consideration. To master the mono- type one must be flexible and impressionistic; ready to make instant use of every possible advantage, for, once the print is made, no alteration is possible. There is no medium which i ili ers more facility in impromptu sketch- ing. and none better adapted for making char- acteristic copies of one s larger finished work.  n engraving or an etching after a painting is i learly an anomaly, whereas a monotype done by ihe artist himself preserves all the essentials, and is often superior to the original in spirit and freedom.    lustier it was, and no one was ever more essentially American than he, who raised the lithograph from the slough of commercialism and made il a tiling of exquisite and subtle beamy, and it now remains for others to place the monotype where it belongs in the category ol art The start has already been made, and il is to be hoped that the work mav be con- tinued along these same promising lines.

This new instrument is known as the STEIN WAY PIANOLA PIANO and The Aeolian Company control the sale for the entire world. The great house of Steinway has for three generations maintained a prestige and reputation for superiority absolutely unique in any and all lines of manufacture. The name Steinway on a piano has always been syn- onymous with the highest artistic ideals. Similarly, in the field of Piano-Players, the PIANOLA, ever since its introduction has held a position of un- questioned leadership. Therefore, the union of these instruments is properly regarded as one of the most significant developments that the musical industry has ever known. It has been the steadfast aim of the house of Steinway, as handed down from father to son, to conserve ihe great reputation that adheres to the name of Steinway, In answering advertisements please mention SC Rib A JiR S MAGA .I i. and every detail connected with the production of its pianos has been jealously guarded against the intrusion of any element which could possibly be construed as conflicting with the sincerest ideals of art. By selecting the PIANOLA as the one Piano-player worthy of being united with the Steinway Piano, this distinguished firm of piano manufacturers once more jus- tifies  he confidence reposed in it by the musical world. In a Player-Piano, the. Player is fundamental. It is a serious mistake to select an instrument of this type solely on tlie reputation of the piano alone. No matter how high the standing of a piano, 110 matter how excellent its tone, the moment it becomes inseparably united with an inferior Player, the value of the instrument as a whole is depreciated. This is because the Player represents the character of music produced. Who would choose to attend a concert given by an indifferent amateur, when on the same evening the great Paderewski plays   The Messrs. Steinway fully appreciated these facts and they accordingly made a most careful and thorough investigation of the comparative merits of the various Piano-players now before the public, including those of European as well as those of American manufacture. Just as they rigidly examine every detail in the produc- tion of their pianos, so they investigated the Piano-player situation at home and abroad. hi ,t s-i'cri iS luhrrlisniimh  ,  ;,sc mention SCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE SCHJ BN KK'S .VIGA 21 XL I P V Er   ISKK Their conclusion was that the PIANOLA, and the PIANOLA alone, should be used in combination with their pianos. The decision was based not only on the higher order of musical and artistic effects for which the PIANOLA is celebrated, but also on its construc- tional superiority and the better grade of workmanship and material that it represents. It has previously been the invariable rule of The Aeolian Company not to permit the PIANOLA to be used in combination with any pianos other than those where the factories are directly under the control of the company, namely the WEBER, the STECK, the WHEELOCK and the STUY'VESANT. The one ex- ception now made in favor of the Steinway is sufficiently justified by the mere mention of the name. The Steinway house and the Aeolian house are the only concerns in the musical industry of international connections, with factories in Europe and Amcrica, as well as agencies and branches throughout the world.

How We Select Our 6% Reclamation Bonds Ouv experience with Reclamation bonds covers 16 years. During that time  ve have bought and sold 7.S separate issues of Drainage and Irrigation bonds. All luive been secured by tirst liens on good farm land, and 110 investor has lost a dollar through de- fault in interest or principal. We are the largest purchasers of Reclamation bonds, and thousands of bond buyers place confi- dence in our selections.  s a result we are constantly offered ths pick of many projects. Thus we are able to select for our customers the cream of these se- curities. Our Competent Staff We employ in our investigations engineers and at- torneys of national repute, and of wide experience in reclamation projects. Certified copies of their re- ports and opinions are supplied to our customers. The Vice-President of our Compativ almost con- stantly travels in sections where land is reclaimed. Thus we keep in close touch with the best under- takings. We buy no issue of Reclamation bonds until all officers of our Company, and all engineers and at- torneys employed in the matter, unanimously agree on the safety of the bonds in question. The Exact Data In irrigation projects water supply is now deter- mined by Government records covering a number of years. Government surveys show the area drained by the streams in question. Government records tell the minimum rainfall. When fc-rtililv is in question, soils arc easily ana- lyzed. We may know their constituents, and the size and kind of crops they will raise. Naturally, men don't reclaim land that isn t re- markably fertile. These' lands on the average are the most productive farm lands in America. And the question of crop failure i-  practically eliminated by the control of water supply. There are few undertakings where the security of a lien can be more exactly determined than in reclama- tion projects right1 ' investigated. The Government itself is spending many millions of dollars on such projects, depending solely on the land for repayment. Farm Lien Security Reclamation bonds are secured by first liens on good farm land. In irrigation projects the liens are given by land owners in payment for water rights. The bonded indebtedness rarely exceeds one- fourth the land's value. As the liens are paid off in annual installments the security increases each year. The bonds are additionally secured by a first mortgage on all the properly in which the proceeds of the bonds are invested. Thus we combine Cor- porate responsibility and management with farm lien security. Some Reclamation bonds are issued by organized districts, so the bonds become tax liens. Some are  Carey Act  bonds, where die State supervises the pri iject. All are serial bonds, so the indebtedness is rapid- ly reduced. One may get these bonds maturing all the way from one to twenty years. The denomina- tions are $100, S500 and Si,000. The interest rate is six per cent. These bonds have become the most popular bonds that we handle. In our estimation il is hard to Con- ceive of any more inviting security.

The workmen are paid by the hour not by the piece so there is no incentive for them to devote less time and care to any operation than is its due. No over-time work is permitted, because work so done is generally not so painstaking as it should be. We do not employ a  night shift,  because in this way responsibility is divided, ana work done by artificial light cannot be as good as that done by daylight. Finally, nothing is rushed through the "White Factory. Each operation is allotted the full time necessary to secure the highest standard of quality. For example, forty-two working days elapse between the time a body is received into the paint shop and the time it is sent to the assembling-room. Similarly, every other operation receives every care which our ten years  experience in manufacturing high-grade automobiles can suggest.

The STUDEBAKER-GARFORD idea is lasting quality and de- pendability the refusal to sacrifice the strength or efficiency of any one feature at another feature s gam. To make an evenly balanced automobile of consistent design and construction. Not to seek for speed at the expense of comfort, safety and excessive wear-and-tear yet the car will do a mile a minute. Not to break hill climbing records at the cost of economical maintenance and touring flexibility, but abundant power always.

In other words, the STUDEBAKER-GARFORD is a consistently balanced combination of proven essentials, which results in a chassis good enough at the end of ten years to warrant a new body, and that will give satisfactory and economical service every day of the ten years. When you buy a car don t let some glib salesman hold a magni- fying glass before some  freak  feature as a selling point which is obtained at the sacrifice of comfort, reliability or service.

THE  FIRST AND FOREMOST  ELECTRIC THE BAKER was the first elec- tric ever built, and it is still the foremost electric. Its builders have had twice the experience of most makers; and the experience shows in every detail of every Baker model. No other electric embodies so many fine points of mechanical superiority as the Baker; no other is so graceful in design so supremely luxurious in finish are some of the reasons why Baker Glecttics have remained, in spite of all competition, the acknowledged Standard of the World. THE ONLY COMPLETE LINE We make more types of cars than any other manufacturer, and every car is the best of its type. The line for 191U includes Victorias, Coupes, Brough- ams, Landaulets, Runabouts, Roadsters, etc. THE HANDSOMEST DESIGNS The title  Aristocrats of Motordom  was bestowed nn Baker Electrics because of their graceful lines, sumptuous appointments and superb finish. No other electric can be compared with the Baker in attractiveness of appearance. THE SAFEST CONTROL The continuous torque drum type controller is absolutely proof against sparking and  freezing.  The only perfectly safe controller. THE GREATEST MILEAGE Baker Electrics will go farther on a single charge than any other make. One Baker Electric made 160 miles 011 a single charge, the world s lecord. THE MOST SPEED Baker Electrics are not built for speeding or for  stunts,  but be- cause of refinements in construction that eliminate friction, they are the fastest of all electrics. THE BEST TRANSMISSION All new models have our improved bevel gear shaft drive trans- mission  the greatest improvement ever made in electric motor car construction. It requires no adjustment, and its constant lubrication gives practically unlimited life, increasing the effici- ency of the car the longer it is operated. This new drive entirely eliminates all chain troubles and puts the Baker so far in advance of all other electrics that comparison is no longer possible. The public's appreciation of Baker quality and mechanical efficiency is shown by the fact that the demand for Baker Electrics exceeds the demand for all other electrics combined. The Baker is the car that sells because it satisfies.
