OF STEPHEN THE WESTERNER  I AM of the West out of the land out of the velvety creeping and straining I have resolved I have been born like a wind I come sweating and steaming out of the corn rows  Deep in the corn I lay ages and ages folded and broken old and benumbed My mother the black ground suckled me When I was strong I builded a house facing the east The hair on my arm was like the long grass by the edge of the forests  Behold I am one who has been building a house and driving nails with stones that break The hammer of song has been given me I am one with the old gods an American from Dakota from the deep valley of the Mississippi from Illinois from Iowa from Ohio   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Would you know what has befallen In my warm ignorance I lay dead in the corn rows On the wind came rumors and cries I squirmed and writhed I was frightened and wept My fathers emerged from the corn and killed each other in battle I am a man come into the city of men out of the mouth of the long house Hear the wind in the caves of the hills My strength is terrible I stand in the streets and shout My children are as the dust of city streets for numbers I am so small men do not see me So tiny am I that I walk on the ball of your eye  Saddle a horse sweep away  Saddle a horse for liberty  Harry my men harry my men  Broken ground for mine and me  In the long house at evening the old things were sweet The nuts and the raisins lay deep on the tables The women cut white bread with long knives They hid the sweets of their bodies with clothes They knew old things but had forgotten old singers  On the straw in the stables sat Enid the maker of harness Beside him sat old men Long we lay listening and listening On their haunches they sat and talked of old gods Above the sound of the tramping of the hoofs of the horses arose always the voices of old men   Song of Stephen the Westerner  Now my beloved I have fallen down from my horse I have returned to kill my beloved on the threshing floor M y throat is sore with the dust of new cities The voices of new men shake the drums of my ears I await long in the darkness the sweet voice of old things but the new death has put its hand into mine I have killed my beloved in the place of the deep straw and cast her away  Saddle a horse Sweep away  Break neck speed to liberty  Harry my men harry my men  Broken ground for mine and me  I am of the West out of the land out of the velvety creeping and straining It is day and I stand raw and new by the coal heaps I go into the place of darkness at the beginning of the new house I shall build my house with great hammers New song is tearing the cords of my throat I am become a man covered with dust I have kissed the black hands of new brothers and cannot return to bury my beloved at the door of the long house   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  AMERICAN SPRING SONG  In the spring when winds blew and farmers were plowing fields It came into my mind to be glad because of my brutality  Along a street I went and over a bridge I went through many streets in my city and over many bridges Men and women I struck with my fists and my hands began to bleed  Under a bridge I crawled and stood trembling with joy At the river s edge Because it was spring and soft sunlight came through the  cracks Of the bridge I tried to understand myself  Out of the mud at the river s edge I moulded myself a god A grotesque little god with a twisted face A god for myself and my men  You see now brother how it was  I was a man with clothes made by a Jewish tailor Cunningly wrought clothes made for a nameless one I wore a white collar and someone had given me a jeweled  pin To wear at my throat That amused and hurt me too   American Spring Song  No one knew that I knelt in the mud beneath the bridge In the city of Chicago  You see I am whispering my secret to you  I want you to believe in my insanity and to understand that I love God That s what I want  And then you see it was spring and soft sunlight Came through the cracks of the bridge I had been long alone in a strange place where no gods came  Creep men and kiss the twisted face of my mud god I ll not hit you with my bleeding fists I m a twisted God myself  It is spring and love has come to me Love has come to me And to my men  A VISIT  Westward the field of the cloth of gold It is fall See the corn How it aches Lay the golden cloth upon me It is night and I come through the streets to your window The dust and the words are all gone brushed away Let me sleep   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SONG OF THE DRUNKEN BUSINESS MAN  Don t try little one to keep hold of me Go home There s a place for you by the fire Age is waiting to welcome you love Go home and sit by the fire  Into the naked street I ran Roaring and bellowing like a cow Shaking the walls of the houses down Proclaiming my dream of black desire  Eighteen letters in a pigeon hole Eighteen letters in a pigeon hole  If there s a thing in this world that s good it s guts I m a blackbird hovering over the land Go on home Let me alone  Eighteen letters in a pigeon hole Eighteen letters in a pigeon hole  Do you know little dove I admire your lips They re so red What are you doing out in the street Take my arm Look at me Ah you be gone I m sixty five years old tonight Now what s the use of beginning again   Eighteen letters in a pigeon hole  Eighteen letters in a pigeon hole  Well I m tired I ache What s the use I can t meet the note I have a son Let s go home It s twelve o clock I m going to get that boy into West Point yet  Eighteen letters in a pigeon hole  Eighteen letters in a pigeon hole  EVENING SONG  My song will rest while I rest I struggle along I ll get back to the corn and the open fields Don t fret love I ll come out all right  Back of Chicago the open fields Were you ever there trains coming toward you out of the West streaks of light on the long gray plains Many a song aching to sing  I ve got a gray and ragged brother in my breast that s a fact Back of Chicago the open fields long trains go west too in the silence Don t fret love I ll come out all right   SONG OF INDUSTRIAL AMERICA  They tell themselves so many little lies my Beloved Now wait little hand You can t sing We are standing in a crowd by a bridge in the West Hear the voices Turn around Let s go home I am tired They tell themselves so many little lies  You remember in the night we arose We were young There was smoke in the passage and you laughed Was it good that black smoke Look away to the streams and the lake We re alive See my hand how it trembles on the rail  Here is song here in America here now in our time Now wait I ll go to the train I ll not swing off into tunes I m all right I just want to talk  You watch my hand on the rail of this bridge I press down The blood goes down there That steadies me it makes me all right Now here is how it s going to come the song I mean I ve watched things men and faces I know  First there are the broken things myself and the others don t mind that I m gone shot to pieces I m a part of the scheme I m the broken end of a song myself We are all that here in the West here in Chicago Tongues clatter against teeth There is nothing but  shrill screams and a rattle That had to be It s a part of the scheme    Song of Industrial America  Souls dry souls rattle around Winter of song Winter of song  Now faint little voice do lift up They are swept away in the void That s true enough It had to be so from the very first  Pshaw I m steady enough let me alone Keokuk Tennessee Michigan Chicago Kalamazoo don t the names in this country make you fairly drunk We ll stand by this brown stream for hours I ll not be swept away watch my hand how steady it is To catch this song and sing it would do much make much clear  Come close to me warm little thing It is night I am cold When I was a boy in my village here in the West I always knew all the old men How sweet they were quite biblical too makers of wagons and harness and plows sailors and soldiers and pioneers We got Walt and Abraham out of that lot  Then a change came  Drifting along Drifting along Winter of song Winter of song  You know my city Chicago triumphant factories and marts and the roar of machines horrible terrible ugly and brutal  It crushed things down and down Nobody wanted to hurt They didn t want to hurt me or you They were caught   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  themselves I know the old men here millionaires I ve always known old men all my life I m old myself You would never guess how old I am  Can a singer arise and sing in this smoke and grime Can he keep his throat clear Can his courage survive  I ll tell you what it is now you be still To hell with you I m an old empty barrel floating in the stream that s what I am You stand away I ve come to life My arms lift up I begin to swim  Hell and damnation turn me loose The floods come on That isn t the roar of the trains at all It s the flood the terrible horrible flood turned loose  Winter of song Winter of song Carried along Carried along  Now in the midst of the broken waters of my civilization rhythm begins Clear above the flood I raise my ringing voice In the disorder and darkness of the night in the wind and the washing waves I shout to my brothers lost in the flood  Little faint beginnings of things old things dead sweet old things a life lived in Chicago in the West in the whirl of industrial America  God knows you might have become something else just like me You might have made soft little tunes written   Song of Industrial America  cynical little ditties eh Why the devil didn t you make some money and own an automobile  Do you believe now listen I do Say you now listen Do you believe the hand of God reached down to me in the flood I do Twas like a streak of fire along my back That s a lie Of course The face of God looked down at me over the rim of the world  Don t you see we are all a part of something here in the West We are trying to break through I m a song myself the broken end of a song myself  We have to sing you see here in the darkness All men have to sing poor broken things We have to sing here in the darkness in the roaring flood We have to find each other Have you courage tonight for a song Lift your voices Come Sherwood Anderson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SONGS FROM THE WOODS  WHITE MAGIC  Who bids us be wary Of briar and snake Is led by a fairy  Who finds dry wood For the fires we make His magic is good  Who gathers wild berries High on far hills Or gets sand cherries  Or catches the trout Where the deep hole fills Is a mage no doubt  Who knows the cool hollow Where springs drip cold Is a wizard to follow  Let the magic begin With the dawn s red gold But the cook is the Jinn  A THOUGHT WHEN NOON IS HOT  Joy will cool my face Joy will wash my hands   A Thought When Noon is Hot  Into very joy I shall plunge my arms  And sing Joy will sweeten my mouth Joy will gladden my throat And freshen my very life when I reach  The spring  BEFORE DAWN IN CAMP  Upon our eyelids dear the dew will lie And on the roughened meshes of our hair While little feet make bold to scurry by And half notes shrilly cut the quickened air  Our clean hard bodies on the clean hard ground Will vaguely feel that they are full of power And they will stir and stretch and look around Loving the early chill half lighted hour  Loving the voices in the shadowed trees Loving the feet that stir the blossoming grass Oh always we have known such things as these And knowing can we love and let them pass  I CAME TO BE ALONE  I went out from the world of futile talking and trying From the world of the wearing of clothes to the nude and silent sky   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And into the woods I came to the easily flowing river Here of my own nude soul to ask What manner of man am I  But I have strangely forgotten all that I dreamed and wanted All that I thought and spoke and dared only a month ago Even the friends of my heart I have lost in the glancing  shadows And the slim white self I see in the stream is the only self I know  I shall remember again perhaps when the blessed summer passes But now oh nothing but storm or peace under a bending sky Racket of winds at night that slap and tug at the flapping canvas And the rock of a good canoe by day on the rapids racing by  I shall remember again perhaps but now I have clean forgotten For I have been glad of hunger and thirst the fear of death I have known Jagged rocks in the rip I have seen and quiet waters beyond them And the clean green banks of perfect rest since I came to be alone  Harley Graves   THE SCARLET TANAGER  All through the silent summer day He sings Ke i ke o ke ay A rich wild strain that sounds to me Like bugle notes of anarchy  O black and burning scarlet one You flare and flicker like the sun Against the black void s freezing breath Like life triumphant over death  I see you burning in a tree From tree to tree you flame and wave You wave the blood of liberty Against the black shroud of the brave  You flare and flare you call and call Amid the dim leaves emerald shade Your note s a love note after all Of love your scarlet flame is made  Richard Hunt   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A SIMPLE SONG FOR AMERICA  1917  Gather US to thy heart Lay us thy spirit bare Give us in thee our part O Mother young and fair  Thou art so great so great Thy children are so small We cannot guess thy state Nor compass thee at all  Our spirits yearn and ache To forge from these few years What soberer peoples make From centuries of tears  Love like a tempered sword Glittering forth at need We can but pray the Lord Who knows nor church nor creed  The Day spring from above The Truth that maketh free Give us great hearts to love A great land worthily  Karle Wilson Baker   THE DREAMERS  War gnawed the bones of nations Hunger went Into the hearts and souls of people Then The dreamers called their tenderest dreams and sent Them out to stay the carnage of brave men Back to the dreamers came the dreams lament Oh take your swords that we may live again  NOCTURNE  Clouds piled up like the dunes In a world that cried for rain Shifted by winds that shifted The dunes themselves in the night Came from the night and drifted Into the night again  Dreams restless as the dunes Where things that were remain Buried while the winds shifted Or brought once more to sight Wandered from you and drifted Back to you again  Glenn Ward Dresbach   POETRY A Magazine of Verse OLD TIMERS I am an ancient reluctant conscript On the soup wagons of Xerxes I was a cleaner of pans On the march of Miltiades phalanx I had a haft and head I had a bristling gleaming spear handle Red headed Caesar picked me for a teamster He said Go to work you Tuscan bastard Rome calls for a man who can drive horses The units of conquest led by Charles the Twelfth The whirling whimsical Napoleonic columns They saw me one of the horseshoers I trimmed the feet of a white horse Bonaparte swept the night stars with Lincoln said Get into the game your nation takes you And I drove a wagon and team and I had my arm shot off At Spottsylvania Court House I am an ancient reluctant conscript  Carl Sandburg   AMONG THE RODINS  If I were a man of Herculaneum A twentieth century city Of the brooding North And I were praying or cursing in the dark And the lava came upon me as I prayed or cursed It would shape me like you Prodigal Son And my pleading and despair would stay forever In that stark gesture of two rigid upright arms Pointing like two trees charred and leafless Towards the sky  Or if a great wind came Winging sorrow And blew and blew And laid me battling with it prostrate And then if the sun came in the wind s wake And kissed my cold lips And made my back quiver gently with revived hope Then Fallen Angel I should be one with you  Let the tranquil tolerant Buddha Towering in the background Like the Fuji yama above the pilgrims crossing a wind swept  bridge Smile upon us all together And breathe his eastern peace upon us  John Cournos   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  LAKE MICHIGAN AT NIGHT  The lazy ships all lazy lie Quiet against the quiet sky The little silver ship lights make A play of wonder on the lake  A mist of smoke that blurs the air Is washed with silver everywhere The silver moon a silvering rose Upon the silvered water glows  Each window on the avenue  Hangs out a star for me and you The silvery winds of dusk awake  A flute of silver on the lake  YOUR NEIGHBOR AND MINE  Her life was like her quiet dress Her burning soul a quenchless light Mothering her sisters and her brothers Who cried for mothering in the night Mothering them she knew Not if the sea was blue Or the sun in the sky   Your Neighbor and Mine  She who was like a light Like a thief in the night Love passed her by But on the day she came to die Death laid her quiet dress away The common room filled with the light Of her bright soul That night The neighbors did not stoop to pray Marvelling at the light  THE OLD MAN  I am old now I am very old The sleep has come upon me And my words Today Have I given all away Nor will I join in the talk Of the old men in the park Tapping their canes around the well I have forgotten many things For I am old Being cloaked in twilight I will stuff my pipe with stars And go to sleep   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WAR TIME CRADLE SONG  The king sent out your father to war As once he sent my father before My wedding ring and the gold on my ear Today have I bartered for bread my dear The moon is dying her throat is red The wind is crying Your father s dead  The holy priest for saying a mass Will take our gentle ox and our ass And we must give our cow away To a man who digs the grave today The king has given us a reward A medal of bronze and your father s sword  Grain there is none on the granary floor The lean wolf Misery howls at our door Until I wake and cut off my hair My son I will keep you strong and fair For soon you shall take your father s sword And bring me the king s head for reward  S charm el Iris   THE MOONLIGHT SONATA  Glimmering meadows miles around Drenched with dew and drowsy sound Drink the moonlight and the dream  Veiled in mists the lowlands seem  Through wild ways and fragrant aisles Of the country miles on miles Drifting cloudlike without will And soft mist is on the hill  Everywhere earth s shrill delight Shakes and shimmers through the night Silver tides of music flow Round the world the cricket s low Harp the starry ecstasy  Of the keen cicada s cry  With I love I love I love  To the cloudless moon above Lifts the old the endless song And the firefly frail among  The low boughs and heavy leaves His hushed flight in silence weaves Deeper than the love they sing  The unutterable thing  The sheer pang wherewith he glows Burns his body as he goes   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Now earth draws the trembling veil  From her bosom cloudy pale  And the messenger of night  Flows to her in shadowed light  Memories of the absent sun  Dreaming of his lovely one  From that fiery embrace Wearied out with lifted face Tangled hair and dewy eyes Drowsed and murmurous she lies In the bride sleep the deep bliss After some exalted kiss Swooning through the darkness dim Still with memories of him Her hushed breath comes fierce and low And the love that thrilled her so Stirs her slumber from her lips A deep sigh of longing slips  Fragrant is thy flowery hair O beloved everywhere Thy faint odor on the air From dread arches of thy grace Wafted What dark secret place Of dusk tresses in the wild Midnight of thy locks beguiled Beckoning vistas of thy sheer   The Moonlight Sonata  Maddening loveliness the dear Curves of thy bright beauty all Lure me to thy love The call Of past lives is in my breast Premonitions dimly guessed Of seraphic solemn things Mingled lips and murmurings On cool nights that gave me birth Yet O mother awful Earth What stark mystery no less Breaks the bosom that I press Close against thy carelessness  Where the holy poem of night In veiled music and moonlight Shimmering cries and stars and dreams Onward in soft rhythm streams With reluctant pulse and pause T o its lovely ending draws Thy long passion when unroll The starred heavens like a scroll The old parable and story Some transcendent allegory Mother mother yet I know Of cool nights that whispered so When I was not long ago When thy beauty murmuring low With abandon like a bride   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Throws her glimmering veils aside The dread love I dare not say Turns my trembling lips away Something deeper something more Than I ever guessed before A new homesickness at heart Hungering for the home thou art As the rivers to the one Sea with solemn longing run So my being to thy breast So my sorrow to thy rest Thou art mother thou art bride By what dearer name beside Must I name thee must I call Who art dearer far than all  On thy heart I lay my head Oh what is it thou hast said Secret beautiful and dread Lovely moment drawing near Thought most terrible and dear To be one with thy complete Dark sweet loveliness my sweet One with thy wild will again To descend in rushing rain To thy ravished breast to pour Through the veins that I adore Drink deep draughts of thee and grow   The Moonlight Sonata  Through long love and longing so Into the beloved flow In thy deepest pulse at home In the dark and silent loam Drenched with thee and tremble up In the lily s lifted cup Odors clouds and starry haze Breath of the wet country ways On cool moon clear fragrant nights Or where thy supreme delight s Radiant passion draws aghast Sobs of thunder through the vast Shuddering breath and murmur of Thy fierce wrath of sullen love Laughter of thy mingling heart In thy lifted lightning s dart Through awed heaven s glimmering bound With bright laughter all around With dark tears into the ground Glide and slake with loving rain The parched caverns of thy pain  Rapturous bridal O wild heart To be part of thee a part Of this holy beauty here Sacred sorrow drawing near Sweet surrender O my sweet Longingly my pulses beat   Dazzling thought and fearful of The dear fury of thy love Even now that draws me down My faint body to thine own Near and nearer yet till I Tangled in thy being lie Close and close for sheer excess Wearied out with loveliness All this little self this me Soothed into the self of thee Rendered up in ecstasy  Almost now thou seem st to steal From my breast the self I feel How my being everywhere As in dream upon the air Widens round me till I grow All I look on overflow And into the life adored All the life of me is poured Through warm portals of thy heart Drifting gently where thou art Who art all things in the breeze Stirring all the tangled trees To low whispers how I pass Through each tiny blade of grass Tremble in moonlight and rise Looking out of other eyes   The Moonlight Sonata  Mystery of mysteries Pang of self and tragical Birth into the enlightened all O dark rapture to flow press Cease into thy loveliness With exalted weariness Render up myself and be Selfless the dear self of thee  In divine oblivion One with the beloved one  Where I press my burning face Weeds and grasses interlace Sweetheart are these dewy soft Tears for me who must so oft  Perish of thee to be thine  Deep I drink of them divine  Dizzy draught bewildering wine  On the grass my head is bowed The vague moon is in a cloud From my breast I feel it stream All I loved so like a dream Ah I cannot understand But the wind is like a hand On my forehead in caress And the earth is tenderness Holy grave and very wise   The deep tears are in her eyes While around her sleeplessly  Shrills the restless will to be  Passion for eternity  Shakes in sound and floats in light Through the darkness Through the night  Clouds and dreams and fireflies  And my songs of her arise  John Hall Wheelock  EDITORIAL COMMENT  EMERSON IN A LOGGIA  Y friend read for the first time Emerson s  essay The Poet A lover of Emerson he  had somehow omitted this rhapsody My  morning s reading therefore was a delight  as I sat on the loggia of a house among ancient trees that shut away the village and left little more visible than the vault of the sky Thus enshrined from the world he finds in Emerson just what I aimed to say when I presumed to rail at the fad for modern clover blossoms that we love to pretend are Elysian orchids and by way of proof triumphant he quotes this passage  The sign and credentials of the poet are that he announces that which no man foretold He is the true and only doctor he knows and tells he is the only teller of news for he was present and privy to the appearance which he describes He is a beholder of ideas and an utterer of the necessary and causal For we do not speak now of men of poetical talents or of industry and skill in metre but of the true poet I took part in a conversation the other day concerning a recent writer of lyrics a man of subtle mind whose head appeared to be a music box of delicate tunes and rhythm and whose skill and command of language we could not sufficiently praise But when the question arose whether he was not only a lyrist but a poet we were obliged to confess that he is plainly a contemporary not an eternal man  So I re read this essay of the eighteen forties bridging an interval of many years Even the first reading had not found or made me quite the worshipful Emersonian perhaps I arrived on earth too late for that And since then though I have constantly cherished Emerson s small book   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of poems as the innermost best of New England his essays have rarely called me back  Well how did I feel reading The Poet not in a country house loggia but a city flat not in idle isolation but after a rush of poets manuscripts each even the worst revealing its author s secret tingling with his hope I felt like Tommy or let us say Sammy in the trenches saluted by a doctrinaire in a dress suit Noble sentiments about war and its ideals about the sworded hero on his charger about honor and gallantry and glory about  The royal banner and all quality Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war  would seem true enough to Sammy but not relevant Now and then indeed some high sounding ideal rhythmically dressed in its toga phrase would seem to Sammy almost grotesquely irrelevant Hell he would say what are you giving us don t you see the dead bodies lying around  So Emerson talks about TH E POET but he forgets the dead bodies he forgets even the men on the firing line His POE T is a grand inaccessible figure Dante Homer Shakespeare who shall have no successors if only the common people can be frightened away The Concord sage was not bombarded daily as I am with proof that there is a poet in each of us that the dead and wounded of the muses strew the ground that the broken ranks are always filling up with new recruits who charge desperately with unfailing courage even with shouts and wild laughter against fearsome odds He did not gather laurel for the lesser victors in this battle but stood with his round wreath on a moun   Emerson in a Loggia  tain top searching far horizons for some noble conqueror full armed and panoplied to ride in and be crowned Thus preoccupied he had no eyes for Whitman or for Poe those dusty travellers through sun and gloom to whom a more profound seer would have given their due reward Indeed the recent writer of lyrics whom he dismisses in the passage quoted by my friend as plainly a contemporary not an eternal man as if any man were eternal might have been Poe himself that jingle man who has proved a true poet after all one not easy to dismiss  I can hear my friend protest that Emerson speaks for the poet in all of us in certain passages like The people fancy they hate poetry and they are all poets and mystics language is fossil poetry or the poet is representative he stands among partial men for the complete man and apprises us not of his wealth but of the common wealth But this is a concession of the aristocratic mind as who should say Even the king is made of common clay The general effect of the essay is to make of the poet a thing apart a figure enskied and sainted upon whom common humanity must look with awe Nowhere in it do we find that sense of the poet s intense and common humanness a humanness vulgar as well as fine which Carlyle at about the same time expressed with such a passion of suffering sympathy in his essay on Burns Indeed Emerson s Poet may be considered one of the influences which have tended since those early Victorian days to shelve the poet to persuade the people that he is not quite one of them but a wax works figure dressed picturesquely in the costume of some bygone   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  period to be safely enshrined and forgotten  Here in the POETRY office the commonness of the poet stands proved from hour to hour even as it was proved in the Tabard Inn the Mermaid Tavern or the original academic grove I say it without arrogance poets are the same breed whether their names be Dante or Orrick Johns Euripides or that last young freshman vers libertine whom the editor turned down In this office we hold one of the first line trenches of the struggling human spirit reading hundreds nay thousands of manuscripts we deal with naked souls we see them in the throes of divine despair moved to the uttermost by the intolerable need to speak to sing We watch them giving themselves away urged on by all that is rich and generous within them hindered by all that is weak and dull Always it is the same tragedy played with infinite variety of detail Neither Will Shakespeare of Stratford on Avon nor Jonathan Swift Somers of Spoon River can ever express the utmost that is in him and no doubt Shakespeare s failure was the greater of the two  The point which needs to be emphasized in short is one which Emerson s Ossa on Pelion of praise rather tends to obscure that the poet is like everybody else Being an artist he is a little bit more so perhaps than most people with a keener zest for life keener senses for beauty a keener urge toward the fine flower of the phrase a keener impulse to hand out that phrase to give himself away with style The germ of him is in everyone there are many of him more or less incomplete in our streets and at any moment in any hovel or palace the type may be individualized among   Emerson in a Loggia  us in a perfection as complete as Sappho s on her island or Shakespeare s on his rough and ready stage  It is of some importance both to him and to us that we should stand with him when he comes that we should reinforce him with our strength that we should know what he is doing when he as Emerson says adorns nature with a new thing gives to his thought his vision an architecture of its own whether that architecture be in rhymed metrics free verse or some form still undivined  To this end no other practice is available than a discriminating sympathy with the poets of the hour Even what my friendly correspondent calls the canter and frolic of the chopstick brigade besieging the bar of Helicon may be worth listening to for its wild music for its dare devil upsetting mockery of the sedateness of English song My friend professes a trembling apprehension when we gather to ourselves fireflies and call them Promethean but his apprehension is part of that Emersonian over reverence which puts the poet out of our lives by setting him on a pedestal The firefly carries an authentic and personal light a heaven lit spark of the Promethean fire are we spirits of lightning that we should scorn him Will the lightning bearer scorn him when he comes If we shut out the fireflies and the stars as well with hard walls and roofs of prejudice and custom saving ourselves from all out door barbarities shall we be quite sure of seeing the lightning bearer himself Emerson s winged man supra human sacrosanct eternal when he tears apart the clouds and descends from heaven  H M   THE GREAT ADVENTURE  War makes everything else seem unreal but it is not war that is real but death Perhaps we all desire death and go towards it even while we dread it far more than we realize and it may be this that gives Rupert Brooke s war sonnets and Alan Seeger s I Have a Rendezvous with Death their permanent appeal Certainly the instinct of death is more pronounced in some people than in others and both these men may be said to have experienced death emotionally if one may phrase it that way long before the war But there is another aspect of death than that presented by war or by catastrophe or by sudden sickness and I am reminded of this in reading again the poems of Adelaide Crapsey War lifts dying to a plane of group heroism when perhaps the hardest thing to do is to keep from wanting to give one s life But it is one thing to die for a cause and because others are dying for it it is quite another to die prematurely and alone and against one s will to die when life is still more desirable than death There is perhaps nothing very novel in the experience but the experience itself has seldom been recorded with a more piercing reality than in the little book Verse published about a year ago by the Manas Press in Rochester One knows that Adelaide Crapsey would have faced death for a cause quite as willingly as did Edith Cavell but one respects her honesty because facing an unnecessary death quite as unflinchingly her mood remained one of spiritual rebellion rather than of submission She was more Greek than Christian in the ordinary sense more pagan   than puritan in spite of a delicate asceticism of the spirit which is not after all un pagan  There is no waste in her little book It represents the quintessence of experience and its art is governed by a restraint occasioned by intensity It is like the light from a candle which may not pierce the outer darkness but which makes of a single room a world of poignant reality so long as the flame lasts It is hard to separate Adelaide Crapsey s poems from the circumstances of her death as recorded in the brief preface written by a friend She died at Saranac New York in her thirty sixth year in her room overlooking Trudeau s garden as with grim gay irony she called the little graveyard of the patient dead against whose patience she rebelled I ll not be patient I will not lie still She fought a losing fight yet kept her courage and her humor and the extreme tragedy of her experience was only revealed in these poems of which even her family were in ignorance until after her death  She hated to die reading these poems one is reminded of a chorus of young and popular poets who clamor of death to the usual refrain of Because I have loved life well I shall not be loth to die And anything that treats of death less easily and happily will not be accepted by the editors Think of the classics that they would have to discard on that basis But one need not love life less because one is loth to die The mood of sacrifice may be heroic but put to the test one may have reservations about it and yet be no less heroic Our own national optimism particularly   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  that insisted upon by editors seems to be based not on an acceptance but on an avoidance of the facts of life In truth our national temper in this respect is sometimes contrasted favorably with the supposed pessimism of races whose outlook is not conditioned by a blind folded vision of life Is not our attitude in reality more youthful more suggestive of an arrested development of an immaturity which can never become outgrown because it is unwilling to face what it fears to face Of course a youthful poet may lack simply the test of experience but one expects from editors and from other adults a deeper a more seasoned maturity of judgment Adelaide Crapsey faced the fact of death as a reality Her poems record not merely a personal experience but also a philosophy of life  There is a brown road runs between the pines And further on the purple woodlands lie And still beyond blue mountains lift and loom And I would walk the road and I would be Deep in the wooded shade and I would reach The windy mountain tops that touch the clouds My eyes may follow but my feet are held Recumbent as you others must I too Submit Be mimic of your movelessness With pillow and counterpane for stone and sod And if the many sayings of the wise Teach of submission I will not submit But with a spirit all unreconciled Flash an unquenched defiance to the stars Better it is to walk to run to dance Better it is to laugh and leap and sing To know the open skies of dawn and night To move untrammeled down the flaming noon And I will clamour it through weary days Keeping the edge of deprivation sharp Nor with the pliant speaking on my lips   The Great Adventure  Of resignation sister to defeat I ll not be patient I will not lie still And in ironic quietude who is The despot of our days and lord of dust Needs but scarce heeding wait to drop Grim casual comment on rebellion s end  Yes yes Wilful and petulant but now As dead and quiet as the others are  And this each body and ghost of you hath heard That in your graves do therefore lie so still  Can anyone doubt that the attitude of these poems is one of victory Keeping the edge of deprivation sharp she tasted experience to the full and as the thought of death could not numb her will she perhaps experienced death too to the full  All her poems indicate a delicate and fastidious sense of rhythm In Birth Moment and the Cry of the Nymph to Eros the movement suggests that of a butterfly poised above a flower before it alights Other poems that move me are Angélique Lo All the Way The Lonely Death and The Mourner There is something akin in these in the swift vivid touch to the poems of Emily Dickinson This book stands on my shelf beside those of Emily Dickinson and the two slim volumes by Stephen Crane poets who have given much in little A C H  OUR COWBOY POET  Soon after the August POETRY went to press the authorship of High Chin Bob the cowboy song published in that number was discovered As we stated last month Mr H  H Knibbs found the song in southern Arizona where the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  cowboys who sang it were entirely ignorant of its origin He sent a copy to Mr Lomax at least a year ago and just the other day Mr Lomax came upon the song under the title of The Glory Trail in a little book of western verse by Charles Badger Clark  The circumstance is particularly interesting as it reveals how a folk song comes to be a folk song It shows the folk song in process of growth both by elimination and by accretion for the changes made in this poem through oral transmission are very interesting I think the author himself would recognize that they add to the directness vividness and force of the song Inversions are straightened to natural order adding emphasis and active verbs substituted for weaker forms increasing the action Slight as the changes are they give life Not that the song was not a good one in the start we congratulated Mr Clark in the last number of POETRY hypothetically now that the hypothesis is removed we congratulate him again It is not everyone who wakes to find himself a folk poet and that in less than a generation A C H  REVIEWS  JOHN MASEFIELD  Lollingdon Downs by John Masefield Macmillan Co It is not every poet whose personal reading of his poems makes friends for them but Mr Masefield is one of these   The simplicity of the man a simplicity neither child like nor Olympian but unassertively big and human this in itself seems to enlarge any audience chamber with the breadth of far horizons and quiet it with the stillness of a night of stars And his deep bass voice is like the music of the seven seas rich with all the sorrows of the world One feels in watching him that this poet is a great man with reserves of power in him which his art has not yet expressed indeed may never express unless the organ he plays is the fittest instrument of all life s orchestra for the expression of that power  Personally I doubt if it is his life is like to be a finer poem than any he will write He writes perhaps too easily so that his genius does not reach down deep enough into the innermost heart of the man His poetry is not insincere or superficial far from it but it is not so big and simple and profound as he is Compared with the all round completeness of a great character it is fragmentary mere half strains and side lights  Like the sixty sonnets printed last year with Good Friday most of the poems in Lollingdon Downs are the meditative inquiry of a modern mind into the meaning of life The first one begins  So I have known this life These beads of colored days This self the string What is this thing  They are an inquiry not a solution They are a search for the principle of life a search through and beyond the assertions of science How much does man see   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Out of the special cell s most special sense Came the suggestion when the light was sweet All skill all beauty all magnificence Are hints so caught man s glimpse of the complete And though the body rots that sense survives Being of life s own essence it endures  Fruit of the spirit s tillage in men s lives Round all this ghost that wandering flesh immures This is our friend who when the iron brain Assails or the earth clogs or the sun hides Is the good God to whom none calls in vain Man s Achieved Good which being Life abides The man made God that man in happy breath Makes in despite of Time and dusty death  But beyond man and even the man made God the impenetrable mystery leads on  You are too beautiful for mortal eyes You the divine unapprehended soul The red worm in the marrow of the wise Stirs as you pass but never sees you whole Even as the watcher in the midnight tower Knows from a change in heaven an unseen star So from your beauty so from summer flower So from the light one guesses what you are So in the darkness does the traveller come To some lit chink through which he cannot see More than a light nor hear more than a hum Of the great hall where kings in council be So in the grave the red and mouthless worm Knows of the soul that held his body firm  The tone of the book is almost despairing as if the war s agony though unmentioned were a grief too deep for words Sometimes one wonders if the poet does not feel a doubt of England s future a fear that her great days are over and her star on the wane The brief dialogue The Frontier seems a definite expression of such feeling through an episode of the disintegrating Roman empire This brief stark   tragedy seems to me the best thing in the book and one of the best things the poet has done one gets from it a startling sense of world agony when the Roman legions fell back forever  Chief You see the end of things The power of a thousand kings Helped us to this and now the power Is so much hay that was a flower  Lucius We have been very great and strong Chief That s over now Lucius It will be long  Before the world will see our like Chief We ve kept these thieves beyond the dyke A good long time here on the Wall Lucius Colonel we ought to sound a call To mark the end of this  Chief W e ought Look there s the hill top where we fought Old Foxfoot Look there in the whin Old ruffian knave Come on Fall in  And so it ends Is it the debacle the poet seems to be saying H M  DREAMER AND CYNIC  An April Elegy by Arthur Davison Ficke Mitchell Kennerley Of all the poets writing in America today Arthur Davison  Ficke is preeminently the poet of dreams His early books From the Isles The Earth Passion and The Happy Princess showed a spirit early awake early articulate dominated and lit by the strange gossamer flame lit dreams of youth dreams which spin fantastic webs and know little whereof they spin which tremble with eternal aspiration and know not   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  whereto they aspire Mr Ficke s spirit in spite of the rather debonair man of the world who walks the ways of civilization housing it has never lived in the world of reality It lives in a strange half world above our ordinary consciousness a region between men and gods having the stability of neither yet haunted by the beauty of both  Of late years though Mr Ficke is even now only in the early thirties there has grown up beside this dreamer complementing him a curiously subtle modern and disillusioned young lawyer This split off bit of personality which is in each of us moderns which sits behind all our actions and all our dreams commenting discounting mocking at us and which we can never silence and never lose for more than a few hours at a time this quality is particularly strong in Arthur Ficke It is this spirit which has produced his Café Sketches which can write such almost painfully witty mockery of his dreaming self as these lines  Presently persons will come out And shake legs I do not want legs shaken I want immortal souls shaken unreasonably I want to see dawn spilled across the blackness Like a scrambled egg on a skillet I want miracles wonders Tidings out of a deep I do not know But I have a horrible suspicion That neither you Nor your esteemed consort Nor I myself Can ever provide these simple things For which I am so patiently waiting  These two spirits have never yet been perfectly blended in Mr Ficke He is tossed continually between the two yet   Dreamer and Cynic  he is not now content with either Sometimes he fights upward into the dreamer again yet the upper air of formless aspiration and shadowy beauty grows a little thin for him Sometimes he becomes the cynical modern yet even here he is haunted by the desire to see immortal souls shaken unreasonably  If Arthur Ficke ever comes to rest if he ever succeeds in fusing his two selves into a new self which shall be neither but something more fundamental than either a spirit which with his almost flawless technic his sensitiveness to beauty his sweep of dreams and his balance of irony shall yet learn to face reality as it lies between his two outlooks if this ever comes to pass then Arthur Ficke will be the biggest poet of our day As it is in the instance where he has come nearest to fusing his two selves he has written one of the most beautiful sonnet sequences in English But his magnum opus remains yet to be written  The title poem of his new volume An April Elegy is a dramatization of this perpetual struggle in him It is a curious tenuous almost over modern thing woven with unerring craftsmanship of gleams and flashes of muted notes and broken sequences and diminished chords It tells the love story of two very modern young people who are evidently quite familiar with Freud and live their loves in almost conscious terms of complexes Yet in spite of this modernity it is written essentially by the dreamer by him whose homeland lies past each horizon s rim It has perhaps a certain tendency towards preciousness but it is a   lovely poem more beautiful at the second or third reading than at the first  Of the other poems in the volume the Cafe Sketches continue the sardonic mood of the Grotesques in The Man on the Hilltop and are written frankly by the disillusioned young lawyer There are a dozen miscellaneous poems in the volume which is enticingly slender and eight sonnets No one in the country is a more thorough master of the modern sonnet form than Arthur Ficke and while these eight are in a sequence and lose by being cut away from their neighbors here is one that will perhaps stand alone  The old We are the old And now we know How the fresh mirror dims with passing time Not for us rise the carven gods or blow The haunting musics not for us the rhyme Of dreaming singers nor the lights that drift Faintly through dusks nor hopes that once had stung We mumble down our pathway making shift To mock the unstable visions of the young We mock them tell them they shall yet be wise We point and peer at clods and stones and trees Beyond where Helen living past our eyes Drifts white and Jason breasts the darkening seas And flout our early love songs vain and cold To eyes so certain and to hearts so cold  E T  AN OBSERVER IN CHINA  Profiles from China by Eunice Tietjens Ralph Fletcher Seymour The lover of poetry is a good deal like the lover of wild  flowers One wanders in the woods hoping to find a new rare blossom the other wanders through the world of books hoping to find a new unusual delight But to both seekers   An Observer in China  such gratification is to say the least infrequent And the more one knows of either flowers or poetry the less often does it occur For the flower lover and the poetry lover know the common sorts to satiety and the others well it was my good fortune a short time ago to light upon one of the others  One evening I came home from a long journey to find a little package lying on the top of my mail waiting for me But letters are usually more interesting than packages so I read the letters through before I somewhat listlessly cut the string I undid the paper and then I received my first impression  We all know that the protective coloring of plants and animals is not only for purposes of protection but for reasons of seduction and the same is true of the bindings of books Protective coloring indeed did the publisher but realize it and this one had The first glance at this slim black volume with its exotic red lettering at once intrigued interest  I read that book through three times before I put it down and the next day I read it again Then I waited some weeks and read it once more the charm remained That charm of something new sincere an original thought expressed personally and vividly  Those of us who remembered Mrs Tietjens Bacchante to her Babe which appeared some years ago had been waiting impatiently to see what more this poet would do But the new book marks an advance which could hardly have been predicted from that poem delightful and poetically   true though it was The Bacchante was gentle and tender Profiles from China is strong and free and is evidence of a rare psychological insight  In the Proem The Hand is not the orient we could hardly expect that but the occidental reaction to the orient and what a happy inspiration it was to depict China under the guise of a hand a large man with the hand of a woman and the paw of a chimpanzee The passage The long line of your curved nail is fastidiousness made flesh reveals the shrinking of the occidental mind in the face of the only half apprehended East A skilful hand a cruel hand and worse than all a voluptuous hand Delicately it can caress a quivering skin softly it can glide over golden thighs Bilitis had not such long nails So full of horror is the description that we scarcely needed to have the author tell us I am afraid of this hand Instantly the significance of the book stands clear These are to be no mere imitations of Chinese effects but a real speech sprung out of experience  Mrs Tietjens has lived in China but she is not in the least of China As interpretations of Chinese character these poems are of only the slightest interest it is as pictures of the fundamental antagonism of the East and the West that they are important The poet makes no pretence at an esoteric sympathy which she does not possess Her complete sincerity is not the least of the volume s excellencies Only in the section Echoes is there the slightest preoccupation with the native point of view and although there is here   An Observer in China  much Chinese decoration such as the fifth day of the fifth month the tiny footfalls of the fox maidens and the Hour of the Horse still these poems remain rather as exercises in the Chinese manner than as an intimate fusing of the author s ego with that of China  No one can read the other sections From the Interior and China of the Tourists without realizing how much magic Mrs Tietjens has at her command She is in a ricksha and the runner is young and sturdy and his legs flash pleasantly she is in a chaise à porteurs and  In all the world there is only my chair with the tiny brown lantern before it There are also it is true the undersides of trees in the lantern light and the stony path that flows past ceaselessly  Cormorants is a fine picture and here the reaction is not merely occidental it is radical occidentalism which is called out by these poor enslaved birds Mrs Tietjens is past mistress of innuendo suggestion It makes the book Always does strong virile thought color fancy with her The Well is an excellent example of this as are also My Servant and Chinese New Year But the innate dislike rises again and again in such poems as The City Wall and Meditation  In this age of adulation of all things oriental it is well to meet so fearless an observer as Mrs Tietjens Dirt and disease they worry her and perhaps also cloud over for her something else that is also there She sees but only partially comprehends The Spirit wall proves this She understands and yet not quite But she can forgive sometimes only a little in A Woman for instance some   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  times entirely in The Well Then the irony flashes out again In Interlude a half naked coolie is sitting in the market place   picking at something with the dainty hand of the Orient If he had ever seen a zoological garden I should say he was imitating the monkeys there As he has not I dare say the taste is ingrained  There is not a word too much in these poems They are sharp and beautiful and extraordinarily satisfying One of the best is On a Canton River Boat A sentry paces the deck He is guarding me from pirates And the poem goes on  Piracy The very name is fantastic in my ears colored like a toucan in the Zoo  But the reality and horror of such a state of things grows and grows the quiet fact of the sunny deck and the pacing sentry and behind it  The socks of the sentry annoy me They are too green for so hot  a day And his shoes squeak I should feel much cooler if he wouldn t pace so Piracy  Sunday in the British Empire Hong Kong is too interknit to admit of quotation It must be read entire for its beauty its irony its tragedy to be fully felt  Mrs Tietjens is more than modern or new that much abused word she is herself Her kind of poetry is distinctly hers a perfectly natural utterance This book deserves high praise and is an earnest of future accomplishment Amy Lowell   Emile Cammaerts  EMILE CAMMAERTS  Chants Patriotiques et Autres Poèmes and Les Trois Rois et  Autres Poèmes by Emile Cammaerts English translations  by Tita Brand Cammaerts John Lane London  Belgium comes out of her brave fight wearing her wounds  as flowers and with songs leaping to her lips Of her band of war poets one of the most conspicuous is Émile Cammaerts whose portrait shows a strong face with a young brow yet though he is but little past forty the beard of an old man He was born and educated in Brussels served as professor of geography at the Institut Commercial of Mons and since 1908 has been living in England and devoting himself to his pen In 1916 he published the Chants Patriotiques which is largely poems written before the war As the proceeds of the first edition were to be given to the Belgian Soldiers Fund for the purchase of tobacco the book opens with a song of great charm called  Pour la Pipe du Soldat Les Trois Rois et Autres Poèmes  which is entirely war poetry followed hard upon the other volume  Except for four poems Mr Cammaerts translator is his wife the books being printed with poem and translation on opposite pages Though the translator has brought an eager conscience to her task it would be better to forego these poems entirely rather than be misled by the English versions which give none of the flavor none of the spontaneity of the original Not disdaining rhyme and meter Cammaerts is thoroughly modern watchful for the word too many scorn   ful of what is hackneyed The translator s style is traditional to awkwardness so she makes the poet express himself in English in the very manner he would avoid in French Poems full of subtle charm and individual beauty become in English commonplace the thought being checked in its flow by the stiffness of its clothing Of the four translations by other hands those by Lord Curzon Alfred Percival Graves and Angela Beyer are excellent  Cammaerts earlier poems make a strong appeal poems of love of children of nature all written at a time when Belgium was at one with all the world With a stroke of art he can transport us to a little house set in a garden still bright with blooming trees and flowers yet a house faded gray with dust heavy with silence and make us know that love has lived in it He is always natural always simple and a clear religious belief runs through all he writes  But he has achieved distinction chiefly through his war poems Beautiful as hope and love he can make hatred and vengeance An instance of his implacable hate is found in Après Anvers a stirring thing which has been set to music by Elgar Au Grand Roi d un Petit Pays does tender homage to Belgium s king I do not know which is the most touching picture that of a peasant girl who prefers death to leaving her own home and to whose voice Cammaerts has given exquisite lyrics or that of a little Virgin of porcelain smiling up from a deserted grave near Rams capelle or the colorful one of an Easter day in Belgium during the war   Les Trois Rois the titular poem of the second book is perhaps the least important of the war poems It is in the form of a drama and deals with Satan and his servant the German emperor with Michael Gabriel Raphaël etc Mary and the Christchild A ma Patrie Enchaînée is a bitter contrast of fruitful countrysides and joyful days with devastated fields and towns and bruised hands stretched out gropingly in the night Only a stoic could read without tears Une Confession and La Neige with its beauty and its terrific import  Le Dernier Boche is a dream of hate which finds its climax in these its last lines  Qu importe Pourvu qu il nous soit donné de voir Du seuil de notre porte Tandis que les cloches Sonneront l hallali Le dos gris Du dernier Boche  And Le Tir National is a burst of ironic fury directed against the enemy written in memory of Edith Cavell  Cammaerts has a power found oftener in French poetry than in English he can take an ancient nursery rhyme as motive and build around it all the environment of a modern tale An instance of this is his Frère Jacques the old tune beats out its childish accompaniment in our heads as we read the poet s lines Here we have the story of a soldier who in ordinary life was a trappist monk  Frère Jacques frère Jacques Dormez vous dormez vous   Yes he sleeps in his white bed in the white monastery as the golden sun comes up over a smiling country and the time to ring matins draws near  Frère Jacques frère Jacques Dormez vous dormez vous  No he does not sleep now He is the army s look out man For three days the cannonade has isolated him from the trenches and the stars look through the roof of his grim loft to the Yser He is cold hungry thirsty but he never loses his grip on the telephone We can hear his prayers mingle with his directions Fifty yards to the right Thank Thee God for Prepare the searchlight O God remember our wives our little ones now ready fire Then after a thundering explosion of shell arises the insistent refrain  Sonnez les matines sonnez les matines Bim barn boum Bim bam boum It is difficult to find a poem brief enough to quote that shows characteristically Cammaerts spirit and his lyric manner Perhaps L Amour de la Patrie will do it  C est l accent d une voix Le son d une cloche lointaine Une clairière dans les bois Un coup de soleil sur la plaine C est un certain toit sous un certain ciel Et le parfum de la poussière dans la rue C est une ferme à genoux devant une chapelle Au bord d un chemin où larmoient quelques cierges C est la senteur des herbes à l entour des étangs Et le parfum de la poussière dans la rue C est l éclat d un regard la gaucherie d un mouvement Une vision du passé aussitôt disparue   C est tout ce qu on ne peut pas dire Et tout ce qu on sent Tout ce qu on ne peut traduire Qu en le chantant  C est ce qu on mange et ce qu on voit Ce qu on respire ce qu on entend C est le goût du pain et du tabac L éclat des feuilles l odeur du vent Et les bruits familiers du village Les chiens qui aboient les gens qui s appellent Et le joyeux tapage Des verres sous la tonnelle C est tout ce qu on ne peut pas dire Et tout ce qu on sent Tout ce qu on ne peut traduire Qu en le chantant  C est le meilleur de notre corps Et le plus pur de notre sang C est ce qui nous rappelle nos morts Et nous fait souhaiter nos enfants C est la couleur de notre vie Et la saveur de nos chansons C est la douce folie De récolter ce qu on sème Et l absurde passion De posséder ce qu on aime C est tout ce qu on ne peut pas dire Et tout ce qu on sent Tout ce qu on ne peut traduire Qu en le chantant  Agnes Lee  NOTES  Sherwood Anderson of Chicago who
