VOL X No II  MAY 1917  WAR  I  I LAUGH to see them pray  And think God still is in the sky  The little Christ whose name they  say  Is dead I saw him die  They burned his house and killed his priest Just as the Bible saith We had no milk for little Christ And so he starved to death  II  There was a Virgin Mary made To sit in church all whitely sweet And hear our prayers She smiled and played All day with baby Jesus feet   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Each day our faces clean like snow Amid the candle shine and myrrh We children standing in a row With folded hands would sing to her  O Mary let thy gentle son Come down with us today And be the blessed Holy One In all our work and play  I wish that we had prayed to her To keep him safe instead She did not know about the war Now little Christ is dead  III  The sun waves floated past the sill And buzzy bumping flies My Mother lay all pale and still With eyes like Mary s eyes  I promised her I would be brave And help her and I tried And all the things she asked I gave And never cried   War  But at the end all I could do Was stop my ears and pray And hide my face I never knew The Christ would come that way  IV  My Mother held me close to her I feel her one kiss yet How sweet she was alone and dear I never can forget  Her face was just like Mary s face As if a light shone through I took the Christ Child from that place And ran She told me to  V  There were long dust gray roads to run And sticks that hurt my feet And dead fields lying in the sun And nothing there to eat  The Baby Jesus never cried But with soft little lips and weak Wee hands kept nuzzling at my side And tried to suck my cheek   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  VI  We slept beneath a bending tree The little Christ and I And woke up in the light to see The sun lift up the sky  And all the birds that ever were Sang to the Christ Child then Sweet thrush and lark and woodpecker Gold warbler and brown wren  There were no bells for mass Singing a little tune  White faces lying in the grass  Were laughing at the moon  VII  They made a little lonely bed Where it was cold and dim The baby Christ was dead quite dead There was no milk for him  Eloise Robinson   THE ANSWER  Wave wave You seem to be dreaming Wave wave In the sunbeams warm Wave wave What are you what are you Wave wave Of the changing form  I am a round bright beautiful wave All day with my ripples the shore I pave  Wave wave They say you are pitiless Wave wave When the ships outroam Wave wave They call you a savior Wave wave When the ships come home  I have no thought for a life or a grave I am a round bright beautiful wave   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  EVENING  Over the house the evening settled down The little phaeton stood before the door Out came her husband strong and weather brown Why Judith what on earth are you waiting for He stroked the pony And the boy where s he I thought you d gone  We were just starting when Will heard a droning and he said to me It s from the mine I know the sound The men Forgot to shut things off I ll go and see Mother you take the reins and wait a bit I won t be long And now it s fully three Long quarters of an hour and here I sit  Will knows what he s about said Alan Well There s time enough Jude Why it isn t eight You might stay out a little longer spell Taking the road around by Fostergate I m glad he s learning how to run the mine Here we ve a coal mine right on our own place And it ll go to him How keen and fine He is it can t help showing in his face I thought he might come home half heartedly Feeling himself too tall for us somehow   Evening  Grown different in his ways and wishing we Could be more   Alan don t talk nonsense now You might have known he d always be the same They couldn t make him love us any less Not all the colleges your tongue could name  You re right enough you re right enough I guess  He d rather take his mother for a drive Than be the governor of Illinois Now there s the moon as sure as I m alive Alan step back and see what keeps the boy  And Alan young at fifty straight and proud Strode from the narrow box path s mossy tiling Over the lawn where the cool branches bowed And he was humming to himself and smiling For all the scent and sound of evening blended In one voice singing Our son The high grain stack Crowned by the moon where the long pasture ended Sang out Our son And his heart sang it back  He entered through a doorway in the ground Down in the mine he groped his way about Calling Ho Will There came no answering sound And still went echoing Alan s shout on shout   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Now like a menacing troop of giant foes Dark in the mine loomed shadowy shapes of steel Dark in his brain a dream of dread arose  A darker something whirled upon a wheel  Aged at fifty he came out No more Was any singing for to him the air Was hushed forever and earth s lovely floor Sent up in vain its fragrance everywhere Feeble and faint at last he reached the lawn One thought to be with her He stumbled fell And up again he staggered On oh on He must make haste with what he had to tell  She waited waited looking straight ahead Deep in a plan of trimming for a blouse He stood there and she knew before he said The words Get down dear come come in the house  THE DOLL  The father  There s something strange about the child tonight I scolded her because she had forgotten To fill the stove She never said a word But stood and smiled as if she might be dreaming   The Doll  The mother  This morning I went out to buy the dinner I didn t like to leave her so I took her Well she was tired from the time we started I had to yank her by the arm and pull her We went to see the window show at Field s Oh my the dolls From the first one held her eye A girl a life size two year old with a dress Hand work all over and silk socks and slippers It couldn t have cost less than fifty dollars She looked and couldn t seem to turn away At last she said I want to be its mother Then it came to me what the doctor told us Her heart was weak and we must humor her I said You ll get it for a Christmas present Anyhow I ve had peaceful hours since then She hasn t fussed nor had a fainting spell That shows she can be all right if she s a mind to But what on earth ll we say to her to morrow  The father  We ll say how Santa Claus got stuck in the snow  The mother  Now hark I hear her humming in her bed She always hums and never sings out words   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The song they may not hear  I shall draw her very close to me With my love Oh could anything more beautiful be Dreamed of She is coming I must wait I must wait  The mother  It s all because I let her go to school I never was a one for education For children of her age It gives em notions And sets em looking up too high at things  The song they may not hear  My sweet child is like a flower s light So is She Wonderful Our Lady in the night Near me She will help me sleep and wait Sleep and wait  The father  I ll just go out and look along the street The men have stood all day there peddling toys I ll just go out and buy a top for her   The Doll  The mother  Let her be satisfied with goose for dinner And a bag of candy from the school house tree  The song they may not hear  I shall hold my daughter s finger tips How they shine I shall almost dare to touch her lips With mine I must try to sleep and wait Sleep and wait  The mother  How can we tell her that s what s bothering me How can we tell her tell her answer that Oh somehow I m afraid to think of it The dark in her eyes I know she ll have to morrow When she comes looking and it isn t here  Agnes Lee   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WIND FLOWERS  PRAYER FOR SOPHISTICATION  Close all open things O God  Close the rose  The throats of flutes and birds  Close all eyes  To tears not yet fallen  Close my heart  Close all open things O God  STRANGERS  God I shall tell you I am seeing and seeing strangers Who are not strangers For there is something in their eyes And about their faces That whispers to me  But so low That I can never quite hear Of the lost half of myself Which I have been seeking since the beginning of earth And I could follow them to the end of the world Would they but lean nearer nearer And tell me    Pulse of Spring  PULSE OF SPRING  The spring has spilt a shining net Of green gold buds Upon the boughs Of this gray linden tree  The hyacinth has lit its torch of amethyst  A robin sways upon a bow curved twig And sweetly cries  O spring forbear  OH THAT LOVE HAS COME AT ALL  I am he who expects too much The high keen edge Of dreams is not sharp Enough and the rose Is not enough red I am tired with emptiness For love has not come swift enough But do thou weave O heart A slender song Touched That love has come at all   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TO A COOL BREEZE  You have come After sun stung days As gold greatly wished Dearer Than the loveliness of all songs  Sweep over these arms This throat this brow Parched with fire  Mark Turbyfill  WOOD PATHS BY THE SEA  Who has gone before me padding down the firm white  sand Who has set first foot on the virginal soil All around is the delicate lacing of branches Leaf fits leaf and vine links itself to vine The moss fringes the boughs on the edges of silence How shall I enter the stillness that the wind fears Who shall follow me into the tranquil gray of the unnoted  pines Or watch me when I go past the notched oak bushes Who shall wonder when the path circling the tiny grove Marches to the edge of the world or dies in a moss cushion   Wood Paths by the S  Who shall follow me when I have made a path And where shall I dare to make one He who makes a path plunges a sword into the Eternal  What is your will doubter hesitator Will you not do what others have done Be fearless penetrate there will be many to follow And if not the end of the path is silence  THE HILLS  The hills repass me the giant hills Crossing and recrossing each other like great animals Enormous circles closing and widening around me Here at the gully s edge I see their bodies Shutting out the sky processions of them Whither do they journey whence have they come Humped camels and the bulky rhinoceros Between them the sliding leopard  And beyond again the stone colored gray of the elephant All passing all silent touring the horizon To the dull music of the sun O endless procession passing and repassing  Hunched bodies and soundless music And the undulations living animal against the sky  Mary Eastwood Knevels   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  SIMPLES  O bella bionda sei come l onda  Of cool sweet dew and radiance mild  The moon a web of silence weaves  In the still garden where a child  Gathers the simple salad leaves  A moon dew stars her hanging hair And moonlight touches her young brow And gathering she sings an air Fair as the wave is fair art thou  Be mine I pray a waxen ear  To shield me from her childish croon And mine a shielded heart to her Who gathers simples of the moon  TUTTO È SCIOLTO  A birdless heaven sea dusk and a star Sad in the west And thou poor heart love s image fond and far Rememberest   Tutto è Sciolto  Her silent eyes and her soft foam white brow And fragrant hair Falling as in the silence falleth now Dusk from the air  Ah why wilt thou remember these or why  Poor heart repine  If the sweet love she yielded with a sigh  Was never thine  FLOOD  Gold brown upon the sated flood  The rock vine clusters lift and sway  Vast wings above the lambent waters brood  Of sullen day  A waste of waters ruthlessly Sways and uplifts its weedy mane Where brooding day stares down upon the sea In dull disdain  Uplift and sway O golden vine  Thy clustered fruits to love s full flood  Lambent and vast and ruthless as is thine  Incertitude   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A FLOWER GIVEN TO MY DAUGHTER  Frail the white rose and frail are  Her hands that gave  Whose soul is sere and paler  Than time s wan wave  Rose frail and fair yet frailest  A wonder wild  In gentle eyes thou veilest  My blue veined child  NIGHT PIECE  Gaunt in gloom The pale stars their torches Enshrouded wave Ghost fires from heaven s far verges faint illume Arches on soaring arches Night s sin dark nave  Seraphim  The lost hosts awaken  To service till  In moonless gloom each lapses muted dim Raised when she has and shaken Her thurible   Night Piece  And long and loud  To night s nave upsoaring  A star knell tolls  As the bleak incense surges cloud on cloud  Voidward from the adoring  Waste of souls  James Joyce  THE ABANDONED FARM  In this big house the dead walk They are always cold And I am a young spirit that has strayed among the dead  Outside the hills are wonderful They are red with the sun  I came here to seek the spirit of the mountains and now my soul is slipping from me for I find only the dead  I look out of the window upon the great mountains They are covered with snow I feel the wind and the hot sun on the snow Strange trees climb the mountains like people seeking the heights And my heart bursts for among the mountains there are only the dead  The dead walk in the big house They are always cold And I am a young spirit that is lost among the dead  William Zorach   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  BLUEBELL NIGHT  When Earth stands trembling on the brink of June Spring reads the writing on the sunset s wall And Farewell on the bright page of the moon While one by one in heaven s Cimmerian pall Vague stars are lit for rites funereal She hears Night toll the hour of her farewell And seeks once more a breast whereon to die  In the last wood to yield to Summer s spell That still dreams on with wide and tranquil eye  When the great huntress June doth rake the sky  And sow the world with heat still sees its cool Green mage mirrored in the enchanted pool  Past the low track where many a groaning cart Has lurched above the beating of Spring s heart She fleets June s arrows falling swift and bright The creening curlew wind wails following The old wheel wounds are filled with flowers to night Her reels of gold blue skein and yellow bead Fall from her hand as wild and white she goes The poppy lacking still a golden thread Her needle pricking still the unfinished rose  To night the bluebells die already wan With prescience of her whose death is theirs   Bluebell Night  A sheathing wing the solemn thicket bears  Though heedless birds sing on Though through the listening moonlight wanders still The wide lipped water talking in her sleep  And far beyond the hill Across the heaven s golden vast divide The twilight rose nods to the lily moon  Too old too wise to weep They watch where Spring has fall n and see her swoon With the long spear of Summer in her side  The lean swift bramble hastens o er the stones A gipsy Autumn makes an emperor Splendoured in purple glorious in gold He heeds not April s tale so swiftly told And the young trees whom she may tend no more Forget their cradle songs in April s house And on Earth s shoulders take colossal hold Against the sun spread vast pavilions And stun the great storms with huge thunderous brows  Only the playthings of the year that fade  Forgotten in June s savage fresh desire  The weaving ends of April shall be laid  Sweet slaves upon her pyre  From April s dying hand the jewels fall The hawthorn folds her frail embroidery   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The drowsy hyacinth puts out her light Gold throated flowers that lured the pirate bee Fade like old dreams across the face of night Of whom stern Day forbids memorial  Something of Spring must die in us to night Something the full lipped Summer may not know The sharp sad rapture the impetuous flight That finds all heavens too near all heights too low When Dawn seems but a glittering rose to throw To a mad world and from Youth s beakers flow The keen the sparkling Daysprings of Delight  But not for ever All that died to night Has heard one same sweet word and knows that Change  Though seeming wild and strange Seeming to stamp its heel on all delight And giving Beauty only grace to die Shall bring a rich to morrow though Spring lie Dead as the first faith in Youth s sepulchre  She shall return and glide A white swan moving on the green Spring tide A snowdrop soon shall quicken in her side And round her lips a little sigh shall stir While loud December stamps the frozen ways Leave her to dreamless nights and deedless days And strew the paling bluebells over her  Muriel Stuart   THE BIRDS OF GOD  At dawn Your thoughts like birds of God Sang to you at your play Tonight The horrid beasts of war Have driven God s birds away  O child You are too young for fears And oh too young for sorrow But clasp your little hands And pray That all God s birds of yesterday May sing again tomorrow  THE DREAM GIFT  Rest little child on thy mother s knee  Softly she sings and weaves for thee  Swift are her fingers over thy head  Filmy and fine is the shining thread Sleep my babe while I weave and spin A little dream to wrap thee in   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Rest little child beneath the vines Shadow and gleam in the warp she twines So shall the garment when it is done Shield thee from cold and from the sun  Sleep my babe while I weave and spin A little dream to wrap thee in  Rest little one the petals fall Thy mother broiders with them all A fragrance to the mantle clings Which thou shalt bear at court of kings  Sleep my babe while I weave and spin A little dream to wrap thee in  Hush thee my own from out the bloom Bright wings have swept across the loom Thy trailing raiment this shall be When back to heaven they welcome thee  Sleep my babe while I weave and spin A little dream to wrap thee in  LITTLE LONESOME SOUL  Through the pure ether And the heavenly air A little wandering Soul Seeks everywhere its mother   Little Lonesome Soul  The little stars will play with thee The moon thy pretty boat shall be The sun himself thy horse is he Angels will guide thee in thy flight Straight to the gates of golden light Why dost thou hide thee in the night  Through the pure ether And the heavenly air A little lonesome Soul Seeks everywhere its mother  It trembles at its tiny wings It fears the harp the angel brings Nor knows the song the angel sings It only wants if it should cry T o feel its mother s hand close by T o hear its mother s lullaby  Through the pure ether And the heavenly air A little lonesome Soul Seeks everywhere its mother  Frances Shaw   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  SPRING  A flicker of leaves Across my book And a quavering bird note Call me To the window And there Is Spring Laughing up the slope With jonquils In her hair And teasing the thrush Because his song Is rusty  MADRIGAL  My thoughts are flocks of little birds  That sing upon my lips all day  Gaily they wing their joyous way  My thoughts are flocks of little birds  They have no need of empty words  To sweetly pipe their blissful lay  My thoughts are flocks of little birds  That sing upon my lips all day   Madrigal  Like dipping flight of little birds Aflash among the fragrant may More silver white than foamy curds Their wings make music all the day  No shepherd boy with pipe astray Flutes half so sweet among his herds As do my thoughts like little birds That sing their gladness all the day  Mabel Linn  BATHSHEBA  The place was evil Carelessly I gazed Upon the shameless three while one the eyes Of her who seemed the youngest searched my heart Pretty she was and wicked but her eyes Were more than half divine blue more than gray And infinitely sad and desperate Of all old virtue like the flickering orbs Of some lean wolf that haunts the misty glow Of hunter s fire and howls and moans for food incarnate yearning True the girl was not Honest or clean or good and yet those eyes A thin blue gray stick in my memory A woman with such eyes I could have loved Had love meant more to her and less to me  Robert Calvin Whitford   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  AT THE THREE FOUNTAINS  Here where God lives among the trees Where birds and monks the whole day sing His praises in a pleasant ease  O heart might we not find a home Here after all our wandering These gates are closed even on Rome  Souls of the twilight wander here Here in the garden of that death Which was for love s sake need we fear  How sharp with bitter joy might be Love s lingering last longed for breath Shut in upon eternity  Arthur Symons   LOVE  Whence hast thou come I have heard the night speak  through thee I have heard the winds cry out at thy coming I have known the silent earth draw near with thee  Thou hast brought close to me the terror of the skies Thou hast brought the fragrance of the white thorn blossom And the cold strange darkness of the sea  FOREBODING  Like a black shadow silence has fallen around us  There is no stir in the heather the birds are hushed  And in the sun s eye the broad wings of a hawk  Beloved I have seen a sword edged shadow between us  I have heard the feet of one who brings death  IN ABSENCE  I  O thorn tree shake thy blossoms upon the wind  Cover with leaves thy deep snow laden boughs  That swiftly may sweet crimson berries ripen   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  My love has sworn when leaves and blossoms are faded And thy bare branches are held blood red to the skies  He will kiss grief and longing away from my heart  II  The silver wings of the sea birds flash and go The sen trembles unveiling itself to the day  Why comest thou not Why must I wait for thee  Is love so gentle to thee that thou sleepest unwaking Is thy breath unhastened thy brow dry and untortured Dost thou rather seek the me in dreams than here on my  breast  The beating of my heart has nightlong shaken my body So great an anguish is ray longing that sight fails My limbs shudder with the bitterness of my desire  If thou hastenest not death were easier to me than this  III  Perchance I am truly dead at last beloved And my body is lying still in some quiet place And thou art weeping for me But I am one of the driven tormented dead Whom the cold darkness sunders for ever from rest And this that consumes my heart is the pain of hell   In Absence  IV  I remember thee O beloved as one dead remembers the living Faintly the sound of thy voice and thy laughter lingers about me Yet ever thy face is a star burning unquenched through my darkness  Too far I have left thee behind me to know if love be forgotten  For weeping and laughter and love have mingled their voices and ceased Only I hear the sound of great seas long since overpassed me  Lo I would sleep beloved lulled by uttermost silence Sleep with even thy face covered away and forgotten Lost in a sleep unbroken by dreams or love or awakening  Moireen Fox  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  EDITORIAL COMMENT  MARS HAS DESCENDED  MARS has descended from Olympus and is polic  ing the domain of our national life At once  everything becomes different All our emo  tions take on a change our outlook brightens  or darkens as the case may be Our desires clarify themselves or suffer greater bewilderment our wills slacken or intensify themselves In a word we are remade That which the intuitionists foresee comes to pass A profound psychology is shot through us We begin to move as one man feel as one man A spiritual unity electrifies us We seem to be obeying the voice of God Noble impulses such as love for mankind love for democracy passionate eagerness for individual and national sacrifice flame in our hearts Visions of a regenerated world a universal democracy a nobler humanity visions of a spiritual awakening at home flash their sun lit wings before our eyes For Mars has descended and is walking among us  He jostles the Muses singing and dancing in the Sacred grove He plucks the short strings from the lyre of Apollo He enters the market and scatters the traders He grabs the boy in the pool room snatches the cigarette from his mouth and marches him out to enlist He routs the middle aged from places of comfort and commands them to tap unused strata of energy and to pursue life along higher and   Mars Has Descended  more strenuous levels He says to the old Nothing is required of you live or die as it may happen But to the old who have been soldiers he says Tell them what I am what I have done for you He takes Venus by the shoulder as a magnanimous policeman arrests a girl picket No time now for the lascivious pleasing of lutes Shakespeare knew the ways of the invincible giant It is war And all the gods and goddesses by command of high heaven are under the rule of Mars Logic reason intellection fall down They are the superstructures built it almost seems by man out of that deeper self the will the soul which controls juries political parties religious movements and nations moving to war therefore oriented to the use of solidarity  What does this What is it Is it the voice of God Is there an end to which we are guided Is there only a middle ground in the ages ahead a relative value there toward which our natures instinctively move and to which they emotionally react Who knows This cannot be judged by the reason And fire cannot analyze itself One thing is clear we must act Men cannot pause except in death if they do there And this is the secret Amid this Pyrrhonism shines this star  During the short term of Congress in 1861 many senators made speeches on the problem raised by the then seceded states as to what could be done or should be done As it is now so it was then the logician parted company with those who were acting by faith or through feeling Senator   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Douglas argument was most elaborate of all What can legally be done he asked The States have seceded and legally seceded What constitutional power can bring them back against their will None could and none did The vision of The Union melted the shadows and shattered the cobwebs of logic Mars had descended And now who will listen to the protests of Senator Stone and Senator La Follette that Great Britain and Germany are in pari delicto as respects us and our rights Only a minority at best Who counts the cost of blood and treasure for this adventure Only the few For in calculating the gains and losses of a course like this who is wise enough to see where the balance tips If democracy is menaced by Prussianism and we are for democracy why not destroy Prussianism What wiser thing is there to do in this world Indeed nothing is Quixotic for the World Spirit If we had to fight the whole world for democracy why not do it Here lies the fundamental question There is an ideal but it clothes the unrest of life the aspiration for a solution of life As Schopenhauer points out life s problem is how to escape boredom This is no frivolous statement If it sounds so the profound truth behind it robs it of frivolity  Now that we are in the war may heaven give us a thorough house cleaning abroad and at home Let us have a world clean up economically and spiritually But let us indulge the selfishness of doing something for ourselves while overturning the throne of the Hohenzollerns May we be lifted on the way through this war to the becoming of a   Mars Has Descended  truth living and a truth telling race Let us become real Do you O Mars rout crookedness out of our business social and political life It is time for every one to set about the business of abolishing poverty along fundamental lines All superficial remedies should go Do you O Mars destroy the Age of Bluff in this republic with its fakeries its imitations its shallow philanthropies its apings Take Plutus and chuck him in chains If we are strong enough to help the Allies let us be strong enough to be ourselves as human beings as artists Smash with your terrific club the rotten towers of superstition cut down the vine on which sophistry and greed have engrafted political power and financial advantage If the dream of God cannot be put to better use than these things take away the dream The spirit of man must  be free The aeroplane should be the precursor of wings for the soul of the race  And you O young boys of eighteen and twenty athletic and fearless eager for battle leaving this strange mixture of tragedy and comedy for the immediacy of Eternal Presences Death and the Great Inspirations may your blood be the atonement for us and for ours to come You will pass in such numbers over the threshold between this life and what is beyond that the great echo of your steps may give us the proof that death is not death and that this Reality here is a Dream and yours the Reality Whatever it be we cannot hold to any materialism of death when you have fallen That conception must go with all that is done for it and in its name Even the death of the body that event   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  which is made horrific by some religions and in so doing is also made the source of their diversified influence this must be blotted from our reckonings The graveyard must be abolished With wars over the world tearing to pieces the trappings of a stale carnival with the man of science ready to clasp the hand of the man of vision a great hour seems ready to strike A new Revelation struggles to break through the mists and announce himself to man For he who has found voices in the air through the wireless is not yet to be stayed in his upward climb In the realm of Thought lies the great message of man s destiny Its code badly understood its vibrations but partly heard have nevertheless agitated the world from all times But who will say that an ear rightly tuned cannot deliver this message letter by letter and word by word Edgar Lee Masters  COLONIALISM AGAIN  A just and even course being impossible in this world of passion and prejudice we Americans find it difficult to avoid on the one hand that loud voiced provincialism which overestimates the local product and on the other that soft voiced colonialism which deprecates it taking for granted its inferiority to that of elder and therefore wiser states  Time was when the typical American had to feel either boastful or apologetic even about our scenery He was either pointing with pride in a grandiose gesture to Niagara or doubting whether the Yosemite could be justly compared   Colonialism Again  with the Alps That particular attitude has passed our mountains and cataracts are now permitted to speak for themselves Again for a time we were tremulous about our industries inventions and other evidences of activity in commerce but these also no longer suggest to us the European comparison  It is only or perhaps we should say it is chiefly in the arts that the old assertive or deprecatory gestures may still be discerned Having taken for granted our commercialism and materialism until any achievement in their name becomes a matter of course we are still moved to self suspicion by art We can not yet take it on its merits judge it honestly for ourselves as if it were sheep or potatoes but must needs either brag or apologize or timorously suspend judgment until the arrival of the foreign verdict  On the whole provincialism is better than colonialism it is better to brag than apologize The indigenous artist inspiring the brag may be crassly cheap in which case both he and the brag will be extinguished with no great harm done or he may happen to be Mark Twain in which case the brag becomes the first note in the world s chorus of praise a note due to the young artist from his neighbors and most encouraging in his ear The brag which usually comes from the average citizen may be over generous but it is not hesitating and timid It is the word of a man or a crowd not afraid to speak its own mind even if a bit too anxiously with a chip on the shoulder attitude  In colonialism on the contrary there is no generosity and   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  no courage The deprecatory apologetic attitude toward contemporary American art is more often to be found in the academic mind the uncreative mind trained upon the past and living upon formulae And as such minds with of course starry exceptions make up the faculties of our universities much so called enlightened public opinion the public opinion of educated people accepts their leadership as authoritative and makes little attempt to challenge it and exercise independent judgment  Almost every season for example there are poets straight from England reading or lecturing in these parts This is as it should be of course we can not get too well acquainted But why a certain added deference toward the Englishmen as compared with Americans of equal or superior quality a deference shown not only by complimentary amenities of one kind or another but by the greater number of engagements at higher prices than are offered to the native bards Why for example does a Dakota college summon Mr Gibson when it has never so far as we know offered any recognition to American poets who outrank him  National lines should not be drawn too rigidly in the arts perhaps but such acts of snobbishness tempt one to comparisons Probably never since this country was a nation need she fear less than now such comparison between her rising or newly risen poets and those of Great Britain One of ours Mr Masters has succeeded in fusing the life of a whole region and period into a masterpiece of most original quality and epic value will any one venture to predict for   Colonialism Again  any of Mr Masefield s metrical narratives or anything else of that kind written by any contemporary Britisher as long a life as for the Spoon River Anthology  Again Mr Frost has given us dramatic narratives of New England life so vitally intuitive in their psychology so profoundly and poetically imagined of an art so delicately austere that we should not know where to look for his peer on the other side of the water Beside his highly individualized living characters Mr Gibson s seem puppets the theoretic projections of a studious intelligent persistent mind achieving a level forceful but somewhat over mechanized art  Also as an interpreter of life more or less localized a producer let us say since there is always a sense of pageantry in his art who is there in England to place beside Mr Lindsay Who has so keen a sense of the glory of life in and through and underneath its fantastic rags and splendors Who sees so clearly its many colored symbols its veiled lightnings its blue immensities and presents his vision in an art so simple and spontaneous and yet so studied and sure an art which creates its own mythology as it were rejecting all time worn systems of the elder world  Of course England or rather Great Britain has Mr Yeats She has still fortunately Mr A E Housman The Shropshire Lad with whom we might match the late Emily Dickinson as almost his contemporary at least in publication She has Mr D H Lawrence whose marvellous intuition of human feelings and reactions is expressed in a lyricism as searching and musical as Paganini s indeed POETRY A Magazine of Verse  his art is not unlike the almost unendurable poignancy of a master violinist She has those two purple winged Celts Messrs Padraic Colum and James Stephens She has Mr Walter de la Mare who has given us a few lyrics of extraordinary beauty But are any of these recent British songs more magical or more original and personal in their music than certain free verse lyrics of Mr Ezra Pound or Mr Carl Sandburg And among the English free verse poets whether in the imagist group or not who has the quality of these or of those two American imagists Mr John Gould Fletcher and H D  The comparison need not be pushed further if American critical and cultural authorities would only do their own thinking it would not have to be emphasized at all  The most flagrant recent instance of colonialism on the part of a group of people in authority was the award last year by Yale University of the Henry Howland memorial prize of fifteen hundred dollars for distinguished achievement in literature to not Rupert Brooke since he was not on earth to receive it but to his heirs  In the first place such a prize belongs to the living Any post mortem award however just otherwise is the mere expression of an afterthought the tardy endorsement of an account definitely closed by death If the prize is to have any constructive or provocative value it should be adventurously given not only to the living but to the most living among our present day literary artists to some man or woman still in the arena to whom it would be an immediate   Colonialism Again  encouragement and possibly an immediate financial help  Second it should be given to an American In England there are government pensions for men of letters and other suitable rewards This little biennial purse given by Yale is hardly a Nobel Prize to make a noise throughout the world rather it should be regarded as an opportunity to assert our faith in our own and make life a little more joyous for some poet we have faith in  By awarding this prize to the memory of Rupert Brooke one of the oldest American universities puts itself on record as believing that two or three sonnets re expressing a mediaeval ideal of heroism outweigh in importance the work of Mr Masters of Mr Frost or of any other American poet however forward looking his vision however rich his music It puts itself on record as bound to the past as a docile recorder of emotional English opinion as unaware of the trend of modern thought and art blind to what is going on around us H M  WORDS AND THE POET  An Address Delivered to the Poets Club of London December 1916  In all psychology there are few things so interesting and certainly nothing so important as the working of the spirit of the poet A poem is the finest achievement of the human spirit the manner of its coming into being the most impor   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  tant theme of which the science of the spirit can treat  The appreciation of poetry is the most personal thing in the world and it is forever changing It changes not only with each generation of men but it changes perpetually in each man The poems which move deeply a lover of poetry in his youth rarely move him as deeply in later life In the end probably only the finest poetry will move him at all if that is his spirit has undergone its due training and purification in the ordeal of his life  Doubtless there are many lovers of poetry who will be deeply moved at sixty by the poem which moved them deeply at sixteen But these are lovers of poetry of the average men of the ruck and with the ruck great poetry has nothing to do Great poetry is not even for the few It is for the very few  But for my own part and in this matter I speak only for myself I shall all my life long demand that whatever idea the poet is expressing he shall find for it its fullest musical expression that he shall give me the most beautiful music of words All my life long I shall enjoy a few poems of Catullus more than all the Aeneid  For me the idea expressed by the poet is really of less  importance than the music of its expression I do not mean  at all that verses in which a trivial idea was most musically  expressed would have any importance for me They would  not move me A poet does not express trivial ideas If he  did he would not be a poet But I do not hesitate to assert  that if a noble idea fails to obtain its full musical expression   Words and the Poet  it had better have been expressed in prose Indeed it loses force if its poetical expression is not wholly admirable from the effect of pretentiousness produced by the unsuccessful attempt to express it in poetical form produces  The eternal opposition is not between the lovers of the verse of Mrs Post and the lovers of the poetry of Keats it is between the lovers of Keats and the lovers of Shelley between those who demand that a poet should all the while be busied with beauty and those who demand that he should chiefly be busied with ideas between those who hold that he is a seer because he is a poet and those who hold that he is a poet because he is a seer Between these there is an infrangible barrier and like all the truly infrangible barriers it is wrought of bars finer than gossamer  The failure to find the full musical expression of their ideas spoils utterly for me some of the most highly esteemed poets of recent years They leave me quite cold And I have a strong feeling that their failure is their own fault Either in an access of modernitis seeking at any cost to be new and fearing lest the accusation should be brought against their music that it is an echo of the music of dead poets they have shrunk with such abhorrence or such timidity from fine melody that they have fallen to the opposite fault and gotten their music thin or even discordant  For example in all the work of Walter De La Mare Francis Thompson and John Masefield I believe that nothing moves me but De La Mare s poem The Listener But then its music is not thin The idea is uncommonly subtile   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and delicate and it finds expression in a subtile and delicate music In the other two it may be merely a failure of poetic genius Indeed Francis Thompson somewhere bewails the fact that his muse was a sullen mistress But I have a feeling that it is not wholly a failure of poetic genius but that they have deliberately refrained from the full musical expression of their ideas that they are in truth akin to those modern musicians who strive with so strenuous a cleverness to produce music without melody  It is all a part of that queer malady Modernitis with its queer striving to produce something new Of course every great poet has produced something new Genius always does produce something new whatever its sphere thought beauty or action Newness is a very hall mark of genius But that newness is never the result of a deliberate attempt to produce something new In poetry and art it is the result of striving for beauty Beauty attained is always a new thing Indeed the moment you set out to produce something new you confess yourself second rate  On the other hand there are few men more tiresome than the verse writer he is never a poet who expresses his ideas in other men s music and it is the ordinance of heaven that his ideas shall be as original as the music he steals It may be that the music of Swinburne is as the music of Gounod but when another man expresses his ideas in Swinburne s music his music is as the music of Herman Finck Yet it is little less tiresome to have no music at all  Now do not suppose that I demand a luscious music   Words and the Poet  There is more than one poem of Baudelaire or of Villon for which I would cheerfully give all the orotundities of Victor Hugo And for the lines  I ara a part of all that I have met Yet all experience is an arch where through Gleams that untravel d world whose margin fades For ever and for ever when I move  I would cheerfully give all the Idylls of the King There an eternal idea finds its full musical expression and the music is quiet  Neither again do I always demand the great idea nor even the very clear idea I get my fill of emotion and after all it is the function of poetry to move me from lines in which the idea is almost mystical from such a stanza as  And through the hours of night the jewelled foam Torn by the winds from the adventurous seas Flies back before my galleons driving home To heap their treasure on the magic quays I may not sleep till high upon their spars I see the pale hand of the morning gleam I need not sleep for love has won the stars To make the world my dream  And that brings me to the root of the matter to the magic and mystery of words  We have lived in a stupid and ignorant age besotted by the ideals of all the tradesmen an age which has forgotten if indeed it ever knew that words are magical things that there is a lost word which could a man but find it would make him master of the stars in their courses and controller of the sun In this magic of words the poet must be an adept  In the dark ages it was believed that Virgil was a great   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  enchanter and that legend held the truth It is not enough for the poet to delight and teach us he must also be an enchanter and enchant us opening for us the path to ecstasy  And how rarely does he rise to that height  I remember once a writer of verse telling me at the end of dinner with gentle satisfaction that he must now be going home for he proposed to write six hundred lines of poetry that evening Six hundred lines of poetry in an evening None of the great poets has written six hundred lines of poetry in six years I doubt that I could find six hundred lines of poetry in the Odyssey Some of the greatest poets have produced a hundred lines of verse for every line of poetry they wrote I sometimes wonder if any great poet ever wrote thirty consecutive lines of poetry  How then does a poet become an adept in the magic of words and rise himself enchanted to the height of enchanting others  I believe that the chief fact in his development is that he lives very much with words Indeed he lives far more with words than with ideas He is forever considering words brooding upon them enjoying them appraising them accepting them rejecting them It is only natural that after a while his underself should become a surging sea of words striving to burst up through the barrier into his consciousness Often I suspect they are battling with one another the poor and ugly words hindering the emergence and forcing back the beautiful words to the infinite distress of the   Words and the Poet  poet for that battle between words is the main part of his  travail Sometimes the right words the beautiful words  gain the victory and flow up into his consciousness Then  himself enchanted by them he rises to the height of enchant  ing others and opens for them the path to ecstasy  For the aim of all enchantments is ecstasy that standing  outside oneself in a freedom always too brief a freedom from  the prison of the flesh  Of all the means of producing ecstasy the true ecstasy I account the ecstasies induced by wine or drugs spurious ecstasies man has found words the most potent The enchanter enchanted himself and his disciples by the sound of words by sonorous incantations prolonged They were a chief part of the processes of magic The Roman church wisest of the churches induces the religious ecstasy by the sound of words literally by the sound of words chanted or muttered in a forgotten tongue And she reinforces that sound with music and incense even as the chanter reinforced his incantations with the scent of burning herbs sweet or pungent The oriental saint induces his religious ecstasy by gazing at his navel and murmuring the word Om till the bonds of the flesh fall from him The poet uses words in the same manner as the enchanter and the religious to induce ecstasy in himself and set the feet of others on the path to it  Words then are magical things and I have more than a suspicion that it is not the poet who is the master of words but words who are the masters of the poet The poet does not make his poems nearly so much as his poems make them   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  selves He begins with the idea doubtless Where does it come from Assuredly not from his conscious intelligence Then come the words and they build up and beautify the idea almost out of its original semblance For words so beautiful that they have lingered on the tongues of the generations have acquired exquisite significances and illuminating connotations They have become powers drawing to themselves other beautiful words growing together into poems The spirit of the poet is their vehicle his brain may join their fiats but no straining effort of his conscious intelligence built the structure It came from his underself  Consider in this matter the amazing significance of Kubla Khan It is one of the finest achievements of Coleridge and he did not write it He wrote it down If anything ever came out of a man s underself that did His conscious intelligence was in abeyance during its coming to birth  I believe that that happens in the case of all poetry Often I believe that the poet writes verse as a preparation writing on and on to tune his spirit as it were Then the moment comes he yields himself almost passively to the magic words whose flow this preparation has made easier and the poem rises like the towers of Ilion He is no more than the vehicle and the true poetic frenzy is uncommonly like a trance Edgar Jepson   REVIEWS  THAT WILDER EARTH  Wild Earth and Other Poems by Padraic Colum Henry Holt amp Co Padraic Colum is one of the most gifted if not the most  gifted of the younger Irish poets James Stephens I think has never surpassed his first small book Insurrections Was it not more distinctive was it not more Irish than any that he has published since Some of the other younger Irish poets have seemed to echo Mr W B Yeats as was indeed quite natural but Mr Colum by no means wears the mantle of the older poet Whereas Mr Yeats own dreams are usually reflected in his poems representing peasant life or whereas Mr Yeats almost always sees the peasant through the glamour of old mythologies Mr Colum gives us the peasant as nearly as possible in the peasant s own terms and with a direct concrete touch Of course the distinction is not water tight nor meant to be Mr Yeats old woman making the fire at dawn when the seed of the fire gets feeble and low is as direct as possible and Mr Colum s poems are not untouched by the glamour of tradition and the thought of white ships and the King of Spain s daughter How else could it be and he a poet  However the reader who turns to Mr Colum s poems with this distinction in mind will realize something of his   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  artistic method He has identified himself with his subject and his own personality is not obtruded except as it is incidentally revealed This is the method of genuine folk poetry be it Greek or Irish or of any race at all Such poetry has the solidity of life of the hills or of the earth itself and the title Wild Earth is indeed appropriate This title it may be mentioned is taken from a smaller collection of poems a little brown book issued by Maunsel in 1909 which I remember with regret I lent it to a lady who was expecting a visit from Padraic Colum According to her he took the book and cut it up for copy for the present volume In this edition I therefore recognize something of my own lost property in several of the poems Among these are A Ploughman A Drover and An Old Woman of the Roads which have been quoted in several anthologies  I do not mean to indicate by what I have said that Mr Colum s poems are entirely objective or that being objective in method they do not serve to convey subjective and personal emotions There are many beautiful poems in the book that give us the sense of personal vision and passion The Wayfarer published in POETRY is one of these There is much primal feeling I know no other way to name it in all that this poet writes His poems take hold of earth and do not let go This is a feeling which does not recognize division between nature and man or between man and man It is a feeling which makes ridiculous the publisher s paragraph on the cover of this book The poems in this volume are among the best recent attempts to get into the hearts of   That Wilder Earth  the simplest poor to exalt them by truth and not by condescension They express no surprise at finding greatness in the humble Isn t that paragraph appalling Yes appalling  The Irish have that tenacity of primitive feeling and understanding of life that depth which makes culture possible which is retained by only a few peoples as against system and efficiency and all that sterilizes experience characteristic of the dominant nations today This is what makes Irish literature so rich and vital when it is consistently self expressive Poets of other races seem to have to acquire or to be especially gifted with what an Irishman has naturally a sense that is of the real values of life which easily becomes poetic as against an artificially fostered appreciation which may be merely literary If the smaller races are doomed in the general trend of what we call civilization then civilization is that much poorer  Among the new poems published in this book The Old Men Complaining with its hint of Mr Yeats old men by the thorn trees but in an entirely original vein is one of the finest It gives us the old men railing against the waste luxury and idleness of youth an eternal theme  I heard them speak The old men heavy on the sod Letting their angers come Between them and the thought of God  The Three Spinning Songs and The Ballad of Downal Bawn  have delightful rhythm In short Mr Colum is an artist  with the conscientiousness of a thorough craftsman and his   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  touch is always authentic I have not mentioned his humor which makes him doubly sympathetic of course there is no real sympathy without humor but that goes without saying His work is a definite contribution to Irish literature it is a permanent contribution to English poetry A C H  MORE STORIES IN VERSE  Livelihood by Wilfrid Wilson Gibson Macmillan Co  Those who have enjoyed Mr Gibson s other books will find their expectations not disappointed in Livelihood with its friendly working people its stories of their hardships their fortitude and humble satisfactions  There is a certain monotony in the poet s method of storytelling His dramatic instinct and experience lead his plots toward compactness but otherwise have a limiting cramping influence An adherence to the old dramatic unities seems to dominate the poems Each story may show on its stage only one period of time one place of action and more than that the author for further bondage has added an extra unity of his own that the characters in the story be limited to one The other characters appear through this one through his meditating recollection It is through this meditation that we learn of the character s past life what he has been before the curtain rose after it has risen the hero is alone on the stage save for the wraiths that outline themselves from his talk and the scene does not change One scene one character that is the rule Two of the sketches   Alore Stories in Verse  are exceptions having each a pair of characters but even in these the author s habit is always obliging him to handle one person at a time so that there is an effect of balancing balls and when one is up the other is down or lost  In poem after poem this same one man one scene method is carried out till it grows irksome There is a sameness too in the atmosphere the sympathy with which Gibson surrounds his characters One grows tired of its sweetness and wholesome ness It is to be hoped that a poet of so much power as Mr Gibson will not let his art unaware drift into habits of either form or feeling H H  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  OTHERS REDIVIVUS  Others contrary to the fears of its lovers has not ceased publication but still continues to shed its undimmed light upon a sombre world At one time it is true there was talk of suspending for lack of funds but this misfortune was averted and the lack of an October and a November number was made up for by the size and quality of the one which appeared in December This number
