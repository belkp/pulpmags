such flesh as shows Nothing but easy nature and his wife The woman s daughter who spills all her talk  Out of a wide mouth but who has eyes as gray As Connemara where the mountain ash Shows berries red indeed they enter now Our country singers  Sing my good woman sing us some romance That has been round your chimney nooks so long Ti s nearly native something blown here And since made racy like yon tree I might say Native by influence if not by species Shaped by our winds You understand I think   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I ll sing the song sir  To night you see my face Maybe nevermore you ll gaze  On the one that for you left his friends and kin For by the hard commands Of the lord that rules these lands  On a ship I ll be borne from Cruckaunfinn  Oh you know your beauty bright Has made him think delight  More than from any fair one he will gain Oh you know that all his will Strains and strives around you till  As the hawk upon his hand you are as tame  Then she to him replied I ll no longer you deny  And I ll let you have the pleasure of my charms For to night I ll be your bride And whatever may betide  It s we will lie in one another s arms  You should not sing With body doubled up and face aside There is a climax here It s we will lie Hem passionate And what does your daughter sing  A song I like when I do climb bare hills Tis all about a hawk  No bird that sits on rock or bough Has such a front as thine   No king that has made war his trade Such conquest in his eyne I mark thee rock like on the rock Where none can see a shape I climb but thou dost climb with wings And like a wish escape  She said And like a wish escape  No maid that kissed his bonny mouth Of another mouth was glad Such pride was in our chieftain s eyes Such countenance he had But since they made him fly the rocks Thou creature art my quest Then lift me with thy steady eyes If then to tear my breast  She said If then to tear my breast  The songs they have Are the last relics of the feudal world Women will keep them byzants doubloons When men will take up songs that are as new As dollar bills What song have you young man  A song my father had sir It was sent him From across the sea and there was a letter with it Asking my father to put it to a tune And sing it all roads He did that in troth And five pounds of tobacco were sent with the song   To fore reward him I ll sing it for you now  The Baltimore Exile  The house I was bred in ah does it remain Low walls and loose thatch standing lone in the rain With the clay of the walls coming through with its stain Like the blackbird s left nest in the briar  Does a child there give heed to the song of the lark As it lifts and it drops till the fall of the dark When the heavy foot kine trudge home from the paurk Or do none but the red shank now listen  The sloe bush I know grows close to the well And its long lasting blossoms are there I can tell When the kid that was yeaned when the first ones befell Can jump to the ditch that they grow on  But there s silence on all Then do none ever pass On the way to the fair or the pattern or mass Do the gray coated lads drive the ball through the grass And speed to the sweep of the hurl  O youths of my land Then will no Bolivar Ever muster your ranks for delivering war Will your hopes become fixed and beam like a star Will they pass like the mists from your fields  The swan and the swallows the cuckoo and crake May visit my land and find hillside and lake And I send my song I ll not see her awake I m too old a bird to uncage now   Silver s but lead in exchange for songs But take it and spend it  We will And may we meet your honor s like Every day s end  A tune is more lasting that the voice of the birds  A song is more lasting than the riches of the world  Padraic Colum  NOTE The last stanza in the first ballad sung is a fragment of an old country song the rest of it with the other two ballads is invented But they are all in the convention of songs still sung by strolling ballad singers I have written the common word for pasture field paurk so as not to give a wrong association it might be written park as Bums using the word in the same sense writes it Paurk or park is Gaelic for pasture field and is always used in Irish country speech in that sense The two last lines spoken are translations of a Gaelic phrase which has been used by Dr Douglas Hyde as a motto for his collection of Connacht love songs P C   POEMS  TH E RAGPICKER  The Ragpicker sits and sorts her rags Silk and homespun and threads of gold She plucks to pieces and marks with tags And her eyes are ice and her fingers cold  The Ragpicker sits in the back of my brain Keenly she looks me through and through One flaming shred I have hidden away She shall not have my love for you  THE BECKONING MOON  I went to the hills for courage But the hills have made me weak I went to the hills for high resolves And the wisest words to speak  There were bonfires down in the valley And a beckoning moon in a tree So I sped a flame winged messenger To call you back to me  THE CITY LIGHTS FROM A SKYSCRAPER  From my high window at the fall of night I see the low hung firmament of light   Like port holes of a ship afloat in space Or danger signals in a hidden place  An iridescent serpent with black jaws A banner tattered in a giant s cause  A sun touched river winding through the gloom Wild writing on the heavens of a doom  Or just the cottage candles in a wood Where children play together and are good  THE HARP OF THE WIND  My house stands high Where the harp of the wind Plays all day Plays all night And the city light Is far away  Where hangs the harp that the winds play High in the air Over the sea  The long straight streets of the far away town Where the lines of light go sweeping down Are the strings of its minstrelsy   And the harp of the wind Gives to the wind A song of the city s tears Thin and faint the cry of a child Plaint of the soul unreconciled A song of the passing years  TH E ORGAN ANGELS  They gather the winds that they may sound His greater glory through the vaulted sky They make soft melodies to flow together Before God a mighty stream  SILENT ONES  I like silent people I like to hear them speak Because their voices come from the silences Of their own souls I seem to hear the sound Of windless forests And of still waters Which wrapt the earth before the day of man They know not however what they speak But I who dwell in the roar of many streets I who listen hear   THREE VOICES  The Tree  A wind of pain and longing Strips my boughs of their spring time I bow and rock and sweep the ground Then in the silence hold me listening  Is this the after calm in life Or is it death  The Spirit Within  I loved a warrior once And gave my heart in the spring time Lonely I sought the whole world o er For one glance more Unseeing he passed by And then I laid me down within this tree  And slept  The Wind  Bow bow your branches O tree And sigh exceedingly that the Spirit within May have memories of me  For I am he who passed her by In the spring time  Frances Shaw   O BROTHER TREE  O brother tree O brother tree Tell to me thy brother The secret of thy life The wonder of thy being  My brother tree my brother tree My heart is open to thee Reveal me all thy secrets  Beloved tree beloved tree I have shattered all my pride I love thee brother as myself Oh explain to me thy wonders  Beloved one adored one I will not babble of it among fools I will tell it only to the unspoiled Reveal to me thy being  I have watched thy leaves in sunshine I have heard them in the storm My heart drank a droplet of thy holy joy and wonder One drop from the ocean of thy wonder  I am thy humble brother I am thine own Reveal thy life to me Reveal thy calm joy to me Reveal to me thy serene knowledge   THE BIRD  From a branch The bird called  I hold your heart I wash it And scour it With bits of song Like pebbles And your doubts And your sorrows Fall drip drip drip Like dirty water I pipe to it In little notes Of life clear as a pool And of death Clearer still And I swoop with it In the blue And in the nest Of a cloud  Max Michelson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  HAUNTED REAPING  Out we go in the dusk of morn Over the hills to the reaping Our sickles crash on the golden corn When the rest of earth is sleeping Bending and bowing bending and bowing Gathering in and striking free Gripping the sheaf with the sickle and knee And laying it down for the tying  The dim dark hills are all around The silence breeds a sullen dread Our sickle strokes like shrieks resound In chambers of the murdered dead But one dull star stays overhead The waning moon seems all awry The dying night is loth to die Though in the east the mists are red  Over the stubble chill winds creep Like breaths from a dead world blowing God it is awesome so to reap With such strange fancies growing Bending and bowing bending and bowing Gathering in and striking free Gripping the sheaf with sickle and knee And laying it down for the tying   Haunted Reaping  My father reaps six feet before With hairy arms as hard as steel I hear the corn as oft of yore Before his whirlng sickle reel And God what wild mad horrors steal Bidding me take too long a stride And drive my sickle in his side And grind his face beneath my heel  I dread this brooding awful morn With its haunted hush dismaying It seems as though pale souls newborn Our curved wet blades were slaying Bending and bowing bending and bowing Gathering in and striking free Gripping the sheaf with the sickle and knee And laying it down for the tying  My father s beard is grizzled gray It trails like mist in heavy wind He was three score yesterday And yet I reap six feet behind Lean he is and bent and lined And he has held me many years And still I toil in hate and tears And still he swears that he is kind  Ah God will morning never break I know he is old and loving   Yet I hear with every stroke I make A demon with me moving Bending and bowing bending and bowing Gathering in and striking free Gripping the sheaf with sickle and knee And laying it down for the tying  At last The morning comes at last The hills are rich with filtered gold And through the vales a glory vast In glowing might is swiftly rolled And hard my father s hand I hold And standing midst the gleaming corn With him thank Heaven for the morn With lips that still are gray and cold  THE MUSE IN CHURCH  The gates of brass are closed That guard the ivory altar The great arched rafters frown on thee Who art the harlot s daughter With lips like a carmine rose With robes like orchids rare With breath like spices delicate That languorous pagans bear With thy petal cheeks aglowing   And with thy white knees showing  And shy soft eyes that falter  Go hence enticing demon child  Thou hast not beads nor psalter Leyland Huckfield  THE RETURN  Back to the voice that sang me Back to the breath of birth Back to the bells that rang me From heavenly heights to earth Back to the hand that wrought me Back to the primal sod Back to the mind that thought me Home to the breast of God  Louise Ayres Garnett   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ECCE MYSTERIUM  The voice of the city  Boy there in the candle light Take your silver flute and sing See Outside the lamps are bright Burning flashing rioting  Sounds are in the city street  Take your silver flute and sing Music of a million feet Plodding dancing faltering  The boy takes up his flute and points toward the river  Passers by O passers by  Come to the rim of the windy sky  See you the silver shimmering street  Where the bricks and river meet  There s the path I go to follow oh to follow  Up the dusk dimmed mountain s hollow  Where little roads lead higher higher  Into the white white heart of fire  Passers by O passers by Do you hear the sob in the wind wide sky  A hurdy gurdy plays between the tenements and a balloon man passes with bright red blue and orange balloons tugging at their strings The voice of the city roaring   Boy snuff out your candle light Bid your flute now cease to sing See outside the lamps are bright Blazing flashing rioting  Rebecca Park Lawrence   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FIRE OF SNOW  Pale fire of snow had lit the dusk for me Astray with mind half consciously intent I had not thought the wood so imminent  Those lofty trees upstanding wearily  Darker than sleep more mute with mystery Than far off death where questing dreams are spent With stars and winds appeared they as I went  Therein and paused in old expectancy  Pale fire of snow had lit the dusk for me But the black stillness held where once the wind Had parted boughs in music that the gleam Of stars might enter All was strangely blind  More dull than midnight neath the middle sea Filled with the silence of a perished dream  IN THE WIND  Lo in the wind what legions pass Phantom innumerable fleet Watching I dream their pauseless feet  Are lights that run upon the grass  Clark Ashton Smith   COTTON FIELDS  Like nets of brown by fisher folk Spread out to dry in wind and sun While in the harbor idly wait The boats for schools of fish to run  So lie the ripened cotton fields Along the slopes The sun has browned And curled their leaves the rows stretch out Enlaced with knots along the ground  Above the rough red field of earth Soft flecks of white droop from the bolls Far off the groups of pickers loom Like burdened disembodied souls  Detached but not released who haunt The fields and hover near the soil Gray gleaners in the weary rows Entangled in an endless toil  Madeline Yale Wynne   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  EARLY MORNING AT BARGIS  Clear air and grassy lea Stream song and cattle bell Dear man what fools are we In prison walls to dwell  To live our days apart From green things and wide skies And let the wistful heart Be cut and crushed with lies  Bright peaks And suddenly  Light floods the placid dell The grass tops brush my knee A good crop it will be  So all is well Oh man what fools are we In prison walls to dwell  Hermann Hagedorn   THE OLD SOUTH  To H D  High streaks of cottony white cloud fill the sky The sun slips out of the swamp swinging his heavy jewelled mace before his face as he plays with the ripples that gurgle under the rotting cypress knees The breeze lifts the Spanish moss an instant and then is still The sun tosses dew over the ragged palmetto leaves Aslant on a gust of warm breeze from the broiling savannah the song of a mocking bird floats a fierce scurry of notes through the air The sun seems to be kindling a flare at every point of the horizon Grasshoppers crickets cicadas everything that flits or skims tunes and trills its shrill violin Butterflies flutter broken motes of color humming bird and dragon fly dart green streaks through the quivering sky  The river rolls boiling and frothing through the lowlands It is weary of the dull stiff mud banks that flake away before it in sticky chips weary of the turbid masses of mud that it must scour away to make its path down to the sea It gulps and seethes horribly with hungry angry lips fretting first one bank then another as it goes sliding and flopping down the long twisted bends in the fierce glare of morning deceived no longer at each marsh outlet and creek and bayou mouth into thinking that here and not further south must be the clear blue water it seeks where its heavy burden may fall in peace The river goes slapping lapping rustling the canes   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of the brake and the motionless cypress trees A mockingbird s song floats down before it in the breeze  It is noon and the carnival king of fools rules the city A beautiful woman her face cold haughty expressionless the fire in her eyes half hidden goes dancing down the street with a man whose shape is like an ape Her feet stir the dust and it glitters as it settles in streams over her shoulders like slipping confetti showers She is a flower over weary of the sun Her perfume is almost gone and the fever will soon snap her from her stalk and toss her into the tomb Brass drums toll to her tripping movement Her skirts sway Amid their flickering spangles plays a satyr grinning at the multitude He tears off her frills and flings them into the gutter choked with filth Her half naked form writhes and recoils like a tree before the storm  The river frowns and lours for a heavy fuming dull blue shower races gloomily above it from the southward As it goes it throws out at the trees tentacles of curled coppey lightning that enlace and line the branches and send them crashing downwards with dull powdery explosions of muffled thunder The river lashes itself into fits smashing the bank with maddened fists as it spins the quivering steamer around and nearly sends it reeling aground It growls it howls it shouts its terror of the forest whose broken logs topple into it with a great splash swirling and whirling sucked and crashing in sudden black somersaults   while the storm roars and grumbles away with spattered hail bullets and noise of affray Now the forest groans and drips and shrieks with rain that whistles through its branches Every trickle every pool every creek is full The choked up torrent overflows and covers miles on miles of furrows and woods with endless glaring wastes of water A gaunt pine falls with a sigh and a splash  Slowly the river resumes its patient march through the lowlands Now autumn comes and afternoon seems throwing gray filaments of haze from tree to tree The old plantation sleeps for it has nothing else to do Live oaks are towered about it drooping heavily weary of holding up lusty green leaves from year to year In graves under the live oaks many are sleeping They have slipped from the dream of life to the dream of death Perhaps they died for a woman s sake for a sigh a chance word a look a letter for nothing or for a song that men sing What matter Life is a dream to day tomorrow yesterday it is the same Along old floors underneath mouldering doors blow light gusts of wind stirring the dust A mouse cheeps in a corner Old age creeps upon us and life is gray The old plantation moulders day on day Soon there will be gaps in the floors and the doors will swing open to all Let us doze on the levee and feel the breeze as it slips down the river racing past us  The river runs very fast for it is bearing sodden logs like broken lives The sleepy vultures line the gray cotton   woods that tower above its banks To them too life is a dream This morning they tore the rank carrion of a dead horse that floated down to them Death does not matter for life is defeat but it is very sweet to have plenty to eat and to sleep in the sunlight Sleeping and waking and sleeping again that is how one learns to live without pain Let autumn throw dim filaments of regret from tree to tree Leaves may drop slowly but the live oak which drops not its leaves at all is the tree that is planted on graves  Immortal death is very sweet  When brown leaves fill the dripping gap  Of a broken vault and the frightened feet  Of mice pit patter and owls flap  Out to the cool moonshiny night  Which scatters crushed jewels down the river  Where trees dumb stricken ghosts in flight  Chatter and shake against each other  Tinkle tinkle drop the rain that filters through the leaky roof Under the colonnade where slaves were sold and bars clinked with gold runs a tiny stream of water through the dust Was that a door slamming or only a torn hanging that flapped Who knows Perhaps it was two ghosts who chattered together through agued lips and rattling teeth Not a dusty bottle in the bar Marks of muddy boots on the smashed marble Wind that laughs insanely up the spiral stairways down the floorless corridors Let us go for rain is dropping and the roof is leaking and I seem to hear a gray frog hopping while yonder door is   creaking as if someone were locked behind it and were whispering to get out Let us go for the ceiling sags and will soon be falling and a black spider is crawling past my face and rags are drifting about on the floor Let us go for a crazy deaf woman with a bent stick threatens us in quavering voice declaring she will strike us for daring to enter her palace Let us go and not come back any more The dead are best dead and forgotten  The river rolls through fields blossoming with cotton day after day In a crazy cabin someone is crooning a song The sun lifts his long jewelled mace an instant in careless lazy fingers before his face and lets it slip away again Aslant on a chill scurry of rain floats a mocking bird s jangled song It dies away and leaves only silence half enclosing the monotonous drone of a sad hymn of despair which a sleepy negro is humming to himself from nowhere  NEW YORK  To Richard Aldington  Out of the black granite she is rising surprising as sunrise over the head of the Sphinx glittering towers coated in linked scales that seem as if they might melt away they are so pale but that day pours multitudes about them to smile and to threaten to sin and to scape the reckoning to coagu   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  late in iron knots against fate to blot out life s misery with rejoicing to clamor and to pray Restless hammers are carving new cities from the stagnant skies  Beneath the earth is propped and caverned monstrous halls drop with vaulted echoing roofs dripping and sorrowful far below the bells toll and the trains start slowly clanging shaking the earth and the sad towers above them as they go banging their cargo of lost ones towards the secret gates of the sea falling falling with thunder and flame roaring and crawling shooting and dying away  Restless hammers are carving new cities from the stagnant skies  Aloft red girders of riveted steel hang motionless over the abyss Down below the traffic slides and from precipitous sides unroll golden threads like spiders contriving carrying their freight Men with hammers are striving to hack new projections on the edifice and from the last impenetrable overhanging beam a man is dangling on his belly guiding the weight The clouds explode in hissing ripples of snow about him the skies are dim and the stream of life falls through them sighing like wheat that crashes into the hopper But the last pinnacles eat into the clouds and from their bronze sides pours down the day sweeping away the sordid flood of men in streams of weeping glory   New York  Restless hammers are carving new cities from the stagnant skies  Screaming and flickering like loosened floods of blue flame the streets run together amid the houses that huddle and leap and lower over them The houses quiver with rage and heat from heads to feet the façades seem wavering toppling tearing with their weight the glaring panes bulge outwards and the bent red girders ooze away beneath them But above it all above all the chaos the struggle and the loss the clouds part Ivory and gold heart of light petrified bold and immortally beautiful lifts a tower like a full lily stalk with crammed pollen coated petals flame calyx fretted and carven White phoenix that beats its wings in the light shrill ecstasy of leaping lines poised in flight partaker of joy in the skies mate of the sun  Restless hammers are carving new cities from the stagnant skies  John Gould Fletcher  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE YOUNGER BARDS  That delightfully whimsical anthologist Mr E V Lucas has recently stated that contemporary England has produced but two singers whose verse may be called magical Walter de la Mare and Ralph Hodgson Yet there is a nest of singing birds in England before whom Mr De la Mare and Mr Hodgson being wise and accomplished poets bow humbly And every year about twenty new voices swell their number If the essential magic of poetry is to be found anywhere it is in these unpremeditated verses  Dark and dreary was the night Not any star did gleam But over the hills a mysterious light Came like a fearful dream  And you could hear the maiden singing A sweet and old old song And the rafters of the hall were ringing While she was singing long  And now there came an ancient knight A riding up the hill And he would stop and think of the fight That the maid was singing still Donald Turner being only twelve years old is wiser than Wordsworth He has no need to ask self consciously Will no one tell me what she sings He knows He casually tossed off these lines without assistance one day in ten minutes It was suggested that he should write a poem on the word Hall which is the surname of one of his playmates and as a recreation from study he produced these quite magical lines   His friend Donald Wakeling who is also twelve years old and who has never read Blake was prompted by the word Cloudland to write a poem which no anthologist in the future can afford to overlook  High up in cloudland Ever so high You hear the birds whistle And the lark his cry  High up in cloudland Ever so high You hear the wind howl And the old moon sigh  Who taught this little boy to hear the old moon sigh  These lyrics chosen as representative rather than exceptional are the work of small boys in the Perse Grammar School at Cambridge England They are the result of systematic encouragement on the part of a teacher who believes that every child is a poet until he outgrows his childhood and that the only spur needed to produce creative work is the encouragement of the imagination and of a boy s faith in his own creative powers  Such poems as these and many more like them force us to ask ourselves whether the essential magic of poetry is not after all identical with the vision of childhood and if so whether we are not squandering the larger share of our imaginative inheritance by neglecting childhood s creative powers  The experience of Mr H Caldwell Cook the teacher of these boys has been that every boy is a potential poet   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  that if left to his own devices until his poem is finished it will be a better poem than if he is interrupted and that no little boy can correct the faults in his poem but that he can write a new poem in which these faults tend to disappear The poems which I have quoted have undergone no revision by the master It is also Mr Cook s experience that when his boy poets outgrow their childhood the majority lose their poetic faculty The important minority however have found their vocations early and developed many years sooner than would otherwise have been the case  Mr Cook advocates a minimum of technical instruction in prosody for the best work is done with the simplest rhythms and vocabulary He encourages the composition of poetry in the spirit of play and it is his belief founded on results that intuition is at least of equal value with tuition  The best of these poems are the normal play of normal matter of fact boys That their intuitions have no background of experience is the most wonderful fact about their work Adrian Tuffield with all the sage wisdom of his twelve years can feel intuitively what he tells you in the last couplet of The Skylark  He clears his voice with a sip of the dew That lies on the grass when the day is new Then spreads his wings and soars on high Till he s naught but a speck in the vast blue sky  His musical notes come fast and free In a strain of sweetest melody He pours them out so rich and clear That this thrilling song the world may hear   The Younger Bards  To guard the nest his mate must stay But her heart is cheered by his roundelay When sunset comes with its rosy glow He ll leave his heaven for his love below  And Douglas Simmonds who claims eleven years sings disillusionment with consummate artlessness in this Envoy which we cannot call a Song of Experience because of the author s tender age  The sun s last ray has left the sky The red has vanish d fast And now to rest the birds skim by These are the very last  The wind moans through the trees all bare Playing a mournful tune And now comes out with icy stare Night s mistress Lady Moon  It is this very foreknowledge of childhood which we have been permitting to slip away Edward J O Brien  To emphasize Mr O Brien s conclusions the editor offers also the following two groups of poems by children Alice O Henderson the daughter of William P and Alice Corbin Henderson of Chicago dictated her imagistic poems in exactly their present form between her sixth and eighth years In the poems of Richard Untermeyer who is now seven some of the phrases were transposed and rhymes added by his father Mr Louis Untermeyer  DICK  AS TO HEAVEN  Well Heaven s hard to understand But it s a kind of great big land  All full of gold and glory With rivers green and pink and red And houses made of gingerbread  Like in the fairy story  The floors they use are made of clouds And there are crowds and crowds and crowds  Who sing and dance till seven But then they must all keep still because God and the Dream man and Santa Claus  Sleep in the big House of Heaven  God he sleeps on the first two floors And the Dream man sleeps above him and snores  A tired out story teller And Santa Claus who hates the noise He sleeps on the roof with all of his toys  And the angels live in the cellar  Now the angels never sleep a wink They re much too busy to stop to think  Or play on harps and guitars They re always cleaning the sun at night And all day long to keep it bright  They polish the moon and the stars  They clean the streets and they tidy the rooms And they sweep out heaven with a million brooms  And they hurry each other when they nod And they work so fast that they almost fall But God just sits and never works at all  And that s because he s God 1   AS TO GOD  Well God does nothing all day long But he sits and sits in his chair His face is as silver and big as the moon  And he wears all the stars in his hair He s very large and happy and he s very very old And half his hair is purple and the other half is gold  He wears no crown but a big tall hat With feathers three miles high And they have a hundred colors that are far more bright  Than all the other colors in the sky And they re tied to his hat with a kind of velvet rag And right in the middle of them all he wears a great big  American flag  AS TO TRUTHS  They always said the moon was far away A hundred miles or more up on the skies They said he never could come down to play They said a lot of things that sounded wise  But they were lies So when they said the moon is dead I did not even shake my head I only laughed because I know  It isn t so  Only the other night I watched and saw how light He leaped down from the skies And then with crinkling eyes That seemed to say I m coming He danced and started humming So gaily and so brightly That Wendy who sleeps lightly She s our canary woke And scolded when she spoke But on he came so near That he could almost peer   Into my room and see Wendy the toys and me Closer he came until His hands were on the sill They stretched and tried to get My pail my soldier set And as he touched my broom He jumped into the room I knew then right away He had come down to play And so without a word For mother might have heard Making no talk or noise We played with all my toys I never had such fun Before with anyone  After awhile he had to go I tired him I m afraid And then I knew why I liked him so When he played For his face as fat as a face could be Was jolly and powdered white And I knew why the stars had to wink when he Laughed all night I saw him dancing along a wall And jumping lightly down And I knew he wasn t a moon at all But a clown  So when they tell me corn starch makes you strong And sitting still is good for tired eyes I think that very likely they are wrong And lots of other things that sound so wise  Are only lies I think about the way they said The moon was far away and dead And then I laugh because I know  What isn t so  Richard Untermeyer   Ribbons in the Sun  RIBBONS IN THE SUN  I  The flowers are growing And every day I see them My heart is growing Like the chimney I see a lot of smoke I bet it s hot in the house I know I see you  Musical day music is going to be at the fair With Masquerinis in it And lots of people at the jostra The people sit in it  More I see is flowers The pictures all around the house It s Christmas tonight And won t I be dressed though pretty And happy days will come around Through one week  II The moon I see And how pretty the trees are growing One man was walking along the beach He was lovely dressed in a beautiful beautiful trouser suit Roses on where the buttons come  Flowers all around in one big circle People sat on chairs and a bon fire How pretty the moon is tonight  And happy days I see Pictures all around the house And I am dressed the prettiest way My mother s got a blue and white sashed dress And she looks lovely My friends all have pink dresses with pink sashes And the men are all dressed In black suits   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  III  How beautiful the Lake is Blue lake And pretty sunset Shining out And pretty trees all around That are green  IV  I am singing to thank you Jesus Christ For all the lovely things you did for us For all the clothes and things And all the good fathers and mothers  V Written Oct 15th 1914  War  The war kills little children always Who started the war did not care I think if I was the man that started the war I think that I never would have started it into such a war To kill poor little children  How They Burned Houses Down  They make all feel sorry And hope to send enough for them To make them live again and not to die They want warm they want to be hot They make all cry for they burn houses When they started I was not uncertain what they would do I knew they would hurt my whole heart  Breaking Down Beautiful Churches  I never wished that they were broken When so many men took all their time to make them beautiful Now they are down and will never be beautiful again Make them stop They ought to be careful where they are  dropping bombs If they drop another bomb on a beautiful place like this They will make me cry for years and years  Alice Oliver Henderson   COMMENTS AND REVIEWS  AERE PERENNIUS  THE minister read the Thanatopsis at the  memorial service in honor of Herbert Stuart  Stone whose gallantry in death on the Lusi  tania wrung the hearts of his friends and of all  who read of it It was Herbert Stone who back in the nineties first gave Chicago the lead in progressive publishing by offering to the astonished American public beautiful editions of Bernard Shaw s plays Richard Hovey s fine translation of Maeterlinck and Miss Hall s of Verlaine besides many most interesting American and English poets of the day And the young firm s little magazine The Chap book too short lived alas was not only witty and clever beyond all its contemporaries but it led them all in literary discernment and distinction  The Thanatopsis carried me still further back a century of American literature passed in review When the poem first appeared about the time of Waterloo it was also a shock to the conservatives for it challenged the prevalent pieties by its acceptance of nature s processes in life and death A century of discoveries and revolutions has not killed it even today its mood is significant and its rhythmic march has a stately beauty  As the minister s sonorous voice rolled out the lines I was reminded suddenly of something which happened during the last years of Bryant s long life A lady who cherished a deep   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  respect for poets was talking with a member of a famous New York firm of publishers Oh Bryant said this gentleman flippantly we call him the great national tone imparter his name on the title page of a book with a picture of his venerable head opposite will sell anything  Do you mean that he sells his name as the author of books he doesn t write said the shocked respecter of poets  As author or editor even so said the publisher And he mentioned Bryant s History of the United States Bryant s Collection of Poetry and Song and other good sellers as works to which the poet had given nothing but his name  This story always comes back to me when I make a détour from Fifth Avenue to see the beautiful rear façade of the New York Public Library Here a throned figure of the venerable poet faces the park named in his honor and offers us his life as a high inspiration to American youth To whose memory was the statue erected the poet of the Thanatopsis or the great national tone imparter If the former are we not honoring too much the man who did his best work at nineteen and if the latter are we not honoring too much the man who sold out  To have done one s best work in youth is proof that one has lived downward rather than upward Long is the roll of artists who beginnng with more genius than character shuffle off their glory like a rich garment and sink down in rags or broadcloth to a sordid feast Indeed so often does the world watch this spectacle that the early death of the inspired one seems the only sure consecration   Aere Perennius  There is only one code of honor for an artist to be true to his vision Bryant preferred to lead a comfortable life and be a good journalist rather than a poet and so he descended from the serene nobility of the Thanatopsis to the puerile pieties of the Hymn to the Sea The Future Life The Crowded Street and many other truly orthodox utterances Even The Forest Hymn perhaps the best of these says merely the proper and expected thing offering bland counsels of moderation  But let me often to these solitudes  Retire and in Thy presence reassure  My feeble virtue Here its enemies  The passions at Thy plainer footsteps shrink  And tremble and are still  If the passions were indeed the enemies of this poet s feeble virtue they never got the upper hand At least they do not appear in his poetry It is said that Mr Bryan pronounces To a Waterfowl the finest American poem a a preference which marks the limitation of his reading or taste but this which is no doubt Bryant s best lyric is also marred by the ever present and expedient moral The famous Truth crushed to earth quatrain from The Battlefield is the only bit of his poetry after the Thanatopsis in which his religiosity rises for a moment to higher ground and assumes something of prophetic dignity  Bryant was in short a man born to be a poet who sacrificed the muse not to those violent enemies the flesh and the devil but to that more insidious one the world or in other words comfort and respectability Now and then a brief   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  flash of inspiration disturbed his placidity but gradually the light went out until in his tone imparting old age he could not even see that he was sitting in darkness  Let us be careful whom we honor with monuments Build one to Poe who was true to his art whether drunk or sober to Whitman who never sold out even to pay his debts to Whistler whom neither wrath nor ridicule could swerve from his purpose to any starveling who keeps faith with the muse and scorns a respectable old age but not to the deserter the wearer of ribbons the tone imparter  H M  PAUL CLAUDEL  Paul Claudel is a difficult author who has written three or four books that are easy to read and yet although these are less arduous of approach than the rest of his work properly to understand them as with the other books requires calm leisure and meditation Georges Duhamel I think in order to write his essay in the Mercure de France retired into the country so that he might be alone with his author and undisturbed Jacques Riviere s two studies in Études bear all the marks of a lonely meditation and after this statement at the end of the first  Et maintenant il faut recourir au silence il faut tout oblier de cette analyse simplement destinée à faciliter la lecture Voici que dans le secret l uvre de Claudel se reforme se rassemble se condense et nous apparaît soudain dans sa terrible beauté   Paul Claudel  he finishes with a prayer to such a point of spiritual freedom had his study brought him  If there are two things that are super eminent in the work of Claudel they are imagination and religion the imagination being of that kind which sets up innumerable bridges of metaphor between man and the sensible universe the religion Catholic in form but combined with the imagination infinite in its extensions If you conceive a man profoundly devoted to the Catholic Church whose mind is like a torch moving in the metaphysic darkness of the world whose five senses are ever alert and quick in their responses to the radiations that impinge upon them whose memory is an infallible storehouse of rich sensation you have some idea of a poet who is only obscure when his conceptions are greater than human expression and who is bright with the clarity of fresh and pristine emotions when he is rendering what you and I might also see and perhaps feel Taking this passage for instance from Le Cocotier in Connaissance de l Est  La nuit revenant le long de la plage battu avec une écume formidable par la masse tonitruante de ce léonin Océan Indien que la mousson du sud ouest pousse en avant comme je suivais cette rive jonchée de palmes pareilles à des squelettes de barques et d animaux je voyais à ma gauche marchant par cette forêt vide sous un opaque plafond comme d énormes araignées grimper obliquement contre le ciel crépusculaire Vénus telle qu une lune toute trempée de plus purs rayons faisait un grand reflet sur les eaux Et un cocotier se penchant sur la mer et l étoile comme un être accablé d amour faisait le geste d approcher son c ur du feu céleste  O r this again from Le Promeneur in the same book   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Aux heures vulgaires nous nous servons des choses pour un usage oubliant ceci de pur qu elles soient mais quand après un long travail au travers des branches et des ronces à Midi pénétrant historiquement au sein de la clairière je pose ma main sur la croupe brûlante du lourd rocher l entrée d Alexandre à Jerusalem est comparable à l énormité de ma constatation  You see that in the first passage you have a perfect image complete in poetic detail but in the second you have this and something more you have the sudden shock of a mind that has the faculty of absolute virgin experience behind which too is knowledge of things worn and obliterated by use so that out of the torpor of the one state and because of it comes because of that faculty of poetic readjustment and vision the enormous sensation of the world seen for the first time  The bulk of Claudel s work is dramatic in form Four volumes of his Theatre have been published by the Mercure de France and another by the Nouvelle Revue Française two publishers who divide his other works as well In addition to this dramatic work there are Cinq Grandes Odes suivies d un Processional pour saluer le siècle nouveau Deux Poèmes d Eté containing La Cantate à Trois Voix and Protée drame satyrique odes and hymns that have so far appeared only in reviews translations from Poe Chesterton and Coventry Patmore and an Art Poétique wherein Claudel treats of his conception his representation of life Connaissance de l Est already mentioned is a collection of short essays or poems in a prose of extraordinarily lucid imagery and of singular metaphorical richness recording   Paul Claudel  Claudel s impressions of the East where he was for many years a French consul  This book could serve as an introduction to his work to be followed by L Otage a drama of the French Revolution though this is not stated L Echange a play of which the scene is laid on the eastern shore of America L Annonce faite à Marie mystère which takes place in a Moyen Age de Convention and which can be compared with its first version La Jeune Fille Violaine So far no difficulty the plays are clear with passages of great beauty a verbal magnificence and a poignancy of human drama in them in two L Otage and L Annonce such a sense of French traditions as reveals to men the principles they have been groping for these two the only plays immediately presentable on the stage L Annonce indeed was produced in Paris in December 1912 and was received with great enthusiasm by those critics whose opinion matters eventually and even by the others André du Fresnois the critic of La Revue Critique a royalist organ he has since disappeared engulfed by the war said of it that it is wholly steeped in poetry wholly animated by faith but also wholly sustained by a just notion of the realities of the earth It has sprung incomparably fresh and young from a secular tradition and from the very deeps of French Catholic consciousness It is sublime and familiar popular and mystical L Otage has been produced by the Theatre du Vieux Colombier It is impossible to say more here of these plays or of La Ville Tête d Or and Le Repos du Septième Jour These last with the Odes the Cantate and   the Art Poétique will only be tackled by the earnest student Much good is said of Partage de Midi but it is unobtainable Protée in Deux Poèmes d Été is a délassement de poète and very diverting  Claudel in his dramas owes much perhaps to Shakespeare and AEschylus for the form of his verse he is apparently indebtedly to Whitman He has himself defined this form in the words given to C uvre La Ville  O mon fils lorsque j étais un poète entre les hommes J inventais ce vers qui n avait ni rime ni mètre Et je le définissais dans le secret de mon c ur cette fonction  double et réciproque Par laquelle l homme absorbe la vie et restitue dans l acte suprême de l expiration Une parole intelligible  And again in the Odes  O mon âme impatiente pareille à l aigle sans art comment ferions nous pour ajuster aucun vers à l aigle qui ne sait pas faire son nid même  Que mon vers ne soit rien d esclave mais tel que l aigle marin qui s est jeté sur un grand poisson Et l on ne voit rien qu un éclatant tourbillon d ailes et l éclaboussement de l écume Mais vous ne m abandonnerez point O Muses modératrices  In the Art Poétique he has also said that his art is based on la métaphore le mot nouveau l opération qui résulte de la seule  existence conjointe et simultanée de deux choses différentes  And the whole of his work is upheld by the intensity of his visual imagination constantly creating new metaphors that have the power of primitive sensations F S Flint   REVIEWS  Visions and Revisions by John Cowper Powys G Arnold  Shaw New York  This book of literary devotions though by an admirer of the grand style is wilfully formless detached ragged a kind of crazy quilt in which bits of old brocade or rich modern gros grain are inextricably mixed up with calico in an empirical arrangement innocent of pattern or law Its various essays read like stenographic reports of Mr Powys talks but whereas on the lecture platform the talk is unified and harmonized by the magnetic personality of the speaker in cold print it becomes exclamatory and falls apart for lack of style It needs shaping and carving planning for the whole scheme with its dues of balance emphasis and climax  It is a pity because Mr Powys shows not only intelligent appreciation of his favorite masters but the rarer quality of imaginative sympathy Milton the incarnation of the Nietzschean ideal less of a Christian than any European writer since the Gospel appeared Shelley s icecold austerity of mind necessary if one has to detach oneself entirely from the idols of the market place Whitman who holds open by main gigantic force that door of hope which Fate and God and Man and the Laws of Nature are all endeavoring to close Nietzsche whose spiritual contest was the deliberate self inflicted crucifixion of the Christ in him as an offering to the Apollo in him Shakespeare s aching rhythms Shakespeare of the melancholy skepticism   with its half humorous assent to the traditional pieties in these and other instances he shows a comprehension born of love  These papers are fragmentary studies of aspects and temperaments They scorn to be constructive or exhaustive or in any sense complete but they are personal and sincere and now and then they shake out rainbow lights offer hints of glory Our concern at present is with the nine poets among the author s nineteen literary heroes among these he is most incisive with Shakespeare Shelley perhaps Whitman and most obvious with Keats and Arnold But the whole book is a rhapsody of praise for the grand style of which he says It announces and commands it weeps and it pleads it utters oracles and wrestles with angels It never apologizes it never rationalizes and it never explains H M Earth Deities and Other Rhythmic Masques by Bliss Car  man and Mary Perry King Kennerley  I own to lack of interest in this kind of artificial and fanciful little out door plays and to a wonder whether our poets can not give a more significant and modern answer to the many out door clubs through the country who wish to present sylvan plays in the woods The Bohemian Club of San Francisco perhaps set the fashion during the nineties and many other clubs have followed it but as yet so far as I am aware nothing has been done which will endure beyond the day s entertainment  Recently I was one of the judges in a competition for two prizes of one hundred dollars and of fifty dollars offered   Reviews  for such plays by the Friends of Our Native Landscape a Chicago out door club Such an offer of prizes is an urgent call to American poets showing a real need Yet nearly all the plays sent in were like the masques in this book a highly attenuated working over of classic myths And the prizes went faute de mieux to masques of this character though the first prize poet at least preserved a modern diction  Is there no one who can put some life into this kind of thing Can we not have a vital and beautiful response to a vital and beautiful demand H M King Fu Tze a Dramatic Poem by Paul Carus Open  Court Publishing Co Chicago and London  Dr Carus backed by the Open Court Publishing Company and its quarterly magazine The Monist now edited by Mr Edward C Hegeler has for many years devoted his rare intelligence to the search for the higher truth the contemplation of the higher spiritual life K ung Fu Tze which is a dramatic presentation of the Confucian ideal and such poems as The Overgod in the current Monist are to be regarded not as poetry so much as a metrical paraphrase of certain philosophic ideas The high serenity of the man speaks through them and they present a contemplative spirit s understanding of the riddle of the universe H M The Winnowing Fan Poems on the Great War by Law  rence Binyon The New Poetry Series Houghton  Mifflin Co  Mr Binyon s war poetry is the work of a writer whose every instinct is for prose and whose phrasing when in   desperate search for a rhyme is sometimes piteous in its agonized appeal for mercy How is it that a man whose studies of oriental art show a certain discrimination can perpetrate such a quatrain as the following  And there upon the pavement stretched The German wounded groan To see the dropping flames of death And feel the shells their own And the long Ode for September while full of amiable sentiments never lapses into poetry In fact only twice or thrice in the course of the books are we surprised by a few good lines Perhaps the best instance is this quatrain in To the Belgians  Still for your frontier stands The host that knew no dread Your little stubborn land s Nameless immortal dead  H M CORRESPONDENCE  TWO NOTES ON GERMAN POETRY  Editor of Poetry The following facts concerning German art seem to demand repetition in connection with Reginald H Wilenski s interesting articles on German poetry in two winter numbers of your magazine  On page 178 Mr Wilenski makes this statement German culture is the exclusive possession of a small class   Of all nations Germany registers the lowest percentage of illiteracy and the amazing quantity and quality of German publications of all kinds fully confirms this fact  A first class literary or art journal cannot flourish without adequate public support It follows inevitably from the beauty number and size of German literary and artistic publications that the class which supports them is not relatively small From an artistic point of view our American publishing world would be a barren desert were it not for European and particularly German importations Our spiritual hunger cannot feed on business baseball or gasoline And every serious American or English magazine that attempts to free itself for the sake of truth and beauty has a hard time of it  Again on page 179 German savants have absolutely no humor  Humor is not the chief asset of a savant anywhere Does Mr Wilenski expect the great and venerable Ernst Haeckel to crack jokes about Darwin and evolution For true German humor let us turn to Beethoven s eighth symphony to the beloved Jean Paul to Hugo Wolff s songs to Ernst von Wolzogen Fritz Reuter Wilhelm Busch or to the world famous Jugend Simplississimus and Fiegende Blaetter  Since the days of the Gothic Germany s painting has been negligible and the modern revival has produced singularly uninspired results  This is truly staggering Modern German art is notable for its universal appeal The curious restless life devouring   and life creating mind of modern man clothing primitive passions with undreamt of refinements has found in Germany masterly interpreters  On page 180 A poet would be inevitably influenced by this German military environment and Poor ailing creatures with pale fingers and sunken cheeks  Was Keats influenced by the Napoleonic Wars Was Francis Thompson influenced by the London slums Were Leconte de Lisle or Carducci influenced by Christian civilization Were Whitman Poe Lanier influenced by Yankee opinions No No poet great or small is necessarily influenced by his environment A great poet makes his environment he would rather die in the attempt like John Davidson than allow the environment to make him No one will ever understand poets or poetry who does not understand this Environment may furnish him material and occasions but not the inspiration that comes from within always Modern German poets who like Hugo von Hoffmansthal and Hauptmann belong to that select company who really enlarge the soul s horizons are by no means obsessed by militarism Even Liliencron does not always sing of soldiers Why not quote his sunny and dithyrambic Ich war so gluchlich or his charming Ideal Sparziergang  Since Swinburne s Songs before Sunrise are still in the dark we need other torch bearers who like Arturo Giovannitti are able with genius to carry on the flame and one of these is undoubtedly Richard Dehmel Dehmel has not as Mr Wilenski states stuck to tradition He is a   socialist poet and fortunately he dares to say things which certain unctuous persons find regrettable a word by the way which is almost as threadbare as the well worn suggestive His V erwandlungen der Venus is the work of a true poet The fact that some librarians hide it is almost evidence enough  To characterize German poets as ailing pale with sunken cheeks is ludicrous Otto Julius Bierbaum Hartleben Herman Bahr Liliencron etc those robust vikings ailing It would make a sturdy Teuton roar with laughter Also Liliencron undoubtedly would have resented the ecclesiastical title of high priest He was noted for his simple warm humanity  Finally let me suggest that the dreadnoughts of England and the howitzers of Germany have nothing to do with poetry The greatest events of to day are merely a running accompaniment to that immortal melody which surges forever through the universe How many critics know it when they hear it Ernest W Nelson  The following letter comes from one of the assistant professors of German in Vassar College  Dear Editor I have been reading the articles on German poetry in your winter numbers Having been for a number of years a student of contemporary German poetry I have been impressed over and over by the beauty of it by the many new themes and forms It seems to me that the writer of the article can not possibly have read this poetry widely   or in any sense without prejudice The Kondor is I think an interesting collection its poets some of whom I have met are earnest in purpose and although I dislike the crassness and café atmosphere I find beautiful as well as interesting things in the book  Mr Wilenski also says that Heine is the first lyricist since Walther von der Vogelweide Heine s was a narrow and cynical lute compared with Goethe s surely and I can not understand how anyone could fail to recognize Goethe s broad unmelancholy genius  Also it may interest you to know à propos of your note on universities and contemporary poetry that at the University of Munich for instance one professor lectures on contemporary German poetry and has evenings once a week in connection with these courses at which contemporary poets read to the students from their works At this University another professor lectures on art since Cézanne with slides illustrating all kinds of futurists and cubists and he holds seminars in the secessionist and post secessionist exhibits It was a great inspiration to me to come in touch with these interesting activities there last summer  Louise Kueffner  Notes  NOTES  Mr Padraic Colum the Irish poet who is now lecturing in this country

genius among us we don t want to make him behave just like ourselves we shall enjoy him best and learn most from him if he remains himself So we think Mr Pound has chosen the right method in these translations and we do not mind that they often are not English The words are English and give us the sense and after all it is the business of a writer to mould language to new purposes not to say something new just as his forefathers said something old So it is the business of the reader not to be angry or surprised at a strange use of language if it is a use proper to the sense  Chinese poetry has a wonderful humanity like Chinese painting and it is very free from artistic nonsense The Chinese poet at least in the great age of Tang did not sit down to write poetry and lose his common sense in the process He wrote to say something that was worth saying and even in translation he interests us like a man of experience talking seriously and without parade  Mr Pound has kept the
