their lips as they sneered With death laughter upon them Light poured in silver Off their arched necks But there was blood upon their flanks Scarlet trickling upon the white sinews The stallions were prancing to death Trumpeting defiance with their nostrils  White Chillingham bulls followed them I saw them gore the stallions But a wince of pain was across their eyes too Sharp horse hoofs had struck them on the heart   They fought with missing heart beats To plow on tearing the soil with polished hoofs  If they could only reach the forest If only to die there I could not help them  I remembered dreams I had had In which white mastodons trampled the plains Seeking to reach the forest before death And white Irish stags ten men high With antlers that were giant trees with white bar Had stumbled under the weight of their own bulk A wince was across all their eyes But a smile a never mind tenderness Perhaps they were sure of coming into the purity Because of their whiteness  I knew why they were white They were my dreams all frozen And all white with the frost upon them And white with the frost all through them They were frozen thwarted male things Rushing somewhere Seeking fighting and killing But white say that of them The steam off their quivering flanks Sweated and weak with exhaustion was white They would never find mates   Robert McAlmon  Before they died There would be no more white males None so clear a white as these Only some tinged with gray dusty But I could not watch them rush to the forest forever Not one did I see arrive there A cloud or night or blackness always intervened I saw them rush forward and disappear And then saw no more of them  TODAY S MUSIC  His being started with decision  Quick as a pair of highstrung horses given the rein  When the orchestra s music danced With his impalpable sensual images  It was wine steam to drunken him Heavy rhythmic plucked gold petals of music Floating with sonorous etherealism about him  He could not wait when it had ceased More could be heard on other nights Out to walk with his head amongst the stars With the sky standing straight before him He went breathing the poignant night drugged Knowing the moon was a diadem for his head And the slow sensuous ecstasies Of music that his mind could not quite catch Only he was living music    Many times he had thought how sufficient life would be Could a man dance the motion he feels And sing the songs within him But when your limbs fail you When your voice will not ascend But tonight he would make music Music that was virile and barbarous  He could see electric threads of clipped blue Dancing from positive to negative electric poles In music He could hear color movement and noises He could see music that pictured the flow of generations Into life impetuous rushing gleaming with flesh and sun  light and darkness The shriek of maddened prehistoric brutes was in his ears They were waging battle to death wading in blood Fighting for the preservation of their species Deep in the tangled forest The dissonances of many insects rasping shrilly The silence for moments of murderous insect warfare He could hear music that was a history of sound Since the world began the lighted city streets ran ahead of him Like slender gold lizards basking in the moonlight So many years the moon too well known Had irked him for being no exotic moon  tonight he would compose music   Free music for the soul the intellect Not honey in the listener s ear The dolorous drip of harps The sob of bass violins Catgut moaning mindless sorrow He would write music something of sweetness too The pipes of goat herds on Athenian hills Slim girls chanting for religious ceremonies And dancing love in their limbs where worship should be The clash of knights armor in tournament All coming to the climax of subways clamoring in tunnels  And other sounds Far away train whistles fog s horn on the bay Aliens singing their native songs Hunched in drab haunts of a metropolis Chinese discordant falsetto babblings Pale yellow notes descending in eighth tones He would write music there would be no more lone  liness Of the soul for him He would reach back through the ages Reach forth to the future for companions of his spirit And his music would touch them as with understanding  hands He was through with themes and composition Only kaleidoscopic resoundings playing upon the nerves Awakening the instinct memory of people With their jeering gentle maniacal forgiving heterogeneity   Negroes would run quick blood in their hearts As progenitors in Africa had run centuries ago Savages in a religious dance shrieking fear At some demon s wrath because storm and lightning Has broken in upon their ceremonies The bellowing of a rhinoceros bull as he rushed To gore the huntsman whose arrow had wounded him The trumpet of elephant herds stampeding panic stricken Through the forest tearing aside small trees as they rush The rumble of bison hoofs beating endlessly over plains With Indians whooping in pursuit of them  He would write music such that one would hear The rush of the stream of life Music of evolution The sibilant hiss of snakes fading into The flap of reptilian bird wings The satin swish of sea species leaving the waters To go forth upon the land prospering as land beast Or going toward extinction music just the same Washed scarlet tones high persistent and dissonant He needed such music for the rhythm of his blood Such music for the vehement dance restrained within  him A mad wild dance limbs breaking bones cracking A dance hurtling the sky a life dance  He would make music yes such such music He intended to make music   And he turned at the corner near his boarding house The same cats were making love in the same way As they had made love for the three dull months of summer The same pastry shop stood in front of him  the same dark room the same gas light in its grayness Awaited him He would make music music of tedium  too Yes tomorrow music tonight He needed coffee and doughnuts to sleep well And then such music tomorrow   FORM DESTRUCTIONIST SCULPTOR  Many moods apathy tagged to the end of most Had gone into the carving of his masterpiece Lady with a three cornered smile He groveled when a critic spoke of his Ironical incision and sensitive cognition of inner essence God he could not so facilely Plumb for himself the dolorous enigma of his art Her obese countenance Proclaimed his contempt for most of mankind At their best making an art of adaptation And at their worst Words signify nothing when silence is permissible  Three times he had destroyed beginnings of his last work Fearing that they were not authentic expressions   Of impulses indigenous of his own contacts  Given the alien substance of some trifling annoyance His nature could furnish nacre For finer pearls of concept and of execution than these  Some things of his completed Minor things not a discredit to him but He shrugged an intellectual shoulder inwardly When they were praised Certainly he knew He d caught the tigerish amative spirit Of the over pure in his Satyre Religieux But its blazing orbs lecherous with lust light Treacherously savage with repression Were too flamboyant a repetition of satire well done before The plastic suavity of his Enigmatic Nun With a smile of invitation upon her saintly lips Gratified his sense of attainment but slightly  Realism and truth be damned he was often heard to say They are trite insistences What is the realism of a plasmic germ Whose species we do not know Creation is the only reality Phantasmagorical statues almost emerged From the gray draperies of his subconsciousness At moments of such proclamation Everything in the universe swirled Or went through his mind in fluid conceptions   There is no infinite only our questions Which are unreal until we answer them definitely Only space which our minds do not fill with forms But it is not of the ego it does not exist I am my universe What I know exists What I do not know is not He would say to his reflection in the mirror And it did not disconcert him with a refutation Whereupon impulses that were themselves masterpieces Arose from the dormancy of his will He planned to put them into marble Eternity is the metabolic process of the universal germ The universe is an organism Species the corpuscles in its blood its veins My intellect is the skeleton of my universe He told portraits upon the wall of his room They acquiesced Some day through the sweep of his imagination He would come upon form transcended Beyond the limitation of line and contour  Meanwhile He worked on lesser things recalling The tiny spotted fawn he had found in the woods A hunter must have killed its mother For hunger had robbed it of instinctive terror An inquisitive baby snout had sought his face As he carried it in his arms Moist nose little hungry tongue licking   Luminous trustful eyes Tenderly he recalled the tiny thing Which of course died too young to eat as he could feed it So beautiful so sweetly pathetic an impulse Was in him He put it into marble in the form of an oval With dim lines to subtly suggest many possibilities New life love destruction He would always disdain visual reproduction  Tiny lizards antelope like in grace That he had watched for days out on the desert Certainly could not be caught in cold hard stone By showing them in any fixed postures Their alert listening bodies when they stopped In running through lavender sage weed He had memorized in marble By slender oblongs that bent upward in a quick angle  Only because the unique shape of sea horses Fascinated him had he copied their likeness Twining two stallion necked worm headed beasts With watch spring bodies together he felt gratified Believing he had them as they made love In the marine garden s tank Yet he was not sure that his tapering based Interrogation marks did not please his sense Of the thing to be done with them in art the more   Robert McAlmon  And for these things to be called A symbolistic ironist He shuddered He trifling with that ephemeral quality irony Doing a burlesque of the things that change I have no religion but self Nothing I worship but my art He told his quivering sensibilities to soothe them He knew there was lion passion in him As well as lamb softness He would run the gamut of experience Then compress a year s living into a gesture a line So that his passion of resistance His thwarted longings amidst loneliness His cleansing of soiled actualities Had permanent expression in symbols Sufficiently withdrawn not to be subjected To the misinterpretations of the multitude  Music that sent him forth T o walk across Brooklyn Bridge His heart caught between the pricks Of pointed melodies His breast cold in the salt wind His wrists singing with the pain of being This music Flutes cold water ringing on thin glass Sombre violins droning bee tragedies He would hold these tonalities into being   For a longer time than it takes silence to seep them in He would put music into white marble Marble that sang And dancers and colors These he would transform to marble too White marble abstract of form But sensitive intuitions would recognize The color the motion in them Attuned ears would hear the music Of his white marble Gray green violet magenta orange blue yellow Moss melody movement Caught in white marble Caught in the whiteness of abstraction Worshipful beauty for spiritual intimacies  But this morning he could not speak to himself in the mirror Morning was a pathologic time of Time for him From his window he saw that hills were green But he did not care to explore their greenness After all green is a slavery Green trees then red yellow white Spring summer autumn winter And after some years Other trees come into the slavery of the same routine  As for his sculpturing Well enough   But what of his living Between sunrise and sunrise any life is held pendulating What if a few stars are stitched In the hem of the garment one cannot throw off The sky one cannot look far into What of his living just to live Life swirled past him in a flowing stream Ebb the tide flow the current Wind of Time The only thing existing the things in his mind And it a mind wild for freedom Wind gust were dry leaves crackling Dust on his windowpanes  He washed his teeth and combed his hair He tied a colored cravat in a freshly linened collar In the mirror his face was a morbid picture Rather appealing perhaps Sullen with youth grave with despondence But there was breakfast to have The day was never his without his coffee So he thought of coffee In his mind the universe thinking Alone of coffee sieved his self perceptions Coffee with not too much cream and sugar  Robert McAlmon   POETRY A Magazine of V erse  TWO POEMS  MRS FREUDENTHAL CONSULTS THE WITCH OF ENDOR  A nose however aquiline Escapes detection in a throng So she hopes but sense of sin Made her shrink and steal along  Streets glazed by mocking summer heat To semblance of a cool canal Where iridescent insects beat Their wings upon the liquid wall  Where radiant insects carrion fed Buzz and flutter busily Smile or frown or nod the head Expressing some familiar lie  Enter the house ascend the stair Consult the scintillating ball Beatrice Freudenthal beware Eve felt like you before the Fall  Within the shining mystic globe Lies luck at bridge or martyr s crown  A modern prophetess will probe The future for one guinea down   Osbert Sitwell  For that amount the future s sword From crystal scabbard she will drag She can unpack the future s hoard As we unpack a Gladstone bag  Without the agency of man Solely by fasting and by prayer The wizards of old Jenghiz Khan Could move a wine cup through the air  Until it reached him and he drank Fermented juice of rye or grape The cup flew back his courtiers shrank Away astonished and agape  Before the Llama turns to grapple With state affairs he learns to spin Despite Sir Isaac Newton s apple In mid air sixty times to win  Amusement mixed with approbation From skeptical ambassadors For any kind of levitation Increases prestige with the Powers  Such things were practised did not tend To promote war or anarchy   Yet now such things would even end A Constitutional Monarchy  Magic for a holy race Is surely wrong how strictly hidden The future in its crystal case Lies oh so near and yet forbidden  Though gentile kings upon their thrones May weave a spell or dance like Tich Yet ponder on the bleaching bones Of Saul who sought the Endor witch  DEAD MAN S WOOD  In Dead Man s Wood The rustling trees Shiver shudder In the breeze  The bird song drips On Dead Man s Wood Trickles through Like falling blood  And if the sun Gives forth its light   The yellow glory Turns ash white  The dark tall trees When day is past Draw back their leaves Pale and aghast  When rusty shadows Fall at dusk Surely the spirit Leaves its husk  All night all day Within this cover I sit and wait For my dead lover  Osbert Sitivell   UNION  I  Suppose me dead think of the man you made A moment but as earth unbreathing more His garments folded and his reckoning paid Of love and faith and fame then as before A chronicle all done with finis writ Ask if the man you made had truly been More worth your pride and daily watching wit Had fear of you one passage cancelled clean  Would you not say serenely gospelled then I taught him faith I bade his word be said Fearing no challenge nor reproof of men And had the happy courage that I bred Once brought me chill obedience for wage This chronicle had been a poorer page  II  For dear I can but serve you at the rate That is my heart s occasion that is all If I deny myself and with you wait It is not I however you may call Something of me must go if I deny Though in denial shall be with you still   John Drinkwater  A body walking and a watchful eye  The patient service of an impoverished will  For if the love that loved and chose and came Ever again to you nor ever found Estrangement in far absences nor blame For pilgrimage to other Edens bound Should know one beauty by your will denied Thenceforth how should old faith be satisfied  III  But when you bid me go as beauty calls Knowing that my desire could follow none But fair vocation and that intervals In honest love are still love s errands done When you upon my embarkation wait And cry O keel Forth in pursuit of spring All archipelagos to navigate You are my ship and this your voyaging  Then nothing lets between your sovran pride And all my kingdom nor is poor pretence That over all my fortunes you preside When half my levies are rebellious pence Then do you govern that your craft began A man and not the shadow of a man  John Drinkwater   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  HELLENICS  BLUE SLEEP  Aphrodite Aphrodite of the blue sleep the bird black sea I thank you that at last my body is at peace  I toss these flowers from the flowers your feet From the pearbuds of your ankles The white hyacinths of your limbs  The love hour is ended Swallow wings dreams of a spiked iris Gipsy your eyes  The hollows under your knees are sweet with love Your knees are quince blossoms bent back by the rain  Blue of your eyes  Blue of the Greek seas that has no name Am I lifted To the porch of Aphrodite on your wings  EOS  Your face is the flush of Eos  You are dawn  Your face is Greece   W Bryher  Under your lifted arm  There is lavender to kiss  Sea lavender spiced with salt  Before the fierce cyclamen wine has burnt my lips  I kiss your limbs wild followers of Artemis  Your eyes break sleep  I touch the pansy set below your heart  Each kiss a star  That fades upon your body which is dawn  April scent of your throat  O spiced flowers of your shoulders  Will you shrink from the lion my heart  WILD ROSE  O wild rose bend above my face  There is no world Only the beat of your throat against my eyes  White moss is harsh Against these soft white petals of your feet It is hard to dream you have followed the wild goats Aslant the perilous hills  I have only the fire of my heart to offer you O peach red lily of my love  W Bryher   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE WORKER  I ve towered above the hilt of my spade Knowing with what muscle gnawing action I mold the earth into usable shape And there rises within me what is more pain to stay But the desert is answerless  The desert is blue and yellow and answerless  I ve risen above the hairy smell of me I ve held down my rigored fists I ve stood high over shoulders To the mind of me But the mind s unresponsive as lead And the lips are sealed as with lead  As a leaden bell with a song it must sing  I ve faced men with God in their faces I ve shown them the crucifixion in mine From a breast not yet washed of oil and mud of labor I ve loosed my blood on foreign lands for men And I ve cried aloud But it was not the cry of battle pain Now the people wave flags in drunken triumph And smother my only song in street dust and confetti  With my spade I ve changed the desert With the fire of me I ve melted the lead   David Greenhood  But men  Even Christ could not make you listen  THANKS FOR A SEASON  My thanks to Thee are rhythmed air Ring out bell sea  The meadow lark feels the swing of morning Chortles a carol of coming day The milkman tinkles down a stony street The merchant click a clacks past a row of stores And opens his own with a click a click of keys A huckster s wagon fresh with country scents Wheezes along the reveller s hack Whirs down the avenue toward the dark in the west Whence come cathedral chimes At town s end the sun bends in afresh Makes roadside pools iridescent with dawn A new pale sweet now blows over gutter ways And eastern walls of jail turn mellow pink And numbed hills delight in opening poppies I think this day Lord these be my prayer  David Greenhood   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  LISTENER  I ve been with old men  Shadowy and slow  Men dead and buried  A long while ago  But the songs that they sang me  Grave songs and sweet  Held me the whole day  Stretched at their feet  Fire danced and water  Whirled to the tune  Laughter went ringing  Down the long noon  But oh what I loved most  Was not song at all  Not the rich cadence  The silvery fall  Of passionless voices  Kept me in thrall  But the unquenched ardor  Pitying wise  That lit their frail features  And flamed in their eyes  With a flame that transfigured  Starlight and dew  The deep peace of old men  When singing is through  Bernard Raymund   MOCKERY  Happened that the moon was up before I went to bed Poking through the bramble trees her round gold head I didn t stop for stocking I didn t stop for shoe But went running out to meet her oh the night was blue  Barefoot down the hill road dust beneath my toes Barefoot in the pasture smelling sweet of fern and rose Oh night was running with me Tame folk were all in bed And the moon was just showing her wild gold head  But before I reached the hilltop where the bramble trees are  tall I looked to see my lady moon she wasn t there at all Not sitting on the hilltop Nor slipping through the air Nor hanging in the brambles by her bright gold hair  I walked slowly down the pasture and slowly up the hill Wondering and wondering and very very still I wouldn t look behind me I went at once to bed And poking through the window was her bold gold head  Katharine Riggs   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  TWO SONGS OF ADVENT  I  On the desert between pale mountains our cries Far whispers creeping through an ancient shell  Coyote on delicate mocking feet Hovers down the canyon among the mountains His voice running wild in the wind s valleys  Listen listen for I enter now your thought  HAWK S EYES  As a gray hawk s eyes  Turn here and away  So my course turns  Where I walk each day  THE FAR VOICE  Roads lie in dust  White curling far away  And summer comes   Yvor Winters  THE WALKER  A leaf turns The mind burns  Thin and clear Death stands here  His lips bend For Time s end  Over all My feet fall  BALLAD  I sat alone  Lest thought might fail Down the fine road of day  I sat atone  The swinging flail Of men will never stay  I sat alone  A blade of grass was pale Like a woman far away   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE IMMOBILE WIND  Blue waves within the stone Turn like deft wrists interweaving  Emotion undulant alone Curled wings flow beyond perceiving  Swift points of sight mystic and amorous little hands The wind has drunk as water swallows sifting sands  The wings of a butterfly Feel of the wind Tentatively as men die In thought that have not  SONG FOR A SMALL BOY WHO  Sweeter than rough hair  On earth there is none  Rough as the wind  And brown as the sun  I toss high my short arms  Brown as the sun  I creep on the mountains  And never am done   sinned  HERDS GOATS  Yvor Winters  Sharp hoofed hard eyed Trample on the sun Sharp ears stiff as wind Point the way to run  Who on the brown earth Knows himself one Life is in lichens That sleep as they run  BALLAD OF MEN  Like long clouds On the sky line All day men come to me stand and watch them sidewise In thought eternally  And if men pass They pass like birds With necks craning aside  And when they pass I know that You Or they or I have lied  And all my life And all my sight Are scattered like green sea  There is death in women walking Thus I come unto Thee   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  THE PRIESTHOOD  We stand apart  That men may see  The lines about our eyes  We perish we  Who die in art  With that surprise  Of one who speaks  To us and knows  Wherein he lies  WHERE MY SIGHT GOES  Who knows  Where my sight goes  What your sight shows  Where the peachtree blows  The frogs sing  Of everything  And children run  As leaves swing  And many women pass  Dressed in white  As thoughts of noon pass  From sea to sea   Yvor Winters  And all these things would take My life from me  DEATH GOES BEFORE ME  Death goes before me on his hands and knees And we go down among the bending trees  Weeping I go and no man gives me ease I am that strange thing that each strange eye sees  Eyes of the silence and all life an eye Turn in the wind and always I walk by  Too still I go and all things go from me As down far autumn beaches a man runs to the sea  My hands are cold my lips are thin and dumb Stillness is like the beating of a drum  Yvor Winters  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COMMENT  THE CHRISTMAS CLOCK  THE recurrent holiday season chiming like a clock above the voices of the world s unrest may well remind us of laws more ancient than the race of rhythms which reach beyond our little planet Even now in this epoch of upheaval when the world is bubbling down into a new shape after its mighty brew even now we keep step in the procession of life and move on eternal and immutable tides Disorder so visible and audible is merely a surface phenomenon of sputter and spatter of foam and roar from an airplane nearer than a summer cloud we should see it for part of the pattern for the burden of one of time s waves to be cast up at last on that shore at the sky line as ruthlessly as the most violent generation of the past  To consider the beauty of order is almost to adventure upon platitudes yet even that risk may be accepted when the clock strikes through the noise The movement of days of seasons of years the super rhythms of sun and stars to feel these is to hear the fundamental chord on which the music of life is based And the endless procession of life beating its slighter tunes in time to those rhythms varying its measures from the march to the dance rounding the circle from fluttering infancy to trembling age this is a beauty more poignant than love or death the immense beauty which embraces love and death   Why don t we write about it the most poetic thing in the world said a poet the other day a poet still young but past youth s first dazzle and blare The baby emerging like a tiny spark in the dark the child dancing with its little candle youth waving its torch blinded by its own light as it runs men and women loving and laboring fighting and sorrowing bearing the new race passing on the glory the terror then the autumn time of richest color of deepest splendor flaring before it fades and finally the soft whiteness of age shimmering obliterating with death always tempting life always poising its dart uttering its cry and life always beginning again in inexhaustible hope Why aren t we always shouting it singing it making people feel what they so often forget the eternal magnificent rhythm of it  Indeed this message has been from the beginning the underlying meaning of art What other reminder than art do the generations leave as they pass what other reminder of the beauty of life its majestic rhythms and harmonies But for the arts resounding and enduring this earth would possess no records of its past each generation would wither like this autumn s leaves to be trodden out by the next and forgotten as the beast forgets The arts alone can tell the tale of the tribe in carved or masonried stone in color in song The arts alone assert immortality in beauty and say nay to obliterating death They alone give mankind its memories H M   REVIEWS  OTHERS AGAIN  Others for 1919 An Anthology of the New Verse Edited  by Alfred Kreymborg Nicholas L Brown New York  The magazine Others having apparently come to the end of its gay career the present collection is made up from books and other magazines POETRY being responsible for the entries of H L Davis Vachel Lindsay Max Michelson and Wallace Stevens and having published all but four of the twenty six poets represented before ever they became others The general effect of the book is much less radical less experimental than the previous Others anthologies and the material presented is naturally less new than when the magazine was a haven for the wildest orgies of proudspirited youth  Let us take up the entries in their alphabetical anthological order thus one may offer a casual comment on the more recent work of these poets  Conrad Aiken The delicate green and lavender nuances of love the play of unspoken or half spoken passion softly rhyming its way to fulfilment in Conversation Undertones and unfolding a tragedy in Portrait of One Dead Good Aiken these poems brushing our dreams with soft and shadowy words A quiet subtly harmonized étude played in the dark by an artist  Witter Bynner Poor Bynner in my opinion the effort of a conventional mind to express itself unconvention   Others Again  ally achieving merely insincere artificial conceits like the brief Horses or this from Leer  If I might be tall negroes in procession Carrying each of them a rib of you And a cannibal king bearing your collar bone One in my right hand one in my left And touching my forehead with them at slow intervals Might I not be too comforted To weep  Emanuel Carnevali A capricious young poet and lover but sure of both vocations splashing all over the place but somehow making you believe in him in his talent and his feeling saying simple things with a certain freshness and  authority as in these lines  You see all things with newness You see all All but my love  H L Davis A pastoral poet of the great western ranges who feels and makes the reader feel the slow strength of the soil the reluctant passion of sand the patient force of vast fields of grain ripening to the harvest and the power and beauty of men and women standing inevitably in their place doing the work of the world a poet whose rhythms flow massively like deep rivers and whose lines whether of the solid earth itself or of the rare figures moving over it are simplified sculpturesquely and with commanding art into planes and masses A new poet of power one of the most promising of POETRY S prize winners  Jeanne D Orge An airy and mischievous sprite flashing brilliantly in To a Fumbling Lover and still brightly   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  in Defeat and Annabel and splashing in the others Donald Evans Still pursuing his ironies somewhat deliberately and a little less fleet of foot  Robert Frost Mais que fait il dans cette galère and with Mending Wall too However there are too later poems compact and sure as firmly cut and shapely curved as Baptiste s axe helve which one of them celebrates  Arturo Giovannitti Here with The Walker from his book of 1914 a prose poem monologue of prison misery powerful tragic a formidable arraignment its rhythms holding it mostly to the prose side of the border land  Wallace Gould A poet rather in the mass than in detail insisting too loudly on peculiarities of manner a little too self conscious too  serenely proud of having no limitations A poet too assertive no doubt but piling up his images with muscular audacity until one gets a certain cumulative effect as of a natural force at work in some place where it belongs For example one feels the dying New England year in After Tschaikowsky Marsden Hartley Not quite the best work these of this painter poet who can handle words with a certain color subtlety Delicate impressions though whimsical or descriptive Orrick Johns Oriental musings in rhapsodic prose from the author of Country Rhymes one of the finest lyrists of our time Rather a misfit a mere literary exercise   Fenton Johnson The best Negro poet now before the public a man who speaks with authority for his race in beautiful spirituals and other lyrics both in and out of dialect and in such prose poem sketches as these A man whose sincere and finely developed art may reveal to us his people tell us why they are growing tired of building up somebody else s civilization  Throw the children into the river civilization has given us too many It is better to die than it is to grow up and find out that you are colored  Alfred Kreymborg A poet to be taken more seriously than the public seems to think who like the thorough musician he is on the side is pursuing his own individual investigations into both lyric and dramatic rhythms A poet who can say true things with a delightful air of whimsicality and whimsical things with a gay gusto besides now and then sorrowful things that drive to the quick of tears Not quite at his best here but then his best is before the footlights  Vachel Lindsay A new arrival among the Others but so old an arrival in POETRY that he scarcely needs a word from us for these gay Whimseys which we printed a year or more ago and this chanting and stamping Daniel Jazz  Haniel Long A poet often happy in rhyming lyrics but achieving merely prose in this alleged free verse Interesting glimpses though into teacher and student relations  Mina Loy An extreme otherist as innocent of all innocences as of commas periods sentences A knowing one   but we would rather have some other other s eyelashes polish our stars  Max Michelson A true poet a fine artist Offering here delicate but deep searchings into the beauty and mystery of life of the lives of our neighbors so near and yet so aloof And always with a sure touch upon his finely tuned instrument poetic rhythms of accurately responsive beauty These poems make us grieve the more that for the last year or two he has been silent  Marianne Moore Chinese nuts with more shell than meat so said A C H of this formidably clever lady s product years ago when she made her début in POETRY  H D once her college mate in Philadelphia ranks it near the top of the column however and at least we may commend Miss Moore for going her own way  Openly yes With the naturalness Of the hippopotamus or the alligator When it climbs out on the bank to experience the  Sun I do these Things which I do which please No one but myself  Lola Ridge A socialist poet a poet with a message like Giovannitti and perhaps like him even more ardently revolutionist than poet This poem is a fiercely passionate arraignment of the dictators the Late Lords of the Iron  Robert Alden Sanborn A resolute aspirant but the trail of the Muse s garments is hard to find in this rhapsodic description of a prize fight   Others Again  Carl Sandburg Well we have spoken often on this theme this poet has climbed beyond need of a hand from us and is likely to go still higher for all the world to see Autumn Movement proves him once more the master as a lyrist in free verse  William Saphier Again a resolute aspirant observant and descriptive  Evelyn Scott An interesting mind but too pre occupied perhaps to be often responsive to the muse Achieving suggestions descriptive sketches set forth in up to date forms but only now and then a poem as for example Night Music  Marjorie Allen Seiffert Not quite at her best here though these Love Poems in Autumn are impassioned music sounding through grey curtains But Maura is more deeply tragic in its slow and solemn movement while The Old Woman The Portrait of a Woman in Bed and one or two other things in her book may be ranked high in a kind of art extremely rare in this western world though common enough in the Orient a kind which might be called the high grotesque expressing as it does tragic significance through a veritable riot of abundant and beautiful gayety Few artists of our somewhat weary era have sheer animal spirits enough not to speak of humor and deep experience of life to attempt what Mrs Seiffert accomplishes so easily  Wallace Stevens At last a chance to say a word about this reticent poet who refuses to print a book and thereby prove himself the peer of any poet now living and of many   a famous one now dead and enshrined I well remember the amazed delight with which we received his contribution to our war number of November 1914 a new and significant note from a man then unknown and crowded it in although the magazine was already made up And since then his every appearance in our pages has been for us a distinguished honor of which the recent award of the Levinson Prize to his Pecksniffiana is a too slight acknowledgment  One risks banality in any comment on works of art of complete and perfect beauty but the public should be re  minded that no less than that is what Mr Stevens often achieves In verses wild with motion full of din Loudened by cries by clashes quick and sure As the deadly thought of men accomplishing Their curious fates in war he gives us a big man s gorgeous mirrorings of life One  feels in his poems not so much his keen vision his deep intense delight in this curious world his serene scorn of paltriness not so much these things as his exhaustless reserves of them Here is a poet as unapologetically modern and as generous and self content as the Elizabethans were in their day a poet rich and humorous and profound provocative of joy creative of beauty in those who can respond to him His artistic creed confesses certain austerities  The fops of fancy in their poems leave Memorabilia of the mystic spouts Spontaneously watering their gritty soils I am a yeoman as such fellows go I know no magic trees no balmy boughs   Others Again  No silver ruddy gold vermilion fruits But after all I know a tree that bears A semblance to the thing I have in mind It stands gigantic with a certain tip To which all birds come sometime in their time But when they go that tip still tips the tree  If you want the poet s feeling about  This luscious and impeccable fruit of life look with his self searching eyes through Le Monocle de Mon Oncle from which the above extracts are quoted If you want some of his most perfect poems read these few Pecksniffiana and then turn to the whole group in POETRY of October 1919 Such masterpieces of lyric beauty charged in some cases with satiric humor as Fabliau of Florida Peter Parasol and above all The Paltry Nude Starts on a Spring Voyage require no comment If you are captured by them you will go back over the files of POETRY and Others to find the complete works of this poet such splendid poems as Peter Quince at the Clavier Three Travellers Watch a Sunrise or Sunday Morning of which Arthur Ficke said It is either the greatest poem ever written or nothing at all If you are not captured give up Mr Stevens in despair and read Neihardt but your grandchildren to the third and fourth generation will reproach you  William Carlos Williams Excellent Williamsesque studies of flowers Daisy Queenannslace Thistle Great Mullen of which last  One leaves his leaves at home Being a mullen and sends up a lighthouse To peer from   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Dr Williams is like no one else he is himself Only this poet of mixed blood is not quite all of himself for he is always most strenuously and emphatically indeed violently denying the Puritan in him and the Puritan strain is the strongest of all To assert his freedom he must play the devil show himself rioting in purple and turquoise pools of excess I don t mean in these poems but in certain others And unquestionably he riots gracefully whatever didoes he may cut up with words rhythms conventions or morals But he doesn t need to assert his rights we are all quite ready to admit them He is a poet indisputably the brilliant witty dexterous hot blooded Mercutio of the tribe  These are no X Y Z s Here for the present is the end of Others H M  TALL TIMBER AND A LOON  Many Many Moons by Lew Sarett With an introduction  by Carl Sandburg Henry Holt and Co  Why not asked Mr Sandburg in his brief introduction to this book why not have the loam and the lingo the sand and the syllables of North America in the books of North America Therewith he sounds a challenge and expresses as well a deep rooted hunger that hunger for an image of ourselves which is at bottom the most pertinent problem for the American artist to solve How to get on paper or canvas what is most native to us the result of our own experience childhood memories daily contacts Only through this faithfulness to our intimate experience can a national   Tall Timber and a Loon  literature be created since a national literature is a composite of individual expression and not something abstract or arbitrarily concocted by recipe in answer to the demand  In writing of the American Indian Mr Sarett has been true to himself he is writing of himself as it were His contact as forest ranger and guide with the Chippewas has unquestionably changed his outlook on life and I do not think it possible for any imaginative person to come in real contact with the Indians without having his mental vision subtly changed and remoulded When I say the imaginative person I do not of course mean the average Indian agent or missionary who without any imagination of his own can not possibly enter into that of the Indian  There are two ways of expressing what we may call an Indian inspiration One is to use the Indian s own method to get within The other combines with this a more objective view and we have the Indian in a transitional rather than in a primitive stage in which he expresses himself as an Indian because he is an Indian but also as he would try to express himself in terms of the white man s understanding and limitations  Mr Sarett uses both methods His first section Flying Moccasins contains poems for the most part in the first method The section called Chippewa Monologues implies a white man s audience if not actually present at least present in the background of the Indian s consciousness These dramatic character studies have a fine satiric humor and humor by the way is one of the most salient features   of the Indian mind Here we have the Indian on the reservation striving to hold on to his own traditional nobility of behavior and good faith in spite of his keen recognition of the opposite on the part of his aggressive antagonist Particularly trenchant is Little Caribou s council talk in which he comments on the government s attempt to make good farmers of the Indians by giving each an allotment of a hundred and sixty acres of lake and swamp land  For Eenzhun be good farmer Eenzhun should be fish  In the Flying Moccasins section Mr Sarett has attempted an even more difficult thing which is to write Indian poems with the beat of Indian music This is an almost impossible thing to do and I think he has come closer to it in The Blue Duck than any other poet who has attempted it It is extremely difficult for the trained musician to catch the intervals of Indian music both in pitch and time and when the poet tries to catch the accent of Indian song he usually resorts to the expedient of mentioning the accompanying drum beats or gourd rattles or of imitating them by onomatopoeic methods usually not successful Mr Sarett has come closer than the others to achieving the Indian accent in the ictus of his verse itself although he too sometimes reverts to the more imitative and descriptive methods as in the Squaw Dance  Indian symbolism with the image as employed by the Indian is to my mind the most fruitful and translatable contribution that Indian poetry can make to our own Mr   Tall Timber and a Loon  Sarett understands the Indian s concrete natural symbolism and The Blue Duck is a fine example of this sympathetic magic  In the poems in which Mr Sarett speaks in his own proper person there is perhaps more suggestion than actual achievement yet his lyrics have the power of conjuring up arctic nights granite mountains and the lone wolf cry and in them we find the tall timber fresh waters blue ducks and a loon of Mr Sandburg s graphic introduction This is not as Mr Sandburg suggests library poetry it is pioneer poetry with the breath of the wilderness in it and as a transcript of American life it is especially valuable  A C H  THE POETRY OF THE SITWELLS  Argonaut and Juggernaut by Osbert Sitwell Chatto amp  Windus London Alfred A Knopf New York  The People s Palace by Sacheverell Sitwell Basil Black  well Oxford England  Clowns Houses by Edith Sitwell Basil Blackwell  The poetry of these young people has several times been mentioned in the critical portion of this periodical but as the Sitwells one is forced to this unceremonious grouping are about the most vivid literary personalities which emerged in England during the war it may be as well to run through their achievements to date I hope I shall not be considered rude in speaking of these young people the phrase was used in its un Gosse like or complimentary   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  sense For I should think that the first quality an unprejudiced reader would find in their work is youth the energy and vitality and healthy scorn and keen senses of youth They seem to belong to a race which is utterly distinct from the stolid souls who continue to grind out the amiable barrel organ noises euphemistically called Georgian poetry They have nothing in common with what Miss Sitwell amusingly defines as the village idiot school They are distinctly aware of the demise of Queen Victoria and they know that there is a continent of Europe They have visited numerous modern art shows and have taken pleasure in them they do not believe that it is essential to know no language but one s own they do not look at literature  from the Solomon Eagle suburb In fact they do what most English poets of today never dream of doing they live in touch with the intellectual activity of the time I am not praising the intellectual activity of the time but one certainly ought to know it Stravinsky the Russian ballet Proust Joyce Picasso and Braque et hoc genus omne are the expression of our time and are supremely ignored by the dazzling wielders of the English Kultur weapon  All this simply means that the Sitwells are in revolt against that petrifying dullness which makes most English life a kind of projection from the pages of Punch The Sitwells hate good form and the right thing and my country right or wrong and cricket and what nice people do and all the other thousand and one mental barriers erected by a senile generation to make thought and life impossible   The Poetry of the Sitwells  And though I won t pretend that I agree with all their conceptions of poetry I do think that their attitude towards the art is an immense advance on that of most of practically all their compatriots  Let us consider their works more closely Mr Osbert Sitwell has two or three distinct styles The first and most obviously popular is the ironic political satire Here he has achieved individuality It makes no difference whether he signs them with his own name or with a pseudonym or leaves these satires unsigned Anybody who has read one of them can immediately detect his hand in the others as they appear in the Nation and the Herald I don t suggest that they are the last word in lyric poetry but they are very satisfactory as satires even that hobbling rhythm which leaves one uncertain as to whether he is writing prose or vers libre is particularly apt for this conversational irony  Mr Sitwell has not reprinted many of these in book form and they would be rather out of place in a book containing poems designed to produce an effect of beauty but in a separate volume they would be entertaining The book should be called England s Conscience or something of that sort Mr Sitwell s social satire is much lighter than Mr Sassoon s and therefore I think preferable No one else has made such devastating fun of the perplexed muddleheaded English good people Their faculty for doing the dirty with words of peace and love on their lips is a legacy from the good old days when their ancestors spread civilization with the Bible and brandy It is not exactly   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  hypocrisy because they never think enough to be hypocrites it is a heaven sent faculty to enable them to rule the waves Mr Sitwell s little soliloquies expose the process admirably and with scorn but they probably have about as much effect as a neatly flung assagai on a bank of Thames mud There is a whiz a plop the wounded slime gently heaves over and buries the weapon and all is as before  When Mr Osbert Sitwell is attempting to create beauty he is less sure of himself than in satire one can see that he is experimenting carefully and trace a development from the method of a poem like Clavicordi with its pure emotionalism to the fantastic decoration and irony of De Luxe In his more recent poems I seem to trace the effect of that aspect of Laforgue which has been so admirably developed by Mr Eliot I notice this development with great interest since Laforgue strikes me as one of the most dangerous influences one can imagine his style is sometimes very confused and his cynicism is so frequently a mere confession of his sentimentalism I don t think Mr Sitwell can be accused of sentimentalism at least I detect none but I confess some doubts about his style He is certainly more careful now but opening Argonaut and Juggernaut at random I find  Again we sing Enchantment love vague fear and memories That cling about us like the fumes of wine With myriad love enhancing mysteries We pour out in one song intense divine Down the deep moonlit chasms of the waves Our song floats on the opiate breeze   The Poetry of the Sitwells  Ce n est pas ça Mr Sitwell has a far better sense of style when he is juggling with the sentiments of Mrs Freudenthal and Mrs Kinfoot He does get the Laforgue effect and without the sentimentalism  Miss Edith Sitwell s Clowns Houses gives me a most pleasant feeling of bright colors movement and guitar music I have not come across any modern poet not even Miss Lowell who takes so much pleasure in colors or who records color impressions with so much precision She has a painter s sense of words her poems have a sort of primitive art convention which is quite modern and may be likened not too fantastically I hope to the paintings of Mr Gertler or to Edy Legrand s Macao and Cosmage In the twenty nine pages of Clowns Houses I find the following large proportion of color adjectives Colored or colors 9 black 17 white 9 green greenery 8 gold golden 9 red 8 pink 5 yellow 4 blue grey and silver each 3 and gilt gilded tawny orange brown amber vermilion each 1 Frequently these are compound i e air white parrot green proving a conscious desire to convey the precise shade of color visualized In addition Miss Sitwell uses many words which suggest color or at least flash and glitter like fire rainbow metallic sequined The whole effect is bright and invigorating the very opposite of the drab Cotswold kind of poem There is an alert and sensitive mind behind these poems a mind which does perceive the world in its own way Where I do not at all like Miss Sitwell is in her use of simile and metaphor where   she often utterly twists the meaning of words Chattering heat purring greenery instruments that snore like flies all from Minstrels are just the sort of thing Miss Sitwell would detest in a Georgian True she has the merit of being original and true also she is not in the least aiming at a classic effect of sobriety and precision but it is after all the Apollinaire fallacy This may be only a personal crochet no doubt it is but the mixed metaphor and the telescoped metaphor even when used by Mallarmé spoil my enjoyment of a poem Those snoring flies make me think of Milton at his worst  I find Mr Sacheverell Sitwell extremely satisfactory at times He has an exquisite sense of beauty and he can create a mood I like his use of words When he says Silence the cape of Death lies heavy round the bare shoulders of the hills he really does the trick for me It is poetry or rather it is the kind of poetry I most enjoy He has a gift for precise observation and description as for example  The water Lies like a sword With marks of rust Where the sun has caught it  Almost every page has something with that kind of quality in it The Mayor of Murcia is the opus of his book The People s Palace and is probably the most consistently good piece of work in it The passage beginning The whole wide Earth trembles and totters gives an effect of sonority and richness without being rhetorical Mr Sitwell has got to live up to some high hopes of him   The Poetry of the Sitwells  The Wheels anthology published from 1916 19 yearly is edited by Miss Sitwell and contains most of the readable poets who appeared during the war The Wheels people were fortunate in not having to do all the arguing which the Imagists had to do a couple of years earlier nor did they find it necessary to enounce any aesthetic doctrine With these anthologies and with their own books the Sitwells have created a sort of colored oasis in the drab wilderness of English literary squirarchy  Richard Aldington  A PRIZE WINNING POEM  Jehovah by Clement Wood E P Dutton amp Co  In this book the author has set himself a hard problem The poem or series of poems takes for its subject a controversy between the Hebrews and the Kenites in the reign of David The Hebrews represent the conception of Jehovah as a god supporting the strong the religious theory held by ruling classes in all ages while the Kenites are the advocates of a more spiritual conception The researches of modern scholars have been used by the author in building his poem  The difficulties involved in a work of this type are partly technical partly in the theme itself A long poem or series of poems forming an organic whole must have unusual qualities if it is to interest even those who read poetry regularly Perhaps more important the attempt to embody   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  a modern theme in an ancient setting presents serious stylistic and other problems Particularly God is a large subject That in the opinion of some critics Mr Wood was successful in solving his problems is indicated by the award of one of The Lyric prizes for 1919 to this volume  In the opinion of this reviewer the book is only a workmanlike production with some elements of strength and with obvious weaknesses There are effective dramatic passages and pleasant lyric passages Mr Wood being at his best in the latter but the book does not hold the reader  In putting his theme into its Hebraic setting the poet endeavors to weave together the atmosphere spirit and manner of Hebrew times and a modern theme and spirit It is not easy thus to combine the ancient and the modern there is only one James Branch Cabell The two are not woven together in Mr Wood s book They are rather laid side by side with threads overlapping here and there  Some of the songs in the book have the spirit and manner traditionally associated with Jehovah worship and cults contemporaneous with it  His wrath is a hungry lion He has lifted up his spear in anger And slain a thousand of the guardians of Baal  A few pages farther on one comes to other verses full of the psycho analytic content and the characteristic rhythms of sophisticated vers libre  There is one inner room I keep for myself   A tiny room I have locked the door and lost the key You cannot enter Each moment is a step Up an ascending stairway of raptures  There is a long sleep there But beyond the sleep Beyond beyond  The characters moreover are not quite convincing Zadok the priest may actually have had the manners and speech of a shifty grafting political boss but we don t feel him as a reality Even the beautiful vision of Jotham in the last portion of the book where Jehovah is seen as a God of brotherhood and perpetual peace seems Mr Wood s vision much more than Jotham s It is not welded into the structure of the work  A good deal of the reader s feeling regarding the book is probably due to conceptions formed by the Old Testament scriptures but so vital a place do these writings in the King James version occupy in the literary background of all English speaking people that a writer dealing with Hebraic subject matter cannot justifiably overlook their influence  Jehovah represents a big conception and theme and contains many fine lines but it is not a satisfying book It fails to give the reader a sense of ultimate reality  Nelson Antrim Crawford  CORRESPONDENCE  IN DEFENSE OF RODKER  Dear Editor of POETRY Please allow me to reply to Richard Aldington s criticism of the work of John Rodker printed in your October issue  Because Rodker is constantly groping for new methods in poetic style and because he sometimes attains these roads he must naturally arouse the anger of those who believe that poetry should stand still should forever observe the rules of that sublimated two times two equals four which men call simplicity I am however more tolerant than Mr Aldington I do not dislike candor simplicity naturalness and health but I cannot see why they should have an endless monopoly on English poetry I am also afraid that critics like Mr Aldington are inclined to rail at sexual frankness and intellectual complexities without understanding that health is not always a virtue when it lacks the keenness of other elements Besides this charge of unhealthiness is an easy and hollow gesture used by critics who possess no better arguments Mr Rodker s poetry is often involved and sardonic but it holds a bitter strength far removed from the flabby virulence of disease To some men only the movements of a child playing in a garden can be considered healthy  Mr Aldington charges Rodker with affectation and sneers at his mangled metaphors panted out in telegraphic journalese Rodker does not believe that life   In Defense of Rodker  is a succession of unbroken colors he spies tangled and elusive shades and strives to capture them with friendly metaphors After all coherence is a relative word Nietzsche and an Aleutian Islander would probably quarrel over its definition Its presence is a matter of taste and discernment To substantiate his contentions however Aldington adopts the old critical method of separating phrases and lines from their content distorting their meanings and taking care to select the poet s least representative lines At the other extreme we have critics who carefully select the best lines in a poet s work and strive to create an equally false and facile impression Quotations prove nothing unless they are fairly numerous and unmutilated I shall therefore refrain from quoting many beautiful lines in Mr Rodker s work and content myself with advising people to read it before pronouncing judgment Maxwell
