MARTIN  I suppose every married pair is bound, sooner or later, to be brought up short at the crossways in their life. You and I have reached that place, and it is obvious to me, if not to you, that we must take separate paths." This is the story of a man and a woman who loved each other much; but love of money for money's sake and a belief bred into the very marrow of his bones that woman is inferior to man, blinded the man to the higher things of life, and to the spiritual beauties and joys of marriage and home building. And so the wife, of clearer vision, fought a bitter battle to maintain her intellectual and spiritual entity. Beneath the humor and charm and dramatic power of Mrs. Martin s telling is an old, old problem, which, to-day, is so pressing and vital, so insistent in its call, that it seems new. And the joy of the ending leaves the reader glad. $1.50 For three years has Francis Little's   The Lady of the Decoration   been read, loved, and re-read.

Get it at any news- stand for fifteen cents  NOW while you can. Of these sixteen big features, perhaps you will prefer Ray Stannard Baker s   The Insurgent Republicans in the East   perhaps you will like best the story of the Education of William James Sidis, Harvard's mathematical prodigy   perhaps, like some of us, you will think the biggest thing is Stewart Edward White s   Is Ballinger Fit       or  Aldrich, The General Manager of the United States,  by Edwin Lcfevrc. Perhaps you will get the most fun out of those good stories by Lincoln Colcord, Ralph D. Paine, Mrs. Wilson Woodrow, Earl Derr Biggers, Inez Haynes Gillmore and William J. Locke. Perhaps you will get most pleasure out of Ida M. TarbelPs   Social Leaders Before the War    or "A Mexican Slave s Own Story  by a German who wfas forced into captivity. Perhaps   ou will be most pleased with  The New Theatre  with its beautiful illustrations   and per- haps, like many of us right here in the shop, you will find most joy in the discomfiture of Mr. Worldly Wiseman in The Interpreter s House.

In this book he tells the story of hunting big game in British East Africa, just before Colonel Roosevelt's trip over the same ground. And although he has had thirty years  stress of exposure, his enthusiasm is that of a man ol thirty-five   which gives his book excitement, vitality, and the most absorbing interest.   In Closed Territory " is a big book in every sense ; in scope, in experience, and in its importance to the world. Its appearance on their Spring list is a matter of great pride to the publishers.

They are wild flower gardens when the East is snow-bound, and from May to October the idler, angler, golfer, sportsman, or health-seeker will not experience a squall or rainstorm--- comfortable, beautiful days following one another. Dr. Holder spends much time there and says that he has 14 endeavored to present a clear picture of some of the pastimes and delights of this great playground.   I can wish the sport-loving reader no better luck,  he writes,   than that sometime he may with the lightest tackle, troll for the tuna, yellowtail, or sea bass on these azure seas.

DILLON WALLACE, of "Labrador T rail   fame, is enthusiastic over Mexico, the greatest of all equal areas in its hemisphere in natural wealth, climate and scenery, and most romantic in its history. He makes his reader most vividly aware of a practically untouched land of promise, with incomparable snow-capped mountain heights, vast plains, picturesque villages, ancient ruins, and historic towns. For the huntsman he pictures  an ideal hunting ground in these primeval solitudes, for it is a wilderness abounding in game, and almost unknown and unexplored.  Illustrated from Photographs.

His love aftairs, his efforts to establish himself, first in journalism and later in authorship, his varied and dramatic experiences and his friend- ships and acquaintances, are set forth with extraordinary psycho- logical insight and a wealth of vivid detail. The unexpectedness of the denoue- ment and its clarifying effect on the life drama that has been unfolded testify to Mr. Whitman s great literary skill. The story is a most original and astonishing picture of a phase of New York life, full of dramatic quality and thrilling interest.

Then the discovery of the true history of her mother's career, and of her own extraordinary parentage, the complications that follow her meeting with the doctor, her determined self-sacrifice, and the struggle ami development of the man himself ihrough his ordeal, make a vividly ro- mantic slorv.

T. Barnum s management, at Castle Garden, New York. The great show- man knew how to excite public interest, and on the evening of the first performance the crowd was so great that many who had bought seats could not get in. Richard Hoffman in a second article,  Some Musical Recollections of Fifty Years,  gives a graphic picture of the en- thusiasm of the great diva s reception. Mr. Hoffman became a member of the assisting company and gives many impressions of the fascination of Jenny Lind s singing and the charm of her personality which made her loved wherever she went.  Her rapt expression of face, and never-ending volume of voice made her appear like some inspired seraph deliver- ing a divine message.  Madame Jenny Lind Goldschmidt  she married Otto Goldschmidt, the pianist  never forgot the friends she had made in America or lost any of her admira- tion for the American character. Among other famous musicians numbered among Mr. Hoff- man s friends were Thalberg, who made his first appearance in this country at Niblo s in 1855; Gottschalk, Christine Nilsson, Rubin- stein, Dr. Hans von Biilow, and others. Mr. Hoffman s prediction that the great composers of the twentieth century will be found in Amer- ica will have serious consideration, coming from so high an authority. y  v One of the favorite resorts of painters from all over the world, and yet one but little visited by the tourist, is a little town in Finistere, Pont- Aven, nine or ten miles by stage west of Quim- perl . Every mile of the journey takes the ex- pectant visitor farther back into the past, and the little  slumberous  town is a painter s dream, an unending source of quaint costumes and char- acters. The tavern is always the gathering place for the artists, and many nationalities of painter- men will be found represented there. Corwin Knapp Linson will contribute a series of  Pont- Aven Vignettes  to the April Scribner, illus- trated with a number of his own drawings and paintings, some of the latter of which will be reproduced in colors. His first impressions as he drove into the town in the late afternoon, give some idea of the unu- sual interest and charm of the place.  Greeted by men with long locks straggling from under broad hats with pendent velvet rib- bons, high white collars reaching to the ears, and further clad in embroidered coats, baggy knee- breeches, gartered leggings, and wooden shoes, I experienced a delightfully uneasy feeling of the unreal, as in a dream of wonders from which one hesitates to awake.  No one who has written for the American stage was more widely known than the late Clyde Fitch. Within the twenty years of his active writing life, he contributed a surprising number of plays to the contemporary theatre. Their very number seems almost incredible, thirty- three original plays and twenty-three  drama- tizations  of novels or adaptations. Many of these were successes to an exceptional degree; and  The City,  the one that was not produced until after his death, has met with wide popularity. Walter Prichard Eaton has written an article for the April number on  The Dramatist as a Man of Letters The Case of Clyde Fitch,  in which he makes an analysis of the dramatist s place and work. Mr. Fitch had no exaggerated idea of the mission of the playwright; it was his purpose to hold the mirror up to nature as he felt and saw it, and that he succeeded in doing so, both with sincerity and truthfulness, few will deny. He has made a distinct place for himself, and his influence and example have been valuable.  The minute and faithful gift of observation which was his, gave Mr. Fitch s plays at once their most immediate appeal and most last- ing value.  The new serial  Rest Harrow,  by Maurice Hewlett, has won instant appreciation as a story of remarkable qualities, and the interest in the career of Sanchia, certainly one of the most fas- cinating women of modern fiction, increases with each new chapter. Both Sanchia and Senhouse are, to say the least, unusual types, children of nature, to whom the world is a place in which to live their own lives. There is a vein of idealism and poetry in all that Mr. Hewlett writes, and find fault if you will now and then with some of his people, there is no resisting the charm of his style, the appeal of his sentiment. There is an irresistible current of pure romance in every story. SCRlfi 'ER'$  l  r.  ZIXE .1PV ERTISER ;v.  HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS   Dough rises Best  when made from GOLD MEDAL FLOUR.

They hesitated about going, and when I had come as close as I dared, I mo- tioned to the two gun-bearers to continue walking, and dropped on one knee. I had the little Springfield, and was anxious to test the new sharp-pointed military bullet on some large animal. The biggest bull was half facing me, just two hundred and eighty yards off; I fired a little bit high and a trifle to the left; but the tiny ball broke his back and the splendid beast, heavy as a prize bull, came plunging and struggling to the ground. The other bull started to run off, but after I had walked a hundred yards forward, he actually trotted back toward his companion; then halted, turned, and galloped across my front at a distance of a hundred and eighty yards; and him too I brought down with a single shot. The little full-jacketed, sharp-pointed bullet made a terrific rending compared with the heavier, ordinary-shaped bullet of the same com- position. I was much pleased with my two prizes, for the National Museum particularly de- sired a good group of eland. They were splendid animals, like beautiful heavy cattle; and I could not sufficiently admire their sleek, handsome, striped coats, their shapely heads, fine horns, and massive bodies. The big bull, an old one, looked blue at a distance; he was very heavy and his dewlap hung down just as with cattle. His companion, although much less heavy, was a full-grown bull in his prime, with longer horns; for the big one's horns had begun to wear down at the tips. In their stomachs were grass, and, rather to my sur- prise, aloe leaves. We had two canvas cloths with us, which Heller had instructed me to put over any- thing I shot, in order to protect it from the sun; so, covering both bulls, 1 left a porter with them, and sent in another to notify Heller who came out with an ox-wagon to bring in the skins and meat. I had killed these two eland bulls, as well as the buck gazelle  bringing down each with a single bullet  within three-quarters of an hour after leaving camp. I wanted a topi, and continued the hunt. The country swarmed with the herds and flocks of the Masai, who own a wealth of live stock. Each herd of cattle and don- keys or flock of sheep was guarded by its herdsmen; bands of stalwart, picturesque warriors, with their huge spears and ox- Cuninghame and one of Mr. Roosevelt s Uubertsi heads.

We hailed loudly, explaining our needs. At first they were very suspicious. They told us we could not bring the lion within, because it would frighten the cattle, but after some parley consented to our building a fire out- side, and skinning the animal. They passed two brands over the thorn fence, and our men speedily kindled a blaze, and drew the pounds weight. The features of the men were bold and clear-cut, and their bearing warlike and self-reliant; as the flame of the fire glanced over them, and brought their faces and bronze figures into lurid relief against the darkness, the likeness was strik- ing, not to the West Coast negroes, but to the engravings on the tombs, temples, and palaces of ancient Egypt; they might have been soldiers in the armies of Thothmes or Aj  impalla ram.

By this time the Masai were reassured, and a score of their war- riors, followed soon by half a dozen women, came out through a small opening in the fence, and crowded close around the fire, with boisterous, noisy good humor. They showed a tendency to chall our porters. One, the humorist of the crowd, excited much merriment by describing, with pan- tomimic accompaniment of gestures, how when the white man shot a lion it might bite a swahili, who thereupon would call for his mother. But they were entirely friendly, and offered me calabashes of milk. The men were tall, finely shaped savages, their hair plastered with red mud, and drawn out into longish ringlets; they were naked ex- cept for a blanket worn, not round the loins, but over the shoulders; their ears were slit, and from them bone and wooden ornaments hung; they wore metal brace- lets and anklets, and chains which passed around their necks, or else over one side of the neck and under the opposite arm. The women had pleasant faces, and were laden with metal ornaments chiefly wire anklets, bracelets, and necklaces of many Rameses. They stood resting on their long staffs, and looked at me as I leaned on my rille; and they laughed and jested with their women, who felt the lion s teeth and claws and laughed back at the men; our gun-bearers worked at the skinning, and answered the jests of their warlike friends with the freedom of men who themselves followed a dangerous trade; the two horses stood quiet just outside the circle; and over all the firelight played and leaped. It was after ten when we reached camp, and I enjoyed a hot bath and a shave be- fore sitting down to a supper of eland veni- son and broiled spur-fowl; and surely no supper ever tasted more delicious. Next day we broke camp. My bag for the five days illustrates ordinary African shooting in this part of the continent. Of course I could have killed many other things; but 1 shot nothing that was not absolutely needed, both for scientific pur- poses and for food; the skin of every animal I shot was preserved for the National Museum. The bag included fourteen ani- mals, of ten different species: one lioness, one hyena, one warthog boar, two zebra. African Game Trails 277 two eland, one wildebeest, two 1    i, two impalla, one Roberts  gazelle, one Thom- sons gazelle. Kxeeot the lioness and one ini  alla  both o  which we sliot running , all were shot at rather long ranges; seven were shot standing, two walking, five run- ning. 1 he average distance at w hit h they were shot was a little over two hundred and twenty yards. I used sixty-five cartridges, an amount    hii Ii will seem excessive t liietly to those who are not accustomed aU.iallv to count the cartridges they expend, to measure the distances at which they lire and to estimate for themselves the range, on animals in the field when 'hey are stand ing or running a good way off.    nly one wounded animal got away; and eight o  the animals I shot had to be finished with one bullet two in the c ase ol the lioness as they lay on the ground. Many ol ihe cartridges expended really represented, range-finding. I have mentioned, this beautiful double-barrelled Holland rille was presented lu me by cer.ain English friends; Mr. I .. N.

TALES OF MEN THE LEGEND By Edith Wharton RTHUR BERNALD could never afterward recall just when the first conjecture flashed on him: oddly enough, there was no record of it in the agitated jottings of his diary. But, as it seemed to him in retrospect, he had always felt that the queer man at the Wades  must be John Pellerin, if only for the negative reason that he couldn t imaginably be any one else. It was impossible, in the confused pattern of the century s intellectual life, to fit the stranger in anywhere, save in the big gap which, some five and twenty years earlier, had been left by Pellerin s unac- countable disappearance; and conversely, such a man as the Wades  visitor couldn t have lived for sixty years without filling, somewhere in space, a nearly equivalent void. At all events, it was certainly not to Doc- tor Wade or to his mother I hat Bernald owed the hint: the good unconscious Wades, one of whose chief charms in the young man s eyes was that they remained so ro- bustly untainted by Pellerinism, in spite of the fact that Doctor Wade s younger brother, Howland, was among its most im- pudendy flourishing high-priests. The incident had begun by Bernald s running across Doctor Robert Wade one hot summer night at the University Club, and by Wade s saying, in the tone of un- professional laxity which the shadowy still- ness of the place invited:   I got hold of a queer fish at St. Martin s the other day  case of heat-prostration picked up in Cen- tral Park. When we d patched him up 1 found he had nowhere to go, and not a dol- lar in his pocket, and 1 sent him down to our place at Portchester to re-build.  Theopening roused his hearer s attention. Bob Wade had an odd unformulated sense of values that Bernald had learned to trust. 27S  What sort of chap  Young or old    Oh, every age full of years, and yet with a lot left. He called himself sixty on the books.    Sixty s a good age for some kinds of living. And age is of course purely sub- jective. How has he used his sixty years     Well part of them in educating him- self, apparently. He s a scholar human- ities, languages, and so forth.    Oh decayed gentleman,  Bemald murmured, disappointed.   Decayed   Not much    cried the doc- tor with his accustomed literalness.  I only mentioned that side of Winterman  his name s Winterman because it was the side my mother noticed first. I suppose women generally do. But it s only a part  a small part. The man s the big thing.    Really big     Well there again. . . . When I took him down to the country, looking rather like a tramp from a   Shelter,  with an un- trimmed beard, and a suit of reach-me- downs he d slept round the Park in for a week, I felt sure my mother d carry the sil- ver up to her room, and send for the gar- dener s dog to sleep in the hall the first night. But she didn t.    I see.   Women and children love him.  Oh, Wade   Bernald groaned.  Not a bit of it  You're out again. We don t love him, either of us. But we feel him the air s charged with him. You ll see.  And Bemald agreed that he would see, the following Sunday. Wade s inarticulate attempts to characterize the stranger had struck his friend. The human revelation had for Bernald a poignant and ever-re- newed interest, which his trade, as the dra- matic critic of a daily paper, had hitherto failed to discourage. And he knew that Bob Wade, simple and undefiled by litera- ture Bernald s specific affliction had a free and personal way of judging men, and the diviner s knack of reaching their hidden The Legend 279 springs. During the clays that followed, the young doctor gave Bernald farther de- tails about John Winterman: details not of fact for in that respect his visitor s re- ticence was baffling but of impression. It appeared that Winterman, while lying insensible in the Park, had been robbed of the few dollars he possessed; and on leav- ing the hospital, still weak and half-blind, he had quite simply and unprotestingly ac- cepted the Wades  offer to give him shelter till such time as he should be strong enough to go to work.  But what s his work   Bernald inter- jected.   Hasn t he at least told you that     Well, writing. Some kind of writing.  Doctor Bob always became vague and clumsy when he approached the confines of literature.   He means to take it up again as soon as his eyes get right.  Bemald groaned.   Oh, Lord that fin- ishes him; and me   He s looking for a pub- lisher, of course he wants a  favourable notice.  I won t come    He hasn t written a line for twenty years.    A line of what   What kind of litera- ture can one keep corked up for twenty years   Wade surprised him.  The real kind, I should say. But I don t know Winter- man s line,  the doctor added.   He speaks of the things he used to write merely as  stuff that wouldn t sell.  He has a won- derfully confidential way of not telling one things. But he says lie ll have to do some- thing for his living as soon as his eyes are patched up, and that writing is the only trade he knows. The queer thing is that he seems pretty sure of selling now. He even talked of buying the bungalow of us, with an acre or two about it.    The bungalow   What s that       The studio down by the shore that we built for Howland when he thought he meant to paint.   Howland Wade, as Bernald knew, had experienced various   calls.     Since he s taken to writing no- body s been near it. I offered it to Win- terman, and he camps there cooks his meals, does his own house-keeping, and never comes up to the house except in the evenings, when he joins us on the verandah, in the dark, and smokes while my mother knits.    A discreet visitor, eh     More than he need be. My mother actually wanted him to stay on in the house  in her pink chintz room. Think of it  But he says houses smother him. I take it he s lived for years in the open.   In the open where     I can t make out, except that it was somewhere in the East.   East of every- thing beyond the day-spring. In places not on the map.  That s the way he put it; and when I said:  You ve, been an ex- plorer, then   he smiled in his beard, and answered:  Yes; that s it an explorer.  Yet he doesn t strike me as a man of action: hasn t the hands or the eyes.    What sort of hands and eyes has he   Wade reflected. His range of observa- tion was not large, but within its limits it was exact and could give an account of it- self.   He s worked a lot with his hands, but that s not what they were made for. I should say they were extraordinarily deli- cate conductors of sensation. And his eye  his eye too. He hasn t used it to domi- nate people: he didn t care to. He simply looks through  em all like windows. Makes me feel like the fellows who think they re made of glass. The mitigating circum- stance is that he seems to see such a glorious landscape through me.  Wade grinned at the thought of serving such a purpose.  I see. I ll come on Sunday and be looked through   Bernald cried. II Bernald came on two successive Sun- days; and the second time he lingered till the Tuesday.  Here he comes   Wade had said, the first evening, as the two young men, with Wade s mother sat in the sultry dusk, with the Virginian creeper drawing, between the verandah arches, its black arabesques against a moon-lined sky. In the darkness Bernald heard a step on the gravel, and saw the red flit of a cigar through the shrubs. Then a loosely-mov- ing figure obscured the patch of sky be- tween the creepers, and the red spark be- came the centre of a dim bearded face, in which Bernald discerned only a broad white gleam of forehead. It was the young man s subsequent im- pression that Winterman had not spoken The Legend mm Ii i Iu I Ii r.-t evening; al any r. 11   . Im rn.iM 1 iim-i lf ri-nu-iiil u-n J . Iiicily v.

I have him crammed down my throat even in hospital. The in- ternes read him at the i linics. He tumbles out of the nurses  pockets. The patients keep him under their pillows, oh. with most of them, of course, it's just a craze, like the last new game or puzzle: they don't understand him in the least. Howland says that even now. twenty-live vears after his death, and with his books in every- body's hands, there are not twenty people who really understand Pcllerin; and How- land ought to know, if anybody does. He's w hat s their great word t  inter- preted him. You m.ist get Howland tu put you through a course   t Pcllerin.  And as the young men. having taken leave of Winterman, retraced their way across the lawn, Wade continued to develop the theme of his brother s ai t omplishments.   I wish I emdd get Howland to take an interest in Winternan: this is Ihe third Sunday lie's chucked us.   f course he does get I "  re  1 with    e   pli  i on suit ing him about their writings  but 1 believe if he could only talk to Winterman he d see something in him, as we do. Ai d it would be such a god-send to the poor man to have some one to advise him about his work. I m go- ing to make a desperate effort to get How- land here next Sunday.  It was then that Bernald vowed to him- self that he would return the next Sunday at all costs. He hardly knew whether he was prompted by the impulse to shield Win- ternian from Howland Wade's ineptitude, or by the desire to see the latter abandon himself to the full shamelessness ol its dis- play; but of one fact he was blissfully as- sured and that was of the existence in Winterman of some quality which would provoke I lowland to the amplest exen ise of his fatuity. "How he'll draw him how he'll draw him " Bernald chuckled, with a sei ii ri ly the more una  t ountable that his one glimpse of Winterman had shown the latter only as a passive subject for experi- mentation; and he felt himself avenged in advance lor the injury of How land W ade's existence. Ill That this hope was to be frustrated Ber- nald learned from How lane Wade's own lips, theday before the two young men were to meet at I orti hester.   1 ian't really, my dear fellow ." the In- terpreter lisped, passing a polished hand over the faded smoothness of his fate. "Oil, an authentic engagement, I assure you: otherwise, lo oblige old Bob I d sub- mit cheerfully to looking over his found- ling's literature. But I m pledged this week to the Pcllerin Society of Kenosha: 1 had a hand in founding it, and for two years now thev'vc been patiently wait ng tor a word from me the Fiat Lux. so to speak. You see it's a ministry, Bernald    assure you, 1 look upon my calling quite religiously." As Bernald listened, his disappointment gradually changed to relief Howland, on trial, always turned out to he too insuffer- able, and the pleasure of watching his antic s was invariably lost in the impulse to put a sanguinary end to then. " If he'd  mly kec-   his I eastly  link hands off Pcllerin,  Bernald groaned, thinking of the thick manuscript condemned to per- petual incarceration in his own desk by the publication of Howland s  definitive  work on the great man. One couldn't, after Howland Wade, expose one's self to the derision of writing about Pcllerin: the eagerness with whie h Wade's hi  k had I  een devoured proved, not that the public had enough appetite for another, but simply that, for a stoma  h so undiscriminating, anything better than Wade had given it would be too good. And Bernald, in the confidence that lib own work was open to this objection, had stoically locked il up. Yet if lie had resigned his exasperated in- telligence to the fact that Wade's hook ex- 282 The Legend isted, and was already passing into the immortality of perpetual republication, he could not, after repeated trials, adjust him- self to the author s talk about Pellerin. When Wade wrote of the great dead he was egregious, but in conversation he was fa- miliar and fond. It might have been sup- posed that one of the beauties of Pellerin s hidden life and mysterious taking off would have been to guard him from the fingering of anecdote; but biographers like Howland Wade were born to rise above such obsta- cles. He might be vague or inaccurate in dealing with the few recorded events of his subject s life; but when he left fact for con- jecture no one had a firmer footing. Whole chapters in his volume were constructed in the conditional mood and packed with hypothetical detail; and in talk, by the very law of the process, hypothesis became affirmation, and he was ready to tell you confidentially the exact circumstances of Pellerin s death, and of the  distressing incident  leading up to it. Bernald himself not only questioned the form under which this incident was shaping itself before pos- terity, but the mere radical fact of its oc- currence : he had never been able to discov- er any break in the dense cloud enveloping Pellerin s later life and its mysterious termi- nation. He had gone away that was all that any of them knew: he who had so little, at any time, been with them or of them; and his going had so slightly stirred the pub- lic consciousness that even the subsequent news of his death, laconically imparted from afar, had dropped unheeded into the universal scrap-basket, to be long afterward fished out, with all its details missing, when some enquiring spirit first became aware, by chance encounter with a two-penny vol- ume in a London book-stall, not only that such a man as John Pellerin had died, but that he had ever lived, or written. It need hardly be noted that Howland Wade had not been the pioneer in question: his had been the wiser part of swelling the chorus when it rose, and gradually drown- ing the other voices by his own insistent note. He had pitched the note so scream- ingly, and held it so long, that he was now the accepted authority on Pellerin, not only in the land which had given birth to his genius but in the Europe which had first ac- claimed it; and it was the central point of pain in Bernald s sense of the situation that a man who had so yearned for silence as Pellerin should have his grave piped over by such a voice as Wade s. Bernald s talk with the Inteqireter had revived this ache to the momentary exclu- sion of other sensations; and he was still sore with it when, the next afternoon, he arrived at Portchester for his second Sun- day with the Wades. At the station he had the surprise of see- ing Winterman s face on the platform, and of hearing from him that Doctor Bob had been called away to assist at an operation in a distant town.   Mrs. Wade wanted to put you off, but I believe the message came too late; so she sent me down to break the news to you,  said Winterman, holding out his hand. Perhaps because they were the first con- ventional words that Bernald had heard him speak, the young man was struck by the relief his intonation gave them.   She wanted to send a carriage,  Win- terman added,  but I told her we d walk back through the woods.  He looked at Bernald with a sudden kindness that flushed the young man with pleasure.   Are you strong enough   It s not too far    Oh, no. I m pulling myself together. Getting back to work is the slowest part of the business: not on account of my eyes  I can use them now, though not for reading; but some of the links between things are missing. It s a kind of broken spectrum . . , here, that boy will look after your bag.  The walk through the woods remained in Bemald s memory as an enchanted hour. He used the word literally, as descriptive of the way in which Winterman s contact changed the face of tilings, or perhaps re- stored them to their primitive meanings. And the scene they traversed one of those little untended woods that still, in America, fringe the tawdry skirts of civilization ac- quired, as a background to Winterman, the hush of a spot aware of transcendent visit- ings. Did he talk, or did he make Bernald talk  The young man never knew. He recalled only a sense of lightness and libera- tion, as if the hard walls of individuality had melted, and he were merged in the poet s deeper interfusion, yet without losing the least sharp edge of self. This general impression resolved itself afterward into the The Legend 283 sense of Winterman s wide elemental range. His thought encircled things like the hori- zon at sea. He didn t, as it happened, touch on lofty themes Bernald was glee- fully aware that, to Howland Wade, their talk would hardly have been Talk at all  but Winterman s mind, applied to lowly topics, was like a powerful lens that brought out microscopic delicacies and differences. The lack of Sunday trains kept Doctor Bob for two days on the scene of his sur- gical duties, and during those two days Ber- nald seized every moment of communion with his friend s guest. Winterman, as Wade had said, was reticent as to his per- sonal affairs, or rather as to the practical and material conditions to which the term is generally applied. . But it was evident that, in Winterman s case, the usual classi- fication must be reversed, and that the dis- cussion of ideas carried one much farther into his intimacy than any specific acquaint- ance with the incidents of his life.  That s exactly what Howland Wade and his tribe have never understood about Pellerin: that it s much less important to know how, or even why, he disapp-  Bernald pulled himself up with a jerk, and turned to look full at his companion. It was late on the Monday evening, and the two men, after an hour s chat on the veran- dah to the tune of Mrs. Wade s knitting- needles, had bidden their hostess good- night and strolled back to the bungalow to- gether.   Come and have a pipe before you turn in,  Winterman had said; and they had sat on together till midnight, with the door of the bungalow open on a heaving moonlit bay, and summer insects bumping against the chimney of the lamp. Winterman had just bent down to re fill his pipe from the jar on the table, and Bernald, jerking about to catch him in the yellow circle of lamp- light, sat speechless, staring at a fact that seemed suddenly to have substituted itself for Winterman s face, or rather to have ta- ken on its features.   No, they never saw that Pellerin s ideas were Pellerin. . . .  He continued to stare at Winterman.  Just as this man s ideas are why, are Pellerin    The thought uttered itself in a kind of inner shout, and Bernald started upright with the violent impact of his conclusion. Again and again in the last forty-eight hours he had exclaimed to himself:  This is as good as Pellerin.  Why hadn t he said till now:  This is Pellerin   . . . Surprising as the answer was, he had no choice but to take it. He hadn t said so simply because Winterman was belter than Pellerin that there was so much more of him, so to speak. Yes; but it came to Bernald in a llash wouldn t there by this time have been any amount more of Pel- lerin  . . . The young man felt actually dizzy with the thought. That was it  there was the solution of the haunting prob- lem  This man was Pellerin, and more than Pellerin  It was so fantastic and yet so unanswerable that he burst into a sud- den startled laugh. Winterman, at the same moment, brought his palm down with a sudden crash on the pile of manuscript covering the desk.  What s the matter   Bernald gasped.   My match wasn t out. In another min- ute the destruction of the library of Alex- andria would have been a trifle compared to what you d have seen.  Winterman, with his large deep laugh, shook out the smouldering sheets.  And I should have been a pensioner on Doctor Bob the Lord knows how much longer   Bernald pulled himself together.  You ve really got going again  The thing s actu- ally getting into shape    This particular thing is in shape. I drove at it hard all last week, thinking our friend s brother would be down on Sun- day, and might look it over.  Bernald had to repress the tendency to another wild laugh.  Howland you meant to show How- land what you ve done   Winterman, looming against the moon- light, slowly turned a dusky shaggy head toward him.   Isn t it a good thing to do   Bernald wavered, torn between loyalty to his friends and the grotesqueness of answer- ing in the affirmative. After all, it was none of his business to furnish Winterman with an estimate of Howland Wade.   Well, you see, you ve never told me what your line is,  he answered, temporiz- ing.   No, because nobody s ever told me. It s exactly what I want to find out,  said the other genially.  And you expect Wade-   The Lc vncl 'Win, I gat lie ret I In mi mir gt   nl I     1   r th.it it's Iii-. trade. limsn't he i-x  kiin- inti n  ret     "In his nun  Imn.iin   w hi- h is IVllcr i 11 i - n i.      inlcrman gazed mil musingly u    u the mn. hi t  nh lu-il i hi I. ul" w aliT'.

The Legend 285 Then, in Cashmere one day, I met a fellow in a caravan, with a dog-eared book in his pocket. He said he never stirred without it  wanted to know where I d been, never to have heard of it. It was my guess in its twentieth edition  . . . The globe spun round at that, and all of a sudden I was under the old stars. That s the way it hap- pens when the ballast of vanity shifts  I d lived a third of a life out there, unconscious of human opinion because I supposed it was unconscious of me. But now now  Oh, it was different. I wanted to know what they said. . . .Not exactly that, either: I wanted to know what I d made them say. There s a difference. . . . And here I am,  said John Pellerin, with a pull at his pipe. So much Bernald retained of his com- panion s actual narrative; the rest was swept away under the tide of wonder that rose and submerged him as Pellerin at some indefinitely later stage of their talk  picked up his manuscript and began to read. Bernald sat opposite, his elbows propped on the table, his eyes fixed on the swaying waters outside, from which the moon gradually faded, leaving them to make a denser blackness in the night. As Pellerin read, this density of blackness  which never for a moment seemed inert or unalive was attenuated by imperceptible degrees, till a greyish pallour replaced it; then the pallour breathed and brightened, and suddenly dawn was on the sea. Something of the same nature went on in the young man s mind while he watched and listened. He was conscious of a grad- ually withdrawing light, of an interval of obscurity full of the stir of invisible forces, and then of the victorious flush of day. And as the light rose, he saw how far he had travelled and what wonders the night had prepared. Pellerin had been right in say- ing that his first idea had survived, had borne the test of time; but he had given his hearer no hint of the extent to which it had been enlarged and modified, of the fresh implications it now unfolded. In a brief flash of retrospection Bernald saw the earlier books dwindle and fall into their place as mere precursors of this fuller reve- lation; then, with a leap of helpless rage, he pictured Howland Wade s pink hands on the new treasure, and his prophetic feet up- on the lecture platform. V  It won t do oh, he let him down as gently as possible; but it appears it simply won t do.  Doctor Bob imparted the ineluctable fact to Bernald while the two men, accidentally meeting at their club a few nights later, sat together over the dinner they had imme- diately agreed to consume in company. Bernald had left Portchester the morning after his strange discovery, and he and Bob Wade had not seen each other since. And now Bernald, moved by an irresistible in- stinct of postponement, had waited for his companion to bring up Winterman s name, and had even executed several conversa- tional diversions in the hope of delaying its mention. For how could one talk of Win- terman with the thought of Pellerin swell- ing one s breast     Yes; the very day Howland got back from Kenosha I brought the manuscript to town, and got him to read it. And yester- day evening I nailed him, and dragged an answer out of him.    Then Howland hasn t seen Winterman yet       No. He said:   Before you let him loose on me I ll go over the stuff, and see if it s at all worth while.    Bernald drew a freer breath.  And he found it wasn t     Between ourselves, he found it was of no account at all. Queer, isn t it, when the man . . . but of course literature s an- other proposition. Howland says it s one of the cases where an idea might seem origi- nal and striking if one didn t happen to be able to trace its descent. And this is straight out of bosh by Pellerin. . . . Yes: Pel- lerin. It seems that everything in the arti- cle that isn t pure nonsense is just Peller- inism. Howland thinks poor Winterman must have been tremendously struck by Pellerin s writings, and have lived too much out of the world to know that they ve be- come the text-books of modern thought. Otherwise, of course, he d have taken more trouble to disguise his plagiarisms.    I see,  Bernald mused.   Yet you say there is an original element       Yes; but unluckily it s no good.   It s not conceivably in any sense a development of Pellerin s idea: a logical step farther   286 The Legend .   Logical  Howland says it s twaddle at white heat.  Bernald sat silent, divided between the fierce satisfaction of seeing the Interpreter rush upon his fate, and the despair of know- ing that the state of mind he represented was indestructible. Then both emotions were swept away on a wave of pure joy, as he reflected that now, at last, Howland Wade had given him back John Pellerin. The possession was one he did not mean to part with lightly; and the dread of its being torn from him constrained him to ex- traordinary precautions.  You ve told Winterman, I suppose  How did he take it     Why, unexpectedly, as he does most things. You can never tell which way he ll jump. I thought he d take a high tone, or else laugh it off; but he did neither. He seemed awfully cast down. I wished my- self well out of the job when I saw how cut up he was.  Bernald thrilled at the words. Pellerin had shared his pang, then the  old woe of the world  at the perpetuity of human dtlness   But what did he say to the charge of plagiarism if you made it     Oh, I told him straight out what How- land said. I thought it fairer. And his answer to that was the rummest part of all.   What was it   Bernald questioned, with a tremor.   He said:  That s queer, for I ve never read Pellerin.    Bernald drew a deep breath of ecstasy.   Well and I suppose you believed him       I believed him, because I know him. But the public won t the critics won t. And if it s a pure coincidence it s just as bad for him as if it were a straight steal  isn t it   Bernald sighed his acquiescence.   It bothers me awfully,  Wade contin- ued, knitting his kindly brows,   because I could see what a blow it was to him. He s got to earn his living, and I don t suppose he knows how to do anything else. At his age it s hard to start fresh. I put that to Howland asked him if there wasn t a chance he might do better if he only had a little encouragement. I can t help feeling he s got the essential thing in him. But of course I m no judge when it comes to books. And Howland says it would be cruel to give him any hope.  Wade paused, turned his wineglass about under a meditative stare, and then leaned across the table toward Bernald.   Look here do you know what I ve proposed to Winterman  That he should come to town with me to-morrow and go in the evening to hear Howland lect- ure to the Uplift Club. They re to meet at Mrs. Beecher Bain s, and Howland is to re- peat the lecture that he gave the other day before the Pellerin Society at Kenosha. It will give Winterman a chance to get some no- tion of what Pellerin was: he ll get it much straighter from Howland than if he tried to plough through Pellerin s books. And then afterward as if accidentally I thought I might bring him and Howland together. If Howland could only see him and hear him talk, there s no knowing what might come of it. He couldn t help feeling the man s force, as we do; and he might give him a pointer tell him what line to take. Anyhow, it would please Winterman, and take the edge off his disappointment. I saw that as soon as I proposed it.   Some one who s never heard of Pel- lerin     Mrs. Beecher Bain,large, smiling, diffuse, reached out parenthetically from the incom- ing throng on her threshold to waylay Ber- nald with the question as he was about to move past her in the wake of his com- panion.  Oh, keep straight on, Mr. Winter- man   she interrupted herself to call after the latter.  Into the back drawing-room, please  And remember, you re to sit next to me in the comer on the left, close under the platform.  She renewed her interrogative clutch on Bemald s sleeve.   Most curious  Doctor Wade has been telling me all about him  how remarkable you al  think him. And it s actually true that he s never heard of Pellerin  Of course as soon as Doctor Wade told me that, I said  Bring him    It will be so extraordinarily interesting to watch the first impression. Yes, do follow him, dear Mr. Bernald, and be sure that you and he secure the seats next to me. Of course Alice Fosdick insists on being with us. She was wild with excitement when I told her she was to meet some one who d never heard of Pellerin    On the indulgent lips of Mrs. Beecher Bain conjecture speedily passed into af- The Legend 287 firmation; and as Bernald s companion, broad and shaggy in his visibly new even- ing clothes, moved down the length of the crowded rooms, he was already, to the ladies drawing aside their skirts to let him pass, the interesting Huron of the fable. How far he was aware of the character ascribed to him it was impossible for Ber- nald to discover. He was as unconscious as a tree or a cloud, and his observer had never known any one so alive to human contacts and yet so secure from them. But the scene was playing such a lively tune on Bernald s own sensibilities that for the mo- ment he could not adjust himself to the probable effect it produced on his compan- ion. The young man, of late, had made but rare appearances in the group of which Mrs. Beecher Bain was one of the most in- defatigable hostesses, and the Uplift Club the chief medium of expression. To a critic, obliged by his trade to cultivate convic- tions, it was the essence of luxury to leave  hem at home in his hours of ease; and Bernald gave his preference to circles in which less finality of judgment prevailed, and it was consequently less embarrassing to be caught without an opinion. But in his fresher days he had known the spell of the Uplift Club and the thrill of moving among, the Emancipated; and he felt an odd sense of rejuvenation as he looked at the rows of faces packed about the embowered platform from which How- land Wade was presently to hand down the eternal verities. Many of these counte- nances belonged to the old days, when the gospel of Pellerin was unknown, and it re- quired considerable intellectual courage to avow one s acceptance of the very doctrines he had since demolished. The latter moral revolution seemed to have been accepted as submissively as a change in hair-dressing; and it even struck Bernald that, in the case of many of the assembled ladies, their con- victions were rather newer than their clothes. One of the most interesting examples of this facility of adaptation was actually, in the person of Miss Alice Fosdick, brushing his elbow with exotic amulets, and envelop- ing him in Arabian odours, as she leaned forward to murmur her sympathetic sense of the situation. Miss Fosdick, who was one of the most advanced exponents of Pel- lerinism, had large eyes and a plaintive mouth, and Bernald had always fancied that she might have been pretty if she had not been perpetually explaining things.   Yes, I know Isabella Bain told me all about him.  He can t hear us, can he    And I wonder if you realize how remark- ably interesting it is that we should have such an opportunity now I mean the op- portunity to see the impression of Pellerin- ism on a perfectly fresh mind.  You must introduce him as soon as the lecture s over.  I explained that to Isabella as soon as she showed me Doctor Wade s note. Of course you see why, don t you   Bernald made a faint motion of acquiescence, which she instantly swept aside.  At least I think I can make you see why.  If you re sure he can t hear   Why, it s just this Pellerin- ism is in danger of becoming a truism. Oh, it s an awful thing to say  But then I m not afraid of saying awful things  I rather believe it s my mission. What I mean is, that we re getting into the way of taking Pellerin for granted as we do the air we breathe. We don t sufficiently lead our conscious life in him we re gradu- ally letting him become subliminal.  She swayed closer to the young man, and he saw that she was making a graceful attempt to throw her explanatory net over his com- panion, who, evading Mrs. Bain s hospita- ble signal, had cautiously wedged himself into a seat between Bernald and the wall.  Did you hear what I was saying, Mr. Winterman   Yes, I know who you are, of course   Oh, well, I don t really mind if you did. I was talking about you about you and Pellerin. I was explaining to Mr. Bernald that what we need at this very min- ute is a Pellerin revival; and we need some one like you to whom his message comes as a wonderful new interpretation of life  to lead the revival, and rouse us out of our apathy. . . .   You see,  she went on winningly,  it s not only the big public that needs it  of course Iheir Pellerin isn t ours   It s we, his disciples, his interpreters, who discov- ered him and gave him to the world we, the Chosen People, the Custodians of the Sacred Books, as Howland Wade calls us  it s we, who are in perpetual danger of sink- ing back into the old stagnant ideals, and practising the Seven Deadly Virtues; it s we who need to count our mercies, and realize anew what he s done for us, and what we ought to do for him  And it s for 288 The Legend that reason that I urged Mr. Wade to speak here, in the very inner sanctuary of Peller- inism, exactly as he would speak to the un- initiated to repeat, simply, his Kenosha lecture,   What Pelierinism means  ; and we ought all, I think, to listen to him with the hearts of little children just as you will, Mr. Winterman as if he were telling us new things, and we     Alice, dear   Mrs. Bain murmured with a deprecating gesture; and Howland Wade, emerging between the palms, took the centre of the platform. A pang of commiseration shot through Bernald as he saw him there, so innocent and so exposed. His plump pulpy body, which made his evening dress fall into intimate and wrapper-like folds, was like a wide surface spread to the shafts of irony; and the mild ripples of his voice seemed to enlarge the vulnerable area as he leaned forward, poised on confidential finger-tips, to say persuasively:   Let me try to tell you what Pelierinism means.  Bernald moved restlessly in his seat. He had the obscure sense of being a party to something not wholly honourable. He ought not to have come; he ought not to have let his companion come. Yet how could he have done otherwise  John Pel- lerin s secret was his own. As long as he chose to remain John Winterman it was no one s business to gainsay him; and Ber- nald s scruples were really justifiable only in respect of his own prescncc on the scene. But even in this connection he ceased to feel them as soon as Howland Wade began to speak. VI It had been arranged that Pellerin, after the meeting of the Uplift Club, should join Bernald at his rooms and spend the night there, instead of returning to Portchester. The plan had been eagerly elaborated by the young man, but he had been unprepared for the alacrity with which his wonderful friend accepted it. He was beginning to see that it was a part of Pellerin s wonder- fulness to fall in, quite simply and natur- ally, with any arrangements made for his convenience, or tending to promote the con- venience of others. Bernald felt that his extreme docility in such matters was propor- tioned to the force of resistance which, for nearly half a life-time, had kept him, with his back to the wall, fighting alone against the powers of darkness. In such a scale of values how little the small daily alternatives must weigh  At the close of Howland Wade s dis- course, Bernald, charged with his prodig- ious secret, had felt the need to escape for an instant from the liberated rush of talk. The interest of watching Pellerin was so perilously great that the watcher felt it might, at any moment, betray him. He lingered in the crowded drawing-room long enough to see his friend enclosed in a mounting tide, above which Mrs. Beecher Bain and Miss Fosdick actively waved their conversational tridents; then he took ref- uge, at the back of the house, in a small dim library where, in his younger days, he had discussed personal immortality and the problem of consciousness with beautiful girls whose names he could not remember. In this retreat he surprised Mr. Beecher Bain, a quiet man with a mild brow, who was smoking a surreptitious cigar over the last number of the Strand. Mr. Bain, at Bemald s approach, dissembled the Strand under a copy of the Hibbert Journal, but tendered his cigar-case with the remark that stocks were heavy again; and Bernald blissfully abandoned himself to this unex- pected contact with reality. On his return to the drawing-rooms he found that the tide had set toward the sup- per-table, and when it finally carried him thither it was to land him in the welcoming arms of Bob Wade.   Hullo, old man  Where have you been all this time   Winterman   Oh, he s talk- ing to Howland: yes, I managed it finally. I believe Mrs. Bain has steered them into the library, so that they shan t be disturbed. T gave her an idea of the situation, and she was awfully kind. We d better leave them alone, don  you think   I m trying to get a croquette for Miss Fosdick.  Bernald s secret leapt in his bosom, and he devoted himself to the task of distribut- ing sandwiches and champagne while his pulses danced to the tune of the cosmic laughter. The vision of Pellerin and his Interpreter, face to face at last, had a Cy- clopean grandeur that dwarfed all other comedy.   And I shall hear of it presently; in an hour or two he ll be telling me about it. And that hour will be all mine mine and his   The dizziness of the thought made it The Legend difficult for Bernald to preserve the balatic e of the supper-plates he was   1 ist ri I  li ti n s . Life had for him at that moment the com- pleteness which seems to defy disintegra- tn  n. The throng in the dining-room was thickening, and Bernald's efforts as purvey- or were interrupted by freijuent a    eaIs, from ladies who had reached repleteness, that he should sit down a moment and tell them all about his interesting friend. Win- terman s fame, trumpeted abroad by Miss Fosdick, had reached the four corners of the Uplift Club, and Bernald found him- self fabricating de Ionics pi ires a Winter- man legend which should in some degree respond to the Club s demand for the hu- man document. When at length he had acquitted himself of this obligation, and was free to work his way back through ihe lessening groups into the drawing-room, he was at Iasi rewarded by a glimpse of his friend, who, still densely encompassed, towered in the centre of the room in all his sovran ugliness. Their eyes met across the crowd; but Bernald gathered onlv perplexity from the encounter. What were Pellerin s eyes sav- ing to him  What orders, what confi- dences, what indefinable apprehension did their long look impart  The young man was still trying to decipher their complex message when he felt a tap on the arm, and turned to encounter the rueful gaze of Bob W ade, whose meaning lay clearly enough on the surface of his good blue stare.  Well, it won t work it won t work,   the doctor groaned.   What w   n't      I mean with Howland. Winterman won t. H ow land doesn't take lo him. Says lie's crude frightfully crude. And you know how Howland hates crudeness.'  "Oh, I know,  Bernald exulted. It was the word he had waited for he saw it now   Once more he was lost in wonder al How - land s miraculous faculty for always, as the naturalists said, being true to type. "So I m afraid it s all up with his chance of writing. At least I can do no more," said Wade, discouraged. Bernald pressed him for farther details.  Does Winterman seem to mind much  Did you hear his version     His version      I mean what he said to Howland.    Why no.    hat the deuce was there for him to sav     "Wliat indeed  I think I'll take him home," said Bernald gaily. He turned away to join the   in Ie Iron  whii h. a few minutes belore, Pellcrin s eye- had vainly and enigmatically signalled lo him; but the   in Ie had dispersed, and Pcl- lerin himself was not in sight. Bernald, looking about him, saw that dur- ing his brief aside w illi Wade the party had passed into the final phase of dissolution. 1 eople still delaved, in diminishing groups, but the current had set toward the doors, and every moment or two it bore away a few more lingerers. Bernald, Irom his post, commanded the clearing perspective of the two drawing-rooms, and a rapid sur- vey of their length sufficed to assure him that Pellerin was not in either. Taking leave of Wade, the young man made his wav back lo the drawing-room, where only a few hardened feaslers remained, and then passed on to the library whii h had been the scene of the late momentous i olloquv. But the library too was empty, and drifting bai k uncertainly to the inner draw ing room Bernald found Mrs. Beecher Bain domes- tically putting out the wax candles on the mantel-piece. "Dear Mr. Bernald  Do sit down and have a little i hat. W hat a wonderful priv i- lege it has been  I don't know when I've had sue h an intense impressiiin.  She made way for him, hospitably, in a corner of the sofa to which she had sunk; and he echoed her vaguely; "You ere impressed, then  " "I can't express to you how it affected me  As Alic e said, il was a resurrec tion it was as il John Pellerin were ai tuallv here- in the room with us " Bernald turned on her with a half-audi blegasp. " You fell that, dear Mrs. Bain " " We all felt it every one of us  I don't wonder the Oreeks it :cas the  irecks  regarded eloquence as a supernatural pow er. As Alice says, when one looked at How - land Wade one understood what they meant bv the Afflatus." Bernald rose and held out his hand      h, I see  it vv as How land win i made you feel as if Pellerin were in the room  And he made Miss I'osdic k feel so too " " W hy, of c ourse. But w In are you rush- ing off " 290 The Legend   Because I must hunt up my friend, who s not used to such late hours.    Your friend   Mrs. Bain had to col- lect her thoughts.   Oh, Mr. Winterman, you mean   But he s gone already.   Gone   Bernald exclaimed, with an odd twinge of foreboding. Remembering Pellerin s signal across the crowd, he re- proached himself for not having answered it more promptly.. Yet it was certainly strange that his friend should have left the house without him.   Are you quite sure    he asked, with a startled glance at the clock.   Oh, perfectly. He went half an hour ago. But you needn t hurry home on his account, for Alice Fosdick carried him off with her. I saw them leave together.   Carried him off  She took him home with her, you mean      Yes. You know what strange hours she keeps. She told me she was going to give him a Welsh rabbit, and explain Pel- lerinism to him.    Oh, if she s going to explain   Ber- nald murmured. But his amazement at the news struggled with a confused im- patience to reach his rooms in time to be there for his friend s arrival. There could be no stranger spectacle beneath the stars than that of John Pellerin carried off by Miss Fosdick, and listening, in the small hours, to her elucidation of his doctrines; but Bemald knew enough of his sex to be aware that such an experiment may present a less humorous side to its subject than to an impartial observer. Even the Uplift Club and its connotations might benefit by the attraction of the unknown; and it was conceivable that to a traveller from Mesopo- tamia Miss Fosdick might present elements of interest which she had lost for the fre- quenters of Fifth Avenue. There was, at any rate, no denying that the affair had become unexpectedly complex, and that its farther development promised to be rich in comedy. In the charmed contemplation of these possibilities Bernald sat over his fire, lis- tening for Pellerin s ring. He had ar- ranged his modest quarters with the rever- ent care of a celebrant awaiting the descent of his deity. He guessed Pellerin to be un- conscious of visual detail, but sensitive to the happy blending of sensuous impres- sions: to the intimate spell of lamplight on books, and of a deep chair placed where one could watch the fire. The chair was there, and Bernald, facing it across the hearth, already saw it filled by Pellerin s lounging figure. The autumn dawn came late, and even now they had before them the promise of some untroubled hours. Bernald, sitting there alone in the warm stillness of his room, and in the profounder hush of his ex- pectancy, was conscious of gathering up all his sensibilities and perceptions into one ex- quisitely-adjusted instrument of notation. Until now he had tasted Pellerin s society only in unpremeditated snatches, and had always left him with a sense, on his own part, of waste and shortcoming. Now, in the lull of this dedicated hour, he felt that he should miss nothing, and forget nothing, of the initiation that awaited him. And catching sight of Pellerin s pipe, he rose and laid it carefully on a table by the arm-chair.   No. I ve never had any news of him,  Bernald heard himself repeating. He spoke in a low tone, and with the automatic utterance that alone made it possible to say the words. They were addressed to Miss Fosdick, into whose neighbourhood chance had thrown him at a dinner, a year or so later than their encounter at the Uplift Club. Hitherto he had successfully, and inten- tionally, avoided Miss Fosdick, not from any animosity toward that unconscious in- strument of fate, but from an intense re- luctance to pronounce the words which he knew he should have to speak if they met. Now, as it turned out, his chief surprise was that she should wait so long to make him speak them. All through the dinner she had swept him along on a rapid cur- rent of talk which showed no tendency to linger or turn back upon the past. At first he ascribed her reserve to a sense of deli- cacy with which he reproached himself for not having previously credited her; then he saw that she had been carried so far be- yond the point at which they had last faced each other, that it was by the merest hazard of associated ideas that she was now finally borne back to it. For it appeared that the very next evening, at Mrs. Beecher Bain s, a Hindu Mahatma was to lecture to the Uplift Club on the Limits of the Sublim- inal; and it was owing to no less a person than Howland Wade that this exceptional privilege had been obtained. The Legend 291  Of course Howland s known all over the world as the interpreter of Pellerinism, and the Aga Gautch, who had absolutely declined to speak anywhere in public, wrote to Isabella that he could not refuse any- thing that Mr. Wade asked. Did you know that Howland s lecture,  What Pellerinism Means,  has been translated into twenty- two languages, and gone into a fifth edition in Icelandic  Why, that reminds me,  Miss Fosdick broke off   I ve never heard what became of your queer friend what was his name   whom you and Bob Wade accused me of spiriting away after that very lecture. And I ve never seen you since you rushed into the house the next morning, and dragged me out of bed to know what I d done with him   With a sharp effort Bemald gathered himself together to have it out.  Well, what did you do with him   he retorted. She laughed her appreciation of his hu- mour.  Just what I told you, of course. I said good-bye to him on Isabella s door- step.  Bernald looked at her.   It s really true, then, that he didn t go home with you   She bantered back:   Have you sus- pected me, all this time, of hiding his re- mains in the cellar   And with a droop of her fine lids she added:   I wish he had come home with me, for he was rather in- teresting, and there were things I think I could have explained to him.  Bernald helped himself to a nectarine, and Miss Fosdick continued on a note of amused curiosity:  So you ve really never had any news of him since that night     No I ve never had any news of him.    Not the least little message       Not the least little message.    Or a rumour or report of any kind       Or a rumour or report of any kind.  Miss Fosdick s interest seemed to be re- vived by the strangeness of the case.   It s rather creepy, isn t it  What could have happened  You don t suppose he could have been waylaid and murdered   she asked with brightening eyes. Bernald shook his head serenely.  No. I m sure he s safe quite safe.    But if you re sure, you must know some- thing.   No. I know nothing,  he repeated. She scanned him incredulously.  But what s your theory for you must have a theory  What in the world can have be- come of him   Bemald returned her look and hesitated.  Do you happen to remember the last thing he said to you the very last, on the door-step, when he left you      The last thing   She poised her fork above the peach on her plate.   I don t think he said anything. Oh, yes when I reminded him that he d solemnly promised to come back with me and have a little talk he said he couldn t because he was going home.   Well, then, I suppose,  said Bernald,  he went home.  She glanced at him as if suspecting a trap.  Dear me, how flat  I always in- clined to a mysterious murder. But of course you know more of him than you say.  She began to cut her peach, but paused above a lifted bit to ask, with a renewal of animation in her expressive eyes:  By the way, had you heard that Howland Wade has been gradually gettinto farther and far- ther away from Pellerinism   It seems he s begun to feel that there s a Positivist ele- ment in it which is narrowing to any one who has gone at all deeply into the Wisdom of the East. He was intensely interesting about it the other day, and of course I do see what he feels. . . . Oh, it s too long to tell you now; but if you could manage to come in to tea some afternoon soon any day but Wednesday I should so like to explain-  COLOR ARRANGHMI:NTS OF FLOWERS By Helena Rutherfurd Kly 1 1 l.  s    ; ,     nNs IKiiM 1 111   I  ii ,K.

If a careful sketch or plan of the planting be made in advance, the work will be easier and the result more successful, as heterogeneous planting is often painful. Pink, blue, red, purple, and yellow flow- ers must be arranged to produce artistic effect. Larkspurs, for instance, are far more beautiful when grown in great masses of each shade, or with white Japanese Iris and Lilium Candidum, than in smaller clumps in a border where  many  other colored flowers are planted. Light blue Larkspur with the dark variety Formosum behind it, and yellow Coreopsis, Trolius, and pale yellow Calendula in the fore- ground, make an attractive planting. Early one July my first baby grandson was christened in our quaint little church in the country. Candidum lilies, with which I have at last, after much effort, been able to succeed, and Larkspur, both of which flowers are so exquisite in the garden, and so perishable when gathered that one should always cut them judiciously, were in their prime in wonderful quantity; and on this great day we were able to fill a large clothes-basket with the stalks of the lilies and branches of the pale blue Del- phinium Celestinium, and take them to make the little church beautiful, without missing any from the garden. Since there have been in my gardens her- baceous borders of only one or two colors, the arrangement has been simplified, and the effect more beautiful; and this plan is likely to be adhered to for some time to come. But an eagle eye must always be kept upon the borders to be sure that plants are not allowed to go to seed for the best gardeners often fail to realize that when seed-pods are forming the plants have no strength to blossom. The while border is my greatest delight; the flowers grown in it are exquisite atnight as well as in the daytime. At the back of the border are Bocconia Cordata, the Spiraeas Aruncus and Gigan- tea, and white Hollyhocks, which are fol- lowed in September by the mammoth Cosmos, which has been started under glass to insure its blooming before frost. Then there are Lilium Candidum, Lilium Auratum and Lilium Album which bloom successively, so that Lilies are blooming from June until frost. All these Lilies, if planted from fifteen to eighteen inches deep, seem to succeed far better than in shallower planting. Then there are quan- tities of the following: Hyacinthus Candicans, Physostegia Virginica Alba flowering fora month; Achillea, which gen- erously blooms the whole summer through; white Phlox, both early and late; white Lupins; Dictamus, Foxgloves, Lysiniachia Clethroides, Campanula Medium, some clumps of white Japanese Iris, and the old-time Valerian. For annuals there are Stocks, Sweet Sultan, the white Cornflower, Cyanea Alba, Empress Candy- tuft, Snapdragons, Asters and Gladioli. A pink border, or, indeed, an entire garden of pink flowers is not difficult of attainment. There are pink Hollyhocks and Cosmos, many shades of Phlox, Lilium Rubrum, Lilium Rubellum, and Lilium Magnificum, Pink Lupins, which are more beautiful than either the white or blue varieties, In- carvillia Delavayi, Sedum Spectabilis, and Canterbury bells, with some pink Colum- bines, Spiraea Elegans, and Dictamus for May blooming. Then there are the pink annual Larkspurs, Camellia-flowered Bal- sams, which in rich soil are wonderful plants, Phlox Drummondi which, if not allowed to seed, flowers all summer, Tu- berous-rooted Begonias, each plant of which is a mass of blossoms for three months; Verbenas glorified editions of the old-time Verbena which should be started under glass at the same time with the Cos- mos; and, if there is place for it, Gladioli, so necessary for bloom in September. The bine border is more unusual, and al- though I have visited many gardens in many countries, I have never yet seen another plantation of blue flowers only. These may be used with effect: Larkspur , Monkshood in early and late varie- ties, Veronica Grandiflora. Platyroydon, the Cam- panulas, varieties Persicifolia,Giomerata, Medium, and Pyramidalis, and the Lupins, arc six peren- nials which would alone keep a blue border pro- nounced in color for three months; but when you add Columbines, Eupatorium, Anchusa Italica, Baptista Australis, Scabiosa Caucasica, Blue Sal- via, Centaurea, the wonderful new blue Gladioli, large-flowering Argeratum and Lobelia, which are always in bloom, and the faithful Asters, which have, however, a violet tinge, the blue bor- der becomes a source of great interest.

M s garden at Meadosvhum is situated in the extreme northerly mmer of the hill country ol northern New  Jersey, on the New York State line. The ssinter temperature rises and falls from forty degrees above zero to ten and often tsveniy degrees below, and generally in summer there is a long period of dry weather. These conditions are espe- cially hard upon the liner Evergreen families. The great Hemlocks, the symmetrical Spruce, the si lemn Pine, ss hh h in a natural state so often grosvs near the ss iite Birches that one might say the Fines are married to the Birches, indeed, all Evergreens, inspire me ssith a feeling almost akin to worship, possibly a heathen trait svhieh lias survived generations of civilization, so that it is a great trial r.ot to be able to grow the Ever- green family successfully.

Steps of natural rough stone lead dosvn trom the summit of one "t the grassy banks into the little- gar- den. and around the three sides and in several formal beds set in turl are planted many varieties of small and rare Ever- greens. All are surrounded svith box edging, and had one nm seen a similar collection of Evergreens, it w ould not be possible to im- agine there could be- such sanets of form and shade, from darkest to lightest green, in, hilling die beautiful blue greens, golden vellosv. and green tipped svith yellosv. Ali iough natives of many countries, all the -pei imens have lived and thrived in the sandy soil and moist air of their new home by the sea. and both summer and ssinter the little Evergreen   larden is a joy to all svlio hehold it. The literature in all languages upon gar- dening. and the references in poetry and prose, both ancient and modern, to gardens, as cultivated, restful, romantic, and beauti- ful places, is infinite. In the Old Testa- ment many allusions are t   be found. We read of "The Garden of Nuts,   The Harden of Herbs,  and "The Garden of Cue umbers.  It is a fancy of many svomen to-day to have an herb garden, but the cucumber in the time of the prophet Isaiah, who speaks of a lodge in a garden of Cucumbers, and of Barm h, svlio says, " Like a scarecrow in a garden of Cucumber, svhieh keepeth nothing ass ay.  must have been a different vegetable from the one we nosv cultivate under that name.

Dale surveyed the room; the books alone were worth nn  re than his earthlv  m s sessions. Frmn a desk h mined a busl of Webster. Shadows seemed to leap from il; the sombre lips bespoke the futility of striv- ing against stern realities. There was gayety in the dining-room; Judge Long was a fountain of mirth, a fa- vorite at taverns, while riding the circuit  before juries wherever people gathered. A gale of laughter greeted his last anei - dote and the diners protested as he arose. Dale told his story excitedly, and at the conclusion Judge Long slowly brushed away the tobacco smoke.  I m sorry, John, but we did all we enuld last month and we failed; there s jusi one thing to do face the matter. It's hard, but this world is chiefly water and what isn t water is largely rock it s for lisli and fossils, I suppose.   But we will win this time " The old man s hand fell with decision.  Why do you say that     Mother had another dream last night."  But, you know, she had one a month ago,  quietly protested Long.  Yes and it came true we didn t do our part just right. We can t fail this time; there must be a day of justice    Well, as to that, John, this game of lile is strange; we bring nothing with us, so how can we lose  We take nothing away, so how can we win   We think; we plan; we stack these plans with precision, but Chance always sits at our right, waiting to i ui the cards. You speak of  justice.  It s a myth. The statue above the t ourt-lvuisc stands first on one foot, then on the other, tired of waiting, tired of the sharp rocks ol technicality, tired of the pompous f;.rce. Why, Dale,  he waved a hand toward an Vol. XLVII.  j2 opposite c  rn cr,  if old Daniel Webster w ere here lie   ouldn t do anything  " When an American lawyer   iies that mighty shade, it is com lusive, but the el fei t was lost or.

Is he in trouble   asked the young woman.   Yes, great trouble, and it isn t his fault. Fate is a poor shot. She never strikes one who is guilty without wounding two who are innocent.  Dale was an admirable volunteer and strangely resourceful; he had something more than courage. The train did not leave for two hours. He sat in the station till the clatter of the telegraph drove him out and he walked toward the yards with their colored lights, and through his brain raced Speculation s myriad fiends, all brandishing lanterns like those before him. When, at last, the train did start, it seemed to roll slowly, though it could suffer delay and reach the Capital by daybreak. He read the letter of introduction several times, and wondered what kind of man the President was; he thought of what he would say and how it would end. At intervals a ghost would extend a long, bony hand and wring drops of blood from his heart; at such times the President was heartless the trip very foolish he re- gretted his anger at Judge Long s house; and once, had the engine been a horse, he might have turned back. At other times gleams of victory came from somewhere and yet from nowhere, and routed the gyp- sies from his brain, and the President stood before him, a sympathetic gentleman. Once he knew it, and through excess of spirits walked up and down the aisle, studying the sleeping passengers; for John Dale trav- elled in a common  day coach.  At last he yielded to fatigue, and far off on the horizon of consciousness dimly flashed the duel of his hopes and fears. Rest was impossible, and after a long time the dawn drifted between his half-closed lids; a glorious dome floated out of the sky and the porter shouted,  All out for Washington   The cabmen who besieged the well- dressed passengers paid scant homage to the old man, who walked uncertainly out of the smoky shed and stood for a moment in Pennsylvania Avenue on one hand the Capitol, on the other the Treasury and White House. A great clock above him struck the hour of six; he hesitated, then went toward the scene of conflict. The waking traffic, the great buildings, the pulse of this strange life filled him with depression. He came to a beautiful park and gazed upon Lafayette and Rocham- beau,then the equestrian statue of Jackson. As he sat facing the snow-white building with columned portico, the magnolia blos- soms were as incense. When he could wait no longer he crossed to the President s office. A policeman stopped him at the steps. He explained that he had a letter from Judge Long. What  Did this policeman not know Judge Long  He sat under a tree, and the policeman walked a few paces away to turn anon and survey the waiting pilgrim. When the doors opened he entered. The President would not come for another hour; he would be busy possibly he might see him by noon provided he had credentials. With a sigh he sank into a chair and was soon asleep.   Come this is no cheap lodging house   The greeting was shaken into him by a clerk with hair parted in the middle, who disdainfully surveyed the sleeper s attire. He who has much on his mind little cares what he has on his back, and when the youth exploded,  Who are you   the old fellow s self-reliance came forth. Leading the way to the door Dale pointed a trembling finger, saying:   See that build- ing,  Bub  and that one yonder, and that patch over there with Andy Jackson in it   Well, I m one of the folks that made it all  and paid for it; and you re one of my hired hands. I ve got to keep so many of you down here I can t afford one on the farm. I want to see the President I ve business with him give him this letter  it s from Judge Sylvester Long, of Point Elizabeth   _ The youth vanished and Dale resumed his chair. He was looking across the lawn when a sudden alertness came into the scene; the silk-hatted line of callers stepped aside; those who were seated arose; newspaper correspondents turned with vigilant ears. A nervous voice inquired,   Wiiere is Mr. John Dale   The President stood before him, dressed Die Angel of Lonesome Mill 307 in white flannel, tlx-n smilingly grasped his hand with a blast of welcome:  I m de- lighted to meet the friend of Judge Long " 'I'aking his arm the Lxecutive escorted him through the Cabinet Room thronged wilh senators, representatives, and tourists.

A smile came over Dale s white face.

A member of the Russian Fm- bassy turned to his companion a dis- tinguished visitor from the Court of Si.

Dale listened; now it was an introduction and a message to an old friend in the West. Then a decisive  No   dashed some hope  -f pat- ronage; again, it was a discussion of poetry, aerial navigation, or the relics of the Aztec s. It was a long stride from " Lonesome Hill,  and for the time Dale was novelty s captiv e. He glanced round the room. It was not as fine as the directors  office of the Point Flizabeth Bank  Above the mantel the place of honor was the painting of a mar- tyr. He wondered w hether another stroke of the brush would have brought a smile to the face, or an expression of sadness. The hands were verv large   they had mice broken iron bands In one corner was a shot-gun; tennis rackets in another: on a   hair w ere snow- shoes and on the desk a sheaf of mses. Those whom the President had silted into his office from the crowd outside en- gaged in conversation. A Senator dis- cussed the ball game with a Supreme Court Justice; a General advised an Author t   try deep breathing. The President returned more animated than before. He placed a hand on Dale's shoulder: "Be comfortable and stay lor lunch; nobody but us.1  The crowd paid sudden respect to the homespun citizen cf an older day. and a great happiness came into his heart it was like the unfolding of one of the r  ses. Not that he was to lum h with tin' President, though his was the village estimate ol hu- man greatness. A vaster issue was before him, and this was a token ol success a sin cess w hieh would bind up his remaining veurs with peace-, and give- glorious rec om- peiiM- to the e ompanion of his lew joys and many griefs. The President hurriedly signed his name to pa re Imients.  I'm making ;i few postmasters.  He smiled toward the sofa. "It s no trouble here that's all at the otherend of the line." Without stopping the pen, he discussed matters with one statesman after another, his lips snapping with metallic positiveness. A member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations protested against the course pursued in San Domingo. " II" I were making a world. Senator, IM try to get along without putting in any San Domingos, but as things stand, we must make her be decent or let somebcM.lv else do it.  Another brings up the question of taxing incomes and inheritances.  1 favor them both," declared the l-.x- eeiitive. "They are taxes on good link, and bad luck is its ow n tax.

The President gazed intently as the old man wiped ihe windnw pane, nudded his head and turned tn lace the table. He cleared his thruat. then opened a llannel cnllar, already loose, and his eyes glistened.   Vnu re sii k   exclaimed the President rising.  Waiter sume brandy      Nn just a little dizzy.

I look her from her fnlks against their will, and I ve not panned out lucky but that s not to the puint. She's sick; the doctor can t help her nobody can but you I wish you might have seen her from the windnw ynnder.  The half-finished luncheun was disre- garded; the President had sunk into his i hair, and the keen discrimination of a king uf affairs was struggling with the strangest fascination he had ever known. " Lung ago, Mr. President, I had an enemy Bill Hartsell we shot each oilier.  He held up a withered hand. "It's been a feud ever since.

There was something m  st un- ii'iial Iniwevcr. in the radiant soul the splendid, aiuient youth of the i iiaint figure by his side. At the dour where the policeman had   ati bed the waiting pilgrim the President shook the old man s hand.

I MKT A JOYOUS ARIA I v Joseph Boarclinan, Jr. I MKT a jovo is Aria A-walking in the town, A huge, gray town that frowned on her A sombre, sullen frown. She had a hat of squirrel-gray A coat set jauntily. And all in girlish friendliness She turned to walk with me. I i ould not think w hat thing she was: She looked so slim and pure I guessed she might be some great queen In modest miniature. There was a velvet-silent room, A teapot set to sing, A lonk as lovelv as the snow    f applc-ldoom in spring. Some  lowers elm-wise in a vase, A beauty s'.rewn along W here her white hands were only then I knew she was a song. I heard what men would sing at dawn, I heard the surging sea. I wonder will she lie again The song she was to me.  :i if U VATf   I m. wkrf p.

The Casino gardens- Even agriculture, often monotonous in other lands, assumes in this favored region a comeliness in harmony with the picture, from the vine-draped lowlands to the chestnut forests in the higher valleys we cross, as our road surges up the mighty spurs of the Cevennes, on its way from the Rhone to the Atlantic water-shed. Local writers and poets have handed down a tradition, in their incomparable Provencal tongue, to account for the beauty of their land which has an original touch worthy the repeating. Wien in primeval times this globe of ours was taking shape, the idle gods of Olympus, always on the alert for some new amusement to help pass the lagging hours of eternity, took to modelling and decorat- ing its surface. A sort of artistic competition was inau- gurated as to who should achieve the best results with the material at hand; so they all set to work grouping mountains, tracing river courses, and curving coast-lines. Il is to this pleasant fad of the immortals that our globe owes all its scenery worthy of tha 3'S name. What they left untouched has simply remained tiresome and commonplace. So strongly did those deities stamp their per- sonality on their work that it is easy with a little practice to recognize the touch of the different gods, much as one gets to know a great painter s technique at a glance. Wherever Jupiter, that prehistoric Louis XIV, worked, nature assumed a pompous, artificial air. Cool and verdant, Normandy suggests the handiwork of Juno; while Vulcan went in for sinister effects mountain gorges and flaming volcanoes set in desolate wastes. It is the boast of the Provencal that the southern slopes of France owe their beauty to the caress of Venus's fair hands. That goddess must indeed have lin- gered with delight over her task, arranging and rearranging the curves of the rivers, moving the hills about, tinting the moun- tain streams and distant peaks until she had achieved the matchless ensemble we see to-day.   ii I ' nt n icklcn K kkI Charles   , w hile I  ;1111i11in tlie -.mitli nl Spain during his -ii.nm       11111,   11111      1 IlllC T1 i g 111 ill a sei I IK lei I little valle , tile ealin and I icaut      f w 11 i  11 -    i a   il i  a 11   1 11 n  vmnn warrior'- imaginai ion that during all t lie sin i eei linn veals o  -1   1   11  ii  I -in i c - am I -at ia lei I aniMliou, I he m  11o  r  i  1 I h,11   tiiet   oriier ol Amlalu-ia lontnnied in the great emperor's mind, until ImalK . nil ahlc longer to resist it- i all. lie pa  ed tin crown ami see  tre ol the world into ihe hands i 'f hi- s, in, and -larle.l with a r   111   ot a s  on i si led 1 oiirt ier- to end his lile in that Irani   vi i 1 vale.

Nowhere in l.urope, oerhaps in ihe The silent mountains as seen from Laxnalou. world, has the patient toil of man, seconded by soil and climate, achieved such a result. The straight white roads, over which the plane-trees arch with a cathedral coolness and shadow, lead through a region of in- tense and serried culture where no square foot of earth is allowed to lie idle. The whole landscape simmering under the mid-day sun pays tribute to the intelli- gence and industry of the little French peasant and his spouse. Rich in Gothic and Romanesque art as Bordeaux is, its splendid eighteenth-cen- tury architecture, the real attraction of the place, makes this city one of the most inter- esting in France, for Mansard, Louis, and the two Gabriels are here seen at their best. The stately, long-drawn river front, the two exquisite squares opening from it, so like the Place Vendome and yet so superior to it in freedom of treatment, would alone mark any town with a red letter. But Bordeaux has even better than all this to offer, for she possesses perhaps the most perfect theatre in existence, the chef d ceuvre of Louis, which, since its construc- tion under Louis XVI, has remained the model of buildings of its class, and fur- nished Gamier with the leading features of his Paris Opera House. It has been decided to make the last leg of our rambling journey by boat. So, one exhilarating July morning, with a smell of salt in the air, we board the little river steamer that runs dailv to Rovan and the sea. This, he it said in passing, is an- other lorm of travel too much neglected. It is doubtful if one in every thousand of our compatriots who vearlv scurry along the beaten tracks of Europe, have even heard of the sail from Havre up the Seine to Rouen, or that still more wonderful excursion down the historic Rhone from Lyons toAvignon. The trip from Bordeaux to Rovan compares favorably with either of these. Leaving the clipped trees and rostral col- umns of the Bordeaux quay and its pictu- resque brick bridge to our left, we make our way quickly, for the tide is with us, across the crowded roadstead. Low wooded hills appear on either hand and then recede, as we cross the wide ex- panse of the Gironde estuary on our way to Soulac, where a first stop is made, appar- ently that some chickens and vegetables may be brought on board, amid a clatter and confusion worthy of an embarking armv t1  r  is. During the next hour we skirt the long, sandy Modoc peninsula. King between the Gironde and the Atlantic  Medio Aqu;c , perhaps the most remarkable bit ot territory on the continent.

REST HARROW A COMEDY OF RESOLUTION BY MAURICE HEWLETT Illustration uy Frank Chau; HOOK II    Continued  V HEN, after dinner, Mrs. Devereux had told her young friend that she was uncom- fortable, there had been no need of the words; but the slow answering  I know  with which Mrs. Wilmot expressed sym- pathy was not intended to imply that she shared the feeling. She herself was not at all uncomfortable, because, while she saw the whole state of affairs, she was not un- hopeful of coping with it. Touching the place where the tender point of her breast lav nestling, she assured herself that she could hope. But Mrs. Devereux, moving about in worlds not realized, was incensed. Nothing that followed during the next few days served to clear the surcharged air. It is hard to say what vexed her most, where all was as it should not be. Ingram, bluntly unconscious of her sufferings, gloomed over his own; Chevenix spied about for what he could not find, spy as he would, and made the cause of woe more conspicuous than ever. As for her, the disastrous fair, the de- liberation with which she went about her duties, and ease with which she did or caused them to be done; her Self-possession, gentleness, suavity, yes  and benevolence, were sights to make angels weep. Tears of Blood  If Mrs. Devereux, by any means, could have compassed tears of blood, they had been shed. Nothing less vivid would have met the case: to exhibit her scarlet handkerchief to Ingram with a.  There, see, I weep. Tears of Blood   Day by day in that mild spring weather, under pale blue skies, fanned by zephyrs, she could but pace the terrace walks, and stiffen herself, and stare about her with dull disapproval for the very flowers, lest theirs, too, should be frail beauty, anti repeat for her only com- fort that she was most uncomfortable. So she was. But it was because she did not understand, not because she did. Curi- osity ravaged her. On one of these days, breakfast over at half-past ten, young Mr. Chevenix declared his intention with cheerfulness and point.   Twentieth of April Dizzy s birthday, or Shakespeare s. Nevile, I'm going to fish your river. They are leaping like the boys in   Eugene Aram,  and I'm going to give them something to leap at. Now, what are all you people going to do  Because, I ll lie free with you, I don t want you to come and look on. Mrs. Devereux, I let you off. You needn t gillie me. Nevile, you run away and play. Amuse Mrs. Wilmot. Do now: she likes it. I m all right.  The elder lady fixed him keenly with a look which saw through his saucy assur- ance; Ingram's eyes sought those of Mrs. Wilmot across the table. She lent him their wonder for a moment, then looked down at her bosom. He was satisfied. There were sdll women in the world.  What shall we do   he asked her.  Will you be driven  Will you drive  Will you ride   Another shaft rewarded him, which said,   Do with me as you will.  Ingram rang the bell. Minnie appeared.  Tell Frodsham, the horses at a quarter- past eleven. I ride Sea-King, Mrs. Wil- mot Loma Doone. He had better come  or Butters will do. That s all.  Mrs. Devereux had been ignored, but was not displeased. It showed, at least, that Ingram knew she was not to be dis- posed of like a white rabbit. It was, how- ever, necessary to say something, to declare one s presence, as it were; so she collected her papers.   I have letters to write. You will excuse me, I know.  Chevenix sprang to the door.   By George, I should think so,  he said, which 323 Drawn by Frank Craig. Had he had eloquence, he thought, as he watched her, he had won. Cut he was anxious. She was such a deep one. Page 333. Rest Harrow 325 was well intended, but too brisk. He bowed her out, shut her out, and stood with his eyes on the others. Ingram remained before the fire, looking out of window.   She s in a wax. I don t know why.    Oh, don t you, my boy     said Chevenix to himself. Mrs. Wilmot trifled with a tea-spoon.  And I don t care much,  he added. Mrs. Wilmot smiled. Mr. Chevenix, going a-fishingT saw, as he had intended to see, Sanchia in the rose garden, talking to Struan Glyde, who was tying ramblers.  Morning, Sanchia  morning, Glyde I  Each greeted him, but the youth grimly. He talked at large.   I m for murder. I must flesh my steel. It s too good a day to lose. Clouds scurry, sun is shy; air s balmy: a trout must die. That is very nearly poetry, Sancie. It is as near poetry as I can hope to get this side the harps and quires. Now, what on earth is Glyde doing to his roses at this time of year     The dark-skinned, sharp-chinned young man, aproned and shirt-sleeved, turned a shade darker. His black eyes glowed. He was quietly arrogant, even to her.  It doesn t matter,  he had once told her,   what you say or do. I love you, and that s the sum and end of it.  Now he allowed her to answer for him.  There was a wind in the night, which tore them about. I asked him to make them safe. I hate to think of their bruised ribs.  Chevenix whistled his satisfaction with this and all things else.   I see. Works of mercy. There s a blessing on that, some- where and somewhen. All to the good, you know, Glyde. You never know your luck, they tell me.  He left Glyde and his roses, and turned to the young lady.   Well now, look here, Sancie if works of mercy are toward, what d you say to one on your own account  Here I stand, an orphan boy, upon my honor. The master s gone riding with the widow.  He stopped his rattle, as a thought struck him serious for a moment.   By George, and he s a widower so he is    Discharged of that, he resumed.  Yes, and Mrs. Devereux has got the hump, as they say, and here I am at your mercy, to be made much of. Who s going to admire me   Vol. XLVII. 34 Who s going to hold my net  Who s going to say,  Oh, what a beauty    He had now got her thoroughly at her old ease with him. Her eyes gleamed, and there was no doubting hc-r smile.  Now, I ll tell you what. Your roses are all right. Glyde will see to that. You leave that to Glyde and his strong right arm. His strength is as the strength of ten because . . . you follow me, I think  Now, Sancie, I put it to you  I m an old friend of the family, and haven t seen you for how many years  Aren t you going to give me half an hour of your morning     He pleaded by looks. He was quizzical, but in earnest. Her brow was clear.  Yes,  she said.  I ll come for half an hour.    Right  Right, Goddess of the silver brake. Coir" , hold the pass with me.  He turned to gr. and she caught him up.  T mix my poets like salad, but that s because I m in such high spirits. By Jove, Sancie, it is good to see you again.  She met his laughing eyes with hers. She swam by his side took his net, and was happy. Her face glowed. She had the power of casting troubles bellind, recuperative power, resili- ency. Glyde, the olive-faced, watched them down the walk, and owned to a heart of lead.  As well shut down the west wind as a spirit like hers   He turned to his affair. Below the steps, in the nut-walk which led to the bridge, Chevenix altered his tone.   It s good of you to come with me, Sancie, my dear. I m a very friendly beggar, and Nevile, you know Isay   and he turned her a sober face   Youdo know, I suppose   His wife eh   Dead, you know. Oh, but of course you did     She met him unfalteringly.  Yes, he told me.  Chevenix shrugged.   I must say, you know what  Oh, of course, it was a ghastly affair all along. But you know all that as well as I do. Why, her temper  Oh, awful  I ve seen her, myself, dead- white in one of her rages she had hold of a wine-glass so hard that it snapped, and cut her hand. She looked at the blood she didn t know how it happened. And he  well, you ought to know was as bad, in his way. Ton my soul, Sancie, Vesuvius might just as well have married Etna every bit. But there  What s the good of talking  326 Rest Harrow Everybody knew how it would be.  Words failing him, he stared about him.   But still oh, damn it all  To hear of your wife s death casually on a platform  from a chap you happen to know hap- pen to have met somewhere oh, well, I call it casual. That s the word, I believe   casual. Well, it is pretty casual what  Now just tell me what you think between friends, of course.  She stopped him; she was short in the breath.   I think not. If you don t mind.  He became as serious, immediately, as he was capable of being.   I ll do as you like, my dear but you ll let me say this, that if I could see you with all your belongings about you again, I should sing a hymn. That s all, Sancie; but it nieans a lot. When you went out of Great Cumberland Place, it be- came, somehow, another kind of place. I hardly ever go there now, you know. And now they re all married but you, and I say, you heard that Vicky had a son and heir  Did you hear that   She had averted her face, but she listened intensely, nodding her head.   Yes, yes, I knew that. Papa told me. He always writes to me, you know, from the office, poor darling   She appealed to him urgently.   Please don t talk about them just yet. Please don t.  He saw the mist in her eyes, and was afraid.  All right, Sancie, all right. I m frightfully sorry. Beastly painful, all this, you know.  He was much disturbed. To his simple soul a fine day, a fine-fettled river, demanded, as of right, a happy mood in man, for whom all things were made. And a fine girl by his side, a good, a brave, a splendid girl down on her luck on such a day  What could one do   If, when you began, she choked you off  Wouldn t meet you half-way bottled it up  And here he was, geared for fishing, and without the heart to wet a line, because of all this misery. Sanchia, sharply in profile to him, from cheek to chin, from shoulder to low breast, all one sinuous, lax, beautiful line, broke in on his rueful meditations.   There s a rise,  she said.   Look, look.  His eye swept the river.   You re right. By Gad, that s a whacker. That s a fish. Now, you stop just where you are, net in hand. Don t move, and you shall see something.  He left her, and ran stooping down the bank, all his little soul concentrated in his cast. The dimpled water ran and swirled, the line flashed in the sun. Three casts, four; a splash, a taut line, and his shout,  Come on, quick; I ve got him.  Sanchia glided swiftly down the bank, her eyes alight, the lines of neck and shoulder finely alert. Her eyes shone, her lips parted; she looked the Divine Huntress, to whom Sen- house had once likened her. She stooped, the net jerked; she watched, waited, tense to the act. Within the swirling water the great fish plunged; she watched, strung to the pounce; the net dipped and darted; she lifted it to land. Chevenix admired.   By George, you are a one-er, I must say  Bom to it. You dip like an osprey. That s a fish what    They peered together into the net, where, coiled and massy, beaming rose and pale- gold, the trout writhed.   Splendid    breathed Sanchia, glowing and alight. Chevenix gloried in her beauty.   If Nevile don t know what his chances are  if he ain t on his knees my Heavens, what a mate for a chap    A shadow falling upon him caused him to look up. Mrs. Devereux, gray and tall, boa d, gloved, umbrella d, stood regarding him and his companion from the bank. In- stinct prompted him immediately to screen Sanchia by dragging her into the party. He held up the net, and plunged.   First prize,  he cried out, as heartfully as he could,  to me, and Miss Percival.   So I see,  said Mrs. Devereux.  Ah, good-morning.  This was to Sanchia s bland greeting, which, as always, made the lady shiver. It is difficult to say what a shock it was to her to be greeted cheerfully by Sanchia. And to see one in so painful a situation occupied  , by anything less painful, interested in any- thing at all, was truly shocking. Mrs. Dev- ereux s idea of irregularity was that it ab- sorbed the devoted victim, kept her aghast. If it did not, surely there was no reward left to the virtuous. But here we had a highly irregular young woman behaving with extreme regularity. Was the world turning upside down  Was black, then, really white  She shivered, she blinked her eyes; but she descended the bank and stood beside the pair, yet rigidly apart. Chevenix, having got her there, knew not Rest Harrow what to do with lu-r. It seemed to liim that lie had better, on the win le,      i 1, -;    turned the lady a knowing fat e.  'This is not the first time bv anv means tliat Miss l ercival and I have gone fishing, you must know. We began by ti  kling 'em  we were un hins together, you see."

I.ven Mrs. Deve- rcux felt an emotion from the beam with which Sam hia rewarded him  a lender, compassionate look, as il she understood and excused him.  You are old friends. I see," she said; and her smile was not unfriendly. Chcvenix shook his head wisely." I right- 1 nilv old I've known  em all all my lite." Mrs. Devereux then made a distinct ad- vance.  It must be very nice for you," she said to Sancliia. Sane Ilia s eves were now clear, and her smile absolutely general. "To see Mr. Chcvenix  Yes, indeed." She codec led herself. "But I'm afraid I must go now. I ve a great deal to do." She admonished the voting man.  Now you had belter   ale h some more," she told him. "I must ge i."

I can t explain it but I think you see it in her face, you know and man- ner. Yes, in her manner. She s uncom- mon, you see, most uncommon. And as cool as well, it would be hard to say how cool a hand 1 thought her.  He paused, having got off this effective estimate,round- eyed and triumphant.   It seems to me, Mr. Chevenix,  said the dry lady,   that the less you say the better.   Not at all, Mrs. Devereux, not at all.  He was eager to explain.   I don't think you quite follow me. What I meant to say was that when a young woman can be as cool as she can be; can run a big place like this, and manage a staff of servants out- doors, mind you, and in; no steward, only a bailiff; keep all the accounts; and hold her head up for she does that, you know, uncommonly well why, then I say that she must be allowed the benefit of the doubt, you know. You must say,   Well, it s rum, it s rummy,  or how you like to put it   but she s got a head on her shoulders, and I sup- pose she knows what she s doing. I sup- pose she s seen her way.  For she s all right, you know, Mrs. Devereux; she s as right as rain. It s irregular, dashed irregu- lar but, by George, I ll tell you this, Nevile was in a bad way when he first met her, and she s pulled him through. He s steady enough now, is Nevile. Don t drink- nor do other things. He threatened to be a waster in his day; but he s no waster now. She did that, you know; she pulled him through. Why, bless your heart, Mrs.Dev- ereux, he used to rave about her rave, and chuck himself about on sofas, and cry like anything, and bite his nails down. There never was such a girl under heaven, he used to say. He called her a goddess. Love  Oh, Lord  And I assure you, on my solemn oath, that he never did a better day s work in his life, nor any girl a finer, than when he put in his word for himself, poor devil, and she said,  Yes, I ll do it.

She went on as if she did; but now no, I don t know. You see, she s such a cool hand, she s such a deep one you can't tell. There s no telling with that sort. All I can say is, it looked uncommonly like the real thing. We all thought so at the time. The symptoms were right enough or wrong enough, you ll say and then, look at her since  She s stuck to him through everything good report, bad report, every- thing. She s chucked her people or been chucked. Had four beautiful sisters glow- ing, upstanding, fine girls, all c f them; and chucked. Old father, in the city: chucked. Mother, big, handsome, hot-tempered: chucked. And all for Nevile, who  be- tween ourselves  ain t worth it. He s not a bad one, but he s not a good one, either. He s got a cruel temper, Nevile has like that ghastly wife of his. But   he cried, opening his arms   there you are. They re like that, her sort. Mighty quiet about it, you know; was turned into the streets, you may say; father, mother, sisters, all showed their backs. What does she do  Sets her teeth together, looks straight ahead, and takes old Nevile. And here she is now  oh, as right as rain. What a girl, eh   Mrs. Devereux was certainly moved. She was almost prepared to admit a genuinely exceptional case. But she had a question to ask. Did Ingram intend to marry her   now  At this Chevenix stepped back, as if to avoid a blow.  Ah   he said.  Ah  That s it. Ask me another.    Do you mean to say of your friend, and mine,  she pursued him,   that he would dare after all that you tell me to-   No,  said Chevenix, in a desperate stew,   no, I don t mean that. I think he would have her this moment if he could get her. But the fact is well, you know   and he glanced anxiously at the lady,  I ve nothing to go upon, absolutely nothing as yet; but the fact is, I m not sure whether she would take him, you know- now."   Is that possible     was all the lady could find to say, with a throw-up of the hands.   Is that possible    Quite with Sanchia,  said Chevenix.  Through with him, you know got to the bottom of him sick of him. I believe he bores her, you know.  Mrs. Devereux looked at him, more in sorrow than in anger, and walked slowly away.

No wheed- ling of Mrs. Wilmot's could draw anv fur- ther comment from her, and she said nothing to Ingram either fur nr against w hat she supposed now to lie the desire, the honor- able desire, ol his heart.   hldlv enough, though it was against all her upbringing, Chevenix had so far succeeded in impress- ing her that she rather respected Sanchia the more lor being cool now that rehabilita- tion was in full sight, anil prai tieallv within touch of her hand.

That she could not do. She found herself waiting about in   orridors and halls for Sanchia s possible passage.    nce she had marked her down in the garden, llower- basket on arm, scissors in hand. She- had been tluttered, positively felt her heart- beats, as she sailed down in pursuit; but then Sanchia, under the brim of her garden hat, must have divined her, lor, with j few clear words of dire  lion over her shoulder to the young gardener who was helping her, she had steered smoothly away and, w ith- out running, could not have been caught. The thing was marked, not uncivilly, but quite clearly. What could one do.-' Two more days of fine weather and per- plexity, and she announced her departure as imminent. We were at Thursday. She must positively leave on Monday.  No more letters to write about my shortcom- ings,  was Ingram's comment upon this in- telligence, to Mrs. Wilmot apart.

Mrs. Wilmot, who had no general con- versation, thought that  hey ought to be  nii e   to M rs.

But the w orst of Mrs. Dev - ereux, he went on to sav, was that she could n't be ha  ipv unless she did disapprove of somebody.

At luncheon Ingram proposed a visit to   e rl a i n Sowerbvs of Sowcrbv, and point- edlv asked Mrs. Devereux t   come.  You like her, vou know. It's beyond dispute. So 1 do hope you'll come.

He ought to wait for his beard to grow; then you might listen to him.  Glyde, who was dumb in company, was hacking into the clods, while Chevenix, to whom he was a negligible, pursued his own affair.   I say, Sancie, I m going to ask a favor of you not the first, by any means; but I always was a sturdy beggar. The Lord loveth a sturdy beggar, eh  Well, look here, I m at a loose end again. Nevile s taken  em out driving to a tea-party to the Sowerbys . I jibbed, though I was asked, I lied, because they drove me into a comer. I couldn t face old Sowerby s chin and all those gels with their embroi- dered curates what  You know what I mean. I mean their church-work, and the curates they do it for. So I said I was going fishing which was a lie and Mrs. Dev- ereux as good as said it was a lie. Now, suppose you invite me to tea; how would that be    Then you do go fishing,  said Sanchia, and smiled.  Very well. I do invite you.   Bravo  You re a true friend.

Many thanks. What s your hour    Half-past four,  she told him. He bowed, and left her with Glyde. He turned to look at them as he left the walled gar- den, and saw them near together Glyde vehement in his still way of undertones, she listening as she worked. At half-past four she received him in her room. Though her blouse was of lace and her skirt of green cloth, she looked like a virgin of the Athenian procession. Her clothes flowed about her, clung to her like weed as she swam. For once in her life she wore an ornament a long string of pale- amber drops was round her neck, and fell below her waist. As he met her friendly, silent welcome, he expressed her to himself   By the gods above, you are without exception the healthiest finest bravest  young woman that ever made the sun shine in gray weather.  Aloud, he made things easy.  Here s your tea-party, Sancie, dressed in its best, eager for the fray.

Met her in Bond Street. Sinclair d got the pip, or something, down at Aldershot. Ex- pensive complaint, seemingly. So she d come up to see a palmist, or some kind of a specialist, about him. She spoke of you, of her own accord. I said I was coming down here.  Sanchia s band at the kettle was steady, but her eyes flickered before they took the veil.  Tell me about Vicky. What did she say of me   Chevenix came to the tea-table and stood by her.   I think Vicky s all right. I do indeed. It seems to me she d give her ears to see you simple ears.

She s more than county to you. There s Melusine, there s Philippa, there s Hawise; there s your good old dad, there s your lady mother. You get  em all. And Nevile s biting his nails for it. And a free man. Come now,  She had listened, that s certain; she had- n t been displeased. He had seen her eyes grow dreamy, he had marked her rising breast. Rising and falling, rising and fall- ing, like lilies swayed by flowing water. That betokened no storm, nor flood; that meant the stirring of the still deeps, not by violent access, but by slow-moving, slow- gathered, inborn forces. Had he had elo- quence, he thought, as he watched her, he had won. But he was anxious. She was such a deep one. When she spoke there sounded to be a tinge of weariness in her voice; she dragged her sentences, as if she foresaw her own acts, and was tired in advance. She seemed almost to be pitying her fate. At first she looked down at her hands in her lap, at her lingers idly interweaving; but midway of her drawn-out soliloquy for she seemed to be talking to herself she turned him her eyes, and he plumbed their depths in vain.  It s very nice of you to be interested in me. You are much more interested than I am and it s a compliment, a great com- pliment. I think you are very loyal if I can call it loyalty if you ll let me call it that. I like my work here; I m perfectly happy doing it. It was hard at first. I knew absolutely nothing of housekeeping, and managing things, when I came here. I had to work to learn bookkeeping and ac- counts cooking building   carpentering  stock-raising oh, everything. I had to feel that I knew very nearly as much about everything as the people who were to do what I told them. And of course that was quite true; but it wasn t at all easy. It has taken me eight years to get as far as I am now. And I could go on for years more. There s nobody on the place whom I can t manage; they all like me. I m quite com- fortable if I carube let alone.  Speaking so, she believed it. But, think- ing it over, she was driven to explain herself.  People seem to think that girls that women care for nothing but one thing  being married, I mean. I m sure that s a mistake. One gets interested, one may get absorbed and then there s a difficulty. For it s very true, I think, that unless we care for the one thing, and that thing only, we don t care for it at all. At least, that is how I feel about it. I have got lots of in- terests in life all these things here man- agement of things. I don t want Nevile - or to be married. I don t want anything of the sort; I can t be bothered. I cared once frightfully, but now I don t care. All that was long ago, at the beginning  eight years ago. Now it s done with. I only want to be left alone to do my work here. It doesn t seem to me much to ask; but-  It was then that she looked at him, and was beyond the power of his sounding. She grew vehement, full of still, passionless rage. She was like a goddess pronouncing a de- cree; she was final.   I don t want to marry Nevile. It bores me. And he doesn t want me, really. He thinks he does, because he thinks that he can t have me any other way. But he would be miserable, and so should I. It seems to me impossible. You can t put life into dead things. When he came back here the other day he had been away a year: a year and ten days. He had written to me twice-  Chevenix interrupted.  Excuse me,  he said.  How many times had you written to him     He had guessed at pique, but he was wrong. She replied slowly.  I forwarded his letters. I hadn t written at all.  Her sim- plicity  Chevenix allowed her to go on.   The thing all that it began with was over. I felt that. I showed him that, the first evening he was here. He has never spoken to me again of that sort of thing, and I don t think he ever will. He doesn t understand being refused anything. I sup- pose he never has been before in his life.   Weren t you, perhaps, a little bit short   he hazarded; and she considered the possibility.   No. I don t think so. I wasn t more abrupt than he was after a year.  She paused.  He threw out her death Mrs. Ingram s death  she forced herself to the name   quite casually, as if he had been saying,   By the by, the rector s coming to dine.  If he had wanted me, do you think he would have put it like that   334 Rest Harrow  Nevile,  said Chevenix,  would put anything like anything. He s that sort, you know. He d take for granted that you understood lots of things which he couldn t express. But I will say this for Nevile. He s not petty. He s fairly large-minded. For instance, I ll bet you what you like he didn t mind your not writing to him or re- proach you with it.  She opened her eyes.   Of course he didn t. He was perfectly happy. He told me he had been idiotically happy. He knew I was here, because I forwarded his mails and that was all he cared about. I was here for when be chose. I assure you, he didn t want me at all, until I showed him that he couldn t have me.   But he did, you know,  said Chevenix;   he does. He was sure of you all through, from the beginning, as you say. That s why he didn t write, or expect letters from you. He flattered himself that he was se- cure. Poor old Nevile    He felt sorry now for Ingram. She was really adamantine. She arose, with matches in her hand, knelt before the fire and kindled it. She blew into it with her mouth, and watched the climbing flames.   I. don t think you need pity Nevile, really,  she said.  He will always be happy. But I am goi g to be n ade unhappy.  She proclaimed her fate a a fact in which she had no concern at all.' Chevenix rose and paced the room.   Well, you know I must be allowed to say your happiness is so entirely in your own hands. It s difficult. I ve no right to suggest to interfere in any way. I m nothing at all, of course-   You are my friend, I hope,  she said, watching the young fire still on her knees before it, worshipping it, as it seemed. Chevenix expanded his chest.   You make me very proud. I thank you for that. Yes, I am your friend. That s why I risk your friendship by asking you something. Youwon tanswermeun less you choose, of course. But come now, Sancie, is there, might there be somebody else    She looked round at him from where she knelt. Her hands were opened to the fire, her face was warmed by its glow; it was the pure face of a seraph.  No. There s no- body at all now.  He was again standing before the little photograph of the nymph thigh-deep in water. That seemed to attract him; but he heard her  now,  and started.  I take your word for it, absolutely. But, seeing what you felt for Nevile, in the beginning, I should have thought in any ordinary case there must have been a tender spot  unless, of course, you had changed your mind for reasons---  She got up from her knees, and stood, leaning by the mantel-piece. Her low voice stirred him strangely.  There are reasons. The spot, as you call it, is so tender, that it s raw.  uGood Lord,  said Chevenix.  What do you mean   She was full of her reasons, evidently. Rumors of them, so to say, drove over her eyes, showed cloudily and angrily there. Her beautiful mouth looked cruel as if she saw death and took joy in it.   I think he is horrible,  she said.   I think he is like a beast. He doesn t love me at all until he comes here and then he expects me Oh, don t ask me to talk about it.  She stopped her tongue, but not her thought. That thronged the gates of her lips. She hesi- tated, fighting the entry; but the wojds came, shocked and dreadful.  He wants me, to mangle me like a beast.  Chevenix began to stammer.   Oh, I say, you mustn t Oh, don t talk like that-  The door opened, and Ingram came in. He looked from one to the other, sharply.   Hulloa,  he said.   What are you two about in here   Sanchia looked at the fire, and put her foot close to it, to be warmed.  Tea- party,  said Chevenix.   That s it, Nevile.  He nodded sagely at his host, and saw his brow clear. Ingram shut the door and came into the room, to a chair.  That s all right,  he said.   I hope it was a live- lier one than mine. That old Devereux was on her high-stepper. I m sick of being trampled. I thought, though, that you had been having words. You looked like it.  Sanchia said, smiling in her queer way,   Oh, dear, no. Mr. Chevenix is much too kind for that. He s been talking veTy nicely to me. He s been charming.   Oh, come, Sancie   cried the brisk young man, quite recovered. Ingram, in a stare, said,  Yes, Sancie, you may trust him. He s a friend of ours.   I do trust him,  she said. Chevenix said,   I shall go out on that. I declare my innings. Good-by, you two.

VII Tnc.ram, at supper in his private room, had his elbows on the table, and spoke be- tween his lists to Chevenix, let into these mysteries for the first time. " I ought not to complain, you'll say, and in my heart of hearts 1 don t, because I'm a reasonable man, and know that you don't make a row about sunstroke or lightning- sliocks.

Ingram frowned, and waxing in rage, stared at his friend as il lie had never known him. "You don t know what ym re talk- ing about. W liv. she adored me. I was never more in Invo with a woman in my lilc than I was with Sam ie." Chevenix tilted bail, his t hair. "   Mi. you had it preltv badlv at the time.

All this Ingram took as his due as due, that is. to a man of passimi and reasonable desires. He fell intn a reverie.   es, yes, I know. She was devilish fund nf me." Chevenix gritted his teeth, but Ingram went on. " 11 was a false position. I know, and I never ought In have Innked at her twice. But she was awfully queer or aw - lullv deep one never knew w hich.

" Pet's h:ive cards on the table. I told Yii kv all about it at a dance  and Yit kv told her." " I tnld her." Ingram said, " that I was in love with her. and promised to behav e and so I should have, only-  "    nly vnu didn't, nld t hap.  "She loved me there was nn stopping it then. The thing was done. Mind ynu, her people knew it all, too." 330 Rest Harrow  The mother always was a fool,  Chev- enix agreed.   And she liked you.    I know she did. I took care of that.   Not a bit of it, my boy,  the other ob- jected.  That s just what you didn't do. She liked you because she thought you didn t care a curse whether she liked you or not.  Ingram raised his eyebrows at such naivete.  That s what I mean, of course. So it went on all that summer. We used to shake when we met each other, and be speechless. By Heavens, what a time that was  Do you remember the tea-party   Chevenix blinked.   I wasn t there; but I remember what happened afterwards. The poor child as white as a sheet and every hand lifted against her. By God, Nevile, what girls mere chits will go through     I know,  said Ingram dreamily.   Isn t it awful   Chevenix looked at him. He was quite serious. What can you do with such a man as this   They left us alone in the room, you know,  Ingram continued.   Vicky went out last and left us in there and the whole place was charged with electricity. You could feel it, smell it, hear it crackling all about. My heart going like a drum; my ears buzzing with it all. I hadn t been able to speak when they spoke to me. I don t know what the devil they must have thought of me and I didn t care a damn. And over across the tea-table, on a low chair  there she sat my girl  Her eyes down- cast, her mouth adroop.  He shut his eyes for a moment.   And Vicky went out, and left us there    You had it badly, old chap,  Chevenix said.  Go slow. Take your time. Or chuck it, if you d rather.  Ingram appeared not to hear him; he was staring at the table-cloth, at his two hands locked in front of him, and at his knuckles white under the strain.   I don t know how long I stood gaping at the window, I don t, indeed. I could feel her sitting shaking in her chair; but neither of us said anything. Somebody came to take the tea out and then I turned and looked at her; and she turned and looked at me. Something drew me set me on the move. It was all over with me then. I went straight across the room to her; I stood above her, I stooped and took her hands. I don t know what I said; she looked at me all the time, in a strange, clear way. She got up I was beside her, and took her. Not a word said. I had her lips: honey of flowers  Her soul came forth from'them: new wine. Oh, God  I thought so, anyhow. And so did she, Chevenix. She meant giving.  Chevenix nodded shortly. He believed that. Ingram had covered his eyes. He drained a glass before he went on with his account.   I suppose you know the rest as well as I do. I never had the details out of her. One of them that Mrs. King  Philippa, it was came slam into the room; and what was there to do  I stuck it as long as I could until I was practically kicked out. The mother came back and turned me out. I had to leave her to brave them all and I never saw her again until I found out where she was in London.    Don t you trouble to tell me all that part,  said Chevenix, frowning at him.   I know more about that than you do. I was in it. My head, how they treated her  What I never did understand, you know, was how you found out where she was.  Ingram smiled. His memories now amused him. He looked straight at his friend.   I ll tell you that. It was rather neat. You remember that chap Senhouse - loafing kind of artist, anarchist, gypsy- looking chap, who wore no hat   Chevenix opened his eyes.   By George, I do   Ingram nodded.  She thought no end of him. He took her affair with me very much to heart.    As well he might,  said Chevenix.   I fancy that you were the only person who took it easy.    Sancie used to tell him everything,  In- gram went on,  and she told him all the trouble. She d been turned adrift with fifty pounds to her name-    Not quite so bad as that,  Chevenix put in.   They locked her up with an aunt, and she bolted.    Same thing,  said Ingram.   Well, this chap Senhouse comes here one day in a mighty hurry turns up at breakfast, and makes a row. Wants me to swear I ll divorce, and marry Sancie. Says he thinks I m a blackguard and all that, but that, on the whole, I d better marry her. Refuses to give me her address, all the same.

She never showed off well, and was always silent in company. Oh, but what a girl  " W hen she saw me, she Hushed all over, and stood. She stood on the last step, and looked at me.

I was but fourteen years of age when I made this memorable journey from Manchester, my native city, but the experience was destined never to be forgotten, and I recall its slightest detail as if it had been an event of yesterday. I had been brought up steeped, so to speak in an atmosphere of music which had already determined my career. My fa- ther, who had been a pupil of Hummel and Kalkbrenner, was an organist and pianist of merit. He was also an excellent violinist, and always played at the   Gentlemen's Concerts  in Manchester, a picked orches- tra of sixty or seventy men. To these con- certs I was always taken and was allowed to be on the stage near my father, whose chair I occupied while he was playing. The Eng- lish orchestral players  except, of course, the  cellos  always stood while they played; they were not allowed the privilege of sit- ting and crossing their legs in the listless man- ner which so often offends the eye in our modem performances. I was taken to these concerts from the time I was .six years old, and I am told that I often fell asleep during a symphony, and that my father occupied his  rests  in prodding me with his bow. But at fourteen I was very wide awake on all musical matters, and when one of my father s friends, who was a musical critic on one of the Manchester papers, offered to pay my expenses to Birmingham if I would write him an account of the festival, I agreed at once. Indeed, for such a reward I would have engaged to write an epic had he so demanded, for I was at the age when nothing seemed impossible. Had I not just composed a sacred cantata on  The Raising of Lazarus,  doomed, it is true, for various reasons, not the least of which was the opening recitative, beginning thus:  Now a certain man was sick.  Whether the reiteration of this phrase offended the popular English prejudice against the word   sick   I know not, but my Lazarus was en- tombed then and there, never to rise again. I set forth quite alone on a railway jour- ney which at that time occupied nearly six hours from Manchester. When I reached Birmingham I wandered about the town with as little idea of where I was to sleep that night as the most homeless of tramps, but I was not troubled about any incidental trifles of this kind. I had not come to sleep, but to hear and to see, and so long as I reached the Town Hall where the festival was held, I cared for little else. As I was gazing about the streets I was fortunately seen by Miss Maria Hawes, a well-known English singer of that day, who happened to be driving by in a cab, and who was to sing at the festival. She was a friend of my family, and stopped the cab to inquire what I was doing in Birmingham. I told her I had come for the   Elijah,   like every one else, and then only was I brought back to a sense of things temporal, such as tickets and hotels. She gave me a pass for the re- hearsal on that evening, and directed me to the Town Hall, where she advised me to go at once to procure a ticket for the concert of the next day. When I reached there I found that even' seat was taken, and I was forced to be content with what is called a promenade entrance. After this I turned my steps toward the largest hotel in the city, called by the attractive name of   The Hen and Chickens.  There I was fortu- nate enough to win the sympathies of the barmaid, who after telling me that every bed in the house was   bespoke,  took pity upon my loneliness and admitted that one room which had been engaged was not yet claimed, and that if the people did not ar- rive by nine o clock I might have it. I sup- pose they gave me some supper, but I have forgotten about it; I only remember that I went as early as possible to the rehearsal, and that I was admitted on Miss Hawes s NE of tl lections was whi   Elijah ingham ducted 339 Sonic Musical Recollections of lofty   cars order. 1 had a scat bv the side "f the nr ganist, I  r.   iauntlct.  v11  mi 1 agisted .il ter wa rd I iv  ntII ing mil the   irgan st'     s I    r him. and lull   f delightful excitement 1 awaited the entrani c ol the great Mendelssohn.

I bil- lowed every motion and gesture, and, in breathless expectance, waited for him to lilt his baton.

But as soon as his back was turned,  iauntlct would say to me i uiikly: "Pull them out again, pull them mil again.  He was obliged to plav from the I'ulJ score as no organ part had been written out, and his own disi retion was all he could relv upon in many places, but Mendelssohn had perfei I confidence in his judgment, as well as ad- miration lor his abilitv as an organist and musician, and especially selo led him to be the organist: on this oc  asi m.

But all this was forgotten Ihe next morning when I entered I he ci ilfee ri ii mi. Here was a stirring scene. I'verv musii inn ol note in Europe anil the I nited Kingdom seemed to be assembled there -pianists, violinists, singers, and com- posers. I have never, at any subsequent period of mv life, been ill the midst of such a galaxy of talent and genius.    ne theme was ihe subject of all conversation Men- delssohn. as 11 in dm tor, as com  x iser, and as pianist, though he did not on this occasion exercise the latter talent. At the performance that morning  the festivals were ;.l eleven o clock  I was forced to stand for nearly four hours in a dense   rowil, but I was quite oblivious to such effort when a musii al treat was in question. Not long before this I had stood outside Her Majesty s Theatre in London in just sui h another crowd, waiting for ihe gallery doors to open, mi a Jenny Lind opera night. Mendelssohn was one of the best con- ductors. but he would seldom beat more than the first sixteen or twenty-four bars of an overture or movement from a symphony; he would then lay down his baton and listen, often applauding with the audience. He would take- it up again when he wished a crescendo or rallcntanilo or any other effect not noted in the parts. The sensation produced by the last chorus ol the lirst part of the " Llijah,"  Thanks be to  iod,  was truly wonderful. i ine I cl t as il the Divine Presence had been evoked, so impressive, so awe-inspiring was its effect upon the listeners. The marvel- lous etlcct nl t,ie rain and rushing of waters given by the violins, and the stupendous bass    lortissimo, was bevmid human con- ception. I think Prospere with his mon- strous ophii leide added matcriallv to this splendid tone efft-i 1. In the chorus of the priests ol Baal the brass was particularly line. The bass part was sung by Herr Siaudigl, whose broken English took noth- ing away from the effect of Elijah's dec- lamation. lit- possessed a grand voice, and I have often heard him sing Schubert s " Wanderer,  ending with the low E of the first ledger-line below the bass staff.

Many of them are from the lower middle classes, who are not as a rule very cultured or refined, but the moment the spirit of music is awakened within them they are for the time being transformed, and able to interpret composi- tions of the most lofty and sublime charac- ter. Mendelssohn says, in the same let- ter before mentioned:  Not less than four choruses and four airs were encored, and not one single mistake oc- curred in the whole of the first part,  and further on he adds:  Not the slight- est sound was to be heard among the whole audience, so that I could sway at pleasure the enor- mous orchestra and choir, and also or- gan accompaniments . . . all executing the music with the utmost fire and sym- pathy, doing justice not only to the loud- est passages, but also to the softest pianos in a manner which I never before heard.  When Mendelssohn came to Manchester not long after the Birmingham festival, I had the great pleasure of meeting and talk- ing with him. My father was desirous of sending me to Germany to continue my musical education under his care, but his many engagements mnrle it impossible for him to assume any other responsibilities, and the plan was consequently abandoned. My musical studies went on mostly under my father s guidance, with the exception of a few lessons from Leopold de Meyer, the   lion pianist,  as he was called. He was one of my youthful infatuations, and nothing would satisfy me but to go to London and have some lessons from him. It was ar- ranged to send me thither where, al a guinea an hour, I received a few hints from this ex- traordinary personage. I went to his rooms for my instruction, and during the lesson he was generally occupied in being shaved, having his hair cut, or perhaps being meas- ured by his tailor or shirt maker. I studied only his own compositions during these precious hours, which I divided with many of the London tradesmen, and I thought nothing of spending whole days in the achievement of the "March d Isly,  the   Lucrezia Fantasia,  or the   March Maro- caine.  I managed to be present at most of his public perform- ances, and although my enthusiasm has cooled considerably since then, I still re- member his touch as the most wonderful combination of su- perb power and ex- quisite delicacy I ever heard. He was a per- fect mountebank on the stage, and his an- tics were made the subject of the most grotesque caricatures, representing him as playing with feet as well as hands, while the air about him was filled with the fragments of pianos and notes, the terror-stricken audience es- caping as best they might from his vol- canic technique. He was the author of many brilliant and effective piano compo- sitions not destined, however, to survive a short-lived popularity. While in London I stayed with Giulio Regondi, a friend of my family, and at that time a prominent figure in musical society. He played the guitar in a most remarkable manner, as well as the concertina, a small reed instrument invented by Wheatstone of telegraph fame. A most lovely quality of tone was produced by the mixture of differ- ent metals composing the reeds, and Re- goncli s genius developed all its possibilities. A criticism from one of the Manchester papers of that time describing his playing when he appeared there as a youth, gives so good an idea of his unique style, which for the time being held his audience spell- bound, that I copy it verbatim from my fa- ther s scrap-book:  Giulio Regondi quite took the audience by surprise. That an Some Musical Recollections of Fifty Years instrument hitherto regarded as a mere toy the invention, however, of a philo- sophical mind should be  capable of giving full expression to a brilliant violin concerto of I  e Reriot s, was more than even musi- cians who had not heard this talented  . o11h would admit. The close of every move- ment was greeted with a round of ap- plause in which many members of the or- chestra joined. The performer has much of the  fanatico per la nuisica ' in his a  i- pe.irance, and man- ifestly enthusiastic love for his art; he hangs iiver ani 1 hugs his little box of har- mony as if il were a casket of _, an only and dearly loved child. His trills and shakes seem to vibrate through his frame, and occasion- ally he rises on tip- toe, or flings up his instrument as he jerks out its highest notes, looking the while like one rapt and unconscious of all oatward objei is. in the absorbing enjovment of tlu- sweet sounds that flow from his magi  al instrument."

Richard Hoffman as a boy.   London, July 29, 1S24.  Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of the 27th inst. I beg to inform you that I wish my Son to play as follows: viz: At the first concert, a grand Concerto for the Piano Forte with orchestral accompaniment com- posed by Hummel, and the   Fall of Paris  also with grand orchestral accompaniment composed by Mascheles.  At the 2d Concert Variations with orchestral accompaniments composed by Charles Czemi, and afterwards an Ex- tempore Fantasia on a written Thema which Master Liszt will respectfully re- quest any person of the Company to give him.   We intend to start to-morrow afternoon at three o clock by the Telegraph Coach from the Wbite Horse Fetter lane, and as we are entire strangers to Manchester it will be very agreeable to us if you will send some one to meet us.  M. Erard s pianoforte will be in your town on Sunday morning as I shall be glad for my son to play upon that in- strument.   I remain, Dear Sir,  Yr very humble Servant,  Liszt.   15 Gt. Marlborough Street,   July 22, 1824.  Mr. Liszt presents his compliments to Mr. Roe and begs to say, that the terms upon which he will take his son to Man- chester to play at the concerts of the second and fourth of August next will be as follows:  Mr. Liszt is to receive one hundred pounds and be provided with board and lodgings in Mr. Ward s house during his stay in Manchester for his son and himself, and Mr. Liszt will pay the travelling ex- penses to and from Manchester.  Thalberg was a contemporary of Liszt in age, but did not appear in public until much later. He was equally astonishing in his novel passages for the pianoforte, which he 345 Si mu' M u im  Ue-ci illectii ms   1 I' ift     cars . i     ' 'Hi j 11 i -1 k  I vv i t Ii 11 ii  gruali-s1 u.i-  , : i u   I uiilmul any tln. airii.il uliud. 1 li-inrthi nl nl sustaining tin- muli ii Iv  1    Iiu   hi I. i I. while- 1    it Ii ham I.' fnamuil Irmii niiu e-nd "I  Iiu key I ii ian I Ii   I Iiu . it lu-r, w a-, si i nia r   ulli ms that I Iiu audiem    ii'Uil t. i stand u i t     -it Iih.'. it wasilntiu.

He studied the violin in Brussels under De Beriot, and on his return t i the States he made a tour throughout the country with De Meyer. I made my first public appearance in New York at a concert given by Burke at the Tabernacle. This was soon followed by one of my own given on Thanksgiving evening, when 1 realized the uncertain re- turns which mav be expected in concert enterprises. I should have been consider ably out of pocket after this bold venture had it not been for some kind friends, Mr. Ogden Haggerty and Mr.  rthur T. Jones among others, who on die next dav sent me receipts for the use of the Tabernai le and all other expenses of the concert. The pub Iii did not turn out in sin h numbers .is 1 had Imped for, and I found myself with an audience of three or four hundred people in a room, the seating capacity of wliii h was over two thousand. The Taberna.de was a large building on Broadway and Leonard Street, used on Sunday for relig- ious services and for all kinds of secular entertainments throughout the week. It was the onlv large room .nailable tor pub lie concerts or meetings except Ca-iile Garden  then used for the opera , and ils acoustic properties were very good. It was. however, a dismal, badly lighted place and the entrance could only be approached through a long, narrow alley Irom Broad- way. The New York audiences of today would revolt against the inconveniences which were cheerfully endured by their grandparents in oS. ;. I had been wiser had I taken the Apollo rooms on Broaclwa  which were smaller and more desirably located. There the Philharmonic Society gave their concerts, and I should have lol- lowed their example, but I was probably suffering from the com:  aint best known as  swelled head.  brought on, 1 dare say, by overpraise and considerable sell-conceit. My preference therefore leaned toward the Tabernacle, and there 1 learned my first lesson in humilitv, which doubtless had its good effect on my character. The programme for this concert, one o  which I have preserved and reproduced on page 350, will show what a rara avis the Vol. X LV11   36 grand piano was in  hose days. The one I played upon was made i-speciallv lor Mr. Jones, a leading amateur in musii , and he was good enough to lend it I   me on all great oi i asions.

W e were glacl to see him there on ihi- miasion, as il gave him an opportunity ol stamping on the minds of some ol our most dis  riminating judges an idea ' 'I hi  genius and talent." Al the time of my arrival in Xew   ork Some Musical Recollections of Fifty Years 351 there were many excellent pianists settled here Timm,William Scharfenberg, Dresel, Fontana  a pupil of Chopin , the two Racke- manns, Louis and Frederic, and a little later William Vincent Wallace took up his residence in this city. The musical critics were also of the best; among others, Henry C. Watson Otis of the Express, and Richard Grant White of the Courier and Enquirer. An occasional  bravo  from such men as these did mucli toward stimulating me in my public performances, and in furnishing me with an incentive to study and cultivate a higher grade of music than the general public demanded. My bravura playing always called forth abundant applause from my audiences, and it was a temptation to neglect the more serious music which alone can develop the true musician, but which at that time the musical patrons of New York were only willing to receive in small doses. In December of the same year I started on a concert tour with Joseph Burke, which lasted until the spring. As I look back upon that winter of  49 I often wonder how we held out as long as we did, through all the trials and discomforts attendant upon such an enterprise. Travelling was primitive and slow; we went by boat whenever we could, as time was not of the same impor- tance then as in these days of rapid transit. Concerts were postponed to suit the weather, and as tickets were rarely secured in ad- vance, we suffered the excitement of per- petual uncertainty as to the possible receipts from our entertainments. We began our experiences in Albany, where Burke had many friends, and we gave two concerts in Boston. We also vis- ited Worcester and Springfield, and went as far east as Portland. As we attended to our own advertising, it entailed the neces- sity of staying a day or two in each town before giving the concert, unless we could write in advance to a friend to herald our approach through the local papers. I rec- ollect they told us at Newburyport that it would be useless to ask over twelve and a half cents for tickets, and I think we re- duced them to twenty-five cents for that oc- casion. When our expenses were paid, my share of the profits in this town was under one dollar. Things were not quite so bad as this everywhere, however, as we man- aged to make our living out of it; but the Eastern States proved a barren field for our efforts, and we turned our steps southward, going to Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Wash- ington. We returned to New York in the spring, and afterward made a summer tour in the West, taking in Buffalo, Rochester, Detroit, Milwaukee, and even Chicago. Some figures of our receipts may illustrate the scale upon which these concerts were conducted. MCEIPTS EXPENSES First concert in Milwaukee, $89.50 $16.95 First concert itv Buffalo,   40.00 24-75 First concert in Rochester, 57.00 23.00 Three concerts in Montreal, 215.00 100.00 As tickets were always fifty cents, this repre- sented fair audiences. We often had difficulties in the smaller towns in procuring a piano, and I remember that in the town of Hamilton, Canada, we were in despair of finding one, when some public-spirited citizen offered to lend his square for the occasion, but with special in- junctions to return it the same night. The concert was given in the dining-room of the hotel and, when it was over it devolved upon Burke and myself to see that the piano got safely back to its owner. The absence of any "help  at that hour made it necessary for us to do the moving ourselves, and as the dining-room was fortunately on the ground floor, we proceeded to wheel it out on its casters into the street and to push it in front of us to its owner s house, a distance of two or three blocks from the hotel, where we finally left it in safety. This illustrates the simplicity of our methods, and savors of the backw-oods and early settlers. We were literally among the pioneers of art in this part of the country, and when I contrast our journey of 1849 with one I made last year  1895  over the same ground to Chicago, where I played for the first time since this early experience, it was hard to realize that such changes as I found were possible to have occurred in a space of time covering less than fifty years.

She proceeded determinedly, seeming to tight so  s with a courage that won his heart.

At this she shook her head soberly, per- fectly aware of the crisis in her affairs. With a deliberate gesture she pointed 1" the va- cancy, where second teeth were barelv showing, which made her consonants go wrc mg. " Tlut-Thur," she answered, at her ardu- ous best.  Thu-Thur   11 was as enlightening as Kgyptian hieroglyphics and sounded like the name of an Kgyptian princes-. "Thu- Thur  Try again   he begged.

She si limit- ed and puckered her lips, and he felt her lingers growing rigid with stern purpose.  Thu-Thur   she repeated. "Splendid  Most enlightening " said Rodd. But she saw that he was laughing at her. "Tools  Tan t " she exclaimed, with finality. He should not have another num- ber, no matter how mm h he applauded. The next best step seemed to be to find out where she lived." She answered Long Island. What part  To the westward, he concluded, after further probing. And the name of the town   "Thitich" was the nearest she could come to the original. " Well, Princess Thu-Thur of Thitich, as a matter of geographic consistency, you surely ought to live in Connecticut.  "Thu-Thur, Thitich, Tlietut," she re- peated, in the inspiration of the discovery of a new dc-ntal obstacle. "Tell daddy; he laugh,  she added. " Possibly the family w ill move for the joy of hearing you say it," mused Rodd. Then he tried to learn if there w ere anythingchar- acteristic of her tow n. " Very distinc tive a marked American community   he thought when he had as- certained that it had a church, a school, a railroad station, and a Carnegie library. After all, wasn't it the duty of helpless masculinity in suc h a predicament to con- sult the nearest feminine authority to where he had found her  "I am sure there are nice people in that house yonder," he said. "It looks like a house where nice people live, doesn't it  I'll take you there, and then we will-" He got no further, being interrupted by a Princess Thu-Thur s Half-Holiday trembling "Nn " arth ulated with a sob.

To the average parent the plane must seem a dangerous vehicle, thanks to all the impatient amateurs w ho w ere dashed into fences or hung up on telegraph wire-. But Thu-Thur was surprised at the avia- te  r s caution. " Mother thanks you. She a ill be dread- fully worried," she explained, grandly, with a delightful adult manner of reassurance. Still he hesitated. " Please   She slipped her arms about his ncc k and imprinted a kis- on his chin in a w ay that indicated that this was a mighty favor to a stranger and he was lost. Somewhere a frightened household was waiting for its precious Thu-Thur. He knew that on this halycon day she was as safe with him in the Fa ron as in a ponv cart behind a venerable, pudgy Shetland, led by a stalwart groom.

I'or mother,  she explained, starting to gather up  lie fallen asters. He assisted her. With her bouquet for "muddy held tight, he lastered her in the seal w ith a strap around her waist, and. de- termined to be in fashion himself, tied a spray ol golden rod to a brace. "Now. vou mustn't be afraid.  he said, "when the motor begins to purr like a big  .at.  " Not afraid," she answered, in a superior manner. " 1 beg your pardon.    1 course not," he apologized. He ought to have known that a princess who had set forth for the un- known on the tail of an automobile would fear nothing. What care he look to avoid any shock in the start  Runners grazing the petals of the ll  iwers, the hah on swept upward as if   in grc-asec lair       o-ee " exi laimed Her Royal Highness over the wonder  the wonder which makes tin. motorist, w ho has been a worm crawling through the pile of the rug, find himself a bulterlly skimming the variegated pattern. Tliev looked through the imaginary roofs of the open-air playhouses of a Saturday afternoon, which Rodd had come to sec. The spectators on the village ball ground in frantic demonstration over a two-bagger by a member of the home team, framed one pii ture; some elderly gentlemen at croquet framed another; a white figure on a tennis court in the next was seen a statue, with ra  ket uplifted; a young man was walking along a path with his arm around a girl: and the figures of golfers dotted a broader land- scape. It was a revelation w hich had set Thespian mobility into the noncommittal faces of taciturn men of affairs and lim- bered their tongues. "Oo-ee  Oo-ee " repeated Thu-Thur, and nothing more, as if living were the most natural thing in the world to her. Her imagination had not been loaded with the lead of fa  ts. 11 w as not so long since her spirit had emerged from the skv world w hither she was bound.  Can t you go faster " she asked criti- cally; and before he could answer she leaned over at sight of an automobile pass- ing at an angle to their course. "Little girl in bubble  Can t you pass her   " But it takes us i If our route," he said. " How ever, it is  mly a matter of a minute or two," he added as he saw her disappoint- ment, and w heeled in pursuit. " Nearer " Her Royal Highness desired and commanded.

My  but that was an aris- tocratic triumph of flight  Rodd was in- clined to trace a sense of feminine snobbery in Thu-Thur s attitude.   Let s go back and take the little girl fr r a fly, 1 she said, disabusing him of his worldly suspicion.  A beautiful idea, but I think we d better not,  he rejoined, setting the Falcon's course for Hempstead. Thu-Thur s gaze roamed the earth and heavens questioningly. Aloft a train of fleecy cumuli were pacing across an other- wise unflecked sky.   Can t go fast as the clouds   she sug- gested.   Oh, yes. If we were up there we would travel with the current that carries them,  he explained.  You see, they aren t walking. They are riding.  But that only excited her desire.  Please try   she begged, leaning over and touching his shoulder with her head.  Please try   Rodd recollected that the Mad Hatter once made a remark to the   March Hare that it was time to be serious.   See here, young woman,  he admon- ished her,  your mother may be crying. Think of that  And your father may be running about the fields, oh, so frightened, as he hunts for you.  She looked miserable as he painted the picture, but shook her head decidedly.  M-m no   she answered.  But what the   he began. The lisp was particularly trying; but so far as he could make out, only the nurse was at home, and her mother was away and would not return until the six o clock train.  But nurse will worry. She will alarm the whole neighborhood, and she will cry, too,  Rodd objected.  M-m no,  said Thu-Thur.  Nurse leave me alone and went walking with her steady company.   This partly explained, Rodd concluded, why Her Royal Highness had been able to climb on the automobile unobserved,   Bad, cruel nurse  She spanks me  No love her.1   she continued, looking at Rodd with an expression to melt a stone.  Yes, very bad,  he assented.   Please try to catch the clouds. Plenty of time   She cuddled ingratiatingly as she made the request. Not a ripple moved the tree-tops. The ocean lay as still as the shallows of Great South Bay.   You can t   She set his professional reputation at stake with a glance. She was arch and en- treating. She was such a little girl as you want never to grow up. If six, you would have her remain six forever, lest seven alloy the charm. Who could refuse an invita- tion to fly anywhere with her    Princess, your slave obeys.  said the foremost aviator of the day.   Oo-ee    said the Princess graciously to the slave. What a picture they made  The know- ing wrinkles around his twinkling eyes, each with a tale of far-flown distances to tell, wove themselves into a smile as young as hers. Tracing a loop of gradual ascent, the Falcon broke the calm with a wake of swirlingair. Underneaththescenespread, and Long Island, which held so many little pictures, became a tongue of green between waters that melted into haze. Thu-Thur, who took security for. gran ted, was not the least dizzy as she looked down, but mostly she looked ahead.  There s our door,  Rodd said, and, with a patch of blue as his goal, he sent the Falcon through a break like that bet ween two railroad coaches in the sprawling, ra- cing cumuli into a space that was all blue. They flew over the train of sunlit mist and, rounding its head, the earth, which it had hidden, reappeared.  You see we did beat the clouds,  he said, with juvenile pride yes, almost boastfully. But she seemed disappointed, even dis- illusioned ; and he ceased to think so well of himself.  Beautiful   she said, to please him.  M-m but she wasn t there    Wasn t there  Who wasn t there   he inquired.  Old Lady Riding a Broomstick,  she told him, revealing the secret of her desire.   No. I ll tell you something strictly con- fidential,  he said.  The old lady only comes out at night from a cave in the moon, where she lives.   You can t go to the moon   inquired the irrepressible Thu-Thur. Princess Thu-Thur s Half-1 loliday No, hi' li nl lo :i l niit 111:11 In- could not. She shook her head solemnly.

He did wish to go to the moon, and he knew he would never feel himself an egoist again. Thu-Thur's fancy, swifter than the   '   - rim, was alreadv looking for new experi- ences. A flock of wild geese were passing a few hundred feet below, their w ings beat- ing the faithful, enduring stride of the leet of veteran infantry in a long march. " Chase the birds    she said. He had ilayed among smiling, rolling, gleaming clouds, and fought angry, roaring, treacherous clouds, but here was an idea which had lever occurred to him when he was living for the pure joy of llight.  ' I. o you know why they keep together in a wedge .J  lie said.  Ticcai.se this is not a holiday for them. It s business. The leaders blaze a path, they make a sort of draught, lil e when you open the door, in the air. All that we learn from the birds."       o-ec " said Thu-Thur, with a natter- ing smile either understanding or pretend- ing to understand. He had dropped to the level of the goose flotilla s direct trail and, increasing his speed, drew nearer and nearer. Their squawking protest at tins mighty pursuer with strangely fashioned, motionless wings could be I card even above the motor. Suddenly they right-wheeled, but even in their fright keeping their formation with hct'ou fellowship. lie sti'pp.'ll the motor. and the full volume of their cries came piercingly to the ears in that feathery soli- tude.   Don't don't hurt the birds  Poor birds    said the Princess.  Poor tired 1 jirds     " You dear " said Rodd, who hated Ihe idea of injuring anything tha: llew, even a sparrow.

In the distance, it' lowers shining in the haze of its heated breath, lay the great city, a prison with gales opening outward to the country and under their feet the licket-ol-leave prisoners looking like shoe-butlons, as Thu-Thur said, bathing and delving in the sand of the I jeaches.  Now for home " said Rodcl. Her face turned grave at the suggestion, grave as the faces of the people at play would become il the sky should snow tele- grams ol bad news to every one. " Home   breathed Thu-Thur dismally. Kvidenth she was miserable with the weight of a might ' secret. She had told him only half of her story. Now she knew him well enough to make him her confidant in all.  No home  No daddy any more. No mother any more. Poor Thu-Thur      Why, how is that  " he asked, thunder- struck. The series of childish, nasal indrawings of breath went straight to his heart.  Daddy and another lady bad, bad lady    she said. "Mother cry and go to grandmother. Daddy go to Europe on steamer with the bad lady. Poor mother  Poor Thu-Thur " How could any father desert such a child as this.J Rodd was on lire with indigna- li  n.  I d like to tell daddy how I love him, then he d come buck and mother come back. Thu-Thur kiss them both. Happy Thu-Thur     They still coasted gently. He slipped a free hand around her in a mute effort to as- sist her in her battle against tears.  What steamer did he go on   he in-   iiired. " 'Tania   " she answered.   That 'Tania   she suggested, pointing out to sea to an ocean liner.  Yes, it s one of them the one that sailed this afternoon, no doubt.   Please catch steamer catch daddy   she implored, brightening instantly. ll her father were really aboard, what a retribution for him when Thu-Thur ap- peared     Yes, we ll catch her   said Rodd.  Oo-ce   said Thu-Tluir, till smiles again. In her quick changes of emotion she reminded him ol the grav squirrels in Y..i . X I.VII 358 Princess Thu-Thur's Half-Holiday Central Park, which put a paw over a pal- pitating heart one second and the next glee- fully nibble a nut. It was easy work for the Falcon a long, swift, gradual descent toward the steamer, which had shaken off the pilot and, harbor free, in the deep , broad lane had started it full speed on her long journey. Pier pas- sengers, baggage in place, were out of their cabins taking the first hearty breaths of salt. Their faces blossomed above the rail when they saw an aeroplane s flight, setting the ship for the target. As Rodd ran alongside even with the promenade deck, they broke into a cheer. Was it for the aviator, whose clean-cut face they recognized, or for the winsome little girl beside him, or both   He touched his cap and she waved the bunch of asters which she still held fast.

It s a password he can t fail to recognize, if he is    M-m no see him   said Thu-Thur matter-of-factly, as she strained her eyes.   Send the stewards through the steamer saying Thu-Thur; message for her daddy from Miss Thu-Thur and lisp it like that  Thu-Thur     Say, this beats me  What s it all about, Mr. Rodd   Aeroplane searching a ship     called a young man, who scented a story, which made the rampant curiosity of the passengers which had no way of expressing itself glad that a reporter was aboard.  Beats me, too,  answered Rodd, and wheeled the Falcon out of earshot, while he waited for the result of the investigation.  Oo-ee   half giggled Thu-Thur. Her face was close to her bouquet, mischief dancing out of her eyes in a way that seemed to Rodd out of keeping with the seriousness of the situation.  Too bad  I m afraid he is on another ship,  said Rodd.  Too bad   said Thu-Thur, but not as if it were really so, at all. Rodd had to smile to himself at the thought of the stew- ards knocking at cabin doors and lisping through the many passages of the liner.  Nobody responds   called an officer through a megaphone.   That settles it,  said Rodd, waving his cap in thanks. Thu-Thur waved her asters gayly.  Oo-ee   she whispered.  But   for he had expected her to break into tears.  Oo-ee  Look   She pointed at a gull which dove for a morsel of food in the boil- ing wake of the screw.   You can t pick up crumbs like the bird can  _ Something very like suspicion was gathering in Rodd s mind.  No, I cannot, and I ll not try,  he an- swered.   Your Highness, the Prime Min- ister is about to take a firm stand. It s home now  Not even if you should ciy I will not try  with a show of resolution to resist the spell of temptation she could weave about him. She regarded him studiously and saw this time that there was no daring him out of his course.  No crv, no cry   she answered, as if the very suggestion that she should ciy were ridiculous.  And we are going straight to Hemp- stead, and there we are going to ask about Thitich.   Siswich   Thu-Thur demurely cor- rected him and. to his amazement, with al- most no lisp at all. His scepticism grew. He knew the location of Siswich well. It was in line with his course to Hempstead, only a few minutes away over brown meadows and red and gold groves. In the afternoon sun the still windmills looked like the petals of big sunflowers, shot with the arrows of their guides. Thu-Thur, oblivi- ous of the landscape, studied her bouquet, with nothing to say except a single  My   in a long sigh.  Now, can you tell me where is your house   Rodd asked, as he slackened pace, with the highest church steeple of Siswich only a few hundred yards away.  There   she said, indicating a solitary oak among a younger.generation of trees. As they rounded it in their descent, a man and a woman on a veranda flashed in view. The woman was in a wicker chair, and the man was standing beside her, shaking something in a silver receptacle. It was anything but a scene of connubial infeli- city. At sight of an aeroplane alighting on their lawn they started ; and when they saw who the passenger was they ran down the steps in panic, the woman leading. e c.   o r "'Sol even il yu   rv I will u  -i ts y " 1 il;c " Susan Thurston  Susan Thuiston  Where on earth  .vluit on earth Susan "riiursti n     e. i laimei I I'llu- I'llur's nn ither. her voice running through the s ;ile ol incomprehension, fright, vexation, anil re- lief.

Late lit and tall; My spirit hows with every breath tliat thine Here lettetll fall:  The llick'ring world is witched and turned and trolled; And oh, my heart is wax. that once was hold; I perish straightway save that thou uphold;  Thou that art all. It was hut lately that a i liild 1 cane First upon life;   Loving spring  lowers, gentle, without Maine, Knowing not strife: The world was old ere battles bloomed for me; Rovhood was dreams and swoon ini' minstrelsv; I wandered all alone and wandered free Where dreams are rife. But all at once, the silver-crested surge   eased to be cloud, And thundered over me: 1 fell the scourge And sting, and bowed Under the brine, until, half dead, I lay Forespent upon the sand; and Irmn that day, Triumphant tonguec, the fury "t the fray   'alls me ah mil.

Vol. XLVII. 38 Hymn for the Vigil-at-Arms I would drink deeply, Lord, past joy and pain, Down to the lees; I would live life to every utmost vein; Like sap in trees Let me know root and branch; let this be mine, To drain the world s whole heritage of wine;  Co-parcener of pain with thee and thine. . ... I ask not ease. Yet . . . round my battered helm may dreams be bom, And raptures spring, As I have seen fair clouds a craggy horn Engarlanding; Let dreams be wings and waft me from the ground;  With sprigs of Arcady my brow be crowned, And where I lie, all battle-stained, be found The fairy ring. Let me look back on boyhood and be fain Of childish cheer; Make after fight, like robins after rain. Glad thoughts appear: Remind me of the sweetness of the May; Pink apple-blooms with starlight on their spray;  Exotic odors out of yesterday,  Let such be near. Let such be near, through all the storm and fret,  Near in the fight; The bitter wrong, the sorrow, the regret, Let these make right: For I no longer, Lord, take bribes of joy, Nor follow rainbows as did once a boy;  Give me my dreams, and let the years destroy Other delight. Give me the steps that unto Heaven s blue Steeply aspire; Lift me with song, and all my thoughts imbue With spirit fire:  Mine be the mould and measure of a man; Let me be strong, O Lord, to build tliy plan, But lest I fail . . . let me be greater than My heart s desire.

The enforcement of the 1.1- kins law and the passage of the Hepburn act in iqoo killed railway re- bating. It seems improbable that it will ever be revived. Two other problems of railway regulation of importance equal to the suppression of rebating, and of greater complexity, have now pressed to the front.   ine is the problem of establishing fair and satisfactory relations between the freight rates of rival producing and dis- tributing communities. W hile the Inter- state Commerce law now prohibits every form of secret discrimination, it prohibits only public discrimination which gives an   undue or unreasonable preference or ad- vantage'  to a person or a community. The long and short haul c lause even permits a higher rale to be c harged lor a shorter than fora longer haul when the  'circumstances and conditions" of the hauls are  .substan- tially dissimilar." Now, there are all de- grees of dissimilarity between the " circum- stances and conditions" of transportation. When is reac hed the "substantial dissimi- larity " w hie h the law -makers had in mind   There are various forms and degrees of dis- crimination betw een loc alities. When, ex- actly, do they become "undue and un- reasonable   Conditions in the United States make these queries very hard to answer. I'he second important question arises Irom the Hepburn act empowering the Commission to reduce rates that are ex- cessive. lt is exceedingly dillieult to sav when a rate is excessive. Hoes it become so when it brings in more than the current rate of interest to the railwav     r when it brings in more than the ordinary com- mercial profit  i ir does it become ex- cessive only when i  puts an unreasonable burden on the shipper   I'hese two great problems are met in their most i  implicated and refractory form in the territory west of the Missouri River; and differences over them there between the shippers and the railw ays have led to the greatest battle over freight rates ever fought in the United States. This struggle in- volves all the freight rates from all points on and east of a line drawn from the Ca- nadian boundary through St. Paul, Minn., and Kansas City, Mo., down to the Gulf of Mexico, to practically all points west of that line. It involves all freight rates from all points oil the Pacific Coast into a terri- tory extending eastward from the coast about eight hundred miles. Its result will settle whether or not the earnings of the roads concerned shall be reduced many millions of dollars annually. It will settle how the manufacturers and jobbers of the Fast, of the Middle West, of the Western intcrmountain country, and of the Pacific Coast shall divide the making and selling of the finished products consumed in all of the territory west of St. Paul, Minn., and the Missouri River, with its fast-growing wealth and population. The struggle is now going on before the Interstate Com- merce Commission. But the interests of the combatants are so diverse and incom- patible and the principles of rate-making that they seek to have applied so irrecon- cilable, that the sequel is pretty sure to be litigation in vvhii h the Federal Supreme Court w ill be asked to rule with finality on the question vv hie h is really the fundamen- tal issue involved, viz., whether, in fixing the "reasonable  rates which the law re- quites, the railways and the Commission shall use as the main touchstone of reason- ableness the cox  incurred by the railway in rendering the transportation service, or the value of that service to those to whom it is rendered. The complaining shippers ask the Com- mission to make general reductions in rates. The railways contend that under the Hep- burn act it can only change specific rates which have been specifically shown to be The Great Railway Rate Battle in the West unduly discriminatory   r excessive. If the Commission tries to make general reduc- tions, the roads undoubtedly will challenge its powers in the Federal courts. The re- sult of thi' contest is likely to influence greatly the future of government regulation of railways, and perhaps even the future of American railway transportation. The adjustment of freight rates in the West has long been the object of attack. The main reason is that it ignores distance to a greater extent and with more seeming arbitrariness than any other scheme of rates "in the world. It has not been created, as is sometimes assumed, by caprice or malice. It has slowly evolved in an en- vironment of unusual industrial, commer- cial, and transportation conditions. We shall understand it better after a glance at its history. The historical method of in- vestigation often explains what it cannot justify. Sometimes it explains and justi- fies what at first seemed neither explicable nor justifiable. Formerly the only practicable means of transportation from the eastern part of the United States to the extreme western part was by water around Cape Horn. In 1S54 the Panama Railroad was built. After that goods were carried bv water from New York to Colon; by rail from Colon to Panama; and by water from Panama to San Francisco. The first transcontinental railway was finished in iS6y by the com- pletion at Ogden. Utah, of the Central Pacific from the west and the Union I ai itic from the east. In that primitive period of railway history the traffic manager knew only one principle of rate-making. He  charged what the traffic would bear.  He did not mean by this that he charged all that the existing traffic would bear. That would prevent the development of more traffic; and to develop more was his main object. Fie meant that he charged all he could without hampering the movement or growth of traffic. The situation of the first transcontinental road, running through an undeveloped country, much of which was inhabited only by wild animals and wilder men, was such that it had to apply this principle rigorously. To get any of the traffic from the Atlantic to the Pacific Coast it had to make rates which would be as at- tractive to the shipper as the low rates made by water. It did not have to make rates as low iji proportion on traffic from the Pacific Coast into the interior; il had a monopoly nl that business. Il therefore made its rates 1 roni I lie Coast to 1 he interior relatively high. Nor did il have to make low rates to gel traflii moving from the east to the western interior. If goods for the interior 1 ame by water the shipper had to pay the mean rale, plus the rate of the railway I iai k In mi I he Coast. To all points within lour hundred or live hundred miles of the Coast the railway made rates that were equivalent. When ils trains on their way from the Past dropped goods oil at these points, it charged as much as if it had hauled them to the Coast and back. If its rate from New York to San Francisco was Si.00, and its rate from San Francisco to Reno, Nev., 50 cents, its rate from New York to Reno, Nev., was Si.50. The places to which rates were based on the rales to coast terminals were called  inter- mediate   pi  in is. When the Northern Pai ilie built to Ta   - 111a, Wash., the Great Northern to Seattle, Wash., the Atchison, Topeka Santa Fe to Fos Angeles, Cal., they one after the other adopted this same method of rate- making. and il is still followed.     ri gin ally the railway rates to the Pa  i lie Coast from Eastern cities not on the At- lantic Ocean were more than from New York City and other Atlantic ports. But the steamship lines began  absorbing  the railway rates from cities sin h as Pittsburg and Buffalo. t    the Atlantic, thus making the rate bv rail-and-waler from these pla  es the same as l v water from New York. The railwavs met this competition bv also mak- ing their rates from places four hundred or five hundred miles west of the Atlantic Ocean the same as from the Atlantic sea- board. The manufai lurers and merchants at 1 ities in the Middle West demanded the same rates to the Pacilii Coast as were given Pittsburg, Buffalo, etc., and the At- lantic seaboard. It was to Ihe interest of the roads extending from the Middle West to grant their demands. When a manu- facturer or jobber in Pittsburg shipped goods all rail to the Pacific Coast, the roads west of Chicago got only part of the rate. When a competing manufacturer or jobber in Chicago shipped them, the roads west of Chicago got all of the rate. Consequently, in i8i 4 the rates to the Pacific Coast were The Great Railway Rate Battle in the    est " blanketed   that i-.. made the  amc from all point  in the Pniled States east of the Miss,mri River.  'orrcsptHiding  hanges seldom have been made in the rates from the Last or  he Mid- dle W est to points in the Western interior. The rates to these places are not directly affected by water c ompetition, and there- fore on traffic moving to them the Fastern lines c ommniily exac t their usual local rates to the end of their rails; and the W estern roadsc ommonlvexac t their usual rates from there on. The distance   to Seattle. W ash., from St. Paul. Minn., is i,c oo miles; from Chicago. ;, joo miles, and from Xew York, ;,:oo miles. But the tirst-c lass rate to Se- attle, whether from St. Paul, Chicago, or New York, is S.voo per 100 pounds. The distance to Spokane, Wash., from St. Raul is i.-oo mik-s: from Chicago. 1,000 miles: and from New York, 2,800 miles; hut the lirst-c lass r; te from St. Paul to Spokane is Ss oo; from Chicago, $.S-6o; and from New York, S4.35. Nor do the class rates fully disclose the state of affairs. The great hulk of the traffic from the past to the extreme West is handled nn "commodity  rates, which are special low rates 011 spec i ie commodi- ties. Many more of these rates are made to the Coast than to the interior. This greatly increases the disproportion. Take, for example, a rather extreme instance, the item of   tir. boxes and lard pails, nested." When these artic les are shipped in car-load quantities to Spokane the fourth-class rate is applied, which is $1.00 from St. Paul; S . 10 from Chicago; and S2.45 from New York. But from throughout the Past to Seattle a uniform car-load commodity rate of 85 cents is made. Even cities east of the  'intermediate points" and whose rates are not based on the Coast terminals, in many instances have to pay higher charges than c ities 011 the Coast. These differ- ences are due to the policy ol the roads in exac ting their usual local rates on g.....Is shipped to the Western interior. Salt Lake City is i.ooo miles west of Omaha and Noo miles east of San I- ram iscn. The lirsl- 1 lass through rale from throughout the Last to San Franc isc    is S .oo. I he ship- per at Sail Lake has to pay only $2.0  from   imaha. Bat il lie buys goc L in  'hie ago he must pay the sum of ihe local rates.   The  lis .ui  s  r.vn art  r.tih ii  pr  Ximnlr. w I ii h is S2.S5 ; and il he buys them in New York he must pay S .52. I lie   blanket commodity rate from the Last to San Fran- cisco on structural iron is So cents. But when the shipper al Salt Lake   ity buys struc tural iron in Pittsburg, he has to pay ;:i cents from Pittsburg to the Mississippi River, plus 22 cents from the Mississippi River to the Missouri River, plus 65 cents from the Missouri River to Salt Lake City, a total of S i. 1 o, or ;o c cuts more than the through rate to San Francisco. In many instances the rate from the Last is higher even to Denver, Colo., than to San Fian- cisi o, although Denver is 1,400 miles far- ther east. The earlier attacks on this scheme of rates were based on the ground that it violated the long-and-short-haul section of 1 he Interstate Commerce law. Bui the Supreme Court of the United States held that water competition created  substan- tially dissimilar circumstances and condi- tions" that justified the making of lower rates where it was encountered. When the Interstate Commerce Commission was given express power to fix reasonable rites, the people of Spokane, Wash., renewed the contest. They filed the first complaint under the Hepburn act. They again al- leged that the rates were unduly discrimi- natory because higher to Spokane than to points on the Pac ific Coast. But this time they also  ct up that the rates to Spokane were excessive bec ause they yielded to the railways larger profits than common car- riers are entitled to earn. The Commis- sion took a great de;.l of evidence on each point. In its decision, w hic h was rendered in February, 1000, it ruled against Spokane on the first point. It said: ' It cannot be denied, in view of the un- cor.trovertcd facts, that water competition does exist, and that it does produce a controlling effec t upon rates to the Pacific Coast from many Eastern destinations. It is beyond doubt that this competition abso- lutely limits those rates from New York and points within a few hundred miles of New York to Pacific Coast terminals." Bui it ruled in favor of Spokane on the second point. It expressly held that tlie net earnings of the Northern Pacific and the Orcat Northern were excessive, and ordered them to reduce their class rates from Chicago and St. Paul to Spokane 103 1 ho Great Railway Rate Hattie in the    e t per cent., nr to the same level as their present rates to Seattle, and to make mr- respondin'' reductions in commodity rates, ll said that owing to w a ter competition the carriers do not violate the law I v maintain- ing higher rates to Spokane; and that it re- quired them to apply their existing rates to Seattle as their rates to Spokane mcrclv because these would lie reasonable rates to Spokane,  irrespective of Seattle.   The ruling that the rates to Spokane are excessive, because the net earnings of the railways have been unjustifiably large, is of the greatest interest and significant e. Il is without precedent in the derisions of anv Federal tribunal. I shall revert later to the very important question that il raises. I am concerned at present with the effect ol the decision on the adiiisliiicnl of rates.   ther transcontinental roads, sin h as the Union Pacific, the Southern Pacific, and the Atchison, Topeka  Sj Santa l e, have been earning profits comparal.ile to those of the northern lines. Their rates to other in- terior communities are as high in propor- tion as those to Spokane, lt lollowed that if the rHi'S to Spokane ought to be reduced, so ought those to the rest ol the interior. Other communities were not slow to see the point. Petitions for redui tionswere poured upon the Commission by communities from the Canadian to the Mexican border, in- cluding Walla W alla, W ash.; LeOrande and Pendleton. Ore.; Lewiston, Idaho; Reno, Xev.; Salt Lake City and Ogden, Utah; Phienix, Ariz.; and Las Vegas and Albuquerque, X. Mex. The northern lines suggested a plan of readjustment. This was to reduce class rates both from Chi- cago, St. Paul, and cities on the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, and from the 1 aciln Coast, to intermediate communities by i 03 per cent., and to make commodity rales from the Middle West to intermediate points 75 per i ent. of the rates to the Coast, plus the local rates back. On articles pro- duced mainly in the Fast the rates I mm the Atlantic seaboard would be the same as from Chicago. On articles produced both in the Middle West and in the Fast, the rates from the Atlantic seaboard to an in- termediate point would be the local rail rate from the Atlantic seaboard to Chicago, plus the rate from Chicago to the intermediate community. The obje  t of thus making the rates from the East higher in some cases than from the Middle West was to  give I lie W rstern lines an ad   a n  age b v originat- ing  he trallii nearer their terminals." I his plan called forth general protests. 1 lie jobbers oil the Pacific Coast objected that it would place them at a disadvantage in 1 onipeting against the jobbers in the Middle West lor business in intermediate 1 'immunities. The present first-class rate Irmn St. Paul lo Spokane is $3.00. A io- per   ent. reduction of this would be 50 cents. The first-class rate from Seattle to Spokane is $1.35. A 1 Of  per   ent. reduc- tion of this would lie only ul 1 ents. The absolute reduction from the Coast would be j-.l t ents less than that from the Middle West. The jobbers at Seattle and Ta- coma, Wash.; Portland, Ore., and San Francisto and Los Angeles. Cab, there- fore tiled complaints with the Commission protesting against the proposed readjust- ment, and alleging that the present rates from the Coast eastward are excessive both because they are higher in proportion to distance than those from the Middle West and because they yield to the railw ays ex- orbitant profits. The people of Spokane protested because although in all cases their rates from the Middle West would be lower, in some cases their rates trom the Atlantii seaboard, where they buy only 10 per cent, of iheir goods, would be made higher than n   w . The manufacturers and jobbers at Chi- cago, St. Louis, and other Middle Western i ities intervened to prevent the pcrn iild i of reduction from the Coast being made greater  hail from the Middle West. And, finally, the manufacturers and jobbers of Xcu York City and other places in the Fast intervened to argue that in no c ase should the rates I mm the Atlantic sea- board to the West be made any higher 1 om- pared with those from the Middle West than they are now   The Commission decided that il was not worth while to make two bites of a cherry, even such an extraordinarily big one. ll reopened the Spokane 1ase, and an- nounced it would give a series ol hearings at which it would investigate the entire Western rate situation; and hearings were held during the fall of iyo j at Salt Lake Citv, Spokane. Seattle. Portland. San Fran- cisco, and several other places. Xever were the rates of any section silted by a 36S The Great Railway Rate Battle in the West public body with such thoroughness, or at- tacked and defended with such skill, energy, and resources. In this, as in all other struggles over rail- way rates, the interest of the public as a whole is what ought to be considered by the Commissions and courts that are the immediate arbiters of such struggles, and by public opinion, which is the ultimate arbiter. And the main interest of the public is not that this or that contestant shall prevail, but that from the facts found correct prin- ciples shall be induced which shall be ap- plied to the beneficent solution of this and other problems involving the just relations between the rates of rival producing and distributing communities, and the respec- tive rights of the carrier and the shipper. It is plain what principles the complain- ing communities seek to have applied. They argue, in substance, that rates should be based on what it costs the railways to render the service of transportation. As distance is an inexact, but approximate, measure of cost of service, they ask that rates shall be made roughly in proportion to dis- tance. The railways contend, on the other hand, that rates should generally be based, not on what it costs the railway to render the sendee of transportation, but on the value of its sendees to those to whom they are rendered. The shippers  argument, as applied to the rates on a specific commodity, is as follows: The rate on green coffee, in car- loads, from New York to San Francisco, 3,200 miles, is 75 cents, or 4.7 mills per ton per mile. Now, of course, the railways make this rate to meet water competition. But it is not to be assumed that they vol- untarily fix a rate that does not cover the cost of the service, including operating ex- penses and overhead charges. But their rate on green coffee, in car-loads, from New York to Denver, 1,900 miles, is 93 cents, or 9.4 mills per ton per mile. It must fol- low that they make a very excessive profit out of this rate, and that it ought to be reduced to substantially the same basis per ton per mile as that to San Francisco. The railway traffic managers reply that this reasoning is fallacious. The initial fallacy is in the assumption that the rail- way will not voluntarily make any rates which will not cover all operating expenses and overhead charges. They make rates every day that do not cover all these things. The production of transportation, like the manufacture of several articles in the same factory, is an example of joint cost. The meat packer pays, perhaps, $7.00 per 100 pounds for a steer. He makes a number of things from the carcass steaks, roasts, etc. and finally, from the residue, fertil- izer. He does not sell 100 pounds of each for the average cost per 100 pounds of the steer, plus proportionate parts of the ex- pense of operating his factory and of his overhead charges. He sells porterhouse steaks for a great deal more than this. He sells fertilizer for very much less. The manufacture of fertilizer adds something to the expenses of running his plant. If he gets for it something more than this added expense, he can say truly that he has de- rived a profit from it, although he may not receive for it one-tenth as much per 100 pounds as he paid for the steer. He does not try to base his prices on his average cost, because if he did the prices of his higher-class products would not equal, and his prices for his lower grades of products would exceed, their value to his patrons, and his profits would be reduced both because he accepted less for porterhouse steaks than they were worth, and because he tried to get more for fertilizer than any one would pay. His sale of fertilizer for less than his average cost does not hurt those who pay him more than his average cost for other things; in fact, whatever he gains from making and selling it, tends to enable him to sell other things for less than he othenvise would have to charge. Now, the railway manager is in a situa- tion precisely analogous to the packer. The transcontinental railways haul goods to and from the Western interior. They haul vast quantities of fruit, vegetables, lumber, etc., from the Pacific Coast to the East. It does not make much difference in their total operating expenses whether they pull their cars to the Coast empty or loaded. If they can load their cars to the Coast with traffic that pays only a little more than the additional expense incurred by taking it, their net gains will be in- creased by that much. Now, the rates that they can get to the Coast are strictly limited by the rates by water. If they are made much higher than the rates by water the Coast shipper will bring his goods in by The Great Railway Rate Battle in the West boat, because the rail charge will exreeil the value to him of the nil servit e as   omjiared wit a the water servii e. These low ra'.es to the Ci iast, thel'efi ire, cannot, il is c untended, be taken as the criterion of the reasonable ness of rales to the interior where water c nn petition is not met, any more Iairlv than the   rice at which the  ia  ker scl Is Iei lili er can be taken as the criterion ol the reason- ableness ol ihe price at which he sells por- terhouse steaks. If these rates were made the measure of the reasonableness of the rates to the interior, the railways w   mid ha ve- to forego the Coast traffic and get all their revenue elsewhere, which would make ii necessary to charge higher rates elsew here. Many shippers concede that the railways should not be re  uin:-d to make rales to the interior as low in pro  irtion to dislant e as to the Coast, but contend that al least the rales h i the mterii  r sin mid not be higher absolute- ly than to the Ci last. The -relit ally, the rales might be made the same either by raising these to the Coast or by reducing those to the interior, but. as a mailer of fact, the charges to the Coast cannot be raised with out the sacrifice ol ,t great deal of traffu For water competition is 110 myth, as some writers with more imagination than know I edge have asserted. It is a slern reality. The American-IIaw aiian Steamship Corn pany now regularly takes goods from Xew York to Coat .acoalcas, Mexico, bv boat; thence across the Isthmus of Tehuantepei via the National Tehuantepec Railroad; and thence bv boat to destination, and lands them in San Fraiuisco in - tlavs from New York; in Portland in days, and in Seattle in 40 flays. With this last service, and with rates 20 to 00 per cent, lower than those of the railways, it has rapidly built up its business since it estab- lished this route on the opening o the Tehuantepec Railroad in 1007. The pres- ent size of ocean shipments to the Coast is illustrated bv the fat t that last year the boats, not including tramp vessels, landed 266,000 Ions of freight in Calilornia, while the Southern Pacifn carried there ol trans- continental traffic only :oi,ooo tons. It will be only a few years until the Panama Canal is done. The steamships can then give a much cheaper and taster service. Holy can it be said that the railways can raise their Coast rates when lacing such a situation   Suppose that they should adopt the other alternative and reduce their rates to the interior to the same level as their present rales to the   oasl. This would enable the jobbers in the interior to t otnpele more su  t cssl ully against those 011 the  'oast. Ihe railways would not mind this, lor lhey get all the traffu to the interior, while they have to divide that to the Coast with the boats. But the steamship companies would mind it, bet ause their prosperity de   lends entirely on t he grt iwlh and prt  s  icrily of the lilies oil the Coast. Undoubtedly, iherelore, they would make sut h re  11 j  lions in their rale-, as should be necessary t    enable the 1 ities of the Coast to 1 ontinuc to compete successfully with those in tin- interior. The Coast 1 ities always have had lower rates than those in the interior, and they always will have them; and this, re- gardless of what the railways have done in the past, and probably regardless of w hat they shall do in the fill.ire. The logical appl u atioii of  he distance print i  ilt- would be ruinous to the verv 1 om- munilies that are contending for it. If, on prim iple, rales into this territory should be based  n distant e, then, oil the same prim iple, rates mil of it on its products ought to I e based on distance. But both the I  a 1 i 1 i   Coast and the interior West art.- very remote from the great markets of the Fast where they sell their fruit, vegetables, lumber, ct: . To enable them to sell their products in these markets the railways have made mm h lower rates 011  hem in propor- tion t    distance than on similar coniniodi- lies when produced farther east. To these low rates is largely flue the   resent extraor- dinary prosperity o  the W est. As illustrat- ing this prosperily.il may be said that ihe postal receipts of Spokane, the chief com- plainant, i ii reased 2 14 per t ent, from rooo to 100N; its bank clearings 400 per cent., and its population 500 per cent. On the distance prim iple, these low rates from the West w 1 iu I 1 have to be greatly raised, to the eijual detriment of the Western producer and of Ihe Fastcrn 1 onsumer. It tloes ml m-i ossa ri I v follow that some readjustment of rates is nm feasible and desirable. The roads cnincde that some 1 hanges should be made. It is to the in terest of the entire nation, including the Western railways, that the development of the rich natural resources of the interior 370 The Great Railway Rate Battle in the West West should be fostered in every practica- ble manner. The only way the railways could put and keep it on an actual parity of rates with the Pacific Coast would be to get control of the water lines. Public opinion would not stand that. The roads may also help the interior communities con- siderably by reducing the rates charged their jobbers from the East and Middle West; provided, however, that they shall be at the same time allowed to maintain relatively high rates from the Pacific Coast eastward. If each reduction from the East and Middle West to the interior is to be accompanied not only by even greater reductions in the water rates, but also by corresponding reductions in the railway rates back from the Coast, the jobbers on the Coast will always have the same relative advantage over the jobbers in the interior that they have now. There will be no change in the relations between the rates to the contending communities, but only sim- ilar reductions to all and consequent deple- tions of the earnings of the railways. On the principle contended for by the complainants in these cases and upheld by the Commission in its decision in the Spokane case, however, justice would not be done by merely readjusting rates so as to alter the relative advantages and disad- vantages of the various communities. For, it is asserted, and the Commission in the Spokane case held, that the net earnings of the carriers have been excessive and that, therefore, their rates in general ought to be reduced. This brings us to the considera- tion of the second problem mentioned at the beginning of this paper, viz., whether rates may and should be reduced when and because the profits of the railways have become large. Those who hold the affirmative base their argument chiefly on legal grounds. In the view of the law railway companies are quasi-public corporations. They perform a public service; they exercise the right of eminent domain; and, it is said, in the language used by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1897 in the Nebraska Rate Case  Smythe vs. Ames, 169 U. S., 466 , ' What the company is entitled to earn is a fair return upon the value of that which it employs for the public convenience.  It is argued that a fair return is the legal rate of interest; and that when a railway s net earnings exceed this they are too great. This, of course, is just another phase of the cost-of-service theory. The argument epit- omized is that the railways ought to render the transportation service for cost including operating expenses and interest. The net earnings on the capital stock of the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific, which the Commission found excessive in the Spokane case, had been 10 to 15 per cent, per annum for six years; and the Com- mission said that the capitalizations on which this was based were only slightly more than it believed to be the values of the properties. Whether public authorities constitution- ally may reduce the rates of a railway on the ground that its earnings are excessive is an open question. The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States which has the most direct bearing on the matter is that in the case of Cotting vs. Godard  183 U. S., 79 , rendered in 1901. This was a case involving the constitutionality of an act of the Legislature of Kansas reducing the rates of the Kansas City Stockyards Company. On the rates fixed by the com- pany it was earning 11 per cent. On the rates fixed by the Legislature it could have earned 5.3 per cent. It was contended that the Legislature was justified in reduc- ing the charges of the company because its profits were excessive. But the Supreme Court unanimously held otherwise. Jus- tice Brewer, who wrote the opinion, said:   As to parties engaged in a public service, while the power to regulate has been sus- tained, negatively the Court has held that the Legislature may not prescribe rates which if enforced would amount to a con- fiscation of property. But it has not held that the Legislature may enforce rates that stop only this side of confiscation. ... It has declared that the present value of the property is the basis by which the test of reasonableness is to be determined, al- though the actual cost is to be considered, and that the value of the services rendered to each individual is also to be considered.  He quoted many decisions in which American and English courts had passed on the reasonableness of the charges of public service corporations, including rail- ways, and, summing up, added:  The authority of the Legislature to in- terfere by a regulation of rates is not an The Great Railway Rate Battle in the West 371 authority to destroy the principles of these decisions but simply to enforce them. . . . The question is always not, What does he  the person performing a public service  make as the aggregate of his profits   but, What is the value of the services which he renders to the one seeking and receiving such services  Of course, it may some- times be . . . that the amount of aggre- gate profits may be a factor in considering the question of reasonableness of the charges, but it is only one factor, and is not that which finally determines the ques- tion of reasonableness.  While this case involved the rates of a stockyards company, the railways maintain that it established a precedent for railway rate cases. They argue that so long as the rate that they charge a shipper is not unduly discriminatory or in excess of the value of the service rendered to him, he cannot complain that it is unreasonable because it yields the railway a larger profit than some other rate, or because from all ofitsbusiness the railway s profits are large. It is contended by the railways that even if the public, through commissions or legis- latures, has the power to so reduce the rates of railways as to limit their net earnings to the current rate of interest, it will not be economically expedient to exercise it. What has enabled the railways in the West to struggle up since 1897 from bankruptcy to their present prosperity   Shippers say that it has been the general prosperity of the country and the consequent growth of traffic. But in one way the railways of the country have not shared with other business concerns in the general prosperity. It has been a period of large advances in the wages of labor and in the prices of materials. The railways have had to pay their share of these higher wages and prices. But, unlike other concerns, they have not been able, in the West or elsewhere, to advance materially the prices of what they sell transportation. Can it be said, then, that the increase of their net earnings has been solely due to the growth of traffic   This question was touched upon in an article in the North A merican Review for September, 1909, by a competent and disinterested observer, W. M. Acworth, the leading authority on railway economics in England. His conclusion was that the great change in their financial situation has  arisen mainly from the stern lesson of adversity taught to Americau railways in the year 1893, and the way in which American railway officers took those les- sons to heart.  He added:   If an outsider might criticise, I should say that I am startled at the ingratitude which the American public has displayed in return for the marvellous skill and energy with which American railway men revolutionized the operation of American railways in the years when traffic began to recover after the panic of 1S93.  Mr. Acworth implies that the main cause of the large increase in net earnings has been the reductions in operating expenses that have been effected by improvements in the railways  plants and in the methods of operating them. A large part of railway net earnings, whether first paid out as divi- dends or not, has always been invested in improving the existing lines or in building new ones. This has been of great benefit to the public. But, say railway managers, the main incentive to improve and reduce the expenses of existing railways and to build new lines will be removed if it shall become the policy of the Government to appropriate for the benefit of those who furnish neither the money nor the brains for railway improvements and extensions all the net earnings above a certain low maximum. It is argued that so long as the rates of the railway do not discriminate or impose an undue burden on traffic it is entitled to earn at least the ordinary rate of commercial profit in the territory where it does business. It is contended that the prosperity which the West is enjoying shows that the rates of the railways as a whole lay no undue burden on its com- merce. It is shown that the average an- nual profits of the very jobbers who most complain are, according to their own testi- mony, from fifteen to twenty per cent, per annum. It is argued that in view of these facts, there is no justification for sweeping reductions in freight rates. Railway rates in the United States have universally been based on the value of the service. The adoption and consistent ap- plication of the principles contended for by the shippers in these Western cases would work a revolution. A simple illustration will indicate what would be the effects. Coal is shipped to every city in the country from a large number of mines. Under the The Great Railway Rate Rattle in the W est prt  si'nt met In  1 rates f r  mi the r earl  v mines arc made relatively high per mile and from the mure reunite relatively low. This eii allies all  he operators ill a large distric l to sell their output in a large market at a pnmt, and the people at that market to buy their coal from any of these operators that they please. On mileage rates the opera- tors of the nearest mines would get and keep a monopoly of the market until their mines apprcached exhaustion, while the more distant coal mines would lie rendered comparatively valueless. The present method of rate-making tends to stimulate commercial competition; basing rates on distance would tend to build up petty mo- nopolies in every community. At present rates are made much higher in proportion to the cost of transportation on valuable than on cheap commodities. On the basis of cost the ntes on valuable commodities would have to be much reduced and those on cheap commodities to lie much raised. Many commodities are so bulky in propor- tion to their value that under this plan they could not bear the rates imposed; they would be excluded from the avenues of commene; their producers would lie ru- ined: and ti e public would lose w hatever advantage it now derives from their use. Thf proposition to base the earnings of railways on the cost of furnishing transpor- tation seems as untenable and inexpedient as the proposition to so base their rales. The builders of a new railway always hope for profits, but always take the risk of getting none. The owners of existing railways always hope that investments in improvements in their plants will reduce operating expenses more than they increase interest charges, and thereby yield a proht; but they always take the risk of increasing interest i harges more than they reduce operating expenses, and incurring a loss. Now, it seems obvious that men will not go on taking the risk of building new raii- wavs and making expensive improvements in old ones if the Ciovcrnment is to appro- priate by reductions in rates all their profits over the current rate of interest, for thev can get the current rate of interest elsew here without taking such risks. There are many freight rates in the West and elsewhere which tire unjust. The nation w isely has clothed a public tribunal with power to correct such results of the traffic manager s poor judgment, unfair- ness, or malice. But however the carriers mav have erred or sinned in details, the print iples for which thev contend seem right. By making rates on those principles they have contributed enormously to pro- moting the industrial and commercial de- velopment of the United States. If those principles tire right, it is of vital importance tha: the Interstate Commerce Commission and the courts shall adopt them in regulat- ing rates; for the principles that they adopt in regulating rales must ultimately prevail in making rates; and on how ratesshall hie made largely de  icnds the future    f transportation, industry, and commerce in this country. THE HOUSE OF BROKEN SWORDS By William Hervey Woods On one side marshes met the snarling sea, And on the other three gaunt mountain peaks Shot up  mid screaming eagles; and between, Beetling above an inky tarn, upclomb That hostelry. Cloud-high it loomed, and dark As Amazonian forests. Far o erhead Its shadowy roof, sometimes but spindrift dim, Sometimes was heaven, with lucent twilight skies Besprent with stars; and round each echoing hall In carven ambrys quaint, old storied arms Blazoned the walls. There on Goliath s blade Goliath s blood still rusted; there sea-born Excalibur flaunted his wizard hilt, And Soldan s yataghan and Richard s brand Hung with the baton that in Ca:sar s grasp Dispeopled nations. But the loftiest nave In that strange house was hung with broken. swords, Whereof the chiefest three had shields beneath Scrolled each with shining names. One shield was his Who long time humbled Rome, and one, blood-red, Recalled the Corsican; and last a shield, Now wet with old men s tears, proclaimed the chief Whose ramparts linger  mid Virginian pines. Untenanted the place, to casual eyes, And silent; but anon began afar Onset of armed feet, and thunders rolled  Thunders or battle , and a hand unseen Lifted a veil, and Lo  a marching host Swept through the aisles, while on amazed ears Sea-like uprose the Prayer of Beaten Men.  We are the fallen, who, with helpless faces Low in the dust, in stiffening ruin lay, Felt the hoofs beat, and heard the rattling traces As o'er us drove the chariots of the fray."   We are the fallen, who by ramparts gory, Awaiting death, heard the far shouts begin, And with our last glance glimpsed the victor's glory For which we died, but dying might not win.  We were but men. Always our eyes were holden, We could not read the dark that walled us round, Nor deem our futile plans with thine enfolden  We fought, not knowing God was on the ground.

THE NEGLECTED ART OF ORATORY By Francis Rogers  URIXG the past one hun- dred and filly years there have been many great men wiuA Bgjjp'.iSy in this country whose lead- -rouM ership and wlmse inlluence upon the affairs ol their time have been largely due tn their skill in the use of the spoken word  to their ora- torical ability. Patrick Henry, James   Iis, Hamilton, Clav. Calhoun, and W ebster arc- some of the miglitv orators whose lame has come duwn tn us in written record: then, through Rufus Choate, Edward Everett, W'endell Phillips, Henry W ard Beecher, and Phillips Brooks the great oratorical tradi- tion descends almost tn our own dav. With Beecher, w hom Dr. Lyman Abbott rates as the best-equipped orator to whom living ear has listened, and with Brooks, the embodi- ment of all that is best in pulpit eloquence, the line seems lu have come t   an end. Today there is one man who can lav just i Eiiin to this rii h inheritance  William Jennings Bryan. However widelv we may dissent from Mr. Bryan's political views, there can be but one opinion as to his truly extraordinary gifts and a  hievements as a public speaker.   'an one imagine a more thrilling and ex hilarating pleasure than that of swaying with one s words a listening host of people, warming or   ooling t heir passions, I lending their thoughts and wills in ilie direction of one's own thoughts and will, even as Brvan did at the Chicago Convention in 180O  'Phis power has wrought mightily for both good and evil, and it is astonishing that nowadavs so few speakers should train themselves lo w ield skilfully such an effect- ive weapon. Every lawyer, every preacher, every politic ian, every man, in fact, who has occasion to address audiences, ought lo study the technique of oratory so that liecan at will, within his own sphere and limita- tions, interest and persuade his hearers. No art is so neglected in these days as that of oratory. The writer, the musician, and the painter give years of study to the acquisition of their respective arts, but the preacher and the public speaker, often enough unacquainted with even the rudi- ments of the art of oratory, seem to feel that when they suc ceed in speaking their words audibly, they have done all that can reasonably be expected of them. The speaker who uses his voice skilfully and effectively, who makes graceful and illu- minating gestures, and who stands nobly upon his feet, is one of the rarest of birds. And yet the requisites for a good ora- torical technique are within the reach of nearly everybody. Manv a great singer was laughed at in his early days for his apparently foolish ambition, because his friends thought his voice absolutely without promise. Jean dc Reszke was approaching middle lite before fame began to smile upon him, and the history of the concert, as well as the operatic , stage show s to us over and over again that determination and persist- ence have muc h more lo do in bringing about ultimate success than the initial pos- The Neglected Art of Oratory session of a beautiful voice. In the history of acting the weight of testimony is on the same side. Coquelin and Ilenry Irving are pertinent instances of dramatic triumphs founded, not upon natural gifts, but upon laboriously acquired technique. The art of the orator is of close kin to that of ihe singer and of the actor, and by just the same methods of intelligent study as those which the singer employs to train and per- fect his voice and diction, and those bv which the actor learns to portrav nature on the stage, the orator can develop and fortify his own technique. The two requisites for effective oratory are, first, to have something to say; and, second, to know how to say it. Strangely enough, there is an opinion, only too gener- ally held, that the first requisite alone is sufficient, and that if one has something to say, some mysterious power will inspire one with the ability to say it persuasively. Especially have 1 heard ministers sustain this point of view, in the very face of the fact that the decadence of the art of oratory is nowhere more strikingly exemplified to- day than in the pulpit, where ill-managed voices, indistinct utterance, meaningless gest- ures, and wearisome, often comic, manner- isms are the rule rather than the exception. I recall hearing a distinguished clergy- man who, when preaching, had a habit of raising himself on his toes and raising the pitch of his voice simultaneously; and then, when toes and voice could be stretched no higher, quite regardless of the rhetorical effect, would fall back on his heels and drop his voice to an inaudible murmur. An- other well-known parson, a few bloc ksdown the street, used, in the first five minutes of his sermon, to roar himself so hoarse that at its close his voice was reduc ed to a raucous whisper. A surgeon told me of a patient of his, a clergyman, who had actually thrown his spine out of plumb by the mighty blows which, during his sermons, he delivered with his good right arm upon the unresisting air. Everybody can easily add instances in point from his own experience.  Jood pulpit ora- tors are as scarce as good operatic tenors, and the case of public speaking in general is scarcely less lamentable. I make no attempt to deal with the psy- chological side of this subject, alluring though it be, but make a brief plea for the study of the mere physical technique ol which every speaker stands in need. The object of the- orator is to make his auditors think and leel as he wishes them to think and feel. If he   annot do this, he is a fail- ure as an i  rat   r; and I ha f the orator of our time so seldom mh c eeds in doing this is due, in large part, to his never having mastered the tec hnique of his al l. East winter a clergyman Icd  1 me that he had never studied c-loc ution for fear that it might make him self-conscious in the pul- pit. This is, perhaps, only another w ay of saying,      here ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be w ise.  As sensible for the student of the violin to neglect, for the same reason, to study the correc t position and use of his hands and fingers in playing his instrument.    f all public speakers the preacher should be the most eager to submit himself to crit- icism, because the conditions under which he prac tises prevent him from hearing any unfavorable comment on his preaching, un- less he deliberately seeks it. The president of a large university used to take but a slight interest in the depart- ment of elocution, maintaining that if one had something to say, it w as easy enough to say it, without bothering about a special training in speech and gesture. The head of the department ventured one day, in a moment of exasperation, lo reply to him,  But don t you think, sir, that your own bearing upon the platform would be more impressive, if you refrained, when speaking, from clasping your hands over your waist- coat, twiddling your thumbs, and shuffling your feet    In laudable contrast with this mistaken altitude is the c ustom ol a certain bishop fo preach a sermon at least once a year in the presence of a teacher ol elocution, whose duty it is to criticise the delivery of the ser- mon from the point of view of the expert. I recommend just such a course as this to every speaker, no matter how perfect or experienced he may think himself. The speaker, like the singer and the actor, can neithersee nor hearhimself as others see and hear him, and for this reason, even if he has once been thoroughly grounded in the tech- nique of his art. hasbuta very limited ability for self-c ritic ism. His most dangerous and insidious enemy, the mannerism, is c ertain, under one form or another, to take posses- sion of him, unless he has some frank critic to warn him betimes of its approach. 376 The Neglectcci Art of Oratory Why should the art of oratory, alone among the arts, be considered exempt from the study of technique  To do anything well we must have technique. The good business man has his, just as the skilful sur- geon and the billiard expert have theirs. Technique in any line of endeavor is, after all, only the knowledge of how to achieve one s end in the easiest and simplest way. There is a period in the life of every student when preoccupation with technique causes self-consciousness, but this self-conscious- ness disappears as the technique affirms itself. One might say that technique in piano-playing is superfluous, because Pade- rewski s playing is so entirely free from self- consciousness. But there was a time when Paderewski played self-consciously and la- boriously, and his present artistry is due to years of persistent, well-directed effort to acquire the mechanical mastery of his instru- ment. Ars cclare artem. I should apolo- gize for uttering such trite commonplaces about any art, if the art of oratory were not so often held to be superior to, or outside of, the general law. Emerson asserts that power is composed of innate impetus or temperament, con- centration, and drill. In the same essay   Power   he says:  Practice is nine- tenths. A course of mobs is good practice for orators. All the great speakers were bad speakers at first. Stumping it through England for seven years made Cobden a consummate debater. Stumping it through New England for twice seven years trained Wendell Phillips.  Innate impetus, or tem- perament, is in the gift of the gods only; concentration and drill are well within the domain of the human will. Demosthenes, the most famous of all the world s great orators, though endowed by nature with the requisite temperament, was at first hindered in his ambition by several bodily defects. To remedy a hesitating and obscure utterance he taught himself to speak distinctly even with pebbles in his mouth; to cure a shortness of breath, he climbed hills and exercised his lungs system- atically; to enable his weak voice to carry above the shouting of a mob he trained it to dominate the roar of the breaking surf. This discipline to which he submitted him- self in order to overcome difficulties that to a less determined character would have seemed unconquerable, gave him a tech- nique in his art which has had no equal in the history of oratory. The art of the orator is closely allied with that of the actor, except in that the orator speaks his own thoughts, while the actor utters the words of another. Their pre- liminary training is the same first, the study of the mechanics of breathing, voice, articulation, and pronunciation; and then the study of the expression of thought and emotion through the infinitely varied use of voice, facial expression, pose, and gesture. The orator, like the actor, must learn to hold the mirror up to nature, and to sway by con- scious means the minds of his hearers, just as Shakespeare s Mark Antony swayed the Roman mob in the presence of Caesar s body. It is an endless and fascinating art, which carries one deep into the study of human nature and of the stimuli to which human nature will respond. One must under- stand familiarly not only the psychology of the individual, but also that of gatherings of individuals, and be able to read their minds even while one is speaking to them. An audience is an antagonist who dares the orator to enter the arena with him, and to interest, instruct, amuse, and move him. If the orator accepts the challenge and fails in the contest, the public will have no more of him; but if he is strong, resourceful, and trained to the minute, he will soon have his opponent at his mercy, and by the victory win the admiration and affection of his audience, which always dearly loves to be subjugated. The world has always rewarded its great orators generously, and unless human nat- ure has undergone a fundamental change, it is even now holding precious laurels in store for those who shall charm its ears with golden speech. Why is it that there are so few who think these laurels worth the win- ning  In some degree we all are capable of earning a share of them, and even if the gods have not granted us that innate im- petus without which the highest pinnacle of oratorical power is never attained, we can by intelligent and persistent effort acquire at least a technique which shall win for us some of the minor triumphs of the success- ful orator. -THE POINT OF VIEW   EVKRN war, lor some years now, a     I  bra ted 1'i'ciuh singer 11aconn- I" us whose business has I m      11 to sing sini  .le Intl.- songs o ' the long ago      n-.nl in know I Ii is samt1 singer, oner upon a linn, as most modern in llir inlcrpretalion of Inr repertoire, evrn wIkii il harkt-tl hack to tin- foil; song, llir ok 1 I ii-i ii 11 i h t ii 'im  I;:  Songs liut now Wr 111    1 lirr using .ill I lie rrsourct-s of lirr art to strip hnsth. as nnii'li a- mav Ih-, ol all sophisi ii alion i inr may hr so admiring of iln- woman's sliarr in tlir transformalion  which chooses to prrsrnl Id your vision a ipiaint, I'rrsli, inaltrr-of fat t Victorian pi-rson whom you nrvrr saw hrforr, rallirr than a twrnl y-vrars lalt-r edition of the samr erstwhile iiliosvni ratic personality, w hit h woulil inrvital'ly bring with it. a trail of tire sDtur comparisons  that onr may overlook tlir artist's sliarr.

I AM inclined to think that as to one feature in our   in 1,1 ic life, we Americans are a little too modest;   ut 1 hasten to say that our apparent excess of modesty is due to our igno- rance of tlie fids. We are wont lo sing rather small when a question arises as to tlie level ol debate in the Congress of the United States as compared with ihe level reached in the I nited Kingdom, in Germany, or even in France. We stand mute when we hear ihe praises of Mr. Balfour, Lord Morlev, Lord Rosebery, of Prince Billow and llerr Hebei, of Clemenccau and Jaurcs, and we hardly realize I ha t we have al Washington, from time to lime, debaters who, if not equal to these in scope and style, are bv no means inferior lo them in the adequate performance of the task that discussion in Congress imposes, ll must elearlv be understood, at the outset of a comparison of this sort, llul die task at Washington is essentially different from that in London or Berlin or Paris. Fat h of the Furopean capitals is the seat of a highly cen- tralized government, dealing wit l questions of great importance at home and with foreign questions ol world-wide concern. No Amer- ican "budget." if we had one which, in the sense of a responsible statement of taxation and expenditure, we have not would begin to ha e so intimate a relation to the life of the people as has that oi Mr. Llovd-George, or that on wliicli Prince Billow was overthrown, or that in the discussion of which M. Clemen- ccau so suddenly and almost accidentally met a lall. Moreover, in London and Paris the Government of the dav depend directly anil completely mi the possession of a majority in the popular branch of ihe national legislature, and in Berlin there is a sort of indirect depend- ence of thi- sort Hence the parliamentary debaters are lighting for lheir political lives, ami the struggle puts them on their mettle whenever a "trisis" approaches. Nothing of the sort oct urs at Washington. No crisis can arise that can dislodge the party in power im- mediately, or is likely completely to break its lit,It I. if that hold lie strong, in a long time. In the last quarter of a century there have been four political changes in the Presidency in ix.x. , iSSX, iSoj.and iStj6 but in all that time there has been but one brief term of two years in which the President and both Houses of Congress were Democratic. Il may be a wise arrangement oi checks and balances that makes "crises" so rare and so dillicult to cal- culate, but it is obvious that il makes discussion in the American Congress a very different thing from discussion in a Furopean Parliament. Hearing in mind these marked differences in conditions, I think a very fair case may be made for American debaters. In the matter of form, one thing may properly be emphasized the courtesy observed, especially in the Senate, is quite as uniform and of a character as refined as that of the House of Commons, and decidedly superior to that prevailing in Berlin or Paris, and though this quality is more imperative in our Senate than in the House of Representatives, il is the general rule in the latter also. As for the more fundamental characteristics command of facts, force of presentation, aptness in retort these appear, w hen occasion offers, 11 an extent not generally appreciated.    ccasion did arise in the recent   xtraordinarv session   f the Congress culled to revise the tariff, and it was met. particularly by the members of the majority w ho opposed their party, with a really admirable demonstration of talent and skill. The polish, for example, of Sera tor I  olliver of Iowa, if not equal to that of Mr. Balfour grappling with an analogous sub- ject, was by no means beneath comparison, w h:lc his vigor, candor, and sustained elevation of argument were quite up to the best English standard. 1 am aware that this opinion may surprise readers who get their impression of debates in the American Congress from the newspapers, but it is one of the drawbacks in our political life that the newspapers, for vari- ous reasons, do not give an adequate or correct impression of these debates. If the Capital were New York, or Chicago, or even Boston, their treatment of the matter would be differ- ent anti far more thorough. Much fuller re- ports would impose themselves and would not lie denied. As it is, the perspective of the press and its readers is deranged, is, in the pop- ular phrase, "queered," bv conditions of pub- lication. And, apart from this, there is the undeniable fact that no large proportion of the The Point of View American people are much interested in most of the subjects of debate at Washington. There is a certain partisan ii tciest, but that is usually vague. Very little direct, intimate, practical interest is aroused such as one finds in England or even on the Continent. American debates do not come home to the business and bosoms of men as do those of foreign parliaments in the capitals of more centralized governments. Whence what I am persuaded is the mistakenly low popular impression of the ability and equipment of our national legislators. I N the eighteenth century, and even in the earlier years of the nineteenth, the tontine was a favorite form of speculation.

Although the tontine has now fallen into in- nocuous desuetude, ii was alluring in its way; and it was specially tempting to strong men with superb confidcrce in their own vitality. Indeed, its attractiveness is exactly the reverse of that of life insurance, in which, as the California gambler put it, "you have to die to beat the bank.  Although the tontine no longer appeals to the speculative as a method of getting a good deal for very little, il can be discovered still in existence in other realms of human activity than the financial. In politics, in literature, and in art some of the men who manage to sur- vive beyond the allotted threescore years and ten profit unduly by the mere fact of their longevity. Thev gain an excessive reward in reputation by survivorship. The aged politi- cian who has retired from active service, lingers in the public gaze in the lofty position of a Sage; and he bulks bigger in the eyes of his younger contemporaries simply because he still exists in the flesh. For example, we may query whether Gladstone, who attained to fourscore, was really a wiser and a more far- seeing statesman than Canning, whose career was cut short at less than threescore. In other words, Gladstone lived long enough to profit by what we may call the tontine of fame. In literature the examples of this acquisition of a wider reputation by mere survivorship are abundant. Shelley and Keats were cut off in their youth, before they had accomplished all their early promise; and Teinyson survived and ripened and matured and was able at last to achieve the fullest expression of his native endowment. Hut if Tennyson had died at sixty,   r even at lil'tv, the body of his work would be smaller, but it would be onlv a little less significant and only a little less valuable. Vet his reputation kept on spreading and branching out, largely because he lived on into a green old age. Alfred de Musset died voting, and Victor lingo attained to more than four- score years, with his fame steadily rolling up like a snow ball, and until the disproportion between the reputations of the two poets came to seem emphatically unfair. Might not the- re la live positions of   1 oet he and of Schiller have been more or less modified if it had been the author of ' Faust  who had died in middle life, and the author of the   Robbers   who had lingered long into the nineteenth century  And consider certain of our own American authors, more especially the poets. Bryant won his reputation in his youth,and can scarce- ly be said to have greatly advanced it by any- thing which he wrote after he was thirty or forty. Flu he continued to walk the streets of Xew Vork until he was long past threescore years and ten; and his good gray head con- tinued to give dignity to public meetings of one- kind or another. Can it be denied that when he died his tame had profited hv his longevity, and that he seemed then to be a greater man than he will be in the opini  n of the next generation that knew him not  Consider I oe, snuffed out earlv, and Whitman having the vitality to outlive the early hurly-burly about his more aggressive works. Whitman won a prize in the tontine of fame which I oe failed to secure. Whitman was paid compound in- terest on the later years of his life. OUR   multi-millionaires  are faring bad- ly ct the hands of the art critics. Those in England complain that some ca- price of vulgar taste is leading these omnivorous buyers to absorb all the masterpieces of the past into their private galleries: and those of America ate complaining that this , Art . nf  rlo- passion for expensive masterpieces Muiti-Mith, is bringing it to pass that American art of the present day is ignored, and that American painters are left to languish in New York apartments with barely the few thou- sands per annum necessary to pay their modest The Point ol   ic-w roil.

The honor paid to Mr. Redfield s  February  announces the end of the probationary period of our landscape. Our rocks and rills should be duly grateful to him. Let me repeat that this  esthetic migration of subjects is a chapter of art as interesting as it is neglected. I can only note how the Flemings and Diirer filled Italy, and even Spain, with the castellated walls, stepped gables, and channelled alluvial plains of the north; how Claude made the receding amber hills of sunset Italy European coin; how Everdingen and Ruysdael gave to the world the foaming, bowlder-studded river-courses of lower Scandinavia. So Constable imposed upon the world the dense oaks, lush river pastures, and drenched skies of Suffolk. In our day the French have made us all intimates of the rugged forest of Fontainebleau, of the poplar- lined rivers of the Seine valley, and the sweeps of green chalk pasture down by the Norman sea, while the Scandinavians, abetted by our own painters, have conquered artistic standing for bristling firs, sparkling glaciers, and velvety fields of snow. It seems to me that the time has come when we too shall contribute from our landscape something specific and valuable to the world, and this implies for ourselves a more keen and affectionate enjoyment of a land that has received the classic consecration of art. We often say loosely that a picture has been  bought by the Luxembourg.  As a matter of fact this gallery buys nothing, but exists merely as a centre of exhibition and distribu- tion. The French Ministry of Fine Arts, in accordance with long precedent, purchases every year a number of works from the chief exhibitions, and these acquisitions are disposed of chiefly through the staff of the Luxembourg Gallery. It is thus in the odd and not wholly enviable position of a museum that does not control its own buying a fact that criticism has not always remembered. The Luxem- bourg maintains a permanent, if slightly chang- ing, exhibition of modem art. It distributes many of the ministerial purchases to provincial galleries, some immediately, others after tem- porary exhibition at Paris. Finally, and surely its most important function, by a sort of proba- tionary ordeal, extending usually over a genera- tion, it sifts out of the current production the comparatively few works that prove themselves worthy of promotion to the Louvre. This last service seems to me its most substantial one, the single one perhaps that might be imitated confidently here in America. Or if we require a nearer precedent, the Tate Gallery is suc- cessfully accomplishing a similar work of selection at London. But before advocating a limbo whence works of art shall, according to their deserts, pass to the glory of the greater museums or the ob- scurity of the country galleries, it may be well to look for a moment to the history of the Luxembourg, especially to its admitted defects, and then to our own museum situation as regards the art of to-day. Thus we may learn what part of French experience seems applica- ble to our own present needs. Like many other useful institutions, the Luxembourg was founded from an oddly indirect motive. Louis XVIII, desiring to lend prestige to the quarter in which sat his unpopular House of Peers, de- cided to establish there a gallery of modern art. This was in 1818. At that time or since, in no country but Franee could the opening of an art gallery have seemed a sound political argument. The philosophical historian of the future may judge whether the speedy expulsion of the Bourbons ensued in spite of or because of the Luxembourg Gallery. Probably it worked neither way, for until the early fifties its activi- ties were most haphazard, and naturally un- impressive. Since the expansive times of the last Bonaparte the Luxembourg has exercised a deep influence upon French art. Its defects, as its critics have not failed to point out, have been those of all bureaucratic organizations. A dependency of the Ministry of Fine Arts, its taste could hardly rise higher than that of its source. It has at all times unduly befriended the official  art of the Institute,  and for years it shut its doors inhospitably to the impression- ists and more advanced realists. Yet with all these reservations, it has sheltered much of the best art of the last fifty years, has passed on to the Louvre some of its most valued treasures, and has distributed to the provincial museums hundreds of fine works in sculpture and paint- ing. Whoever is inclined to sniff at the Luxembourg and the system it represents may do well to consider a partial list of its contri- butions to the permanent collections of the Louvre. Delacroix, Ingres, Chass riau, De- camps, Corot, Rousseau, Millet, Daubigny, Troyon, Couture, Manet, Regnault these are a few names among many that rise in the memory. The Luxembourg was friendly to that shy and exquisite genius Jean Carries and to the new and perturbing sculpture of Rodin. Iln- I '  ' - Il I . 'I Ail 1 :i "11   I I, I -   i.11     V .111- .

How many American pictures of note in their day now languish permanently on the racks, only official records could reveal. To one who believes firmly that the museums should adventure in the contemporary field the show- ing would be a most depressing one. To take one instance: How many canvasses of that erstwhile great painter Kensett does the Met- ropolitan Museum own   and how many does it exhibit  Or again, why does the Boston Museum of Fine Arts keep one-half of its paintings in storage  To do more than hint at these mysteries of the artistic charnel-house would be unpardonable. Let the mere hint suffice. Surely it would have been better if there had been some means of sifting out the merely specious from the truly excellent works if there could have been probationary galleries where the new work might prove its quality. And to-day our museums would be indeed fortunate if they received the work of recent artists only after some such fair and dignified ordeal had successfully been passed. The time, may come indeed I am confident it will  when the greater museums will decline to exhibit the work of living artists except on- some distinctly probationary basis. - v'V It is .evident, though, that we cannot hope to. naturalize so specifically French an institution as a ministerial gallery of modem art. There never can be a central gallery with official and authoritative relations extending to scores of provincial establishments. As in so many other instances, what the French do by authority we must effect informally in our good American fashion through professional comity and com- mon sense. The effect, not the form, of organ- ization is the important thing. I suppose the work of an American Luxembourg will hardly be done by any single institution. What is likely is that in every museum will be organ- ized a department for contemporary art, prefer- ably with its own galleries under their own roof. The essential thing is a full recognition of the probationary idea. Let us give over the false notion of a finality the futility of which we must prudently conceal in our junk-rooms. A few years ago we had the unedifying spectacle of an American public gallery brought to the tribunal for selling what in its day had passed for a great picture. We have come to a maturity, I be- lieve, where we can afford to put away certain sly childish tricks. Let us cease coddling the artist by premature museum honors. Let us acknowledge that all contemporary judg- ments are highly fallible, and time the surest court of appeal. By buying modern work on probation we insure against its being for- gotten and give it its chance to survive. Evi- dently no artist who shrinks from facing the verdict of a few years deserves a short cut to the abodes of the old masters. If the museums were to treat modern art in this spirit, the very practical question would soon arise what is to be done with the works that are not promoted to the permanent museums  Within limits, certain of these objects might be placed on indefinite loan in newer and smaller museums. But obviously the policy of favoring the provinces with the failures of the capitals might in the long run become unpopular. It should be recalled, how- ever, that the value of exhibited works of art is highly relative. Every locality is justly inter- ested in its own artists, and a considerable clearance of the accumulations at the larger .galleries might be effected simply by distribut- ing Jo the proper centres the works that fairly belong there. So might be built up interesting   I6cal fcollections. In short, many pictures have i a.jv due.as record which, they lack as art. A '-residuum of matter artistically unavailable there would always be. For this there re- ' mains as a last resort the store-room. But here, too, the principle of relativity would bring relief. Works of historical import might be lent to historical museums or appropriate pub- lic buildings. Indeed, there are few pictures so hopeless that in some place they may not have a certain decorative value. Many a public corridor would be the more attractive for the mellowed mediocrities that now repose perdus in museum store-rooms. I believe that some such circulation of pictures is already practised. If it were merely extended and systematized we should have all that is essential in the distributing function of the Luxembourg. The important lesson which that institution has for us is that the perplexing  ' difficult task of sifting out the best work of contemporary artists should be undertaken not in a definitive but in an experimental spirit, and by an es- pecial organization free to indulge in generous audacities since its enthusiasms are to be re- vised by that wisest of appellate judges, Father Time.

On February 1st, the E. Howard Watch Works dis- continued the making of the $35 grade of Howard Watch. We have here a compact organization of highly skilled watch-men. It takes a long time to perfect a Howard Watch cased, timed, permanently adjusted "seasoned  for a lifetime of service. In its sixty-five years of history the making of a Howard Watch has never been slighted or hurried. There are never quite enough Howards to go round. Oi' late the demand is such rhat we are compelled to con- centrate on the finer movements. As necessity demands we will gradually discontinue the less expensive grades thereby raising the average quality-standard of the Howards in use and incidentally increasing the value of his investment to every Howard owner wherever he may be. A Howard Watch is always worth what you pay for it. The price of each Howard is fixed at the factory and a printed ticket attached from the 17-jewel 'double roller escapement i in a  Jas. Boss  or  Crescent  gold-filled case at $40.00 to the 23-jewel in a 14-k solid gold case at $150. E. Howard Watch Works Boston, Mass.

That was thousands of years nun   and the lamp was only a myth. But so wonderful that the story has endured to this day. The Bell telephone is far more won- derful   and it is"a reality. It is the dream of the ayes, come true. In the office, in the home, it stands ; as commonplace in appearance as Alad- din s lamp. By it the human voice the truest ex- pression of personality, ability, and char- acter   is carried from place to place in- stantly and accurately. And human powers are thus extended as if by magic. All i'ther means of cimmunication are cold and colorless m comparison. By the telephone alone is the human quality of the human voice earned beyond the limitations of unaided hearing. The Bell System has provided this wonderful faculty for all the people. The whole country is brought together by the Bell policy of universal service; and the miracle of telephone talk is repeated six billion times a year. The Bell Long Distance telephone puts a man in inti- mate touch with new resources, new possibilities. One Policy, One System, Universal Service   these make every Bell Telephone the Center of the System.

True, we have some fashionable moralities, hut nut even those who practice them would seriously defend the point of view which makes them matters of fashion. Fashion does not take account of time or place or circum- stance; it is arbitrary. It is based, not upon the fitness of things, nor upon permanent canons of taste, but on caprice. Its very essence is change it is the chosen expression of the ephemeral. For style in furniture there is much to be said. Style indicates design, character and period. Great furniture, in quite the same degree as great architecture or the other arts far from being the expression of mere pass- ing fancy  is the utterance of great men, great races and great epochs. Co'ucciu Cabinet-    ork represents permanent style, not passing fashion. It is built on lines w hich time has approved and which mere fashion can not change. In design it is the product of the  golden periods  of furniture designing in construction it is superior to any furniture of the past. It is furniture to live with and to get acquainted and to pass along to those w ho are worthy of it. other furniture just like it.

Permanency and protection to tlie surface covered are of first importance. The variation of color should be taken care of only after these are assured.  L Pure white lead and linseed oil are the recognized basic necessities of paint. Why  Because they form a periect union and, when mixed, have the quality of penetrating the sur- face covered and becoming a part of it. Such paint never cracks or scales. It wears down uniformly and the surface is ready for repaint- ing without scraping or any preparation other than brushing off the dust.  L Use National Lead Company s pure white lead   Dutch Boy Painter  trademark , have it mixed with pure linseed oil, and your painting must be economical because it will last. It will also be beautiful. Ask the painter who takes pride in his profession if this is not true. He knows.  L National Lead Company s pure white lead is the best known and enjoys the largest sale in the world. It is exactly what we say it is pure white lead containing no chalk, barytes or any oi those other subtle adulterants which make painting an expense.

They are the famous Lily Pattern made bv Wm. Rogers   Son made in their Extra Plate especially for Armour   Company. You will find spoons of the same grade, but not the pattern, in all stores, priced at $3 or more for the six. They are free to our customers, so don't go with- out them. The spoons we send you will bear your initial. They have, of course, no advertising on them. Send us one paper certificate from under the top of a jar of Armour s Extract of Beef. Else send the metal top itself. Send with it ten cents the cost of carriage and packing. We will then send you one of the spoons. Send more certificates as you get them and send ten cents with each either in silver or stamps. For each certificate or top we will send you a spoon until you get enough for a set. We 11 send all of one kind, or assort them as you prefer. If you don t want spoons we'll send butter spreaders. Thus we return to you, for a little time, more than you pay for the Extract of Beef. But we know that six jars will make you a con- vert. Then vou 11 never keep house without it. You don t know what it means the use of Ex- tract of Beef. The Germans and the French use fifty times as much as Americans. 1 heir fame as good cooks comes, in rather large part, from their meth- ods of using beef extract. They use it to utilize left-overs. 1 hey use it in a hundred ways. They make then wonderful soups with it.  Sfrrrrours Extract of Beef is most economical. It goes four times as far as other extracts. But the Extract itself will teach you these facts better than we can in print. So we ask you to buy one jar and send us the certificate with the ten cents   the cost of carriage and packing. Do this again and again, if you are satisfied. Our usual limit is 6 to a family, but we will keep the offer open until you get I 2 if you want them. Order a jar now from your drug- gist or grocer.

Try this experiment: Take several sheets of writing paper with carbons between; place them on a flat surface and drop a lead pencil, point down, from a height of 18 or 20 inches. Note the clearness of the dot, even on the bottom sheet. Now make a dot by pressing the pencil into the paper, and then examine your carbon copies. The top one will show clear enough but the others will be faint and blurred. Monarch Toich This simple demonstration illustrates the light touch principle of the Monarch Typewriter. The action of ihe Creeping Fulcrum of the Monarch typebar is such that it throws the type face against the paper with a quick tap not a slow push. This means clear impressions on the maximum number of carbon copies. Monarch  Light Touch  is more than a mere talking point. It is a mechanical fact, and is one of the exclusive features of the Monarch Typewriter. We are always glad to demonstrate this and other valuable features of the Monarch, and request those interested to write us for illustrated, descriptive literature. We can arrange fur a demonstration of the Monarch in your own office. The MonarchTypewriterCompany Monarch Typewriter Building 300 Broadway, New York Canadian Offices: Toronto: Montreal.

So it seems that it was largely a matter of mood.  3   Life insurance avoids the uncertainty of leaving things to the neighbors. It is a business plan, founded on the laws of mathematics and sound economy, to provide for those depend- ent upon us in case of death.  2  Life insurance is no longer charity, or quasi- aitruism, any more than fire insurance is.  2  Life insurance is a duty, and it is a privilege. .JS To eliminate the distressing results of death, through insur- ance, payable to business partners, wife or children, seems but common pru- dence.  2  Lord Nelson in his will left his wife and daughter   to the tender care of the Bntish Nation, to which 1 have given my life." And the wife and daughter gravitated to the poor house; for what is everybody s business is nobody s business. ,2  Don't leave your loved ones to the care of the public or the neighbors. The neighbors may have troubles of their own. Cut out risk, accident and worry, by life insurance. .2  There are no microbes in a life insurance policy.  2  Some folks cannot get life insur- ance. Possibly you cannot.  2  If so these words are not for you.

Principal Offices, Nos. 97-103 Cedar Street, New York Agents in all considerable towns The experience of this Company under iis liability policies covering 25,000 accidents a year has been studied in order to determine what in- dustrial accidents ate preventable. From such data and from data gathered from other sources, we believe that fully sixty per cent, fall within the preventable class. How these accidents mav be prevented is told in a pamphlet of about 200 pages, prepared by 11s. A hi st edition of thirty thousand copies has been exhausted. A copy has been sent without charge to each of the Company s industrial policy-holders. A second edition nf twentv thousand copies is now in press. The price to the public is nominal, twenty-five cents. A copy will lie sent on receipt of remittance.

Principal and Interest paid promptly.  IFor  he investor the first test of anv particular bond is not the security behind it, hut the reputation and record of the house behind it. 1 he Ii rst pri nciple of a reputa ble i nvtrst nient ban king house is to safeguard the interests of its clients. There is no other business in which a reputation gamed in this wav is a greater asset. No reputable banking house will sell a bond which it will not back with its own reputation which that house has not thoroughly investigated with its own experts, and pur- chased for its own account. q The success of J.

As owners of this valuable process by patent right, we have always taken a natural pride in main- taining the highest possible standard of quality. To-day Barrington Hall, the Baker-ized Steel- Cut Coffee, is used not only by people who can drink no other coffee, but by thousands who drink it merely for its splendid quality. Imitation is a consequence and an evidence of our success. Imitation, however, is confined to one part of our trade-mark,  Steel-Cut," which by a legal technicality cannot be protected. Already a host of hungry imitators, in an effort to deceive and so trade on the reputation   Steel- Cut   has gained by its connection with Barrington Hall, are using these words for coffee without reference to quality or method of preparation. If you are persuaded to try a so-called  Cut  coffee, please do not judge our coffee by it. Note free trial offer and let Barrington Hall, the only genuine steel-cut coffee, speak for itself on your own table. ------  Sealed by us. Opened by you.

Therefore, in selecting the Angelus, Kiiii  Edward made his choice from all of the piano-players of the world which could make any claim whatsoever for consideration.
