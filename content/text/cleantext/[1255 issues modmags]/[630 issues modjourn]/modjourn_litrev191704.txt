VOLIIIAPRIL 1917 NO10IMary MacLaneWHEN I heard that there was to be a new Mary MacLane book I was full of excitementremembering vaguely her first book What has the world done to you I thought as I went rapidly and curiously through the pagesI came upon parts that made me more excitedHas she made poetry has she made literatureThen I read it through properly from first to lastIt seems to me that Mary MacLane s Diary of Human Days is the best answer in the world to all those people who hold that to express yourself completely and sincerely is to have to created ArtMary MacLane says So I write this book of Me my Soulmy Heartmy sentient Bodymy magic Mindtheir potentialities and contradictions Aside from the storywhich is a sort of Spoon River of thoughtsemotionsrebellionsunconventionalitieshumorthe writing of those parts which promised to be poetry in the whole became a top pretty prettinessa kind of LadiesHome JournalnessThere is a way some maiden ladies hold a brush when painting still life we call it Spencerianbut what makes me the most weary is the tape worm wordsFeel of my Fingersmy Boredom of the Momentetc etcIt is an amusing bookIt is an unhappy bookand it is surprising in all kinds of waysIt is chiefly surprising because it is not the contradictions that contradictit is the potentialitiesthe affirmationsWhatever she affirms in the letter that she is artistpaganradicaloutlawhumoristshe denies in the spiritShe is really a rather set little conservative with a Presbyterian conscienceShe is an interesting and entertaining neuresthenicHer book is surprisingly ungrownsurprisingly commonplaceIt is surprisingly not a surpriseShe makes much talk of her old soulworn by long cycles of time she names herself an artist a double title to a universal consciousnessand then proceeds to analyze toward a universal consciousnessShe lovingly cherishes her free analytical mind and then in chapters likeI am somewaythe Lesbian womanandI am not Respectable nor Refined nor in Good Tasteshe refutes her free analytical mind in the best manner of thegood non analytic creatures I cannot find the interest to a free mindto any thinking mindin questioning the refinement of the natural feelings induced by a shower bath in the solitude of a mountain gorgeA grown mind does not consider whether it is unrefined to be natural or expect that it ought tofeeltimoroussexlessor hygenicunder such circumstancesA grown mind does not question the integrity of its emotions IMary MacLanc is good fun to read and there is enough charm in its abrupt realism to make up for its cloying fancifulnessIt is annoying and exasperating annoying because it makes you feel sorry for Mary MacLane and exasperating because it makes you wish you could help her clear up the design a bit It is too personalIt is an intrusionThe artist reveals not how he lives but how he Existsnot his objects but himselfAnd if he chooses himself as his objectas Mary MacLane has donehe has not made his task any different or less difficultIt is as foolish to talk about the artist as the man as to talk about Art as lifeWhether an artist tells out his whole soul in a single verse or in great creations through a long life timeor only exists fully and no one has known how he passed one of hishuman days what he has created will tell forever how he ExistedIt is never what life does to the artistit is what the artist does to lifeMary MacLane has created nothingShe has given us an anatomical drawing of her lifehas wistfully told her story with some imaginationsome beauty of phrasesome poetical conceptionswith honestysinceritywith the humor of a martyrThe newspapers will take it upit will be praised and jeered and quoted by wits and half witsmoral fossils will refuse to sell it and others to read itLady Writers will sayshe has made a contribution to literature She has made a contributionbut it would seem rather to the sexual theoryThe Little Review 3 To day It is the edge of a somber July night in this ButteMontanaThe sky is overcastThe nearer mountains are gray melancholyAnd at this point I meet me face to face I am Mary MacLaneof no importance to the wide bright world and dearly and damnably important to meFace to face I look at me with some hatred with despair and with great intentnessI put me in a crucible of my own making and set it in the flaming trivial Inferno of my mindAnd I assay thusI am rare I am in some ways expuisiteI am pagan within and withoutI am vain and shallow and falseI am a specialized beingdeeply myselfI am of woman sex and most things that go with thatwith some other pointesam dynamic but devastatedlaid waste in spiritI m like a leopard and I m like a poet and I m like a religieuse and I m like an outlawI have a potent weird sense of humor a caving and a demoralizing graceI have brainrerebration not powerful but fine and of a remarkable quality I am scornful tempered and I am braveI am slender in body and

Margaret CAndersonWe will probably be suppressed for this The Little Review Isadore Duncan s Misfortune Margaret CAnderson IT is impossible to write about the art of Isadora DuncanShe has no connection with that mysterious phenomenonNowpleaseall you people who put us down as aesthetes or shallow cultists or youth rebelling for the sake of sensationor tiresome upholders of artprinciples or sapless supporters of art as ahole and corneraffairplease for a momentjust listenIf you get enraged with the censorship of the vicious MrSumner every one knows it is not because you wish to flaunt your theories of good literature to the heavens for the want of something better to doVery wellGrant me the same sincerityAnd grant me also another thingthat I may possibly have something true to sayI have waited five years to see Isadora DuncanI went to the Metropolitan expecting to see the Dionysian the feet of the Centaur trampling the stage etcI expected inspiration in a form that you are lucky enough to experience a very few times in your lifeEverybody had talked to me this way about Isadora Duncanevery poetpaintersculptor and musicianevery radical I knowhad said She has real greatness Wellthis is what I sawIsadora Duncan ran jumped and skipped and stamped and swooned about the stagedragging with her a body that was never meant to move in rhythmic lineturning music into stories of war and religionillustrating the stories with obvious gesticulations toward the heavens or maudlin manouverings towards the graveusing the same gestures for the sweetness of Schubert as for the sacraments of Cesar Franckmoving always inside the musicnever dominating itnever even controlling itnever holding or pushing it to an authentic endIn all my life I have never felt such disappointment of such a weary knowledge of the public s predilection for what is truly badIt didn t occur to me to conceal these ideasI tried to explain what was wrongI used Isadora Duncan as the best example I knew of the differentiation between the artist and the pseudo artistI tried to show how her conception of Art was identical with only one other conception in the worldthe dream of the adolescent brainthat to feel greatly is to make Art and to put your passion and your anguish into expression is to createIsadora felt a great dealShe shook her head and arms in such a fury of feeling that she appeared to be stranglingand when there was no way of reaching a further intensification she shook her whole 6 The Little Review body in a kind of spasm of human inability to bear the grief of the worldAnd every move was a futile and pitiable one because never once did her body become that mould through which a design is to shape its course and flow into its ultimate formIf the music made a wide swinging curve she made a cramped sudden curveif it made a descending line she interpreted thatfor some mysterious reasonby reverently clutching her abdomen and looking to God Oh they say you are talking about technique NononoI am not talking about techniqueI am almost never talking techniqueYvette Guilbert has so little voice that she couldn t sustain the singing of a single song through with beauty as we commonly speak of beautyYet every time she moves her hand or turns her bird like head or throws that voice into the creation of her design she shows herself an artist in the one real sense of the wordIs that a matter of techniqueCezanne studied light until he was able to paint objects as though they were reflected in a kind of eternal lightIs that merely techniqueHarold Bauer studied sound until he has made the technique of the older pianists sound not like an endnor even like a means to an endbut merely like a lack of full visionWhat do you call thatJames Joyce writes a novel in which a new kind of literary architecture is achieved not by his following of but by his departure from what has been established as the technique of good writingWhat do you call that Wellthen says MrJohn Cowper Powyswhen we argue all this you are at faultWhenever you allow any theory of art to interfere with your enjoyment you are doing a silly thing But why should it occur to you that I am doing that Is it the obtrudance of an obstinate art theory that makes you acclaim the poetry of Byron quite second rate poetry compared to that of Shelley or KeatsYou would not say that your esoteric art principles interfered with your enjoyment of MrKiplingbut that MrKipling interfered with your enjoyment of what might have been his artIsadora herself interferes with the possibility of any aesthetic experience out of her dancingWhat she does is to inspire the mob with the only kind of feeling the mob is ever inspired withIf you were much moved by what she suggested to youthe trampling feet of the Centaurthe look in her face as though she could drink bloodwhy not realize that you can feel those thingsif you feel like itin the performance of the cheapest amateurAlmost no expression of the arts is too decadent to give you such reactionsBut that is no criterion of ArtIn fact the more of those feelings you have the more you will know that what you are viewing is not ArtBecause in the presence of the latter you feel almost nothingyou imagine nothingyou are like a being in vacuuo your mind in that mysterious instant Shelley likened beautifully to a fading coal So you are talking only of what Isadora made you feelnot what Isadora madeAnd the bestperhaps the only test for Art is that your emotion is focused on the forms in the picturenot sidetracked to what those forms suggest to you or inform you of as in descriptive painting or any other bad expressionClive Bell has said all this and said it more than lucidlyWhy should I be repeating itYou all believe itand all your shrines are built to this one miracleSo you must not insist to us that Isadora Duncan is an artistThis generation can t be fed on any such stuffWe are tired of that kind of loose valuationWe all know and share the debt the world owes Isadora Duncanand which the Russian Ballet acknowledged and put to a use she herself could not doBut you should not force us into a position where it positively takes courage to stand up for those values which you yourselves believe inIsadora Duncanas you will know after seeing her onceis a woman of small intelligencea monument of undirected adolescent visionan ingrained sentimentalistThe spectacle of her dancing draped in an American flag is bad enoughbut her unconsciousness of hoWemotion must be transmuted through a significant medium is to me far more sadA solf liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft loud vowels hurtled noiselessly and fe l awaylapping and flowing back and ever shaking the white bells of their waves in mute chime and mute peal and soft swooning cryand he felt that the augury he had sought in the wheeling darting birds and in the pale space of sky above him had come forth from his heart like a bird from a turrent quietly and swiftlyDarkness was falling A trembling joylambent as a faint lightplayed like a fairy host around himBut whyHer passage through the darkening air or the verse with its black vowels and its opening soundrich and lutelike From James Joyce sPortrait of the Artist As A Young Man 8 The Little Review James Joyce I SUPPOSE MrJoyce had some idea in mind when he gave his book the title of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young ManBut the critics seem to want it their own way and say MrJoyce paints the Irishman as he really is IrishmandoctorlawyermerchantchiefI supposeFrancis Hackett says itreveals the inevitable malaise of serious youth Why then doesn t this inevitable malaise of all our serious youth end inevitably like thisthe callto create proudly out of the freedom and power of his soula living thingnew and soaringand beautifulimpalpableimperishable HGWells assures us that the youth of his country need not suffer such tortures of adolescence because of England s more common sense treatment of the sex questionAnd all the time MrJoyce was talking about the artist of any landnot the youth of England or any other countryIn this country there is only God to thank that the young artist does not go entirely mad over one and all of its institutionsIn our country the young artists could suffer tortures far beyond anything suffered by Stephenover the utter emptiness of the placeBut he will always sufferHe will always bea naked runner lost in a storm of spears There is too much geography of the body in this education of oursYou can talk about or write about or paint or sculp some parts of the body but others must be treated like the Bad LandsYou can write about what you see that you don t likewhat you touchtasteor hearbut you can t write about what you smellif you do you are accused of using nasty wordsI could say a lot more about the geography of the bodyand how its influence goes all the way through until the censor makes a geography for your mind and soulBut I want to talk about nasty wordsThe result of this education is that we have all the nasty words in the world in our languageHow often a European or an Oriental will say Ohto us it is something very nice beautifulbut to you it would not be niceit is much different in English When they told James Joyce he had words like that in his book he must have been as surprised as a painter would be if he were told that some of his colors were immoralHis story is told the way a person in a sick room sharply remembers all the over felt impressions and experiences of a time of feveruntil the storyA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Manby James JoyceNew York BWHuebschThe Little Review 9 itself catches the fever and becomes a thing of more definitecloser knownkeener felt consciousness and of a restless oblivion of self consciousnessjhThis James Joyce book is the most beautiful piece of writing and the most creative piece of prose anywhere to be seen on the horizon to dayIt is consciously a work of Art in a way that Jean Christophe made no effort to beit is such head and shoulders above Jacob Stahl or Gilbert Cannan s Mendel that one must realize those books as very good novels and this as something quite more than thatIt can be spoken of in terms that apply to Pelle the Conquerorbut only in this wayeach is a work of Art and therefore not to be talked of as lesser or greaterbut while Pelle is made of language as it has been used the Portrait is made of language as it will come to be usedThere is no doubt that we will have novels before long written without even as much of the conventional structure of language as MrJoyce has adhered to a new kind ofdimension in languagewhich is being felt in many places and which George Soule has illustrated beautifully in an article in The New RepublicBut that isn t the most important thingThe interest in Pelle is in the way its stories are toldThe interest in the Portrait is in the way its aesthetic content is presentedFor instancethese fragmentsHe thought his face must be white because it felt so coolHe could not get out the answer for the sum but it did not matterWhite roses and red rosesthose were beautiful colours to think ofAnd the cards for first place and third place were beautiful colours toopink and cream and lavenderLavender and cream and pink roses were beautiful to think ofPerhaps a wild rose might be like those colours and he remembered the song about the wild rose blossoms on the little green placeRut you could not have a green roseBut perhaps somewhere in the world you couldThe corridors were darkly lit and the chapel was darkly litSoon all would be dark and sleepingThere was cold night air in the chapel and the marbles were the colour the sea was at nightIt was cold and dark under the seawall beside his father s houseThe Little Review There was a cold night smell in the chapelBut it was a holy smellIt was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at the back of the chapel at Sunday massThat was a smell of air and rain and turf and corduroyBut they were very holy peasants It would be lovely to to sleep for one night in that cottage before the fire of smoking turfin the dark lit by the firein the warm darkbreathing the smell of the peasantsair and rain and turf and corduroyThe altar was heaped with fragrant masses of white flowersand in the morning light the pale flames of the candles among the white flowers were clear and silent as his own soulThe air of the late March evening made clear their flighttheir dark quivering bodies flung clearly against the sky as against a limp hung cloth of smoky tenuous blueHe watched their flightbird after birda dark flasha swervea flutter of wingsHe tried to count them before all their darting quivering bodies passedSixtenelevenand wondered were they odd or even in numberTwelvethirteenfor two came wheeling down from the upper skyThey were flying high and low but

noteBut the notes were long and shrill and whirringunlike the cry of verminfalling a third or a fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove the airTheir cry as shrill and clear and fine and falling like threads of silken light unwound from whirring spoolsA soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters flowed over his memory and he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent spaces of fading tenuous sky above the watersof oceanic silenceof swallows flying through the seadusk over the flowing watersMC AThe Little Review 11 The Vers Libre Contest AT last after many months the prize contest has been decidedI know very little about prize contestsbut I imagine that there has never been one in the history of poetry which could boast so many really bad poemsPersonally I think there are not more than four or five with any suggestion of poetry in themthe rest are either involuntarily humorouslike the one printed at the endor pompously anacronistic like the one which asks Shall I with frantic hands unloose the cord that binds me to this life The judges were Eunice TietjensHelen Hoytand William Carlos WilliamsThey came to no unanimous decision as to which two poems were the bestand

maidenlie by the windy oceanDreaming of quiet waters Guarded by willows DrWilliams s first choice was The Master for the reason that it has most imaginative charm while possessing at the same time a fairly even unity of rhythma simple straight forward diction and a very subtle depth of thoughtThe image is progressively developed to a fine and natural conclusion with great simplicity and restraintwithout waste of materiawithout redundancy of any kind 14 The Little Review What or where is the subtle depth of thoughtAlmost every kind of person in the world has had this thoughtit is not

spirited and well constructed defiance I think it is a very trite effort one of those loose though rather happy expressions of mood that has no more to do with art than a man s exclamationthat he
