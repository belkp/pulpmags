valleys full of winding roads Fork out to south and north  There is a place of trees gray with lichen I have walked there thinking of old days At Chalais  is a pleached arbor Old pensioners and old protected women Have the right there  it is charity I have crept over old rafters peering down   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Over the Dronne over a stream full of lilies Eastward the road lies  Aubeterre is eastward With a garrulous old man at the inn I know the roads in that place Mareuil to the north east  La Tour There are three keeps near Mareuil And an old woman  glad to hear Arnaut Glad to lend one dry clothing  I have walked  into Perigord I have seen the torch flames high leaping Painting the front of that church And under the dark whirling laughter I have looked back over the stream  and seen the high building Seen the long minarets the white shafts I have gone in Ribeyrac  and in Sarlat I have climbed rickety stairs heard talk of Croy Walked over En Bertran s old layout Have seen Narbonne and Cahors and Chains Have seen Excideuil carefully fashioned   Provincia Déserta  I have said Here such a one walked Here Coeur de Lion was slain Here was good singing Here one man hastened his step Here one lay panting I have looked south from Hautefort thinking of Montaignac southward I have lain in Rocafixada level with sunset Have seen the copper come down  tinging the mountains I have seen the fields pale clear as an emerald Sharp peaks high spurs distant castles I have said The old roads have lain here Men have gone by such and such valleys Where the great halls are closer together I have seen Foix on its rocks seen Toulouse and Arles greatly  altered I have seen the ruined Dorata I have said Riquier Guido  I have thought of the second Troy Some little prized

Stepping beneath a boisterous wind from Thrace Throughout this sylvan place Spreads the bright tips And every vine stock is Clad in new brilliancies  And wild desire Falls like black lightning O bewildered heart Though every branch have back what last year lost She who moved here amid the cyclamen Moves only now a clinging tenuous ghost  THE COMING OF WAR ACTAEON  An image of Lethe and the

Ezra Pound   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  EXILE S LETTER  From the Chinese of Rihaku Li Po usually considered the greatest poet of China written by him while in exile about 760 A D to the Hereditary War Councillor of Sho recollecting former companionship  So Kin of Rakuho ancient friend I now remember That you built me a special tavern By the south side of the bridge at Ten Shin With yellow gold and white jewels  we paid for the songs and laughter And we were drunk for month after month forgetting the kings and princes Intelligent men came drifting in from the sea and from the west border And with them and with you especially there was nothing at cross purpose And they made nothing of sea crossing  or of mountain crossing If only they could be of that fellowship And we all spoke out our hearts and minds   and without regret And then I was sent off to South Wei  smothered in laurel groves And you to the north of Raku hoku Till we had nothing but thoughts and memories between us And when separation had come to its worst We met and travelled together into Sen Go   Exile s Letter  Through all the thirty six folds of the turning and twisting waters Into a valley of a thousand bright flowers that was the first valley And on into ten thousand valleys full of voices and pine winds With silver harness and reins of gold  prostrating themselves on the ground Out came the East of Kan foreman and his company And there came also the True man of Shi yo to meet me Playing on a jewelled mouth organ In the storied houses of San Ko they gave us  more Sennin music Many instruments like the sound of young phoenix broods And the foreman of Kan Chu drunk Danced because his long sleeves Wouldn t keep still with that music playing And I wrapped in brocade went to sleep with my head on  his lap And my spirit so high that it was all over the heavens  And before the end of the day we were scattered like stars  or rain I had to be off to So far away over the waters You back to your river bridge And your father who was brave as a leopard Was governor in Hei Shu and put down the barbarian rabble   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And one May he had you send for me despite the long distance And what with broken wheels and so on I won t say it  wasn t hard going Over roads twisted like sheep s guts And I was still going late in the year  in the cutting wind from the north And thinking how little you cared for the cost   and you caring enough to pay it Then what a reception Red jade cups food well set on a blue jewelled table And I was drunk and had no thought of returning And you would walk out with me to the western corner of  the castle To the dynastic temple with the water about it clear as blue jade With boats floating and the sound of mouth organs and drums With ripples like dragon scales going grass green on the water Pleasure lasting with courtezans going and coming without  hindrance With the willow flakes falling like snow And the vermilioned girls getting drunk about sunset And the waters a hundred feet deep reflecting green eye  brows Eyebrows painted green are a fine sight in young moonlight   Exile s Letter  Gracefully painted and the girls singing back at each other Dancing in transparent brocade And the wind lifting the song and interrupting it Tossing it up under the clouds  And all this comes to an end And is not again to be met with I went up to the court for examination Tried Layu s luck offered the Choyu song And got no promotion And went back to the East Mountains white headed  And once again we met later at the South Bridge head And then the crowd broke up you went north to San palace And if you ask how I regret that parting It is like the flowers falling at spring s end  confused whirled in a tangle What is the use of talking And there is no end of talking There is no end of things in the heart  I call in the boy Have him sit on his knees to write and seal this And I send it a thousand miles thinking  Rihaku Li Po  Translated by Ezra Pound from the notes of the late Ernest Fenollosa and the decipherings of the Professors Mori and Araga   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  LIADAIN TO CURITHIR  Liadain and Curithir were two poets who lived in Ireland in the seventh century They fell in love but while Curithir was absent making preparations for their marriage Liadain for some unexplained reason took the vows of a nun Curithir in despair became a monk At first they continued to see each other but when this led to the breaking of their vows Curithir left Liadain to spend his life in penance and thus save his soul  I  If I had known how narrow a prison is love Never would I have given the width of the skies In return for thy kiss O Curithir thou my grief  If I had known love s poverty I would have given Duns and forests and ploughlands and begged my bread For now I have lost the earth and the stars and my soul  If I had known the strength of love I would have laid The ridge of the world in ashes to stay his feet I would have cried on a stronger lord on Death  II  I that was wont to pass by all unmoved As the long ridge of the tide sweeps to the shore Am broken at last on the crags of a pitiless love   Liadain to Curithir  I who was wont to see men pale at my glance Like the quivering grass am shaken beneath thine eyes At thy touch my spirit is captive my will is lost  I would darken the sun and moon to break from thy love I would shatter the world to win thee again to my side O aching madness of love Have the dead repose Or wilt thou tear my heart in the close shut grave  III  I have done with blame I have risen from the cold earth Where night and day my forehead has known the clay With faltering steps I have passed out to the sun  Now in the sight of all I stand that all may know For I myself will praise thee and prove their words How great was thy wisdom in turning away from me  Who that has drunken wine will keep the lees Who that has slain a man will wait for revenge Who that has had his desire of a woman will stay  Farewell O Curithir let thy soul be saved I have not found a thing that is dearer to thee In the eyes of God is it priceless Who can say   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  My soul is a thing of little worth unto God Of less worth unto thee O Curithir than my love And unto me so small I flung it beneath thy feet  IV  If the dark earth hold a Power that is not God I pray It to bind up memory lest I die  There was a day when Curithir loved me now it is gone It was I that sundered his love from me I myself Or it was God who struck me with madness and mocked  If the dark earth hold a Power that is not God I pray It to hide me for ever away from His face  V  All things are outworn now grief is dead And passion has fallen from me like a withered leaf Little it were to me now though Curithir were beside me Though he should pass I would not turn my head My heart is like a stone in my body All I have grasped I loose again from my hands  Moireen Fox   POEMS  THE WIND SLEEPERS  Whiter than the crust left by the tide we are stung by the hurled sand and the broken shells  We no longer sleep sleep in the wind We awoke and fled through the Peiraeic gate  Tear tear us an altar Tug at the cliff boulders pile them with the rough stones We no longer sleep in the wind Propitiate us  Chant in a wail that never halts Pace a circle and pay tribute with a song  When the roar of a dropped wave breaks into it   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  pour meted words of sea hawks and gulls and sea birds that cry discords  STORM I  You crash over the trees you crack the live branch the branch is white the green crushed each leaf is rent like split wood  II  You burden the trees with black drops you swirl and crash you have broken off a weighted leaf in the wind it is hurled out whirls up and sinks a green stone  THE POOL  Are you alive I touch you with my thumb   The Pool  You quiver like a sea fish I cover you with my net What are you banded one  THE GARDEN  I  You are clear O rose cut in rock  I could scrape the color from the petals like spilt dye from a rock  If I could break you I could break a tree  If I could stir I could break a tree I could break you  II  O wind rend open the heat cut apart the heat slit it to tatters   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  Fruit cannot drop through this thick air fruit cannot fall into heat that presses up and blunts the points of pears and rounds grapes  Cut the heat plough through it turning it on either side of your path  MOONRISE  Will you glimmer on the sea Will you fling your spear head on the shore What note shall we pitch  We have a song on the bank we share our arrows the loosed string tells our note  O flight bring her swiftly to our song She is great lue measure her by the pine trees  H D   IN AN OLD LODGING HOUSE  Old house old room what do you think of me And all my little windy smiles and tears My easy woe and easier ecstasy Old house old room who know the falling years  I wonder if my loneliness is strange To you tall windows free with night and day Who else has loved the seasons lingering change Across the courts and roofs What eyes more gay  Have glanced through you nor watched the moon too well Because they sought some face less cold and far What feet upon your wornout thresholds fell More light more daring than my dull feet are  Or oh what passionate sorrow may have swept From wall to wall and shaken them like cloth What weary wounded arrogance has kept A blundering watch here like a wing scorched moth  Has Death lain here maybe all night all night Where I in ruddy restlessness do lie The folded hands the lips so smiling white O room what wind of Fate has lashed you high   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Upon the wave of tragedy and tears  And I sit here and write such foolish things  Old house old room who know the falling years  How faint must be my gloom and gloryings  TONIGHT  My mother died when I was young Yet not too young to know What terror round the dark halls clung That aching day of snow  I knew she could not comfort me I sat there all alone Cold sorrow held me quietly Dumb as a snow hid stone  And yet I seemed to watch it all As in a picture book The silent people in the hall My father s frozen look  The heaped white roses and my dress So very black and new I watched it without weariness Ah how the snow blast blew   Tonight  Tonight you say you love me me Who leap to love you Lo I am all yours so utterly You need not speak nor show  One sign but I shall understand Out to our life s last rim Out into death s uncertain land  Gracious be it or grim  I am all yours And yet tonight The old trick haunts me Look I see your face O new delight As in a picture book  Your face your shape the fire lit room The red rose on the shelf And leaning to its passionate bloom Troubled with love myself  Oh hold your hand across my eyes They have no right to see But now as then they are too wise They stare they frighten me  Fannie Stearns Davis   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE  Scherzo  Come sprite and dance The sun is up The wind runs laughing down the sky That brims with morning like a cup Sprite we must race him We must chase him You and I And skim across the fuzzy heather You and joy and I together Whirling by  You merry little roll of fat Made warm to kiss and smooth to pat And round to toy with like a cub To put one s nozzle in and rub And breathe you in like breath of kine Like juice of vine That sets my morning heart a tingling Dancing jingling All the glad abandon mingling Of wind and wine  Sprite you are love and you are joy A happiness a dream a toy A god to laugh with Love to chaff with   The Bacchante  The sun come down in tangled gold The moon to kiss and spring to hold  There was a time once long ago Long oh long since I scarcelyAlmost I had forgot There was a time when you were not You merry sprite save as a strain The strange dull pain Of green buds swelling In warm straight dwelling That must burst to the April rain A little heavy I was then And dull and glad to rest And when The travail came In searing flame But sprite that was so long ago A century I scarcely know Almost I had forgot When you were not  So little sprite come dance with me The sun is up the wind is free Come now and trip it Romp and skip it Earth is young and so are we Sprite you and I will dance together   to Her Babe  know  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  On the heather Glad with all the procreant earth With all the fruitage of the trees And golden pollen on the breeze With plants that bring the grain to birth With beast and bird Feathered and furred With youth and hope and life and love And joy thereof While we are part of all we two For my glad burgeoning in you  So merry little roll of fat Made warm to kiss and smooth to pat And round to toy with like a cub To put one s nozzle in and rub My god to laugh with Love to chaff with Come and dance beneath the sky You and I Look out with those round wondering eyes And squirm and gurgle and grow wise  Eunice Tietjens   SIX LYRICS  I AM WEARY OF BEING BITTER  I am weary of being bitter and weary of being wise And the armor and the mask of these fall from me after long I would go where the islands sleep or where the sea dawns rise And lose my bitter wisdom in the wisdom of a song  There are magics in melodies unknown of the sages The powers of purest wonder on secret wings go by Doubtless out of the silence of dumb preceding ages Song woke the chaos world and light swept the sky  All that we know is idle idle is all we cherish Idle the will that takes loads that proclaim it strong For the knowledge the strength the burden all shall perish One thing only endures one thing only song  TH E BIRDCAGE  O tragic bird whose bleeding feet Whose maddened wings dizzily beat Against your cage in agony Soon soon to win your liberty Still you believe that happiness   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Dwells just beyond the bars you press That if a sudden miracle Gave your desire life would be well The old old dream The old old lure The devil plays his stakes are sure With happiness he baits his gin That still mankind shall perish in And still we trust our hearts could be Blessed by the distant liberty Blind to the newer agony The earth will be a frozen coal Before man knows his traitor soul  DON GIOVANNI  It is not lust that leads me It is not evil drives me But beauty beauty beauty Calling afar off  Prophet and poet know my urge and torture Hermit and dreamer are my errant brothers For I am mad with unattainèd beauty Calling afar off   The fairer morrow the horizons Lighted beyond old borders The world s one savior beauty Calling afar off   Like Him Whose Spirit  LIKE HIM WHOSE SPIRIT  Like him whose spirit in the blaze of noon Still keeps the memory of one secret star That in the dusk of a remembered June Thrilled the strange hour with beauty from afar And perilous spells of twilight snare his heart And wistful moods his common thoughts subdue And life seethes by him utterly apart Last night I dreamed today I dream of you Gleams downward strike bright bubbles upward hover Through the charmed air far sea winds cool my brow Invisible lips tell me I shall discover Today a temple a mystery a vow The cycle rounds only the false seems true Last night I dreamed today I dream of you  SNOWTIME  Is it summer that you crave Swallows dipping wing Evening light across the wave Or some farther thing  Some report of happier places Golden times and lands   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  New and wonder laden faces New and eager hands  Nay you know not But I know Round you cold is furled Like this shroud of trampled snow Smothering the world  Where no trust in any spring Now can heal or save Nor the icy sunlight bring Swallows o er the wave  MEETING  Gray robed Wanderer in sleep Wanderer You also move among Those silent halls Dim on the shore of the unsailèd deep And your footfalls yours also Wanderer Faint through those twilight corridors have rung  Of late my eyes have seen Wanderer Amid the shadows gloom Of that sleep girdled place I should have known such joy could not have been   Meeting  To see your face and yet Wanderer What hopes seem vain beneath the night in bloom  Wearily I awake Wanderer Your look of old despair Like a dying star In morning vanishes But for all memories sake Though you are far tonight O Wanderer Tonight come though in silence to the shadows there  Arthur Davison Ficke POETRY A Magazine of Verse  COMMENTS AND REVIEWS  THE FIGHT FOR THE CROWD  The Book and Play Club had an editors night last month when spokesmen for various Chicago weeklies and monthlies uttered their pleas and plaints It was mostly the same story the difficulty of finding and winning over a public for art for ideas while the great headlong tolerant American crowd huddles like sheep in the droves of the commercial exploiters of this or that feature or fashion this or that impulse or interest of the hour  Also it was a confession of motives and feelings Mr Alexander Kahn loved the Little Review like a sweetheart the editor of The Dial admitted his aversion from its conventionality and one and all longed for that free enlightened weekly which shall outrank all other papers of whatever time or clime and make Chicago the centre of the earth Incidentally there were more personal confessions Mr Edgar Lee Masters for example told how the Spoon River Anthology was conceived nearly a year ago when his mind already shaken out of certain literary prejudices by the reading in POETRY of much free verse especially that of Mr Carl Sandburg was spurred to more active radicalism through a friendship with that iconoclastic champion of free speech free form free art freedom of the soul At this acknowledgment that POETRY had furnished the spark which kindled a poet s soul to living flame and burned out of it the dry refuse of formalism this editor in her corner felt a thrill of   The Fight for the Crowd  pride and a sudden warmth of unalterable conviction that whatever may happen to the magazine now or later its work can never be counted vain  After POETRY The Little Review The Dial Drama etc had confessed bitter struggles to keep above water we were patted on the head and condescendingly put in our place as uplift magazines by one of the numerous popular monthlies which though no one ever hears of them go out from Chicago to eager millions We don t turn over our hands to get subscribers said the charmingly complacent editor yet nothing can stop them after two brief years of life we have two hundred thousand thirty thousand new ones since October I fear these well meaning neighbors of mine don t give you what you want  As the audience laughed the mind of at least one editor transformed it and multiplied it by millions until it included the vast constituency of all those incredibly popular magazines I saw as in a Piers Ploughman vision the myriads of new readers stretching from sea to sea the huge easygoing American public following trampled roads gulping down pre digested foods seeking comfortable goals suspicious always of ideas of torches of climbing feet of singing voices a public which does not stone its prophets finding it more effective to ignore them  But strangely enough the vision brought instead of bitterness a deep warming of the heart Is it not the same old crowd that Langland saw the struggling suffering toilers who starve in body and mind who clutch at any straw   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of comfort and follow any casual cry who dream deep dreams which they dare not admit and cannot express who grope for beauty and truth through tinsel trickeries and smug falsities Are not the prophets one with them because the prophets each in his degree are doing the same thing plunging with such lights as they have into the darkness Indeed only the prophets are aware of what all are doing aware of the uncharted immensities against which our little human torches flicker and flare so they alone feel the urgent impulse to lift their torches high to cry aloud to reveal to lead  The crowd rebels against the universal theme of art the littleness of man or rather the abysmal contrast between his littleness and his greatness In old Chinese paintings there is always some little weazened philosopher squinting at the cataract and so in all great art stands the absurd earth bound gnome like figure of humanity facing the infinite with inadequate and unattainable dreams Deep buried in the heart of every man is some effigy of this figure but most men are afraid of it like to bury it deeper under conventional occupations sentimentalities moralities instead of permitting artists and prophets to unearth it and expose it to the pitiless light But every man s heart however perverse with ignorance however cluttered with knowledge makes a secret confession of the truth Poets and prophets therefore the beauty of art the sublimity of truth appeal to him not quite in vain and the appeal must go on so long as the race endures To the last trench and the last despair   The Renaissance  certain spirits in whom the common human spark of love becomes a flaming passion must keep up the eternal impossible fight for souls for a kingdom of heaven on earth  H M  THE RENAISSANCE II  Whether from habit or from profound intuition or from sheer national conceit one is always looking to America for signs of a renaissance One is open eyed to defects I have heard passionate nonentities rave about America s literary and artistic barrenness I have heard the greatest living American saying with the measured tones of deliberative curiosity Strange how all taint of art or letters seems to shun that continent ah ah God knows there s little enough here ah   And yet we look to the dawn we count up our symptoms year in and year out we say we have this and that we have so much and so much Our best asset is a thing of the spirit I have the ring of it in a letter now on my desk from a good but little known poet complaining of desperate loneliness envying Synge his material to wit the Arran Islands and people wishing me well with my exotics and ending with a sort of defiance For me nothing exists really exists outside America  That writer is not alone in his feeling nor is he alone in his belief in tomorrow That emotion and belief are our motive forces and as to their application we can perhaps   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  best serve it by taking stock of what we have and devising practical measures And we must do this without pride and without parochialism we have no one to cheat save ourselves It is not a question of scaring someone else but of making ourselves efficient We must learn what we can from the past we must learn what other nations have done successfully under similar circumstances we must think how they did it  We have to begin with architecture the first of the arts to arrive the most material the most dependent on the inner need of the poor for the arts are noble only as they meet the inner need of the poor Bach is given to all men Homer is given to all men you need only the faculty of music or of patience to read or to hear Painting and sculpture are given to all men in a particular place to all who have money for travel  And architecture comes first being the finest branch of advertisement advertisement of some god who has been successful or of some emperor or of some business man a material need plus display At any rate we have architecture the only architecture of our time I do not mean our copies of old buildings lovely and lovable as they are I mean our own creations our office buildings like greater campanili and so on  And we have or we are beginning to have collections We have had at least one scholar in Ernest Fenollosa and one patron in Mr Freer I mean that these two men at least have worked as the great Italian researchers and col   The Renaissance  lectors of the quattrocento worked and collected But mostly America from the White House to the gutter is still dominated by a puritanical hatred of what is beyond its understanding  So it is to the fighting minority that I speak to a minority that has been until now gradually forced out of the country We have looked to the wrong powers We have not sufficiently looked to ourselves We have not defined the hostility or inertia that is against us We have not recognized with any Voltairian clearness the nature of this opposition and we have not realized to what an extent a renaissance is a thing made a thing made by conscious propaganda  The scholars of the quattrocento had just as stiff a stupidity and contentment and ignorance to contend with It is from the biographies of Erasmus and Lorenzo Valla that we must find consolation They were willing to work at foundations They did not give the crowd what it wanted The middle ages had been a jumble There may have been a charming diversity but there was also the darkness of decentralization There had been minute vortices at such castles as that of Savairic de Maleon and later at the universities But the rinascimento began when Valla wrote in the preface of the Elegantiae  Linguam Latinam distribuisse minus erit optimam frugem et vere divinam nec corporis sed animi cibum Haec enim gentes populosque omnes omnibus artibus quae liberales vocantur instituit haec optimas leges edocuit haec warn ad omnem sapientiam munivit haec denique praestitit ne barbari amplius dici pos   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  sent In qua lingua disciplinae cunctae libero homine dlgnae continetur Linguam Romanam vivere plus quant urbem  Magnum ergo Latini sermonis sacramentum est Ibi namque Romanum imperium est ubicunque Romana lingua dominatur  That is not the revival of classicism It is not a worship of corpses It is an appreciation of the great Roman  vortex an understanding of and an awakening to the value of a capital the value of centralization in matters of knowledge and art and of the interaction and stimulus of genius foregathered Ubicunque Romana lingua dominatur  That sense that reawakening to the sense of the capital resulted not in a single great vortex such as Dante had  dreamed of in his propaganda for a great central court a peace tribunal and in all his ghibelline speculations but it did result in the numerous vortices of the Italian cities striv  ing against each other not only in commerce but in the arts as well  America has no natural capital Washington is a political machine I dare say a good enough one If we are to have an art capital it also must be made by conscious effort No city will make such effort on behalf of any other city The city that plays for this glory will have to plot deliberately to plot for the gathering in of great artists not merely as incidental lecturers but as residents She will have to plot for the centralization of young artists She will have to give them living conditions as comfortable as Paris has given since the days of Abelard   The Renaissance  The universities can no longer remain divorced from contemporary intellectual activity The press cannot longer remain divorced from the vitality and precision of an awakened university scholarship Art and scholarship need not be wholly at loggerheads  But above all there must be living conditions for artists not merely for illustrators and magazine writers not merely for commercial producers catering to what they think the public or their readers desire  Great art does not depend on the support of riches but without such aid it will be individual separate and spasmodic it will not group and become a great period The individual artist will do fine work in corners to be discovered after his death Some good enough poet will be spoiled by trying to write stuff as vendible as bath tubs or another because not willing or able to rely on his creative work he had to make his mind didactic by preparing to be a professor of literature or abstract by trying to be a professor of philosophy or had to participate in some other fiasco But for all that you will not be able to stop the great art the true art of the man of genius  Great art does not depend upon comfort it does not depend upon the support of riches But a great age is brought about only with the aid of wealth because a great age means the deliberate fostering of genius the gathering in and grouping and encouragement of artists  In my final paper of this series I shall put forth certain plans for improvement Ezra Pound   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A MODERN EPIC OF WAR  It is no wonder that Mr Thomas Hardy s dramatic epic The Dynasts is being given as a pageant in London Indeed the wonder was that during the first months of the war when every little poem on the subject was eagerly read so little was said about this big poem which stages enormously the huge tragedy of war  It is a poem both old and new More than ten years ago appeared the first volume of this dramatization of Europe disturbed the period from Napoleon s assumption of dynastic power to his defeat at Waterloo War as a kind of madness a horror a folly has for decades been preached yet this poem which is a massive symbol of this doctrine has been little read Perhaps because The Dynasts is a departure in English patriot poetry because it has none of the forced call to England s past glory of Alfred Noyes Drake nothing of Kipling s tumult and shouting disguised as prayer England finds the poem too subdued for her liking Yet as a vision or prevision of the present war The Dynasts is for here and now  There is a semblance of technical drama in this ten years of history The poet has doubled the triangle of rise climax and dénouement Napoleon as the supreme dynast completes this program from his crowning in Milan to Waterloo England his opponent acts as a counter force in her over sea fighting from Trafalgar to Waterloo This history everyone knows its very closeness to fact is all the better   A Modern Epic of War  basic substance of this symbolized monster devastation This is most vivid in the Dumb Shows which placed like parentheses on the page are really pictures of benumbing terror more subtle than those in Tolstoi s War and Peace Choruses body forth movements too vast for any stage spirits chant their pity or their resignation or their sneer at a world so ill contrived  In this pageant which is too literal to be dramatic and in this drama which is too philosophic to more than flap the wings of poesy there is a great idea If this is held to whatever is tedious in the twenty or more acts is overborne by the essential conception the gratuitous gambling in life by dynasts and the leaden cruelty of their war game To dramatize this idea Mr Hardy had to depart from the usual type of historical play There can be no hero with the halo light as in the old epics no apotheosis of personal courage as in Shakespeare s or Schiller s hero plays We see not the glory but the poor faint poesy of war we are placed behind the scenes of this poor painted show called soldiering  Tragedy in the autere sense is not possible where there are no staged heroes The bitter fate mood of tragic conflict is too fine for dynasts who drive their subjects like sheep to slaughter Napoleon is sometimes made to speak as though fate and destiny were his counsellors but his speeches are weak too imitative of the heroic manner of Shakespeare This poet has neither temperament nor philosophy for tragedy His doctrine of the individual and the race as will less   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  precludes a fight with fate His dynasts and their subjects are like Jude and Tess and Giles Winterbourne victims of eternal artistries in circumstance they know but narrow freedom they do but as they may no further dare All their movements are but an  Emerging with blind gropes from impercipience  By random sequence luckless tragic chance  Of fatalism there is plenty Ere systemed suns were globed and lit The slaughters of the race were writ And wasting war by land and sea Fixed like all else immutably  And we hear a deep complaint against some superworld which hovers over the misery of this mud molded ball  The whole drama is a presentment of a mean monstrous ironism The dynasts from the forlorn Queen Louise who begs Napoleon for Magdeburg to Napoleon himself are larger types of time s laughing stocks Irony is easily the temperament of Mr Thomas Hardy His ironic range with this great drama added to the novels is complete Life s little ironies and its big ones are never absent from his pages The sinister and the pitying voices are for this reason his strongest dramatic as well as lyric instruments in this arraignment of war W e hear their resounding complaint of the plague of rulers and the pity of the ruled  Alas what prayers will save the struggling lands  Whose lives are ninepins to these bowling hands  Nothing could be more ironical than a Peace Congress described thus    A Modern Epic of War  Where every power perpends withal Its dues as large its friends as small Till Priests of Peace prepare once more To fight as they have fought before  Picture after picture enforces the grim irony of war Soldiers of opposing armies drink from the same stream grasping hands across the rill before they take each other s lives  What more could plead the wryness of the times Than such unstudied piteous pantomimes Again are shown soldiers peacefully sleeping by the bivouac  embers There to pursue at dawn the dynasts death game Unto the ending  Humorous irony delightful in the novels is not lacking in this complete show which moves from cabinet to camp from ship to field stopping on the varied routes to allow the humblest to complain or to approve These delicious bits are in the best manner of the Wessex peasants whom Hardy can logically put into this great drama It is Wessex which is threatened with Napoleon s invasion Wessex has more than indirect part in the glory of Trafalgar It is this inherited tradition of Wessex as soldiering ground which may have urged the most intensely local of novelists into this world poem in which not Wessex but all England has a part  How is England to be glorified in a drama which cannot glorify war This I think is its great achievement that England s full due of glory is given her She is the arbiter of the great struggle Her part is becomingly sung or   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  chanted and the spirit of the verse is one with the patriot poetry of England in affirming the right of England to be arbiter but the whole tone of the drama is so uniformly in the minor key that there is not a single swashbuckling note in the verse There is no disguising that England s fighting with or against dynasts is bitter business We are spared any special adjusting of dramatic moments which might appeal to national vanity A hero like Sir John Moore wins the meed of sincere if not a melodious tear Nelson s death does not lack the sentiment appropriate to one whose life was deeply sentimental the most woeful picture of war is reserved for a remnant of the English army left to die on an island in the Scheldt in dynasts discords not their own A really epic effect is secured in the battle of Waterloo an effect beside which Victor Hugo s much quoted chapter is a burden of detail  There are choruses to sing the power of the English fleet they are simple and modest in effect for the victory of England is no occasion for shout or triumph All is restrained by a deep sense of the sacrifice which victory demands The Dynasts is thus an advance in English patriot poetry it avoids both the bombast of Rule Britannia and the apologetic whine which has crept into English patriot verse since the Boer war The English hate war no one has expressed its tragic folly so simply as Southey in a child s persistent asking What was it all about in The Battle of Blenheim Shakespeare satirized soldiering more acutely than Bernard Shaw has done And this poem of   A Modern Epic of War  England s dear bought glory should be worth much to England now that she is again paying the price of dynasts quarrels  It is worth much to all of us for the prophetic irony interpretative of the present war which meets one on every page  Behold again the Dynasts gory gear And people are enmeshed in new calamities seems to have been written yesterday As to prayer for success in battle Napoleon calls it trying to hire the enginery of heaven The transport of the English troops to Spain reads as though it were that of Lord Kitchener s men to France and these lines are ironically close to the present time England is fierce for fighting on Strange humor in a concord loving land There is a hint that nations may sometime settle their disputes by modern reason and the urbaner sense but the whole poem is so suffused with a justifiable pessimism that one heeds but little any forward looking thought that they will ever come to this At best the poem sings a kind of august pity that such a madness as war is the story of the ages To possess one great literary rendering of its stark iniquity may be a prophecy of its doom  Ellen FitzGerald   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REVIEWS  The Sharing by Agnes Lee Sherman French amp Co The Congo and Other Poems by Vachel Lindsay Macmillan  Many new books of verse provide convenient handles for the critic there are easy ready made methods of approach or obvious points of attack which the harassed reviewer would be blind indeed if he did not seize upon and expand into journalistic material This in a sense is not disadvantageous for the poet in an age when to get a hearing at all it is necessary that his work should be presented with some sort of a literary trade mark or preface in order to attract a public singularly heedless of anything that requires more than superficial attention But the situation is not favorable for a new book of verse which does not afford the reviewer these easy facilities Poetry of intrinsic beauty without any tag without a note of ultra modernity a defiant use of new form or the expression of sentiments supposedly revolutionary this is a difficult thing to definte or to exploit  The Sharing by Agnes Lee Mrs Freer is a book of this kind The poet s vision is concentric rather than excentric She does not give us a lens through which to view the external world but a crystal sphere in which to find a world of finer forms and essences Her work to borrow a painter s term has quality an attribute that must be felt rather than stated Her lyrics to borrow another phrase this time from an authoritative critic in The Dial are   Reviews  not easily reducible to any form of intellectual statement But was there ever any poetry unless it be Wordsworth s Ode to Duty that could be reduced to such a formula If one says of The Sharing that the setting free of three caged canaries reveals the moving history of a soul that has itself been caged and broken one yet misses all the keen delight in liberty in beautiful wide untrammeled spaces so sensitively suggested in the poem Clearly with a book of this sort the only possibility for the reviewer lies in suggestion also And the suggestion will not be missed by the reader who cares for something more than superficial cleverness Among the poems in the book that may be singled out for special mention are The Sharing The Silent House A Statue in a Garden Song of a Queen of Lombardy The  Drudge Numbers Her Going This last is a keenly psychological study of jealousy delicately incisive  Hard it was to live down the day and wonder  Wonder why the tears were forever welling  Wonder if on his lips her kiss I tasted  Turning to claim him   Sharp tongue have pity   Yes I knew But I loved him hoping for all  I said in my heart Time shall bring buds to blossom  Almost I saw the flower of the flame descending  Then she came toying  He is mine mine by the law of ages  Mine mine mine yes body and spirit  Glad I am she has gone her way to the shadow  Hate is upon me   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Oh the bar over which my soul would see  All that eludes my soul while he remembers  You dispel if you can my avenging passion  Clouds are before me  Mr Vachel Lindsay s work presents very little difficulty to the reviewer except that there are so many different angles from which it may be exploited There is his creed  of optimistic sincerity and there is his invention of a new choric form adapted to all the strident blaring noises of our blatant life today for he is no shirker but an accepter of all that conventional poets have been wont to decry Yet in the process by which poetry is turned into journalistic capital in the reviews so much of the finer quality of his work is lost that one is moved to go against the tide and record the subtler shades upon which a deeper enjoyment of  his poetry will rest  In this poet s work there is much that is fanciful but it is the higher quality of imagination that attracts us in his more serious poems imagination that is at once concrete and visionary Even when he seems to be slipping off into some indefinite incorporeal region of mid air it is the unexpected concrete touch that ties us to earth and awakens in us that vivid pleasure of experience which is always the poet s true touchstone Mr Lindsay has the mythopoeic faculty He has converted a fireman s ball or a group of Salvation Army psalm singers into a tribal image I know that I never see such a group now in North Clark Street that the image of General William Booth Entering   Reviews  Into Heaven does not take possession of my mind andnever see the fire engine rushing past that I do not spontaneously recall the symbol of passion that Mr Lindsay has made of it  Said the swift white horse To the swift black horse There goes the alarm There goes the alarm   Even the automobile horn has become as powerfully suggestive as the trumpet that shook the walls of Jericho That Mr Lindsay has been able to evoke this image out of certain apparent banalities of our life is no small thing It is not only a credit to his power but it argues much for the future of poetry in these states In this connection it is perhaps well to state that his growth has been peculiarly independent of foreign influence The suggested similarity between his work and that of the Futurists is merely an interesting parallel He has perhaps done what Signor Marinetti suggested should be done but his achievement was not due to Signor Marinetti s suggestion The record of his growth is apparent and his groping toward a form that would unite delicacy and strength and give full play to the choric appeal of mobile vocal sound has been followed step by step by his friends It is characteristic of his personality that his book should include poems of widely dissimilar vein and even of unequal merit His inclusion of the Dirge for a Righteous Kitten so incensed one serious minded critic that he refused to consider the volume at all but I know several small children to whom that poem is as meat and   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  drink and who with this as a starting point have quickly assimilated all the deep round vowel sounds and rolling bass of The Congo as well as the light graceful step of Judith the Dancer again not a bad thing for the future of poetry in these states  But it must not be thought that Mr Lindsay s muse is merely the muse of rag time It is true that he has molded and remolded his vehicle to fit the voice but the lasting power of his verse is as I have suggested in its power to evoke an image The effect of the image is increased through every means at his disposal by his selection of sounds of words and his hypnotic use of the refrain Many of the poems are too well known to need quotation The Fireman s Ball The Santa Fé Trail and several others have been published in POETRY The Congo his impressionist poem of the negro temperament is published for the first time This is of course too long to quote but the heading of one section Their Irrepressible High Spirits reminds me forcefully of a certain quality of Mr Lindsay s work that should not go unremarked its high spirits This in itself is characteristically American but this is probably the first time that we have found it turned to account in American verse not manifestly light or comic  I have often thought that translations of certain modern European dramas do not appeal to our audiences because of a difference in temperament rather than because of any definite hostility to a form of drama fine in itself and that when our young playwrights attempt the art they curiously   Reviews  enough shroud themselves in an imitative black coat of despair which is alike unnatural to them and to their audiences Whatever else our American temperament may be it is not bowed down by weight of woe and doesn t want to be In giving rein to his naturally high spirits and in frankly combining the sincere with the light or even frivolous it may be that Mr Lindsay is far more instinctively national than we suspect Those who look for the finesse of out worn European models in his work may not find it but they will find something that is abundantly alive and vital and destined to live by the inherent force of this vitality  A C H  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  Boston is discovering Imagism The Houghton Mifflin Company will
