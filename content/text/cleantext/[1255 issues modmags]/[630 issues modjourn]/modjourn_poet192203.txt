 MARCH 1922  MEDLEY OF POEMS  MOON RIDERS  I  WHA T have I saved out of a morning The earliest of the morning came with moon mist And the travel of a moon spilt purple Bars horse shoes Texas long horns Linked in night silver Linked under leaves in moonlit silver Linked in rags and patches Out of the ice houses of the morning moon Yes this was the earliest Before the cowpunchers on the eastern rims Began riding into the sun Riding the roan mustangs of morning   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Roping the mavericks after the latest stars  What have I saved out of a morning  Was there a child face I saw once Smiling up a stairway of the morning moon  II  It is time for work said a man in the morning He opened the faces of the clocks saw their works Saw the wheels oiled and fitted running smooth It is time to begin a day s work he said again Watching a bullfinch hop on the rain worn boards Of a beaten fence counting its bitter winters The clinging feet of the bullfinch and the flash Of its flying feathers as it flipped away Took his eyes away from the clocks his flying eyes He walked over stood in front of the clocks again And said I m sorry I apologize forty ways  III  The morning paper lay bundled Like a spear in a museum Across the broken sleeping room Of a moon sheet spider The spinning work of the morning spider s feet Left off where the morning paper s pages lay In the shine of the web in the summer dew grass The man opened the morning paper saw the firstpage   The back page the inside pages the editorials Saw the world go by eating stealing fighting Saw the headlines date lines funnies ads The marching movies of the workmen going to work the  workmen striking The workmen asking jobs five million pairs of eyes look for a boss and say Take me People eating with too much to eat people eating with  nothing in sight to eat tomorrow eating as though  eating belongs where people belong  Hustle you hustlers while the hustling s good Said the man turning the morning paper s pages Turning among headlines date lines funnies ads Hustlers carrying the banner said the man Dropping the paper and beginning to hunt the city Hunting the alleys boulevards back door by ways Hunting till he found a blind horse dying alone Telling the horse Tw o legs or four legs it s all the same  with a work plug  A hayfield mist of evening saw him Watching the moon riders lose the moon For new shooting stars He asked Christ what have I saved out of a morning He called up a stairway of the morning moon And he remembered a child face smiling up that same  stairway   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FEATHER LIGHTS  Macabre and golden the moon opened a slant of light  A triangle for an oriole to stand and sing Take me home  A layer of thin white gold feathers for a child queen of gypsies  So the moon opened a slant of light and let it go  So the lonesome dogs the fog moon the pearl mist came back  THE NAKED STRANGER  It is five months off Knit stitch and hemstitch Sheets bags towels these are the offerings When he is older or she is a big girl There may be flowers or ribbons or money For birthday offerings Now however We must remember it is a naked stranger Coming to us and the sheath of the arrival Is so soft we must be ready and soft too  Knit stitch hemstitch it is only five months  It would be easy to pick a lucky star for this baby If a choice of two stars lay before our eyes   One a pearl gold star and one pearl silver And the offer of a chance to pick a lucky star  When the high hour comes Let there be a light flurry of snow A little zigzag of white spots  Against the gray roofs The snow born all understand this as a luck wish  MEDLEY  Ignorance came in stones of gold The ignorant slept while the hangmen Hanged the keepers of the lights Of sweet stars such were the apothegms Offhand offerings of mule drivers  Eating sandwiches of rye bread  Salami and onions  To o Many Books we always called him A landscape of masterpieces and old favorites  Fished with their titles for his eyes  In the upstairs and downstairs rooms Of his house Whenever he passed  The old time bar room where Pete Morehouse  Shot the chief of police where The sponge squads shot two bootleggers   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  He always remembered the verse story  The Face on the Bar room Floor  The tramp on a winter night Saddened and warmed with whiskey Telling of a woman he wanted And a woman who wanted him How whiskey wrecked it all Taking a piece of chalk Picturing her face on the bar room floor Fixing the lines of her face While he told the story Then gasping and falling with finished heartbeats Dead  And whenever he passed over the bridge at night And took the look up the river to smaller bridges Barge lights and looming shores He always thought of Edgar Allan Poe With a load of hootch in him Going to a party of respectable people Who called for a speech Who listened to Poe recite the Lord s Prayer Correctly word for word yet with lush unmistakable Intonations so haunting the dinner party people All excused themselves to each other  Whenever Too Many Books Passed over the town bridge in the gloaming   Carl Sandburg  He thought of Poe breaking up that party Of respectable people Such was Too Many Books We called him that  GYPSY MOTHER  In a hole in a wall on Halsted Street sits a gypsy woman In a garish gas lit rendezvous in a humpback higgling hole in a wall  The left hand is a tattler stars and oaths and alphabets Commit themselves and tell happenings gone happenings to come pathways of honest people hypocrites  Long pointed fingers mean imagination a star on the third finger says a black shadow walks near  Cross the gypsy s hand with fifty cents and she takes your left hand and reads how you shall be happy in love or not and whether you die rich or not  Signs outside the hole in a wall say so misspell the promises scrawl the superior gypsy mysteries  A red shawl on her shoulders falls with a fringe hem to a green skirt Chains of yellow beads sweep from her neck to her tawny hands Fifty springtimes must have kissed her mouth holding a calabash pipe   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  She pulls slow contemplative puffs of smoke She is a shape for ghosts of contemplation to sit around and ask why something cheap as happiness is here and more besides than plain happiness chapped lips rough eyes red shawl gypsy perfection of offhand insolence  She is thinking about somebody and something the same as Whistler s mother sat and thought about somebody and something  In a hole in a wall on Halsted Street are stars oaths alphabets Carl Sandburg   SONG SKETCHES  WE HAVE A DAY  We have a day we have a night Which have been made for our delight  Shall we run and run and run Up the path of the rising sun  Shall we roll down every hill Or lie still Listening while the whispering leaves Promise what no one believes  The hours poise breathless for flight and brig  Only a night only a day We must not let them get away  Don a foolish cap and bell For all is well and all is well  Dance through woods a purple blue  Dance into Lanes that are a hidden stem Beneath the beauty over them  The hours lift their shadow form are warm   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Why do you still stand mute and white  The day is past but there is night  Turn your head give me your lips  The darkness slips The darkness slips  We could make it hushed and still If you will We could hear close to the ground Life the one authentic sound  The hours as a startled faun are gone  SPRING MORNING  O day if I could cup my hands and drink of you  And make this shining wonder be  A part of me  O day O day  You lift and sway your colors on the sky  Till I am crushed with beauty Why is there  More of reeling sunlit air  Than I can breathe Why is there sound  In silence Why is a singing wound  About each hour  And perfume when there is no flower  O day O day How may I press  Nearer to loveliness   Marion Strobel  TONIGHT  A flame Leaps high In a wind  I am the same  I go M y head High I flame  Red blue Oh  Tonight The sky Will be a  Cry of light  Fire Come swift As wind come  Lift me higher  THE SILENCE STIRS AGAIN  The silence that has lain so long between us Stirs again The rushes bend in shining pathways To the shining end The air is burdened with the rose that is not there Always the rose   I have no laughter now no tears  Only the silence grows big with years Only the silence has a touch That hurts overmuch  The rushes bend In shining pathways to the shining end Bend and close  THE NIGHT  The night binds darkness round my eyes  And makes me wise  The quiet hours beguile  Like maidens chaste in single file  Like maidens who have said  Be comforted  The truth of day falls far away  And far away  And all the little gaieties  Are dressed in colors as I please  And sadness has a gentle hand  I understand  The night bound darkness round my eyes I was made wise   Marion Strobel  I WOULD PRETEND  Now that between us there is nothing more To say I would have loud and foolish speech With you I would pretend I still adore Your voice Come beautiful draw near and teach The way my hands should go in a caress Should fingers trail as pink feet of a crane That skim the water or should fingers press Their weight heavily Draw near me again What does it matter if the words you say Are lies if they be sweet to listen to Your lips are quite as cruel quite as gay As ever and your eyes are honest blue Oh be sublimely false who are not true And I ll pretend I love you as I do  ADMONITION  Come quietly without a word I am so tired of the things I ve heard I am so tired of words that tear At beauty till the branch is bare  Of words that will not let beauty be A sweet clustered mystery As a Canterbury bell Purse your lips but do not tell   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  FRIGHTENED FACE  Child of the frightened face Trying to understand The little bit of love Under your hand  Holding the little love Under fingers that crush That which is soft as the Throat of a thrush  Holding your hand upon The wonder of the thing Crushing out the song that Wanted to sing  Child of the frightened face Why do your fingers try To kill the little love Soon it would die  DAILY PRAYER  And at last when I go Will it be so Shall I find you behind The rude platitude of death   Marion Strobel  I kneel within the certainty That you are near to me Each day I pray That I may follow through To you Each day I pray  L ENVOI  The moments reach and touch the hours gently Each is kind Each is soothing as the tips Of fingers held to lips  The moments reach and touch the hours flowers Will bloom again And I shall pick fresh jonquils for the room And I shall pick fresh jonquils in the usual way Every day  The moments reach and touch the hours Time has no beginning and no end Dear friend  Marion Strobel   WORKING HOUR SONGS  THE SHOE FACTORY  Song of the knot  They told me When I came That this would be drudgery  Always the same Thing over and over Day after day  The same swift movement In the same small way  Pick up Place Push And it s tied Take off Cut And put It aside  Over and over  In rhythmical beat Some say it is drudgery But to me it is sweet   Ruth Harwood  Pick up Place Push And it s tied Out doors The sky Is so blue And so wide  It s a joyous song Going steadily on Marching in measures Till the day is gone  Pick up Place Push And it s tied Soon end Of day Will bring him To my side  Oh I love the measures Singing so fast Speeding happy hours Till he comes at last   MAKING LITTLE CLOTHES  Grey rain on the window pane And in my heart grey rain And the ceaseless whir of machines Pounding my weary brain  He had such a little share of life And now he s gone And all my heart went with him Yet I go numbly on Making little clothes Just the size of him Little clothes for others But nevermore for him  Grey rain on the window pane And in my heart grey rain And the endless grind of machines Beating a dull refrain  ALWAYS AND ALWAYS  Always and always I go out from myself In the silver morning Out to greet some new friend With my arms laden with friendship gifts And a hundred little songs of gladness on my lips   Ruth Harwood  Always and always I return to myself In the purple twilight Back to the comforting sureness of myself To fill my empty arms again with gifts To ease the little hurt my heart has brought  Ruth Harwood  THE UNLOVED  Stephen son of me You will never be born my dear Light of day you will never see And the earth sounds never hear  But after I have died When I come to the courts of the sun Though husband love I have never had And lovers never a one  You will stand with a ripple of joy On the lips that have never smiled And I shall clasp my son at last My child my child  Alison Buchanan   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ECCLESIASTES  In the smoke blue cabaret She sang some comic thing I heeded not at all Till Sing she cried Sing So I sang in tune with her The only song I know The doors shall be shut in the streets And the daughters of music brought low  Her eyes and working lips Gleamed through the cruddled air I tried to sing with her Her song of devil may care But in the shouted chorus My lips would not be stilled The rivers run into the sea Yet the sea is not filled  Then one came to my table Who said with a laughing glance I f that is the way you sing Why don t you learn to dance But I said With this one song My heart and lips are cumbered The crooked cannot be made straight Nor that which is wanting numbered   Morris Bishop  This song must I sing Whatever else I covet Hear the end of my song Hear the beginning of it More bitter than death the woman Beside me still she stands Whose heart is snares and nets And whose hands are bands  A NEW HAMPSHIRE BOY  Under Monadnock Fold on fold The world s fat kingdoms Lie unrolled  Far in the blue south City smoke swirled Marks the dwellings Of the kings of the world  Old kings and broken Soon to die Once you had little As little as I  Smoke of the city Blow in my eyes   Blind me a little Make me wise  Dust of the city Blow and gust Make me like all men Color of dust  I stand on Monadnock And seem to see Brown and purple kingdoms Offered to me  Morris Bishop  ROADS  You who have made the ancient road of turf  That my feet might pass over it  Into the level evening  Make now the ancient road of tears  That my song may pass over it  Make the ancient road of song  That my ghost may pass over it  Coming with the new earth  Sarah Unna   HOLIDAY CROWD  They do not know they wear their wounds so plain These covered bodies swathed in cloth and fur They do not dream they hold their naked pain Before this show of life the checkered stir Here in the wintry sunlight on the street And yet like martyrs on an old church wall They point their wounds their bleeding hands and feet The aching scars and lips that drank the gall For life has hurt them though they will not cry Enough shaped flesh to hunger quick or dead Withered them harried twisted bones awry And bleached them white beneath their flying red Strange skeletons in merry dominoes They do not dream how plain the outline shows  WINGED VICTORY  Your flimsy dress Out of a bargain basement Reacts to the wind As the living draperies Of the Victory of Samothrace Your body also is proudly revealed Cleaving the air as hers And verily you would do as well Without a head  Hortense Flexner   MONOLOGUE FROM A MATTRESS  Heinrich Heine aetat 56 loquitur  Can that be you La Mouche Wait till I lift  This palsied eyelid and make sure Ah true  Come in dear fly and pardon my delay  In thus existing I can promise you  Next time you come you ll find no dying poet  Without sufficient spleen to see me through  The joke becomes too tedious a jest  I am afraid my mind is dull today  I have that something heavier on my chest And then you see I ve been exchanging thoughts With Doctor Franz He talked of Kant and Hegel As though he d nursed them both through whooping cough And as he left he let his finger shake Too playfully as though to say Now off With that long face you ve years and years to live I think he thinks so But for Heaven s sake Don t credit it and never tell Mathilde Poor dear she has enough to bear already This was a month During my lonely weeks One person actually climbed the stairs To seek a cripple It was Berlioz But Berlioz always was original  Come here my lotus flower It is best I drop the mask today the half cracked shield   Louis Untermeyer  Of mockery calls for younger hands to wield Laugh or I ll hug it closer to my breast So I can be as mawkish as I choose And give my thoughts an airing let them loose For one last rambling stroll before Now look Why tears you never heard me say the end Before before I clap them in a book And so get rid of them once and for all This is their holiday we ll let them run Some have escaped already There goes one What I have often mused did Goethe mean So many years ago at Weimar Goethe said Heine has all the poet s gifts but love Good God but that is all I ever had More than enough so much of love to give That no one gave me any in return And so I flashed and snapped in my own fires Until I stood with nothing left to burn A twisted trunk in chilly isolation Ein Fichtenbaum steht einsam you recall I was that northern tree and in the South Amalia So I turned to scornful cries Hot iron songs to save the rest of me Plunging the brand in my own misery Crouching behind my pointed wall of words Ramparts I built of moons and loreleys Enchanted roses sphinxes love sick birds Giants dead lads who left their graves to dance   Fairies and phoenixes and friendly gods A curious frieze half renaissance half Greek Behind which in revulsion from romance I lay and laughed and wept till I was weak Words were my shelter words my one escape Words were my weapons against everything Was I not once the son of Revolution Give me the lyre I said and let me sing M y song of battle words like flaming stars Shot down with power to burn the palaces Words like bright javelins to fly with fierce Hate of the oily philistines and glide Through all the seven heavens till they pierce The pious hypocrites who dare to creep Into the Holy Places Then I cried I am a fire to rend and roar and leap I am all joy and song all sword and flame H m you observe me passionate I aim To curb these wild emotions lest they soar Or drive against my will So I have said These many years and still they are not tame Scraps of a song keep rumbling in my head Listen you never heard me sing before  When a false world betrays your trust  And stamps upon your fire  When what seemed blood is only rust  Take up the lyre   Louis Untermeyer  How quickly the heroic mood Responds to its own ringing The scornful heart the angry blood Leap upward singing  Ah that was how it used to be But now Du sch ner Todesengel it is odd How more than calm I am Franz said he knew It was religion and it is perhaps Religion or morphine or poultices God knows I sometimes have a sentimental lapse And long for saviors and a physical God When health is all used up when money goes When courage cracks and leaves a shattered will Christianity begins For a sick Jew It is a very good religion Still I fear that I shall die as I have lived A long nosed heathen playing with his scars A pagan killed by Weltschmerz I remember Once when I stood with Hegel at a window I being full of bubbling youth and coffee Spoke in symbolic tropes about the stars Something I said about those high Abodes of the blest provoked his temper Abodes the stars he froze me with a sneer A light eruption on the firmament But cried romantic I is there no sphere Where virtue is rewarded when we die   And Hegel mocked A very pleasant whim So you demand a bonus since you spent One lifetime and refrained from poisoning Your testy grandmother How much of him Remains in me even when I am caught In dreams of death and immortality  To be eternal what a brilliant thought It must have been conceived and coddled first By some old shopkeeper in Nuremberg His slippers warm his children amply nursed Who with his lighted meerschaum in his hand His nightcap on his head one summer night Sat drowsing at his door and mused How grand If all of this could last beyond a doubt This placid moon this plump gemuthlichkeit Pipe breath and summer never going out To vegetate through all eternity But no such everlastingness for me God if he can keep me from such a blight  Death it is but the long cool night And life s a sad and sultry day It darkens I grow sleepy  1 am weary of the light  Over my bed a strange tree gleams And there a nightingale is loud   Louis Untermeyer She sings of love love only I hear it even in dreams  My Mouche the other day as I lay here  Slightly propped up upon this mattress grave  In which I ve been interred these few eight years  I saw a dog a little pampered slave  Running about and barking I would have given Heaven could I have been that dog to thrive Like him so senseless and so much alive And once I called myself a blithe Hellene  Who am too much in love with life to live The shrug is pure Hebraic for what I ve been A lenient Lord will tax me and forgive  Dieu me pardonnera c est son métier  But this is jesting There are other scandals You haven t heard Can it be dusk so soon Or is this deeper darkness Is that you Mother how did you come And are those candles There on that tree whose golden arms are filled Or are

Echod  Mouche Mathilde  Louis Untermeyer  COMMENT  NEWSPAPER VERSE  A RECENT editorial in the Washington Herald  begins with the following paragraph  Literary editors of newspapers know that some of the best verse brought out in America first sees the light of day in the columns of the press Morocco binding and hand drawn initials don t insure excellence nor have the higher class magazines any monopoly on truly good poetry  And corroborative evidence is offered from the Atlanta Constitution which says  Some of the best poetry written in this country today appears first in the columns of the daily or weekly press The literary magazines have never had a monopoly of it and they never will  In discussing newspaper verse it is hardly fair to include the weekly press for our only purely literary reviews or reviews largely devoted to current literature such papers as The Literary Review of the New York Evening Post The Nation The New Republic The Freeman the New York Times Magazine are weeklies and as a rule they are much more progressively edited so far as modern poetry is concerned than most of the monthlies Reedy s Mirror for example under the editorship of a remarkable man was a much more literary magazine in its day than The Century Harper s Scribner s or any other alleged higher class magazine and it had more discoveries to its credit in both verse and prose   than all these New York respectables combined In fact the weeklies have been more hospitable to modern poets to the new movement than any of the monthlies except The Dial The Masses with its successor The Liberator and the magazines which like POETRY are the special organs of the art  Therefore we shall confine our part of the present discussion to newspaper verse to those colyumists and other poets and poetasters who have got their start and won their fame through broad cast publication in the daily papers On this basis let us inquire whether some of the best verse is thus introduced  The best light verse yes unquestionably The wittily rhyming commentator on life and letters appearing from day to day in Sharps and Flats A Line o Type or Two The Conning Tower The Periscope and other columns less familiar to this editor has added to our literature masterpieces in this kind Eugene Field began it with poems like The Bibliomaniac s Prayer and The Truth about Horace each of which started a fashion Bert Leston Taylor continued it with such incisive satires as In the Gallery and The Kaiser s Farewell to Prince Henry And more recent Chicago philosophers are living up to the tradition Who could show a nimbler wit or a keener critical insight than Keith Preston in many poems now reprinted from The Periscope in his new book Splinters for example this one entitled Effervescence and Evanescence   We ve found this Scott Fitzgerald chap A chipper charming child He s taught us how the flappers flap And why the whipper snappers snap What makes the women wild But now he should make haste to trap The ducats in his dipper The birds that put him on the map Will shortly all begin to rap And flop to something flipper  And if Mr Preston wields a rapier listen to the blows of Guy Lee s bludgeon in honor of that noble animal the frog who has to keep his mouth shut in order to breathe We quote from a Chicago Tribune of recent date  When I hear the politician spouting hot air by the ton When I note the silly twaddle of the genus Native Son When I m sentenced to a banquet where a war of words ensues When a socialist gets near me and begins to shout his views When a bore essays a story that has neither point nor end When a highbrow author s ego by his voice starts to extend When a woman with a grievance or without one launches out On a marathon of language o er the conversation route I ponder on this habit of mankind to squeak and squawk In a never ending serial of talk and talk and talk And I figger as we flounder in the vocalistic bog It s a pity human beings are not fashioned like the frog  Such humor as these things from our newspaper poets is straight American stuff expressive of our kind of smiling common sense our special good natured chuckle over the piffle and burble the mawkishness and pretense which encumber our every day life Such wit from the colyum   Newspaper Verse  ists is a shaft of sunlight on the breakfast table it clears the air and gleams on the sharpened edge of the mind  But what about the more serious verse of the newspaper poets To be sure Eugene Field s finest poems such as Little Boy Blue and Wynken Blynken and Nod first saw the light in his Sharps and Flats Frank Stanton achieved one now and then in Atlanta and a few slyly delicate poems by Bert Taylor adorned the Line But the successors of these men have been less inclined to favor the unsmiling muse or she to favor them and the songsters they admit to their columns are usually about as adventurously lyric as a chirping sparrow If some of the best verse first sees the light of day in these columns of cheer the present writer has missed it Yet here may be found as a rule the best of the newspaper verse at least these column sparrows are honest and their saltily humorous environment keeps them from rot and reek  But what shall be said of certain other kinds of seriously intended newspaper verse of the placid rhyming journalese of Walt Mason or the syndicated moralizings of Edgar Guest The former may be harmless his endless reeling of facile observations has sometimes a faint trace of savor the tireless crank is turned by a mild old busybody at least humanely observant But the stickily sugary Mr Guest is not only a blight but a menace His molasses factory proves profitable in more ways than one so like other wide awake business men he spreads its products over the land Syndicated in hundreds of   newspapers crowded with platform engagements this  favorite of fortune journeying to Denver is met at the  station by the whole Colorado legislature adjourned in  his honor and celebrating his greatness with a brass band  And the school children of many cities are stimulated by  his example toward the high rewards financial and glory  coronal of poesy Let us examine Mr Guest s style here is a recent and typical example entitled For the New Year This I would like to be braver and bolder Just a bit wiser because I am older Just a bit kinder to those I may meet Just a bit manlier taking defeat  This for the New Year my wish and my plea  Lord make a regular man out of me  This I would like to be just a bit finer  More of a smiler and less of a whiner  Just a bit quicker to stretch out my hand  Helping another who s struggling to stand  This is my prayer for the New Year to be  Lord make a regular man out of me  This I would like to be just a bit fairer  Just a bit better and just a bit squarer  Not quite so ready to censure and blame  Quicker to help every man in the game  Not quite so eager men s failings to see  Lord make a regular man out of me  This I would like to be just a bit truer  Less of the wisher and more of the doer  Broader and bigger more willing to give  Living and helping my neighbor to live  This for the New Year my prayer and my pica  Lord make a regular man out of me   News paper Verse  What do those Colorado legislators think they find in such sermonizing twaddle as this Poetry if such a fond allusion is possible how do they define poetry In what department of their minds do they receive its proud appeal Wisdom if they are honoring a sage what high truth is he telling them To what clear heights is he leading their souls Do they discover beauty in this cheap rattle of foot rule rhymes emotion in this sickish slobber of easy virtue Is it this rhymester or themselves they are stultifying when they offer him public homage and thereby inform the rising generation that he is their ideal of a great man of letters  Mr Guest is not the only one of his kind alas but he is conspicuous and typical These syndicated rhymers like the movie producers are learning that it pays to be good that one gets by by giving the people the emotions of virtue simplicity and goodness with this program paying at the box office And it pays very well  B L T hit off the situation a decade or more ago saying Lives of poets oft remind us Not to wait too long for time But departing leave behind us Obvious facts embalmed in rhyme Poems that we have to ponder Turn us prematurely gray We are infinitely fonder Of the simple heartfelt lay  Whitman s Leaves of Grass is odious Browning s Ring and Book a bore   Bleat ye bards in lines melodious Bleat that two and two is four  Today he might have added  Bleat ye bards of home and mother Pray to be a regular man Treacle mixed with tears is golden Pile the shekels while you can  Let the newspaper poets be true to the muse of laughter We need their salt in our daily food lest the maudlin adulterations of pseudo literary profiteers poison our in ards H M  REVIEWS  MISS LOWELL S LEGENDS  Legends by Amy Lowell Houghton Mifflin Co  Too many legends are getting lost and forgotten To tell any of them over again and save them from the dust and ashes of the dead is a good thing but even better to tell them so people will listen To most of Miss Amy Lowell s Legends it is not easy to listen intently they are too crowded with adjectives with ornament with imagery they are obese with adornment So they do not cut into you the way even the bare outline of a story may do in some textbook of mythology or the way voices of a legendary day sometimes still reach you through old men and old women bridging two epochs   In Legends Miss Lowell has sought alliance with Aztec Cantonese Indian and English but has not it seems become one with any of them Their grief is not her grief their passion not her passion At their feasts and funerals she revels more like a tourist in the surprises of intricate ancient rites She lays no claim it is true to accuracy she has changed added subtracted jumbled several stories together she says at will to suit her particular vision But she has not made them over with a vision acute enough to equal the origin of primitive lore She has not made them with an economy of means that comes of violence  As a vendor of foreign goods she resorts to selling talk with sometimes the taint of a conflicting code of morals or manners upon it So in the Aztec story of a fox assaulting the moon the print of a fox s paws on the disc of the moon is labeled as obscene She labels these characters the fox and the moon instead of making them sheerly exist  It is a pity the way this book has of calling things by so many names that they cease to be named at all One is aware of passing by almost with indifference succinct polished song and picture which in more spare surroundings might make an instant appeal a quick thrust This passage for one A stream flowed in a sunwise turn across the prairie and the name of  the stream was Burnt Water because it tasted dark like smoke  The prairie ran out tongues of raw colors blue of camass red of  geranium yellow of parsley at the young green grass The prairie   flung up its larks on a string of sunshine it lay like a catching sheet beneath the black breasts balancing down on a wind calling See it See it in little round voices  If you consider each legend in the book as a unit of art it is easy to remember only the two last poems Before the Storm and Four Sides to a House One of these is New England legend the other not labeled seems as real and as native to Miss Lowell The ghosts of a man and child driving a high yellow chaise and a white horse before wind and rain unwind as the wheels whirl a keen impetuous movie of New England Four Sides to a House is a beautiful ballad the crying of an old man murdered buried in a well Words rhymes stanzas fall into place the sound is true the design complete and haunting Here is one bead of the ballad string quoted for the pleasure of quoting  Around the house and around the house  With a wind that is North and a wind that is South  Peter Peter  Mud and ooze and a dead man s wrist  Wrenching the shutters apart like mist  The mud and the ooze and the dead man twist  They are praying Peter This is a poem with intangible quality Many of the others disobey the laws of measure

is difficult to write an appreciation or criticism of modern literature because words have altered slowly during the past century and have lost their rightful meaning Beauty wisdom life these terms have come to represent an indefinite standard of pedantry or the washed out sentiment of some school room text Civilization has rendered the states that these words should express almost impossible of achievement So there is discontent a brooding rebellion no new forceful words and the old ones blurred until the same sentence may evoke for different people entirely separate worlds  Thus it has been said of H D s earlier poetry that it was perfectly wrought but cold and passionless and that it was concerned rather with the loveliness of a perished age than with the modern world or everyday emotions But is it not simply the association of Greek with scholasticism in the minds of these critics that has led them astray in their consideration of the poet s work  Perfectly wrought the poems are the rhythms swoop in and out of the head as birds perch and flutter in and out of apple branches Lines haunt the ears as the sound of rain in the South The use of some simple but unexpected syllable brings all the fragrance into a mood that the Ionian roses suddenly awaken after some swift storm But they are not cold they are not passionless and apart from the color of some Attic names how   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  are these songs anything but the expression of the emotions and desires of an extremely present age  To people born in England H D s work is peculiarly American American with a southern flavor and a singularly native strength Call Simaetha any American name and nothing is lost but the impersonality of the far off silver grey Greek syllables Circe is any woman of intellect who with the very sincerity of her vision turns lesser minds each to his own self The children in Hymen are strange in their beauty only because the restrictions of school have not seized them too early nor crushed them into patterns  It is true that H D is concerned with life which changes little from epoch to epoch rather than with the exterior impressions of telephones or steel rails She is very sensitive to the visible world but it is not particularly Greek her country is any stretch of sea coast in Europe or America where there are sand and low pools and surge of heavy rocks Compare the Phaedra and the Hippolytus series which were actually written in Greece with Cuckoo Song Thetis or Evadne Apart from an added intensity of color the lizard blue water the red sands of Crete they are as independent as the poems written further north of any definite landscape  Could anything be more modern of mood than these few lines from At Baia  I should have thought In a dream you would have brought   Spear shaft and Cyclamen flower  Some lovely perilous thing Orchids piled in a great sheath As who would say in a dream I send you this Who left the blue veins Of your throat unkissed  The song is too long to quote in full but it expresses perhaps more perfectly than any other recent poem the disappointment and yet the sympathy which come when some personality one has admired fails to fulfil both its promise and its task  It is not easy to be true to any faith in a war torn world Perhaps the most difficult test of all is to keep faith in beauty But there is no sentiment or weakness in the lines which follow they are stark as a war chant or as waves against a prow  But beauty is set apart Beauty is cast by the sea A barren rock Beauty is set about With wrecks of ships Upon our coasts death keeps The shallows death waits Clutching toward us From the deeps  Beauty is set apart The winds that slash its beach Swirl the coarse sand Upward toward the rocks  Beauty is set apart From the islands And from Greece   Life is a fact to the poet not a dream But she has a trick of hiding a difficult thought under a beautiful phrase until the eyes read the song carelessly and only with the ripening of personal experience is the truth uncovered behind the vivid words A psychological state that a scientist might take a volume to describe is crystallized into a couple of pages And she can turn and write songs such as the one which follows simple as any Elizabethan lyric and without the sixteenth century mannerisms  From citron bower be her bed Cut from branch of tree a flower Fashioned for her maidenhead  From Lydian apples sweet of husk Cut the width of board and lathe Carve the feet from myrtle wood  Let the palings of her bed Be quince and box wood overlaid With the scented bark of yew  That all the wood in blossoming May calm her heart and cool her blood For losing of her maidenhood  Her psychology is never once at fault Thetis proud beautiful and alone Simaetha wrecked by war Phaedra smashed by alien forces it is only their names perhaps their personal beauty that differentiate them from the individuals who struggle and suffer in this present world They are not easily found but personality is rare in an age of standardized opinions and patented emotions   And perhaps the essential characteristic of these poems is their originality they are cyclamen flowers caught on the spear point of an analytical intellect  Not cold not passionless but with emotion and thought perfectly balanced Hymen can make even the disenchanted days of which the poet writes bright with beauty W Bryher  A DISTINGUISHED YOUNG MAN  The Living Frieze by Mark Turbyfill Monroe Wheeler  Evanston I11  Mark Turbyfill is a young man but has already been spoken of in print and out and it is a pleasure to consider his poems as a whole in Mr Wheeler s excellently made book One has already heard so much unfortunate talk of Mr Turbyfill s estheticism that one is lucky to have a slight acquaintance with his work as it has appeared in the magazines before approaching this book by way of the reviewers When a reviewer in our generation speaks of a poet as an esthete he is generally being sentimental about that poet s sentimentality and this is a lamentable condition for a good word to reach As for reviewers they are largely static  For Mr Turbyfill can indeed be sentimental and that a good part of the time his sentimentality being greatly patterned after the writings of that other esthete of late consideration Richard Aldington But it is not   for this reason that he is one of the dozen or so living Americans who have done anything worth remembering At his best Mr Turbyfill is the master of a certain fleeting precision that like the finest of needles strikes deep into one s being and is gone before it can be observed  I am the surprised young man light walker on night lawns  he writes and in a recognition and fuller exploitation of this fact will lie his greatness if he ever achieves it This one sentence unfortunately is embedded in a long discussion of a love affair which has few merits and very often Mr Turbyfill spoils an excellent passage by not knowing where to cut Had this passage stood alone it had been one of his finest poems  Perhaps his weakness is a conscience which drives him to do complete justice to his friends loves and admirations wherever they have acted as the original impetus of a poem He forgets that a poem is a state of perfection at which a poet arrives by whatever means and that the poem has no responsibility of any sort to ladies or lambrequins It is a thing that begins somewhere and ends in itself  In such poems as Shapes and Fertile Gesture Mr Turbyfill has remembered or not needed to remember this fundamental truth I quote Shapes intact as an example of the poet at his finest  Let us deliberately sit into design With these elephant ears   A Distinguished Young Man  Stretched from the pot Into green wax consciousness  Let us exert Our unused selves Into other static Sharpnesses  In what fleet gestures Have you found eternity  His amber painted torso A Persian dancer Has conceived into a leaf line The head inclined  Other poems that one remembers are She Walks to Pisa Fragment of Vision Carved Mood Burden of Blue and Gold The Moments Halt a Little While before the Day and End of Summer There are lines and passages scattered through other poems the finest of these being the sentence already quoted and the third stanza of  The Intangible Symphony  To estimate the magnitude of such a poet as Mr Turbyfill is a difficult if not impossible task This despite the fact that at least one word of magnitude has been spoken of him in this review But one can accurately say that his five or six finest poems are perfectly executed and entirely achieve that which they apparently set out to achieve And perhaps this is the fullest praise that one can give to any poet Yvor Winters   A PRIZE WINNER  Heavens and Earth by Stephen Vincent Benêt Henry Holt amp Co This book shared with Carl Sandburg s Smoke and  Steel the Poetry Society s recent award of five hundred dollars to the best American verse published in 1920  Not long ago I heard Robert Frost remark laughingly before an audience that one could practically place a poet as major or minor according to the number of times he used the word beauty By that gauge Heavens and Earth is indeed a large order  The first section of the book is called Two Visions of Helen it begins Slowly blanch handed Dawn eyes half awake Upraised magnificent the silver urn  The word morning appears in italics in the margin to print on the mind a clear and single image One need not demand of Stephen Benêt that he be either Carl Sandburg or J V A Weaver many of the younger poets are turning away with tired eyes from the verities of modern life But Victoria is dead that at least has been definitely settled it is too late to contest it and futile to look back  The poet continues Beautiful monstrous dreams they seemed as they ran Trees come alive at the nod of a god grown mute Their eyes looked up to the sun like a valiant man Their bows clashed shrill on the loins and limbs of the brute   A Prize winner  The second line is quite plainly inserted to meet the exigencies of rhyme the rest plainly a compromise with rhyme An ultimate word exists that will do duty for both sense and sound Is not art the pursuit of that word  Laughing rejoicing white as a naked birch  Slim as a spear in a torrent of moving towers  Itys the prince ran gay in the storm of their search  Silverly shod on feet that outstripped the Hours  Heavens and Earth so aptly illustrates the vices of its school that the exposé may as well be thorough now it is begun Was the towers line added only to rhyme with Hours since white as a naked birch conveys not only color but form For me slim as a spear is besides being poor economy confusing it leaves me with the blurred image of one who has stared for a long time at the same spot Nature is admittedly prolix it is left for that royal combination of gift and reason which determine the poet to model and trim beyond the possibility of confusion Let the artist s scope be the universe but let the artist hold the rein It is admonitory to speculate on what the masters must have held in reserve in prunings alone for they were all great economists And who does not know that one thought leads to another  Stephen Benêt has imagination otherwise one fails to detect behind his art that significant struggle for the final syllable the final image Rather a quick acceptance of what the tempter tradition whispers into the ear  We go on with The First Vision of Helen and meet with   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  an interesting line He dreamed as a dog dreams uneasily and another And how she smoothed her hair back with one hand the universal gesture of woman But The Visions of Helen are not successful What is the reason if any for the long symphonic arrangement One has a right to expect that the form a poet uses justify itself Many of Mr Benét s changes of movement differ only in length of line otherwise the same overwrought design the same lameness Although both the Helen stories have a reasonable amount of inherent interest one is left with the feeling that they might have been done carefully in a page apiece with more point  Two at the Crossroads dallies with the delicious idea of the meeting of one Palomides and a stranger Palomides riding furiously his brain a black pin wheel He answers the stranger s inquiry after the sea road with a maudlin account of his love for Iseult and rides madly on Then the amusing denouement  Palomides was far And settling well his harp upon his back With something of amusement in his mouth Tristram rode southward to the Breton ships  But Mr Benét is still without identity In this instance it is a slightly chastened Tennyson Many moderns write for the eye alone H D William Carlos Williams subordinate the oral to the visual making a form akin in impression to the mural or bas relief The concern of the present poet is to grind out grand   A Prize winner  iloquent Victorian harmonies Fortunately it has been proved by Carl Sandburg among others that one may write primarily for the ear and still retain the identity both of the individual and of the age  Take Three Days Ride the old theme of elopement and tragic outcome a story which depends for very existence upon the unique style of the artist and its relevancy to period and locality Certainly no man who takes pride in his modernity would have begun thus  We had fled full fast from her father s keep And the time had come that we must sleep  For the rest it is to be remembered that as we live in the age of the superlative hyperbole no longer has force behind it To exaggerate in the hope of heightening the effect of drama is to frustrate oneself in advance Simple statement of fact is more impressive  The Kingdom of the Mad the last section a series of sonnets in a less serious humor is more felicitous The poet seems not quite so young and chaotic He detaches himself and begins to speak in order with urbanity  Books should be tried by a judge and a jury as though they were crimes and counsel should be heard on both sides says Samuel Butler in his Note Books On my side I am left with the unsatisfactory sense that Stephen Benet s verses are melodramatic accidents of rhythm and rhyme I look in vain for volition for image and thought too sacred to have been lightly changed  Pearl Andelson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  A LUTE OF ONE STRING  The Lifted Cup by Jessie B Rittenhouse Houghton Mifflin Co This small book of forty or more very brief poems is a  soft voiced little lute of one string So restricted a lyric range seems scarcely possible from a woman who has traveled about this varied world and the emotional experience it records is too narrow to be easily accepted as the whole truth It is rather an unconscious yielding to a convention the presentation of a wistful and sensitive feminine type as men and women of richer experience expect to find it We have it caught to perfection in a number of these poems for example The Door  There was a door stood long ajar That one had left for me While I went trying other doors To which I had no key And when at last I turned to seek The refuge and the light A gust of wind had shut the door And left me in the night Perhaps the following poem comes nearer escaping the convention than any other in this book has a brighter bloom Its first line is its title We who give our hearts in spring Putting all the old life by We shall start with everything Keen and glad beneath the sky We shall know the urge of grass Parting each detaining clod   A Lute of One String  Know the one sweet day they pass Flowers the spirit of the sod  We are caught into the flame Where the golden fire runs All its ardor is the same In the flesh and in the suns  H M  A POET IN EMBRYO  Archways of Life by Mercedes de Acosta Moffat Yard  amp Co  This book shows a distinct advance over Moods in  poetic technique although most of the poems still leave much to be desired The author has certain gifts of the poet quick feeling a degree of imaginative insight and eagerness to pour out her soul to express the beauty and strangeness of life to give herself away She says what she has to say with a forthright simplicity and directness and in such poems as Platitudes and Your Face she says a fine thing with refreshment in it  But she is just beginning to learn her trade She shows a promising capacity to learn it in three or four poems Unreality Poor Fools To Vouletti in which there is a suggestion of poetic rhythm Sometimes she uses rhyme usually the irregular half veiled rhymes now so much in vogue but not yet with quite the air of an adept Occasionally she should give another thought to such details as grammar one can stand will for shall all of us do that but not the maddest of we three   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  However one may forgive much to a book which reveals a fresh and ardent personality And one may hope that after a few more experimental sheaves the art will respond to the impulse H M  RHETORIC UNASHAMED  Ireland Unfreed Poems of 1921 by Sir William Watson John Lane Co Rhetoric here marches unashamed across the cluttered  stage of the world s affairs rhetoric flaunting exaggerated gestures under its shabby outworn toga stubbing the toe of its stiff buskin against  rapine masked as order his vast maw With Vengeance still uncloyed  Is it possible that this kind of thing is still masking as poetry here begins a sonnet To the Prime Minister yet again  Like your renown clad namesake who did slay Far across Time and its vast charnels drear If only with a legendary spear A fabled dragon you in your midday Did unto ravening things give battle and they Felt your light lance through all their scales  Now so we are informed that spear is pointed at the captive maiden s breast and so on to the end reading a bit out of date today May the kind fates deliver Ireland from her friends H M  CORRESPONDENCE  THE CODE OF MINORITY  Everybody is sentimental even Mr Yvor Winters Emily Dickinson he says is dowdy Emerson sentimental Whitman an eventual dull vacuum Sandburg plasmodial delirium I am not used to defending old gods or new ones but I can show I think that these adjectives indicate a sentimentalism that is not only Mr Winters but the characteristic of the larger group of modern noticeable poets It is not expansive Germanic sentimentality to be sure it is protective sentimentality hard and slender But it is no less sentimental for it is based on a conceit on a vain study of approach and manner Its mode is not determined by content  Whether New England hardness which Mr Winters reviews in A Cool Master in the February POETRY is really the hardness that Mr Winters is thinking about is doubtful Whatever its hardness the New England idea is primarily earnest earnest frankly in the content of poetry as Mr Winters to judge from his adjectives can never be When he can say cleverly This man has the culture to know that to those to whom philosophy is comprehensible it is not a matter of first importance and he knows that these people are not greatly impressed by a ballyhoo statement of the principles of social and spiritual salvation it is clear that he is not expounding New England hardness nor anything like it but the   assumed hardness of sophisticated Gallic reaction Poets Emerson Whitman Sandburg in whom the idea content has a burning importance may well seem to him blathering or sentimental or beside the poetic point In them the serious idea is not only an intellectual factor but a definitely esthetic component of the poem Nor does Mr Winters in the face of the overwhelming human response to ideas give any good reason why it should not be Ideas have beauty  Whence this solemn authority that the poet may tell only what he sees not what he thinks It comes from a protective contractile impulse Fear of the world beyond the near perceptions or failure to appreciate is its basis It is safety first in poetry Blunder and bathos threaten the poet who risks being bigger than his sensations and these too often do overwhelm him but the naive exposure that he makes in extending himself beyond protective certainties is necessary He is sentimental perhaps a preacher a philosopher a peddler because he cannot always fuse his own being with that of his subject matter He opens himself as Emerson Whitman and Sandburg unquestionably do to the sarcasm of the tight cool hard poets who take no risks but he also escapes their inevitable minority As a productive unit as an initiative the poet will never be thus pigeonholed All that is humane and interesting is poetic All material waits only the poet with capacity and power to use it   The Code of Minority  A pigeon s wing may make as great an image as a man s tragedy says Mr Winters But the profound truth of the sentence is not the theme that Mr Winters is defending in it Emerson and Whitman or for that matter the Vedas reiterate this truth It is the most beautiful of man s comprehensions and as the identity of all things is the very being of art and life But Mr Winters means nothing of this sort by his pronouncement That would be to sentimentalize to preach and to enter untastefully into the idea content of poetry Mr Winters means by his sentence that greatness lies not in those things of which the poet has written but in the perfect balance the infallible precision with which he has stated their cases  I use Mr Winters for illustration because he reveals rather more articulately than is usually considered good taste in his group the ideational background of probably the larger number of modern poets Theirs is an ungenerous principle from which there can be no great progress It is an assumption for the protection of minority And because these presumed limitations are emotionalized somewhat I am justified I think in calling the hard cool minorists the modern French our American expatriates in England Mr Winters even Wallace Stevens protectively sentimental It is the cult of the craft not of great art  Let me suggest the code First Say little but say it beautifully Second Be delicate nicety is first Third   Be fragmentary it indicates detachment a frail wisp of fact a plaintive inarticulate thread of feeling is enough Fourth Be cool sympathies are vulgar Fifth Be careful the limitations of the poetic milieu are fixed This is the minor code or something like it the world over It is not classical for its restraint has neither the amplitude nor the objectivity of the greater classic school It is an introspective restraint the last reserve of a decayed and romantic egoism It is a hang over I think from ante bellum France The indifferentism assumed by these poets is neither spiritual nor spacious it is the cold chrysalis of individualism from which the butterfly has flown  Devotion not detachment is the foundation of art and devotion these modern minors have not They have ignored the artistic value of ideas They have tatted gracefully in silk but they have hammered no rhythms in steel Ideas even moral ideas and character though abused and betrayed in much Victorian poetry remain primary components of great work They will remain so despite Mr Winters and his perceptualists simply for the reason that their Platonic as well as their human beauty persists  At least two major poets are writing today They are Sandburg and Tagore Different as they are every poem of theirs in its fusion of great and earnest content with personal form denies Mr Winters thesis  Baker Brownell   A New Poetry Society  A NEW POETRY SOCIETY  It would be difficult to enumerate the various evidences of increasing public interest in poetry of at least a desire to give the art closer attention and better appreciation than it has had hitherto The Poetry Lovers of America a society inaugurated last year in Chicago is one such evidence Under the presidency of Mrs D Harry Hammer it has had an auspicious and interesting first season with five or six meetings at which modern poetry was read and discussed from various points of view the history traditions and technique of the art being considered as well as its modern influences and aims The club s correspondence indicates wide interest in the subject and other groups through the Middle West especially show a desire to be affiliated with it The membership of two hundred or more men and women includes both professionals and amateurs F P NOTES  The April number of POETRY will be a Southern Number the contributors representing the south eastern section of the country whose activities in poetry have been encouraged and
