a blinding flash and myles cabot finds himself in the strange ant world

chapter i

the message in the meteor

never had i been so frightened in
all my life it was a warm evening
late in august and i was sitting on
the kitchen steps of my chappaquiddick
island farmhouse discussing the drought
with one of the farm hands suddenly there
appeared in the sky over our heads a flam-
ing fiery mass rushing straight downward
toward us

  heres where a shooting star gets me
i thought as i instinctively ducked my
head just as though such a feeble move
as ducking ones head could afford any

possible protection from the flaming ter-
ror the next instant there came a dull
crash followed by silence which in turn
was broken by the hired man dryly re-
marking i reckon she struck over to
cow hill cow hill was the slight ele-
vation just back of our farmhouse

  so the meteor hadnt been aimed ex-
actly as me after all

  if that thing had hit me some one else
would be giving to the world this story

  we did nothing further about the
meteor that night being pretty well shaken
up by the occurrence but next morning
as soon as the chores were done the hired
man and i hastened to the top of cow

copyrighted  by the frank a munsey co

the other ants stood uncertainly were
they friendly or would they leave him to
his fate

hill to look for signs of last nights fiery
visitor

  and sure enough there were plenty of
signs every spear of grass was singed
from the top of the hill the big rock on
the summit showed marks of a collision
and several splinters of some black igneous
material were lying strewed around lead-
ing from the big rock there ran down the
steep side of the hill a gradually deepen-
ing furrow ending in a sort of caved-in
hole

  we could not let slip such a good oppor-
tunity to get some newspaper publicity for
our farm and so on the following thurs-
day a full account of the meteoric visita-

tion appeared in the vineyard gazette
with the result that quite a number of
summer folks walked across the island
from the bathing beach to look at the
hole

  and there was another result for early
the following week i received a letter from
professor gerrish of the harvard ob-
servatory stating that he had read about
the meteor in the paper and requesting
that  send him a small piece-or if pos-
sible the whole meteor-by express col-
lect for purposes of analysis

  anything for dear old harvard unfor-
tunately all the black splinters had been
carried away by tourists so i set the men


famous fantastic mysteries

to work digging out the main body quite
a hole was dug before we came to the
meteor a black pear-shaped object about
the size of a barrel with rock tongs
chains and my pair of percherons we
dragged this out onto the level i had
hoped that it would be small enough so
that i could send the whole thing up to
harvard and perhaps have it set up in
front of the agassiz moseum marked with
a bronze plate bearing my name but its
size precluded this

  my wife who was present when we
hauled it out remarked it looks just
like a huge black teardrop or raindrop

  and sure enough it did but why not
if raindrops take on a streamline form in
falling why might not a more solid meteor
do so as well but i had never heard of
one doing so before this new idea
prompted me to take careful measurements
and to submit them to professor o d
kellogg of the harvard mathematics de-
partment who was summering at west
chop near by he reported to me that the
form was as perfectly streamlined as it
was possible to conceive but that my sur-
mise as to how it had become so was ab-
surd

while making these measurements
i was attracted by another feature
of the meteor at one place on the side
doubtless where it had struck the big rock
the black coating had been chipped away
disclosing a surface of yellow metal un-
derneath also there was to be seen in this
metal an absolutely straight crack extend-
ing as far as the metal was exposed in a
sidewise direction

  at the time the crack did not attract
me so much as the metal i vaguely won-
dered if it might not be gold but being
reminded of professor gerrishs request
for a sample of the meteor i had one of
the men start chiseling off some pieces

  the natural spot to begin was alongside
of the place where the covering was already
chipped it was hard work but finally he
removed several pieces and then we no-
ticed that the crack continued around the

waist of the meteor as far as had been
chipped this crack from its absolute
regularity gave every indication of being
man-made

  our curiosity was aroused why the
regularity of this crack how far did it
go could it possibly extend clear way
around was it really a threaded joint
and if so how could such a phenomenon
occur on a meteorite dropped from the
sky

  forgotten was the second crop mowing
we had planned to do that day hastily
summoning the rest of the help we set to
work with cold chisels and sledges to re-
move the black coating in a circle around
the middle of the huge teardrop it was a
long and tedious task for the black sub-
stance was harder than anything i had
ever chipped before we broke several
drills and dented the yellow metal unmerci-
fully but not so much so but what we
could see that the threaded crack did actu-
ally persist

  the dinner hour passed and still we
worked unmindful of the appeals of our
womenfolk who finally abandoned us with
much shrugging of shoulders

  it was nearly night when we completed
the chipping and applied two chain
wrenches to try and screw the thing apart
but after all our efforts it would not
budge just as we were about to drop the
wrenches and start to chisel through the
metal some one suggested that we try to
unscrew it as a left-handed screw happy
thought i for in spite of all the dents
which we had made the two ends at last
gradually untwisted

  what warrant did we have to suppose
that there was anything inside it i must
confess now it is all over that we went
through this whole days performance in
a sort of feverish trance with no definite
notion of what we were doing or why
and yet impelled by a crazy fixed idea that
we were on the verge of a great discovery

  and at last our efforts had met with
success and the huge teardrop lay before
us in two neatly threaded parts the in-
side was hollow and was entirely filled with
the radio man



something tightly swathed in silver colored
felt tape

  breathless we unwound over three hun-
dred feet of this silver tape and finally
came to a gold cylinder about the size and
shape of a gingersnap tin-that is to say
a foot long and three inches in diameter
-chased all around with peculiar ara-
besque characters by this time mrs far-
ley and my mother-in-law and the hired
girl had joined us attracted by the shouts
which we gave when the teardrop had come
apart	

  one end of the cylinder easily un-
screwed-also with a left-handed thread-
and i drew forth a manuscript plainly
written in the english language on some
tissue-thin substance like parchment

  every one clustered around me as i
turned to the end to see who it was from
and read with astonishment the following
signature myles s cabot

  but this name meant nothing to anyone
present except myself

  i heard one of the hands remark to an-
other

   twarnt no shootin star at all
nothin but some friend of the boss shoot-
in a letter to him out of one of these here
long-range guns

  maybe so said i to myself

  but mrs farley was quivering with ex-
citement

  you must tell me all about it ralph
said she -who can be sending you a mes-
sage inside a meteor i wonder

  my reply was merely i think that
there is a clipping in one of my scrapbooks
up in the attic which will answer that
question

  there was i found the scrapbook in a
chest under the eaves but did not open
it until after chores and supper during
which meal i kept a provoking silence on
the subject of our discovery

when the dishes were finally all
cleared away i opened the book
on the table and read to the assembled
household the following four-year-old clip-
ping from the boston post

citizen disappears

prominent clubman vanishes from
beacon street home

  myles s cabot of  beacon
street disappeared from his bachelor
quarters late yesterday afternoon un-
der very mysterious circumstances

  he had been working all day in his
radio laboratory on the top floor of
his house and had refused to come
down for lunch when called to dinner
he made no reply so his butler finally
decided to break down the door which
was locked

  the laboratory was found lo be
empty all the windows were closed and
locked and the key was on the inside
of the door in a heap on the floor lay
a peculiar collection of objects consist-
ing of mr cabots watch and chain
pocket knife signet ring cuff links
and tic pin some coins a metal belt
buckle two sets of garter snaps some
safety pins a gold pen point a pen
clip a silver pencil some steel buttons
and several miscellaneous bits of metal
there was a smell in the air like one
notices in electric power houses the
fuses on the laboratory power line were
all blown out

  the butler immediately phoned to
police headquarters and detective
flynn was dispatched lo the scene he
questioned all the servants thoroughly
and confirmed the foregoing facts

  the police are still working on the
case

was prominent radio
enthusiast

  myles s cabot whose mysterious
disappearance yesterday has shocked
boston society was the only son of the
late alden cabot his mother was a
sears of southboro

  the younger cabot since his gradua-
tion from harvard had devoted himself
to electrical experimenting although
prominent in the social life of the city
and an active member of the union
university new york yacht and mid-
dlesex hunt clubs he nevertheless had
found lime to invent novel and useful
radio dcvices among the best known of
which is the indestructo vacuum tube

  he had established at his beacon
street residence one of the best
equipped radio laboratories in the city

  his most recent experiment accord-
ing to professional friends had been
with television


famous fantastic mysteries

     mr cabot substituted two circuits
  for the usual television circuit one
  controlling the vertical lines of his
  sending and receiving screens and the
  other the horizontal thus enabling him
  to enlarge his screen considerably and
  also to present a continuous picture in-
  stead of one made up of dots the
  effect of perspective he obtained by
  adding a third circuit

     the details of this invention had not
   been given out by mr cabot prior to
   his disappearance

     his nearest relatives are cousins

  the last was a particularly gentle touch
it seemed to me well his cousins hadnt
yet inherited his property although they
had tried mighty hard and perhaps this
mysterious message from the void would
prevent them from ever doing so i hoped
that this would be the case for i liked
myles and had never liked those cousins
of his

  myles had been a classmate of mine
at harvard though later our paths drifted
apart his leading into back bay society
and radio and mine leading into the quiet
pastoral life of a farm on chappaquiddick
island off the coast of massachusetts i
had heard little of him until i read the
shocking account of his sudden disappear-
ance

  the police had turned up no further
clues and the matter had quickly faded
from the public sight i had kept the post
clipping as a memento of my old college
chum

  i was anxious to learn what had become
of him these four years past so i opened
the manuscript and proceeded to read
aloud

  in the following chapters i shall give the
story contained in that manuscript-a
story so weird and yet so convincingly
simple that it cannot fail to interest all
those who knew myles cabot it com-
pletely clears up the mystery surrounding
his disappearance of course there will
be some who will refuse to believe that
this story is the truth but those of his
classmates and friends who knew him well
will find herein unmistakable internal evi-
dence of myles cabots hand in this nar-

rative conveyed to me in the golden heart

of a meteorite

chapter ii

stranded in space

hus wrote myles cabot

my chief line of work since graduat-
ing from harvard was on the subject of
television by simultaneously using three
sending sets and three receiving sets each
corresponding to one of the three dimen-
sions any olapct which i placed within
the framework of my transmitter could
be seen within the framework of my re-
ceiver just as though it stood there itself

   all that prevented the object from actu-
ally being made to stand there was the
quite sufficient fact that no one had yet
so far as i was then aware invented a
means for dissolving matter into its well-
known radiations and then converting
these radiations back into matter again

   but at just this time by a remarkable
coincidence there came into my hands a
copy of an unpublished paper on tnis sub-
ject by rene flambeau

   the prior experiments of de gersdorff
are well known he had succeeded by means
of radio waves in isolating and dis-
tinguishing the electro-magnetic constitu-
ents of all the different chemical elements
flambeau went one step further and was
able to transmit small formless quantities
of matter itself although for some reason
certain metals but not their salts appeared
to absorb the electrical energy employed
by him and thus be immune to transpor-
tation

   as i could already transmit a three-
dimensional picture of an object and as
 flambeau had been able to transmit form-
less matter then by combining our devices
in a single apparatus i found i could
transmit physical objects unchanged in
form

  but this apparatus produced one un-
expected phenomenon-namely that when-
ever i employed excessive power my send-
ing set would transmit objects placed
slightly outside its normal range and cer-
the radio man



tain small quantities thereof would turn
up in other portions of my laboratory than
within my receiving set

  to test this phenomenon further i se-
cured some high voltage equipment and
arranged with the edison company for its
use

  on the afternoon when the installation
was completed i started to place a small
blue china vase in position to send it
something must have become short-
circuited for there came a blinding flash
and i knew no more

how long the unconsciousness lasted
i have no means of telling i was
a long time regaining my senses but when
i had finally and fully recovered i found
myself lying on a sandy beach beside a
calm and placid lake and holding in my
hand the small blue vase

  the atmosphere was warm moist and
fragrant like that of a hothouse and the
lap-lapping of the waves gave forth such
a pleasing musical sound that i lay where
i was and dozed off and on even after
i had recovered consciousness

  i seemed to sense rather than really
to see my surroundings the sand was
very white the sky was completely over-
clouded at a far height and yet the clouds
shone with such a silvery radiance that
the day was as bright as any which i had
ever seen with full sunlight on earth but
with a difference for here the light diffused
from all quarters giving the shadowless
effect which one always notes in a pho-
tographers studio

  to my right lay the lake reflecting the
silvery color of the sky before me
stretched the beach unbroken save for an
occasional piece of driftwood to my left
was the upland covered with a thicket of
what at first appeared to be dead trees
but on closer scrutiny were seen to be
some gigantic species of the well-known
branched gray lichen with red tips which
i used to find on rocks and sticks in the
woods as a child

  no birds were flying overhead i suppose
because there were no birds to fly i fell

to wondering vaguely and pleasantly
where i was and how i got there but
for the moment i remained a victim of
complete amnesia

  suddenly however my ears were jarred
by a familiar sound at once my senses
cleared and i listened intently to the dis-
tant purring of a motor yes there could
be no mistake-an airplane was approach-
ing now i could see it a speck in the
sky far down the beach

  nearer and nearer it came

  i sprang to my feet and to my intense
surprise found that the effort threw me
quite a distance into the air instantly the
thought flashed through my mind i must
be on mars but no for my weight was
not nearly enough lighter than my earthly
weight to justify such a conclusion

  for some reason my belt buckle and
most of the buttons which held my clothes
together were missing so that my cloth-
ing came to pieces as i arose and i had
to shed it rapidly in order to avoid im-
peding my movements i wondered at the
cause of this

  but my speculations were cut short by
the alighting of the airplane a hundred
yards down the beach it seemed to land
vertically rather than run along the
ground but i could not be sure at that
distance what was my horror when out of
it clambered not men but ants ants six-
footed and six feet high huge ants four
of them running toward me over the
glistening sands

  gone was all my languor as i seized a
piece of driftwood and prepared to defend
myself as well as i could the increase in
my jumping ability although slight
coupled with an added buoyancy enabled
me to prolong the unequal encounter

  the ants came slowly forward four
abreast like a cavalry formation while
i awaited their onslaught grasping the
stick of driftwood firmly in my hand
when nearly upon me they executed right-
by-troopers and started circling in an ever-
narrowing circle

  suddenly the ants wheeled and con-
verged from all four points of the compass


famous fantastic mysteries

clicking their mandibles savagely as they
came the whole movement had been exe-
cuted with uncanny precision without a
single word of communication between
the strange black creatures in fact with-
out a single sound except the clicking of
their mandibles and a slight rattling of
their joints how like a naval attack by
a fleet of old-fashioned ford cars i
thought

  when within about ten feet of me they
made a concerted rush but i leaped to
one side at the same time giving one of
my antagonists a crack with my club as
they crashed together in the center this
denouement seemed to confuse them for
they slowly extricated themselves from
their tangle and withdrew for a short dis-
tance where they again formed and stood
glaring at me for a few minutes clicking
their jaws angrily

  then they rushed again this time in
close formation but again i jumped to
one side dealing another blow with my
club whereupon the fighting became dis-
organized the ants making individual
rushes and i leaping and whacking as
best i could

  i scored several dents in the armor of
my opponents and finally succeeded by a
lucky stroke in beheading one of them but
at this the other three came on with re-
newed vigor although each ant wore some
sort of green weapon slung in a holster
at its side they fought only with their
mandibles

   the slight difference in gravity from that
to which i had been accustomed finally
proved my undoing for although it in-
creased my agility it also rendered me
a bit less sure on my feet and this was
enhanced by the rapid disintegration of
the soles of my shoes the result was that
at last i slipped and fell and was immedi-
ately set upon and pinned down by my
enemies one of the ants at once deliber-
ately nipped me in the side with his huge
mandibles an excruciating pain shot
through my entire body and then for
the second time that day i lost conscious-
ness

when i came to i found myself
lying in the cockpit of an airplane
speeding through the sky one of my ant
captors was standing on a slight incline
at the bow of the ship operating the con-
trol levers with his front feet and the
other two were watching the scenery the
dead ant was nowhere to be seen no one
was paying any attention to me

  i was not bound and yet i was unable
to move my senses were unusually keen
and yet my body was completely para-
lyzed i had no idea as to what sort of
country we were flying over for i could not
raise my head above the edge of the cock-
pit i didnt know where i was going but
i certainly was on my way all right and
not so all right at that

  overhead was the same silvery glare
without a patch of blue sky no sound
came from my sinister indifferent captors
the only noise was the throbbing of the
motors

  as to the time of day or how long
i had been on board i had no idea and
what was more i didnt particularly care
rather a pleasant sort of a jag if it were
not for the intense pain of lickering-up

  after a while the pleasant sensation wore
off and my throat began to feel dry i tried
to call to the ants but of course could
not because of the paralysis and finally
desisted even the attempt when i remem-
bered that the ants were speechless and
hence probably unable to hear

  by a coincidence however one of the
creatures seemed to sense my needs and
brought me some water in a bowl gently
holding up my head with one of his fore-
paws so that i could drink this action
touched my heart and also filled me with
hope that the ants might not turn out
to be such bad captors after all

  then i fell to studying them first of
all i noticed that each ant carried on the
back of his thorax a line of peculiar white
characters somewhat like shorthand writ-
ting and below it several rows of similar
writing only smaller in size

  the peculiar green-colored weapon
slung in a holster on the right-hand side of
the radio man



each ant i had already noticed during
the fight but apart from the white marks
and the green weapons my captors were
absolutely naked and so far as i could see
they were exactly like the ordinary black
ants to which i had been accustomed on
earth only of course magnified to an
enormous size

  i studied the faces which the ants now
occasionally turned toward me these faces
were sinister and terrifying they recalled
to my memory the fright which i had once
had when as a child i attended an ento-
mological movie and was suddenly con-
fronted with a close-up of the head of some
common insect

  but the ant who had brought me the
water had a human look which relieved him
of much of his terrible grimness in fact
he struck me as vaguely familiar ah now
i had it a certain stolidity of movement
amounting almost to a mannerism re-
minded me of one of my harvard class-
mates a homely good-hearted boy whom
we had all known by the nickname of
doggo and so from then on i in-
stinctively thought of that particular ant
as named doggo

  then for the first time it struck me
as strange that these ants instead of scut-
tling aimlessly over the ground or having
wings of their own to fly with as in the
mating season on earth were utilizing a
carefully and scientifically built airplane
apparently of their own make and it
struck me as even more strange that i had
not wondered about this before

  but then the events of that day had oc-
curred with such startling rapidity-from
the flash in my beacon street laboratory
through my awakening beside that strange
lake the approach of the airplane my fight
with the ants and my second lapse from
consciousness down to my present predica-
ment-that i was to be excused for not
considering any particular phase of my
adventures as being more extraordinary
than any other

  now however that i had had time to
draw my breath and collect my thoughts
it dawned on me with more and more

force that here i was apparently on some
strange planet of which the ruling race
apparently of human or superhuman in-
telligence were not men and they were
not even some other mammal but were in-
sects-ants to be more specific for all
that i knew i was the only mammal-or
perhaps even vertebrate-on this entire
planet

  then i remembered a remark by pro-
fessor parker in zoology i in my freshman
year at harvard the two peaks of de-
velopment in the chain of evolution from
the amoeba upward are the order of hy-
menoptera bees wasps and ants among
insects and the order of primates men
and monkeys among mammals in any
other world it is probable that evolution
would produce a ruling race in much the
same way that man has been produced
upon the earth and it is a toss-up whether
this mling race would develop along the 
lines of the hymenoptera or in a form
similar to the mammals but one or the
other seems inevitable

  well said i to myself old parker
is certainly vindicated at least with respect
to one planet

  thus i mused as the airplane sped
along then the purr of the motors lulled
me to sleep and for the third time that
day i became unconscious

when i awoke the sky was losing its
luminous silver quality on one side
it was faintly pink and on the other the
silver color merged into a duller gray the
airship still sped along

  doggo brought me another bowl of
water and i found to my joy that i
could now iift my head enough to drink
without any further assistance than to
have doggo hold the bowl at this sign
of recovery one of the other ants ad-
vanced menacingly as if to bite me again
but doggo jumped between us and after
much snapping of mandibles and quivering
of antenna by both the other ant de-
sisted

  this event decided me that doggo was
a friend worth cultivating but i was at


famous fantastic mysteries

a loss how to make advances which would
be understood finally however i de-
termined to attempt stroking the huge
ant in a way which i had found to be
very effective in making friends with ani-
mals

  accordingly when doggo came near
enough by a great effort i overcame my
paralysis sufficiently to reach up and touch
him on the side of his head just behind
one of his great jaws apparently this
pleased the ant for he submitted to the
caress and finally lifted me to a sitting
position so that the patting could be con-
tinued with greater ease

  i later learned that this patting to
which i had resorted purely by accident
is a universal custom of this planet corre-
sponding to shaking hands on earth and
signifying greetings friendship farewell
bargain binding and the like

  the other ant man occasionally would
advance menacingly toward me with his
head lowered but each time doggo would
step between us lower his own head and
agitate his antenna at which the other
would desist i nicknamed the other satan
because of his diabolical actions

  in my new sitting position i was now
able to see over the side of the airship
we were passing above gray woods with
occasional silver-green fields in which were
grazing some sort of pale green animals
too far below to be easily distinguishable
through the woods and fields ran what
appeared to be roads but as nothing was
moving on them i could not tell for sure

  suddenly my attention was distracted
from the view by the frantic action of the
ant man who was steering the ship he
seemed to be having difficulty with his
controls and then so quickly that it gave
us no warning the ship reared up in the
air and made a complete loop that is

i merely suppose it made a complete one
for when the loop was half done i dropped
out and fell like a plummet through the
air

  i remember a momentary exultation at
being free from my captors and a certain
spiteful joy at the thought thatl should

undoubtedly be dashed to pieces and thus
rob them of their prey then i had just
begun to wonder whether i shouldnt pre-
fer captivity to death when i struck- -

  and was not dashed to pieces

   i still lived for i had been thrown slant-
wise into a net of some sort and was how
swaying gently back and forth like a slow-
ing pendulum hooray i was both fref
and safe

   but my joy was short lived for i soon
discovered that the fine silken strands
of the net were covered with a substance
like sticky fly paper which held me firmly
the more i struggled the more i drew
other strands of the net toward me to en-
tangle me at last i paused for breath
and then the truth dawned on me i was
caught in a gigantic spider web and
sure enough there came the spider toward
me from one corner of the web

   he wasnt a very large spider that is
to say judging by the size of my previous
captors i should have expected that the
spiders of this world would be as big as the
eifel tower he was quite large enough
however having a body about the size
of my own and legs fully ten feet long
i call him a spider for that is the earth
word which comes closest to describing
him

   with great assiduity he began wrapping
me up into a cocoon a process which he
seemed to enjoy much more than i but
it did me no good to struggle for any
part of me which showed any indications
of moving was immediately pinioned with
a fresh strand of rope

   at last the job was finished and i was
completely enveloped with a layer of thick
coarse sticky silk cloth translucent but
not transparent

chapter iii

out of the frying pan

when i had dropped from the air-
plane into the spider web the time
had been nearly evening all night off and
on i struggled but to no avail finally
shortly after daylight something startled
the radio man



me by falling-plop-into the net close
beside me another victim thought i well
at least i should have company

  but this other creature was not any more
inclined to take its captivity calmly than i
had been it thrashed and struggled vio-
lently until finally it tore a rent in the
upper end of my shroud so that i could
see out

  my companion in misery was an orange-
and-black-striped bee about the size of a
horse he was buzzing frantically and
slashing about with his sting while the
spider hopped around him with great
agility dodging the thrusts of the sting
and applying a strand of silk here and
there whenever an opportunity offered
thus gradually the bees freedom of mo-
tion became less and less as strand after
strand were added to his bonds

  but the spider getting bolder as his
captives struggles diminished finally mis-
judged one thrust and the imprisoned bee
putting all his effort into the stroke drove
his sting home the spider toppled from
the web and the fight was unexpectedly
at an end

  and now the bee and i were free if
we only could get free of the two of us
i had the easier task for my cocoon had
dried during the night and was now no
longer sticky but it was still very tough

  slowly inch by inch biting clawing
tearing i gradually enlarged the hole near
my head until finally i was able to step
out and jump to the ground which was
about ten feet away a drop equivalent
to a little less than eight feet on the earth
not much difference it is true but every
little bit helped

  i now decided to assist my rescuer the
bee to escape a rash decision one would
say and yet the bee seemed to realize that
i was helping him for not once did he
strike at me picking up a tree branch
i hacked at the cords which bound him
until finally he was able to fly away trail-
ing a large section of the web after him

  as he left i noticed that one fif his
hind legs was gone from the knee down
and that he bore a peculiar scarlike mark

on the under side of his abdomen i should
know him if ever i were to meet him

again

  the web had been stretched between
two large gray leafless trees of the sort
i had observed near the beach but with-
out the red tips to the branches near by
was a wood of similar but slightly smaller
trees bordering on a field of thickly matted
silver-green grass very similar to earth
grass except in color in this field were
grazing a herd of pale green insects a little
larger than sheep with long trailing an-
tenna

  these creatures swayed from side to
side lifting first one foot after another as
they munched the matted grass on the
sides of some of them clung one or more
bright red parasites resembling lobsters in
size and appearance but their green hosts
did not seem to mind or even notice them
nor did they notice me for that matter
as i passed between them across the field

  on the further side of the field was a
road built of concrete resembling in every
way such concrete roads as we have on
the earth and along it i set out whither
i knew not

  now i had had nothing to eat since
i found myself on the sandy beach the
previous morning also i had fought two
battles on an empty stomach the day was
hot and moist my feet were bare-as was
the rest of me-and i felt discouraged and
depressed still i trudged along

  can it be true said i that only
yesterday i rejoiced at freedom from the
ant men

  now i was alone and lost-lost on a
strange planet oh how i longed for the
sight of my late captors better even cap-
tivity than this

  for a while the road ran between silver-
green fields then entered a wood on the
gaunt gray trees hung a tangle of tropical
vines and between the trees grew some
kind of small shrub with large heart-shaped
leaves on each leaf of which there sat
motionless one or more purple grasshop-
pers about four inches in length

  in the distance i occasionally caught


famous fantastic mysteries

sight of some strange sort of bird-as i
thought-flitting in tandem pairs from
tree to tree a multitude of tiny lizards
resembling miniature kangaroos hopped
about on the concrete and by the side of
the road

for a while the strange fauna and
flora stimulated my curiosity and kept
my mind off my troubles but then i rap-
idly lost interest in everything my stom-
ach gnawed my knees wabbled my mind
began to cloud and from that time on
i wandered as in a dream for i know
not how many hours

  i vaguely remember falling on the road-
way and then crawling along for a while
silly thoughts obsessed my brain such as
wondering whether my tail light was lit
and what made the weather so foggy
finally i collapsed utterly and had just
strength enough to drag myself off the
concrete lest i be run over by some pass-
ing car

  as i lay there in the bushes by the
side of the road there came to my nostrils
a smell which partially revived me-a smell
seemingly of griddle cakes and maple
syrup opening my eyes again and follow-
ing my nose i discovered that this pleas-
ant odor emanated from a large bowl-
shaped leaf only a few feet away

  upon dragging myself toward it i dis-
covered that in the bottom of the bowl
there was a brown mass looking very much

like a stack of wheats covered with some
sticky substance but unfortunately this
delectable dish was quite obscured by little
hopping lizards now much bemired and
hopping no more

  so i reached out my hand to brush them
away and instantly the leaf closed upon
my arm like a steel trap

  my brain cleared at once and i began
a frantic struggle to extricate my hand
but it was too late for with a gentle mas-
saging motion the plant commenced to
swallow my arm

  inch by inch my arm descended into
that rapacious maw it was the steady
slowness of the procedure that was so
nerve-wracking for without a pause my
arm disappeared at a rate of about an
inch a minute

  i braced my feet against the plant and
pulled but this cut off the circulation in
my arm then i wiggled my fingers rap-
idly so as to keep my hand from going
to sleep whereupon the plant swallowed
all the faster some ants stood watching

  the mouth of the plant had closed very
much like a clam shell so just before my
shoulder disappeared i braced my body
crosswise of the jaws in the hope that
this maneuver would prevent the swallow-
ing process from proceeding any further

  but the plant merely opened its flexible
lips and closed them the other way tak-
ing a firm grip on my chest and just miss-
ing getting hold of my right ear i craned

my neck as far as i could to the left and
shrieked aloud with terror

  was it for this that i had escaped the
ant men and the spider-to be eaten
alive by a plant

  the soft jaws now fastened on the back
of my head and began gently drawing
that in too at last only my nose was
free in a minute that too would be en-
veloped then strangulation and death

  at this moment something fell upon me
and i felt the plant quiver and shake the
swallowing ceased then the soft lips were
torn away from one side of my head and
i heard a familiar rattling sound

  a few seconds later the plant went limp
releasing my arm and i lay upon my
back free once more gazing upward into
the eyes of my old friend and captor

  doggo doggo-i cried with joy but
he did not seem to hear me nevertheless
he picked me up gently in his mandibles
and trotted off with me down the road

  alter about a quarter of a mile we
turned aside into a field and there was
satan the other ant man standing beside
a crumpled airship and the dead body
of its pilot satan did not seem overjoyed
to see me but doggo rummaged through
the wreckage and finally produced a bowl
into which he put water and some medi-
cine which revived me greatly then he
laid me on a pile of grass covered me with
leaves and stood guard over me as the
pink twilight deepened and the night fell

  as it began to grow dark i could hear
an occasional tinkle like the sound of a
japanese wind bell first on one side and
then on another this music gradually in-
creased until it assumed the volume of
a fairy orchestra i had never heard such
dainty bewitching tunefulness in my entire
life many weeks later i learned that this
was the song of the large purple grass-
hoppers i had seen but even the knowl-
edge of its source has never robbed the
sound of its sweet mystery for me

  the fading silver radiance of the sky
shed a moonlike light over all below a
faint breeze sprang up gently fanning
the moist fragrant hot-house air against

my cheeks the foliage around us waved
like a sea of silver grain and the tune
of that elfin melody quickly lulled me into
a soft and dreamless sleep secure in the
confidence that a faithful friend was watch-
ing near

the next morning i was awakened by
doggo stripping off my leafy coverlet
satan was not to be seen but grazing near
us were some more of those peculiar large
green insects with long trailing antenna
which i had seen in my flight from the
spider web

  as i sat up doggo presented me with
a bowl of pale green liquid but i was
at a loss to know what to do with it was
i supposed to wash in it or to drink it
or to rub it in my hair

   my friend solved the question by lift-
ing it to my mouth so i drank and found
the taste to be sweetish and agreeable

  all morning we stayed by the wrecked
machine apparently waiting for something
satan did not show up around noon
doggo took the bowl and approached one
of the green beasts grazing near i followed
with interest

  two horns projected upwardly from the
tail of the beast one of which doggo pro-
ceeded to stroke with his paw and to my
surprise a green liquid spouted from the
animal quickly filling the bowl so that
is where my breakfast had come from
green milk from green cows strange
and yet how much more logical than on
earth where a red cow eats green grass
under a blue sky and produces white
milk from which we get yellow butter

   shortly after lunch i heard the hum of
a motor and presently satan landed near
us with a new plane this strange plane
of the ant men stopped abruptly hov-
ered for a moment and then settled just
where it was

  doggo carried me aboard and we
started satan at the levers and doggo
standing guard over me but whether this
was to protect me from satan or to keep
me from falling out again i could not
say


famous fantastic mysteries

    we cruised along for several hours over
 much the same sort of country as i had
 seen before except that we crossed several
 rivers and once a small lake

    at last the ship hovered and landed on
 top of what seemed to be a helter-skelter
 pile of exaggerated toy building blocks ex-
 actly in keeping with the size of the ants
 as far as eye could see on all sides these
 blocks were heaped they were apparently
 of concrete and resembled a group of
 pueblo indian dwellings

   doggo and the fierce ant man whom i
 called satan now picked me up in their
 jaws the former gently and the latter not
 so gently and carried me out of the air-
 plane and down an inclined runway into
 - the interior of the edifice the passage was
 long narrow dark and winding but pres-
 ently we emerged into a room about thirty
 feet square by ten feet high lighted by
 narrow windows opening toward the west-
 ern sky that is i call it western for
 it was in this direction that the sky turned
 pink at eventide

   in this room i was laid on the floor
 the unpleasant ant man departed and
 doggo placed himself on guard in the
 doorway

    presently two strange ant men entered
 carrying a couch which they set down in
 one corner of the room then they walked
 several times around me viewing me from
 all sides with evident interest until at
 a stiffening and quivering of doggos an-
 tenna they hurriedly left the room i
 noticed that doggo no longer carried the
 green weapon which seemed strange as
 he was very evidently on guard

   then i fell to wondering about the
 couch it was a simple affair and yet quite
 evidently intended for a bed upholstered
 with some kind of dark blue cloth at that

   what need have ants of a bed mused
 i certainly they cannot lie down and
 even if they could such a couch as this
 would be of little use to one of them for
 this is only a man-size couch whereas these
 ants are about ten feet in length

   my perplexity was tinged with a hope
 that there might be human beings here

  my perplexity and my hope were both
increased by the return of one of the ants
wha had brought the couch this time
bearing a sleeveless shirt or toga of white
matted material like very thin silk felt
reaching about to my knees with a grecian
wave design in light blue around the bot-
tom edge and around the neck and arm-
holes but what increased my perplexity
still further and at the same time de-
stroyed most of my hope was the presence
of two vertical slits with the same blue
trimming in the upper part of the back

  the two ant man watched with great
interest while i put this toga on and were
evidently pleased to find that i knew how
to do so the messenger ant then with-
drew and presently returned with a bowl
of green milk which i drank as usual

   by this time it had become quite dark
outside but the room still remained light
due to two long glass bulbs set in the
ceiling and containing some sort of in-
candescent substance at that time i little
guessed what a part those bulbs would
come to play in my life they resembled
mercury vapor lamps except that in-
stead of shining with a marked purple or
green light they gave forth a radiance
indistinguishable from daylight doubtless
due to the substitution of some other gas
for mercury vapor

   these lamps showed that the inhabitants
of this planet were well advanced in elec-
trical engineering was it not strange
then that they had not developed radio
and communicated with the earth and
yet not so strange either when one con-
siders that they had no sense of hearing

  dismissing these thoughts from my
mind i lay down on the couch then
doggo was relieved as sentinel by a new
ant man who carefully and inquisitively
inspected me but from a safe distance
this guard too was without any green
weapon

   finally the two lights went out and i
slept my last thoughts being to wonder
what was in store for me and what was
the significance of the couch and the
strange blue-and-white article of clothing

chapter iv

  go to the ant thou sluggard

as i slowly awakened the next morn-
ing i vaguely remembered a terrible
nightmare of the night before

  but no it was no dream for i opened
my eyes upon the same plain concrete
room with its slit windows i was lying
on the same couch the same strange ant
man was standing guard at the door dur-
ing the night some one had placed over
me a blanket of some sort of light fleecy
wool felt

  as i lay in bed i studied the walls of
the room and noticed what i had not
seen before three dials sunk in the opposite
wall close to the ceiling each dial had
twelve numbers or letters around the edge
and also a single pointer the pointer of
the right dial was slowly revolving left-
handedly the pointer of the middle dial
was turning even more slowly while that
of the left dial appeared motionless ab-
sent-mindedly i started to time the right-
hand pointer

  one chimpanzee two chimpanzee
three chimpanzee i counted in sing-
song that being a formula which i had
been taught as a child to count the time
between a lightning flash and the result-
ing thunder in order to estimate the dis-
tance of the stroke

  for if carefully done each chimpanzee
equaled one second of time and each sec-
ond meant one quarter-mile of distance
of course the real object of the game was
to distract the childs mind from his fear
of the lightning

  i now found that it took about fifty
chimpanzees for the right pointer to move
one of the twelve graduations this fact
i verified by several trials

  i fell to wondering what the device was
for

  it looked and acted like a gas meter
or electric meter

  then i dismissed the meter from my
mind and considered my predicament
for some reason i thought of my father
alden cabot now many years dead the

old man had been a stern puritanical char-
acter abhorring sloth and frivolity

  how often had i heard him rebuke
some act of laziness with his favorite bibli-
cal quotation go to the ant thou slug-
gard consider her ways and be wise

  wouldnt father be pleased thought
i for i have certainly gone to the ant
all right but the big question now is how
to get away from them

  by this time the sentinel noticed that
i was awake and immediately brought me
my breakfast consisting of a bowl of the
sweet green liquid and a bowl of dark
reddish-brown paste about the consistency
of mashed beans and having a rich flavor
not unlike beef gravy

  after breakfast doggo took his turn as
guard i patted his head and then went
over to the windows to see the view if
any

  the windows overlooked a courtyard
completely enclosed by piled-up pueblo
buildings in the yard was a fountain sur-
rounded by beds of plants quite unlike
any that i had ever seen before the pre-
vailing color of the foliage was gray and
silver green many of the twigs bore knobs
of red or purple and a few of the plants
had brilliantly colored blue and yellow
flowers somewhat similar to those of
dandelions

  for a long time i aimlessly gazed upon
this beautiful garden the warm moist
fragrant atmosphere was not conducive
to lurry or to excitement but finally even
the beauties of the view palled upon me
and i returned to the blue couch

  just then doggo ushered into the room
with great deference four ant men slightly
smaller than himself but more refined
looking than he if one can appreciate such
differences among ants that is they were
more slender and delicate like machines
built for precision rather than for strength

  they evidently were a bit afraid of me
for after eying me furtively from the door
they appeared to confer with doggo
though not an audible word passed be-
tween them to assure them that i was
perfectly harmless doggo walked over


famous fantastic mysteries

to me and permitted himself to be patted
after which the committee drew near and
inspected me carefully agitating their an-
tenna at each newly discovered peculiarity

  they appeared chiefly perplexed by my
forehead and my back to examine which
they lifted up my toga they counted my
fingers several times and then counted
my toes

  but the thing about me which amazed
them the most was my ears these they
studied for a long time with much in-
audible consultation as i judged by the
motions of their antenna

  finally they took their departure and
doggo came to me bristling with excite-
ment and apparently having much im-
portant information to impart but alas
he did not know my language and he had
no language at all i patted him again
but this time it did not soothe him for
he broke away from me impatiently and
returned to his station by the door

left to myself i fell to studying the
meter again watching the counter-
clockwise rotation of its hands even the
left pointer had moved a bit since early
morning

  now i noticed what i might have sur-
mised on the analogy of an earthly gas
meter that each graduation of the central
dial represented one complete revolution
of the pointer on its right and this prin-
ciple presumably extended to the dial on
its left then i counted chimpanzees again
and found that the right hand pointer was
still rotating counterclockwise at the rate
of about fifty chimpanzees per graduation
countercocwise why perhaps this ma-
chine was a clocki

  i made a hasty mental calculation one
graduation equals fifty seconds twelve
graduations-one complete rotation-equal
six hundred seconds-ten minutes thus
one graduation of the middle dial repre-
sents ten minutes and its complete circuit
represents two hours by the same token
a complete circuit of the left dial would
represent twenty-four hours-one day

  my guess was apparently correct

   at that time it did not occur to me as
strange that a day on this planet should
be twenty-four hours as on earth

   the figure to the left of the top of each
dial was a single horizontal line presum-
ably standing for unity for a single line
either horizontal or vertical is the almost
universal symbol for unity

   then said i the next figure must
be two the next figure three and so
on around to twelve eureka i can now
count up to twelve with these creatures
thus establishing in writing at least the
beginning of a possible basis of communi-
cation

  eager to test my newfound knowledge
i beckoned to doggo he came to my side

   scratching the ant figure five upon the
floor with a small pebble which i found
in a corner-for i could not reach the dials
to point to their figures-i held up five
fingers the effect was electrical greatly
excited doggo rushed to the door but
pausing on the threshold he returned held
up three legs looking at me almost be-
seechingly as i thought and when i
wrote an ant figure three on the floor his
joy knew no bounds he patted me on the
side of my head for a moment to show
his appreciation and then rushed once
more from the room

   and now for the first time i was left
unguarded but i had no thought of
escape in the first place because it would
be unfair to my friend and in the sec-
ond because escape merely from the room
would be useless

   presently doggo returned with the com-
mittee of four and put me through my
paces he would hold up a certain num-
ber of legs and i would scratch the cor-
responding character upon the pavement
finally as a crowning stunt i wrote down
five and six pointed to them and then
wrote down eleven the committee were
much impressed

   then doggo had me put on and take ofl
my toga for them evidently he was try-
ing to convince them i was a reasoning
human being like themselves though what
the disrobing performance had to do with
the radio man



it i could not see for the life of me

  at last the committee left and after
that a very nice luncheon was served
more green milk some baked cakes and
honey real honest to goodness honey like
we have on earth you cant appreciate
how these little touches of similarity to
good old terra firma appealed to me
thoroughly homesick after three whole
days absence

  after luncheon doggo brought me a
pad of paper and a pointed stick like a
skewer with its tip incased in some lead-
like metal this stick could thus be used
as a pencil he himself was similarly
equipped except that his pencil had a
strap for attachment to his left front claw
the difference between the two pencils
attracted my attention and excited my
wonder but i could hot account for it

   instruction began at once i would point
to some object doggo would make marks
on his pad and then i would copy them
on mine adding the name in english
these additions puzzled and annoyed my
instructor but i persisted for otherwise
i might early forget the meaning of his
scratch marks

  when a vocabulary of about twenty con-
crete nouns had been accumulated doggo
took away my sheet and then pointed to
the articles in turn while i wrote down
their ant names as well as i could re-
member them fortunately i have a good
visual memory for i was no more able
to invent sounds for the ant words than
i would have been able to read aloud a
chinese laundry ticket

  after several hours of this absorbing
sport doggo produced a book with rare
presence of mind i figure that as ant
men wrote with their left hands and had
counterclockwise clocks their books would
probably begin at the wrong end so ac-
cordingly i opened at the back and sure
enough the last page was numbered one
this proof of my intelligence pleased my
instructor greatly

  on page one was the picture of an ant
man under it was printed the word which
doggo had given me as equivalent to him-

self next came the same word followed
by a strange word then these two words
were repeated followed by two others

  reasoning by the analogy of my primary
school days at home i decided that these
words were ant man an ant man this
is an ant man but i was wrong for on
this basis the next line made no sense
for reading from right to left the next
line would be an ant man is this

  oh i had it ant man the ant man

i see the ant man the ant man sees me
to test it i wrote down the word for
i and pointed to myself doggo who
had been watching me intently as i studied
the page now showed unmistakable signs
of pleasure at this evidence of my intelli-
gence and departing soon returned with
a large furry beetlelike creature about
two feet square called a buntlote-so
i learned later-which he set on the floor
before me with every expectation of ex-
treme gratitude on my part i tried to ap-
pear grateful but could not figure out
what i was supposed to do with the beast

  the buntlote however had much more
definite views on the subject for he ambled
over to me and patted me on the side with
one of his front paws i looked inquir-
ingly at doggo who indicated that i was
supposed to feed the buntlote with some
of the remains of my luncheon which
was still sitting on the couch

the buntlote after satisfying his
hunger curled up in a corner and went
to sleep whereupon i returned to my
studies evidently ant men kept pets the
same as humans but whether this bunt-
lote was suppoiid to be a dog or a cat
or what i did not know

  doggo then taught me how to write
buntlote and the words for food mouth
and eat-my first verb by the way-and
so on

  by supper time i was in a position to
carry on a very elementary conversation
with my instructor but only by pad and
pencil of course for not a word or a
sound had i ever heard him utter

  and since their speech was not articu-


famous fantastic mysteries

late their written language could not of
course be phonetic it must be ideo-
graphic like the chinese the fact that
each word consisted in but a single char-
acter lent color to this surmise

  and yet i noticed that all of the char-
acters which i had so far learned could
be decomposed into distinguishable parts
and that there were only about thirty of
these parts in the aggregate this fact cer-
tainly pointed to a phonetic alphabet of
thirty sounds for it was inconceivable that
these highly cultivated animals possessed
only thirty ideas and yet how could an
unspoken language be phonetic i gave
up the puzzle

  supper came the lights on and my
buntlote uncurled and ambled over to be
fed i decided to regard him as a cat
and so named him tabby

  at this meal doggo joined me and as
we ate my attention was again attracted
to the white marks on his back which to
my surprise i now noticed were exactly
like those on the clock they must be his
license number --

  if the large figures represented his li-
cense number i thought what did the
small figures stand for the license num-
bers of the cars he had run into perhaps

i little guessed how near this came to
being the truth

  that night i went to bed well satisfied
with my progress but alas although
doggo proved to be an indefatigable
teacher i did not get on so well during
the succeeding days

  but i did make progress in one thing
however namely in acquiring a beard
although facilities for washing and bath-
ing were provided in a little alcove off my
room and although a fresh toga was forth-
coming from time to time yet my captors
did not furnish either a razor or a mirror
of course ants have nothing to shave and
they cannot be blamed for not caring to
look at themselves in the glass i tried my
best to explain to doggo what i wanted
but it was no use

  if this manuscript is ever discovered
let the reader try to figure out how to

explain by sign language to a person who
has never seen either a razor or a looking
glass that you want them

  when the beard got well under way the
committee of four were recalled to view it
they were even more impressed with my
beard than they had been with my ears
and made frequent visits to take notes on
its growth

  this convinced me that they had never
before seen any men or at least any unneat
ones and so my hope for human compan-
ionship received another blow yet if there
were no men on this planet how account
for the fact that when i drew a sketch
of a table and a chair these were at once
forthcoming together with a written name
for each

  of course all my time was not spent in
lessons sometimes i played with tabby
and sometimes i took long walks gradu-
ally i became more of a guest than a
prisoner or even a curiosity and so i was
given the run of the entire city which was
built as one large connected house a verit-
able jumble of rooms passageways ramps
and courtyards

  but this freedom nearly proved my un-
doing

  one day when i had strolled unusually
far from my own quarters i met my old
enemy satan in one of the courtyards
instinctively i shrunk back but he gave
every indication of wishing to be friendly
even to the extent of turning his head on
one side to be patted distasteful as the
act was to me i decided that discretion
was the better part of valor and so patted
him gingerly

   apparently as a reward for this service
he beckoned me to follow him and so
i did through many a winding corridor
our way finally led to the outskirts of the
city to a grating guarded by a sentinel
whom satan promptly relieved when the
old guard had gone satan to my great
surprise opened the gate and motioned
me to step out

  this was indeed a favor for although
i had been able to get plenty of fresh air
in the courtyard flower gardens and on
the radio man



the roofs yet i had felt cramped and re-
strained and had longed for the freedom
of a run in the open fields so patting him
again to show my gratitude i rushed out
and turned several handsprings for joy on
the silver sward

  as i regained my feet what should i
see to my dismay but a squad of ant men
issuing from the gate and rushing toward
me at full speed with satan at their head
his savage jaws snapping with hate i
stood astounded for a moment and then
turned and fled

  at an earthly speed of running a man
would have little hope of distancing one of
these creatures but the added buoyancy of
this strange planet gave me a slight ad-
vantage over them until i had the mis-
fortune to stub my toe on something and
fall whereupon the pack closed over me

  the fall stunned me and as my brain
darkened i felt the sharp mandibles of my
enemy fasten upon my throat

chapter v

a vision

the full measure of satans perfidy
was now evident under the guise of
pretended friendship he had lured me to
the city gate and had persuaded me to
step outside then hastily calling a de-
tachment of the guard he had informed
them that i had escaped he had led them
in pursuit of me and my flight had furn-
ished sufficient verification of his accusa-
tion

  so now i was entirely in his power he
was free to kill me without fear of the con-
sequences for the whole squad would back
up his story that i had fled and that he
had been forced to slay me for the pur-
pose of preventing my escape

  why he did not bite me at once and
end my life i do not know perhaps he
wished first to gloat over me at any rate
after i came out of my daze he lbosened
his hold on my throat and planting his
front feet upon my prostrate body threw
his head aloft as if singing a pean of vic-
tory although of course no sound came

  then suddenly he sprang away from me
entirely and now i discovered the mean-
ing and use of the peculiar green weapon
which every ant man carried slung in a
holster at his side when out of doors
these supposed weapons were nothing
more nor less than green umbrellas which
satan and the others were now hastily
putting up in very evident terror

  sitting up weakly i tried to figure out
what had so frightened them as to cause
them to desist abruptly from their at-
tack on me but i could discern nothing
except a patch of sunlight the very first
i had seen by the way since my advent on
the planet my late antagonists were ap-
parently watching this-to me-very
pleasant sight with every indication of
extreme fear looking above i saw a
small bit of blue sky

  the patch of sunlight passed close by
me and proceeded toward a small herd of
green cows who were grazing near by
and as it passed among them the shift-
ing of their feet stopped and every cow
on whom the light had rested shuddered
wilted and dropped in evident agony upon
the ground

  then i realized that this planet must
be very close to the center of the solar
system and protected from the intense
heat of the sun only by the dense silvery
clouds which surround it i was now
nearly certain as i had surmised before
from the prevailing silver-gray and the
gravity slightly less than that on earth
that this must be the planet venus

  i was still gazing abstractedly at the
stricken cows in the wake of the solar
heat when i was rudely called to my
senses by the ant pack closing over me
once more and once again the mandibles
of satan fastened on my throat

  but the best laid plans of mice and men
-and even ant men-gang aft aglee with
all his clever scheming satan had made
one fatal mistake he had reckoned with-
out the faithful doggo as satans jaws
were about to pierce my jugular again
he dropped me and stood at attention
as if in response to a peremptory com-


famous fantastic mysteries

mand from a military superior i looked
up and saw that the rest of the guard were
also standing at attention while rapidly
approaching us from the city gate came
my old friend doggo with antenna erect
and quivering once more he had saved
my life

  how i regretted the blows which i had
struck him in the fight at the beach on my
first day upon this planet and how glad
i was that his had not been the head which
i had severed in that spirited encounter

   presently as if in response to another
command satan slunk away and the
squad of ant soldiers returned to the city
while doggo came and stood solicitously
at my side when i had rested sufficiently
i rose to my feet and together we returned
to my quarters

   it was time for my lesson but i was in
no mood for study so i gloomily pushed
the books and papers to one side and went
and stood by one of the windows gazing
aimlessly at the beautiful garden below

   it is always darkest before dawn as i
stood there at the window with my spirits
at a low ebb there came to my eyes a
vision which changed the entire course of
my life

  for crossing the courtyard below me
was what seemed to be a human being 
here at last was some one for me to talk
to

  but was it a human being after all
he or she or it stopped just in front
of my window and began daintily to pluck
a bouquet of flowers so that i had ample
opportunity to study the creature it wore
a blue and white toga similar to the one
which the ant man had furnished me and
now i saw the reason for the slits in the
back for through them protruded a pair
of tiny rudimentary butterfly wings of
iridescent pearly hue

   the complexion of this dainty creature
was a softer pink and white than ever
i had seen on any baby its hair was
closely cropped and curly and brilliantly
golden but the most attractive thing
about it was the graceful way in which
it swayed and pirouetted as if before a

mirror though there was no mirror there
unless in its own imagination this pirouet-
ting led me to suppose that the creature
whether human or not was probably femi-
nine

   is there any more beautiful sight in the
world or in any world for that matter
than a beautiful girl admiring herself and
preening herself and acting altogether na-
tural and girlish when she thinks that she
is alone and unobserved

  but was this a girl she was pretty
enough to be an angel or a fairy and the
little wings suggested something along
that line

   but then i began to notice certain other
things about her which puzzled me in the
first place she had an extra little finger on
each hand and six toes on each of her
bare little feet yet this fact did not in
the least detract from their dainty slimness
then too there projected from her fore-
head two tiny antenna such as one sees
on pictures of elves also she apparently
had no ears anyhow the lack of ears
was hardly noticeable though the absence
of the little pink tip just barely showing
below the edge of short hair did give
a slightly unfinished look to that part of
her head

   antenna and wings this must be either
a fairy or some new and beautiful kind
of creature

  she bore such a close resemblance to
a human being that my lonely spirit was
cheered by the thought that at last there
was a possibility of speech and human
companionship on this planet

   so intent had i been on drinking in this
vision of beauty below my window that
i had not noticed doggo approach me and
place himself at my side i was terribly
fearful lest the girl should go away with-
out my finding out who she was and how
i might see her again so forgetting my
manners and even the fact that she was
of an unknown race i plucked up sufficient
courage to address her

  my dear young lady began i but
i got no further for without noticing me
in the least she picked up her flowers and
the radio man



left the courtyard then i turned and
there was doggo standing beside me so he
too had seen the fairy

  seizing my pad and paper i wrote
what is that

  and he replied it is a cupian

  are there many cupians i wrote
  yes he answered

  am i a cupian i asked

  his answer was we do not know it
puzzles us

that afternoon i made more progress
with my studies than i had made in
weeks for now i was no longer fitting
myself merely for a bare existence in an
ant civilization but rather i was prepar-
ing for communication with-and i hoped
life among-creatures closely resembling
my own kind

  the beautiful cupian was evidently like
the ant menr devoid of hearing apparently
she lived here in the ant city and so un-
doubtedly understood the ant language

  but to make sure i asked doggo on my
pad do cupians read and write this
kind of writing

  and he answered yes

  at this i certainly did tackle my work
with a vim it was clear now that if i
wished to communicate with her i must
perfect myself in the written language of
the ants and so i set myself assiduously
to the task

  every day at about the same hour she
came and picked the blue and yellow flow-
ers and the red and purple twig knobs
of the garden below my window and
every day i sat in the window and watched
her and racked my brains for some tact-
ful way in which to attract her attention

  of course i raised the question with
doggo but he kept putting me off by say-
ing in substance it is not yet time
this i took to mean that i could not
yet write fluently enough to converse with
her and so i redoubled my efforts at my
studies

  so rapid was my progress nowunder
the spur of my desire for human compan-
ionship that within a very few days i was

able to graduate from my primers and
read real books

  one of the first real books which they
brought me was a history of their world
and this interested me greatly as it furn-
ished a setting for the experiences which
shortly were to crowd upon me the book
confirmed my theory that this world was
the silver planet venus

  finally i reached a point where my in-
terest was such that i could not wait to
wade further through the voluminous
pages so taking my pad and pencil i
asked doggo tell me briefly about the
more recent events on poros for so they
called the planet though of course i did
not yet know the sound of this word nor
even whether it had a sound tell me
more particularly about the great war

  well he replied also in writing of
course a little over five hundred years
ago the entire inhabited part of the planet
poros that is to say the continent which
is surrounded by the boiling sea was di-
vided up into twenty or more warring
kingdoms of cupians and one small queen-
dom of ant men namely formia

  the formians who were possessed of
all the virtues became more and more
vexed with the increasing degeneracy of
their neighbors until for purely altruistic
reasons the formians began a conquest to
extend their culture

  when the first convenient excuse of-
fered we declared war on one of the cupian
nations which we proceeded to attack
through the territory of a neutral state

  but wasnt this wrong i interjected

  he admitted i suppose that you are
right and that it really was in violation
of all treaties and of the solemn customs
of the planet but it was all in a noble
cause

  the other nations did not have sense
enough he continued to rally to com-
bat the common menace and so the for-
mians gradually conquered them one by
one until at last formia was mistress of
all poros

  there must have been some very able
statesmen in the imperial council at that


famous fantastic mysteries

time judging by the terms imposed by our
conquering nation we erected a fence
or pale across the middle of the entire
continent and all the cupians regardless
of their former boundaries were organized
into a single nation to the north of this
pale the nation was named cupia after
the creatures who composed it and kew
the first was made its king

  kew so i later gathered from the book
was a renegade cupian who had always
greatly admired the conquerors and had
even gone so far as to assist them in their
conquest

  the ant men doggo went on took
over all the territory to the south of the
pale and prospered greatly we were na-
turally a more industrious race than the
sport-loving cupians and now had in
addition the services of slaves for by the
terms of the treaty of mooni every male
cupian upon coming of age has to labor
for two years in formia

  there have followed nearly five hun-
dred years of peace a peace of force it
is true and yet a peace under which both
countries had enjoyed prosperity in recog-
nition of which fact the anniversary of the
signing of the treaty is annually cele-
brated throughout the continent

  the present reigning monarch of cupia
is kew the twelfth the first after a long
line of docile kings to give us any trouble
in the enforcement of the treaty but even
he keeps within the law

  the statutes of cupia are enacted by
a popular assembly while those of formia
are promulgated by an appointive coun-
cil of twelve but the laws of both coun-
tries must receive the approval of the
queen of formia

  such were the salient features of the
recent history of poros

every day i watched for the fair
cupian at the appointed hour i
learned to know her every feature and
every curve of her supple girlish body i
noted that her eyes were azure blue i
noticed the dainty way in which the tip
of her little pink tongue just touched each

edible red twig knob which she placed
between her lips and many another indi-
vidual mannerism

  a great many beautiful girls have i met
in the source of my brief existence boston
society need yield the palm to none on this
score yet i had gone to all the teas and
dinners and dances perfunctorily merely
because it was done and had always re-
garded women as an awful bore

  how few women are interested in radio
engineering for instance or even have a
sympathetic feeling for it

  but now all was changed and i didnt
in the least care whether or not this girl
was interested in radio engineering or
what she was interested in provided i
could eventually interest her in me for
i longed for human companionship

  of course on days when tropical thun-
derstorms swept the city as happened fre-
quently i did not expect her but on such
days i missed this my one contact with
humanity and felt vaguely uneasy

  yet i did not fully realize how much
even these daily visits of hers to my garden
had come to mean to me until one per-
fectly pleasant day when the cupian girl
failed to show up at the expected hour

  i waited and waited and fretted and
fretted but still she did not come doggo
was unable to offer any consolation and
my lessons went very badly

  the next day the committee of four
made one of their visits of inspection i
had now progressed far enough in my
mastery of their language so that doggo
was able to explain to me the reason for
the existence of this committee

   these four wrote he are the profes-
sors of biology anatomy agriculture and
eugenics from the university of mooni
the center of education of all poros im-
mediately upon your capture this com-
mittee was speedily dispatched by the uni-
versity authorities to make a thorough
study of you they were to determine
whether you are a cupian or some new and
strange kind of beast and whether your
particular breed could be put to any good
use
the radio man



  how interesting i wrote on my pad
and have they reached any conclusions
it is for them to question you he re-
plied come i will write down for you
to answer the things they wish to know
so then through the medium of doggos
pad they questioned me at length about
myself the earth how i had come to
poros and my progress since landing
but their procedure mystified me how did
doggo know what they wanted him to
say was he a mind reader

  when they had asked me all they cared
they gathered together in a corner ap-
parently holding an inaudible conference
on the results

  it was evident that there was something
of great moment in the air

  and so there was for presently they
withdrew and returned with the young girl
the girl whose presence on this planet had

inspired me to master at last the ant
language

  eagerly i sprang forward with my stylus
and paper anxious to start a conversation
with this fair creature and then i was
halted by the sight of her face

  to my dying day nothing can ever wipe
from my memory the deeply engraved pic-
ture of the look of absolute horror and
loathing which she gave me as she recoiled
from the contamination of my presence
then she swooned and was carried out by
the four professors

  oh how i longed for her the one human-
like creature that i had seen on poros anc
yet what an impassable gulf separated usj
the gulf between the understandings and
mentalities and means of communication
of two distinct worlds i was determined
nevertheless to see her again but how
ah that was the question

my jeanne had turned into a
little statuette of wondrous
beauty

 frivolous fingers play with sciences secrets in a perilous game of hide-

w

 ell jve engaged an assistant
 i announced to my wife one day
 at luncheon

 i am glad of that you have been work-
 ing much too hard who is he

 it isnt a -he  t replied as carelessly
 as i could its jeanne briand

 copyrighted  by the frank a mangry co
 

  but why jeanne briand what quali-
fications has she what does she know of
biochemistry she inquired too searching
i thought in that high-pitched staccato
voice of hers which latterly had grated
on me

shes taken her masters degree i
the diminishing draft

 

explained as best i could and besides
she had a course in biology under cal-
houn

  the wife of a university professor may
not be versed in the subject with which
his name is identified but she knows that
academic standards are high knows that
a vivacious copper-haired laughing-eyed
girl who has dabbled in a few text-books
and chased butterflies with a net is not
ordinarily given an important post in a
famous biochemical laboratory

  i think you might have taken young
mitchel or some other postgraduate in your
department

  that was all we said she suspected
something there was no question of it

  and so jeanne was duly installed in my
home laboratory i made it very plain to
her that she must keep regular hours also
that she must conduct herself as my as-
sistant and not as the woman whom i loved
and whom i hoped to wed

from the first i had my misgivings
it was jeanne who conceived the idea
of working in the laboratory with me-
not i she was as out of place among my
instruments and reagent bottles as a wood
nymph

  it is needless to dwell on the circum-
stances that swayed us needless to re-
count here how difficult it was to part
whenever we had passed an hour to-
gether needless to picture the dreamy
longing that hung over us both until our
hands and lips touched again that is a
characteristic of every week-old love

  please let me help you in your work
she pleaded over and over again i want
to be near you always let me do any-
thing-anything i can keep the instru-
ments clean i can write down your notes
it is unbearable to see you only like this
once in a long while let me work with
you in the laboratory

  but you forget i reasoned that the
laboratory where i do most of my work
is in my own house and i am married
some day we shall be together always
think of the risks that we would run we

cant have a scandal sooner or later we
would be discovered

  i had intended to make a clean breast
of the whole affair to my wife and free
myself from my marital ties in the con-
ventional way even though it meant the
end of my university career but jeanne
could not and would not wait a man of
stronger will than mine would have yielded
the desire to have her ever near me to
see the winsome smile on her face to
sense her presence in the same room
moved me more than her arguments in
short i yielded

  scientifically speaking she was all but
useless in the laboratory she had some
talent for drawing and so i employed her
in making diagrams for my treatise on
experimental evolution

  she radiated femininity she had an
elfish way of interrupting me in my work
at the most critical stage in dissecting
the head of an insect under the glass she
would come up and stroke my hair or kiss
the nape of my neck if i reproved her
she wept which meant much kissing away
of her tears and mollifying her with the
endearments that all lovers automatically
invent on the spur of the moment and
yet she honestly tried to help me sim-
ply because of her slavish devotion to me

  although she needed constant super-
vision her drawings were excellent in-
deed they soon justified her presence in
my laboratory in the eyes of the entire
university

  it was about a fortnight after she be-
came my nominal assistant that i assigned
to her the task of making a series of
sketches to demonstrate the effect of baro-
turpinol on parameba

  i may mention in passing that parameba
is a microscopic animal-a mere cell-
found in stagnant ponds and that in a
dilute solution of baroturpinol the whole
structure of the creature undergoes a re-
markable change it was i who discov-
ered the effect of baroturpinol on micro-
organisms of the parameba class im-
mersed in baroturpinol the few cells of
which parameba is composed dwindle and


famous fantastic mysteries

dwindle under the microscope until finally
the organism still keeping its own shape
disappears

  i had completely misinterpreted this
disappearance of microorganisms under the
action of baroturpinol i thought that they
merely disintegrated it was jeanne who
taught me otherwise

   one day while she was engaged in mak-
ing the drawings which would show the
progressive disappearance of parameba
jeanne exclaimed

  theyve come back again

   who has i questioned thinking that
she was talking of people whom we knew
besides i was engrossed in correcting the
proofs of a scientific paper

   why the parameba i cant understand
it

  a glance convinced me that she was
right in less than a minute i saw a speci-
men literally grow under my eyes into a
full-fledged parameba i can liken the
proceeding only to the coming of an ob-
ject toward one with all the attendant
increase in size that the movement im-
plies

perhaps i may make myself clearer
if i say that the restoration of para-
meba as i saw it then and many times
after was like a railway train traveling
toward one from the distance at first a
far speck is visible then the outline of a
locomotive engine can be distinguished
and at last a huge machine and thunder-
ing cars threaten to crush one out of ex-
istence

  but that was not all parameba came
back alive every biologist and chemist
supposed that baroturpinol was a deadly
poison at all events i had noticed that
when any microorganism was brought into
contact with even a trace of baroturpinol
all activity ceased death seemed neces-
sarily to precede the process of shrinking

i could hardly believe my eyes when i
saw my resuscitated parameba moving
about with that characteristic tumbling
motion by which it is so well known

  what have you been doing i asked

   just what you told me to do

   dear dear jeanne i said taking her
two hands in mine do you know that
you have made what may prove to be a
very important discovery in biology do
you know that you may have upset the
whole theory of life

   she clapped her hands but at the time
the wonderful scientific significance of
what she had seen was lost to her she
saw that i approved of her and she was
happy

   but what did this astonishing revival
of parameba mean over and over again i
watched for the return of specimens under
the microscope parameba would not re-
turn i questioned jeanne closely i even
watched her prepare a few slides herself
hoping that she had unconsciously de-
parted from the routine that i had pre-
scribed and had contaminated the baro-
turpinol in a way that would explain
everything

  at last she remembered she had
touched the slide with a little glass rod
in order to shift it on the stage of the
instrument the rod did not seem clean
she thought to improve matters by wip-
ing it a painstaking and conscientious
laboratory worker would have used a piece
of sterile cotton jeanne used her pocket
handkerchief it was clear enough that
that little piece of linen was strangely
linked with the accidental revivification of
parameba

   my deduction was confirmed when i
too experimented with the handkerchief

i deposited a single drop of stagnant water
on a clean glass slide under the powerful
lens i saw parameba tumbling about then
i added a drop of baroturpinol one gram
of barturpinol to a cubic centimeter of
distilled water is the proportion as every
one knows and at once all activity ceased
apparently killed the specimens of para-
meba began to shrink in that curious man-
ner upon which i had already dilated i
took a glass rod and wiped it on jeannes
handkerchief first making sure that para-
meba had quite disappeared i touched
the little drop of moisture on the slide
the diminishing draft

 

my guess was right it was jeannes hand-
kerchief parameba came rushing back to
life as startlingly as at first

  the handkerchief had been definitely
linked with the phenomenon but i was in
the dark as much as ever what mysterious
properties had this little piece of fabric
that it should thus divert the whole course
of modern biochemistry

  tell me jeanne i said did your
handkerchief touch anything here-some
solution

  no im sure

  but you must have done something
with it feel its a little damp

  i wiped my eyes with it she ad-
mitted reluctantly i had been crying
at something that you said

  i did not stop to inquire what it was
that i had said a light dawned on me
hr tears had so uncannily brought back
parameba to life and tears-what are
they when stripped of all sentiment but
salt water

  a spectroscopic analysis of jeannes
handkerchief convinced me that common
salt had the property of bringing back
parameba to life

  dozens of experiments showed that al-
most any solution of salt would answer
the stronger it was the more quickly did
life triumph over death

and now began an investigation which
was a strange mixture of scientific
research and love-making to jeanne it
was like a play she was very much bored
when i would repeat tests perhaps twenty-
five or fifty times simply to be sure of my
results but when we experimented with
a new organism she was all eagerness all
dancing eyes and clapping hands

  it was jeanne who made the discovery
in the first place and jeanne who de-
veloped its full possibilities she had no
well-considered plan of work she simply
allowed her impulses her girlish whims to
sway her

  i want things to happen she would
say as i tried to explain to her how time-
wasting was this unscientific haphazard

blind plunging into a new and unexplored
field and yet through her insatiable de-
sire for excitement her dramatic interest
we found out what really happened when
higher organisms were subjected to the
action of baroturpinol

  as for me i confined myself entirely
to simple-celled organisms all so small
that they cannot be seen with the naked
eye here i thought was enough work to
engage me for years but that was too
tame for jeanne she had the imagination
and the daring that seem to accompany
scientific ignorance

  i kept a little aquarium in one corner
of the laboratory-a spawning glass jungle
of fresh-water life it was a never-ending
source of entertainment for her i have
known her to sit for an hour at a time
watching crayfish crawl lazily along on
the bottom or a school of tiny goldfish
fighting for a crumb that she had mis-
chievously tossed in

  one day-it was about two months after
she came to me-she ran to me all radiant
holding a bowl at the bottom of which
were two or three tiny golden flakes they
were so small that i had to hold the bowl
against the window and view them by
transmitted light

  what have we here i asked won-
dering what new fancy had seized her

  goldfish she said

  nonsense i retorted

  yes they are she insisted i took
some japanese goldfish from the aquarium
and dropped them into baroturpinol and
they all shrank up like this

  if the original discovery of paramebas
disappearance and return had startled me
how shall i describe the stupefaction that
this announcement called forth i saw at
once what i had only guessed at before
parameba had shrunk beyond the limits
of visibility under the microscope which
accounted for its utter disappearance but
the goldfish being much larger had shrunk
until each became perhaps the size of a
dot on the letter i

  i gazed at the girl with increasing won-
der never would it have occurred to me


famous fantastic mysteries

to leap at once from simple microscopic
organisms to so high a form of life as a
fish on the other hand i must say that
it was my academic timidity if i may so
call it my systematic way of proceeding
stepwise from one experiment to another
that had led to the original misconception
of baroturpinols effect

  to every physician and every biologist
in the world baroturpinol was simply a
germicide true tilden who had dis-
covered it had noticed that it had a
curious puckering effect on living tissue
for which reason it had been condemned
as quite useless as a substitute for mercury
bichloride phenol and similar agents and
had been adopted simply as a convenient
and cheap hospital sterilizer and now
comes my jeanne my capricious dancing
playful jeanne a mere trifier in science
and at once uncovers the hidden pos-
sibilities of a completely misunderstood
compound not because she is a biologist
but because she simply wants to be
amused

  obviously it was my business to find
out whether like the microscopic organ-
isms that i had thus far examined the
baroturpinoled goldfish would be revivified
by a solution of common salt i decanted
the liquid in the bowl washed the
inanimate shimmering flakes in distilled
water and then filled the bowl with a
solution of salt

  the drama of paramebas return to
life was repeated on a more striking scale
very slowly the dead creatures began to
expand soon they assumed their normal
shapes-not i repeat that they had lost
them by shrinking but simply that the
curves of their bodies were developed it
was not until they had regained their full
size that life itself returned

  to me the thing was as startling as if
a man who had been poisoned by prussic
acid and who had been pronounced dead
were to open his eyes get up and walk

i took some pains to explain all this to
the intensely amused jeanne and i re-
peated the experiment with a particularly
large goldfish which i abstracted from the

aquarium i made no impression whatever
upon her she promptly christened the
fish lazarus when he came back to
life and adopted him as a pet

   this impulsiveness of hers this reckless
disregard of all system and plan could
this be a form of mental activity which
i had been wrong in regarding rather
lazily as showing only an average order
of intellect some one has defined in-
tuition as a swift deduction from present
facts if that be so-i am no psychologist
-then we must reckon with intuition as
well as with the slower and more de-
liberate methods of reasoning in scientific
research

  if jeanne was anything she was in-
tuitive i felt that i must credit her with
powers that were denied me after all it
was she and not i who had stumbled
upon the amazing action of baroturpinol i
had done little beyond repeating her fanci-
ful experiments under rigorous scientific
control she showed me the stars as it
were i merely counted them

the possession of a common secret
strengthened the tie between jeanne
and myself it was as if we had found
some beautiful priceless gem which we
had decided to keep for ourselves and
never to show to the world we lost all
self-control in the beginning we had
maintained a semblance of formality she
kept regular laboratory hours coming in
the morning at nine and leaving at about
five in the afternoon it was always pro-
fessor hollister and miss briand when
we spoke to each other before others

  but in truth the hours that we spent
together in the laboratory each day
heightened our love for each other made
us more and more indispensable to each
other it became so difficult for us to leave
each other out of our sight that we even
went into the woods together for specimens
to be experimented with in the laboratory
these specimens she could easily have
gathered for me quite alone the univer-
sity students and the villagers began to
talk about us
the diminishing draft



  it was my wife of course who im-
parted that information to me

  you are making yourself ridiculous
she announced

  indeed how

  every one is talking about you

  i pretended not to understand an at-
tempt of mine to divert her attention from
a topic which it made me uneasy to dis-
cuss failed ignominiously

  even the postmaster in the village com-
ments on your conduct with jeanne
briand every one stopped talking when
i came to the regular sewing-circle
yesterday and looked at me in a pitying
sort of way if you have no consideration
for yourself at least consider me

  i got up and stalked out of the room
i was neither polite nor brave

  the time had come for action i could
not go on in this way a scandal was in-
evitable and the best that i could now
do was to mitigate it in some way jeanne
and i must separate until such time as
i could free myself with the aid of the
divorce courts i must tell her

  she read in my face that something was
wrong when i stepped into the laboratory
late that afternoon

  you are in trouble dear she said
what is it tell me

  and then i told her of the conversation
with my wife of the utter impossibility
of concealing our true relations much
longer

  we must separate jeanne if its only
for a little while-until i am free and
then we shall come back to each other
again and we will work together in the
laboratory not as professor and assistant
but as man and wife

  she burst into tears never before had
i seen a human being in such distress she
was convulsed with anguish so that her
whole body shook i took her in my arms
and did my best to soothe her

  it will only be for a little while i
repeated over and over again it was all
that i could think of all that i coulday

  the sun had long since set and the
laboratory was soon quite dark we sat

together on the couch in the corner in
close embrace jeannes head on my shoul-
der

  you must rest i said and laid her on
the couch and sat beside her

  she half-murmured half-moaned some-
thing and let me do with her as i would

  how long she lay there i did not realize
at the time hour after hour slipped by
at last it struck me that we could not
stay thus all night-that i must take
jeanne home

  ome i admonished her we must
go now it is very late

  i helped her to her feet pressed a but-
ton and turned on the electric light she
was as limp as a drooping flower all numb
and listless i walked to the closet and
took her hat from its peg

  as i did so i heard footsteps in the
corridor leading to the laboratory who
could this be

  completely unnerved as i was dis-
tracted by jeannes despair i was in-
capable of thinking clearly it was one
in the morning by the laboratory clock
jeanne never stayed in the laboratory
later than six no one must find her here
now

  in my ordinary senses the fall of a
footstep in the corridor would not have
disturbed me now i acted automatically
and with cowardly absurdity i ran to
the door and locked it instead of flinging
it open wide

  there came a knock

  if some one had leveled a pistol at me
and threatened to shoot me i could not
have been more alarmed jeanne too
was frightened we looked at each other
questioningly two helpless lovers

  let me in shrilled a voice outside
it was my wifes from what she had
told me earlier in the day i inferred that
she must have been watching jeanne like
a cat and that she carefully noted when
the girl came and went where to find
her now she knew only too well

  concealment was useless

  what do you want i asked

  a flood of impassioned accusations fol-


famous fantastic mysteries

lowed in which jeanne was referred to
as that woman with much incoherent
repetition of the phrase wrecked home
the situation was damning

months ago i had decided that the
divorce proceedings should be free
from the usual scandal but what a ghast-
ly story this would make in the news-
papers i could read the suggestive head-
lines and the salaciously worded account
of the manner in which my wife had
trapped me-a university professor the
sensational newspapers in particular would
rejoice in the opportunity of pilloring the
supposedly academic scientist and of ex-
posing him as if he were a libertine in cap
and gown

  it was jeanne who saved us i stood
like one paralyzed not knowing what to
do it was the rustle of her skirt that
brought me to my senses i turned around
just in time to see her raise a beaker of
baroturpinol to her lips and pour it down

  i know that i cried out for there was
a sudden cessation of the clamor outside
the door i rushed to jeannes side good
heavens what would the effect be

  never had we experimented with baro-
turpinol on anything higher than a fish
she lost consciousness in my arms i
thought she was dead she was pallid and
stiff as if rigor mortis had set in then
came over her that change which i had
observed under the microscope and in the
test tube her form dwindled and dwindled
in my arms as if it were slipping from
me until at last i held nothing but her
limp clothes

  it was as if both her soul and her body
had drifted away from the room as if
she had slipped out of her earthly fabric
like a butterfly from its chrysalis i
dropped the bundle on the floor and began
to grope within it somewhere within these
folds i knew must be the shrunken body
of my jeanne

  at last i found it-a little white form
i slipped it into my pocket the clothes
and hat i stuffed into a chest

  my courage had returned now i stepped

to the door unlocked it and flung it wide
open my wife entered and with her a
maid-whom she evidently brought as a
witness her lips were tightly drawn her
eyes were mere slits if ever there was an
infuriated woman bent on vengeance it
was she

  she looked about her under other cir-
cumstances her astonishment would have
been comical all this furtive watching
all these clamorous accusations-all for
nothing she darted to the closet in which
jeanne would hang her hat and coat and
i my laboratory aprons convinced that
jeanne was hidden there she threw back
the door with such violence that the knob
indented the plaster wall

  where is she what have you done
with her she screamed

  you see that you are mistaken there
is no one here

  she saw that further inquiry would be
useless outwitted but not deceived she
swept angrily out of the room i locked
the door after her

  i sat down at the laboratory table took
out of my pocket the thing that had once
been my jeanne and placed it before me
my eyes were blurred with tears so this
was all that was left to me of jeanne this
was the price of my weakness and my
cowardice she was dead now and i felt
as if i had been an accomplice in her
suicide

  there comes an interval in every grief
an interval of calm during which all mun-
dane affairs seem trivial and even ones
own misery becomes petty it is as if one
had passed out of a long dark narrow
passageway into a vast open twilight
beyond in one of those intervals of calm
i regained sufficient control of myself
to examine the white remnant of jeanne

  the thing that to my fevered touch had
felt like a mere shapeless mass when i
hastily thrust it into my pocket revealed
itself as a little statuette of wondrous
beauty it seemed carved out of ivory this
exquisite miniature frozen jeanne what
would not cellini have given if he could
have shaped a figure so beautiful
the diminishing draft



  everything was white except the hair
her eyebrows and the lashes of her closed
eyes the lips were delicately tinted like
a budding rose but they had not the rich
color of pulsating life as for her hair it
still lay in tiny coils about her hair a mass
of twisted coppery brown jeanne must
have been in the act of falling when i
caught her in my arms one foot of the
little figure was raised and it seemed as
if she were about to sink down on one
knee

  a sculptor would have marveled at the
mere material of which this rare work of
art had been fashioned it seemed like
wax yet it had nothing of the oiliness of
wax to the touch could it be ivory it
was too exquisitely white

  and then the wonderful perfection of
its detail i was afraid to touch the lashes
of the eyes lest i should break them and
the little ears how finely they were
modeled the little hands and feet how
scrupulously every curve and line and
hollow had been preserved and the dear
body of her how plastic for all its lifeless
rigidity

  for the first time in my life i under-
stood the ecstatic ravings of artists when
they endeavored to reveal to others the
beauty that is so evident to them reauty
such as this left one inarticulate

  the face perplexed me-or rather its
expression jeanne was all gaiety and ani-
mation but this reduction of herself sug-
gested nothing of that how could it
jeanne was motion personified flitting
hither and thither like a butterfly these
placid features with no trace of the smile
that lit up the dearest face in the world
were still and cold

  the aspect of this precious pallid
beauty all that was left to me of jeanne
overcame me t know that t sobbed and
i am not ashamed to own it i vowed to
myself that i would preserve this remnant
of her this visible evidence of her self-
sacrifice as a thing to be worshiped i
would enshrine it in some secret fitting
way it would be my holy of holies

  dawn was breaking i washed my hot

fevered face and held a water soaked towel
to my swollen eyes for a few minutes
fresh air and a long walk would do me
good i thought i wrapped the white
figure tenderly in cotton dropped it into
my pocket and then walked out into the
open

  i must have wandered about in a stupor
for the life of me i cannot now tell where
i went or how i returned i know that the
sun was well up in the heavens when i
found myself in and went to my room in
the afternoon i had to give a lecture on
mendels laws to the senior class in biol-
ogy i flung myself down on the bed
dressed as i was hoping that i might
snatch an hours sleep so that i might not
appear too manifestly beside myself with
grief

i must have dozed for i was awakened
by a knock at the door it was the
maid i was wanted at the telephone

  say that i cant be disturbed i di-
rected her

  she says its very important was the
reply

  who does

  miss briands landlady

  my state of mind can be imagined when
i say that i could not divine why jeannes
landlady wished to speak to me on the
telephone i found out quickly enough
when i answered

  did i know where miss briand was
asked the voice over the telephone she
had not been at home all night and it
was now past noon was she at the labora-
tory yesterday when did she leave
should her disappearance be reported to
the police

  i could tell from her voice that the
woman was concerned more about herself
than about jeanne she ran a respectable
house she insisted again and again she
did hope nothing had happened which
would compromise her or her establish-
ment i reassured her as best i could and
promised her that i would look into the
matter of jeannes disappearance and com-
municate with her again


famous fantastic mysteries

  her reference to the police startled me
it brought me to my senses it had not
occurred to me before that a human being
cannot step out of existence as it were
unchallenged suppose the police were to
descend on the laboratory and investigate

  what could i say no one would believe
me of course if i told the truth about
the experiments with parameba and how
they had led step by step to jeannes un-
doing even if i summoned the best ex-
perts even if they confirmed my dis-
coveries what biologist would be bold
enough to administer baroturpinol to a
human being and prove that even the
highest forms of life yielded to the strange
influence of that mysterious compound
and what human being short of a mad-
man could be found who would willingly
sacrifice himself good heavens

  and then there were jeannes clothes
they would surely be found in the chest

  i sank into a chair my whole body
was bathed in a perspiration of fright
suppose that i were accused of murder
a divorce scandal was bad enough but
a murder a murder-

  lecturing was out of the question i
telephoned to the university that illness
would prevent me from attending and that
the class was to be dismissed i had to
think this out t must gain time my case
was clearly desperate

  all at once a ray of hope flashed upon
me why not try salt if parameba a
sea-urchin a goldfish-and a fish is after
all not so very low in the scale of evo-
lution-can be restored to their natural
proportions and to life why not a human
being yes perhaps the salt solution
would save me and bring back my jeanne
to me

  but what reason had i to suppose that
because a few animals could be reduced
and expanded at will i might bring jeanne
back to life suppose that the little statu-
ette should return to life but to remain
a mere miniature of jeanne that was
too horrible

  worse still suppose that the figure
should reassume the girls natural shape

but that no spark of life would reanimate
the body what then i should be worse
off tljan ever the white remnant of her
that i carried with me could be hidden
the clothes in the chest too could be
disposed of no one could prove that
jeanne was really dead

  but a lifeless body-

  i fled into the laboratory if ever a man
was on the verge of madness it was i
tormented by grief at the loss of jeanne
and stricken with terror at the prospect
of arrest i felt like a wild beast at bay

  i longed for some simple-minded prac-
tical unscientific friend to whom i could
turn for counsel in my need i knew the
difference between a holothurian and a
jellyfish but in the cloistered university
i had lost track of human hearts and
problems however my problem was my
problem i alone could solve it

  it came to me very clearly at last that
i owed it to jeanne to make some effort
at resuscitating all that was left of her
the resolution was more easily made than
carried out where should i conduct this
momentous experiment

  the laboratory naturally suggested it-
self first i dismissed the thought almect
at once there was no vessel large enough
to hold a human body and suspicion might
be aroused if i had one brought in i might
go to a hotel and engage a room and bath
the bathtub would surely serve the pur-
pose

  but suppose that the little figure of
jeanne should swell and magnify and
suppose that life should not return i
would have to explain the presence of a
corpse in my room-the corpse of a woman
who had played a part in my life and for
whom the police were searching that
would help neither jeanne nor me better
a thousand times that she should remain
in my pocket than that

  finally i came to the conclusion that i
must go to some lonely place by the sea
had we not discovered early in our in-
vestigations that any solution of salt even
seawater performed the miracle of bring-
ing back to life organisms which had been
the diminishing draft



diminished by baroturpinol besides
would it not be easy to dispose of the
corpse if life did not return

  i looked at my watch it was just half
past three glaston-by-the-sea was three
hours distant by the railway if i left
this afternoon by night all my doubts and
fears would be dispelled

  i had not slept in twenty-four hours
some rest i must have my nerves were
so unstrung that i could feel my eyelids
quivering i could hardly touch a book or
an implement without dropping it

  so i went into my room and bathed
and threw myself down on the bed to
catch what little sleep i could

glaston-by-the-sea is a fishing
village comprising nothing more than
a dozen houses in- front of it lies the
ocean in back tower cliffs of limestone
the sand stretches oh either side of the
village for miles and miles walk ten min-
utes away from the village and you might
as well be in the desert of sahara for any
signs of human life that you can see

  i knew the coast well many a specimen
had i collected among the rocks as the
tide went out

  it was dark when i alighted from the
train four miles from glaston the full
moon was rising in the east-a great
round yellow topaz that crept higher and
higher in the sky i had not counted on a
bright night

  to carry out a hazardous experiment in
the aspect of that cold luminous disk
seemed too public it was so like a round
inscrutable face that looked down at me in
benignant curiosity then it occurred to
me how strangely fascinated jeanne had
always been by the full moon how she
had longed for the time when we might
watch it rise together in some such lonely
place as this shut off from the strife and
the clamor and the prying eyes of the
world i am not superstitious but it did
seem as if that great ball in the sky might
be a good omen

  at about ten oclock i reached the shore
two miles above glaston for i had care-

fully avoided the village it was flood tide
the sea was dappled with opalescent
ripples now and then a swelling wave
would roll up on the sands and the water
would tumble reluctantly back again in a
vast expanse of foam only the rhythmic
wash of a smooth sea broke the silence of
that moonlit solitude

  jeannes clothes and hat i had brought
with me in a traveling-bag i took them
out and spread them on the beach just as
i imagined she would have arranged them
herself in her chamber

  now that i thought of it this idea of
coming to glaston and making an heroic
attempt to bring jeanne back to life
seemed like a stroke of genius what if
the experiment did fail what if the re-
duced image of herself did resume its
normal shape but without coming back to
life i could leave the corpse on the sands
it would seem as if she had died in some
inexplicable way

  here were her clothes all neatly ar-
ranged testifying mutely in my behalf
there was no sign of violence

  one by one i took off my own clothes
and laid them down beside jeannes very
very carefully i unwrapped the parcel in
which t had carried her about i feared
that i might break off a strand of hair
or nick a foot or hand

  holding the figure in my outstretched
hands as if it were a sacred image i
walked into the sea straight toward the
moon my face uplifted this was more
than a scientific experiment human life
human happiness human love were at
stake

  now that i look back at the events of
that unforgettable night the whole pro-
ceeding must have seemed more like a
religious ceremony than a frantic mans
desperate effort to save the thing that he
held most precious surely no worshiper
who had ever entered an ancient egyptian
temple was more reverentially hopeful
than i nor more innocently expectant of
a miracle that would sweep away all earth-
ly doubts and reveal the hand of destiny
itself pointing toward the light


famous fantastic mysteries

  slowly the water rose to my knees to
my waist and at last to my breast it
lapped the frail figure in my hand i
clutched the thing lest it should slip from
my grasp how long i stood thus shoul-
der-high in the waves i do not know per-
haps it was only five minutes perhaps as
long as a quarter of an hour

  i know that i was stricken with terror
for a time for the figure in my hands
might have been made of stone for any
change that i could feel

  was i to fail was jeanne hopelessly
irretrievably dead

  then a moment came when the figure
seemed to slip in my hands i grasped it
tighter lest i should lose it still it slipped
-slipped as a fish slips in the hands now
i realized what was happening jeanne was
growing literally growing in my crooked
fingers i almost swooned

  even if the swelling miniature were not
the most precious thing in the world to me
even if it did not mean happiness and life
itself i would have found it difficult to
retain my self-control very very slowly
the figure grew to the size of a child i
had to hold it in my arms now it was not
only larger but perceptibly heavier

  a doubt assailed me would it stop
growing i prayed that it might keep on

  presently it grew so large that i could
no longer hold it in my arms alone i
walked back a few steps and lowered the
figure so that its feet touched the bottom
but i saw to it that it was completely
immersed fearful lest some monstrous ef-
fect might be produced if even a shoulder
were dry and could not grow with the rest

  in half an hour i should judge what
had been apparently an exquisite statuette
something that i could carry in my pocket
had become the full-sized form of my
jeanne but it was still hard there was
no feeling of yielding flesh-nothing but
the rigidity of so much clay

  for that i had been prepared by the
observation that i had made in my labora-
tory life returned to a shrunken organism
slowly almost hesitantly

  at last i felt jeanne soften in my arms

she was a thing of flesh now her form
had become supple and flexible i could
feel-rt as so much tissue

  and then the miracle of miracles hap-
pened her bosom heaved she sighed
her eyes opened she moaned and stared
at me utterly bewildered her mind could
not orient itself at first in a dim way
she seemed to realize who i was

  i could feel her arms tighten about my
neck and so i carried her to the beach
in the most ecstatic and exalted state in
which i have ever been

told my wife everything-every-
thing of the initial experiments with
parameba and the goldfish everything ex-
cept jeannes bold swallowing of the baro-
turpinol in a critical situation and of her
subsequent miraculous reanimation jeanne
meant all to me and my wife had ceased
to be if i may say so what she never
was i wanted a divorce and i said so
frankly

  so this is to be the end she sobbed
bitterly

  i see no other way to remain as we
are and to pretend that all is as it should
be between us would mean misery for
both of us it is better that we should
part

  but what if i should refuse is it
right that you should begin a new and
happy life and that i after all these
years should drift about aimlessly and
wretchedly this home is mine as much
as yours i made it what it is and shall
i give up everything for a woman whom
i hate

  there was much more in the same vein
i had not counted on this it was partly
bitter hatred of jeanne that swayed her
and partly wounded pride

  it had never occurred to me before
that marriage means more to a woman
than the building of a nest and the gratifi-
cation of the mating instinct in her
scheme of existence the conventions or
vanities of married life are enormously
important her conjugal rights the so-
cial status brought about by the mere act
the diminishing draft



of marriage are to her what his patent of
nobility is to a duke-something not to be
relinquished without a struggle

  my wife refused point-blank to divorce
me

  but that is senseless i argued if i
stay here our life will be a mere trav-
esty if i leave you and go my own way
you will not be unhappier what do you
gain by refusing

  you cant marry a woman who has
ruined my life and whom i hate by
refusing to divorce you i destroy her no
decent man or woman will befriend her
knowing what she is to you

  with that she flounced out of the room
this turn of events i had not foreseen
i knew that divorce meant the end of my
university career and for that i was fully
prepared but to have the finger of scorn
pointed at the woman i loved-

  i am a social being companionship
means much to me and it meant as much
to jeanne for a few months we might
be sufficient to ourselves then would
come a time when i would wish to spend
an evening with congenial friends and
jeanne with women who give teas and form
organizations for the uplift of the poor and
unenlightened

  what then i could hardly venture to
cross the thresholds of those temples of
purity and virtue whither i would even-
tually be drawn and on my arm a woman
whose relations to me were regarded as
scandalous

  and she-she would undoubtedly be re-
buffed if she sought to enter the circle
within which she now moved so freely

  you see that a scientist can be far more
practical in his reasoning than the world
supposes after all his whole training
teaches him how to deal with facts

  i was to meet jeanne that evening in
a dense grove near a little farmhouse
about half a mile from the end of the
trolley-line ever since her astonishing
restoration we had arranged to see each
other there three times a week her re-
turn to the laboratory was out of the
question for the time being

  there she was at the appointed time
and place looking very demure in a neat
white dress which she had made herself
she saw that i was troubled and i told
her at once the outcome of the afternoons
parley

  either she would not or she could not
see the situation in its true light was i
not everything in her life she was more
than willing to forego ordinary social in-
tercourse if she could only work and
live with me a thousand reasons she
advanced to prove how unnecessary the
outer world must be to us

  she was a born romanticist living per-
petually in a fairy castle on a mountain-
top capped with silvery clouds in that
atmosphere there is no time jeanne lived
only in the present i could hope for no
practical assistance from her i must rea-
son this problem out for myself

  so i changed the topic at the first
opportunity and we passed the rest of the
evening in the usual lighthearted way

  during these meetings we talked chiefly
of the romantic possibilities of barotur-
pinol

  how simple and cheap it would be for
us to travel she would ramble on you
could carry me in your pocket just as you
did to glaston or i could pack you away
in my handbag and take you with me
if i had a friend i might even have
myself sent to you by parcel-post salt
water you can get everywhere

  of course i smiled at this but im not
so sure that jeanne was not serious

  that was the last i ever saw of her

two days later i was to keep my tryst
with jeanne for the third time that
week i was in the grove at the appointed
hour she did not come -was she detained
or was she ill i fretted and fumed
hoping that each figure that loomed up
in the darkness for the grove was near
the road might be jeanne at eleven
oclock i gave up all hope of seeing her
that night

  my wife met me as i opened the door
of my house


famous fantastic mysteries

  may i speak to you a moment she
 asked

  t hung up my hat and followed her
 into her own room she took from her
 safe a little box and laid it on her dress-
 ing-table next she raised a window which
 opened on a paved court below it was
 clear she was following a well-thought-out
 plan of action

  i believe you wish to say something
 to me i said to relieve my suspense
 yes nothing more

  she untied the box concealed it from
 me as she did so presently she t lrned
 around holding in her hand an envelope

   read this she said it came yester-
 day

  the envelope had been steamed open
 it was addressed to me in jeannes hand-
 writing

   and so you open and read my letters
 i queried angrily

  when i suspect that they concern me
 i do she retorted coolly

   i reproduce it here that letter and a
 lock of hair that she once gave me are
 all that i have of jeanne

 dearest dick

   i	have been thinking so much of that
 wonderful night on the beach at glaston-
 the night when i was born again on the
 bosom of the sea just as if i were another
 aphrodite how beautiful it was to awaken
 and find myself looking at you by the light
 of the moon i i want to live all that over
 again to come back from oblivion and find
 myself clinging to you

   if i were to ask you i knotf that you
 would never consent to my becoming a dead
 image of myself again you would suspect
 my motive if i were to ask you for some
 baroturpinol so i have bought what i need

 if you will come to meet me in the grove
 beyond the farm at the usual time on fri-
 day you will find only a little white jeanne
 in the midst of her clothes

   put her in your pocket and take her with
 you to glaston next monday the moon
 will then be full

                                jeanne

 was i frightened i can hardly say
 it was as if some one had struck
 me a blow i was stunned

 intuitively i sensed the diabolical thing

 that my wife had done i had told her
 enough of my first experiments the rest
 jeaoues letter made sufficiently plain

  when i read this she explained all
the while standing i understood every-
thing i know now what happened in the
laboratory that afternoon when i knocked
at the door

  now listen carefully to what i say
i have told you that i hate this woman
that i will not permit her to take from me
what is rightfully mine late this after-
noon i went to the place that she men-
tions in her letter i did not know just
when she was to meet you and i didnt
care it was merely a matter of waiting
i hid myself behind some bushes and
watched

  a little while after sunset i saw her
down the road she came into the grove
and sat down on the grass then she took
off her hat and laid it beside her she sat
very quietly looking down the road
through the trees at first i thought that
she was afraid and that she would not
take the solution at all then i realized
why she did nothing she was waiting for
you

  she was clever she was not going to
run the risk of leaving a heap of clothes
in a grove an hour before you came with
the chance of arousing the curiosity of
some boy who might wander into the
grove she would wait until she saw you
far away you would reach her just at
the right moment so it proved i could
see you myself fully a quarter of a mile
away it was still quite light she never
took her eyes off the road i think she
must have seen you before i did she
opened her handbag and took out a bottle
before i caught my first glimpse of you

  the next i knew she had placed the
bottle to her lips and drained it off i
turned away i didnt want to see her
shrivel up before my very eyes a quarter
of a minute i thought would be about
long enough for her to shrink so i counted
fifteen and turned around where she had
sat was only a heap of clothes

  there was not a second to lose now
you were almost at the grove t crawled
the diminishing draft



out of the bushes and gathered up every-
thing dothes hat and all then i ran
away from the place just as you were about
to enter

  all the while she had been handling the
box i knew what it contained and my
brain was feverishly busy devising and
rejecting over and over again plans to get
it away from her by stealth if possible
by force if necessary i should have leaped
from my seat at once and seized her but i
sat still dazed as if in a kind of hypnotic
trance

  and here is your jeanne she almost
screamed as she took out a white sitting
figure you will never never have her

again i take her so and this-this is what
i do to her

  this time i did act i leaped to my feet
knocked over the table that she had so
ingeniously placed to obstruct me and
rushed at her

  but i was too late

  she was at the open window

  she raised her hand high above her
head posed there for a fraction of a sec-
ond the very incarnation of hate and
vengeance then she dashed the white
thing upon the stone pavement of the
court below

  i heard it break into a hundred pieces
as it struck

the sky cube

the doctor who was easily the most
musical of the four men sang in a
cheerful baritone

the owl and the pussy-cat went to sea

   in a beautiful pea-green boat

  the geologist who had held down the
lower end of a quartet in his university
days growled an accompaniment under
his breath as he blithely peeled the pota-
toes occasionally a high-pitched note or
two came from the direction of the engi-
neer he could not spare much wind while
clambering about the machinery oil-can
in hand the architect alone ignored the
famous tune

  what i cant understand smith he
insisted is how you draw the electricity
from the ether into this car without blast-
ing us all to cinders

  the engineer squinted through an opal
glass shutter into one of the tunnels
through which the anti-gravitation current
was pouring if you dont know any more
about buildings than you do about ma-
chinery jackson he grunted because
of his squatting position id hate to live
in one of your houses

  the architect smiled grimly youre
living in one of em right now smith
said he that is if you call this car a
house

  smith straightened up he was an un-
important-looking man of medium height

copyrighted  by

and build and bearing a mild good-
humored expression nobody would ever
look at him twice would ever guess that
his skull concealed an unusually complete
knowledge ot electricity and mechanisms

  i told you yesterday jackson he
said that the air surrounding the earth
is chock full of electricity and-

  and that the higher we go the more
juice added the other remembering as
much as to say that it is the atmosphere
then that protects the earth from the sur-
rounding voltage

  the engineer nodded occasionally it
breaks through anyhow in the form of
lightning now in order to control that
current and prevent it from turning this
machine and us into ashes all we do is
to pass the juice through a cylinder of
highly compressed air fixed in this wall
by varying the pressure and dampness
within the cylinder we can regulate the
flow

  the builder nodded rapidly all right
but why doesnt the electricity affect the
walls themselves i thought they were
made of steel

  the engineer glanced through the dead-
light at the reddish disk of the earth
hazy and indistinct at a distance of forty
million miles it isnt steel its a non-
magnetic alloy besides theres a layer of
crystalline sulphur between the alloy and
the vacuum space

  the vacuum is what keeps out the
cold isnt it jackson knew but he asked
in order to learn more

  the frank a munsey co
  
look out cried jackson as the sides of the glass case fell away and the gigantic monster sat
glaring furiously as if about to rise and spring

  keeps out the suns heat too the
outer shell is pretty blamed hot on that
side just as hot as it is cold on the shady
side smith seated himself beside a huge
electrical machine a rotary converter
which he next indicated with a jerk of his
thumb but you dont want to forget
that the juice outside is no use to us the
way it is we have to change it

  its neither positive nor negative its
just neutral so we separate it into two
parts and all we have to do when we

  want to get away from the earth or any
other magnetic sphere is to aim a bunch
of positive current at the corresponding
pole of the planet or negative current at
the other pole like poles repel

  listen easy commented jackson
too easy

  well it isnt exactly as simple as all
that takes a lot of apparatus all told
and the engineer looked about the room
his glance resting fondly on his beloved
machinery

   the big room fifty feet square was al-
 most filled with machines some reached
 nearly to the ceiling the same distance
 above in fact the interior of the cube
 had very little waste space the living
 quarters of the four men who occupied it
 had to be fitted in wherever there hap-
 pened to be room the architects own
 berth was sandwiched in between two
 huge dynamos

   he was thinking hard  see now why
you have such a lot of adjustments for
those tunnels meaning the six square
tubes which opened into the ether through
the six walls of the room youve got to
point the juice pretty accurately

   i should say so smith led the way
to a window and the two shaded their
eyes from the lights within while they
gazed at the ashy glow of mercury toward
which they were traveling ive got to
adjust the current so as to point exactly
toward his northern half smith might
have added that a continual stream of
repelling current was still directed toward
the earth and another toward the sun
away over to their right both to prevent
being drawn off their course

   and how fast are we going

   four or five times as fast as mother
earth between eighty and ninety miles
per second it s easy to get up speed out
here of course where theres no air re-
sistance

   another voice broke in the geologist
had finished his potatoes and a savory
smell was already issuing from the frying
pan years spent in the wilderness had
made the geologist a good cook and dou-
bly welcome as a member of the expedi-
tion

  we ought to get there tomorrow
then he said eagerly indoor life did not
appeal to him even under such exciting
circumstances he peered at mercury
through his binoculars beginning to
show up fine now

the builder improved upon van era-
mons example by setting up the cars
biggest telescope one of unusual excel-

lence all three pronounced the planet
which was three-fourths full as they
viewed it as having pretty much the ap-
pearance of the moon

   wonder why theres always been so
much mystery about mercury pondered
the architect invitingly

   mercury is so close to the sun an-
 swered the scientist that hes always
 been hard to observe for a long time the
 astronomers couldnt even agree that he
 always keeps the same face toward the
 sun like the moon toward the earth
 then his day is as long as his year
 eighty-eight of our days yes
 continual sunlight he cant be in-
 habited then the architect knew very
 little about the planets but he possessed
 remarkable ability as an amateur anti-
 quarian

   dr kinney shook his head not at
present certainly

 instantly jackson was alert then per-
 haps there were people there at one time
 why not the doctor put it lightly

 theres little or no atmosphere there
now of course but thats not saying there
never has been even if he is such a little
planet-less than three thousand smaller
than the moon-he must have had plenty
of air and water at one time the same as
the earth

   whats become of the air van em-
mon wanted to know kinney eyed him in
reproach he said

   you ought to know mercury has only
two-fifths as much gravitation as the
earth a man weighing a hundred and
fifty back home would be only a sixty-
pounder there and you cant expect stuff
as light as air to stay forever on a planet
with no more pull than that when the
sun is on the job only thirty-six million
miles away

   about a third as far as from the earth
 to the sun commented the engineer
 by george it must be hot

   on the sunlit side yes said kinney
 on the dark side it is as cold as space
 itself-four hundred and sixty below fah-
 renheit
the lord of death

 

  they considered this in silence for some
minutes after a while the builder came
back with another question

  if mercury ever was inhabited then
his day wasnt as long as it is now was
it

  no said the doctor in all proba-
bility he once had a day the same length
as ours mercury is a comparatively old
planet you know being smaller he
cooled off earlier than the earth and has
been more affected by the pull of the sun
but its been a mighty long time since he
had a day like ours before the earth was
cool enough to live on probably

  but since mercury was made out of
the same batch of material- prompted
the geologist

  no reason then why life shouldnt
have existed there in the past exclaimed
the architect his eyes sparkling with the
instinct of the born antiquarian he
glanced up eagerly as the doctor coughed
apologetically and said

  dont forget that even if mercury is
part baked and part frozen there must be
a region in between which is neither he
picked up a small globe from the table
and ran a finger  completely around it
from pole to pole so there must be a
narrow band of country where the sun
is only partly above the horizon and
where the climate is temperate

  then-the architect almost shouted
in his excitement an excitement only
slightly greater than that of the other two
-then if there were people on mercury
at one time-

  the doctor nodded gravely there
may be some there now

chapter ii

a dead city

from a height of a few thousand
miles mercury instead of the craters
which always distinguished the moon
showed ranges of bona fide mountains

  the sky-car was rapidly sinking nearer
and nearer the planet already smithtiad
stopped the current with which he had at-

tracted the cube toward the little worlds
northern hemisphere and was now using
negative voltage this in order to act as
a brake and prevent them from falling to
destruction

  suddenly van emmon the geologist
whose eyes had been glued to his binocu-
lars gave an exclamation of wonder
look at those faults he pointed to-
ward a region south of that for which
they were bound what might be called
the planets torrid zone

  at first it was hard to see then little
by little there unfolded before their eyes
a giant spiderlike system of chasms in the
strange surface beneath them from a
point almost directly opposite the sun
these cracks radiated in a half-dozen dif-
ferent directions vast irregular clefts
they ran through mountain and plain
alike in places they must have been
hundreds of miles wide while there was
no guessing as to their width for all that
the four in the cube could see they were
bottomless

  small likelihood of anybody being
alive there now commented the geologist
skeptically if the sun has dried it out
enough to produce faults like that how
could animal life exist

  notice however prompted the doctor
that the cracks do not extend all the
way to the edge of the disk this was
true all the great chasms ended far
short of the twilight band which the
doctor had declared might still contain
life

  but as the sky-car rushed downward
their attention became fixed upon the sur-
face directly beneath them a point whose
latitude corresponded roughly with that
of new york on the earth it was a re-
gion of low-lying mountains decidedly
different from various precipitous ranges
to be seen to the north and east on the
west or left-hand side of this district a
comparatively level stretch with an occa-
sional peak or two projecting suggested
the ancient bed of an ocean

  by this time they were within a thou-
sand miles smith threw on a little more

current their speed diminished to a safer
point and they scanned the approaching
surface with the greatest of care

   do either of you fellows see anything
green demanded the engineer a little
later they were silent each had noticed
long before that not even near the poles
was there the slightest sign of vegetation

  no chance unless theres foliage
muttered the doctor half to himself the
builder asked what he meant he ex-
plained so far as we know all animal
life depends upon vegetation for its oxy-
gen not only the oxygen in the air but
that stored in the plants which animals
eat unless theres greenery-

  he paused at a low exclamation from
smith the engineers eyes were fixed in
wonder and excitement upon that part of
the valley which lay at the joint of the
l below them it was perhaps six miles
across and all over the comparatively
smooth surface jutted dark projections
viewed through the glasses they had a
regular uniform appearance

  by jove exclaimed the doctor al-
most in awe he leaned forward and
scrubbed the deadlight for the tenth time
all four men strained their eyes to see

  it was the architect who broke the
silence which followed the other three
were content to let the thrill of the thing
have its way with them such a feeling
had little weight with the expert in
archeology

  well he declared jubilantly in his
boyish voice either i eat my hat or thats
a city

as swiftly as an elevator drops
and as safely the cube shot straight
downward every second the landscape
narrowed and shrunk leaving the remain-
ing details larger clearer sharper bit
by bit the amazing thing below them re-
solved itself into a real metropolis

  within five minutes they were less
than a mile above it smith threw on more
current so that the descent stopped and
the cube hung motionless in space

  for another five minutes the four men

studied the scene in nervous silence each
knew that the others were looking for
thesame thing-some sign of life a little
spot of green or possibly something in
motion-a single whiff of smoke would
have been enough to cause a whoop of joy

   but nobody shouted there was nothing
 to shout about nowhere in all that local-
 ity apparently was there the slightest
 sign that any save themselves were alive

   instead the most extraordinary city
that man ever laid eyes upon was stretched
directly beneath it was grouped about
what seemed to be the meeting-point of
three great roads which led to this spot
from as many passes through the sur-
rounding hills and the city seemed thus
naturally divided into three segments of
equal size and shape and each with its
own street system

   for they undoubtedly were streets no
 metropolis on earth ever had its blocks
 laid out with such unvarying exactness
 this mercurian city contained none but
 perfect equilateral trianglesl and the
 streets themselves were of absolutely uni-
 form width

  the buildings however showed no
such uniformity on the outskirts the
blocks seemed to contain nothing save odd
heaps of dingy sun-baked mud on the
extreme north however lay five blocks
grouped together whose buildings like
those in the middle of the city were
rather tall square-cut and of the same
dusty cream-white hue

   down-town were several structures
especially prominent for their height they
towered to such an extent in fact that
their upper windows were easily made
out apparently they were hundreds of
stories high

   here and there on the streets could be
 seen small spots colored a darker buff
 than the rest of that dazzling landscape
 but not one of the spots was moving

   well go down further said the en-
 gineer tentatively in a low tone there
 was no comment he gradually reduced
 the repelling current so that the sky-car
 resumed its descent
the lord of death

 

  they sank down until they were on a
level with the top of one of those extra-
ordinary sky-scrapers the roof seemed
perfectly flat except for a large round
black opening in its center no one was
in sight

  when opposite the upper rows of win-
dows at a distance of perhaps twenty
feet smith brought the car to a halt
and they peered in there were no panes
the windows opened directly into a vast
room but nothing was clearly visible
in the blackness save the outlines of the
openings in the opposite walls

  they went down further keeping well
to the middle of the space above the
street at every other yard they kept a
sharp lookout for the inhabitants but so
far as thev could see their approach was
entirely unobserved 

  when within fifty yards of the sur-
face all four  men made a search for
cross-wires below they saw none there
were no poles even neither to their as-
tonishment was there such a thing as a
sidewalk the street stretched unbroken
by curbing from wall to wall and from
corner to corner

   as the cube settled slowly to the ground
the adventurers left the deadlight to use
the windows for a moment the view was
obscured by a swirl of dust raised by the
spurt of the current then this cloud
vanished settling to the ground with as-
tounding suddenness as though jerked
down by some invisible hand

  directly ahead of them perhaps a hun-
dred yards lay a yellowish-brown mass
of unusual octagonal shape one end con-
tained a small oval opening but the men
from the earth looked in vain for any
creature to emerge from it

  the doctor silently set to work with
his apparatus from an air-tight double-
doored compartment he obtained a sam-
ple of the ether outside the car and with
the aid of previously arranged chemicals
quickly learned the truth

  there was no air not only was there
no oxygen the element upon which all
known life depends but there was no

nitrogen no carbon dioxid not the
slightest trace of water vapor or of the
other less known elements which can be
found in small amounts in our own at-
mosphere clearly as the doctor said
whatever air the astronomers had ob-
served must exist on the circumference
of the planet only and not in this sun-
blasted north-central spot

   on the outer walls of the cube so ar-
ranged as to be visible through the win-
dows were various instruments the
barometer showed no pressure the ther-
mometer a specially devised one which
used gas instead of mercury showed a
temperature of six hundred degrees
fahrenheit

  no air no water and a baking heat
as the geologist remarked how could life
exist there but the architect suggested
that possibly there was some form of
life of which men knew nothing which
could exist under such circumstances

   they got out three of the suits these
were a good deal like those worn by
divers except that the outer layer was
made of non-conducting aluminum cloth
flexible air-tight and strong between it
and the inner lining was a layer of cells
into which the men now pumped several
pints of liquid oxygen the terrific cold
of this chemical made the heavy flannel
of the inner lining very welcome while
the oxygen itself as fast as it evaporated
revitalized the air within the big glass-
faced helmet

  once safely locked within the clumsy
suits jackson van emmon and smith
took their places within the vestibule
while the doctor who had volunteered to
to stay behind watched them open
the outer door with a hiss all the air in
the vestibule rushed out and the doctor
earnestly thanked his stars that the inner
door had been built very strongly

  the men stepped out on to the ground
at first they moved with great care being
uncertain that their feet were weighted
heavily enough to counteract the reduced
gravitation of the tiny planet but they
had been living in a very peculiar condi-


famous fantastic mysteries

tion gravitationally speaking for the past
three days and they quickly adapted
themselves

  after a little shifting about the three
artificial monsters gave their telephone
wires another scrutiny then keeping al-
ways within ten feet of each other so as
not to throw any strain on the connec-
tions they strode in a matter-of-fact way
toward the nearest doorway

  for a moment or two they stood ut-
side the queer peaked archway their
glimmering suits standing out oddly in the
blinding sunlight then they advanced
boldly into the opening in a flash they
vanished from the doctors sight and the
inklike blackness of the opening again
stared at him from that dazzling wall

chapter iii

the house of dust

the geologist strong man that he was
and by profession an investigator of
the unknown-van emmon-took the
lead he stalked straight ahead into a
vast space which without any preliminary
hallway filled the entire triangular block

  before their eyes were accustomed to
the shadow-pretty cold murmured the
architect into the phone transmitter it
was fastened to the inside of the helmet
directly in front of his mouth while the
receiver was placed beside his ear all
three stopped short to adjust each others
electrical heating apparatus to do this
they did not use their fingers directly
they manipulated ingenious non-magnetic
pliers attached to the ends of fingerless
insulated mittens

  before they had finished the builder
who had been puzzling over the extraor-
dinary suddenness with which that cloud
of dust had settled received an inspira-
tion he was carrying note-book and
camera with his pliers he tore out a sheet
from the former and holding book in one
hand and the leaf in the other he allowed
them to drop at the same instant

  they reached the ground together

see the architect repeated the ex-

periment back home where theres air
the paper would have floated down it
would have taken three times as long for
it to fall as the book

  smith nodded but he had been think-
ing of something else he said gravely
remember what i told you-its air that
insulates the earth from the ether if
theres no air here-he glanced out into
the pitiless sunlight-then i hope theres
no flaw in our insulation were walking
in an electrical bath

  they looked around objects were
pretty distinct now they could easily see
that the floor was covered with what ap-
peared to be machines laid out in orderly
fashion here however as outside every-
thing was coated with that fine cream-
colored dust it filled every nook and
cranny it stirred about their feet with
every step

  the geologist led the way down a broad
aisle on either side of which towered im-
mense machinery smith was for stopping
to examine them one by one but the
others vetoed the engineers passion and
strode on toward the end of the triangle
more than anything else they looked for
the absent population to show itself

  suddenly van emmon stopped short
is it possible that theyre all asleep
he added that even though the sun shone
steadily the year aroilnd the people must
take times for rest

  but smith stirred the dust with his
foot and shook his head ive seen no
tracks this dust has been lying here for
weeks perhaps months if the folks are
away then they must be taking a com-
munity vacation

  at the end of the aisle they reached
a small railed-in space strongly resem-
bling what might be seen in any office on
the earth in the middle of it stood a low
flat-topped desk for all the world like
that of a prosperous real-estate agent ex-
cept that it was about half a foot lower
there was no chair for lack of a visible
gate in the railing the explorers stepped
over being careful not to touch it

  there was nothing on top of the desk
the lord of death



save the usual coat of dust below a very
wide space had been left for the legs of
whoever had used it and flanking this
space were two pedestals containing what
looked to be a multitude of exceedingly
small drawers smith bent and examined
them apparently they had no locks he
unhesitatingly reached out gripped the
knob of one and pulled

  noiselessly instantaneously the whole
desk crumbled to powder

  startled smith stumbled backward
knocking against the railing next instant
it lay on the floor its fragments scarcely
distinguishable from what had already
covered the surface only a tiny cloud of
dust arose and in half a second this had
settled

  the three looked at each other signifi-
cantly clearly the thing that had just
happened argued a great lapse of time since
the user of that desk officiated in that en-
closure it looked as though smiths guess
of weeks perhaps months would have
to be changed to years perhaps centuries

  feel all right asked the geologist
jackson and smith made affirmative
noises and again they stepped out this
time walking in the aisle along the outer
wall they could see their sky-car plainly
through the ovals

  here the machinery could be examined
more closely they resembled automatic
testing scales said smith the kind that
are used in weighing complicated metal
products after finishing and assembling
moreover they seemed to be connected
the one to the other with a series of end-
less belts these smith thought indicated
automatic production to all appearances
the dust-covered apparatus stood just as it
had been left when operations ceased an
unguessable length of time before

smith showed no desire to touch the
things now seeing this the geologist
deliberately reached out and scraped the
dust from the nearest machine to the
vast relief of all three no damage-was
done the dust fell straight to the floor
exposing a streak of greenish-white metal

  van emmon made another tentative
brush or so at other points with the
same result clean untarnished metal lay
beneath all that dust clearly it was some
non-conducting alloy whatever it was it
had successfully resisted the action of the
elements all the while that such presum-
ably wooden articles as the desk and rail-
ing had been steadily rotting

  emboldened smith clambered up on
the frame of one of the machines he ex-
amined it closely as to its cams clutches
gearing and other details significant
enough to his mechanical training he
noted their adjustments scrutinized the
conveying apparatus and came back car-
rying a cylindrical object which he had
removed from an automatic chuck

  this is what they were making he
remarked trying to conceal his excitement
the others brushed the dust from the
thing a huge piece of metal which would
have been too much for their strength on
the earth instantly they identified it

  it was a cannon shell

  again van emmon led the way they
took a reassuring glance out the window
at the familiar cube then passed along
the aisle toward the farther corner as they
neared it they saw that it contained a
small enclosure of heavy metal scrollwork
within which stood a triangular elevator

  the men examined it as closely as pos-
sible noting especially the extremely low
stool which stood upon its platform the
same unerodable metal seemed to have
been used throughout the whole affair

  when they returned to the heap of
powdered wood which had been the desk
smith spied a long work-bench under a
near-by window there they found a very
ordinary vise in which was clamped a piece
of metal but for the dust it might have
been placed there ten minutes before on
the bench lay several tools some familiar
to the engineer and some entirely strange
a set of screw-drivers of various sizes
caught his eye he picked them up and
again experienced the sensation of having
wood turn to dust at his touch the blades
were whole


famous fantastic mysteries

  still searching the engineer found a
square metal chest of drawers each of
which he promptly opened the contents
were laden with dust but he brushed this
off and disclosed a quantity of exceedingly
delicate instruments they were more like
dentists tools than machinists yet plainly
were intended for mechanical use

  one drawer held what appeared to be a
roll of drawings smith did not want to
touch them with infinite care he blew
off the dust with the aid of his oxygen
pipe after a moment or two the surface
was clear but it offered no encourage-
ment it was the blank side of the paper

  there was no help for it smith grasped
the roll firmly with his pliers-and the
next second gazed upon dust

  in the bottom drawer lay something
that aroused the curiosity of all three
these were small reels about two inches
in diameter and a quarter of an inch
thick each incased in a tight-fitting box
they resembled measuring tapes to some
extent except that the ribbons were made
of marvelously thin material van emmon
guessed that there were a hundred yards
in a roll smith estimated it at three hun-
dred they seemed to be made of a metal
similar to that composing the machines
smith pocketed them all

  under the bench they discovered a very
small machine decidedly like a stock
ticker except that it had no glass dome
but possessed at one end a curious metal
disk about a foot in diameter apparently
it had been undergoing repairs it was im-
possible to guess its purpose smiths pride
was instantly aroused he tucked it under
his arm and was impatient to get back to
the cube where he might more carefully
examine this find with the tips of his
fingers

  it was when they were about to leave
the building that they thought to inspect
walls and ceiling

  look-at that dust again howd it get
there van emmon paused while the
others the thought finally getting to them
felt a queer chill striking at the backs of
their necks men-theres only one way

for the dust to settle on a wall its got
to have air to carry it it couldnt pos-
sibly get there without air

  that dust settled long before life ap-
peared on the earth even its been there
ever since the air disappeared from mer-
cury 

chapter iv

the library

t thought youd never get back
a complained the doctor crossly when
the three entered they had been gone
just half an hour

  next moment he was studying their
faces and at once he demanded the most
important fact they told him and before
they had finished he was half-way into
another suit he was all eagerness but
somehow the three were very glad to be
inside the cube again and firmly insisted
upon moving to another spot before mak-
ing further explorations

  within a minute or two the cube was
hovering opposite the upper floor of the
building the three had entered with only
a foot of space separating the window of
the sky-car and the dust-covered wall the
men from the earth inspected the interior
at considerable length they flashed a
search-light all about the place and con-
cluded that it was the receiving room
where the raw iron billets were brought
via the elevator and from there slid to
the floor below at one end in exactly the
same location as the desk smith had de-
stroyed stood another with a low and
remarkably broad chair beside it

  so far as could be seen there were
neither doors window-panes nor shutters
through the structure to get all the
light and air they could guessed the doc-
tor perhaps thats why the buildings are
all triangular most wall surface in pro-
portion to floor area that way

  a few hundred feet higher they began
to look for prominent buildings

  we ought to learn something there
the doctor said after a while pointing out
a particularly large squat irregularly
the lord of death



built affair on the edge of the business
district the architect however was in
favor of an exceptionally large high build-
ing in the isolated group previously noted
in the suburbs but because it was
nearer they maneuvered first in the di-
rection of the doctors choice

  the sky-car came to rest in a large
plaza opposite what appeared to be the
structures main entrance

  the doctor was impatient to go smith
was willing enough to stay behind he was
already joyously examining the strange
machine he had found two minutes later
kinney van emmon and jackson were
standing before the portals of the great
building

  there they halted and no wonder the
entire face of the building could now be
seen to be covered with a mass of carv-
ings for the most part they were statues
in bas relief all were fantastic in the ex-
treme but whether purposely so or not
there was no way to tell certainly any
such work on the part of an earthly artist
would have branded him either as insane
or as an incomprehensible genius

  directly above the entrance was a group
which might have been labeled the tri-
umph of the brute an enormously pow-
erful man nearly as broad as he was tall
stood exulting over his victim a less ro-
bust figure prostrate under his feet both
were clad in armor

  the victors face was distorted into a
savage snarl startlingly hideous by rea-
son of the prodigious size of his head
planted as it was directly upon his shoul-
ders for he had no neck his eyes were
set so close together that at first glance
they seemed to be but one his nose was
flat and ape-like in type while his mouth
devoid of curves was revolting in its huge
thick-lipped lack of proportion his chin
was square and aggressive his forehead
strangely enough extremely high and
narrow rather than low and broad

  his victim lay in an attitude that in-
dicated the most agonizing torture -his
head was bent completely back and
around behind his shoulders on the

ground lay two battle-axes huge affairs
almost as heavy as the massively muscled
men who had used them

  but the eyes of the explorers kept com-
ing back to the fearsome face of the con-
queror from the brows down he was
simply a huge brutal giant above his
eyes he was an intellectual the combina-
tion was absolutely frightful the beast
looked capable of anything of overcom-
ing any obstacle mental or physical in-
ternal or external in order to assert his
apparently enormous will he could con-
trol himself or dominate others easily

  it cant be that he was drawn from
life said the doctor with an effort it
wasnt easy to criticize that figure life-
less though it was on a planet like this
with such slight gravitation there is no
need for such huge strength the typical
mrcurian should be tall and flimsy in
build rather than short and compact

  but the geologist differed we want to
remember that the earth has no standard
type think what a difference there i
betweei the mosquito and the elephant
the snake and the spider one would sup-
pose that they had been developed under
totally different planetary conditions in-
stead of all right on the same globe

  no i think this monster may have
been genuine and with that the geologist
turned to examine the other statuary

  without exception it resembled the
central group all the figures were neck-
less and all much more heavily built than
any people on earth there were several
female figures they had the same general
build and in every case were so placed as
to enhance the glory of the males in one
group the woman was offering up food
and drink to a resting worker in another
she was being carried off struggling in
the arms of a fairly good-looking war-
rior

  dr kinney led the way into the build-
ing as in the other structure there was
no door the space seemed to be but one
story in height although that had the
effect of a cathedral the whole of the
ceiling irregularly arched in a curious


famous fantastic mysteries

pointed manner was ornamented with
grotesque figures the walls were also
partially formed of squat semihuman
statues set upon huge triangular shafts
in the spaces between these outlandish
pilasters there had once been some sort
of decorations a great many photos were
taken here

  as for the floor it was divided in all
directions by low walls about five and
a half feet in height these walls separated
the great room into perhaps a hundred
triangular compartments each about the
size of an ordinary living-room broad
openings about five feet square provided
free access from one compartment to any
other the men from the earth by stand-
ing on tiptoes could see over and beyond
this system

  wonder if these walls were supposed
to cut off the view speculated the doc-
tor i mean do you suppose that the
mercurians were such short people as
that his question had to go unanswered

  they stepped into the nearest compart-
ment and were on the point of pronounc-
ing it bare when jackson with an ex-
clamation excitedly brushed away some
of the dust and showed that the presum-
ably solid walls were really chests of
drawers shallow things of that peculiar
metal these drawers numbered several
hundred to the compartment in the whole
building there must have been millions

once more the dust was carefully re-
moved revealing a layer of those
curious rolls or reels exactly similar to
what had been found in the tool chest in
the shell works a careful examination
of the metallic tape showed nothing what-
ever to the naked eye although the doc-
tor fancied that he made out some strange
characters on the little boxes themselves

  his view was shortly proved finding
drawer after drawer to contain a similar
display varying from one to a dozen of
of the diminutive ribbons van emmon
adopted the plan of gently blowing away
the dust from the faces of the drawers be-
fore opening them this revealed the fact

that each of the shallow things was neatly
labeled

  jnstantly the three were intent upon the
fresh clue the markings were very faint
and delicate the slightest touch being
enough to destroy them to the untrained
eye they resembled ancient egyptian
hieroglyphics to the archeologist they
meant that a brand-new system of ideo-
graphs had been found

  suddenly jackson straightened up and
looked about with a new interest he went
to one of the square doorways and very
carefully removed the dust from a small
plate on the lintel he need not have been
so careful engraved in the solid metal
was a single character plainly in the same
language as the other ideographs

  the architect smiled triumphantly into
the inquiring eyes of his friends i wont
have to eat my hat said he this is a
sure-enough city all right and this is its
library

  smith was still busy on the little ma-
chine when they returned to the cube
he said that one part of it had disap-
peared and was busily engaged in filing
a bit of steel to take its place as soon as
it was ready he thought they could see
what the apparatus meant

  the three had brought a large number
of the reels they were confident that a
microscopic search of the ribbons would
disclose something to bear out jacksons
theory that the great structure was really
a repository for books or whatever cor
responded with books on mercury

  but the main thing said the doctor
enthusiastically is to get over to the
twilight band im beginning to have all
sorts of wild hopes

  jackson urged that they first visit the
big mansion on the outskirts of this
place he said he felt sure somehow that
it would be worth while but van em
mon backed up the doctor and i he archi
tect had to be content with an agreement
to return in case their trip was futile

  inside of a few minutes the cube was
being drawn steadily over loward the left
or western edge of the planets sunlit
the lord of death



face as it moved all except smith kept
close watch on the ground below they
made out town after town as well as
separate buildings and on the roads were
to be seen a great many of those octagonal
structures all motionless

  after several hundred miles of this the
surface abruptly sloped toward what had
clearly been the bed of an ocean no sign
of habitation here however so appar-
ently the water had disappeared after the
humans had gone

  this ancient sea ended a short distance
from the district they were seeking a
little more travel brought them to a point
where the sun cast as much shadow as
light on the surface it was here they
descended coming to rest on a sunlit knoll
which overlooked a small building-filled
valley

  according to kinneys apparatus there
was about one-fortieth the amount of air
that exists on the earth of water vapor
there was a trace but all their search re-
vealed no human life not only that but
there was no trace of lower animals there
was not even a lizard much less a bird
and even the most ancient-looking of the
sculptures showed no creatures of the air
only huge antediluvian monsters were
ever depicted

  they took a great many photos as a
matter of course also they investigated
some of the big octagonal machines in the
streets finding them to be similar to the
great tanks used in war on earth ex-
cept that they did not have the caterpil-
lar tread their eight faces were so linked
together that the entire affair could roll
after a jolting slab-sided flopping fash-
ion inside were curious engines and
sturdy machines designed to throw the
cannon-shells the visitors had seen no
explosive was employed apparently but
centrifugal force generated in whirling
wheels apparently these cars or chariots
were universally used

  the explorers returned to the cube
where they found that smith happening
to look out a window had spied a pond
not far off the three visited it and found

on its banks the first green stuff they
had seen a tiny flowerless salt grass
very scarce it bordered a slimy bluish
pool of absolutely still fluid nobody would
call it water they took a few samples of
it and went back

  and within a few minutes the doctor
slid a small glass slide into his microscope
and examined the object with much satis-
faction what he saw was a tiny gelatin-
like globule among scientists it is known
as the amoeba it is the simplest form of
life-the so-called single cell it had
been the first thing to live on that planet
and apparently it was also the last

chapter v

the closed door

as they neared jacksons pet man-
sion each man paid close atten-
tion to the intervening blocks for the
most part these were simply shapeless
ruins heaps of what had once been per-
haps brick or stone

  apparently the locality they were ap-
proaching had been set aside as a very
exclusive residence district for the elite
of the country possibly it contained the
homes of the royalty assuming that there
had been a royalty at any rate the con-
spicuous structure jackson had selected
was certainly the home of the most im-
portant member of that colony

  when the three once more in their
helmets and suits stood before the low
broad portico which protected the en-
trance to that edifice the first thing they
made out was an ornamental frieze run-
ning across the face in the same bold
realistic style as the other sculpture there
was depicted a hand-to-hand battle be-
tween two groups of those half savage
half cultured monstrosities and in the
background was shown a glowing orb
obviously the sun

  see that exclaimed the doctor the
size of that sun i mean compare it with
the way old sol looks now

  they took a single glance at the great
ball of fire over their heads nine times


famous fantastic mysteries

the size it always seemed at home it con-
trasted sharply with the rather small
ball shown in the carvings

  understand the doctor went on
when that sculpture was made mer-
cury was little nearer the sun than the
earth is now

  the builder was hugely impressed he
asked eagerly then probably the people
became as highly developed as we

  van emmon nodded approvingly but
the doctor was opposed no i think
not jackson mercury never did have as
much air as the earth and consequently
had much less oxygen and the struggle
for existence he went on watching to
see if the geologist approved each point
as he made it the struggle for life is in
the last analysis a struggle for oxygen

   so i would say that life was a pretty
strenuous proposition here while it
lasted perhaps they were- he stopped
then added what i cant understand is
how did it happen that their affairs came
to such an abrupt end and why dont
we see any-er-indications

  skeletons the architect shuddered
next second though his face lit up with
a thought i remember reading that elec-
tricity will decompose bone in time and
then he shuddered again as his foot stirred
that lifeless impalpable dust

   as they passed into the great house the
first thing they noted was the floor un-
divided dust-covered and bare except
for what had perhaps been rugs the
shape was the inevitable equilateral tri-
angle and here with a certain magnifi-
cent disregard for precedent the builders
had done away with a ceiling entirely
and instead had sloped the three walls
up till they met in a single point a hun-
dred feet overhead

  in one corner a section of the floor
was elevated perhaps three feet above
the rest and directly back of this was a
broad doorway set in a short wall the
three advanced at once toward it

  here the electric torch came in very
handy it disclosed a poorly lighted stair
way very broad unrailed and prepos-

terously steep the steps were each over
three feet high

  difference in gravitation said the
doctor in response to jacksons question-
ing look easy enough for the old-timers
perhaps they struggled up the flight as
best they could reaching the top after
over five minutes of climbing

  perhaps it was the reaction from this
exertion at all events each felt a distinct
loss of confidence as after regaining their
wind they began to explore neither said
anything about it to the others but each
noted a queer sense of foreboding far
more disquieting than either of them had
felt when investigating anything else it
may have been due to the fact that in
their hurry they had not stopped to eat

  the floor they were on was fairly well
lighted with the usual oval windows the
space was open except that it contained
the same kind of dividing walls they had
found in the library here however each
compartment contained but one opening
and that not uniformly placed in fact
as the three noted with a growing un-
easiness it was necessary to pass through
every one of them in order to reach the
corner farthest from the ladderlike stairs
why it should make them tineasy neither
could have said

when they were almost through the
labyrinth van emmon after stand-
ing on tiptoes for the tenth time in order
to locate himself noted something that
had escaped their attention before these
compartments used to be covered over
he said for some reason lowering his
voice he pointed out niches in the walls
such as undoubtedly once held the ends
of heavy timbers what was this place
anyhow a trap

   unconsciously they lightened their steps
as they neared the last compartment
they found as expected that it was an-
other stairway van emmon turned the
light upon every corner of the place be-
fore going any further but except for a
formless heap of rubbish in one comer
it was bare as the rest of the floor
the lord of death



  again they climbed this time for a
much shorter distance but jackson
slightly built chap that he was needed a
little help on the steep stairs they were
not sorry that they had reached the up-
permost floor of the mansion it was
somewhat better lighted than the floor
below and they were relieved to find that
the triangular compartments did not have
the significant niches in their walls their
spirits rose perceptibly

  at the corner farthest from the stairs
one of the walls rose straight to the ceil-
ing completely cutting off a rather large
triangle the three paid no attention to
the other compartments but went straight
to what they felt sure was the most vital
spot in the place and their feelings were
justified with a vengeance when they saw
that the usual doorway in this wall was
protected by something that had so far
been entirely missing everywhere else

  it was barred by a heavy door

  for several moments the doctor the
geologist and the architect stood before
it neither would have liked to admit that
he would just as soon leave that door
unopened all the former uneasiness came
back it was all the more inexplicable
with the brilliant sunlight only a few feet
away that each should have felt chilled
by the place

  wonder if its locked remarked
van emmon he pressed against the dust-
covered barrier half expecting it to turn
to dust but evidently it had been made
of the time-defying alloy it stood firm
and it seemed nearly airtight

  well said the doctor suddenly so
that the other two started nervously  the
doors got to come down thats all
they looked around there was no furni-
ture no loose piece of material of any
kind van emmon straightway backed
away from the door about six feet and the
others followed his example

  all together grunted the geologist
and the three aluminum-armored mon-
sters charged the door it shook under tfte
impact a shower of dust fell down and
they saw that they had loosened the thing

  once more this time a wide crack
showed all around the edge of the door
and the third attempt finished the job
noiselessly-for there was no air to carry
the sound-but with a heavy jar which all
three felt through their feet the barrier
went flat on the floor beyond

  at that same instant a curious invisible
wave like a tiny puff of wind floated out
of the darkness and passed by the three
men from the earth each noticed it but
no one mentioned it at the time van
emmon was already searching the dark-
ness with the torch

  apparently it was only an anteroom a
few feet beyond was another wall and
in it stood another door larger and heavier
than the first the three did not stop
they immediately tried their strength on
this one also

  after a half dozen attempts without
so much as shaking the massive affair-
its no use panted the geologist wish-
ing that he could get a handkerchief to his
forehead we cant loosen it without
tools

  jackson was for trying again but the
doctor agreed with van emmon they
reflected that they had been away from
smith long enough anyhow the cube was
out of sight from where they were

  van emmon turned the light on the
walls of the anteroom and found on a
shelf at one end a neat pile of those
little reels eleven in all he pocketed the
lot there was nothing else

  jackson and kinney started to go

  look here van emmon said in a low
strained voice they went to his side and
instinctively glanced behind them before
looking at what lay in the dust

  it was the imprint of an enormous
human foot

the first thing that greeted the ears
of the explorers upon taking off their
suits in the sky-car was the exultant
voice of smith he was too excited to
notice anything out of the way in their
manner he was almost dancing in front
of his bench where the unknown machine


famous fantastic mysteries

now reconstructed stood belted to a small
electric motor

  it runs he was shouting you got
here just in time he began to fumble
with a switch

  what of it remarked the doctor in
the bland tone which he kept for occa-
sions when smith needed calming what
will it do if it does run

  the engineer looked blank why-
then he remembered and picked up one
of the reels at random theres a clamp
here just the right size to hold one of
these he explained fitting the ribbon into
place and threading its free end into a loop
on a spool which looked as though made
for it but his excitement had passed he
now cautiously set a small anvil between
himself and the apparatus and then with
the aid of a long stick he threw on the
current

  for a moment nothing happened save
the hum of the motor then a strange
leafy rustling sounded from the mechan-
ism next without any warning a high-
pitched voice nasal and plaintive but
distinctly human spoke from the big metal
disk

   the words were unintelligible the lan-
guage was totally unlike anything ever
heard on the earth and yet deliberately
if somewhat cringingly the voice pro-
ceeded with what was apparently a reci-
tation

   as the thing went on the four men came
closer and watched the operation of the
machine the ribbon unrolled slowly it
was plain that if the one topic occupied
the whole reel then it must have the
length of an ordinary book chapter and
as the voice continued certain dramatic
qualities came out and governed the
words utterly incomprehensible though
they were there was a real thrill to it

  after a while they stopped the thing
no use listening to this now as the
doctor said weve got to learn a good
deal more about these people before we
can guess what it all means

  and yet although all were hungry on
jacksons suggestion they tried out one

of the records that was brought from
that baffling room smith was very much
interested in that unopened door and he
and van emmon were in the midst of dis-
cussing it when jackson started the
motor

  the geologists words stuck in his
throat the disk was actually shaking with
the vibrations of a most terrific voice
prodigiously loud and powerful its boom-
ing resonant bass smote the ears like the
roll of thunder it was irresistible in its
force compelling in its assurance mas-
terful and strong to an overpowering de-
gree involuntarily the men from the
earth stepped back

   on it roared and rumbled speaking the
same language as that of the other record
but whereas the first speaker merely used
the words the last speaker demolished
them one felt that he had extracted every
ounce of power in the language leaving
it weak and flabby unfit for further use
he threw out his sei nces as though
done with them not boldly not defiantly
least of all tentatively he spoke with a
certainty and force that came from a
knowledge that he could compel rather
than induce his hearers to believe

   it took a little nerve to shut him off
van emmon was the one who did it
somehow they all felt immensely relieved
when the gigantic voice was silenced and
at once began discussing the thing with
great earnestness jackson was for assum-
ing that the first record was worn and
old the last one fresh and new but after
examining both tapes under a glass and
seeing how equally clear cut and sharp the
impressions all were they agreed that the
extraordinary voice they had heard was
practically true to life

   they tried out the rest of the records
in that batch finding that they were all
by the same speaker nowhere among the
ribbons brought from the library was an-
other of his making although a great
number of different voices was included
neither was there another talker with the
volume the resonance the absolute power
of conviction of this unknown colossus
the lord of death



  this is not place to describe the labori-
ous process of interpreting these docu-
ments records of a past which was gone
before earths mankind had even begun
the work involved the study of countless
photos covering everything from inscrip-
tions to parts of machinery and other de-
tails which furnished clue after clue to
that superancient language it was not
deciphered in fact until several years
after the explorers had submitted their
find to the worlds foremost lexicographers
antiquarians and paleontologists even
today some of it is disputed

  but right here is most emphatically the
place to insert the tale told by that un-
paralleled voice and incredible though it
may seem as judged by the standards of

the peoples of this earth the account is
fairly proved by the facts uncovered by
the expedition it would be only begging
the question to doubt the genuineness of
the thing and if understanding the lan-
guage one were to hear the original as it
fell word for word from the iron mouth
of strokor the great in the mercurian
language strok means iron or heart-
hearing that one would believe none
could doubt nor would

  and so it does not do him justice to
set it down in ordinary print one must
imagine the story being related by strokor
himself must conceive of each word fall-
ing like the blow of a mammoth sledge x
the tale was not told-it was bellowed
and this is how it ran

part ii
the story

chapter i

the man

i am strokor son of strok the armorer
i am strokor a maker of tools of war
strokor the mightiest man in the world
strokor whose wisdom outwitted the
hordes of klow strokor who has never
feared and never failed let him who
dares dispute it i-i am strokor

  in my youth i was as now the marvel
of all who saw i was ever robust and
daring and naught but much older bigger
lads could outdo me i balked at nothing
be it a game or a battle it was and
forever shall be my chief delight to best
all others

  twas from my mother that i gained
my huge frame and sound heart in truth
i am very like her now that i think
upon it she too was indomitable in bat-
tle and famed for her liking for strife
no doubt twas her stalwart figure that
caught my fathers fancy

  aye my mother was a very likely
woman but she boasted no brains  need
no cunning i remember she said she
was a grand woman slow to anger and a
match for many a good pair of men often

as a lad have i carried the marks of her
punishment for the most of a year

  and thus it seems that i owe my head
to my father he was a marvelously clever
man dexterous with hand and brain alike
moreover he was no weakling perchance
i should credit him with some of my
agility for he was famed as a gymnast
though not a powerful one twas he who
taught me how to disable my enemy with
a mere clutch of the neck at a certain
spot

  but strok the armorer was feared most
because of his brain and his knack of
using his mind to the undoing of others
and he taught me all that he knew
taught me all that he had learned in a
lifetime of fighting for the emperor of
mending the complicated machines in the
armory of contact with the chemists who
wrought the secret alloy and the chiefs
who led the army

  when i became a man he abruptly
ended his teaching i think he saw that i
was become as dexterous as he with the
tools of the craft and he feared lest i
know more than he well he might the
day i realized this i laughed long and
loud and from that time forth he taught


famous fantastic mysteries

me not because he chose to but because
i bent a chisel in my bare hands before
his eyes and told him his place

  many times he strove to trick me and
more than once he all but caught me in
some trap he was a crafty man and
relied not upon brawn but upon wits
yet i was ever on the watch and i but
learned the more from him

  ye are very kind i mocked him one
morning when i had taken my seat a
huge weight had dropped from above and
crushed my stool to splinters much as it
would have crushed my skull had i not
leaped instantly aside ye are kinder
than most fathers who teach their sons
nothing at all

   he foamed at his mouth in his rage and
discomfiture insolent whelp he snarled
thou art quick as a cat on thy feet

   but i was not to be appeased by words
i smote him on the chest with my bare
hand so that he fell on the far side of
the room

  the time came when i saw that my
father was reconciled to his master  saw
that he genuinely admitted my prowess
and where he formerly envied me he
now took great pride in all i accomplished
and claimed that it was but his own
brains acting through my body

  i must admit too that i owe a great
deal to that gray-beard maka the star-
gazer

i met maka on the very morn that i
first laid eyes on the girl ave

  i was returning from the northland at
the time a rumor had come down to
vlama that one of the people in the snow
country had seen a lone specimen of the
mulikka now these were but a myth no
man living remembers when the carvings
on the house of learning were made and
all the wise men say that it hath been
ages since any being other than man
roamed the world yet i was young i
determined to search for the thing any-
how and twas only after wasting many
days in the snow that i cursed my luck
and turned back

   i was afoot for the going was too rough
for my chariot i had not yet quit the
wilderness before from a height i spied
a group of people ascending from the
valley knowing not whether they be
friends or foes i hid beside the path up
which they must come for i was weary
and wanting no strife

  yet i became alert enough when the
three-they were two ditch-tenders one
old one young and a girl-came within
earshot for they were quarreling it
seemed that the young man who was
plainly eager to gain the girl had fouled
in a try to force her favor the older man
chided him hotly

  and just when they came opposite my
rock the younger man whose passion had
got the better of him suddenly tripped
the older so that he fell upon the ledge
and would have fallen to his death on
the rocks below had not the girl crying
out in her terror leaped forward and
caught his hand

  at once the ditch-tender took the lass
about the waist and strove to pull her
away for a moment she held fast and
in that moment i strokor stood forth
from behind the rock

  now be it known that i am no cham-
pion of weaklings i was but angered that
the ditch-tender should have done the
trick so clumsily and upon an old man
at that i cared not for the gray beard
nor what became of the chit i clapped the
trickster upon the shoulder and spun him
about

  ye clumsy coward i jeered have
ye had no practice that ye should trip
the old one no better than that

  who are ye he stuttered like the
coward he was i laughed and helped the
chit drag maka-for it was he-up to
safety

   i am a far better man than ye i said
not caring to give my name and i can
show ye how the thing should be done
come at me if ye are a man

  at that he dashed upon me and such
was his fear of ridicule-for the girl was
laughing him to scorn now-he put up a
the lord of death



fair stiff fight but i forgot my weariness
when he foully clotted me on the head
with a stone  drove at him with all the
speed and suddenness my father had
taught me caught the fellow by the ankle
and brought him down atop me

  the rest was easy i bent my knee
under his middle and tossed him high
in a flash i was upon my feet and caught
him from behind and in another second
i had rushed him to the cliff and when
he turned to save himself i tripped him
as neatly as father himself could have
done it so that the fellow will guard the
ditch no more save in the caverns of
hofe

  i laughed and picked up my pack my
head hurt a bit from the fellows blow but
a little water would do for that i started
to go

  ye are a brave man cried the girl
i turned carelessly and then quite for
the first time i had a real look at her

  she was in no way like any woman i
had seen all of them had been much like
the men brawny and close-knit as well
fitted for their work as are men for war
but this chit was all but slender not
skinny but prettily rounded out and soft
like i cannot say that i admired her at
first glance she seemed fit only to look
at not to live i was minded of some of
the ancient carvings which show delicate
lightly built animals that have long since
been killed off graceful trifles that rested
the eye

  as for the old man aye thou art
brave and wondrous strong my lad said
he still a bit shaky from his close call
i was pleased with the acknowledgment
and turned back

  it was nothing i told them and i
recounted some of my exploits notably
one in which i routed a raiding party of
men from klow six in all carrying in
two alive on my shoulders i am the
son of strok the armorer

  ye are strokor marveled the girl
staring at me as though i were -a- god
then she threw back her head and stepped
close

 i am ave this is maka he is my
uncle but best known as a star-gazer my
father was durok the engine-maker
durok i knew him well my father
had said that he was quite as brainy as
himself he was a fine man ave
aye said she proudly she stepped
closer i could not but see how like him
she was though a woman and next sec-
ond she laid a hand on my arm

  i am yet a free woman strokor hast
thou picked thy mate and her cheeks
flamed

  now twas not my first experience of
the kind many women had looked like
that at me before but i had always been
a mans man and had ever heeded my
fathers warning to have naught what-
ever to do with women they are the
worst trick of all he told me and i had
never forgot belike i owe much of my
power to just this

  but ave had acted too quickly for me
to get away i laughed again and shook
her off

  i will have naught to do with ye i
told her civilly enough when i am
ready to take a woman i shall take her
not before

  at that the blood left her face she
stood very straight and her eyes flashed
dangerously were she a man i should
have stood on my guard but she made no
move only the softness in her eyes gave
way to such a savage look that i was
filled with amaze

  and thus i left them the old man call-
ing down the blessing of jon upon me
for having saved his life and the chit
glaring after me as though no curses
would suffice

  a right queer matter i thought at the
time i guessed not what would come of
it not then

chapter ii

the vision

rpwas a fortnight later more or less
a when next i saw maka i was lum-
bering along in my chariot feeling most


famous fantastic mysteries

uncomfortable under the eyes of my
friends for one foot of my machine had
a loose link and twas flapping absurdly
and i liked it none too well when maka
stopped his own rattletrap in front of
mine and came running to my window
next moment i forgot his impertinence

  strokor he whispered his face alive
with excitement thou art a brave lad
and didst save my life now know you
that a party of the men of klow have
secreted themselves under the stairway
behind the emperors throne they have
killed the guards and will of a certainty
kill the emperor too

   twould serve the dolt right i re-
plied for i really cared but little but
why have ye come to me old man i am
but a lieutenant in the armory i am not
the captain of the palace guard

  because he answered gazing at me
very pleasingly thou couldest dispose of
the whole party single handed-there are
but four-and gain much elory for thy-
self

  by jon i swore vastly delighted
and without stopping to ask maka whence
he had got his knowledge  went at once
to the spot however when i got back
i sought the star-gazer i ought to men-
tion that i had no trouble with the louts
and that the emperor himself saw me
finishing of the last of them i sought the
star-gazer and demanded how he had
known

  hast ever heard of edam he in-
quired in return

 edam i had not the name was
strange to me who is he

  a man as young as thyself but a mere
stripling quoth maka he was a pupil
of mine when i taught in the house of
learning of late he has turned to
prophecy and it is fair remarkable how
well the lad doth guess at all events
twas he strokor who told me of the
plot he saw it in a dream

  then edam must yet be in vlama
said i if he were able to tell ye canst
bring him to me i would know him

  and so it came about that on the eve

of that same day maka brought edam to
my house i remember it well for twas
the same day that the emperor in grati-
tude of my little service in the anteroom
had relieved me from my post in the
armory and made me captain of the
palace guard i was thus become the
youngest captain also the biggest and
strongest and as will soon appear bv
jar the longest-headed

  i was in high good humor and had
decided to celebrate with a feast so when
my two callers arrived  sat them down
before a magnificent meal

  edam was a slightly built lad not at all
the sturdy man that i am but of less than
half the weight his head too was un-
like mine his forehead was wide as well
as tall and his eyes were mild as a slaves

  ye are very young to be a prophet
i said to him after we were filled and
the slaves had cleared away our litter
tell me hast foretold anything else that
has come to pass

  aye he replied not at all boldly but
what some call modestly i prophesied
the armistice which now stands between
our empire and klows

  is this true i demanded of maka
the old man bowed his head gravely and
looked upon the young man with far more
respect than i felt he added

  tell strokor the dream thou hadst
two nights ago edam it were a right
strange tiling whether true or not

  the stripling shifted his weight on his
stool and moved the bowl closer then
he thrust his pipe deep into it and let
the liquid flow slowly out his nostrils
a curious custom among the mercurians
who had no tobacco there is no other
way to explain some of the carvings
doubtless the liquid was sweet-smelling
and perhaps slightly narcotic

  i saw this he began immediately
before rising and after a very light sup-
per so i know that it was a vision from
jon and not of my own making

  i was standing upon the summit of
a mountain and gazing down upon a very
large fertile valley it was heavily woqded
the lord of death



dark green and inviting but what first
drew my attention was a great number
of animals moving about in the air they
were passing strange affairs some large
ome small variously colored and they
were all covered with the same sort of
fur quite unlike any hair i have ever
seen

  in the air i echoed recovering from
my astonishment then i laughed might-
ily man ye must be crazy there is no
animal can live in the airl ye must mean
in the water or on land

  nay interposed the star-gazer
thou hast never studied the stars
strokor or thou wouldst know that there
be a number of them which through the
enlarging tube show themselves to be
round worlds like unto our own

  and it doth further appear that these
other worlds also have air like this we
breathe and that some have less while
others have even more from what edam
has told me finished the old man i
judge that his vision took place on jeos
the mercurian word for earth a world
much larger than ours according to my
calculations and doubtless having enough
air to permit very light creatures to move
about in it

  go on said i to edam good humor-
edly i be ever willing to believe anything
strange when my stomach is full

the dreamer had taken no offense
he went on then i bent my gaze
closer as i am always able in visions
arid i saw the greenery was most remark-
ably dense tangled and luxuriant to a de-
gree not ever seen here and moving about
in it was the most extraordinary collec-
tion of beings that i have ever laid these
eyes upon

  there were some huge creatures quite
as tall as thy house strokor with legs as
big around as that huge chest of thine
they had tails as had our ancient mu-
likka save that these were terrific things
as long and as big as the trunk of ajarge
tree i know not their names probably
the dinosaur

  but nowhere was there a sign of a
man true there was one hairy grotesque
creature which hung by its hands and feet
from the tree-tops very like thee in some
way strokor but its face and head were
those of a brainless beast not of a man
nowhere was there a creature like me or
thee

  and the most curious thing was this
although there were ten times as many of
these creatures big and little to the same
space as on our world yet there was no
great amount of strife in truth there is
far more combat and destruction among
we men than among the beasts

  and he spoke almost earnestly as
though he would not care to be disbe-
lieved i saw fathers fight to protect their
young

  i near fell from my stool in my amaze
never in all my life had i heard a
thing so far from the fact what i
shouted ye sit there like a sane man
and tell me ye saw fathers fight for their
young

  he nodded his head still very gravely

  faugh i spat upon the ground
such softness makes me ill ill be glad
i were born in a mans world where i can
take a mans chances i want no favoring
if i am strong enough to live i live if
not i die what more can i ask

  aye my lari said maka approvingly
this be a world for the strong there is
no room here for others there is scarce
enough food for those who thanks to their
strength do survive he slipped the gold
band from off his wrist and held it up for
jon to see here strokor a pledge a
pledge to-the survival of the fittest

  a neat neat wording i roared as i
took the pledge with him then we both
stopped short edam had not joined us

  edam my lad spake the old man
ye will take the pledge with us

  i have no quarrel with either of ye
edam got to his feet and started to the
door but i cannot take the pledge with
ye

  i have seen a wondrous thing and i
love it and though i know not why i


famous fantastic mysteries

feel that jon has willed it for jeos to see
a new race of men a race even better
than ours

  i leaped to my feet better than
ours mean ye to say stripling that there
can be a better man than strokor

  i fully expected him to shrink from me
in fear i was able to crush him with one
blow but he stood his ground nay
stepped forward and laid a hand easily
upon my shoulder

  strokor-ye are more than a man ye
are two men in one there is no finer-
i say it fair and yet i doubt not that
there can be and will be a better

  and with that such a curious expression
came into his face such a glow of some
strange kind of warmth that i let my hand
drop and suffered him to depart in peace
such was my wonder

  besides any miserable lout could have
destroyed the lad

  maka sat deep in thought for a time
and when he did speak he made no men-
tion of the lad who had just quit us in-
stead he looked me over long and ear-
nestly and at the end he shook his head
sorrowfully and sighed

  thou art the sort of a son i would
have had strokor given the wits of thy
father to hold l woman like thy mother
and thou didst save my life

  he mused a little longer then roused
himself and spake sharply

  strokor thou hast everything needful
to tickle thy vanity thou hast the envy
of those who note thy strength the praise
of them who love thy courage and the re-
spect of they who value thy brains all
these thou hast and yet ye have not that
which is best

  i thought swiftly and turned on him
with a frown mean ye that i am not
handsome enough

  nay strokor quoth the star-gazer
there be none handsomer in this world
no matter what the standard on any other
such as edams jeos

  it is not that it is that thou hast no
ambition

  i considered this deeply at first

thought it was not true had i not always
made it a point to best my opponent
frorit my youth it had been ever my cus-
tom to succeed where bigger bodies and
older minds had failed was not this am-
bition

  but before i disputed the point with
maka i saw what he meant i had no final
ambition no ultimate goal for which to
strive i had been content from year to
year to outdo each rival as he came before
me and now with mind and body alike
in the pink of condition i was come to the
place where none durst stand before me

  ye are right maka i admitted not
because i cared to gratify his conceit but
because it were always for my own good
to own up when wrong that i might
learn the better ye are right i need to
decide upon a life-purpose what have ye
thought

  the old man was greatly pleased our
talk with edam brought it all before me
know you strokor that the survival of
the fittest is a rule which governs man as
well as men it applies to the entire popu-
lation strokor just as truly as to me or
thee

  in fine we men who are now the sole
inhabitants of this world ate descended
from a race of people who survived solely
because they were fitter than the mulikka
fitter than the reptiles the fittest by far
of all the creatures

  that being the case it is plain that in
time either our empire or that of klows
must triumph over the other and that
which remains shall be the fittest

  hold i cried why cannot matters
remain just as they now are

  that he said rapidly is because
thou knowest so little about the future
of this world it is now known that the
sun is a very powerful magnet and that
he is constantly pulling upon our world
and bringing it nearer and nearer to him-
self that is why it hath become slightly
warmer during the past hundred years
the records show it plain and the same
influence has caused the lengthening of
our day
the lord of death

bi

  he stopped and let me think soon i
saw it clearly enough a time must come
when the increasing warmth of the sun
would stifle all forms of vegetable life and
that would mean the choking of mankind
it might take untold centuries yet
plainly enough the world must some day
become too small for even those who now
remained upon it

  suddenly i leaped to my feet and strode
the room in my excitement ye are right
maka i shouted thoroughly aroused
there cannot always be the two empires
in time one or the other must prevail
jon has willed it and-i stopped short
and stared at him-i need not tell ye
which it shall be

  i knew thou wouldst see the light
strokor thou hast thy fathers brains

  i sat me down but instantly leaped up
again such was my enthusiasm maka

i cried our emperor is not the man for
the place it is true that he was a brave
warrior in his youth he won the throne
fairly and we have suffered him to keep
it because he is a wise man and because
we have had little trouble with the men pf
klow since their defeat two generations
gone

  but he today is content to sit at his
ease and quote platitudes about live and
let live faugh i am ashamed that i
should even have given ear to him

  i stopped short and glared at the old
man maka hark ye well if it be the
will of jon to decide between klow and
the men of vlamaland then it is my
intent to hasten this decision

  aye my lad he said tranquilly and
then he added quite as though he knew
what my answer must be how do ye
intend to go about it

  like a man i strokor shall become
the emperor

chapter iii

the throne

a small storm had come ujjwhile
maka and i were talking now as
he was about to quit me the clouds were

clearing away and an occasional stroke of
lightning came down one of these how-
ever hit the ground such a short distance
away that both of us could smell the
smoke

  my mind was more alive than it had
ever been before now what caused that
maka the lightning i mean we have it
nearly every day yet i have never thought
to question it before

  it is no mystery my lad quoth
maka dodging into his chariot so that he
was not wet i myself have watched the
thing from the top of high mountains
where the air is so light that a man can
scarce get enough to fill his lungs and i
say unto you that were it not for what
air we have we should have naught save
the lightning the space about the air is
full of it

  he started his engine then leaned out
into the rain and said softly hold fast
to what thy father has taught thee stro-
kor have nothing to do with the women
tis a mans job ahead of thee and the
future of the empire is in thy hands

  and as he clattered off fill not thy
head with wonderings about the lightning

  i slept not at all that night but sat
till the dawn came thinking out a plan
of action by that time i was fairly con-
vinced that there was naught to be gained
by waiting waiting makes me impatient
as well i determined to act at once and
since one day is quite as good as the next
i decided that this day was to see the
thing begun

  i came before the emperor at noon and
received my decorations within the hour
i had made myself known to the four and
ninety men who were to be my command
a picked company all of a height and
weight with bodies that lacked little of
my own perfection never was there a
finer guard about the palace

  my first care was to pick a quarrel with
the outgoing commander twas easy
enough he was green with envy anyhow
and so it came about that we met about
mid afternoon with seconds in a well-
frequented field in the outskirts


famous fantastic mysteries

  before supper was eaten my entire troop
knew that their new captain had tossed
his ball-slinger away without using it had
taken twenty bails from their former com-
manders weapon and while thus wounded
had charged the man and despatched him
with bare hands needless to say this
exploit quite won their hearts none but
a blind man could have missed the re-
spect they showed me when all bandaged
and sore i lined them up next morning
afterward i learned that they had all
taken a pledge to follow strokor through
the gates of hofe itself

  twas but a week later that fully re-
covered and in perfect fettle i called my
men together one morn as the sun rose
by that time i had given them a sample
of my brains through ordering a rear-
rangement of their quarters such as made
the same much more comfortable also i
had dealt with one slight infraction of the
rules in such a drastic fashion that they
knew i would brook no trifling all told
tis hard to say whether they thought the
most of me or of jon

  men said i as bluntly as  knew
the emperor is an old man and as ye
know he is disposed to be lenient toward
the men of klow whereas ye and i well
know that the louts are blackguards

  now i will tell ye more it has come
to me lately that klow is plotting to at-
tack us with strange weapons of course
i have told the emperor of it yet he will
not act he says to wait till we are at-
tacked

  i stopped and watched their faces sure
enough the idea made them ache each
of these men was spoiling for a fight

  now tell me how would ye like to
become the emperors bodyguard i did
not have to wait long the light that
flared in their faces told me plainly and
-how would ye like to have me for your
emperor	

  at that their tongues were loosed and
i hindered them not they yelled for pure
joy and pressed about me like a pack of
children i saw that the time was ripe for
action

  up then i roared and led the way
we met the emperors guard on the lower
stairs and from that point on we fairly
hacked our way through

  well no need to describe that fight
for a time i thought we were gone the
guards had a cunningly devised labyrinth
on the second floor and attacked us from
holes in a false ceiling so that we suffered
heavily at first

  but i saw what was amiss and shouted
to my men to clear away the timbers
and after that it was clear work i lost
forty men before the guard was disposed
of the emperor i finished myself he
dodged right spryly for a time but at last
i caught him and tossed him to the foot
of the upper stairs and there he still lies
fqr none of my men would touch him nor
would i we covered him with quick-lime
and some earth

  then we all feasted on the emperors
store and soon were feeling like ourselves

  men i said impressively i am
proud of ye never did an emperor have
such a dangerous gang of bullies

  at that they all grinned happily and i
added and tis a fine staff of generals
that yell make

  need i say more those men would
have overturned the palace for me had
i said the word as it was they obeyed
my next orders in such a spirit that suc-
cess was assured from the first

  first using the dead emperors name
i caused the various chiefs to be brought
together at once to the court chamber
at the same time i contrived to prevent
any word of our action from getting
abroad so when the former staff faced
me the next morning they learned that
they were to be executed i could trust
not one they were all friends of the old
man

  with the chiefs out of the way and my
own men taking their commands the
whole army fell into my hands true
there were some insurrections here and
there but my men handled them with
such speed and harshness that any further
stubbornness turned to admiration by
the lord of death



this time the fame of strokor was spread
throughout the empire

  and thus it came about that within
a week of the night that old maka first
put the idea into my head strokor son
of strok reigned throughout vlamaland
and to make it complete the army cele-
brated my accession by taking a pledge
before jon

   to strokor the fittest of the fit

chapter iv

the assault

now out of a total population of per-
haps three million i had about a
quarter-million first-class fighters in my
half of the world klow by comparison
had but two-thirds the number his land
was not a rich one

   shortly my spies reported that his armo-
ries were devising a new type of weapon
twas a strange verification of my own
fiction to my men i could learn nothing
however about -t

  meanwhile i caused a vast number of
flat-boats to be built all in secret each
of them was intended for a single fighter
and his supplies and each was so ar-
ranged with side paddle wheels that it
could be driven by the motor in the sol-
diers chariot and thus give each his own
boat

  discarding all precedent i packed not
all my forces together as had been done
in the past but scattered them up and
down the coast fronting the land of klow
at a prearranged time my quarter-million
men set out a company in each tiny fleet
just as i had planned we all arrived at a
certain spot on klows coast at practi-
cally the same hour

  twas a brilliant stroke the enemy
looked not for a fleet of water-ants ready
to step right out of the sea into battle
their fleet was looking for us true but
not in that shape and we were all safely
ashore before they had ceased to scour the
seas for us	

  i immediately placed my heavy ma-
chines and just as all former expeditions

had done opened the assault at once with
a shower of the poison shells i relied it
will be seen upon the surprise of my at-
tack to strike terror into the hearts of the
louts

  but apparently they were prepared for
anything no matter how rapid the attack
my bombardment had not proceeded
many moments before to my dismay
some of their own shells began to fall
among us soon they were giving as good
as we

  i had placed maka in my cabinet as
soon as i had reached the throne

   the old man stroked his beard gravely
perchance it had been wrong to come
to the old landing they simply began
shelling it as a matter of course

  ye are right again i told him and
forthwith moved my pieces over into an-
other triangle previously of course all
my charioteers had gone on toward the
capital however i took care to move
my machines one at a time so that there
was no let-up in my bombardment

  but scarce had we taken up the new
position before the enemys shells likewise
shifted and began to strike once more in
our midst i swore a great oath and
whirled upon maka in wrath

  can ye explain this thing my men
have combed the land about us there
are none of the scouts secreted here and
even so they could not have notified klow
so soon besides tis pitch dark i was
sorely mystified

   all we could do was to fling our shells
as fast as our machines would work and
dodge the enemys hail as best we could
thus the time passed and it was near
dawn when the first messengers returned

   they have stopped us just outside the
walls of the city was the report it
pleased me that they should haye pushed
so far at first i climbed at once into my
chariot

   now is the time for strokor to strike
i gave orders for the staff to remain where
it was i will send ye word when the
city is mine

  but before i started my engine i


famous fantastic mysteries

glanced up at the sky to see if the dawn
were yet come and as i gazed i thought
i saw something come between me and a
star i brushed the hair away from my
eyes and looked again to my boundless
surprise i made out not one but three
strange objects moving about swiftly in
the air

  look i cried and my whole staff
craned their necks in a moment all had
seen and great was their wonder

  twas maka who spoke first they are
much too large to be creatures of jon
he muttered they must be some trick
of the enemy

  dost recall edams vision of the crea-
tures in the air of jeos he went on
knowing that i would not hinder him
now as i remember it he said they
flew with great speed were it not pos-
sible strokor for suitable engines to pro-
pel very light structures at such high
speed as to remain suspended in the air
after the manner of leaves in a storm
i note these strangers move quite fast

  it was even so and at that same in-
stant one of them swung directly above
our heads so close that i could hear the
hum of a powerful engine so it was only
a trick i shook myself together

  attention my staff drew up at the
word they are but few fear them not
we waste no more time here pack up
the machines and follow

  and thus we charged upon klow

  i found that my men had entirely sur-
rounded the city klows men were put-
ting up a plucky fight and showing no
signs of fearing us seeing this i blew a
blast on my engines whistle so that my
bullies might know that i had come

  immediately the word ran up and down
the line so that within a few minutes
klow was facing a roaring crowd of half-
mad terrors i myself set the example by
charging the nearest group of the enemy
they were mounted within the rather
small and perfectly circular chariots
which they preferred they were quick
and slippery but they could not stand
before a determined rush

  i ran them down and toppled them
over and dropped suffocation bombs into
their little cages with such vigor and dis-
regard of their volleys that my men could
not resist the example we charged all
along that vast circular line and we
cheered mightily when the whole front
broke turned tail and ran before us

but scarce had they got away before
a queer thing happened a flock of
those great air-creatures some eight alto-
gether rose up from the middle of the
city it was now fairly light and we could
see well they came out to the battleline
and began to circle the city

  as they did so they dropped odd mis-
shapen parcels totally unlike materials of
war but when they struck they gave off
prodigious puffs of a greenish smoke of
so terribly pungent a nature that my men
dropped before it like apples from a
shaken tree twas a fearful sight lucky
for us that the louts had had no practise
else few of us should be alive to tell the
tale

  and so they swept around the great cir-
cle many triangles in area and every-
where the unthinkable things smote the
hearts of my men with a fear they had
never known only one of the devices suf-
fered it was brought down by a chance
fling of a poison shell the rest after
loosing their burdens returned to the city
for more

  i am no fool i saw that we could do
nothing against such weapons

  return i commanded and instantly
my staff whistled the code the men
obeyed with alacrity making off at top
speed with the men of klow in hot pur-
suit although able to do little damage

  aye it was a sorrowful thing that re-
treat i was mainly angry that klow had
not showed himself

  by the time i- had reached the sea-
shore most of my men were in their
boats i stayed till the last although i
could see the enemys fleet bearing down
hard upon us from the north in truth we
would have all been lost had we come
the lord of death

- 

in the manner of former campaigns all
together in big transports but because
we could scatter every which way the
fleet harmed us little and four-fifths of
us got safely back

   happily none of the air-machines had
 range enough to reach vlamaland as soon
 as i could get my staff together i gave
 orders such as would insure discipline
 then reminding my hearties that klow
 knowing our helplessness would surely
 attack as soon as fully equipped i made
 this offer

   to the man who shall suggest the best
 way of meeting their attack i shall give
 the third of my empire

  so they knew that the case was des-
perate as for myself i slept not a bit
but paced my sleep-chamber and thought
deeply

  now a bit of a shell from an enemy
slinger had penetrated my arm till now

 i had paid no attention to it but it began
 to bother me so i pulled the metal from
 my arm with my teeth and quite by
 chance i placed the billet on the table
 within a few inches of the compass i had
 carried on my boat

   to my intense surprise the needle of the
 compass swung violently about so that
 one end pointed directly at the fragment
 of metal i moved them closer together
 there was no doubt that they were
 strongly attracted the enemys shells
 were made of mere iron

   the moment i fully realized this i saw
 clearly how we might baffle the men of
 klow i instantly summoned some men
 gave the orders much as though t had
 known for years what was to be done
 and in a few moments had the satisfaction
 of seeing my messengers hurrying north
 and south

 and so it came about that within three
 days of our shameful retreat a tenth of
 my men were at work on the new project
 as yet there was no word from my spies
 across the sea but we worked with all pos-
 sible haste and this very briefly iswhat
 we did

we laid a gigantic line of iron clear

across the empire from north to south
from snow to snow one end was bedded
in the island of pathna where the north
magnetic-pole is found while the other
stopped on the opposite side of the world
in a hole dug through the ice into the solid
earth of the south polar plain and every
foot of that enormous rod-twas as big
around as my leg-was insulated from the
ground with pieces of our secret non-mag-
netic alloy

  not for nothing had our chemists
sought the metal which would resist the
lightning and not for nothing did my
bullies piece the rod together all working
at the same time so that the whole thing
was complete in seven days that is com-
plete save for the final connecting link
and that lay a loglike roll of iron at the
door of my palace ready to be rolled into
place whenever i was ready

   and on the morrow klow reached our
shores

chapter v

the victory

my first intent was to let them ad-
vance unhampered but maka
pointed out that such a policy might give
them suspicions and so we disputed their
course all the way i gave orders to show
no great amount of resistance thus the
louts reached vlama in high feather
confident that the game was theirs

   i stood at the door of the palace as
klow himself rolled up to the edge of the
parade-ground my men obeying orders
had given way to him his crew swarmed
the space behind and on all sidesof him
while my own bullies were all about and
behind the palace never did two such
giant armies face one another in peace
for i had caused my banner to be floated
wrong end to in token of surrender

   first a small body of subordinates
waited upon me demanding that i give
up the throne i answered that i would
treat with none save klow himself and
shortly the knave surrounded by perhaps


famous fantastic mysteries

fifty underlings stepped up before me

  hail strokor he growled his voice
shaking a bit with excitement not with
fear for he were a brave man hail to
thee and to thine and a pleasant stay in
hofe for ye all

  hail klow replied i glancing up
meaningly at the air monsters wheeling
there i take it that ye purpose to exe-
cute us

  aye he growled savagely thou
didst attack without provocation thy life
is forfeit and as many more as may be
found needful to guarantee peace

  then i quoth my manner changing
then ye have saved me the trouble of
deciding what shall be thy fate execu-
tion say you so be it

  and i strode down to the great log of
iron which lay ready to fill the gap klow
looked at me with a peculiar expression
as though he thought me mad true it
looked it how could i do him harm with-
out myself suffering

  but i kicked the props which held the
iron and gave it a start with my foot the
ends of the pole-to-pole rod lay concealed
by brush perchance fifty yards away in
ten seconds that last section had rolled
completely between them and only a fool
would have missed seeing that the last
ten feet the iron was fair jerked through
the air

  as this happened we all heard a tre-
mendous crackling like that of near-by
lightning while enormous clouds of dust
arose from the two concealed ends which
were now become connections and at the
same time a loud steely click just one
and no more sounded from the intruding
host 

  for a moment klow was vastly puzzled
then he snarled angrily what means
this foolery strokor advance and give
us thy ax

  for answer i turned me about so as to
face my men and held up my hand in
signal instantly the whistles sounded and
my hearties came bounding into the field

  treachery shouted klow and his
officers ran here and there shouting to

arms charge and destroy no quarter

  but i paid little attention to the hub-
bubs i was gazing up at those infernal
creatures of the air and my heart sang
within me as i saw them circling errati-
cally but very surely down to the earth
and as they came nearer my satisfaction
was entire for their engines were silent

  at the same time consternation was
reigning among our visitors not a man of
all klows thousands was able to move his


car or lift a weapon every slinger was
jammed as though frozen by invisible ice
all their balls and shells were stuck to-
gether like the work of a transparent
glue even their side arms were locked in
their scabbards and all their tugging
could budge them not

  but none of my men were so handi-
capped each mans chariot was running
as though nothing had happened they
thundered forward discharging their balls
and shells as freely as they had across the
sea their charge was a murderous one
not a man of klows was able to resist
save with what force he could put into his
bare hands

  klow saw all this from the middle of
his group of officers none were able to
more than place his body twixt us and
their chief in a very few moments they
saw that the unknown magic had made
them as children in our hands they were
utterly lost and klow turned away from
the sight with a black face again he faced
me

  what means this ye huge bundle of
lies what mean ye by tricking us with
yon badge of surrender only to tie our
hands with thy magic of hofe is this the
way to fight like a man

  i had stood at ease in my door since
rolling the iron now i looked about me
still more easily my men were running
down the louts who had jumped from
their useless chariots and taken to their
heels twas but a matter of time before
the army of klow would be no more at
that rate

  klow i answered him mildly ye
are right this is not the way to fight like
the lord of death

- 

 a man neither i pointed out one of the
 fallen air-cars neither is that the way
 flitting over our heads like shadows and
 destroying us with filthy smoke shame
 on ye klow for stooping to such and
 upon thy own head be the blame for the
 trick i have played upon ye

  you attacked us without provoca-
tion he muttered sourly

   aye and for a very good reason i
replied yet i see thy view-point and
shalt give thee the benefit of the doubt

i turned to my whistlers and gave an
order so that presently the great slaugh-
ter had stopped my men and klows alike
struggled back to see what might be amiss

  i handed klow an ax throw away
thine own scabbard and all i told him
it is useless for tis made of iron ours
and all our tools ofwar are formed of
an alloy which is immune from the
magic

   he took the ax in wonderment what
means it strokor asked he again mean-
while stripping himself in a businesslike
fashion that was good to see

   it means said i throwing off my
robe that i have unchained the mag-
netism of this world know you klow
that all of the children of the sun are full
of his power it is like unto that of the
tiny magnet which ye give children for
to play but it is mighty even as our
world is mighty

 good jon he gasped for his was
not a daring mind what have ye done
ye trifler

   i have transformed this empire into
one vast magnet i answered coolly
then i showed him a boulder on the sum-
mit of a distant hill through the tube
klow could see some of my men standing
beside it

   place one of thy own men on the roof
 of the palace i told klow and give him
 orders to lower my banner should ye give
 him the word

for upon the outcome of this fight
twixt me and thee klow hinges the
whole affair if thou dost survivetownj
comes my banner then my men on the

 hill shall topple the boulder which shall
 rush down the slope and burst the iron
 rod and break the spell stand then and
 defend thyself

   and it did me good to see the spirit
fly into his eyes he saw that his empire
lived or died as he lived or died and he
fought as he had never fought before
small man that he was beside myself he
was wondrous quick and sure in his mo-
tions before i knew it he had bit his ax
deep into my side

  and in another moment or two it was
over for as soon as i felt the pain of
that gash i flung my own blade away
with a roar such as would have shaken a
stouter heart than his i charged the man

i took a second fearful blow full on my
chest and heeding it not at all i snatched
the ax from his hands then as he turned
to run i dropped that tool also

  and i ran him down and felled him
and broke his head with my hands

  an unfortunate accident of mr
smiths before he was thoroughly familiar
with the machine mutilated a large por-
tion of the tape so badly that it was
made worthless this explains why some-
thing appears to be missing from the ac-
count and why the next chapter begins
in the middle of a sentence

the fittest

slaves but the most were slain
neither could we bother with their
women and others left behind

  now by this time the empire was as
one man in its worship of me i had been
emperor but a year and already i had
made it certain that only the men of
vlamaland and no others should live in
the sight of jon so well thought they of
me i might fair have sat upon my reputa-
tion and have spent my last days in
feasting like the man before me

   but i was still too young and full of
energy to take my ease i found myself
more and more restless i had naught to
do now at last i sent for old maka


famous fantastic mysteries

  ye put me up to this ye old fraud
i told him pretending to be wrathful
now set me another task or ill have
thy head

  he knew me too well to be affrighted
he said that he had been considering my
case of late

  strokor thy father was right when he
told thee to have naught to do with
women that is to say he was right at the
time were he alive today he would of a
certainty say that it was high time for
thee to pick thy mate

  remember strokor great though
thou art yet when death taketh thee thy
greatness is become but a memory me-
thinks ye should leave something more
substantial behind

  it took but little thought to convince
me that maka was right once more as
soon as i thought upon it it was a woman
that i was restless for

  jon bless thee i told the old man
ye have named both the trouble and the
remedy i will attend to it at once the
best in the world shall be mine of course
but as for which one hast any notion
thyself

  aye he quoth  tis my own niece
i have in mind perchance ye remember
her a pretty child who was with me
when thou didst save my life up there on
the mountainside

  but she is not a vigorous woman
maka think you she is fit for me

  aye if any be he replied earnestly
ave is not robust true but her muscles
are as wires it is because of what lies in
her head however that i commend her
i have taught her all i know

  so i exclaimed much pleased
then she is indeed fit to be the empress
and as i recall her she was exceedingly
good to look at

  say no more ave shall be the wife of
strokor and so it was arranged

  there ye have the story of strokor the
mightiest man in the world and the wis-
est more than this i shall not tell with
my own lips i shall have singers recite
my deeds until half the compartments in

the house of words is filled with the rec-
ords thereof

  my ambition is fulfilled let the hand
of jon descend upon our world if it may
i care not if the sun comes nearer and
the water dry up and the days grow
longer and longer till the day and the
year become of the same length i care
not my people such as be left of them
shall own what there is and shall live as
long as life is possible

  i shall leave behind no race of weak-
lings every man shall be fit to live and
the fittest of them all shall live the longer
and he no matter how many cycles hence
shall look back to strokor and to ave his
wife and shall say

  i am what i am the last man on the
world because strokor was the fittest man
of his time

  aye my fame shall live as long as
there be life tonight as i speak these
things into the word machine my heart is
singing with the joy of it all thank jn
i was born a man not a woman

  tomorrow i go to fetch ave the more
i think of her the more i see that mine
whole life hath been devised for this one
moment i see that insignificant though
she be ave is a needed link in the chain

  here is the place to stop there is no
more i can say the story is done the
story of strokor the greatest man in the
whole world

chapter vii

the going

tlhs several years since last i faced
j- this machine many and many a day
since i said that my story was done and
placed the record on the shelf of my ante-
room my heart full of satisfaction and
today  must needs add another record
perhaps two to the pile

  when i set out for the highlands on the
morn following what i last related i took
with me but two or three men not that
i had any need for guards but because it
looketh not well for the emperor to travel
without retainers however few
the lord of death

- 

   i reached the locality as the sun went
down the sky was a brilliant color i
remember it well darkness would come
soon though not as quickly as farther
south commonly i think not upon such
trifles but i was nearing my love and
tender things came easily to my mind

   my chariot kept to the road which lay
alongside the irrigating flume a stone
trough which runs from the snow-covered
hills to the dry country below i had al-
ready noted this flume where it emptied
into the basin in the valley below lor it
had had a new kind of a spillway affixed
to it a broad smooth platform with a
slightly upward curve over which the
water was shooting i saw no sense in the
arrangement and made up my mind to
ask maka about it for the empire prized
this trough most highly it ran straight
and true over expensive bridges where
needed with scarce a bend to hold back
the flow

  when i stopped my car outside the
house i was surprised that none should
come out to greet me maka had sent word
of my coming all should have been in
readiness but i was forced to use my
whistle

  there was no stir i became angry i
told my bullies to stay where they were
and myself burst in the door

   the house was a sturdy stone affair of
one floor set against the side of the moun-
tain a short distance above the flume i
looked about the interior in surprise for
not a soul was in sight in any of the com-
partments there were signs that people
had been there but a few moments before
i called it strange for i had seen no one
leave the house as i approached

   at last as i was inspecting the eating
place i noted a small door let into the
outer wall it was open and by squeezing
i managed to get through i found that it
let into a long dark passage

   i followed this going steadily down a
flight of stairs and all of a sudden bumped
into an iron grating at the same moment
i saw that the passageway made ft turn
just beyond by craning my neck and

straining my eyes i could see a faintly
lighted chamber just a few feet away

  and before my eyes could scarce make
out the figures of some people in the mid-
dle of the place a voice came to my ear

  hail strokor it said and great was
my astonishment as i recognized the tones
of edam the young dreamer whom maka
had brought to my house

  edam i cried what do ye here
come and open these bars

  he made no reply save to laugh in a
way i did not like i shook the grating
savagely so that i felt it give edam

i roared open this grating at once and
tell me where is ave

   am here came another voice i
stopped in sheer surprise to peer closer
and to see for the first time that it was
really the dreamer and the chit these two
and no more who sat there in the under-
ground chamber they seemed to be sit-
ting in some sort of a box with glass
windows

  ave come here i spoke much more
gently than to edam for my heart was
soft with thoughts of her it is thy lord
strokor the emperor who calls thee
come 

   i stay here said she in the same clear
voice entirely unshaken by my presence
edam hath claimed me and i shall
cleave to him i want none of ye ye
giant

for a moment i was minded to throw
my weight against the barrier such
was my rage then i thought better on
it and closely examined the bars two
were loose

  ave said i contriving to keep my
voice even although my hands were busy
with the bars as i spoke ave-ye do
wrong to spite me thus know ye not that
 am the emperor and that these bars
cannot stand before me i warn ye if i
must call my men to help me and to wit-
ness my shame it will go hard with ye

up for the chit ye are wrong strokor
we defy thee to do thy worst we are pre-
pared to flee from ye at all costs

  i had twisted one of the bars out of my
way without their seeing it i strove at
the next as i answered still controlling
my voice  twill do ye no good to flee
edam ye know that and as for ave-
she shall wish she had never been born 
so i should she replied with spirit
if i were to become thy woman but
know you strokor that ave the daughter
of durok would rather die than take the
name of one who had spurned her as ye
did me

  so i had it had slipped my mind but
i want thee now ave said i softly pre-
paring to slip through the opening i had
made surely ye would not take thine
own life

  nay she answered with a laugh in
her voice rather i would go with edam
here i would go she finished her voice
rising in her excitement away from this
horrible worldaway from it all strokor
and to jeos hear ye to jeos and-
but at that instant i burst through the
grating without a sound i charged
straight for the pair of them

  and without a sound they slipped away
from my grasp next second i was gazing
stupidly at the rushing swirling water
of the flume

  and i saw that they had been sitting
in the cabin of a tiny boat and that they
had got away

  there was an opening into the outer
air i rushed through and stared in the
growing twilight down the black furrow
of the flume far in the distance and
going like a streak i spied the glittering
glass windows of the little craft once i
made out the flutter of a saucy hand

  we shall get them when they reach
the valley i shouted to the men then
i reached for my tube and sighted it on
the lower end of the flume far far below
almost too far away to be clear to the
naked eye

  in an incredibly short time the craft
reached the end it traveled at an extraor-

dinary rate perchance twas weighted i
marveled that its windows could stand the
force of the air and i scarce had time
to fear that the twain should be destroyed
on that upturned spillway before it was
there

  and then an awesome thing happened
as the boat struck the incline it shot up-
ward into the air at a steep slant up up
it went my heart jumped into my mouth
for surely they must be crushed when they
came down

  but the craft did not come down it
went on and on up and up its speed
scarcely slackened twas like that of a
shooting star and in far less time than it
takes to tell it the little boat was high
up among the stars going higher every
instant and farther away from me and
suddenly the sweat broke cold on my fore-
head for dead ahead directly in line
with their travel lay the bluish white
gleam of jeos

  so great was my rage over the escape
of the dreamer with my woman at first
i felt no sorrow later after days and
days of search in and about the basin i
came to grieve most terribly over my loss
when i came home to the palace i was
welltnigh ill

  in vain did i make the most generous
of rewards the whole empire turned out
to search for the missing ones but noth-
ing came of it all yet i never ceased to
hope especially after my talk with maka

  aye he said when i questioned him
it is barely possible that they have left
this world for all time i have calculated
the speed which their craft might have
attained had it the right proportions and
in truth it might have left the spillway
at such a speed that it entirely overcame
the draw of the ground

  but i think it was a slim chance it
is more than likely that ave shall return

  was i not the fitter man surely
edams purposes could not succeed jon
would not have it so the woman was
mine because i had chosen her and she
must come back to me and in safety or
i should tear edam into bits
the lord of death



  but as time went on and naught trans-
pired i became more and more melan-
choly

  life had become an empty thing it had
been empty enough before i had craved
the girl but now it was empty with hope-
lessness

  after a while i got to thinking of some
f the things maka had told me the more
i thought of the future the blacker it

eemed

  true there were many other fine women
nit there had been only one ave no
uch beauty had ever graced this world
before and i knew i could be happy with
no other

  now i saw that all my fame had been
in vain i had lost the only woman that
was fit for me and when i died there
would be naught left but my name even
that the next emperor might blot out if
he chose

  it had all been in vain

  it shall not be i roared to myself
s i strode about my compartment gnaw-
ing at my hands in my misery and in
just such a fit of helpless anger the great
idea came to me

  no sooner conceived than put into
practice i will not go closely into details

i will relate just the outstanding facts
what i did was to select a very tall moun-
tain located almost on the equator and
proclaimed my intention to erect a monu-
ment to jon upon its summit i caused
vast quantities of materials to be brought
to the place and for a year a hundred
thousand men labored to put the pieces
together

  when they had finished they had made
a mammoth tower partly of wood and
partly of alloy it was made in sections
so that it might be placed piece upon
piece one above another high into the
sky

  it was an enormous task when it was
complete i had a tower as high as the
moantain itself erected upon its summit

  and next i caused section after section
of the long iron pole-to-pole rod which
had tricked klow to be hauled up into

the tower i was only careful to begin the
process from the top and work downward
i gave word that the last three sections
be inserted at midday on a given day

  and at that hour i was safe inside a
non-magnetic room

  i know right well when the deed was
done there was a most terrific earth-
quake all about me though i could see
nothing at all i could hear buildings
falling the din was appalling

  at the same time the air was fairly
shattered with the rattle of the lightning
never have i heard the like before the
rod had loosed the wrath of the forces
above our air

  and as suddenly the whole deafening
storm ended perchance the rod was de-
stroyed by the lightning i never went
to see for i know the electricity split
the very ground apart but i gazed out
of a window in the top of my palace and
saw that i had succeeded

  not a soul but myself remained alive

  none but buildings made of the alloy
were standing not only man but most
of his works had perished in that awful
blast i alone remained

  i strokor am the survivor  i the
greatest man it was but fit that i should
be the last no man shall come after me
to honor me or not as he chooses i and
no other shall be the last man

  and when ave returns-as she must
though it be ages hence-when she comes
she shall find me waiting i strokor the
mighty and wise shall be here when she
returns i shall wait for her forever here
i shall always stay

  the stars may move from their places
but i shall not go

  for it is my intention to make use of
another secret that maka taught me in
brief-

  the record ends here it may be that
strokor left the machine for some trivial
reason and forgot to finish the story at
all events it is necessary to refer to the
further discoveries of the expedition in
order to learn and understand the outcome
of it all

the survivor

provided with a sledge-hammer a
crowbar and a hydraulic jack and
even with drills and explosives as a last
resort jackson kinney and van emmon
returned the same day to the walled-in
room in the top of that mystifying man-
sion the materials they carried would
have made considerable of a load had not
smith removed enough of the weights from
their suits to offset their burden they
reached the unopened door without spe-
cial exertion and with no mishap

  they looked in vain for a crack big
enough to hold the point of the crowbar
neither could the most vigorous jabbing
loosen any of the material they dropped
that tool and tried the sledge it gpt no
results even in the hands of the husky
geologist the most vigorous blows failed
to budge the door they did not even
dent it

  so they propped the powerful hydraulic
jack a tool sturdy enough to lift a house
at an angle against the door then using
the crowbar as a lever the architect
steadily turned up the screw the mechan-
ism multiplying his very ordinary strength
a hundredfold in a moment it could be
seen that he was getting results the door
began to stir van emmon struck one
edge with the sledge-hammer and it gave
slightly

  in another minute the whole door
weighing over a ton had been pushed al-
most out of its opening the jack over-
balanced toppled over they did not re-
adjust it but threw their combined weight
upon the barrier

  there was no need to try again with
a shiver the huge slab of metal slid up-
right into the space beyond stood straight
on end for a second or so then toppled
to the floor

  and this time they heard the crash

  for as the door fell a great gust of
wind rushed out with a hissing shriek

almost overbalancing the men from the
earth they stood still for a while breath-
ing hard from their exertion trying in
vain to peer into the blackness before
them under no circumstances would
either of them have admitted that he was
gathering courage

  in a minute the architect his eyes
sparkling with his enthusiasm for the
antique picked up the electric torch and
turned it into the compartment as he did
so the other two stepped to his side so
that the three of them faced the unknown
together it was just as well outlined in
that circle of light and not six feet in
front of them stood a great chair upon
a wide platform and seated in the chair
erect and alert his wide open eyes star-
ing straight into those of the three was
the frightful mountainous form of
strokor the giant himself

  for an indeterminable length of time
the men from the earth stood there
speechless unbreathing staring at that
awful monster as though at a nightmare
he did not move he was entirely at ease
and yet plainly on guard glaring at them
with an air of conscious superiority which
held them powerless instinctively they
knew that the all-dominating voice in the
records had belonged to this hercules
but their instinct could not tell them
whether the man still lived

  it was the doctors brain that worked
first automatically from a lifelong habit
of diagnosis he inspected that dreadful
figure quite as though it had been that
of a patient bit by bit his subconscious
mind pieced together the evidence the
man in the chair showed no signs of life
and after a while the doctors conscious
mind also knew

   he is dead he said positively in his
natural voice and such was the vast re-
lief of the other two that they were in
no way startled by the sound instantly
the lord of death

all three drew long breaths the tension
was relaxed and van emmons curiosity
found a harsh and unsteady voice

  how under heaven has he been pre-
served all this time especially he
added remembering considering the air
that we found in the room

  the doctor answered after a moment
his reply taking the form of advancing a
step or two and holding out a hand it
touched glass

  for the first time since the discovery
the builder shifted the light he had held
it as still as death for a full minute now
he flashed it all about the place and they
saw that the huge figure was entirely en-
cased in glass the cabinet measured
about six feet on each of its sides and
about five feet in height but such were
the squat proportions of the occupant
that he filled the whole space

  a slight examination showed that the
case was not fixed to the platform but
had a separate bottom upon which the
stumplike chair was set also they found

 

that thanks to the reduced pull of the
planet it was not hard for the three of
them to lift the cabinet bodily despite the
weight of almost a thousand pounds they
let the tools lie there discarded as much
weight as they could and proceeded to
carry that ages-old superman out into the
light

  here they could see from an examina-
tion of his mammoth cranium and extraor-
dinary expression that he was as highly
developed as the greatest men on earth
it was the back of his head however so
flat that it was only a continuation of his
neck or rather shoulders that told where
the flaw lay that together with the hard-
ness of his eyes the cruelty of his mouth
and the absolute lack of softness anywhere
in the ironlike face or frame all this con-
demned the monster as inhuman

  it was not easy to get him down the
two flights of stairs more than once they
had to prop the case on a step while they
rested and at one time just before they
reached that curious heap of rubbish at

the foot of the upper stairs jacksons
strength gave way and it looked as though
the whole thing would get away from
them

  once at the bottom of the lower flight
the rest was easy within a very few
minutes the astonished face of the engineer
was peering into the vestibule he could
hardly wait until the airtight door was
locked before opening the inner valves
he stared at the mammoth figure in the
case long and hard and from then on
showed a great deal of respect for his
three friends

  of course at that time the members of
the expedition did not understand the
conditions of mercury as they are now
known they had to depend upon the
general impression they got from their
first-hand investigations and it is re-
markable that the doctor should have
guessed so close to the truth

  he must have made up his mind to
outlast everybody else was the way he
put it as he kicked off his suit he stepped
up to the cabinet and felt of the glass
i wish it were possible without break-
ing the case to see how he was em-
balmed

  his fingers still rested on the glass
suddenly his eyes narrowed he ran his
fingers over the entire surface of the pane

  thats mighty curious he ejaculated
this thing was bitter cold when we
brought it in now its already as warm
as this car

  smiths eyes lit up it may be he of-
fered that the case doesnt contain a
vacuum but some gas which has an elec-
trical affinity for our atmosphere

  or exclaimed the geologist suddenly
the glass itself may be totally different
from ours it may be made of-

  good heavens shouted the doctor
jerking his hand from the cabinet and
leaping straight backward at the same
instant with a grinding crash all three
sides of the case collapsed and fell in
splinters to the floor

  look out shrieked jackson he was
staring straight into the now unhooded

eyes of the giant he backed away
stumbled against a stool and fell to the
floor in a dead faint smith fumbled im-
potently with a hammer the doctor was
shaking like a leaf

  but van emmon stood still in his
tracks his eyes fixed on the goliath his
fingernails gashed the palms of his hands
but he would not budge and as he stared
he saw from first to last the whole
ghastly change that came after billions
of years of waiting to the sole survivor
of mercury

  a glaze swept over the huge figure next
instant every line in that adamant figure
lost its strength the hardness left the
eyes and mouth the head seemed to sink
lower into the massive shoulders and the
irresistible hands relaxed in another sec-
ond the thing that had once been as iron
had become as rubber

  but only for an instant second by sec-
ond that huge mountain of muscle slipped
and jellied and actually melted before
the eyes of the humans at the same time
a curious acrid odor arose smith fell to
coughing the doctor turned on more
oxygen

in less than half a minute the man
who had once conquered a planet was
reduced to a steaming mound of brownish
paste as it sank to the floor of the case
it touched a layer of coarse yellow powder
sprinkled there and it was this that
caused the vapor in a moment the room
was filled with the haze of it

  and thus it came about that within
five minutes from being exposed to the
air of the sky-car that whole immense
bulk chair and all had vanished the
powder had turned it to vapor and the
purifying chemicals had sucked it up
nothing was left save a heap of smoking
grayish ashes in the center of the broken
glass

  van emmons fingers relaxed their grip
he stirred to action turned to smith

  here help me with this thing

  between them they got the remains of
the cabinet with its gruesome load into

there had never been any question
of careys seamanship officers who
knew had testified to that the cap-
tain himself had declared so to the court
and he had added further the unsolicited
opinion that he knew no officer he would
more fully trust to keep safe position
when the destroyer division was making
twenty-five knots in close column

  furtive glances flickered between the
officers grouped about the green baized
wardroom table a disagreeable duty this
trying a brother at arms the judge advo-
cate himself hesitated then pushing
aside a thought not entirely complimen-
tary to naval regulations he sighed almost
audibly and put another question

  captain kennart shook his head with
grim decision

  no he said emphatically carey
never used the stadimeter always judged
the distance with his naked eye

  a member of the court cleared his
throat another tapped the table top with
his pencil the judge advocate sighed
within himself again

  thats all he said finally

  careys counsel nodded the president
of the court looked inquiringly at his con-
freres each shook his head in turn

  the president made the routine admo-
nition regarding silence and captain ken-
nart left the room

  lieutenant junior grade warren carey
relaxed somewhat in his seat he had felt
that his captain would do his best by
him he thrilled with a growing faith in
his fellow man at this positive evidence
that despite what had occurred the cap-
tain bore no grudge yet had captain

kennart given testimony inspired by an
active hate he could have found no fault

  hope again grew in his breast these
officers about him too he had shopped
and partied with all over the china coast
the admiral had ordered them on this
court a regulation duty they were to
ascertain facts impartially weigh them
give judgment in accordance with navy
law this they would do carey knew
yet when ones fate is to be settled by
real men mercy ever tempers justice real
men can understand

  a fluttering breath escaped carey nev-
ertheless

  he dared not succumb to optimism
between him and these others all other
men indeed he still sensed something in-
explicable as if he were befogged in vibra-
tions of a different plane he could not
see this clouding envelope it was a thing
to be felt but not by a normal percep-
tive faculty he wondered if he really dif-
fered in any strange way from ordinary
men it appeared almost that he did

  he shuddered slightly in recollection
of that night on the lower yangtze when
he and only he had seen those lights
every man who had been on the bridge
when the thing had occurred had sworn
to having seen not a single light he
carey witness at the captains own trial
had been alone in the affirmative he had
not been told this of course yet instinc-
tively he knew it must be so that night
they had declared themselves before the
court they assuredly had done the same
thing

  another witness was summoned

  through the haze of strange introspec-
tion carey heard fragments of his testi-
mony

  to think that this companion of many
an upper yangtze rice-bird hunt this doc-
tor who had brought him through the
dengue fever down in cavite should now
have to vouch for him in a general court
to think-could something about him
really be different from other men was
he-gifted why had it been given to him
and him only to see what had been with-
held from the sight of all other men on
the ship-those lights or was he prone
to temporary hallucination such as his
captain pityingly had hinted in an en-
deavor to extenuate his-careys-crime
and was the medico now-

   no the doctors voice rose i have
fished hunted shopped seen the sights
with carey and doctored him for the
last year and a half he is not insane
careys heart leaped in gratitude at the
mans vehement assertion the medico
too was a man

  but-insane

  surely the court had understood the
captains hint not by any possible chance
could they bring that dread judgment of
his case never

   and yet-he and only he had been the
man to see and then that trouble with
the captain carey shook his head surely
he had not been even temporarily mad
persons laboring under mental delusions
promptly forgot he had heard the vaga-
ries of their period of aberration and too
clearly could he still recall those lights
still envision that horrid struggle on the
destroyers bridge from the first order
he had given the man at the wheel every
incident was indelibly impressed on his
memory and with a clarity not to be con-
futed even to the final catastrophe and
the terror inspired by the crew no no
the medico was quite right he carey
was not insane

   yet somehow he was the only one

   dimly the doctors voice drifted again
through the cloud

  no sir he was answering the judge
advocates question i tested careys eyes
when he went up for full lieutenant just
before we sailed from the philippines

 they were perfect then and i examined
 them yesterday again his eyes are per-
 fect now

   carey quivered slightly if it wasnt his
 eyes what could it be

   the captain had declared that he was
 a trustworthy seaman the medico swore
 that he was neither insane nor visually
 defective then what he had seen

   and ever since the thing had occurred
 he had been in this daze he could not
 understand

 the judge advocate put another ques-
 lion

  the doctor answered with promptness
 and certitude

   yes i have heard of such cases they
 are not of uncommon occurrence i have
 heard them discussed in many a ward-
 room last spring when the division was
 proceeding from manila to lingayen gulf
 for torpedo practice there happened an
 instance of it i was on the flagboat lead-
 ing the column it was during the first
 watch i was on the bridge and the cap-
 tain and navigator were there with the
 officer of the deck

  we had just rounded cape bolinao
 and expected to pick up the light across
 the gulf we were all peering dead ahead
 -theres always a little rivalry to sight
 a light first the division commander or-
 dered one-third speed until we got a bear-
 ing on that light then he was going to
 turn column right and go down the gulf
 and anchor off dagupan

  for half an hour every man on the
 bridge gazed straight ahead and strained
 to see the light we knew must show up
 suddenly one of the men on the lookout
 sang out that he saw it he pointed almost
 due west about a point on the port bow
 we all strove to make it out the lookout
 insisted it was there then one after an-
 other we saw it it was an occulting light
 and we could even discern its pulsations
 and check its rate the column swung
 south at standard speed

  ten minutes later we had to change
 course several degrees to westward to avoid


famous fantastic mysteries

 going on the beach the next day we re-
 ceived a radio to the effect that that light
 had not been in order for two nights yet
 we had seen it we had expected it to be
 there and our straining eyes had actually
 envisioned the thing its a common
 enough occurrence as i said before the
 eye often sees what we want it to see

  the members of the court nodded un-
derstand ngly the judge advocate made a
pertinent query

  is it really the eye that sees this spec-
ter of a light that doesnt exist

  the doctor shook his head

  i would say not he answered slowly
in my estimation it is not the eye that
sees it at all its the brain behind the
eye the brain knows that the light ought
to be seen and deludes itself into the be-
lief that it actually does see it no its
the brain in such a case rather than the
eye

  but in the defendants case came
the logical question there was no such
expectation how do you account for
that

  the doctor shrugged his shoulders
carey moved uneasily in his chair

  that was the very question that had
troubled him ever since that night a week
ago he had not expected to see the things
that so clearly impressed themselves on
his vision he had not even been thinking
about such a thing the lower reaches of
the yangtze had few enough lights and
sparse were ships that ran the river at
night his own destroyer had attempted
it solely because ordered down from che-
foo for emergency missionary protection
upstream for above hankow was a local
uprising led by a taoist priesthood the
river gunboats were five hundred miles
farther up stream and turtle slow the
destroyer though north in pechili gulf
could reach the threatened area first so
they had entered the rivers upper channel
at night 

  no he had not expected to see a thing
and yet of the half dozen men on the
bridge he had and only he the medico
had just stated that such hallucination

was of the brain rather than the eye
could it have been his brain-his alone
thefog closed in upon carey again he
found it hard to think

  in the defendants case he felt more
than heard the doctor say i find no
precedent i can simply testify that he is
a steady man entirely sane and has per-
fect eyesight and yet i do believe that
he was dead certain that he saw those
lights and as certain too that the others
did not what he saw must have been a
delusion of the mind yet of a mind that
was normal such things also do occur
yet his eyes are perfect and he is as bal-
anced mentally as any officer here

  careys hands bit into each other

  his captain was for him and now the

  and yet-and yet what could the
court do he had committed a crime for
which in olden days he might have hanged
and his excuse for the offense was what
simply that he had seen something that
no other man had seen the mere fact
that the catastrophe he saw coming over-
whelmed them on the very heels of the
captains interference could have but little
weight with a court that must decide his
fate on tangible fact

  and yet-good heaven it must be ex-
cuse enough he had seen the lights the
captain had interfered disaster had fol-
lowed it would not have closed upon them
had the captain let him alone surely the
court must understand that he had ex-
plained it all so carefully in minutest de-
tail when his counsel had put him on the
stand as witness in his own behalf

  the doctor was dismissed the court
was cleared

carey had the freedom of the ship
for a moment he felt that the fresh
breeze sweeping from the rice paddies of
the lower whampoo and the yangtze be-
yond would clear his head and give a little
friendly stimulation then he recalled that
other officers would be topside friends
they all were indeed but carey did not

desire brotherly companionship just now
nor did he care to feel the pitying glances
of old shipmates he wanted to be alone
to think to go over again the events of
the past week of that night he turned
down the passageway to the stateroom as-
signed him since the disaster now that
he was away from the atmosphere of the
court he already felt better

  the doctor had said that his eyes were
normal he had also declared that his
brain was as rational as that of any officer
on the court-a fine thing and a daring
one for a destroyer medical officer to say
he must have meant it must have wanted
to strongly impress the court with his ear-
nestness and his belief carey drew a
breath of relief

  good eyes good mind the chill fog
that in fear for the latter had penetrated
his very being gradually began to dissi-
pate

  how clearly it all came back

  he had been officer of the deck the
captain had snatched a hasty meal from
the food brought up by his filipino boy
to the emergency cabin on the bridge
the navigator had plotted changes of
course and was below finishing off his
coffee with the other officers

  a half hour remained of the second dog
watch carey had been going over some
points he wished to impress upon the
chief boatswains mate when he took the
eight oclock reports a tear in the awn-
ing canvas where it stretched tight over
the freezing apparatus on top of the ice
locker just abaft the bridge was one of
these

  the awning was beginning to flap and
this night carey demanded silence on the
bridge he could sense better then any
variation in the hum of the forced draft
blowers and in the currents of the lower
yangtze all things must be anticipated
the officer of the deck must know as soon
as the fire-room watch that something was
going wrong must have the focsle gang
ready to let go the anchor even before
word of the lost steam came through the
voice tube

  he stood on the starboard side of the
bridge near the rack of tubes leaning on
the sill of the open port fleet sparks from
the captains pipe indicated his almost
identical position near the engine room
telegraphs to port carey was almost
tempted to call the boatswains mate at
once to have that awning repaired he
had all but turned to give the order when
his eye caught something yet dim in the
distance

  for a minute or more he gazed steadily
at the object then from where they were
hanging on one of the searchlight direct-
ing wheels on the bulkhead of the emer-
gency cabin he took up his binoculars
faintly through the glass he could make
out that there were three lights instead
of one

  he softly called the starboard lookout
do you see any lights about three points
on the bow he asked pretty far off

  the lookout stared into the blackness
of the night blinking as the damp breeze
bedewed his eyelashes then he shook his
head no sir

  try the glass carey suggested

  the lad shook his head as before

  dont see a thing sir

  certain of it demanded carey

  absolutely sir was the answer

carey remembered all this with ex-
treme clearness-every detail lying
on the bunk in his stateroom he found
himself living over again that fifteen-
minute period in which so much had hap-
pened

  he had taken the binoculars from the
lookout and ordered him back to his post
then he glanced at the clock on the emer-
gency cabin bulkhead just behind the man
at the wheel this was a matter of habit
there was nothing to record he had not
expected to see any lights anyway and
the flapping of the canvas over the ice
locker did not disconcert him now it had
become part of the normal respiration of
the ship and carey decided that he would
not disturb the boatswains mate about it
until the eight oclock reports


famous fantastic mysteries

  he turned back to his open port but
discovered the captain staring out into the
blackness charging his pipe with one of
the patent fillers he had bought from the
greek in chefoo he paused tentatively at
his elbow undecided whether to stay there
or assume the captains former position
near the annunciators

  then something urged him to remain
the captain acknowledged his presence
with a grunt

  did you see something

  carey nodded rather hesitantly
thought i did sir looked to me like
a ships light off to starboard

  the captain lifted his binoculars and
focused them in the direction carey had
indicated the latter raised his own glass
he recalled that he gave an exclamation
of surprise

  the lights are there sir all right
seem nearer now too

  humph i dont make anything out
grunted the captain

  carey stepped back of him and leveled
an arm over his shoulder with the edge
of his hand up as in aiming

  about two points on the bow sir left
a trifle captain there-thats it see
them now sir

  intently the captain gazed slowly
changing focus with his forefinger on the
adjusting wheel then he dropped the
glass

  dont see a thing carey

  he bent to gain the protection of the
bulkhead and a match scratched then
glowed over his pipe

  thats funny carey answered some-
what mystified

  he wondered if perhaps his last look
at the light-flooded chart had left dancing
gleams on the retina of his eye he care-
fully wiped his eyes with his handkerchief
and cleaned the binoculars with a bit of
lens paper then raised them again-and
started

  but the lights are close now captain
he lowered his glass slightly why i can
see them with my naked eye right there
sir he leveled his arm again

  hanged if i can see em carey but
this river breeze blurs everything lets
try jfcur glass

  carey ducked from under the leather
strap and handed the binoculars over the
captain rapidly found focus then shook
his head again

  not a thing not a thing better have
your eyes examined young fellow

  but theyre holding steady captain
carey expostulated a ship as clear as
day heading from starboard across our
course i can see her masthead and port
running light and cabin lights topside
suddenly he swung to the wheelsman
whats your compass

  right on sir two forty-eight
come on two sixty carey ordered
whats that demanded the captain
get the time of that change quarter-
master snapped carey then in answer
to the captain shifting course a bit to
right sir shes got the right of way and
theres no use taking any chances
whos got the right of way the cap-
tain demanded again

  that ship sir-

  dammit carey your eyes must have
gone bad theres no ship in sight

  but captain kennart-

  the captain turned sharply to the
wheelsman

  back on your former course to the
quartermaster get that time he swung
back to the open port and snapped for
the lookouts sensing something unusual
in the very atmosphere the whole bridge
force was now tensely on the alert do
you lads see anything ahead-lights

  all hands intently stared out into the
blackness of the night

  their opinion was unanimous not a
thing sir

  carey gave a cry of alarm captain
he turned savagely on the man at the
wheel fifteen degrees right on the
jump now

  the captains suddenly livid face glared
in the glow of the binnacle light

  dammit sir get off the bridge he
cried peremptorily to the wheelsman
lights



back to your former course snap into
it youre taking your orders from me
now lively

   carey recalled how the men had looked
 at each other in consternation he recalled
 his own utter dismay for the first time
 in his career he was ordered off the bridge
 that ship-lights looming up now not a
 cable length away holding steadily on
 the same angle-collision sure and he
 officer of the deck when the life of his
 ship was a matter of seconds and every
 one blind but him ordered below good
 heaven  it meant shipwreck the captain
 was bound for destruction mad he re-
 solved on one last frantic appeal

   but great god captain-its on our
very bows well hit sure well-

  the captain turned on him with an
oath then as carey stood his ground the
captains face became hard and grim a
deadly implication chilled in the ice-level
tone his voice held

   mr carey consider yourself under
arrest youre either mutinous or mad
this will be reported when we finish the
business up river and return to shanghai
get out

   the lights were within a hundred yards
 carey saw he was ordered off in dis-
 grace the captain was mad himself the
 whole bridge force had gone mad that
 ship-

   his answer was literally forced from
him by heaven sir i will not leave
he cried in utter desperation

   and he leaped to the annunciators and
 jerked the signals for both engines to full
 reverse then jumped for the steering
 gear shoved the man aside and madly
 spun the wheel to starboard

   with an oath the captain seized him
cried to the lookout to drag him below
a struggle ensued the ship throbbed as
the power of thirty thousand horses strove
to stop its forward rush carey remem-
bered the cloud of horror and impotence
that almost overcame him his one
thought was for the ship and of the ves-
sel even now across their knifelike stem

   he recalled his last hopeless words for-

getful of naval discipline and the men
about

  the lights too late too late cap-
tain you damn fool-

  and then the crash had come

iii

lying in the bunk the racking shock
of it was a physical blow again
carey recalled sickeningly his own release
-too late the startled outcries of the
men the intermittent raucous honking of
the general alarm some one had retained
command enough to switch on from the
bridge the shrill piping of the boatswains
mate his bellowing roar of all hands
abandon ship

  and then the sirens scream

  his station in such an emergency was
in charge of no  life raft later he found
himself clinging to this bobbing float
mind and body benumbed by the whisper-
ing waves of the swirling yangtze

  rescue court martial

  the captain for the loss of his ship he
himself for mutinous insubordination

  and yet-he had seen those lights

  a fog gathered about him again

iv

pulsations beat upon his brain
dimly he recognized them as rapid
footsteps in the passageway outside his
room he aroused somewhat as his door
was flung open and a shipmate burst in
upon him blinking he noted that the
newcomer was excited to an extreme

  news by thunder news for you war-
ren  the admiral says hes going to quash
every court martial that came out of the
wreck news from the divers down the
river just came up and set him all in a
daze hes pacing the deck now we did
not hit an uncharted rock last week war-
ren we tore our bottom out on the hulk
of the kew li whose boilers blew up
and only two men left to tell the tale
and what gets the admiral warren is
that you swore you saw those lights on
the night of the wreck but the kew li
went down four months ago

by a merritt

                  author of the metal monster the face in the abyss etc

           dr goodwin presses further into the labyrinth of the
           moon pool to discover a fantastic subterranean empire

     part ii	chapter vii

what happened before

  following the strange and inexplicable
disappearance of mr david throckmartins
wife his associate dr stanton and his
wifes maid thora hejverson in the un-
canny depths of the moon pool throck-
martin implored dr walter t goodwin to
rescue them short after he saw throck-
martin himself snatched from the deck of
their ship by a weird entity of living light-
the dread dweller of the moon pool

  determined to rescue the four victims
goodwin sails to the island of nan-matal
where lies the entrance to the cavern of the
moon pool

  while proceeding toward the island of
nan-matal and the cavern in which was
the moon pool in the little sailing vessel
sutvarna on the way he rescued olaf iluld-
ricksson from an abandoned vessel olaf
told them that a sparkling devil had come
down the path of the moon and taken his
wife and his little daughter

  on learning dr goodwins mission olaf
consented to join him with larry okeefe
of the royal air force whom they picked
up from his wrecked hydroplane the next
day they landed on nan-matal

  the full of the moon was past but by
means of light condensers dr goodwin
managed to focus the moon rays in suffi-
cient strength to cause the rock door to
the moon pool to open scarcely had it
done so when olaf shrieking rushed
through the portal a rifle cracked the
next moment a figure catapulated out of
the shadows and in a second okeefe and
the stranger were struggling on the thresh-
old of the moon door

  they rolled past the opened slab dr
goodwin following

  the great rock door swung to and they
found themselves imprisoned in the lair of
the dweller

the moon pool

tarry i cried turning to okeefe
       the stone has shut were
       caught

  okeefe took a brisk step toward the
barrier behind us there was no mark of
juncture with the shining walls the slab
fitted into the sides as closely as a mosaic

  its shut all right said larry but if
theres a way in theres a way out any-
way doc were right in the pew weve
been heading for so why worry he grin-
ned at me cheerfully and although i could
not accept his light-hearted view of the
situation i felt a twinge of shame for my
momentary panic t-he man on the floor
groaned and okeefe dropped swiftly to
his knees beside him

  von hetzdorp he said

  at my exclamation he moved aside
turning the face so i could see it it was
clearly german and just as clearly its
possessor was a man of considerable force
and intellectuality

  the strong massive brow with orbital
ridge unusually developed the dominant
high-bridged nose the straight lips with
their more than suggestion of latent
cruelty and the strong lines of the jaw
beneath a black pointed beard all gave
evidence that here was a personality be-
yond the ordinary the hair was closely
cropped on the square head and the short
stocky body with its deep chest and ab-
normal length of torso as compared to the

copyrighted  by the frank a munecy co

legs indicated extraordinary vitality

  unscrupulous i thought looking down
upon him remorseless crafty and with a
brain as unmoral as is science itself

  couldnt be anybody else said larry
he must have been watching us over
there from chau-ta-leurs vault all the
time when he saw that we had the slab
open i suppose he figured that now we had
picked the chestnuts out of the fire hed
better collect em all for himself so he
took a pot shot at me first and meant to
get you and olaf next but his aim was bad
-too good rather-and when he saw what

hed done he took a crazy chance

  the man on the corridors floor stirred
and swiftly okeefe ran practised hands
over his body then stood erect holding
out to me two wicked-looking magazine
pistols and a knife he got one of my
bullets through his right forearm too he
said just a flesh wound but it made him
drop his rifle some arsenal our little ger-
man scientist what

  i opened my medical kit and knelt be-
side von hetzdorp-if indeed it was he
the wound was a slight one and larry
stood looking on as i bandaged it

golden-eyed lakla stood looking
down at the sleeping larry and
all about her were other eyes  




famous fantastic mysteries

  got another one of those condensers
the heinie here broke he asked me sud-
denly and do you suppose olaf will know
enough to use it

  and then it dawned upon me that
okeefe could not have heard as i had the
norseman race into the moon doors pas-
sage before the door had closed i arose
swiftly

  larry i answered olafs not out-
side hes in here somewhere

  his jaw dropped

  didnt you hear him shriek when the
stone opened i asked

  i heard him yell yes he said but i
didnt know what was the matter and then
this wildcat jumped me- he paused and
his eyes widened which way did he go
he asked swiftly i pointed down the
faintly glowing passage

  theres only one way i said

  watch that bird close hissed okeefe
pointing to von hetzdorp-and pistol in
hand stretched his long legs and raced
away i looked down at the german his
eyes were open and he reached out a hand
to me i lifted him to his feet

  i have heard he said we follow
quick if you will take my arm please i
am shaken yet yes- i gripped his shoul-
der without a word and the two of us set
off down the corridor after larry von
hetzdorp was gasping and his weight pres-
sed upon me heavily but he moved with
all the will and strength that was in him

as we ran i took hasty note of the
tunnel i saw that its sides were
smooth and polished and that the light
seemed to come not from their surfaces
but from far within them-giving to the
walls an illusive aspect of distance and
depth rendering them spacious in a pecul-
iarly weird way the passage turned
twisted ran down turned again it came
to me that the light that illumined the
tunnel was given out by tiny points deep
within the stone sprang from the points
ripplingly and spread upon their polished
faces involuntarily i stopped to look more
closely

  hurry gasped von hetzdorp ex-
plain that later-etheric vibration-set up
in frat composition-stones really etheric
lights-stupendous hurry

  through his panting speech broke a
cry from far ahead it was larrys voice

  olaf

  i gripped von hetzdorps arm closer and
we sped on now we were coming fast to
the end of the passage before us was a
high arch and through it i glimpsed a dim
shifting luminosity as of mist filled with
rainbows we reached the portal and i
drew myself up short almost tripping the
german for what i was looking into was
a chamber that might have been trans-
ported from that enchanted palace of the
jinn king that rises beyond the magic
mountains of kaf

  it was filled with a shimmering pris-
matic lambency that thickened in the dis-
tances to impenetrable veils of fairy opales-
cence it was a shrine of sorcery

  before me stood okeefe and a dozen
feet in front of him huldricksson with
something clasped tightly in his arms the
norsemans feet were at the verge of a
shining silvery lip of stone within whose
oval lay a blue pool and down upon this
pool staring upward like a gigantic eye
fell seven pillars of fantom light-one of
them amethyst one- of rose another of
white a fourth of blue and three of
emerald of silver and of amber they fell
each upon the azure surface and i knew
that these were the seven streams of radi-
ance within which the dweller took shape
-now but pale ghosts of their brilliancy
when the full energy of the moon stream
raced through them

  then huldricksson bent and placed on
the shining silver lip of the pool that which
he held and i saw that it was the body of
a child he set it there so gently bent
over the side and thrust a hand down into
the water and as he did so he stiffened
strangely moaned and lurched against the
little body that lay before him instantly
the form moved and slipped over the verge
into the blue rigid with horror i w atched
huldricksson recover himself and throw
the conquest of the moon pool



his body over the stone hands clutching
arms thrust deep down and then i heard
from his lips a long-drawn heart-shriveling
cry of pain and of anguish that held in it
nothing human

  close on its wake came a cry from von
hetzdorp

  gotti shrieked the german drag
him back quick

  he leaped forward but before he could
half clear the distance okeefe had leaped
too had caught the norseman by the
shoulders and toppled him backward
where he lay whimpering and sobbing
and as i rushed behind the german i saw
larry lean over the lip of the pool and
cover his eyes with a shaking hand saw
von hetzdorp peer down into it with real
pity in his cold eyes heard him murmur
das armes kind ach das armes kleine
madchen

then i stared down myself into the
moon pool and there sinking sink-
ing was a little maid whose dead face and
fixed terror-filled eyes looked straight into
mine and ever sinking slowly slowly-
vanished and i knew that this was olafs
freda his beloved yndling whose mother
had snatched her up from the brunhildas
deck when the dweller had wrapped its
awesome coruscating folds about her and
had drawn her the child still in her arms
along the moonbeam path to where we
stood

  but where was the mother and where
had olaf found his babe

  simultaneously it seemed we straight-
ened ourselves the three of us and looked
into each others faces each of us yes
even von hetzdorp shaken to the heart
the german was first to speak

  you have nitroglycerin there yes he
asked pointing toward my medical kit that
i had gripped unconsciously and carried
with me during the mad rush down the
passage i nodded and drew it out

  hypodermic he ordered next curtly
took the syringe filled it accurately-with
its one one-hundredth of a grain dosage
and leaned over huldricksson who with

  arms held out rigidly was fighting for
breath as though a great weight lay on his
chest he rolled up the sailors sleeves half-
way to the shoulder the arms were white
with that same strange semitranslucence
that  had seen on throckmartins breast
where a tendril of the dweller had touched
him his hands were of the same whiteness
-like a baroque pearl above the line of
white standing out like marble on the
bronzed arms von hetzdorp thrust the
needle

  he will need all his heart can do he
said to me

  then he reached down into a belt about
his waist and drew from it a small flat
flask of what seemed to be lead he opened
it and let a few drops of its contents fall
on each arm of the norwegian the liquid
sparkled and instantly began to spread
over the skin much as oil or gasoline drop-
ped on water does only far more rapidly
and as it spread it seemed to draw a
sparkling film over the tainted flesh and
little wisps of vapor rose from it

  the norsemans mighty chest heaved
with agony and i could see the over-
stimulated heart beating in a great pulse
in his throat he strove to rise to his feet
but his weakness was too great his hands
clenched the german gave a grunt of
satisfaction at this dropped a little more
of the liquid and then watching closely
grunted again and leaned back huld-
rickssons labored breathing ceased his
head dropped upon larrys knee and from
his arms and hands the whiteness swiftly
withdrew

  von hetzdorp arose and contemplated
us almost benevolently

  he will all right be in five minutes
he said i khow i do it to pay for that
shot of mine and also because we will need
him yes he turned to larry you have
a poonch like a mule kick my young
friend he said some time you pay me
for that shot eh he smiled and the
quality of the grimace was not exactly
reassuring larry looked him over quiz-
zically

youre von hetzdorp of course he


famous fantastic mysteries

said the german nodded betraying no
surprise at the recognizition

  and you he asked

  lieutenant okeefe of the royal fly-
ing corps replied larry saluting and
this gentleman is dr walter t goodwin

  von hetzdorps face brightened

  the american botanist he queried
i nodded

  ach cried von hetzdorp eagerly
but this is fortunate long i have desired
to meet you your work for an american
is most excellent surprising-

  huldricksson interrupted him the big
seaman had risen stiffly to his feet and
stood with larrys arm supporting him
he stretched out his hands to me

  i saw her he whispered i saw mine
freda when the stone swung she lay there
just at my feet i picked her up and i saw
that mine freda was dead but i hoped-
and i thought maybe mine helma was
somewhere here too so i ran with mine
yndling here- his voice broke

  i thought maybe she was not dead
he went on and i saw that he pointed
to the moon pool and i thought i would
bath her face and she might li-e aean
and when i dipped my hands within the
life left them and cold deadly cold ran
up through them into my heart and mine
freda she fell he covered his eyes and
dropping his head on okeefes shoulder
stood racked by sobs that seemed to tear
at his very soul

chapter viii

the flame-tipped shadows

von hetzdorp nodded his head
solemnly as olaf finished

  jat he said that which comes from
here took them both-the woman and the
child jat they came clasped within it
and the stone shut upon them but why it
left the child behind i do not understand

  larry was watching him in his eyes in-
credulous indignation and amazement

  you too try to tell me that something
carried a woman and a child from a ship

  hundreds of miles away through the air
over the seas to here he cried an edge
of contempt in his voice something that
dr goodwin has said is made of-moon-
shine-carried a strong woman and a child
how do you know

  because i saw it answered von hetz-
dorp simply not only did i see it but
hardly had i time to make escape through
the entrance before it passed whirling and
murmuring and its bell sounds all joyous
ja it was what you call the squeak close
that

  wait a moment i said stilling larry
with a gesture do i understand you to
say that you were within this place

von hetzdorp actually beamed upon me
ja dr goodwin he said i went in
when that which comes from it went out

  i gaped at him stricken dumb into
larrys bellicose attitude crept a suggestion
of grudging respect olaf trembling
watched silently

  dr goodwin and my impetuous young
friend you went on von hetzdorp it
is time that we have an understanding i
have a proposition to make to you also
it is this we are what you call a bad boat
and all of us are in it ja also in this
troublous water we find ourself we need all
hands is it not so let us put together our
knowledge and our brains and resource
he looked wickedly at okeefe and pull
our boat into quiet waters again after
that-

  all very well von hetzdorp inter-
jected larry angrily but i dont feel very
safe in any boat with somebody capable
of shooting me through the back

  von hetzdorp waved a deprecating
hand

  it was natural he said logical yes
here is a very great secret perhaps many
secrets to germany invaluable you are an
enemy of germany although why as an
irishman you should be i do not know

  i	considered the germans proposition
after all what else was there to do he
was undoubtedly a man of resource and
courage and as he said possessed of
special information regarding the phenom-
the conquest of the moon pool

- 

ena i had come to seek what good would
there be in-disposing of him but how
much could he be trusted larry echoed
my thoughts

   in effect goodwin the professors prop-
 osition is this he said he wants to
 know what it is thats going on here and
 he knows he cant do it by himself also he
 knows we have the drop on him were
 three to his one and we have all his hard-
 ware and cutlery

   there was almost a twinkle in von hetz-
 dorps eyes as larry ended he bowed

   it is not just as i would have put it
 perhaps he said but in its skeleton he
 was right nor will i turn my hand against
 you while we are still in danger here i
 pledge you my honor on this

   i glanced at larry half doubtfully and
 back at the german- then i thrust out a
 hand to him he gripped it dropped it
 and thrust his to larry the irishman hesi-
 tated then with a laugh took it

   but ill just keep the guns professor
 he said von hetzdorp bowed again

   now he said to prove my good faith
  will tell you what i know something i
 knew of what was occurring here before i
 was sent-he corrected himself hurriedly
 -before i came i found the secret of the
 door mechanism even as you did dr
 goodwin but by carelessness my conden-
 sers were broken i was forced to wait while
 i sent for others and the waiting might be
 for months i took certain precautions and
 on the first night of this full moon i hid
 myself within the vault of chau-ta-leur
 there is-he hesitated-there is a some-
 thing there also which i do not quite un-
 derstand that-protects but i did not
 know this when i first hid myself neinf
 all i thought was that i could see from
 there and perhaps come through

an involuntary thrill of respect
for the man went through me at the
manifest heroism of this leap of his in the
dark i could see it reflected in larrys
face

  i hid in the vault continued von
hetzdorp and i saw that which comes

 from here come out i waited long hours
 at last when the moon was low i saw it
 return-ecstatically-with a man a native
 in embrace enfolded it passed through the
 door and soon then the moon became low
 and the door closed i had found it difficult
 and had it not been for whatever it is of
 protection there in the vault- he hesi-
 tated again perplexedly

  the next night he went on more
confidence was mine yes and after that
which comes had gone i looked through
its open door i said it will not return
for three hours while it is away why shall
i not into its home go through the door it
has left open so i went-even to here

i looked at the pillars of light and i tested
the liquid of the pool on which they fell
and what i found led me to believe the
shape of light emerged from there

   i started evidently then he did not
know just how the dweller materialized
from the pool he saw my movement and
interpreted it correctly

  you know how it comes he asked
eagerly

   yes i answered later i will tell
you

   i analyzed that liquid he went on
and then i knew i had been right in one
phase at least of my theory that liquid
dr goodwin is not water and it is not
any fluid known on earth he handed me
a small vial its neck held in a long thong

   take this he said and see

   wonderingly i took the bottle dipped
it down into the pool the liquid was ex-
traordinarily light seemed in fact to give
the vial buoyancy i held it to the light
it was striated streaked as though little
living pulsing veins ran through it and its
blueness even in the vial held an intensity
of luminousness

  radioactive said von hetzdorp
some liquid that is intensely radioactive
but what it is i know not at all upon the
living skin it acts like radium raised to the
nth power and with an element most
mysterious added the solution with which
i treated him he pointed to huldricks-
son i had prepared before i came here


famous fantastic mysteries

from information i had of what i might
find it is largely salts of radium and its
base is loebs formula for the neutraliza-
tion of radium and x-ray burns taking
this man at once before the degeneration
had become really active i could negative
it but after two hours i could have done
nothing he paused a moment

  next i studied the nature of these
luminous walls i concluded that whoever
had made them knew the secret of the
almightys manufacture of light from the
ether itself colossal ja but the sub-
stance of these blocks confines an atomic
-how would you say-atomic manipula-
tion a conscious arrangement of electrons
light-emitting and perhaps indefinitely so
these blocks are lamps in which oil and
wick are-electrons drawing light waves
from ether itself a prometheus indeed
this discoverer hein hardly had i con-
cluded these investigations before my
watch warned me to go i went that which
comes forth returned this time empty-
handed

  and the next night i did the same
thing engrossed in research i let the
moments go by to the danger point and
scarcely was i replaced within the vault
when the shining thing raced over the
walls and in its grip the woman and child
then you came and that is all and now
what is it you know

  very briefly i went over my story his
eyes gleamed now and then but he did not
interrupt me

  a great secret a colossal secret he
said at last we cannot leave it hidden

  the first thing to do is to try the door
said larry matter of fact

  there is no use my young friend
said von hetzdorp mildly

  nevertheless well try said larry

  we retraced our way through the wind-
ing tunnel to the end but soon even
okeefe saw that any idea of moving the
slab from within was hopeless we re-
turned to the chamber of the pool the
pillars of light were fainter and we knew
that the moon was sinking on the world
outside before long dawn would be break-

ing i began to feel thirst and the blue
semblance of water within the silvery room
seemed to glint mockingly as my eyes
rested on it

   ja said von hetzdorp reading my
 thoughts uncannily ja we will be
 thirsty and it will be very bad for him of
 us who loses control and drinks of that
 my friend

   larry threw back his shoulders as
 though shaking a burden from them

   were four able-bodied men up against
 a bunch of moonshine and a lot of dead
 ones buck up for heavens sake

   do you suggest that we poonch our
 way out asked von hetzdorp mildly

    forget that professor answered larry
 almost testily i suggest that we look
 around this place and find something that
 will take us somewhere you can bet the
 people that built it had more ways of get-
  ting in than that once-a-month family en-
 trance doc you and olaf explore the
 left wall the professor and i will take the
 right

   he loosened one of his automatics with
 a suggestive movement

    after you professor he said politely
 and i knew that despite the germans ap-
 parent frankness and docility he did not
 trust him

   nor did i and how much did von hetz-
 dorp really know t wondered as the
 norseman and i started off clearly more
 than he had told us and from whence had
 come the information that had been de-
 tailed enough to enable him to prepare an
 antidote for the exact effects the touch of
 the moon pool produced so wondering
 i walked with olaf and then soon forgot
 my perplexity in the contemplation of that
 greater wonder which i was observing

 the chamber widened out from the
 portal in what seemed to be the arc
 of an immense circle the shining walls
 held a perceptible curve and from this
 curvature i estimated that the roof was
 fully three hundred feet above us it oc-
 curred to me that perhaps the chamber
 of the pool was shaped like half a hollow
the conquest of the moon pool



 sphere an inverted bowl as we silently
 passed on i was confirmed in this belief
 for clearly we were circling if i were right
 the circumference of the place reckoning
 the radius at three hundred feet must be
 one thousand eight hundred feet or a
 little less than a third of a mile

   the floor was of smooth mosaic-fitted
 blocks of a faintly yellow tinge they were
 not light-emitting like the blocks that
 formed the walls the radiance from these
 latter i noted had the peculiar quality of
 thickening a few yards from its source and
 it was this that produced the effect of
 misty veiled distances as we walked the
 seven columns of rays streaming down
 from the crystalline globes high above us
 waned steadily  the glow within the cham-
 ber lost its prismatic shimmer and became
 an even gray tone somewhat like moon-
 light in a thin cloud

   now before us out from the wall jutted
 a low terrace it was all of a pearly rose-
 colored stone and above it like a balus-
 trade marched a row of slender graceful
 pillars of the same hue the face of the
 terrace was about ten feet high and all
 over it ran a bas-relief of what looked
 - like short trailing vines surmounted by five
 stalks on the tip of each of which was a
 flower behind the vines ran a design of
 semiglobes from which branched delicate
 tendrils i did not recognize the carved
 flowers they were i thought some sym-
 bolization in which the true form of the
 original had been lost

   how then could i have known the in-
l-redible thing which these stones pictured

   we passed along the terrace it turned
 in an abrupt curve i heard a hail and
 there fifty feet away at the curving end
 of a wall identical with that where we
 stood were larry and von hetzdorp ob-
 viously the left side of the chamber was
 a duplicate of that we had explored we
 joined in front of us the columned bar-
 riers ran back a hundred feet forming an
 alcove the end of this alcove was another
 wall of the same rose stone but uon it
 the design was much heavier

   we took a step forward and then stop-

 ped every muscle rigid there was a gasp
 of terrified awe from the norseman a gut-
 tural exclamation from von hetzdorp for
 on or rather within the wall before us a
 great oval began to glow waxed almost to
 a flame and then shone steadily out as
 though from behind it a light was stream-
 ing through the stone itself

   within the roseate oval two flame-tipped
shadows appeared stood for a moment
and then seemed to float out upon its sur-
face the shadows wavered the tips of
flame that nimbused them with flickering
points of violet and vermilion pulsed out-
ward drew back darted forth again and
once more withdrew themselves and as
they did so the shadows thickened and
suddenly there before us stood two figures

   one was a girl-a girl whose great eyes
were golden as the fabled lilies of kwan-
yung that were born of the kiss of the sun
upon the amber goddess the demons of
lao-tse carved for him whose softly
curved lips were red as the royal coral
and whose golden-brown hair reached to
her knees

  the second was a gigantic frog-a
woman frog head helmeted with carapace
of shell around which a fillet of brilliant
yellow jewels shone enormous round eyes
of blue circled with a broad iris of green
monstrous body of banded orange and
white girdled with strand upon strand of
the flashing yellow gems six feet high if
an inch and with one webbed paw of its
short powerfully muscled forelegs resting
upon the white shoulder of the golden-
eyed girl

chapter ix

id follow her through hell

moments must have passed as we
stood in stark amazement gazing at
that incredible apparition the two figures
although as real as any of those who stood
beside me unfatomlike as it is possible to
be had a distinct suggestion of-projec-
tion

they were there before us-golden-eyed


famous fantastic mysteries

girl and grotesque frog-woman-complete
in every line and curve and still it was as
though their bodies passed back through
distances as though to try to express
the well-nigh inexpressible the two shapes
we were looking upon were the end of an
infinite number stretching in fine linked
chain far away of which the eyes saw only
the nearest while in the brain some faculty
higher than sight recognized and registered
the unseen others

  it crossed my mind that so we three-
dimensional beings might appear to those
dwellers in the hypothetical two-dimen-
sional space we use to help us conceive
the fourth dimension and yet there was
nothing of any metaphysical fourth di-
mension about them they were actualities
-real breathing complete

  the gigantic eyes of the frog-woman
took us all in unwinkingly i could see
little glints of phosphorescence shine out
within the metallic green of the outer iris
ring she stood upright her great legs
bowed the monstrous slit of a mouth
slightly open revealing a row of white
teeth sharp and pointed as lancets the
paw resting on the girls shoulder half
covering its silken surface and from its
five webbed digits long yellow claws of
polished horn glistening against the deli-
cate texture of the flesh

  but if the frog-woman regarded us all
not so did the maiden of the rosy wall
her eyes were fastened upon larry drink-
ing him in with extraordinary intentness
she was tall far over the average of
woman almost as tall indeed as okeefe
himself not more than twenty years old
if that i thought abruptly she leaned
forward the golden eyes softened and grew
tender the red lips moved as though she
were speaking

  larry took a quick step and his face was
that of one who after countless births
comes at last upon the twin soul lost to
him for ages the frog woman turned her
eyes upon the girl her huge lips moved
and i knew that she was talking the girl
held out a warning hand to okeefe and
then raised it resting each finger upon

one of the five flowers of the carved vine
close beside her once twice three times
she-pressed upon the flower centers and
i noted that her hand was curiously long
and slender the digits like those wonder-
ful tapering ones the painters we call the
primitives gave to their virgins

  three times she pressed the flowers and
then looked intently at larry once more
a slow sweet smile curved the crimson
lips she stretched both hands out toward
him again eagerly and then i distinctly
saw a burning blush rise swiftly over
white breasts and flowerlike face

  and in that instant like the clicking
out of a cinematograph the pulsing oval
faded and golden-eyed girl and frog-woman
were gone

  and thus it was that lakla the hand-
maiden of the silent ones and larry
okeefe first looked into each others
hearts

  with their evanishment a spell was
lifted from us olaf huldricksson ran a
hand over a brow from which tiny beads
of sweat had sprung von hetzdorp turned
to me with an exclamation larry stood
rapt gazing at the stone

  eiiidh i heard him whisper eilidh
of the lips like the red red rowan and the
golden-brown hair

  clearly of the ranadae said von
hetzdorp  a development of the fossil
labyrinthodonts you saw her teeth ja

  ranadae yes i answered but from
the stegocephalia of the order ecau-
data-

  upon what evidence do you base your
theory that she was of the stego-

  i think i never heard such complete in-
dignation as was in okeefes voice as he
interrupted the german

  what do you mean fossils and stego
whatever it is he asked she was a girl
a wonder girl-a real girl and irish or
im not an okeefe

  we were talking about the frog-woman
larry i said conciliatingly

  his eyes were wild as he regarded us

  say he said if you two had been in
the garden of eden when eve took the
the conquest of the moon pool



apple you wouldnt have had time to give
her a look for counting the scales on the
snake

   but i took especial note of the girl
 too larry i pleaded mildly and she
 couldnt have been irish now how could
 she

   couldnt eh he said but she was
 didnt you notice the sweet little tilted
 nose of her an the hair an the eyes like
 the sunshine shes a daughter of the old
 people the taithada-dainn im thinkin
 thats who it was anyway that made this
 place on their way to erin not irish a
 girl like that couldnt be anything else
 he strode swiftly over to the wall we
 followed he sounded the stone it did not
 ring hollowly-nor indeed had i expected
 it to for the figures had shadowed them-
 selves through the terrace and had stood
 upon its surface larry paused stretched
 his hand up to the flowers on which the
 tapering fingers of the golden-eyed girl
 had rested

   it was here she put up her hand he
murmured he pressed caressingly the
carved calyxes once twice a third time
even as she had-and silently and softly
the wall began to split on each side a
greatstone pivoted slowly and before us
a portal stood opening into a narrow cor-
ridor glowing with the same rosy lustre
that had gleamed around the flame-tipped
shadows

   okeefe leaped forward i caught him
by the arm the far wall of the tunnel
that had been revealed was not more than
eight feet from where we were and it
ran apparently at right angles to the en-
trance there was little of it to be seen
therefore save the space just in front of
us and i will confess that my nerves were
slightly shaken

   whats the matter he asked

wait i answered dont rush in
there let us go together and carefully
come then quickly he said curiously
distrait i wont wait i must follow
thats what she meant you know
what she meant i echoed stupidly
what she meant when she pointed out

 the way to open the wall of course he
 said impatiently dont you know that
 was why she pressed those flowers she
 meant us-me-to follow her follow her
 why id follow her through a thousand
 hells

   huldricksson stepped beside him he set
 a great hand upon the irishmans shoulder

  ja he rumbled that was no trold-
kvirtde no black witch that jomjru she
was a white virgin ja well i know that
this is trolldom but she will help me find
my helma you go and olaf hul-
drickssons arm you have with you al-
ways ja ready to hold or to strike
come

   his hand fell from larrys shoulder and
 gripped the irishmans own i reached
 down and picked up my emergency kit

  have your gun ready olaf said
larry with huldricksson at one end
okeefe at the other both of them with
automatics in hand and von hetzdorp and
i between them we stepped over the
threshold

at our right a few feet away the
passage ended abruptly in a square
of polished stone from which came the
faint rose radiance of what von hetzdorp
had called the etheric lights the roof
of the place was less than two feet over
okeefes head behind us was the portal
leading into the chamber of the pool

   we turned to the left to look down the
 tunnels length and each of us stiffened a
 yard in front of us lifted a four-foot high
 gently curved barricade stretching from
 wall to wall beyond it was blackness an
 utter and appalling blackness that seemed
 to gather itself from infinite depths and
 to be thrust back by the low barrier as
 a dike thrusts back the menacing sea
 threatening ever to overwhelm it

  the rose-glow in which we stood was
cut off by that blackness as though it had
substance it shimmered out to meet it
and was checked as though by a blow in-
deed so strong was the suggestion of sin-
ister straining force within the rayless
opacity that i shrank back and von hetz-


famous fantastic mysteries

 dorp with me not so okeefe olaf beside
 him he strode to the wall and peered over
 he beckoned us

  flash your pocket-light down there
he said to me pointing into the thick dark-
ness below us the little electric circle
quivered down as though afraid and came
to rest upon a surface that resembled noth-
ing so much as clear black ice i ran the
light across here and there the floor of
the corridor was of stone so smooth so
polished that no man could have walked
upon it it sloped downward at a slowly
increasing angle

  wed have to have non-skid chains and
brakes on our feet to tackle that mused
larry abstractedly he ran his hands over
the edge on which he was leaning sud-
denly they hesitated and then gripped
tightly

  thats a queer one he exclaimed his
right palm was resting upon a rounded
protuberance on the side of which were
three small circular indentations

  he pressed his fingers upon the circles
they gave under the pressure much i
thought as an automatic punch does
okeefes thrusting fingers sank deep
deeper within the stone there was a sharp
click the slabs that had opened to let us
through swung swiftly together a curi-
eusly rapid vibration thrilled through us
a wind arose and passed over our heads a
wind that grew and grew until it became
a whistling shriek then a roar and then
a mighty humming to which every atom in
our bodies pulsed in rhythm painful almost
to disintegration

  the rosy wall dwindled in a flash to a
point of light and disappeared

  wrapped in the clinging impenetrable
blackness we were racing dropping hurl-
ing at a frightful speed-where

  and ever that awful humming of the
rushing wind and the lightning cleaving
of the tangible dark-so it came to me
oddly must the newly released soul race
through the sheer blackness of outer space
up to that throne of justice where god
sits high above all suns

  i felt von hetzdorp creep close to me

gripped my nerve and flashed my pocket-
light saw larry standing peering peering
ahead and huldricksson one strong arm
around his shoulders bracing him and
then the speed began to slacken

  millions of miles it seemed below the
sound of the unearthly hurricane i heard
larrys voice thin and ghostlike beneath
its clamor

  got it shrilled the voice got it
dont worry

  the wind died down to a roar passed
back into the whistling shriek and dimin-
ished to a steady whisper

  press all the way in these holes and
she goes top-high larry shouted dim-
inish pressure-diminish speed the curve
of this-dashboard-here sends the wind
shooting up over our heads-like a wind-
shield whats behind you

  i flashed the light back the mechanism
on which we were ended in another wall
exactly similar to that over which okeefe
crouched

  well we cant fall out anyway he
laughed wish i knew where the brakes
were look out

  we dropped dizzily down an abrupt
seemingly endless slope fell-fell as into
an abyss-then shot abruptly out of the
blackness into a throbbing green radiance
okeefes fingers must have pressed down
upon the controls fdr we leaped forward
almost with the speed of light i caught a
glimpse of luminous immensities- on the
verge of which we flew of depths incon-
ceivable and flitting through the incredible
spaces-gigantic shadows as of the wings of
israfel which are so wide say the arabs
the world can cower under them like a
nestling and then again the dreadful
blackness

  what was that this from larry
with the nearest approach to awe that i
had yet heard from him

  trolldom croaked the voice of olaf

  goti this from von hetzdorp
what a space

  have you considered dr goodwin
he went on after a pause a curious
thing probably the moon was hurled out
the conquest of the moon pool

- 

of this same region we now call the pa-
cific when the earth was yet like molasses
almost molten i should say and is it
not curious that that which comes from
the moon chamber needs the moon rays
lo bring it forth and also that the stone
depends upon the moon for operating jal
and last such a space in mother earth
as we just glimpsed how else could it
have been torn but by some gigantic birth
like that of the moon

   i started there was so much that this
 might explain-an unknown element that
 responded to the moon-rays in opening
 the moon-door the blue pool with its
 weird radioactivity and the peculiar mys-
 tery within it that reacted to the same
 light stream-what is there at the heart
 of earth what of that radiant unknown
 element upon the moon mount tycho
 yes-and what if tychos enigma had it-
 self come from earth heart what miracles
 were hidden there

chapter x

the end of the journey

the car seemed to poise itself for an
instant and then again dipped itself
literally down into sheer space skimmed
forward in what was clearly curved flight
rose as upon a sweeping up-grade and
then began swiftly to slacken its fearful
speed i glanced at the illuminated dial of
the watch on my wrist it had been exactly
twelve minutes since we had seen the
roseate door fade into the blackness but
how far had we gone in those twelve
minutes-scores of miles or hundreds of
miles-there was no knowing

   far ahead a point of light showed grew
 steadily we were within it then softly
 all movement ceased

   it was then i noted that the car for so
  must call it that had brought us to
 this place was shaped somewhat like one
 of the thames punts its back must have
 fitted with the utmost nicety into thend
 of the passage upon which the inner doors
 of the moon pool chamber had opened

for certainly when we stepped within it
there had been no sign that it was other
than part of the wall itself

  where was its guiding mechanism i
could only conjecture that as the car
moved away from the entrance there were
slabs that slipped ingeniously into place
protecting- those within from what would
have been instant annihilating contact with
the tunnel walls when the car ran close
to them or from pitching out when it
skirted in the blackness abysses such as
that luminous green space that had sent
each of our souls shivering back in awe

   the car rested in a slit in the center of
a smooth walled chamber perhaps twenty
feet square the wall facing us was pierced
by a low doorway through which we could
see a flight of steps leading downward

  i glanced upward the light streamed
through an enormous oval opening the
base of which was twice a tall mans
height from the floor a curving flight of
broad low steps led up to it and now it
came to my steadying brain that there
was something puzzling peculiar strangely
unfamiliar about this light it was silvery
shaded faintly with a delicate blue and
flushed lightly with a nacreous rose but
a rose that differed from that of the ter-
races of the pool chamber as the rose
within the opal differs from that within
the pearl in it were tiny gleaming points
like the motes in a sunbeam but sparkling
white like the dust of diamonds and with
a quality of vibrant vitality they were as
though they were alive the light cast no
shadows

  a little breeze came through the oval
and played about us it was laden with
what seemed the mingled breath of spice
flowers and pines it was curiously vivify-
ing and in it the diamonded atoms of the
light shook and danced

  something flashed within the opening-
fluttered and came to rest a bird stood
there regarding us a bird as large as a
pheasant whose golden eyes were the color
of the eyes of the maid of the rosy wall
and whose body was a floating shimmering
cloud of moonlight plumes as fairylike as


famous fantastic mysteries

those that veil the gigantic silver moths
which guard the fellahs say the secret
shrine of isis in the desert beyond the
second cataract and whose touch brings
madness

  for a moment it looked at us then
slowly floated like a shining cloud through
the doorway from without came a sudden
sweet chiming as of tiny golden bells

   okeefe leaped over the low parapet to
the floor sprang to the portal peered
down

  she sent that he said with convic-
tion turning to me she sent it to show
the way

   i caught a faint sardonic grin from von
hetzdorp stepped out of the car the ger-
man following and began to ascend the
curved steps toward the oval opening at
the top of which okeefe and olaf already
stood i hurried forward

   at first all that i could see was space
a space filled with the same coruscating
effulgence that pulsed about me i glanced
upward obeying that instinctive impulse
of earth folk that bids them seek within
the sky for sources of light there was no
sky all was a sparkling nebulosity rising
into infinite distances as the azure above
the day-world seems to fill all the heavens
through it ran pulsing waves and flashing
javelin rays that were like shining shadows
of the aurora echoes octaves lower of
those brilliant arpeggios and chords that
play about the poles my eyes fell beneath
its splendor i started outward

  and now i saw miles away gigantic
luminous cliffs springing sheer from the
limits of a lake whose waters were of
milky opalescence it was from these cliffs
that the spangled radiance came shimmer-
ing out from all their lustrous surfaces
to left and to right as far as the eye could
see they stretched and they vanished in
the auroral nebulosity on high

look at that exclaimed larry i
followed his pointing finger on the
face of the shining wall stretched between
two colossal columns hung an incredible
veil prismatic gleaming with all the colors

of the spectrum it was like a web of rain-
bows woven by the fingers of the daugh-
ters of the jinni in front of it and a little
at each side was a semicircular pier or
better a plaza of what appeared to be
glistening pale-yellow ivory at each end
of its half-circle clustered a few low-walled
rose-stone structures each of them sur-
mounted by a number of high slender pin-
nacles

  of a hugeness that it was von hetz-
dorp have you considered that thosf
precipices must from eight to ten mile
away be dr goodwin and if so how
great must that so strange prismatic cur-
tain that we see so clearly be eh what
hands could carve those columns between
which it hangs it is in my mind that we
will carry back with us many new things
dr goodwin-if we carry back at all he
concluded slowly

   we looked at each other helplessly and
back again through the opening we were
standing as i have said at its base the
wall in which it was set was at least ten
feet thick and so of course all that we
could see of that which was without were
the distances that revealed themselves
above the outer ledge of the oval

   lets take a look at whats under us
said larry

  he crept out upon the ledge and peered
down the rest of us following we stared
in utter silence a hundred yards beneath
us stretched gardens that must have been
like those of many-columned iram which
the ancient addite king had built for his
pleasure ages before the deluge and
which allah so the arab legend tells took
and hid from man within the sahara be-
yond all hope of finding-jealous because
they were more beautiful than his in para-
dise within them flowers and groves of
laced fernlike trees pillared pavilions
nestled

   the trunks of the trees were of emerald
of vermilion and of azure-blue and the
blossoms whose fragrance was borne to
us shone like jewels the graceful pillars
were tinted delicately i noted that the
pavilions were double-in a way two-
the conquest of the moon pool



storied - and that they were oddly
splotched with circles with squares and
with oblongs of opacity i noted too that
over many this opacity stretched like a

roof	

  yet it did not seem material rather
was it-impenetrable shadow

  down through this city of gardens ran 
a broad shining green thoroughfare 
glistening like glass and spanned at regu-
lar intervals with graceful arched bridges
the road flashed to a wide square where
rose from a base of that same silvery
stone that formed the lip of the moon
pool a titanic tower of seven terraces
and along it flitted objects that bore a
curious resemblance to the shell of the
nautilus within them were human figures
and upon tree-bordered promenades on
each side walked others

  far to the right we caught the glint
of another emerald paved road

  and between the two the gardens grew
sweetly down to the hither side of that
opalescent water across which were the
radiant cliffs and the curtain of mystery

  thus it was that we first saw the city
of the dweller blessed and accursed as
no place on earth or under or above earth
has ever been-or that force willing which
some call god ever again shall be

  gottt whispered von hetzdorp in-
credible 

  trolldom  gasped olaf huldricksson
it is trolldom

   with the three of us close behind larry
marched toward the entrance through
which the white bird had floated

  was throckmartin out there in that
strange place i wondered-throckmartin
and his bride stanton and thora-and
olafs wife and how would we find them
in what state was the dweller not mal-
ign a weird inexplicable messenger car-
rying those on whom it set its seal to some
unearthly paradise

  but whatever it was i had found the
place i aimed for

  somewhere here i was convinced
were my lost friend and those he
loved

chapter xi

priestess of the shining one

youd better have this handy doc
okeefe paused at the head of the
stairway and handed me one of the auto-
matics he had taken from von hetzdorp

  shall i not have one also rather
anxiously asked the latter

  when you need it youll get it an-
swered okeefe ill tell you frankly
though professor that youll have to show
me before i trust you with a gun you
shoot too straight-from cover

  the flash of anger in the germans eyes
turned to a cold consideration

  you say always just what is in your
mind lieutenant okeefe he mused
ja-that i shall remember later i was
to recall this odd observation and von
hetzdorp was to remember indeed

  in single file okeefe at the head and
olaf bringing up the rear we passed
through the portal before us dropped a
circular shaft into which the light from
the chamber of the oval streamed liquidly
set in its sides the steps spiraled and
down them we went cautiously the stair-
way ended in a circular well silent with
no trace of exit the rounded stones joined
each other evenly hermetically carved on
one of the slabs was one of the five flow-
ered vines i pressed my fingers upon the
calyxes even as larry had within the moon
chamber

  a crack-horizontal four feet wide-
appeared on the wall widened and as the
sinking slab that made it dropped to the
level of our eyes we looked through a
hundred-feet-long rift in the living rock
the stone fell steadily and we saw that
it was a cyclopean wedge set within the
slit of the passageway it reached the level
of our feet and stopped at the far end of
this tunnel whose floor was the polished
rock that had a moment before fitted
hermetically into its roof was a low nar-
row triangular opening through which
light streamed

  nowhere to go but out grinned larry


famous fantastic mysteries

and ill bet golden eyes is waiting for
us with a taxi he stepped forward we
followed slipping sliding along the glassy
surface and  for one had a lively ap-
prehension of what our fate would be
should that enormous mass rise before we
had emerged we reached the end crept
out of the narrow triangle that was its
exit

  we stood upon a wide ledge carpeted
with a thick yellow moss i looked behind
and clutched okeefes arm the door
through which we had come had vanished
there was only a precipice of pale rock
on whose surfaces great patches of the
amber moss hung around whose base our
ledge ran and whose summits if summits
it had were hidden like the luminous
cliffs in the radiance above us

  nowhere to go but ahead and golden
eyes hasnt kept her date laughed
okeefe-but somewhat grimly

  we looked down at the left the green
roadway curved and at least thirty feet
below us swept on far off to the right it
swerved again and continued as the glisten-
ing distant ribbon we had seen from the
high oval within its loop like a peninsula
its foot bathed by the lake lay the gar-
dened city what was beyond the road we
opuld not see for all along its outer side
it was banked with solid masses of high-
flung verdure

  we walked a few yards along the ledge
and rounding a corner faced the end of
one of the slender bridges from this van-
tage point the oddly shaped vehicles were
plain and we could see they were indeed
like the shell of the nautilus and elfinly
beautiful their drivers sat high upon the
forward whorl their bodies were piled
high with cushions upon which lay women
half-swathed in gay silken webs from the
pavilioned gardens smaller channels of
glistening green ran into the broad way
much as usual automobile runways do
and in and out of them flashed the fairy
shells

  there came a shout from one its occu-
pants had glimpsed us they pointed
others stopped and stared one shell turned

and sped up a runway-and quickly over
the other side of the bridge came a score
of men they were dwarfed-none of them
more than five feet high prodigiously
broad of shoulder clearly enormously
powerful

  trolde muttered olaf stepping be-
side okeefe pistol swinging free in his
hand

  but at the middle of the bridge the
leader stopped waved back his men and
came toward us alone palms outstretched
in the immemorial universal gesture of
truce he paused scanning us with mani-
fest wonder we returned the scrutiny with
interest the dwarfs face was as white
as olafs-far whiter than those of the
other three of us the features clean-cut
and noble almost classical the wide set
eyes of a curious greenish gray and the
black hair curling over his head like that
on some old greek statue

  dwarfed though he was there was no
suggestion of deformity about him the
gigantic shoulders were covered with a
loose green tunic that looked like fine linen
it was caught in at the waist by a broad
girdle studded with what seemed to be
amazonites in it was thrust a long curved
poniard resembling the malaysian kris his
legs were swathed in the same green cloth
as the upper garment his feet were
sandaled

  my gaze returned to his face and in it
i found something subtly disturbing an
expression of half-malicious gaiety that
underlay the wholly prepossessing features
like a vague threat a mocking deviltry
that hinted at entire callousness to suffer-
ing or sorrow something of the spirit that
was vaguely alien and disquieting

he spoke and to my surprise
enough of the words were familiar
to enable me clearly to catch the meaning
of the whole they were polynesian the
polynesian of the samoans which is its
most ancient form but in some indefinable
way-archaic later i was to know that
the tongue bore the same relation to the
polynesian of today as does that of
the conquest of the moon pool



   haucer to modern english

  huldricksson spoke polynesian well
and understood it better than he spoke it
okeefe had a working smattering later
 was to find the german was a master
of it

  from whence do you come strangers
and how found you your way here said
the green dwarf

  i waved my hand toward the cliff be-
hind us his eyes narrowed incredulously
he glanced at its drop upon which even
a mountain goat could not have made its
way and laughed

   we came through the rock i answered
his thought and we come in peace  
added

  and may peace walk with you he
-aid half-derisively if the shining one
wills it

   he considered us again

  show me strangers where you came
-through the rock he commanded we led
the way to where we had emerged from
the well of the stairway

   it was here i said tapping the cliff

    but i see no opening he said suavely

   it closed behind us i answered and
then for the first time realized how in-
credible the explanation sounded the
derisive gleam passed through his eyes
again but he drew his poniard and gravely
sounded the rock

   you give a strange turn to our speech
he said it sounds strangely indeed-as
strange as your answers he looked at us
quizzically i wonder where you learned
it well all that you can explain to the
afyo maie his head bowed and his arms
swept out in a wide salaam be pleased to
come with me he ended abruptly

   in peace i asked

  in peace he replied then slowly
with me at least

  oh come on doc cried larry as
long as were here lets see the sights
allons mon vieuxl he called gaily to the
green dwarf the latter understanding the
spirit if not the words looked at ofeefe
with a twinkle of approval

   he stood aside and waved a hand cour-

teously inviting us to pass we reached
the bridge again he spoke two words to
his men who immediately lined up on
each side of the arch watching us as we
walked between them with that same sug-
gestion of expectant malicious derision
that i found so disquieting in their leader
we crossed at the base of the span one
of the elfin shells was waiting

  free ride in the subway patrol
whispered okeefe grinning

  beyond scores of the shells had gath-
ered their occupants evidently discussing
us in much excitement the green dwarf
waved us to the piles of cushions and then
threw himself beside us the vehicle started
off smoothly the now silent throng mak-
ing way and swept down the green road-
way at a terrific pace and wholly without
vibration toward the seven-terraced tower

we turned abruptly and swept
up a runway through one of the
gardens and stopped softly before a pil-
lared pavilion i saw now that these were
much larger than i had thought the struc-
ture to which we had been carried covered
i estimated fully an acre oblong with
its slender vari-colored columns spaced
regularly its walls were like the sliding
screens of the japanese i had little time
to note them nor to my regret to satisfy
my very eager curiosity as to the character
of the trees and the beautiful bowering
blossoms

  the green dwarf hurried us up a flight
of broad steps flanked by great carved
serpents winged and scaled he stamped
twice upon mosaicked stones between two
of the pillars and a screen rolled aside
revealing an immense hall scattered about
with low divans on which lolled a dozen
or more of the dwarfish men dressed iden-
tically as he

  they sauntered up to us leisurely the
surprised interest in their faces tempered
by the same inhumanly gay malice that
seemed to be characteristic of all these peo-
ple we had as yet seen

  the afyo maie awaits them rador
said one


famous fantastic mysteries

  so the green dwarfs name was rador

  he nodded beckoned us and led the
way through the great hall and into a
smaller chamber whose far side was cov-
ered with the opacity i had noted from
the aerie of the cliff i examined the-
blackness-with lively interest

  it had neither substance nor texture
it was not matter-and yet it suggested
solidity an entire cessation a complete
absorption of light an ebon veil at once
immaterial and palpable i stretched in-
voluntarily my hand out toward it and
felt it quickly drawn back

 do you seek your end so soon
whispered rador but i forgot that you
do not know he added on your life
touch not the blackness ever it-

  he stopped for abruptly in the density
a portal appeared springing out of the
shadow like a picture thrown by a lantern
upon a screen through it was revealed
a chamber filled with a soft rosy glow
rising from cushioned couches a woman
and a man regarded us half leaning over
a long low table of what seemed polished
jet laden with flowers and unfamiliar
fruits

  about the room-that part of it at
least that i could see--were a few oddly
shaped chairs of the same substance on
high silvery tripods stood three immense
globes and it was from them that the rose
glow emanated at the side of the woman
stood a smaller globe whose roseate gleam
was tempered by quivering waves of blue

  enter rador with the strangers a
clear sweet voice called

  rador bowed deeply and stood aside
motioning us to pass we entered the green
dwarf behind us and out of the corner
of my eye i saw the doorway fade as
abruptly as it had appeared and again the
dense shadow fill its place

  come closer strangers be not afraid
commanded the bell-toned voice

  we approached

  the woman unimaginative scientist that
i am made the breath catch in my throat
never had  seen a woman so beautiful as
was yolara of the dweller city and none

of so perilous a beauty her hair was of
the color of the young tassels of the corn
and-coiled in a regal crown above her
broad white brows her wide eyes were
of gray that could change to a corn-flower
blue and in anger deepen to purple gray
or blue they had little laughing devils
within them but when the storm of anger
darkened them they were no longer laugh-
ing

  the silken web that half covered hall
revealed her did not hide the ivory white-
ness of her flesh nor the sweet curve of
shoulders and breasts but for all her
amazing beauty she was sinister there
was cruelty about the curving mouth and
in the music of her voice not conscious
cruelty but the more terrifying careless
cruelty of nature itself and she exhaled
an essence of vitality that made the nerves
tingle toward her and shrink from her
too as though from something that was
abnormal

  the girl of the rose wall had been beau-
tiful yes but here beauty was human
understandable you could imagine her
with a babe in her arms but you could
not so imagine this woman about her
loveliness hovered something unearthly a
sweet feminine echo of the dweller was
yolara the dwellers priestess-and as
gloriously terrifyingly evil

chapter xii

the justice of lora

as i looked at her the man arose
and made his way round the table
toward us for the first time my eyes took
in lugur a few inches taller than the
green dwarf he was far broader more
filled with the suggestion of appalling
strength

  the tremendous shoulders were four feet
wide if an inch tapering down to mighty
thewed thighs the muscles of his chest
stood out beneath his tunic of red around
his forehead shone a chaplet of bright-
blue stones sparkling among the thick curls
of his silver-ash hair
the conquest of the moon pool



  upon his face pride and ambition were
written large and power still larger all
the mockery the malice the hint of cal-
lous indifference that i had noted in the
other dwarfish men were there too-but
intensified touched with the satanic

  the woman spoke again

  who are you strangers and how came
you here she turned to rador or is it
that they do not understand our tongue

  one understands and speaks it but
very badly o yolara answered the green
dwarf

  speak then that one of you she
commanded

  but it was von hetzdorp who found
his voice first and i marveled at the
fluency so much greater than mine with
which he spoke

  we came for different purposes i to
seek knowledge of a kind he-pointing
t me-f another this man-he looked
at olaf-to find a wife and child

  the gray-blue eyes had been regarding
okeefe steadily and with plainly increas-
ing interest

  and why did you come she asked
him nay i would have him speak for
himself if he can she stilled von hetz-
dorp peremptorily

  when larry spoke it was haltingly in
the tongue that was strange to him search-
ing for the proper words

  i came to help these men and because
something i could not then understand
called me o lady whose eyes are like
forest pools at dawn he answered and
even in the unfamiliar words there was
a touch of the irish brogue and little
merry lights danced in the eyes larry had
so apostrophized

   i could find fault with your speech but
none with its burden she said what
forest pools are i know not and the dawn
has not shone upon the people of lora
these many sais of laya but i sense what
you mean

  the eyes deepened to blue as she re-
garded him i saw lugur shift impatiently
and send a none too pleasant look at
okeefe she smiled

  are there many like you in the world
from which you come she asked softly
well we soon shall-

  lugur interrupted her almost rudely and
glowering

  best we should know how they came
hence he growled

  she darted a quick look at him and
again the little devils danced in her won-
drous eyes

  yes that is true she said how
came you here

  again it was von hetzdorp who an-
swered-slowly considering every word

  in the world above he said there
are ruins of cities not built by any of
those who now dwell there to some of
us above these places called and we sought
for knowledge of those wise ones passed
on we were seeking and we found a
passageway the way led us downward to
a door in yonder cliff and through it we
came here

  then you have found what you
sought spoke she for we are of those
who built the cities but this gateway in
the rock-where is it

  after we passed it closed upon us
nor could we after find trace of it an-
swered von hetzdorp

  the incredulity that had shown upon
the face of the green dwarf fell upon
theirs on lugurs it was clouded with
furious anger

  he turned to rador

  i could find no opening lord thus
the green dwarf quickly

  and there was so fierce a fire in the
eyes of lugur as he swung back upon us
that okeefes hand slipped stealthily
down toward his pistol

  best it is to speak truth to yolara
priestess of the shining one and to lugur
the voice he cried menacingly

  it is the truth i interposed we
came down the passage at its end was a
carved vine a vine of five flowers-the
fire died from the red dwarfs eyes and i
could have sworn to a swift pallor i
rested a hand upon these flowers and a
door opened but when we had gone


famous fantastic mysteries

through it and turned behind us was noth-
ing but unbroken cliff the door had van-
ished

  i had taken my cue from von hetz-
dorp if he had eliminated the episode of
car and moon pool he had good reason i
had no doubt and i would be as cautious
and deep within me something cautioned
me to say nothing of my quest to stifle
all thought of throckmartin something
that warned peremptorily finally as
though it were a message from throck-
martin himself

  a vine with five flowers exclaimed
the red dwarf was it like this say

  he thrust forward a long arm upon
the thumb of the hand was an immense
ring set with a dull-blue stone graven on
the face of the jewel was the symbol of
the rosy walls of the moon chamber that
had opened to us their two portals but
cut over the vine were seven circles one
about each of the flowers and two larger
ones covering intersecting them

  this is the same i said but these
were not there-i indicated the circles

  the woman drew a deep breath and
looked deep into lugurs eyes

  the sign of the silent ones he half
whispered

  it was the woman who first recovered
herself

  the strangers are weary lugur she
said when they are rested they shall
show us where the rocks opened

  i sensed a subtle change in their atti-
tude toward us a new intentness a doubt
plainly tinged with apprehension what
was it they feared i wondered and why
had the symbol of the vine wrought the
change and who or what were the silent
ones

yolaras eyes turned to olaf hard-
ened and grew cold gray subcon-
sciously i had noticed that from the first
the norseman had been absorbed in his
regard of the pair had indeed never taken
his gaze from them had noticed too the
priestess dart swift glances toward him

  upon olafs face had been an early look

of puzzlement of uncertainty now this
had changed to decision clearly he had
madfi his mind up about something his
gaze was fixed he returned the womans
scrutiny fearlessly a touch of contempt
in the clear eyes-like a child watching a
snake which he did not dread but whose
danger he well knew

  under that look yolara stirred impa-
tiently sensing i know its meaning

  why do you look at me so she cried

  an expression of bewilderment passed
over olafs face

  i do not understand he said in eng-
lish

  i caught a quickly repressed gleam in
okeefes eyes he knew as i knew that
olaf must have understood but did von
hetzdorp

  i glanced at him apparently he did not
but why was olaf feigning this ignorance

  this man is a sailor from what we call
the north thus larry haltingly he is
crazed i think he tells a strange tale of
a something of white fire that took his
wife and babe we found him wandering
where we were and because he is strong
we brought him with us that is all o
lady whose voice is sweeter than the honey
of the wild bees

  a shape of white fire she repeated
eagerly

  a shape of white fire that whirled be-
neath the moon with the sound of little
bells answered larry watching her in-
tently

  she looked at lugur and laughed

  then he too is fortunate she said
for he has come to the place of his some-
thing of white fire and tell him that he
shall join his wife and child in time that
i promise him

  upon the norsemans face there was no
hint of comprehension and at that moment
i formed an entirely new opinion of olafs
intelligence for certainly it must have
been a prodigious effort of the will indeed
that enabled him understanding to con
trol himself

  what does she say he asked

  larry repeated
the conquest of the moon pool



  an expression of gladness spread over
his face

  good said olaf good

  he looked at yolara with well-assumed
gratitude lugur who had been scanning
his bulk drew close he felt the giant
muscles which huldricksson accommodat-
ingly flexed for him

  but he shall meet valdor and tahola
before he sees those kin of his he laughed
mockingly and if he bests them he shall
meet me after that-for reward-his wife
and babe

  a shudder quickly repressed shook the
seamans frame the woman bent her
supremely beautiful head

  these two she said pointing to the
german and me seem to be men of learn-
ing they may be useful as for this man
-she smiled at larry-i would have
him explain to me some things she hesi-
tated what hon-ey of e wild bees-s
is she laughed sweetly sinisterly and
now-take them rador give them food
and water and let them rest till we shall
call them again

  she stretched out a hand toward
okeefe the irishman bowed low over it
raised it softly to his lips there was a
vicious hiss from lugur but yolara re-
garded larry with eyes now all tender blue
you please me she whispered

  and the face of lugur grew dark with
passion

  we turned to go the rosy azure-shot
globe at her side suddenly dulled from
it came a faint bell sound as of chimes far
away she bent over it it vibrated and
then its surface ran with little waves of
dull color from it came a whispering so
low that i could not distinguish the words
if words they were

  she spoke to the red dwarf

  they have brought the three who
blasphemed the shining one she said
slowly now it is in my mind to show
these strangers the justice of lora per-
haps they may learn wisdom from it
what say you lugur

  the red dwarf nodded his eyes sparkl-
ing now with a malicious anticipation

  the woman spoke again to the globe
bring them here

   and again it ran swiftly with its film of
colors darkened and shone rosy once
more from without there came the rustle
of many feet upon the rugs yolara pressed
a slender hand upon the base of the
pedestal of the globe beside her abruptly
the light faded from all and on the same
instant the four walls of blackness van-
ished revealing on two sides the lovely
unfamiliar garden through the guarding
rows of pillars at our backs soft draper-
ies hid what lay beyond before us flanked
by flowered screens was the corridor
through which we had entered crowded
now by the green dwarfs of the great hall

the dwarfs advanced each i now
noted had the same clustering black
hair of rador they separated and from
them stepped three figures-a youth of
not more than twenty short but with
great shoulders of all the males we had
seen of this race a girl of seventeen i
jdftged white-faced a head taller than
the boy her long black hair disheveled
and clad in a simple white sleeveless gar-
ment that fell only to the knees and be-
hind these two a stunted gnarled shape
whose head was sunk deep between the
enormous shoulders whose white beard
fell like that of some ancient gnome down
to his waist and whose eyes were a white
flame of hate the girl cast herself weep-
ing at the feet of the priestess the youth
regarded her curiously

  you are songar of the lower waters
murmured yolara almost caressingly and
this is your daughter and her lover
the gnome nodded the flame in his eyes
leaping higher

  it has come to me that you three have
dared blaspheme the shining one its
priestess and its voice went on yolara
smoothly also that you have called out
to the three silent ones is it true
your spies have spoken and have you
not already judged us the voice of the
old dwarf was bitter

  a flicker shot through the eyes of


famous fantastic mysteries

yolara again cold gray the girl reached
a trembling hand up to the hem of her
veils she thrust it aside with her foot
cruelly

  tell us why you did these things son-
gar she asked why you did them
knowing well what your reward would be

  the dwarf stiffened he raised his with-
ered arms and his eyes blazed

  because evil are your thoughts and
evil are your deeds he cried yours and
your lovers there he leveled a finger
at lugur because of the shining one
you have made evil too and the greater
wickedness you contemplate-you and he
with the shining one but i tell you that
your measure of iniquity is full the tale
of your sin near ended yea the silent
ones have been patient but soon they
will speak he pointed at us a sign are
they-a warning-harlot he spat the
word

   in yolaras eyes grown black the devils
leaped unrestrained

  is it even so songar her voice ca-
ressed now ask the silent ones to help
you they sit afar but surely they will
hear you the sweet voice was mocking
as for these two they shall pray to the
shining one for forgiveness and surely
the shining one will take them to its
bosom as for you you have lived long
enough songar pray to the silent ones
songar and pass out into the nothingness
-you

  she dipped down into her bosom and
drew forth something that resembled a
small cone of tarnished silver she leveled
it a covering clicked from its base and
out of it darted a slender ray of intense
green light

  it struck the old dwarf squarely over
the heart and swift as light itself spread
covering him with a gleaming pale film
she clenched her hand upon the cone and
the ray disappeared thrust it back into
her breast and leaned forward expectantly
so lugur and so the other dwarfs from
the girl came a low wail of anguish the
boy dropped upon his knees covering his
face

  for the moment the white beard stood
rigid then the robe that had covered him
seemed- to melt away revealing all the
knotted monstrous body and in that body
a vibration began increasing to incredible
rapidity it wavered before us like a reflec-
tion in a still pond stirred by a sudden
wind it grew and grew to a rhythm whose
rapidity was intolerable to watch and that
still chained the eyes

  the figure grew indistinct misty tiny
sparks in infinite numbers leaped from
it-like i thought the radiant shower of
particles hurled out by radium when seen
under the microscope mistier still it grew
and then there trembled before us for a
moment a faintly luminous shadow which
held here and there tiny sparkling atoms
like those that pulsed in the light about
us the glowing shadow vanished the
sparkling atoms were still for a moment-
and then they shot away joining those
dancing others

  where the gnomelike form had been but
a few seconds before-there was nothing

  okeefe drew a long breath and i was
sensible of a prickling along my scalp

  yolara leaned toward us

  you have seen she said her eyes
lingered tigerishly upon olafs pallid face
heed she whispered she turned to the
men in green who were laughing softly
among themselves

  take these two and go she com-
manded

  the justice of lora said the red
dwarf the justice of lora and the shin-
ing one under thanaroa

  upon the utterances of the last word i
saw von hetzdorp start violently the
hand at his side made a swift surrepti-
tious gesture so fleeting that i hardly
caught it the red dwarf stared at the
german and for the first time i saw com-
plete amazement upon his face

  he glanced at yolara found her intent
in thought and as swiftly as had been von
hetzdorps action returned it i thought
i saw the latter make an answering sign

  yolara the red dwarf spoke it would
please me to take this man of wisdom to
the conquest of the moon pool



my own place for a time the giant i
would have too

  the woman awoke from her brooding
nodded

  as you will lugur she said she
beckoned rador

  as he led us out i saw from the corner
of my eye olaf following quietly the ger-
man and the red dwarf and again i
wondered

  and as shaken to the core we passed
out into the garden into the full throbbing
of ihe light i wondered if all the tiny
sparkling diamond points that shook about
us had once been men like songar of the
lower waters-and felt my very soul grow
sick

chapter xiii

the angry whispering globe

our way led along a winding path be-
tween banked masses of feathery
ferns whose plumes were starred with
fragrant white and blue flowerettes slen-
der creepers swinging from the branches
of the strangely trunked trees bearing
along their threads orchidlike blossoms
both delicately frail and gorgeously flam-
boyant like the giant mosses which i
later saw in the caverned road to the sea
of crimson in our flight to the silent ones
i could not identify them

   a smaller pavilion arose before us single-
storied front wide open upon its thresh-
old rador paused bowed deeply and
motioned us within the chamber we en-
tered was large closed on two sides by
screens of gray at the back gay conceal-
ing curtains the low table of blue stone
dressed with fine white cloths stretched
at one side flanked by the cushioned
divans

  at the left was a high tripod bearing
one of the rosy globes we had seen in
the house of yolara at the head of the
table a smaller globe similar to the whis-
pering one rador pressed upon its base
and two other screens slid into place across
the entrance shutting in the room

  he clapped his hands the curtains
parted and two girls came through them
tall and willow lithe their bluish-black
hair falling in ringlets just below their
white shoulders their clear eyes of for-
get-me-not blue and skins of extraordi-
nary fineness and purity-they were singu-
larly attractive each was clad in an ex-
tremely scanty bodice of silken blue
girdled above a kirtle that came barely
to their very pretty knees

  the maidens returned our stares with
interest and now i noted that the uncanny
deviltry written so large upon the faces
of the dwarfs limned so delicately upon
that of yolara was here but a shadow
present it certainly was but tinctured
underlaid with a settled wistfulness al-
most melancholy

  they gave me i must admit only a
slight share of their attention larry the
most of it i lack nearly a foot of his
height my eyes are spectacled

  their wistfulness fled they laughed
with little gleams of milky teeth-the
laughter of careless youth-and larry
laughed with them the green dwarf re-
garded all with his malice-tipped smile

  food and drink he ordered

  they dropped back through the curtains

  do you like them he asked us

  some cuties said larry they de-
light the heart he translated for rador

  the green dwarfs next remark made me
gasp they are yours he said

  the pair re-entered bearing a great
platter on which were small loaves strange
fruits and three immense flagons of rock
crystal-two filled with a slightly sparkl-
ing yellow liquid and the third with a
purplish drink i became acutely sensible
that it had been hours since i had either
eaten or drank the yellow flagons were
set before larry and me the purple at
radors hand

  the girls at his signal again with-
drew i raised my glass to my lips and
took a deep draft the taste was unfamil-
iar but delightful

  almost at once my fatigue disappeared
i realized a clarity of mind an interesting


famous fantastic mysteries

exhilaration and sense of irresponsibility
of freedom from care that were oddly en-
joyable larry became immediately his old
gay self

  still there did not seem to be any of
the characteristics of alcohol in the drink
the bread was excellent tasting like fine
wheat the fruits were as unfamiliar as
the wine and seemed to have the quality
of making one forget any desire for either
flesh or vegetables the green dwarf re-
garded us whimsically sipping from his
great flagon of rock crystal

  much do i desire to know of that
world you came from he said at last-
through the rocks he added mischiev-
ously

   and much do we desire to know of this
 world of yours o rador i answered

  should i ask him of the dweller seek
from him a clue to throckmartin again
clearly as a spoken command came the
warning to forbear to wait and once more
i obeyed

  let us learn then from each other
the dwarf was laughing and first
are they all like you-drawn out he
made an expressive gesture and are there
many of you

  there are- i hesitated and at last
spoke the polynesian that means tens upon
tens multiplied indefinitely-there are as
many as the drops of water in the lake
we saw from the ledge where you found
us i continued many as the leaves on
the trees without and they are all like us
but varyingly

   he considered skeptically i could see
 my remark upon our numbers

  in muria he said at last the men
are like me or like lugur our women are
as you see them like yolara or like those
black-haired two who served you he
hesitated and there is a third but only
one

   larry leaned forward eagerly

  brown-haired with glints of ruddy
bronze golden eyed and lovely as a dream
with long slender beautiful hands he
cried

   where saw you her interrupted the
dwarf starting to his feet

   saw- her larry recovered himself
nay rador perhaps i only dreamed that
there was such a woman

   see to it then that you tell not your
dream to yolara said the dwarf grimly
for her i meant and her you have pic-
tured is lakla the handmaiden to the
silent ones and neither yolara or lugur
nay nor the shining one love her over-
much stranger

   does she dwell here larrys face
was alight

   the dwarf hesitated glanced about him
anxiously

   if she does doc were going to beat
it her way quick larry shot the words
to me quickly

   nay rador was answering ask me
no more of her he was silent for a space
and what do you who are as leaves or
drops of water do in that world of yours
he said plainly bent on turning the sub-
ject

   keep off the golden-eyed girl larry
i interjected wait till we find out why
shes taboo

   love and battle strive and accomplish
and die or fail and die answered larry
-to rador-giving me a quick nod of ac-
quiescence to my warning in english

   in that at least your world and mine
differ little said the dwarf

  how great is this world of yours
rador i spoke

   he considered me gravely

   how great indeed i do not know he
said frankly at last the land where we
dwell with the shining one stretches along
the white waters for- he used a phrase
of which i could make nothing beyond
this city of the shining one and on the
hither shores of the white waters dweil
the mayia ladala the common ones he
took a deep draft from his flagon there
are first the fair-haired ones the children
of the ancient rulers he continued there
are second we the soldiers and last the
mayia ladala who dig and till and weave
and toil and give our rulers and us their
the conquest of the moon pool



daughters and dance with the shining
one he added

  who rules i asked

  the fair haired under the council of
nine who are under yolara the priestess
and lugur the voice he answered who
are in turn beneath the shining one
there was a ring of bitter satire in the
last

  and those three who were judged-
this from larry

  they were of the mayia ladala he
replied like those two i gave you but
they grow restless they do not like to
dance with the shining one the blas-
phemers  he raised his voice in a sudden
great shout of mocking laughter

  in his words i caught a fleeting picture
of the race an ancient luxurious close-
bred oligarchy clustered about some mys-
terious deity a soldier class that sup-
ported them and underneath all the toil-
ing oppressed hordes

  and is that all asked larry

  no he answered beyond the lower
waters over the black precipices of doul
are the forests where lie the feathered
serpents and the secrets they guard the
black precipices of doul are hard to pass
but none can pass through the feathered
serpents and there is the sea of crimson
where- he stopped abruptly drank and
set down his flagon empty whatever the
purple drink might be it was loosening
the green dwarfs tongue and neither of
us cared to interrupt him

  it is strange strange indeed to be sit-
ting with two who have newly come from
that land that we were forced from so
many sais of laya agone he began again
half musingly gone upon another tangent
for we too came from your world but
how long long ago i have heard that the
waters swept over us slowly but dragging
ever dragging our land beneath them and
we sought refuge in the secret heart of our
land refusing to leave her and at the last
we made our way here where was the shin-
ing one and where had been othersjjefore
us who had left behind them greater knowl-
edge than we brought-and that was no

little strangers and now the laya turn
upon themselves the tail of the serpent
coils close to his fangs he took a great
drink of the yellow liquid his eyes flashed

  and without warning the globe beside
us sent out an almost vicious note rador
turned toward it his face paling its sur-
face crawled with whisperings-angry per-
emptory

  i hear he croaked gripping the table

i obey

  he turned to us a face devoid for once
of its malice

  ask me no more questions strangers
he said and now if you are done i will
show you where you may sleep and bathe

  he arose abruptly we followed him
through the hangings passed through a
corridor and into another smaller chamber
roofless the sides walled with screens of
dark gray two cushioned couches were
there and a curtained door leading into
an open outer enclosure in which a foun-
tain played within a wide pool of polished
green stone its opalescent column rose
high and from it fell sprays of shimmer-
ing milky water

  your bath said rador he dropped
the curtain and came back into the room
he touched a carved flower at one side
there was a tiny sighing from overhead
and instantly across the top spread a veil
of blackness impenetrable to light but cer-
tainly not to air for through it pulsed lit-
tle breaths of the garden fragrances the
room filled with a cool twilight refresh-
ing sleep-inducing the green dwarf
pointed to the couches

  sleep he said sleep and fear noth-
ing my men are on guard outside he
came closer to us the old mocking gaiety
sparkling in his eyes

  but i spoke too quickly he whispered
whether it is because the afyo maie
fears their tongues-or- he laughed at
larry the maids are not yours still
laughing he vanished through the curtains
of the room of the fountain before i could
ask him the meaning of his curious gift
its withdrawal and his most enigmatic clos-
ing remarks

trouble is brewing

ome stuff that green ray of yo-
laras said okeefe deepest admir-
ation in his voice can you imagine what
it would be like in a war-seeing the enemy
all at once beginning to shake themselves
to pieces wow

  its easy enough to explain larry i
answered the effect that is-for what
the green ray is made of i dont know of
course but what it does clearly is stimu-
late atomic vibration to such a pitch that
the cohesion between the particles of mat-
ter is broken and the body flies to bits

  the green ray set up in the dwarf that
incredibly rapid rhythm that you saw and
-shook him to atoms

  all at once i was aware of an intense
drowsiness okeefe yawning reached
down to unfasten his puttees

  lord im sleepy he exclaimed
what made reddy take such a shine to
the von he asked drowsily

  thanaroa i answered fighting to
keep my eyes open when lugur spoke
that name i saw von hetzdorp signal him
thanaroa is i suspect the original form
of the name of tangaroa the greatest
god of the polynesians theres a secret
cult to him in the islands von hetzdorp
may belong to it he knows it anyway
lugur recognized the signal and despite
his surprise answered it

  the heinie gave him the high sign
eh mused larry how could they both
know it

  the cult is a very ancient one un-
doubtedly it had its origin in the dim be-
ginnings before these people migrated
here i replied its a link-one-of the
few links between up there and the lost
past

  trouble then mumbled larry hell
brewing i smell it say doc is this
sleepiness natural half incoherently

  but i myself was struggling now des-
perately against the drugged slumber
pressing down upon me

  lakla i heard okeefes murmur
lalda of the golden eyes-no eilidh-
the faitl

  good luck old boy wherever youre
going his hand waved feebly glad-
knew-you hope-see-you-gain-

  his voice trailed into silence fighting
fighting with every fiber of brain and nerve
against the sleep i felt myself being stead-
ily overcome but before oblivion rushed
down upon me i seemed to see upon the
gray screened wall nearest the irishman
an oval of rosy light begin to glow
watched as my falling lids inexorably fell
a flame-tipped shadow waver on it
thicken condense and there looking down
upon larry her eyes great golden stars
in which intensest curiosity and shy ten-
derness struggled sweet mouth half smil-
ing was the girl of the moon pools cham-
ber the girl whom the green dwarf had
named-lakla the vision larry had in-
voked before the sleep which i could no
longer deny had claimed him

  and did i see about and behind her a
cloud of other eyes-not those phosphor-
escent saucers of the frog womans enor-
mous eyes-triangular-pools of shining
jet flecked with little rushing flickering
ruby flames

  closer she came-closer-the eyes were
over us then oblivion indeed

when i awakened it was with all
the familiar homely sensation of a
shade having been pulled up in a darkened
room i thrilled with a wonderful sense of
deep rest and restored resiliency the ebon
shadow had vanished from above and down
into the room was pouring the silvery
light from the fountain pool came a
mighty splashing and shouts of laughter
i jumped over and drew the curtain
okeefe and rador were swimming a wild
race the dwarf like an otter outdistanc-
ing and playing around the irishman at
will i plunged in

  tiring at last we swam to the edge
and drew ourselves out the green dwarf
quickly clothed himself and larry rather
carefully donned his uniform
the conquest of the moon pool



  the afyo maie has summoned us
doc he said were to-well i suppose
youd call it breakfast with her after
that rador tells me were to have a ses-
sion with the council of nine i suppose
yolara is as curious as any lady of-the
upper world as you might put it-and
just naturally cant wait he added

  he gave himself a last shake patted
the automatic hidden under his left arm
whistled cheerfully

  after you my dear alphonse he said
to rador with a low bow the dwarf
laughed bent in an absurd imitation of
larrys mocking courtesy and started
ahead of us to the house of the priestess
when he had gone a little way on the
orchid-walled path i whispered to okeefe
larry when you were falling off to
sleep did you think you saw anything
see anything he grinned i was hit
by that sleep like a fly swatted by goliath
but wait a minute- he hesitated i
had a queer sort of dream

  what was it i asked eagerly
well he answered slowly i suppose
it was because id been thinking of-
golden eyes anyway i thought she came
through the wall and leaned over me yes
and she put one of those long white hands
of hers on my head i couldnt raise my

lids but in some queerish way i could
see her then it got real dreamish she
had eyes all about her a whole little cloud

of them-

  like these larry i asked i drew a
pencil from my pocket and sketched the
high triangles of flame-flecked blackness
i had seen in my own vision

  how did you know that he cried
in utter amazement rador turned back
toward us i slipped the paper in my
pocket

  later i answered not now when
were alone

  but through me went a little glow of
reassurance whatever the maze through
which we were moving whatever of men-
acing evil lurking there the golden girl
was clearly watching over us

  we passed the pillared entrance in
the great hall were the same green dwarfs
this time introduced to us by a variety
of names each saluted throwing the right
hand high above the head we went
through a long bowered corridor and stop-
ped before a door that seemed to be sliced
from a monolith of pale jade-high nar-
row set in a wall of opal

  rador stamped twice and with those
supernally sweet silver bell tones the door
swung open

a bizarre story of one mans
astral and earthly duality

who is charles avison

by edison tesla marshall

no one knew what was going on
behind the high board fence at
the avison place which was dif-
ficult to climb besides avisons stolid
neighbors were reluctant to show so much
curiosity

  but a few boys lived in the neighbor-
hood who were not troubled by such a
sense of decorum the tallest of them
boosted another of the gang until a
pair of round eyes gazed between the
pickets however the report that the spy
made to the other boys-and later to
his parents-was certainly far from en-
lightening

  he had seen the big house of course
with its trim lawns and walks and also
he had seen another building that had
been erected since the fence it was built
much like a garage but didnt quite look

like a garage either protruding out of
it was the queerest thing-almost like a
huge egg of blue steel with slabs of heavy
glass and many encircling bands of iron

  it was some time after this that another
boy returning in the late dusk from his
milk-delivery had a story to tell that
no one had ever quite believed as he
talked his face flushed and his eyes
widened he said something almost spher-
ical in shape dark except for lighted
windows had rolled up into the air above
the fence straight up unwaveringly and
had kept on going

  the boy had watched it till the haze
of evening shut it from his sight until
it had vanished among the early stars

  you imagined it my son said his
father but his mother noticed that her
husband was perplexed

who is charles avison

ill

  no i didnt i saw it as plain as i
see you

  well concluded the father well
probably know what it was in the morning

but dear he added turning to his
wife that avison is quite a scientist
the delivery-boy wandered into the wrong
door at the avison place one day and
he told me he went into the uncanniest-
looking room he was ever in a laboratory
of some kind it was with big machines
of porcelain and steel and copper

  and you know he wrote some sort
of a scientific article just when he got
out of college supplemented his wife
it caused quite a sensation among the
scientists

  thats right it was about gravity
wasnt it lets see that was four years
ago i had almost forgotten hes a smart
young chap all right

  but why doesnt he go into busi-
ness the woman protested hes been
engaged for almost a year now to that
cole girl you know and if something
should happen to him-

  oh well hes probably pretty careful
and youre sure you didnt imagine it
son or dream it

  im sure sir replied the boy

  nor had he dreamed or imagined it
and had charles avison wished he could
have surprised even more the scientific
world but he wished to wait

  it was true he had been engaged to
agnes cole for twelve months in truth
she was mightily afraid of an accident to
the young scientist even avison had con-
fessed to the danger in this latest experi-
ment of his

  the afternoon before the vulcan as-
cended avison had spent with agnes
they had had a long talk in which he
told her much of his plan but little of
the danger but there was a chance he
said that he would not be at hand to
marry her on the june day selected

  she had tried to dissuade him

  i must go he said yott cant
imagine how much it means but im sure
nothing will happen oh ill come back

all right my trial flight was a wonderful

success

  his great dark eyes glowed at the
thought of it

  goodby dearest

  they had kissed and she had cried

  then from the porch of her home she
had seen the strange dark bubble of a
thing float away into the skies

a few nights later the farmers thirty
miles from avisons home might
have observed a few spots of light hover-
ing in the air over the wide field of a
deserted farm they might have discerned
the light-spots dart back and forth then
down then up a way and then descend
to earth but it is not recorded that any
man was awake to see

  charles avison unscrewed the round
door of the vulcan and crept out in-
stantly the light died from its windows
at first he could not stand but staggered
twice and fell in a heap under the curved
side of the machine he lay a little while
then flashed his light about and into the
door of a great deserted barn in front
of which his machine had alighted

  he climbed to his feet and steadied
himself after a little while he thrust his
shoulder against the dark sphere arid
rolled it as silently as a great snowball
into the high doorway then he glanced
at his watch

  not far from morning he said

  he walked unsteadily toward the road

  avison congratulated himself on his
nearness to home a few hours before
when he had awakened from unconscious-
ness he had been over water he had
risen from the bottom of the sphere
where he had fallen with swimming head
and drumming ears and getting his bear-
ings had guided the machine toward home
his light was failing when he was still
thirty miles away however so he had
thought it safer to descend

  his experiment had been a success

  then he began to wonder what had
occurred in that brief period of uncon-
sciousness and was it so brief his watch


famous fantastic mysteries

had said  just before he had fainted
and  just after he had awakened but
had it been one hour or twenty-five his
ears still rang he walked drunkenly

  he sat down in a fence-corner to await
daylight he saw the stars-his compan-
ions he called them-begin to dim as a
wide ribbon of grayish blue showed aboye
the eastern horizon he saw this ribbon
widen still more and soon he could detect
the lines of his hands at his feet were
flowers wet with dew

  avison lighted a cigar but he could
hardly see the smoke in the bluish dawn
but before the fire in it became too warm
for his fingers it was daylight

  he arose and looked about he knew
the place-he had driven along the road
many times in his car he knew the great
barn where he had housed the vulcan
the long line of straggly telephone-poles
the spinelike row of poplars beside the
creek

  just thirty miles to home and agnes
he would start to walk to the nearest
railway station some friend in a car
would probably pick him up

  but somehow-avison did not know
how or what or why-something every-
thing did not seem natural he could not
be mistaken in the place the trees the
farms the houses even the fence-posts
were familiar but that queer haunting
feeling of unfamiliarity remained he could
not shake it off it must be that he had
not yet completely recovered from his
fainting

  he started along the road he laughed
when he saw a deep rut that had once
broken a spring of his car here was
the muddy spot where a tiny creek seeped
across the highway here was the bridge
with its familiar hole where octavius his
favorite horse always shied

  the ringing in his ears had gone now
he walked perfectly straight his head no
longer swam but the feeling of alienation
was as marked as ever

  avison became a little frightened even
though he knew the road perfectly he
tested his knowledge soon he would arrive

at the crossroads where the lane turned
off toward the old fair grounds yes
he catfte to the place just where he
thought it would be

  but why was it that everything was
the same and yet different he knew
even the ruts of the road and the cract
in the telephone post where the lightning
had once struck he knew the quiet fields
of grain the pretty farm-homes the horses
in the fields yet he felt-he knew it now
-that something was terribly different

  he saw the farmers on their way to
the dairy barns he heard the windmills
creaking and the call of the hired men
as they hitched their teams to the farm-
ing implements the world about him
was commonplace and ordinary just as
always on a late spring morning in the
country but he could not shake off the
illusive feeling

  he tried to he tried to think of other
things he whistled and smoked again
but found it useless

  he heard an automobile behind him-
the commonplace honk of the horn and
the chug of the engine a touring car
bearing only a driver came up to him
the car stopped as avison waved his
arm

  can you give me a lift the scientist
called

  sure

  avison took a seat beside the driver
and looked at him searchingly

  youre johnston arent you he asked
as the car started

  yes but i dont remember you the
other man said

  my name is avison-charles avison

  johnston looked at him quickly

  are you charles avison he asked
i have heard of you many times

  he stretched out a gauntleted hand
and found his companions thin long-
fingered one

  we cant be far from smithford can
we avison asked

  smithford was a little town but a few
miles from his home

  about fifteen miles replied the
who is charles avison



driver and what are you doing along
this road at this hour may i ask
taking a morning walk replied
avison

the road was becoming more familiar
he knew many of the names that
he saw on the mail-boxes he knew the
dog that barked from the gateway of a
farmhouse-a dog that had always barked
at him but yet he was perplexed and
bewildered by the lingering sensation of
unfamiliarity

  after ten miles the automobile slowed
i have to turn here said johnston
which way are you going

  straight on i guess and thank you
avison hopped out of the slowly mov-
ing car and started again down the dusty
road he began to wonder why johnston
had not recognized him they had passed
each other several times avison put his
hands to his face he felt several days
growth of hair

  of course that was the reason he
needed a shave very badly on the day
of his ascent and in the five days at
least that he was in the air a black
growth had covered his cheeks and chin
and his face felt thinner the bones pro-
truded

  soon he passed a farmhouse-one where
he had often stopped for a meal while
quail hunting so he entered the gate
he was hungry for a warm breakfast again
he knew the dog that came to meet him
and patted its furry head the old woman
at the doorway did not recognize him

  he told her what he wanted and she
led him to the kitchen he washed in a
basin at the back and looked at himself
in the glass

  no wonder the others had not known
him his face was much thinner great
dark bags hung beneath his eyes

  who would have thought that the days
in the air could have been such a physical
strain his white hollow cheeks and
wide black eyes in contrast to tire black
hair shocked him no wonder he remained
unknown to johnston and the woman

  during the meal he asked but one
question and it was a peculiar one

  whats the date he asked

  the old woman looked up quickly

  twenty-fourth she replied

  avison had gone up on the sixteenth
he had been two days unconscious

  and still the brooding strangeness per-
plexed and bewildered him

  again he was out on the road he
picked up another ride soon and when
he came to smithford he took off the
grease-stained clothes he had worn on
the air journey he laughed at himself
in the suit he had just bought in bad
need of a hair-cut and shave and in
different clothes he wondered if agnes
would know him

  the small town was at the end of his
walk he could take the train from there
to his home he walked about the town
although he was well known there and
many people looked at him interestedly
none came up to speak to him he laughed
to himself over the fact that even an old
friend did not know him

  the train-the slow old train in which
he had so often ridden-pulled in an
hour later by now it was noon the
avison place was scarcely a half-hours
ride away he remembered the worn-out
plush on the seat of the cars the con-
ductor who punched his ticket but always
something was not quite the same

  the trip has affected my mind he
said at last

  he could almost scream at the harass-
ment of it all he could not analyze or
place his finger on the difference but it
was there it was everywhere the change
of circumstance brooded about him and
haunted him and made him grip his hands
his eyes widened at the thought of it

  was he asleep or hurt

  or dead-dead anything was pos-
sible to him now

  what if he were dead

  then he laughed at himself for being
a fool the laugh was hysterical the
train newsie eyed him suspiciously he
pinched himself on the arm and the hurt


famous fantastic mysteries

was real but something had changed him
or changed the world in which he lived

  the train stopped at last at avisons
own town at the outskirts of which stood
his own house agnes lived here too half-
frightened avison wondered whether
agnes would know him

  but it would be good sport if she
didnt

  so he dropped into a second-hand store
and traded his trim cap for an old bat-
tered hat this he pulled down over his
eyes and started down the quiet street
some boys stared at him as he passed but
no one spoke in recognition a dog that
he knew slunk away from him

  even the town was different

  yes the stores and the people and
the fountains and the sparrows in the
streets and the signs were all the same
in every physical particular but there
had been change and avison swore at
himself

at a street-corner he saw a group
of men talking quietly although
they glanced at him they did not speak
to him and yet he knew every one of
them

  as he passed he heard his name men-
tioned he paused a minute as if to stare
across the street

  i knew it would happen some time
old felix barnes was saying ive told
him so a hundred times but he would
go on making experiments its a good
thing his mother isnt alive it would about
kill her

  and they say agnes cole is just pros-
trated said another of the group

  agnes cole avison listened more at-
tentively

  the funeral procession ought to start
soon said another

  a ghastly feeling of sickness rose in
avison he clenched his hands

  how did it happen anyway does
anybody know asked a youth i just
got back to town and this is the first ive
heard of it

  from under his arm barnes drew a

folded newspaper which he opened slowly

  heres the account-as much as an
one kiifljvs he explained avison wenl
up on the sixteenth for a four-day trip
according to miss cole he had some
scheme for beating gravity mind you
think of that-beating gravity

poor fellow murmured the youth

  well they found his machine wreckec
to pieces just outside of town yesterday
every bone in his body was broken 
heard the crash myself when the machine
fell

  panic-stricken avison turned away hi
pinched himself again his eyes were wide
he knew his scalp twitched at a news-
stand he bought a paper and feverishly
read of his own death

  the machine said the account was
broken to pieces the name plate on
which appeared the word

vulcan

had been found however

  wildly avison grasped at every pos-
sibility that came to his mind coincidence
of course but what a devilish one some
aviator had been killed so badly crushed
that even his own family had mistaken
his identity avison mut hurry out to
his home and tell his family that he lived
he must tell agnes too

  but was he alive

  he cursed himself as a fool for letting
the question come to his mind but what
did he know of the region and state of
death his eyes widened even more at
the thought of it

  but it couldnt be that-it couldnt
he pricked his chest with a pin then
he pricked his hand till he brought blood

  he came in sight of the old church
where he had gone to sunday school as
a boy and where his father had gone
before him the old ivy-grown church
with its sleepy belfry and its quiet lawn
out in front were many carriages and
automobiles the sound of singing came
up to him-a funeral dirge
who is charles avison



  avison hung back he was afraid to
go on to that church

  what if the boly in the coffin should
be his

  he cursed himself again and slowly
went on but he must see the dead man
before the coffin was closed he began
to walk swiftly

  he climbed the steps and entered the
church doors it was filled with his own
friends the sexton looked at him but
did not recognize him timidly he sat
down just beside an acquaintance the
man was weeping quietly

  the service was nearing its close when
avison entered almost at once the white-
haired old parson said that those who
wished might look again at the body

  the people stood up the young scientist
with them agnes in black her face tear-
stained was in front near her stood his
sister weeping he dared not approach
them there was his uncle-all of his
cousins slowly and wearily the train of
people began to walk past the long coffin
of black avison followed them

  what if it is he whispered what
if it is

  he gripped himself and resolved to
keep his control he came slowly up

  and the pall-bearers saw a young man
at the end of the line-one who looked
familiar and yet whom they thought they
did not know one who needed a shave
and wore a ridiculous suit of clothes-
clench his hands until the nails nearly
tore the flesh and go white as the flowers
banked about the coffin

  avison rushed to the open air then
he pressed his hands to his lips to sup-
press a scream

  it is i he moaned it is my own
body

  and winding away out of the town
the funeral procession had started for the
graveyard

considering everything - avison
kept his self-control well he re-
solved that he would not go insane that
there had been some monstrous coinci-

dence that the smooth face in the coffin
was not his own but this reflection was
the only thing that preserved his sanity

  that day passed and that night and
still the young man did not sleep he
had secured a room in the hotel and
he tried to forget in the smoke of many
strong cigars that a ghost could smoke
cigars in the morning he slept a little

  that day his beard was longer than
ever and this together with the thinness
of his face disguised him perfectly at
ten he caught a train for a near-by city
there he could think it out away from
agnes and his mourning relatives to
whom he felt a deadly fear of identifying
himself

  in the city he secured a hotel room
and again tried to think he was baffled
bewildered afraid the strangeness of
everything remained but not in such a
marked degree as in his home town

  a coincidence he kept repeating it
must be it cant be anything else

  after a few days he began to think
of his science again what if he were
taken for dead he himself knew now
that he was alive and well he ate heartily
at the hotel grill he saw an occasional
movie

  but yet he could not go back to the
avison place nor to agnes-at least until
the memory of the familiar face in the
coffin had faded from the minds of those
at home he shut it out of his own mind

  then he thought of his machine out
in the great deserted barn they had found
the wreck of the dead mans machine
and machines do not have ghosts he felt
more himself every day finally he re-
membered that an observatory in connec-
tion with a great university was situated
just outside the city so one day he had
his beard and mustache trimmed put on
a large pair of dark glasses and went
out to talk to the head of the astronomy
department

  i am vunden of heidelberg he told
gray the old astronomer and i would
like a position the money part of it is
of no importance to me


famous fantastic mysteries

  this did not surprise gray he knew
many men on the faculty who worked
only for the love of it he questioned the
young man whose knowledge of the stars
he found amazing so gray procured
vunden a position on a low salary and
avison went to work again at his old
love it was only for a little while he
thought until he could straighten out
things a little better in his mind the
work might make him forget at least
it would end the monotony of idleness

  but it came about that he was not
long at the observatory a few weeks after
he obtained his position there came an
eclipse of the sun that noon as avison
stared into the eye-piece of the telescope
he saw for an instant at the edge of the
dark rim of the nioon a new planet the
significance of it struck avison squarely
between the eyes

  he sat back staring into space for a
few seconds then started up with raised
arms gray the old astronomer found
him laughing and crying hysterically

  whats the matter vunden he de-
manded

  matter matter great heavens be-
gan avison excitedly then he calmed
himself i have made the greatest dis-
covery in the scientific world i have made
two of them in fact but this one is the
greatest in the history of astronomy look
through the telescope

  what is it questioned gray as he
adjusted te glass

  look avison rasped

  gray glanced a moment at the tiny
orb the moon hid it as he watched

  a new planet the old man was
staggered why has it never been seen
before

  his face flamed

  i can tell you why it is in perpetual
eclipse by the sun just opposite from
us the once or twice a year it is not
eclipsed probably on account of the eclipse
of the earths course around the sun it
is too near the sun to be seen dont you
understand dont you

  but why-

  oh i will tell you everything soon

but first tell me this along the twentieth
of may was there a kind of meteoric
disturbance-a comet

  how came you not to notice that a
meteor swept very near the earth but
tell me-

  no let me go i wont explain now
i cant but i will write to you in a day
or so

  then as he hurried out to think
that i should find out the truth at last

it was only a day or so later that
vunden disappeared as if from the face
of the earth but a mimeograph copy of
a strange letter came to every great
scientist in the nation and one letter
the original came to one recipient who
was not a scientist at all agnes cole

  it made many a gray-haired astronomer
shake his head unbelievingly but agnes
understood the communication read

  to agnes and to the scientific men
  of the world

     i do not expect you to believe what
   i have written here but  only ask that
   you investigate and you will then learn
   that what i say is true and i charles
   david avison of there not of here
   -but an equal in mind ability and
   genius of the charles david avison who
   died for science here of whom you
   already know-i swear to you that it
   is the truth

     if you do not believe it is no mat-
   ter for even now i feel that perhaps
   i am doing wrong to add to the knowl-
   edge of the world wherein i do not
   belong

     understand firs that there are two
  earth worlds in order that you may
  not confuse them i will call the one
  in which  now am here the other is
  there

     both were thrown off from the sun
  as spiral nebula at the same instant
  here went one direction and there the
  other both being of the same size
  gravity overcame the centrifugal force
  at exactly the same distance in space
  from the sun

    the two cooled the same time of
  course their oceans formed coinci-
  dentally and the first germs of life
  appeared upon there at the identical
  instant that they appeared here
who is charles avison



    have already told you enough lo
enable you lo understand what oc-
curred there is no fate or chance in
life-everything is cause and effect
cause and effect

   so as life developed there its exact
counterpart developed here for every
caveman there one was here-his
exact counterpart in appearance
everything that he did or thought
or fell the caveman here did or
thought or felt at the same time and
so it was through the ages

   when i charles david avison was
born there charles david avison was
born here when he began to love

i began to love when he made that
greatest discovery of all ages-the s
waves which conducted through a cer-
tain substance will render it immune
to the attraction of gravity i made it
there together we built spherical ma-
chines and at the same second chris-
tened them the vulcan

   i will not tefl here of my discovery
but will leave it for some one else to
make one who belongs on this here
of yours yonr world has had its avi-
son my world still awaits the benefits
accruing from the discoveries of its
own avison

   on the same day we each made trial
flights i there on that far-away
counterpart world and he here a few
months later on the sixteenth of may
we left our worlds he left here and i
left there and each of us floated away
toward the stars

  each of us had air for many days
and food enough but then for the
first time something happened there
that did not happen here for the first
time the dualism was broken

  a meteor came near there when
one did not come here my vulcan was
attracted to it by gravity and before i

could throw the s waves into the metal
covering to render us immune i was
sweeping after it at a terrific pace
faster than our finite minds can con-
ceive i became unconscious then why

i do not know

  and i see now what happened the
meteor carried me across that infinite
expanse to a point where the gravity
of i his world began to grip me  began
to fall

  i remember now that when i wak-
ened the sea was below me i remember
that i threw on the s waves just in
time and floated down to safety

   do not know how the other charles
avison of here fell to his death  know
that bis machine was as good as mine
for the laws of cause and effect or-
dered it so i can only attribute his
fall to some influence on this metew
this monstrous disturber out of space
the meteor probably never struck the
earth it might now be buried deep in
the cold surface of the moon

  i have no place in this world of
yours i am a stranger here in fact

	have no place anywhere now for my
counterpart is dead if i stay here the
old dualism will be broken still more
and our two worlds would soon become
most different places it is broken any-
way now for there is a mans body
beneath the grass of here that is not
there

  when you get this i will have
boarded my vulcan and will have
started out into that strange wonderful
maze of worlds

  perhaps i will go home-or perhaps

to a new world perhaps i will not get
anywhere but i do not care i would
die out there among the stars or per-
haps on their unknown surfaces the
greatest voyager that the worlds have
ever known

tapping of quick little heels on polished

wood she entered the living-room of the

house via the entrance hall

and then nellie paused she stared at

the figure of a small man with spectacles

 whu-roo he gave vent to a fuii-toned irish on the bridge of a high thin nose and
 shout of amazed comprehension and continued  	i		  

his progress aloft	iron-gray whiskers he stood with back-

 teouw the sound was one of
it i feline protestation a sort of out-
raged plaint uttered in the ac-
cents of a snarling rage

  goodness was that fluffy exclaimed
miss nellie zapt to her fiance bob sar-
gent with whom she was sitting in the
dusk back of the vines on the porch of
her fathers house

  sounded like her voice at any rate
bob agreed

  meouw psst zit

  nellie started to her feet and stood
slenderly poised as a fresh outburst of
something suspiciously like inarticulate
profanity drifted to her ears and then
she laid hold of her companion

  come along theres something wrong
she urged and dragged him to his feet

  she darted into the house intent on
learning what had evoked the outcries so
vociferously emitted by her pet and sar-
gent followed very much as he had been
following her for something like a year
she was a dainty glowing creature and
bob was all tangled up in her feminine

tilted head beside a small tin pail de-
posited on the table in the center of the
room

  father miss zapt gasped

  and sargent also exclaimed good
lord

  eh xenophon xerxes zapt un-
known quantity zapt as his associates
sometimes called him because of the double
x in his name the celebrated investiga-
tor of the unknown in science lowered his
head and jerked it around in the direction
of his daughters voice there was the
atmosphere about him of a small boy ap-
prehended in some prank he put out a
hand and laid it on the little tin pail did
you speak my dear out of near-sighted
blue eyes he peered at his radiant offspring
who had drawn herself up in an indignant
fashion

  i did said miss zapt firmly i sup-
pose youre responsible for that

she lifted a graceful arm and pointed
overhead as indeed she very well might
considering that she pointed at the wildly
gyrating form of a superb angora cat
one would hardly expect to find a per-

the gravity experiment



sian angora flattened with no visible
means of support against the ceiling of a
room as this one certainly was she hung
there threshing with frantic legs at the im-
palpable air with a motion not unlike a
rather desperate effort at swimming then
she spun herself about in a circle marked
by a rapidly alternating head from which
gleamed yellow eyes and a twitching bushy
tail her behavior was little short of
hysteria

   meouw she voiced her troubled state
 once more as she heard her mistresss voice

   with poor tact sargent chuckled seems
 to have got the angoras angora he began

   miss zapt gave him a withering glance

   never mind fluffy pet she called en-
 couragement to the glaring creature that
 had temporarily given over its efforts and
 rested with back-pressed against the ceil-
 ing

   and then she bore down on the little
man who had once more lifted his eyes
to the animal above him i suppose this
is another of your detestable experiments
she went on in a voice half tears and half
rage what have you done to my cat

   nothing nothing-about the seventy-
fifth of an ounce professor zapt fumbled
in his pocket for notebook and pencil
opened the former and touched the latter
to his lips

   father miss zapt seized both book
and pencil she stamped her foot

   eh oh yes yes-exactly xenophon
xerxes glanced into her flushed face as
a matter of fact i have done nothing to
your pet my child nothing at all worth
mentioning that is indeed as you will
note i have even exercised extreme caution
i have closed the windows and the ceiling
of course prevents her further ascension
but if you refer to her present position-

   it is rather unusual dont you think
 professor said bob now if she were
 a flying squirrel-

  exactly xenophon zapt cut him
short the term flying-squirrel is a mis-
nomer however robert the qjpmal so-
called is incapable of sustaining itself for
any considerable time in the air as to the

 former part of your remark however hers
 is indeed a most unusual position it is
 that which proves the complete success of
 my experiment you are now witnessing
 one of the marvels of the ages-voluntary
 levitation the rediscovery of one of the
 lost secrets of the ancients the means by
 which-

   abruptly nellie caught up the little pail
 i suppose your lost secrets in this

  and swiftly xenophon zapt put out a
hand to retrieve what she had seized
nellie he commanded sternly replace
that receptacle where you found it as
you surmise it contains a substance of
incalculable value the first practical
preparation of zapts repulsive paste

   wha-a-at sargent crossed to gaze in-
 to the little bucket his fiancee was holding
 does look sort of repulsive he agreed
 after a glance at the mess in the bottom of
 the pail but-you mean this stuff is
 responsible for fluffys sudden elevation
 in life

   exactly professor zapt nodded the
 animal is not injured except in her feelings

 i assure you i merely rubbed a very small
 portion of the paste into the fur on the
 under side of her body and she assumed
 the position you are now privileged to be-
 hold i am sure that in later years you
 will be glad to recall this evening to re-
 member that you were the first to witness
 the reapplication of those principles once
 before known to our race you-

   just at present his daughter inter-
 rupted im far more interested in know-
 ing whether having sent her up there you
 intend letting her remain until she starves
 to death

  eh professor zapt frowned
starves why certainly not having
demonstrated to our satisfaction the effi-
cacy of this latest addition to science we
may consider the test as ended if robert
will obtain a stepladder from the basement
and you will procure some water in order
that we may wash off the paste-

   sure bob said and departed on his
errand nellie went with him as far as
the kitchen


famous fantastic mysteries

  trofissor zapt shook his head in
depreciative fashion retrieved his
notebook and pencil from the table where
nellie had cast them and began jotting
down certain memoranda his thin lips
moved as his pencil traced its way across
a page the seventy-fifth part of an
ounce he muttered

   above his graying head glared a very
much disgruntled cat it was not the first
time her mistresss father had made her
the subject of some experiment

   sargent and nellie reappeared in due
season bob set up his ladder and mounted
to the rescue below nellie waited with
a basin of warm water and a soft cloth in
her hands

   lay her on her back professor zapt
advised as sargent descended with the
angora clinging desperately to him that
way she will not present any tendency to
rise the paste does not affect anything be-
neath it but merely what is superimposed
that is the secret of its adaptability
exactly bob said grinning and got
down upon his knees

   nellie knelt beside him together they
 administered to the resentful cat while
 bob held her nellie applied water to the
 body of her pet and dried her fur with the
 cloth fluffy glared but submitted to su-
 perior force

   steady said bob at last and turned
 her over he removed his restraining hands
 and in a flash she vanished through the
 door into the hall

  xenophon watched the entire perfor-
mance his blue eyes glowing behind their
lenses he nodded as she disappeared he
rubbed his hands together as bob rose
and assisted nellie to her feet a very
satisfactory experiment he declared a
very satisfactory experiment indeed

   if you dont let fluffy alone-nellie
 turned on him- ill-ill pack up and
 leave home for years since her mothers
 death she had taken care of the little
 mans temporal wants and managed the
 house but there were times when his com-
 plete attention to his scientific pursuits
 and his lack of attention to everything else

 got badly on her nerves and now her vio-
 let eyes were winking and her red mouth
 quivered

   any time you feel like that ill see
 you have another to go to bob suggested
 as she paused with a little catch in breath

   ahem xenophon xerxes zapt glared
he did not approve so wholly of bob as
did his daughter do not make any pre-
mature preparations robert he said
after a rather tense interval in which
nellie blushed the animal is not injured
as you yourself have seen and as nellie
will realize in time the main difficulty
against which scientists have to contend
in these days of self-interest is the con-
ventional attitude of the average mind

   human beings are prone to allow some
 purely personal view-point to overshadow
 the major object to be attained in the
 present instance it is consideration for a
 cat it is permitted to obscure the fact
 that through her use we have demonstrated
 the rediscovery of the means by which the
 egyptians built the pyramids

   what by jove sargent opened his
eyes in wonder as the point struck home
you really mean that professor
exactly said xenophon zapt be-
nignly and stroked the graying whiskers
on either side of his chin

   but if thats the qase bob began
quickly and came to a tonguetied pause
it is the case robert

  i know-but- sargent floundered
if it is why couldnt you have proved it
just as well with a book or a rock or a
box

   for an instant the professors blue eyes
 twinkled i suppose i could have done
 so robert he replied but as a matter
 of fact i took the first object at hand when
 i was ready to make the test i-er-that
 is i didnt give the matter any further
 thought

  my mind was focused on the larger
point the demonstration which proves be-
yond question that zapts repulsive paste
will revolutionize the commercial world
by means of it we shall be able to ac-
complish marvels heretofore quite beyond
the gravity experiment



 any engineering scope we shall by insert-
 ing definite quantities of the paste between
 the object to be transported and the earth
 be able to move enormous buildings nullify
 the weight of tremendous loads alter the
 entire present-day conception as apper-
 taining to weight

  -i dont doubt it bob agreed in actu-
ally enthusiastic fashion lord professor
its simply wonderful when you explain
it and its already sent fluffy to the ceil-
ing and moved nellie to tears

  you beast said miss zapt but she
smiled

  her father frowned my chief objection
to you robert is the somewhat bizarre
sense of humor which induces you to ap-
proach matters of weight in a light mood
if you would refrain from undue levity
there are timeswhen i would be inclined
to appreciate your otherwise not unin-
telligent apprehension of the results of
scientific investigation

  i beg your pardon sir bob apolo-
gized meekly what was it you were say-
ing about the pyramids

  the world has long marveled how they
were built how it was possible to transport
and place in their walls monoliths of such
enormous size the answer was suggested
some years ago but never carried further
so far as i am aware it was reserved for
me to prove the truth of that suggestion
and give again to the world a substance
similar in effect at least to the one they
used

  that substance you have seen in oper-
ation tonight it is in principle a screen
for gravitation objects above it become
for the moment practically devoid of
weight mere trifles light as air

  you mean it cuts off the operation of
gravitation on anything above it bob
asked why thats marvelous professor
exactly xenophon zapt agreed
dead or alive

  animate or inanimate as you have
seen the professor rubbed his hands
he eyed the stylish shoes his-daughters
fiance was wearing for instance robert

i	could rub a certain amount on the soles

of your shoes and you would walk a cer-
tain distance from the floor depending
upon the quantity employed in proportion
to your weight you would rise slightly or
higher as the centripetal force of the earth
revolutions threw you off

  the entire action is capable of regula-
tion by means of a calculation based upon
the weight of the object to be moved if i
knew your exact weight i could cause you
to lose ponderability altogether i could
even make you disappear still he sighed
i presume nellie would object to that
even more loudly than she protested my
use of the cat however as a matter of
scientific demonstration it would be in-
teresting i think

  oh very bob drew his modish foot-
wear well under the chair in which he was
sitting and nellie stiffened

  xenophon zapt arose i think i shall
go to my study now and write a brief
account of my experiment tomorrow i
shall begin the preparation of a large
amount of the powder which blended with
water constitutes the paste i shall or-
ganize a company after a bit if you wish
robert i shall permit you to purchase a
reasonable amount of stock good night
good night sir thank you said bob
and watched him disappear a quaint little
figure in his loose slippers his iron-gray
whiskers and his shapeless flapping coat

  and after the professor was quite out
of sight bob turned to nellie lord do
you suppose hes really got it he re-
marked something surely happened to
fluffy and after we washed off the paste
she was all right and-i guess those old
wiseacres did know something in their day
it makes a fellow feel funny-egyptians
and pyramids and all those old things
five minutes later while professor
xenophon xerxes zapt drew paper before
him and dipped his pen in ink his daughter
and sargent sat very close together on the
living-room couch

rprue to his promise professor xeno-
-l phon xerxes zapt spent the major
portion of the succeeding day mixing and


famous fantastic mysteries

blending the ingredients of the powder
which when mixed with water constituted
the repulsive paste he heaped it upon
a tray and left it on a table in the upstairs
room that he habitualy used as the scene
of his scientific investigations-a room
overlooking from broad windows the tree-
shaded street

  and the succeeding morning he charged
downstairs about ten and informed nellie
that he had nearly overlooked the fact that
he meant to attend the meeting of a scien-
tific body to which he belonged in a neigh-
boring town in considerable haste he ar-
rayed himself in clean shirt and collar the
frock-coat to which he consistently clung
and hat and was on the point of de-
parture for a train when nellie suggested
that he had better wear his shoes rather
than the slippers on his feet the pro-
fessor acceding rather impatiently to the
suggestion the change of footgear was
made and he departed after that the day
dragged past until four oclock

   at that hour bob sargent seated in the
 office where he dispensed legal advice to
 sundry clients answered a ring on his
 phone

  oh bobby came the voice of miss
zapt come up to dinner dads gone to
one of his society meetings and he wont
be home till rather late and with all these
recent burglaries and hold-ups in the city
im sort of nervous

  yes you are said sargent with the
chuckle deriding the confession of miss
zapts timorous nerves

   yes really i am she insisted youll
come wont you bob

   t sill said bob without hesitation
and he did

   because he was in love and a dinner
with his sweetheart tete-a-tete is something
no true lover in his senses will pass up
he arrived about six with a box of nellies
favorite candy and anticipations of a
pleasant evening since miss zapts ex-
perience as manager of her fathers house-
hold had made a dinner under her super-
vision a thing not to be missed

   in this particular case anticipation
proved no more than the precursor of re-
alization the dinner was a course affair
of finely balanced quality and the two
young people rather dallied over it from
soup to cheese as young people sometimes
will until a sudden deepening of the twi-
light sent nellie to the window just as a
peal of thunder reverberated sharply
through the house

   goodness its going to rain cats and
dogs bob she exclaimed the skys as
black as ink

   let er rain said sargent content
with a well-filled stomach and the society
of the lady of his affections weve a good
roof over our heads so we should worry
i was thinking of father nellie ex-
plained and giggled as she recounted the
professors attempt to leave home without
his shoes hes so absent-minded about
little things mercy

  a small cyclone seemed sweeping
through the house sending curtains eddy-

ing in flapping streamers and doors bang-
ing as they were caught and slammed in
the draft

  there followed a few moments of rapid
effort in closing windows and making all
secure and then youth and maiden stood
briefly watching the first dashing flurry of
the summer shower before they pulled
down the shades and withdrew to a low-
toned conversation dealing as usual under
similar conditions quite largely with them-
selves

  meanwhile some distance up the street
a large and heavy-set figure sheltered it-
self as best it might beneath an arching
tree while waiting for the shower to pass

  it was that of officer dan mcguiness
patrolman on the beat that included the
zapt house it wasnt a very exciting beat
as a rule but recently danny had been
nursing hopes as miss zapt had said to
bob that afternoon there had been a lot
of burglaries of late and danny really
couldnt see why fate should not be kind
and send one of the as yet unapprehended
prowlers into his quiet street he was
thinking about it now as he listened to
the patter of the rain among the leaves

  shure it would be a grand noght for a
poorch-climber to git in his fancy wuruk
he soliloquized th wind an th rain
would cover any noises he might be makin
tis th sort of noight id consider as made
to me order was i a burglar myself

  and the thought having taken hold upon
him was with him still as the shower swept
on across the countryside and the moon
appearing began to flirt with the dripping
landscape from behind a veil of ragged
clouds it sent him on down the street
with a wary eye for any burglarious-minded
individual who might have been of the
same opinion as himself

  thus he came in time to a house yith
a wide front porch above which was an
open window and rising over the top of
the porch as danny watched an object
like a human head

  with a heart beginning to lgat more
quickly mcguiness drew into the shadow
of a tree and waited he knew this house

as the home of professor xenophon xerxes
zapt inhabited by the old man and his
daughter that open window and the head
rising cautiously over the edge of the porch
roof fitted in with the thoughts mcguiness
had been entertaining he thrust his club
into its loop and felt for his revolver he
was convinced that at last he had been
given his chance to prove himself

  the head kept on rising it was followed
by a crouching body and a pair of legs
it became the figure of a man crawling on
top of the porch toward the open window
with the silent caution of stealth once
it appeared to hesitate to slip on the slant-
ing surface and then it again went on

officer mcguiness had seen
enough he drew his gun and started
at a heavy run for the gate in the fence
before the house and having reached it
he slipped through it without sound he
did not follow the walk but tiptoed with
burly caution over the dampened lawn
made his way quite close to the porch
then and then only did he lift his voice
in a heavy authoritative summons
coom out of ut me poorch-climbin
beauty what are ye doin up there

  for a moment the figure above him went
flat the flirtatious moon peeped out long
enough to reval it sprawled on the rain-
soaked shingles and then in most sur-
prising fashion it floated straight up into
the air

  danny mcguiness stared little by little
while his breath came harshly he tilted
back his head to observe that most amaz-
ing ascent of a human body without ap-
parent means or visible cause

  the man was swimming up as one might
swim in water to judge by the frantic
threshing of his arms and legs but-
danriy had never heard of anyones swim-
ming in the air

  his eyes popped and his jaw dropped
as his intended prisoner mounted twenty
fifty seventy feet and paused seemingly
unable to go any higher the policeman
removed his helmet and scratched his head
the thing wras beyond all precedent of
	famous fantastic mysteries

experience a defiance of natural law a
criminal accosted might vault a fence or
climb a wall or even scale a building in
an effort at escape but to drop on his face
and bounce into the air-and-stay there
like a-like a kite danny put some of his
bewilderment into a baffled mutter

  he went up he mumbled i ask is
ut a man or a flea or a flyin fish devil
take im coom down i says an instead
of realizin th disadvantages of his posi-
tion he rose straight up like a airyplane
an there he is

  and then remembering the dignity of
the law and his own standing as a repre-
sentative of its force he addressed the
figure above him well thats enough
now yer quite a burd to judge by yer
actions but-come on down out of that
and light

  above him the figure was still undergo-
ing contortions beneath the moon and the
broken clouds as he spoke it rolled half-
way over and started like a plummet for
the earth out of it there broke a strangled
exclamation of sheer instinctive terror by
a wild effort it again reversed its position
and once more shot aloft

  up an down said officer mcguiness
yeve foine control an quite a lot of
speed an that was a grand exhibition
but finish th trip next time ive seen
enough of yer tricks

  there followed a breathless interval and
then a gasping response i c-a-a-a-ant 
huh officer mcguiness began to feel
the least bit annoyed he began to enter-
tain a suspicion that this night-hawk was
making sport of a member of the police
at the least he was denying what danny
had actually seen with his own good eyes
ye cant cant ye he remarked at
length well th way ut looked to me ye
started out all right

  yes an if id a kept on you dub id
a broke my neck

  shmall loss an yed had said danny
his anger rising at the other mans form
of address an tis not all noight i hov
to stand here watchin ye act like a
bloomin bat

  whos actin it was a snarl that
answered if you think im doin this for
my health-you got even less sense than th
average cop i tell you-

  thats enough you dont need to tell
me nuthin officer mcguinesss outraged
dignity came to his aid youre under
arrest

  oh am i apparently the man in the
air was inclined to dispute the patrolman

  ye are danny stood by his statement
none the less

  then why dont you come up and get
me

  because i aint no rubber ball it
was a taunt and nothing else and danny
knew it but he didnt know exactly what
to do about it he shifted his position
moving in until he stood close beside the
porch

  it was a most amazing situation he
might call the fire department and get the
extension-tower but that would ruin the
professors lawn he might shoot the de-
fiant captive and yet he doubted if such
action on his part would be considered as
justified there might be a question as to
whether or no a mans floating up in the
air constituted resisting arrest

  he had been taught that an officer
should always keep cool only it was hard
to keep cool in the face of such an amaz-
ing situation once more he scratched his
head and eyed the figure between himself
and the moon the odd thing was the
fellow didnt go any higher or even try to
swim off that was another thing that
danny couldnt understand in fact he
couldnt understand anything that had hap-
pened during the last fifteen minutes the
whole thing was a bit too much for his
brain

  how do you do ut he asked at length

  i dont do it you square-head the
flying man disclaimed all hint at a personal
prowess

  oh dont you a fine scorn crept
into dannys tones then i should loike
to know who does

  i dont know dang it gibbered the
others voice you started it yourself
the gravity experiment



cornin up on me like you did there was
something on the roof i tell you i laid
down in it when you yelled at me i felt
it it was sticky i got it on my clothes-

  on lh roof danny interrupted with
a flash of understanding he knew con-
siderable about xenophon zapt he had
even been mixed up once or twice in his ex-
periments quite outside his own intent

  yes it stuck to me when i laid down
an its keepin me up here i guess if i
lay on my face im all right but i start
failin as soon as i turn on my back heres
some of the danged stuff if you want a
closer look something whistled through
the air and hit the spot where danny had
been standing

  but danny wasnt there as the other
man spoke he had ducked and stepped
aside and straightway he became con-
scious of two things at once the man had
sunk a trifle nearer the earth after throw-
ing down whatever it was he had scraped
from his clothing and-there was some-
thing the matter with his officer mcguin-
esss foot

  it was exhibiting a most remarkable in-
clination to rise into the air despite
dannys efforts to keep it on the ground
it was throwing him off his balance in-
stinctively he hopped sidewise to save him-
self from falling landed his one sane foot
in what might have been a mass of soft
mud on the grass under the eaves of the
porch and became aware that it also had
gone wild

at once officer dan mcguiness
found himself in a most bewildering
rase he had large feet powerful tireless in
the path of duty and the soles of his shoes
were of a large expanse yet strangely
enough now those heavy feet seemed to
have taken on a quality positively airy

  strive as he would they refused to re-
main on the grass in desperation he tried
 step and found himself unable to thrust
either leg or foot downward to a contact
with theearth still struggling against be-
lief he repeated the endeavor with the
other foot and found himself mounting to

the level of the porch roof then and then
only did realization and acceptance of the
situation come upon him

  whu-roo he gave vent to a full-
toned irish shout of comprehension and
continued his progress aloft

  inside the house as that shout woke the
echoes of the night miss zapt pricked her
pretty ears bob she said sharply what
was that

  sounded like a yell or a battle-cry or
something sargent made answer ive
had a notion i heard voices outside for the
past few minutes maybe id better find
out

  he rose and nellie followed him into
the hail he opened the door and they both
stepped out on the porch

  at first they saw nothing and then a
gruff voice drifted to them lie shtill ye
spalpeen ye tould me to come an git ye
an bgob i hov quit yer squirmin or
ill bust yer bean wid me club

  bob miss zapt seized her com-
panions arm she had recognized those
stentorian tones thats officer mc-
guiness they-they must be on the roof
probably sargent went down the
porch steps before he lifted his eyes and
then he too gasped at what he beheld
and his voice came a bit unsteady good
lord nellie look at that

  he lifted an arm and pointed to where
danny treading air very much as a man
treads water was endeavoring to still the
struggles of a human figure sprawled out
weirdly with its face to the earth

  miss zapt took one glance at the spec-
tacle above her and shrieked bob-
theyll be killed

  there came the click of the gate and
a little man with iron-gray whiskers and
a flapping frock-coat came up the walk

  ahem he said rather dryly just what
is the meaning of so excitable a statement
who will be killed may i ask

 officer mcguiness and-somebody
else nellie stammered

  eh professor zapt stared out of his
near-sighted eyes indeed i fail to per-
ceive any indications of an impending


famous fantastic mysteries

tragedy myself where are they

  there once more sargent pointed
aloft

  huh the professor tilted back his
head as bobs arm rose bless my soul
he exclaimed and stared for at least fif-
teen seconds before he raised his voice in
a question officer mcguiness exactly
how did you get up there

  danny may have sensed the presence of
those beneath him but if so he had thus
far given no sign now however he man-
aged to snap tile handcuffs on his man
tilted his head and shot a glance at the
earth

  an is ut you professor he replied
shure an if it is how i got up here yer
askin why i walked though barrin th
fact how i done ut i dunno except that
this poorch-climbin beauty floated offen
yer roof when i told him to come down

i	stepped into somethin on th grass an
then i found mesilf endowed wid th ability
of follerin after belike because of whativer
it was i had got on me fate an tis not
so much how i got up is troublin me now
as how i shall git down wid th burd ive
caught

  remarkable - actually remarkable 
said professor xenophon xerxes zapt
officer this is most amazing let me
think-let me think he made his way

to the porch steps and found himself a
seat

  if lmoight be suggestin sor dont be
thinkin too long at present -dannys
voice came down in the tone of a plaint
 tis tiresome work entirely this walkin
on air tis not an angel i am as yet an
there is nothin to sit on at all at all an
th steady movement is tirin on th legs
then stop it said the other in a man-
ner of impatience keep your feet still
and float he began pulling at his gray-
ing whiskers as though minded to tear
them out by the roots presently he hopped
up trotted a few steps down the walk
lifted his eyes to the laboratory windows
and nodded and then he turned to bob
and nellie did it rain here tonight
it did bob declared

  wind-preceding the shower

  lots of it at first

  that explains it said xenophon
xerxes zapt

  glad of it- bob began

  the professor gave him a glance if
you will kindly let me finish my remarks
as i told you i would i prepared a
quantity of the paste powder the other
day and left it when i departed this morn-
ing to catch a train in my haste i forgot
to close the windows the wind blew the
powder upon the roof and the rain con-

verted it into the paste and washed some
of it off on the lawn-

  if yer quite done thinkin professor
sor officer mcguiness interrupted
would you moind tollin me how to get
down

  eh xenophon zapt jerked up his
head to view the patrolman and his cap-
tive oh yes-yes-certainly thats
simple you have the substance merely on
your feet

  yes sor

  then hold them up

soles of your shoes and let gravity do the
rest robert go turn on the hose that we
may wash the paste off the officers feet
when he reaches the ground hes all
mussed up

  bob departed running on his errand
by the time he was back danny had
effected a landing and was kneeling on the
grass with his captive stretched out on his
back within reach

wtthin five minutes the paste was
removed from mcguinesss feet and
he stood erect

  shure an tis wonderful stuff pro-
fessor he began after he had taken a
deep breath of relief an what moight
you call th same

  zapts repulsive paste said the pro-
fessor it robs anybody above it of
weight

  what do ye think of that now offi-
cer dan exclaimed but tis no more than
th truth yer spakin ive had an example
of its effects myself oh would ye

  he broke off and sprang snatching into
the air to grip and drag back the form of
his prisoner who in the momentary dis-
traction of conversation had managed to
roll himself on his face

  danny slammed him down none too
gently it must be confessed lie there

you can tell a lot about a cigarette by whether it burns fast
or slowly camel cigarettes are noted for their long burning
in fact they burned longer slower than any other brand in
recent scientific tests see right van campen heilner the
famous american authority on wild game points out an inter-
esting angle to this camels give more smoking because they
bum so slowly he says and i think the way they burn is a
very good way to judge the quality of cigarettes too i notice
this about camels-i can smoke them steadily and they still
taste smooth and cool and my mouth feels fresh -not dry -
with no throat irritation camels are mild flavory they give
more genuine pleasure per puff -and more puffs per pack
