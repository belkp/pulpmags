short stories for may out april th
    we read one of those
    justly celebrated little ser-
    mons that go by the name of
    editorials by a great editor of
    a famous weekly magazine the
    other day in which all men were
    divided into four classes as follows

                                 	the useless and tense

                                  	the useless and carefree

     the useful and tense	 the useful and carefree

in which division do you suppose you belong the editorial writer

expressed his preference in the inverse order in which the classes are set
down

     we all of us number among our friends representatives of each division
and what a dull old world it would be if it were not so

    theres division number two what a host of good fellows carefree
happy companions we all know and yet in the stern requirements of this
world they will do very little that is materially worth while-other than add
to its bloomin joie de vie dont expect these souls to accept the respon-
sibilities in the manner you do from their ranks are recruited the
songsters the troubadours the laugh makers-and alas the failures all
too often their irresponsibility is its own reward

     casting aside the matter of personal preference there is of course no
doubt that the fourth class is the smallest for from it are recruited the
worlds greatest men of action-the men who can shoulder the heaviest
responsibilities and still cast off its cares indeed the man or woman is rare
indeed who is blessed with a sense of humor that lasts him in time of stress
such a one is destined for higher places for

                 the thing worth while
                 is to go on with a smile
                 when everything goes dead wrong

modern life

    such a division of humanity is a most significant comment upon the
effect of modern american life nervous tension is here recognized at once
as the greatest factor for accomplishment and the most deadly enemy man
can have it is nervous tension uncontrolled which makes the neuraesthen-
ics and nervous tension controlled which makes the great men dont let
it get you relax seek assume shoulder responsibilities like a man but
keep them under su ection

    a man sump- rhr uole thing up to me the other day when he said
 americans are driven by their jobs the englishmen drive their

  jbs

    we wont go into the matter of whether he was right or wrong or
relative effectiveness here the point is drive your job so you can drive
ahead of it and not be crushed under it

                        h c witwer

    in this issue we have the pleasure of introducing our readers to a writer
new to the pages of short stories and one whose work stands out for its
strong individuality its quick action and frank free open-hearted amer-
icanism this writer is h c witwer whose photograph is reproduced in
the advertisement elsewhere in this issue

    you will read mr witwers novel the skyrocket and judge for
yourself its merits we feel that it is a story which will appeal to every
reader of this magazine mr witwers life has fitted him especially for
writing stories of just this type his youth his enthusiasm and his exuber-
ance have driven him at one time and another from clerical work to the sell-
ing of portable bathtubs from advance agent for a three-ring circus to press
agent for theatres and prizefighters and during one period of stress he was
like john masefield a mixer of drinks witwer though mixed a different
kind of drinks than did the great english poet mr masefield for witwer
was a dispenser of the great american ice cream soda all these things were
interludes in the serious business of life for mr witwer is a newspaper man
at the present time connected with one of the great new york dailies has
spent most of the years of his majority as a reporter and actually put in a
couple of years editing a little florida weekly it was from that experi-
ence he got the idea for his story the skyrocket

some letters

    much as we value all the letters we receive from readers we must con-
fess that there is a certain type of reader whose letters we always study very
carefully that type of reader is the man who is selling magazines and
he has more opportunity to study the likes and dislikes of the magazine
reading public than any one else in the course of a long letter from a man
who has spent many years in the business side of magazine distribution
appeared the following paragraph with reference to short stories do
you agree with him personally we do not incline to serials although we do
have something of a failing for two part stories heres the paragraph
referred to in his letter

     i am a tremendous believer in the circulation building power of novelettes complete
novels and especiajly of serials in big installments running through say four issues  be-
lvc the combination would be a great help to short stories

     wishing you the compliments of the season and increasing prosperity for your maga-
zine  am

                                                         sincerely yours

chapter i

the fuse is lighted

under the blinding glare of the
high-powered calcium lights
the two panting half-naked
men stepped warily around
each other in the limited space
of the twenty-four foot ring the referee
shirt-sleeved perspiring kept pace with
them at a safe distance a frenzied for the
moment bestial thousand or so of adams
descendants rent the smoke-choked air with
coarse deep-throated encouragement ad-
vice and rough but trenchant wit

  the contrast between the two fighters was
typical of the prize ring the one young
clean-cut almost handsome lithe-muscled
and pink-cheeked his swift feints and coun-
ters baffling the eye the other a throw
back from the cave men squat thick-
jowled ungraceful trailing his lighter op-
ponent with ponderous movements of arms
and legs it was boxer and fighter science
against brawn

  on the defensive after six gruelling
rounds his breath fighting its way to the
open from his heaving chest the boxer

wearily retreated to a neutral comer the
other followed relentlessly taking the jar-
ring straight lefts and stinging jabs with
guttural gasps a warning yell from the
boxers admirers a roof-splitting pande-
monium from the fighters followers and
then a huge hairy arm shot out the dull
impact as it found its mark lost in the din
the boxers knees sagged he reeled drunk-
enly his arms mechanically dropping to
protect his stomach

 knock him out horgan shoot it
knock him out

  the crowd leaped from the chairs waving
hats and canes and screaming incoherently
from his box algernon stevens-pitt joy-
ously whacked louie the dip on the
shoulder

  horgan obliged the boxer dropped in a
crumpled heap to the canvas in the par-
lance of the ring he was out cold

  back in the dressing room tommy cran-
dall ex-newspaper man and now on his way
to be ex-prizefighter stared gloomily at the
ceiling as his handlers unwound the ban-
dages from his weary hands he heard
their rough consoling comments abstract-

s


short stories

edly-his swimming brain was slowly fitting
itself back to its normal niche and he was
waiting for the appearance of dan bagley
his manager the suspense was brief for
the door of the dressing room was suddenly
flung open and bagley stood on the thresh-
old a rotund jovial-faced sleek example of
the bromide appearances are ofttimes de-
ceiving a casual glance at bagleys merry
face and you were convinced that here was
good naturedness personified the person
who played santa claus at christmas time
who gave the crippled newsboy the dollar
bill who was the willing prey of the charity
collectors but bagley was known among
his associates as the fox-that was the
kindest name they called him it had been
said that he could give the late j p morgan
cards and spades and beat him roundly at
any deal involving dollars and cents that
he wouldnt give a blind man a copper with-
out taking four out of the cup and that he
never backed a loser in his life

  it was this last that crandall was thinking
of when bagley entered the room and stood
regarding him with a fat black cigar stuck at
a truculent angle in his mouth bagley
wasted little time in coming to the nature
of his visit his first word was to the
handlers

  outside for yours he grunted

  they obeyed the command with com-
mendable alacrity and crandall and his
manager were alone bagley laboriously
sat down on a backless chair in the corner
of the room he drew a roll of bills from
his pocket and handed it to crandall with a
great show of ceremony crandall took the
money and tucked it carelessly in a pocket
of his trousers continuing the lacing of his
shoes bagley abruptly removed the cigar
from his mouth and considered the end of
it pensively

  tommy he began clearing his throat
vigorously i guess you and me are through
after to-night you better go back to the
newspaper game or some other graft where
you can use your head instead of your
hands i cant afford to carry no deadheads
on my staff and when you let a tramp like
horgan stop you-you dont belong get
me you carry your best stuff between
your hat and your collar-it ought to be be-
tween your shoulder and your hand why

this guy hit you with everything bu
bucket to-night he grunted disgust
say you should a heard what them nt
paper guys said he rose chewing on
cigar well im sorry but its for th
good of us both youll find five hundre
dollars in that roll i slipped you thatll kee
the dogs away until you plant yourse
somewheres so long and he was gone

  for a good five minutes after bagley lef
the dressing room crandall contemplat
the floor it was only when the special
policeman attached to the club put his head
in the door and inquired as to whether
there was glue on the chair that crandall
pulled himself together finished dressing
and left the building

  the street was all but deserted when
crandall reached the open he gratefully
inhaled the cold night air in deep draughts
as he stood undecided outside the arena
well he was done at last two months ago
the mention of his name aroused animated
discussion wherever sporting men fore-
gathered it was a rare day that at least
half a column of his exploits in the squared
circle did not find its way into the news-
papers he had steadily forged his way
to a point so near the coveted laurels that
he could have almost reached out a mus-
cular arm and touched the honors awaiting
him his swift rise had earned him the
sobriquet of the skyrocket and then
-what was it his nerve he sneered
at the unoffending lamp post why he had
given some of them twenty-five pounds and
whipped them his skill hardly he
had a decision over the runner up for the
title but to-night was but a repetition of
his last few fights and now horgan at best
a good second rater had knocked him out
in seven rounds he shuddered involun-
tarily

  crandall took the roll of bills from his
pocket and looked at it quizzically he
would have one rip-roaring session and
then-well hed take that up later no
more rigorous training banned cigarettes
and guarded diet-he was free his time
and pleasure were his own not bagleys
the contemplation braced him like a stimu-
lant his head was erect and his shoulders
well back as he strode briskly down the
street
the skyrocket



     first port of call was mcdermotts
he was no stranger there when
brawny form pushed through the swing-
 doors the bartender who saw him first
ached for the seltzer siphon and filled the
alls basking in the reflected glory of serv-
ng the coming champion crandalls
trongest tipple in those days was a lemon
and seltzer and he smiled grimly as he
pushed through the doors this time in an-
ticipation of the sensation his order for
whisky straight would provoke

  and then it was that fate glancing down
at crandall from the maze of human desti-
nies flicked the wheel of fortune so that the
little ball would roll in the lucky pocket
mayhap it was because fate being fem-
inine admired the boyish cleft to crandalls
firm chin or perhaps it was because the
more fortunate are given a second try if
they fumble the first chance at any rate
it was jimmy lane sporting writer of the
press who was selected as fates ambassa-
dor to crandalls court of misfortune

  lane from his table in the rear grasped
the significance of crandalls entrance with
quick intuition and with a hasty apology to
his party he rose and came toward him
crandall leaning over the bar had given
his order when lane slapped him on the
back

  hello there tommy he said cheer-
fully

  hello jimmy what are you drinking
crandall responded with forced gayety

  me ill have a little ginger ale say
youre not going to drink that are you
he pointed to the whisky bottle in front of
crandall

  oh no crandall retorted im going
to use it for a mouth wash they tell me
its very sanitary he poured a stiff drink

well heres-

  wait a minute old man lane grasped
his uplifted arm with the privilege of long
friendship put that down and let me tell
you something-no not a temperance es-
say catching the others sneer just leave
it there a minute

  crandall slowly replaced the untasted
drink with a growling

  well what is it

  say tommy lane began listen-i
saw the fight to-night-i know how you feel

i met bagley afterward and he told me
about the other too hes a rat dont let
him get your nerve but dont start fighting
that stuff until you hear my proposition
then if you want to cut loose ill help
you

  crandall stared down at lane for a mo-
ment tapping nervously on the polished bar
with his fingers

  whats the scheme he asked finally

  come on in the back here lane
tugged at his coat this is deep stuff
cant let it be overheard he winked
humorously come on ill tell you all
about it

  mildly protesting crandall allowed him-
self to be led to the rear of the cafe and
arriving at the table indicated by lane he
sat down with his back to the entrance half
screened from the curious lane called a
hovering waiter and ordered a pint of ap-
polinaris to crandalls audible disgust

  say he said abruptly turning to lane
you were always a sharp on psychology
and stuff like that why are these dubs
trimming me

  thats just exactly what im here to tell
you exclaimed lane not only that im
going to prove my reason to you do you
know whos responsible for the fox pass
as we say at the club that you made to-
night kid imagination title holder at
all weights

  crandalls look of interest was unfeigned

  ill elucidate continued lane you
get in the ring with one of these second
raters and before the bell rings for the first
round youve got him licked kid imag-
ination sketches him for you stretched cold
on the canvas you hear the crowd yelling
for you and all the rest of it bang goes
the bell you leap to your feet and start
jabbing this fellow kid imagination is
sparring for time the other fellow maybe
gets a lucky punch over and it shakes you
up kid imagination is getting set for the
sleep producer while youre dancing
around the ring keeping this other fellow
off your brain is forming this that last
wallop was a peach it shook me up-one
of those on the chin would take me off my
feet-two of them would knock me out
ive heard of fighters being killed with a
wallop like that over the heart id better


short stories

be careful thats the way old kid imag-
ination slips over his wallop you got your
ring training at school and you told me you
had a year at college training for a
fighter-never

  how about the other fellow crandall
asked with half amused interest doesnt
your theory work both ways

  no lane slapped his hand on the
table take a man like horgan for in-
stance do you know what he thinks when
hes in the ring ill tell you he doesnt
think when you sting him hes come
back at you before his slow moving brain
has had time to form pictures-and it
couldnt form any if it had those fellows
have been beaten to a pulp so often that
their body is dulled to pain their training
for the ring has been gotten on the lots in
the hell holes of the east side where a
finish fight is a days incident and the only
thing to remember is that the man who
goes down loses you know that if you hit
the other fellow enough times and get away
from his counters youll get the referees
decision he knows that if he hits you
once in the right place the referee wont
need to give a decision

  crandall reached for the appolinaris
there may be something in that
jimmy he said slowly

  of course theres something in it cried
lane banging the table with his fist why
do you suppose the police force is com-
posed chiefly of aliens who have been here
only long enough to get citizenship papers
and whose chief assets are heft and brawn
ill tell you i walk along the street in some
disreputable part of the town i hear a
yell from a darkened doorway i say to
myself id like to help that fellow but
that place is dark and there may be a man
with a knife or is it a gang of gunmen-

or- i go away from there all right

now one of these cops comes along he
hears the same yell under the same con-
ditions does he stop and temporize on his
possible fate if he interferes he does
not he draws his nightstick and plunges in
why is he made of sterner stuff than i
not a bit of it he has one asset i have
not-a negative one-the lack of imagina-
tion if he stopped to think rnd could
think-he wouldnt go in either

   well thats all very interesting jim
remarked crandall after a pause b
fail to see where it will get me anyth
now

  wait lane leaned over impressivel
if i tip you off to a sure thing will yc
promise me to stay out of the ring untf
youve given it a whirl

  what is it crandalls query was list-
less the mention of the word ring had
brought him back from a contemplation of
lanes theory to the stern and immediate
present

  you were a pretty fair newspaper man
before you got into this infernal fight
game lane began seriously i can get
you a mans size job away from new york
that will pay you a good salary and give you
a chance to make good with a capital g
i will get you this job if youll promise to
leave the booze alone and follow directions

   ive come to that stage already have 
said crandall half angrily if im a good
boy and so forth-

   not at all not at all lane hastened to
interrupt im offering you a chance that
you would have leaped at a year ago i
know fifty good men who would snap at it
now its your game-working with your
head instead of your hands why not give
it a whirl anyway if you dont like it
come back and put the gloves on again
this job will take you to the open country
and you can keep in active training all the
time

  where is this place crandall asked
with a show of returning interest

  in florida-on the edge of the ever-
glades but i want to know if youll take a
chance with these people before i go any
further

  crandall regarded his empty glass as if
reading his horoscope in the curved crystal

   ill take one if they will he said finally

  good lane enthusiastically grasped
his hand here he searched his pock-
ets and pulled forth a card go up and
see this fellow to-morrow morning at ten
tell him i sent you ill write him a letter
to-night and hell have read it when you
get there he wants a good man badly

  lane leaned back as if the matter were
now settled and he rubbed his hands to-
gether with a satisfied air crandall filled
the skyrocket



  s glass with the mineral water turning a
arcastic smile on lane

  i think he said it might be a good
idea to tell me now whether  have agreed
to enter a plan to dynamite the woolworth
building or whether the scheme is merely
to assassinate the president not that i
have any squeamish scruples only  would
like to know if youll pardon my unnatural
curiosity what this job is

  lane laughed and pulled his chair closer
to the table

  calm yourself tommy he said this
man im sending you to see to-morrow is at
the head of a big land company hes an
ex-united states senator by the way his
company has bought a large tract of land
down in florida-a sort of pine forest i
believe it was well theyve cleared away
the pines and cut the ground up into lots
in something like a month i believe after
their literature flooded the mails a coiony
has sprung up which they hope to develop
into a regular sized hustling town theyve
planted a newspaper there also-it has a
circulation all over the country and acts as
the medium or silent salesman that brings
people down there they want a live one
to run the paper which is without a pilot
now there you are

 sounds like a come-on scheme to me
crandall said looking fixedly at lane

 youre crazy lane retorted indig-
nantly why this man he pointed to the
ard in crandalls hand is a philanthro-
pist hes given thousands to charity his
idea is to make this place a colony for in-
valids all over the country - people who
havent money enough to go to sanitariums
nd fancy health resorts he sells them
hese lots at an absurdly low figure-makes
hem buy so they wont feel objects of
charity why man hes worked on this
scheme for years

  well said crandall rising ill go up
in the morning and see him thanks for
the tip jimmy

  they parted at the door

chapter ii

the turning point

  crandalls descent in the squared circle
had been matched only by his rise they

were more than rapid they were breath
taking it had begun a year ago when he
was a reporter on the press as a news-
paper man crandall while he may not have
reached the spectacular heights he attained
in the ring was well thought of by his city
editor his tremendous bulk had swept
him past many a guardian of the big mens
gates and once inside crandall knew how
to capture the elusive interview and bear it
to the local room for the first edition he
was jogging along at forty dollars a week
until griggs his city editor had selected
him to call on kid oneill the middle-
weight champion and put the kids exploits
and ambitions into a column for the red-
blooded readers of the press

  he had handled his assignment well but
that was only a minor detail he made a
favorable impression with the kids hand-
lers and bagley his manager had viewed
him with joy he became thereafter a
frequent visitor to the kids quarters and
in a brief space the inevitable happened
bagley proved inordinately adept at weigh-
ing a niggardly forty dollars a week against
a possible  a fight crandall being
young and human succumbed

  the sporting writers hailed his first ap-
pearance as a fighter with unmeasured de-
light first because he stopped his man
in a round and second because he was
something of a rarity in his profession he
used perfect english and dressed like a
gentleman many a special story with
crandall the adonis of the prize ring
was passed by a jaded sunday editor for a
long time following that night under the
skillful tutelage of bagley crandall went
along knocking out third then second-
raters with monotonous regularity then
came his descent-the climax of which was
reached when bagley disgusted with his
favorites poor showing in several disas-
trous bouts with second-raters had cut him
adrift

  success had brought carelessness with it
the rigorous training grew irksome to
crandall who longed for the free and easy
life of the reporter and he had climbed
into the ring one night with a small but
dangerous roll of fat the bane of all ath-
letes showing over the edge of his trunks
his opponent an unsung graduate from the


short stories

pork and beans ranks had gained fame on
that occasion by giving crandall an un-
merciful beating and all but knocking him
out crandalls desire to save his features
and his inability to finish his battle-scarred
opponent had cost him dearly for the first
time in his whirlwind career he had emerged
from the ring a gory battered loser that
was the beginning crandall was no cow-
ard but he refused to take the reckless
chances with his next opponents that had
endeared him to followers of the game in
the past he gave more attention to the art
of defence than the knack of attack his
powers as a drawing card soon waned be-
cause votaries of the manly art cannot get
the requisite thrill from an exhibition of
science though they protest to the contrary
that comes with the smashing blows and
gory exchanges that follow when fighters
meet

  it lacked but a few minutes to ten the
next morning when crandall presented his
card at the offices of the osceola land com-
pany and consulting the card lane had
given him asked for george h hermance
general manager as the office boy with
an admiring glance at his bulk stepped into
the inner office with his card crandall ex-
perienced a sudden thrill and became con-
scious that his hands were at least four
sizes too large and that he should have
worn his gray morning suit inwardly he
heartily sympathized with st anthony be-
cause a direct descendant of the tempt-
resses of that pious man was sitting less
than three feet away studying his mam-
moth form with frank interest despite his
effort to control his fascinated eyes they
persisted in glueing themselves on the girl
who appeared totally unembarrassed by his
gaze which she returned with interest ap-
praising him coolly from head to toe it
was the office boy who brought him back
to earth

  say cant ya hear the boy tugged
at his coat do you wanna see the boss or
dont ya he snorted indignantly

  the girl laughed evidently enjoying his
discomfiture as crandall hurriedly stumbled
after the boy into the general managers
office

  hermance ex-tjnited states senator
head of the osceola and other companies

and prey of the sherman law was hare
the ideal type of philanthropist physically
crandall thought he looked as bagley his
erstwhile manager would have looked had
he been a product of wall street instead of
third avenue he had the same rotund
form-but his face resembled the hawk
more than the dove and his cold gray eyes
peered out at the world from the shelter of
brows that overhung with the rugged ap-
pearance of mountain crags he looked up
quickly from a handful of correspondence
as crandall entered

  you mr crandall he shot out ab-
ruptly

  yes sir crandall answered standing
at his desk

  know anything about florida

  well a little crandall began i-

  no matter-heres a chance for you to
increase your knowledge and possibly your
prospects broke in hermance with an
impatient wave of his hand he reached
into a pigoeonhole of the desk and pulled
out a letter i have your-er-pedigree
here he said lane tell you what the
job is

  he sketched it crandall answered
adopting the others manner

  hermance amiably allowed a grunt to
escape him

  i want a man to run a paper there-
boom town-growing fast plant is there
now ready for business towns called
ocean breeze now get a better name later
fifty dollars a week yes or no
yes crandalls answer came on top
of the others last word

  good ejaculated hermance plainly
pleased at crandalls ready acceptance
hope you always think as quickly as that
all right he wrote hurriedly on a pa
and tore off a strip of paper heres an
order for some money go find my cashier
boy will show you youll get a letter of in-
structions from me when you arrive-prin-
cipal thing now is to get there ive known
lanes father for forty years so im gam-
bling on you from his sons tip he rose
and held out a flabby hand hope you
make good he finished surveying cran-
dall keenly you look like a fighter
theres some difference of opinion
about that smiled crandall shaking the
the skyrocket



  ners hand good-bye mr hermance
  nd thank you

  crandall stepped into the outer office
glancing around expectantly but the vision
who had enthralled him at his entrance was
gone and he found himself half wondering
whether he had really observed her or not
he called to the boy and asked to be di-
rected to the cashiers office and as the
youth obligingly led the way he stopped
him and bent down to his ear

  who was the lady who was sitting here
a moment ago he asked the mystified
youngster

 heh oh search me she was some
queen eh the boy smiled knowingly
say aint you tommy crandall the
fighter he asked abruptly

  crandall ashamed of his own curiosity
glanced fearsomely at the door to the gen-
eral managers office

  no certainly not he said where
did you say i could find the cashier

 come on ill show you the boy
turned disappointedly shooting covert
glances over his shoulder at crandall until
the latter was ushered in the cashiers
office

  a half hour later crandall left the offices
of the osceola land company with one
hundred dollars added to the roll he already
carried and a bundle of many colored lit-
erature setting forth the delights of florida
in general and ocean breeze in particular
under his arm his first thought was to in-
form lane of his good fortune which he
did by telephone the delighted jimmy
promising to meet him at the railroad sta-
tion at nine that night

  after giving some consideration to the
subject over his lunch crandall decided
that for various good reasons it would be
hetter not to eliminate the fond farewells
to lane there were few others that mat-
tered so he hurried to his quarters spent
an hour or two in packing and checking
his suit case at the station spent the re-
mainder of the afternoon at a vaudeville
show

  lane was at the depot to bid him good-
bye that night and the two sat in the
smoking car of the florida limited and
talked of many things until the conductors
warning shout

chapter iii

the start of the flight

  crandall stood on the ramshackle plat-
form and gazed at the battered sign over
the station with some difficulty he made
out the letters spelled ocean breeze as
far as he could see the place was abso-
lutely deserted save for himself and he
shivered as the cold biting rain drove him
to the shelter of the waiting room doorway
tired and depressed after the long dusty
ride in the train he had been dumped off
here in the midst of a furious rain storm
all he could observe when he dared a duck-
ing and stood at the edge of the platform
was a long wide strip of sand churned up
here and there by the downpour cold and
inhospitable looking occasionally a fringe
of palmetto broke the drab outlook and the
muddy flapping objects swaying with the
wind he perceived to be tents when the
haze lifted for a moment he saw at rare
intervals a one-story frame house evi-
dently thrown up hurriedly with no regard
to beauty and little to stability he thought
of his comfortable quarters in new york
and sighed deeply the bunch were prob-
ably settling for the afternoon session at
mcdermotts about this time maybe bag-
ley had repented his hastiness and was
hunting for him frantically at the thought
of the ponderous bagley hunting frantic-
ally for anything he chuckled involuntarily
and found his spirits reviving somewhat so
he walked the length of the platform and
pressed against the door to the inner
regions

  he found himself in a long narrow com-
partment piled high with freight of sundry
description two little spaces walled off
from the rest of the room greeted his eye
over one scrawled in chalk heread wait-
ing room white over the other wait-
ing room colored as he turned musing
over the distinction a third compartment
met his gaze it differed from the others
in that it had a little wire-framed opening in
the front a pair of enormous feet clad in
congress gaiters protruded from the aper-
ture completely blocking off the view in-
side the owner of the heroic pedal ex-
tremities gave no sign that he had observed
crandalls entrance and crandall guessed


short stories

that owing to the wind and rain beating
down on the tin-roofed top of the station
like a battery of machine guns his pres-
ence was unnoticed he strode forward
until he stood in front of the little window

  you seem to be having plenty of both
ocean and breeze here to-day he said
pleasantly addressing the feet

  the effect was instantaneous the feet
came down from the window with a bang
and the owner stood up he was a match
for crandall in height but not bulk his long
tapering body surmounted by a peaked and
bony face what seemed to be a fixed ex-
pression of suspicion rested on his features

  how did you git in here he inquired
drawlingly after a comprehensive survey
of the dripping crandall

  crandall laughed shaking the water from
his cap

  via the well-known southern railway
he answered though it is not their fault
is this the usual weather down here

  did you all git in here on eighty-five
persisted the other

  i got in here on that last train an-
swered crandall nettled at the examination
you didnt think i was blown in on the
storm did you do you know where i can
find quarters around here

  if i knowed where you all could find
quarters id be lookin for em myself
the other rejoined unsmilingly i cant
tell you whereabouts you can find quarters
or halves or dimes or anything else round
about here bout the onliest thing you all
will find and you wont have to hunt for it
is pneumonia and malaria

  well youre a cheerful host you are
crandall laughed in spite of himself
but say im soaking wet-isnt there a
boarding house or a hotel or something like
that here

  what you all fixin to do down here
answered the other seating himself com-
fortably

  look here you infernal idiot crandall
exclaimed angrily im not going to answer
any more questions get that i want to

get somewhere and change my clothes-

  the other seemed not at all disturbed by
his outburst he pondered solemnly a mo-
ment balancing back on his chair

  w-e- he said finally i reckon you

can find a place to sleep at mrs san
worths she was tellin me this mornii
she had a empty room there but thats 
right smart stretch from here aint nobody
cornin in here no more to-day you can
open that there grip sack you got and
change your duds right here

  after a moments hesitation crandall ac-
cepted the suggestion and retiring to a cor-
ner of the room hurriedly divested himself
of his dripping clothing he flung open his
suit case thanking his stars for the good
sense that had made him pack an old suit
of clothes where it was now available his
trunk had been hurled off the train and was
standing on the platform in the rain at
the thought he turned to the other

  say my trunk is out there on the plat-
form will you help me get it inside

  oh thats what that is the man got
up lazily from the chair why i thought
that was a deadhead belongin to the agent
that id been looking for i just stick my
hand out this little hole here on stormy
days he illustrated his meaning get my
invoices without stirrin from this little ole
chair i guess thats the reason i didnt see
you all get off 

  crandall made no rejoinder but finished
his dressing the other noted his brawny
chest and rippling back and shoulder
muscles with unconcealed admiration

  you all set up like a prize fighter mis-
ter he blurted suddenly

  crandall grinned buttoning his collar
well i hope you wont hold that against
me he said whats your name
mines crandall

  crandall crandall repeated the other
never heard that one before where do
you all come from

  new york answered crandall

  hmph the other grunted les see
thats away up north aint it i been as
far north as vicksburg once but i never

have got to that new york place-

  yes but whats your name crandall
interrupted

  me oh im thad newell first assist-
ant to the agent here-got first call on the
job too

  well im pleased to meet you mr new-
ell crandall said holding out his hand
much obliged returned the other sol-
the skyrocket



  nly grasping it with his own only just
ill me plain thad we dont call nobody
rtister round here ceptin were mad at
em

  all right thad crandall assured him
ill try and remember that better call me
tommy then too

  speakin bout these yere prize fighters
went on newell we got a no good houn
down here that allows hes some shakes at
that sport thats sam bass sams just
a poor worthless cracker as far as mos
everything is concerned ceptin one thing
-thats fightin sams a regular whang
dingus at that and if you rub him the wrong
way hell most closely do you up

  ill watch out for sam then crandall
replied but tell me something about this
place-whats the present population

  we got bout a thousand here now
newell answered speculatively they
head for this little ole town from all over the
united states and theyre cornin in every
day this was the most no account day in
quite a spell-you bein the onliest one to
git yere on  some northern land com-
panys runnin things and so far things seem
all right but theres a heap sight more real
estate agents here than they ought to be
seems like they come down yere to be sure
enough citizens and after the first day they
just naturally become real estate agents
sign painter does more business than any
one else in the town

  how is order maintained in a place like
this asked crandall must be pretty
wild isnt it

  nope its tame enough newell an-
swered thoughtfully they aint nobody
gettin killed ceptin by the fever maybe
or somethin and you all can leave your
hams and fixins out at night and find them
there in the mornin without some of these
here niggers gets em theres mostly old
folks and sick ones here and they dont
make much trouble that no account sam
bass gets rampagious now and again but
we got a pretty good sheriff over in kissim-
mee and he looks after things

  has this northern land company got an
office here crandall inquired on the
verge of telling newell his business there

   they got a little ole wooden shack down
by the lake newell- replied frowning

ludicrously which houses two of the pert-
est young snips i ever run across a couple
of these here writin machines and a lot of
fool books about ocean breeze these
here pair of grampuses registers sales of
lots half the day and the other half they
stand around yere tellin each other what a
terrible no account ol hole ocean breeze is
alongside of new york

  crandall thought over this information in
silence for a moment and then his ear de-
tecting a let up in the steady downpour he
walked to the little window and looked out
a terrific gust of wind swept by the station
rocking it dangerously and as crandall
looked he saw a long frame building almost
on a line with his vision careen crazily
over and topple to the ground with a mighty
crash attracted by the noise newell
stepped quickly to his side

  hmph another one gone he com-
mented viewing the ruins these here
northerners better get that concrete down
yere right soon or there wont be none of
their offices left

  what was that place crandall asked
idly staring at the pile of lumber and
broken glass

  that oh that was the newspaper of-
fice newell answered contemptuously

chapter iv

the first clash

  the rebuilding of the tribune office was
a slow and laborious job but crandall at
length completed it to his satisfaction
tarpaulins flung over the press and the type
cases had saved them from a total loss and
going out to the lumber camp a mile from
the town crandall had engaged a motley
collection of laborers to help him with the
task he wrote a long letter to hermance
detailing his experiences and the partial loss
of the building a wire in return had in-
structed him to have a temporary structure
built at once pending the arrival of the
concrete for the permanent home of the
tribune during the reconstruction process
crandall engaged an old negro known only
as jim who had become so attached to
him in a week that a dog would seem faith-
less by comparison jim constituted himself
as self-appointed bodyguard to crandall and


short stories

it was with difficulty that the latter could
go any place without the faithful jim jog-
ging along within easy hailing distance in
the rear

  the newspaper force consisted of three
girl compositors who required one hour be-
tween them to set a stick of type one
devil by name dudie wallace who made
his first name a mockery by his dress and
whose ability to sleep standing up was his
only one and one general all-around printer
which to the initiated tells it all dave hark-
ness harkness was in crandalls estima-
tion the most skilled craftsman he had ever
known he fairly radiated efficiency like
all geniuses he had a weakness-his par-
ticular one being an infatuation for john
barleycorn that in itself would have been
bad but harkness was never known to ex-
ceed his capacity on any but one day-the
day the tribune went to press

  crandalls first visit to the osceola land
companys official agency had not been
pleasant the day after the printing office
had blown down he had gone there to get
acquainted with his business associates as
suggested in the letter of instructions her-
mance had sent him from new york he
found the office occupied by two youths at-
tired in gorgeous raiment and smoking
cheap cigarettes they received him with
a cold respectfulness induced by his bulk
he learned that one was harold gordon
stillman nephew of hermance and his of-
ficial representative at ocean breeze the
other languidly permitted himself to be in-
troduced as arthur butts-blythe of new-
port and new york friend of the mighty
harold and an apparent under secretary of
the firms his request for information
was answered by airy waves of beautifully
manicured hands to the little piles of litera-
ture describing the alleged delights of
ocean breeze strewn about the office
crandall spent little time there then or
thereafter

  finding that most of the colonists were
living in tents pending the arrival of lum-
ber to construct their homes crandall
engaged board at the largest and most pre-
tentious of the frame structures already
erected the villa lorraine the villa lor-
raine was like the grand palace hotel
which has a branch in every small town

throughout the west it looked as little 
its name as possible it was a low-lyiii
frame building one story high with win
dows placed at the more favorable junc-
tures a laudable attempt at a piazza ran
around it in front and rear with an opening
in the front for entrance the villa was
under the able management of laura and
bella havens who had come all the way
from montana to enjoy the life-giving air
of florida as set forth in the companys
literature and incidentally to increase their
fortunes by feeding the populace

  the majority of the younger element of
the town attracted by the romance of the
two girls venture boarded at the villa
some of the older ones came too attracted
by the savory odors of their kitchen it was
an odd enough company that sat down at
the long pine board tables each meal time
besides many of the lumber camp em-
ployees there was wills an anaemic clerk
who had journeyed from boston to regain
something he never had to lose ainsworth
a foreman at the lumber camp who had
an inordinate appetite for hominy grits
he called it  mr simms a veteran of the
civil war obsessed with the fear that the
fact would be forgotten despite his g a r
medals olin vincent a young merchant
and the redoubtable sam bass

  crandall with the assistance of the faith-
ful and ever present jim had built himself
sleeping quarters in the newspaper office
by constructing a sort of loft over the press
it enabled him to stay up late at night in an
effort to master the intricacies of getting
out the tribune every friday and was
equally conducive to early rising

  after the first two weeks in his new habi-
tat he found that he had gained a few
pounds around the waist line that in former
days would have been dangerous nd that
there were hotter places than broadway in
mid-august but aside from this his mode
of living had suffered slight change it was
hard getting accustomed to the interminable
stretches of sand palm and palmetto and
the food at the villa lorraine while clean
and undoubtedly wholesome had the draw-
back of eternal sameness the predominat-
ing motive of each meal was grits he
also discovered that by burning a weird
smelling punk at night he could persuade
the skyrocket



  e of the multitudinous flying insects to
nain at a respectful distance from his cot
crandall paid frequent visits to the now
nore genial thad newell at the railroad
station and the two were on the verge of
becoming fast friends when an incident oc-
curred that took them over the verge and
astingly cemented the friendship cran-
dall hurrying to the station one morning of
press day in expectation of the arrival of
a new chase came upon dave harkness
and sam bass sprawled under a pine tree
in the sand their arms were lovingly twined
about each others neck and it required no
practiced eye to see that both were exceed-
ingly under the influence of something
stronger than the boiling florida sun
crandall stopped and stared at the pair with
anger kindling in his eyes he had prided
himself that he had got harkness to a point
of loyalty to the paper and himself where
he would forego the cheering cup until after
press day at least this much harkness had
sworn with many strange oaths only the
night before

  get up dave crandall sharply com-
manded harkness glowering at the pair

  harkness with drunken truculence flour-
ished an empty whisky flask

  aint goin to move he retorted bel-
ligerently looking at crandall with watery
eyes i aint nobodys slave im dave
harkness best little ole printer in seven
states and nine counties i aint goin to let
no northern squirt come down here an
hustle me around no sir

  bass chuckled a sneering approval
thats pourin it into him dave he
said with a defiant appraisal of crandall
some people gettin pretty slick around
yere tryin to tell us crackers what to do
cant tell a cracker nothin a crackers his
own rss you all best keep goin where
youre bound

  he arose with some difficulty leering at
crandall

  crandall noticed that two or three idlers
had drawn near and that thad newell was
standing by the station steps beckoning to
him warningly the train was whistling for
the station he pushed impatiently at bass
and as the latter stumbled to one side
stooped over and dragged the protesting
harkness to his feet

  come on now dave he commanded
shaking him heres the train youve got
to help me with this chase  want you to
see if its the one we ordered-weve got to
go to press this afternoon too-

  he felt a heavy arm on his shoulder

  take your hands offen him bass
seemingly miraculously sober drawled the
words out insolently

   dont want to have any trouble with
you bass crandall said quietly enough
although his muscles were twitching and his
face had paled slightly but  warn you to
keep out of this-if you dont youll get
hurt

  he shook off the others arm and stooped
over harkness who had slumped back-
again in the sand

  the clanging rattle of the old wood-
burning train pulling into the station
drowned newells warning yell yet from in-
stinctive caution crandall veered his body
to one side his act broke the force of
basss wild swing but the power of the
glancing blow upset his balance and sent
him sprawling in the sand

  basss triumphant chuckle was chorused
by the fringe of idlers now swelled by the
first of the detraining passengers it was
not alone the attack but the laugh that fol-
lowed that tore the restraining clutch from
crandalls seething emotions he leaped
quickly to his feet buttoning his light coat
tightly as he rose so that his arms would be
unimpeded the scattering spectators had
now become a fair-sized mob drawn by the
potent magnet of give and take combat
half a score of teamsters en route to the
station had lost interest in the commercial
pursuit at the prospect of the fight and
stood straining eagerly over the press from
the vantage of their wagon tops crandall
dashed their fond hopes however although
the dashing amply repaid many once more
tommy crandall candidate for the heavy-
weight title he faced bass on his toes and
moving his head a fraction of an inch es-
caped a bone-crushing swing as bass car-
ried forward by the futile effort stumbled
past him crandall stepped in and brought
his right up in a beautiful uppercut that
lifted bass an inch from the ground he
fell forward on his face in the sand-inert

  the crowd at first failed to realize that


short stories

the fight was over so swiftly had it come to
an end and amid the confused babble as
they milled forward to view the prostrate
bass crandall slipped through the press
which made a respectful way for him as he
shouldered his way along and continued to
the station newell came forward to meet
him slapping him heartily on the shoulder

  thats the bestest thing i seen in ten
years he declared with the first and only
show of enthusiasm crandall had ever seen
him display if that there houn makes a
face at me any more ill most closely tend
to him that cracker talked so much bout
what he could do i thought he was a fightin
fool now i see it can be done hed best
keep quiet when hes around me

  crandalls laughing rejoinder died on the
tip of his tongue looking past newell he
had seen something that sent the blood ting-
ling through his body with a sensation he
had known but once before that was in
the new york office of hermance before he
had been engaged to come to ocean breeze
he knew the other was saying something
saw the curious look on his face-and he
strode forward so swiftly that he almost
brushed the indignant newell off his feet
he did not stop until he was facing the rea-
son of his quick coming breath the girl who
had laughed at him in hermances office

  she was talking to the conductor of the
train when he had first espied her and now
she stood in front of him with dawning rec-
ognition in her eyes he doffed his cap
and catching the quick glint of annoyance
at his fascinated stare addressed her

  i-i beg your pardon-i thought i had
seen you before-i mean i knew i had seen
you-i-i-

  floundering hopelessly he fumbled in
lhe pockets of his coat and produced a note
book and lead pencil the girl watched
him tightening her lips to restrain the smile

  im the editor of the newspaper here
crandall went on hurriedly and part of
my-er-duties is to interview the new ar-
rivals eh-what do you think of ocean
breeze 

  i see you inculcate your editorials with
vour fists the girl laughed merrily break-
ing the tension-for crandall at least
was that a rival journalist or merely a
rebellious subscriber

  that was neither responded cram
recovering his poise slowly that was
accident may i have your name he i
dicated his note book with a great show o
business-like indifference i am not pre-
suming-it is quite regular he added

  the girl waved over his shoulder anc
crandall turning annoyed at the interrup-
tion saw laura havens of the villa lor-
raine approaching with a welcoming smile
on her face he stepped aside as the girl
made to pass him

  oh you might say she said mischiev-
ously that miss janet doe arrived from
new york this morning and thinks ocean
breeze is perfectly beautiful she is es-
pecially impressed by the conclusive editor-
ials in the-bugle i suppose it is-and the
genial editors method of impressing them
on his subscribers

  crandall took a half step forward hoping
that his boarding mistress would introduce
him but the hope was dispelled when both
turned their backs on him and started for
the villa conversing animatedly so he
consoled himself with the thought that he
would necessarily meet her at lunch and he
suddenly decided he was extraordinarily
hungry

  he rejoined newell who was laboriously
checking off freight from a handful of in-
voices

  that there printin thing you all was
lookin for has come vouchsafed the lat-
ter glancing up you all didnt waste no
time shinin up to that new citizen-did
you well she is certainly some whang
dingus for looks

  you bet she is crandall rejoined feel-
ingly

  yep newell went on checking up his
invoices and im satisfied theres goin to
be some lively doins in this little o town
from now on

  why now asked crandall

  well newell answered thoughtfully
shes goin to look just as good to all these
here young romeos as she did to you all

chapter v

a close call

  when crandall entered the dining room
of the villa lorraine he found the girl in-
the skyrocket



   ed at the head of the table listening to
graphic account of the battle of gettys-
urg as fought by mr simms with the as-
istance of the contending armies although
visibly annoyed by the interruption mr
simms had the grace to introduce him-
which he did very ceremoniously as our
young and enterprising editor the girl
arose and bowed politely and if she hadnt
turned that radiant smile on him crandall
might have caught her name as mr simms
mumbled it but after murmuring an inane
commonplace he took his seat at the table
and it was not until he had consumed two
helpings of hominy which he heartily de-
tested and caught the indignant glances
from his fellow boarders at his sudden dis-
play of gluttony that he recovered his com-
posure timing himself so as to rise before
the others he made for the kitchen and
learned from the sympathetic laura that the
latest addition to the attractions of ocean
breeze was miss dorothy stevenson of
new york an old schoolmate of the havens
girls she was there on an indefinite vist
as the guest of the villa lorraine upon
asking more complete information cran-
dall found that lauras loquaciousness grew
less marked so he took the hint and de-
sisted

 returning to the dining room crandall
made several ineffectual attempts to draw
the girl into conversation but finally he
gave it up for the time and went back to
the printing office

 with the assistance of dudie and his
girl compositors he managed to get the
paper to press about eight that night after
which he detailed dudie to the task of
rounding up the erratic harkness then
worn out by the days exertions he climbed
up to his improvised bedroom and flung
himself as he was upon the cot he fell
asleep almost immediately

 when crandall awoke and consulted his
watch he found it was past midnight he
rose and lit the lantern hung on a nail at
the head of the cot and started a leisurely
disrobing a sound as of stealthy footsteps
downstairs startled him momentarily and
then he smiled remembering that jim his
man friday slept on the floor below beside
the press he called down for reassurance
and in a moment got a ruffled reply so ex-

tinguishing the lantern he crawled back into
his cot

  sleep this time was not easy he tossed
about while a hazy procession of intoxicated
printers bewildering girls and truculent
sam basss paraded before him twice he
sat up and rearranged the coverings-the
last time he distinctly heard the walking
underneath again

  he sat up suddenly on the edge of the
cot of course it was only jim-but why
was he walking about so long maybe-

  whats the matter jim he called down
abruptly

  there vas no response and the noise be-
low was instantly stopped crandall feel-
ing a vague uneasiness arose from the cot
and lit the lantern again his automatic
the only weapon about the office was down-
stairs in the drawer of his desk despite
his growing fears he saw humorous possi-
bilities in the idea of burglars there was
nothing of value in the entire building but
his watch and a few coins he had depos-
ited almost his entire capital in the ocean
breeze national bank on the day of his ar-
rival he recalled jimmy lanes illustra-
tion of kid imagination and pulled
himself together half angrily still he
mused as he held the lantern so that the
faint rays would play on the opening into his
bedroom why hadnt jim answered his
call he stepped over to the edge of the
loft and as he did so he involuntarily uttered
a sharp exclamation a hand appeared at
the top of the ladder leading to the floor be-
low it was not jims hand-it was white
a head quickly followed and crandall
needed no second glance to identify the
owner-it was sam bass

  crandall set down the lantern

  well he inquired bracing himself foi
the expected attack

  bass leered up at him balancing himself
on the ladder the alcoholic odor from his
breath was almost overpowering

  you all had your turn this mornin im
fixin to have mine now he said standing
free of the ladder in the little box-like
space youre mighty smart with your
hands with a man that dont know nothin
bout them little tricks like you do well
lets see what kind of a man you all is
now


short stories

  with a quick movement he drew a heavy
bladed hunting knife from his pocket

  you see if you can knock me downbe-
fore i can get to you if you do you can do
what you like if you dont im sure goin
to cut you some

  you are certainly a fine citizen bass
said crandall sparring for time is this
your idea of fair play

  i aint fixin to argy with you bass re-
torted you know how to use your hands
and i know how to use this-thats all
crandall measured the distance between
the two with a quick eye

  do you think he began that if you
should cut me up some as you say that
youd escape a jail term

  i aint goin to think bass moved for-
ward dont talk no more get ready
they wont know who twas got cut when i
get workin with this yere knife

  crandall vaulted behind the bed and
stood in the cramped space hoping to evade
the others first rush and wrest the weapon
from his grasp but at this moment came
an unexpected interruption

  you all aint goin to do no cuttin mr
bass because if you git to foolin aroun
with that knife im jes naturally goin to
let this here gun go off an  got it set right
at you

  both men turned and faced the venerable
jim who stood at the top of the ladder with
crandalls automatic tightly clenched in
both hands his voice faltered and his
arms trembled but there was no mistaking
the desperate earnestness in his face

  recognizing him bass sneered impa-
tiently

  you best go away from here nigger
he said with a contemptuous glance at the
gun ill beat your head off when i get
through here

  yes sir boss-i knows you will jims
voice was pathetically gloomy but you
aint goin to cut mr crandall up none no
sir

  jim advanced another step up the ladder
as he spoke and as he did crandall think-
ing quickly yelled dont shoot jim
bass caught off his guard as crandall
had anticipated involuntarily turned his
head and when he turned back quickly
scenting the ruse the point of his jaw col-

lided with a terrific right swing sho
ward with all the force of crandalls mi
shoulders bass slithered back through
opening in the floor crashed into jim a
both fell clattering down to the floor below
carrying the ladder with them to the groun

  crandall stepped quickly to the openin
and vaulted down unhesitatingly he sa
in the uncertain light jim still clutching the
automatic lying stunned at the foot of the
ladder bass was rising to his feet sup-
porting himself along the wall it was to
him that crandall first gave his attention
he sprang over to him and grasped him
roughly by the shoulder swinging him
around easily despite his size

  bass he said youre pretty well used
up or i would give you the best beating of
your life if i ever see you around this of-
fice again ill give you a lacing youll never
forget now get out of here you near bad
man before i change my minu and wallop
you for luck

  bass stood uncertainly for a moment rub-
bing his chin he looked up glaring evilly
but what he saw in crandalls tense fea-
tures swiftly decided him and he turned
without a word and vaulted out the open
window through which he had entered the
office

  crandall stood watching him breathing
hard the realization of his close call coming
to him slowly he wondered what would
have happened had he been sleeping when
bass entered his bedroom he angrily
threw off the nervous shudder and stooped
over jim raising him carefully to a sitting
posture a cursory examination sufficed to
show that no bones were broken the old
negro was suffering mostly from the shock
of the fall and the reaction from his temerity
going to the water barrel outside crandall
returned with a glass of the liquid which he
sprinkled over jims face the latter
opened his eyes and made a weak effort to
get to his feet subsiding under crandalls
soothing efforts to restrain him

  you all didnt get cut none did you
boss he inquired anxiously

  no jim thanks to you its all right
now crandall answered

  whars that scoundrel beast sam
bass asked jim

  oh hes gone jim said crandall
the skyrocket



    ing to readjust the ladder that was
    ty close though wasnt it

    it was for sure agreed jim getting to
  s feet and rubbing his limbs ruefully
  im sure glad that sam didnt start to work
  ith his knife cause then id had to hit him
  ith this yere gun

  crandall took the pistol from jim and
examined it idly-then he uttered an ex-
clamation and opened the chamber it was
innocent of anything resembling a bullet

  did you know this thing wasnt loaded
crandall asked turning abruptly to jim

 yes sir boss-i knowed it-but sam
bass didnt answered jim showing his
teeth in a broad grin

 crandall reached out and took jims
gnarled ebony hand in his own

  i wont forget that jim he said if
sam bass had your nerve hed have killed
me

chapter vi
kid imagination loses

  the ocean breeze tribune as gotten out
by crandall and his staff might not have
been a thing of beauty but it was a joy for-
ever to the colonists-and crandall its six
pages contained the hopes joys sorrows-
and advertising of the community editor-
ially it was as open as the town itself
espousing no party or cause but devoting
itself solely to the advantages of ocean
breeze over the other towns and cities in
the universe on several occasions while
industriously writing of the singular free-
dom from mosquitos and other similar
pests that obtained in ocean breeze cran-
dall would stop in the making of a perfect
paragraph to kill a dozen or so o-f the little
insects off the very paper he was writing on
local news occupied the front page-start-
ling items such as the fact that ebenezer h
green a recent arrival from tulsa okla-
homa had acquired twenty pounds and a
new lease on life by a five weeks stay in
the colony or that plans for the new post
office were under way friday of each week
was the day the tribune was scheduled to
burst forth in print when crandall got the
paper out on saturday night of that week he
congratulated himself and his staff the
tribune was not inevitable but usual

  a few days after crandall had discour-

aged bass from further attacks on his per-
son miss stevenson paid an unannounced
visit to the tribune office at the time of
her call crandall was flat upon his broad
back in the pit under the press assisting
harkness the super-printer in an effort to
determine why the rollers refused to roll
getting down under a printing press differs
but slightly from reclining in the road under
an automobile the difference being that
the indoor pastime will permit one to ac-
cumulate more grime in a given tin than
the other when crandall arose and en-
tered the little office in the front of the
building he was admirably disguised from
head to foot with a generous coating of
printers ink he essayed flight when he
espied his visitor but the effort was futile
and the girl laughed frankly at the ludicrous
expression of embarrassment on his face

  gracious she exclaimed you must
have been having a dreadful time in your
editorial sanctum this morning the result
of that effort must surely be worth read-
ing

  i hope you will excuse my appearance

- began crandall awkwardly then-

if youll wait just a minute

  he fled precipitately to the water barrel
in the rear of the building grabbing a piece
of soap and a towel from its place on the
window sill as he ran he plunged his head
into the water and lathered himself vigor-
ously following this up with a hasty drying
with the towel-then he dashed back to the
office panting but shiningly clean the girl
was sitting at the typewriter tapping idly at
the keys she glanced up at his entrance
and smiled approval of his hasty toilet

  do you know she remarked suddenly
id give a great deal if i could be so
plunged into some work that id get just as
grimy and generally workmanlike looking
as you were just then

  crandall was struck with a wild thought

  well he said walking over to her id
give a great deal to have a staff in my office
here with those same ideas or ideals of
work i am shy at present one office or-
ganization now if you could only operate
a typewriter and wanted to-and thought
that one was all right and-

  the girl jumped to her feet clapping her
hands


short stories

  done she exclaimed when can i
commence 

  now crandall almost shouted take
this letter right away

  the girl entering gaily into the spirit of
the thing unhesitatingly seated herself at
the typewriter she seized a piece of paper
and inserted it in the machine then
turned her head poised inquiringly

  ahem crandall cleared his throat im-
portantly mr george x doe ocean
breeze florida got that

  he paced up and down the room passing
his hands over his hair as though in the
throes of dictating a message of most seri-
ous moment

  dear sir he went on  if you do not
pay your subscription to the tribune at

once-

  he halted and stroked his chin gravely
  yes yes go on cried the girl

  if you do not pay your subscription at
once crandall repeated sternly we will
send you the paper for another year he
finished laughingly

  oh now really the girl rebuked him
its not as bad as that ive seen a copy of
it and thought it splendid

  thanks rejoined crandall i hope
they think so in the new york office but
wait until you see the next issue its
going to be a hummer he added enthusi-
astically

  i can scarcely wait until it comes from
the press she assured him well any
more correspondence to-day

  yes answered crandall one more let-
ter take this mr george h hermance
new york n y got it dear sir i sent
you a letter last night in which i foolishly
intimated i was losing my infatuation for
ocean breeze kindly hurl said letter away
and put it down to the florida sun i will
stay on the job here as long as my office
force stays with me

  the girl flushed meeting his ardent gaze
she pulled the paper nervously around the
roller and then slowly pushed back her chair
and started to arise

  youre not casting off your job already
are you he began reproachfully and then
suddenly he shot out hoarsely dont
move

  the swift change in his tone the sharp

command startled the girl so that foi
instant she remained sitting stiffly in
chair she turned her head facing h
and what she saw in his white tense fac
stifled the exclamation on her lips h
stood staring as if held by a hypnotic spel
at her hair the terror in his eyes hi
drawn mouth was unmistakable littli
beads of moisture were formi g on his fore-
head with a half embarrassed gesture
the girls hands rose to her hair

  the act roused crandall from his stupor
he sprang forward and dashed her arm
roughly down unheeding her frightened
gasp the thing he was looking at was mov-
ing squirming horribly in an effort to right
itself it was a scorpion-of a species pe-
culiar to certain sections of the southland
the natives know it as a grampus it had
fallen from the damp timbers overhead and
lodged in the girls hair-and now it was
moving nearer her quivering flesh at the
lumber camp one day crandall had seen
one of the poisonous things crawl on the
bare leg of a negro turpentine mixer the
latter terror stricken had slapped at the
thing it gripped the victims flesh with its
pincher like claws and swung forward
swiftly its curling tail carrying the
venom the negro carried the mark of that
encounter to his last day

  crandall now stood over the girl who
seemed as stricken by his actions as he was
by her danger lanes phantasy kid
imagination squared off and threw down
the gauntlet as he waited he swore in-
wardly at the qualm that gripped him at the
memory of the negros fate it had not
been pleasant-he could not restrain the
shudder he knew that if he touched the
squirming hideous thing-

  dimly he realized tht instant action was
necessary as the scorpion was propelling
itself slowly but steadily over the girls hair
-soon it would reach her face the sight
of her crouching trembling form maddened
him and the quick coming emotion fought
off his fear he snatched up a ruler from
his desk and laid one end on the girls hair
directly in the path of the scorpion it con-
sumed possibly the fraction of a second in
reaching the wooden strip but crandall
died many lingering deaths as it came slowly
on its course once it reached the rule it
the skyrocket



  som have little more than two inches to
  reil to reach his hand

    le scorpion came to the edge of the rule
  rd invitingly forward touched it tenta-
  ely with a feeler hesitated then raised
  elf on the smooth wood the instant its
  athsome body left the girls hair crandall
  opped the rule to the floor and ground it
  under his heel

  the girl sprang up white and shaken
crandall faced her with a wan smile she
followed his glance to the floor and shud-
dered covering her face with her hands
crandalls laugh was strained as he dug his
nails into his hands in an effort to grip his
shaking nerves

  of course the thing might not have
harmed you he began with forced jocu-
larity but it didnf ook at all becoming in
your hair as a matter of fact i resented

lie intimacy-

  the giri interrupted turning on him sud-
denly with a swift intake of breath

  please dont est about it she mur-
mured if i had known-i would have died

of fright-i-

  she walked over to the window and stood
staring out crandall thought he had never
seen anything as beautiful as the picture
she made framed against the rough pins
boards her face flushing with the returning
color her hands pressed to her breast the
horror slowly fading out of her eyes he
seized a broom and with one sweep cleared
the floor of the thing the girl walked
slowly to the doorway

  i think ill go up to the villa she spoke
tremulously i dont feel quite up to-to
working any more just now she made a
brave attempt to smile

  of course crandall agreed hastily he
caught his hat from a peg over the desk
let me walk up with you

chapter vii

the house by the lake

  a week after the arrival of the girl in
ocean breeze the capacity of the villa
lorraine was strained by the addition of two
new boarders they were no less person-
ages than harold gordon stillman and ar-
thur butts-blythe official representatives of
the osceola land company at ocean

breeze they informed the covertly con-
temptuous havens girls in a patronizing
manner that the were drawn to the villa
by the tempting and savory odors from the
kitchen but it was quickly and audibly ob-
served by their fellow boarders that they de-
voted more attention to miss stevenson
than they did to the viands placed before
them on the table

  within three days after their advent they
rose to the heights of escorting her on short
explorations to the lake and elsewhere
crandall viewed this at first with tolerant
amusement but soon this gave wny to an
entirely different emotion for the girls
avoidance of him appeared studied while
she seemed to have fallen an easy victim to
the blandishments of the gorgeous youths
from the companys office the trio became
inseparable twice they were gone all day
on a hunting trip

  crandall felt his sudden isolation keenly
and the jocular consolation served to him
by his fellow boarders did much to increase
the feeling he was at a loss to understand
the girls apparent aversion to him-as sud-
den as it was patent she had never re-
turned to the tribune office since her first
visit indeed after that time he found it
difficult to engage her in conversation

  it was not long before they reached the
stage where a cool impersonal nod in pass-
ing was their only intercourse

  before crandall had flattered himself on
his progress there had been opportune
meetings not confined to the villa ex-
changes of each others ideals and ambi-
tions and he had found her a sympathetic
and understanding audience when he re-
lated his rise and fall in the prize ring he
had looked forward daily to this with an
unmeasured pleasure which grew until it
became a necessary part of his existence in
ocean breeze

  deprived of this now he gave himself
wholly to the perfecting of the tribune he
added many features from time to time-
among them the ancient but beloved con-
troversies between readers on the editorial
page the questions and answers and
occasionally he printed bits of alleged
poetry contributed by his subscribers in
many ways he helped himself into the good
graces of the colonists who did not hesitate


short stories

to tell him so and twice he received com-
mendatory letters from the new york office
he discharged harkness his bacchanalian
printer finding it futile to pit himself
against the latters appetite for whisky and
his readiness to indulge it in his place he
obtained a printer from jacksonville who
while not as versatile a craftsman as his
predecessor was more inclined to prohibi-
tion

  he discovered that the fervor with which
he threw himself into the work of making
the tribune a newspaper lifted the gloom
that had hung about him for the greater
part of the time since he had left new york
the deep-dyed indigo that comes with fail-
ure-that persists despite the most heroic
efforts to cast it off john barleycorn may
help keep it away for spasmodic intervals
but it returns and clings crandall fought
it with its natural enemy-work

  he improved his sleeping quarters at the
office by stringing a hammock on the porch
he soon became hardened to the mosquitos
and other pests that infest the soft southern
climes and found the open-air sleeping a big
improvement over the box-like compart-
ment he had previously constructed in the
office he had little or no time to ruminate
over his failure in the prize ring his wak-
ing hours were occupied with planning new
features for the paper or improvements for
the town itself he rose at five every morn-
ing jogged the two miles to the lake took
an invigorating plunge and returning to the
villa would eat an astounding breakfast
before flinging himself heartily into the
days work

  his letters back to lane in new york
changed rapidly from gloomy epistles to
cheery optimistic pages of his achieve-
ments in ocean breeze and his plans for
further conquests

  it was one intolerably hot night that
crandall after hours of tossing in the ham-
mock found sleep impossible and conceived
the idea of a cooling plunge in the lake al-
though it was past midnight he rose and
donned such garments as he thought he
could least dispense with took a towel from
his locker and started for the great pool of
stagnant water on the edge of the town as
he strode along he pondered over his future
and the tribunes his thought kept cen-

tering on the girl despite his efforts to  lall
them else vhere that afternoon in c an
pany with the ever present stillman l
butts-blythe she had passed the tribune i p
fice laughing merrily at what crandall wa
bitterly sure was some inane quip of 
of her escorts later he had learned froi
one of the havens girls that they had gon
to randalls island a strip of sand marooned
in the center of the lake on a berry picking
expedition she had given him a wave of
her hand as she passed the office and al-
though at that moment he was telling him-
self that she was quite ordinary after all he
rushed to the window and raised his cap the
color rising to his face and when he
turned back to his desk his hands were
trembling

  in order to reach the lake it was necessary
to pass the little wooden shack housing the
two representatives of the osceola land
company and crandall noted with some
surprise that a light was shining brightly
from one of the windows he glanced
around preparing to make a detour of the
place when the sound of loud and angry
voices was borne to him on the night air
it was a quite human curiosity that made
him strain his ears for some enlightening
sound

  drawing near the shack he heard still-
mans voice rising excitedly and caught the
girls name coupled with words that made
him move closer to the house and stand be-
hind a giant pine that partially screened him
from observation

 you broke your word-you have no
word came stillmans voice thick with
anger you swore youd stay here at the
office i thought you were a gentleman
but youre a low cad

  crandall waited the sound of the blow-
but there was none instead came the
suave sneering voice of butts-blythe

  it is most amusing to me when a rela-
tive of the biggest crook in our fair country
has the assurance to insult one who is his
physical mental and social superior

  you dirty liar stillmans voice rose to
a shrill shriek how dare you say my uncle
is a crook hes too good-

  be still the others tone was still un-
excited your breeding is getting the best
of you i repeat your uncle is a crook and
the skyrocket



  en these poor devils hes brought down
re find it god help us there are a great
lany you know who will make a fight of it
ahen they are thrown off their land when
they find that hermance the great philan-
thropist is simply a glorified confidence man
why you poor fool if the united states
government ever gets suspicious of this
arcadia here hell go to atlanta so quick it
will make your hair curl

  you ungrateful dog broke in stillman
hotly after all weve done for you too

i suppose youll turn blackmailer next-

  wait interrupted butts-blythe his
voice had suddenly changed crandall list-
ened eagerly marvelled at his powers of dis-
sembling let us stop this at once we two
are foolish to quarrel no more about your
respected uncle after all its no concern of
mine ill stick to the original bargain
your idea is obsolete almost antediluvian
but ill do it in the morning well ask the
fair lady to decide and if i lose ill pack up
and leave ill expect you to do the same
if i am the victor

  a confused mumbling followed and
though crandall strained every nerve to
hear he could make nothing coherent out
of the indistinct dialogue hearing foot-
steps coming toward the door of the shack
he retraced his steps to the open road and
started back quickly to the tribune office
his heart beat quickly his brain was a surg-
ing whirlpool of tumultuous thoughts one
thing stood clearly out of the maze that
was his first instinctive impression of her-
mance when he had stepped into his office
in new york seeking the editorship of the
tribune

  he was a crook

chapter viii

the island in the lake

  at six the next morning crandall
swollen-eyed and weary had mapped out a
plan of which the basic idea was to get to
the bottom of the fraud without arousing the
suspicion of hermance or his two under-
lings from whom he had gotten confirmation
of the smouldering flame of doubt a doubt
he had carried with him since his first meet-
ing with hermance in new york he wrote
a long letter to jimmy lane in which he

instructed his friend to lay the facts before
the managing editor of the press lanes
paper so that the denouement could be cov-
ered by his old aper in advance of its
rivals crandalls first and longest news-
paper job had been with the press it was
a large measure of loyalty that made him
anxious that it should score a beat on the
news and big news it would be cran-
dalls eyes sparkled at the very thought of
the sensation the exposure would create

  with glorious optimism of youth and
health he had no doubt that he would swiftly
get to the bottom of the mystery then he
would notify the federal authorities and
spring his sensation in the tribune while
the press was enlightening the world in
new york

  the ethics of the thing were not easily
dismissed he was an employee of her-
mance would it be fair play to burrow un-
der him and expose his benefactor it
troubled him for a long time to resign his
position and remain in ocean breeze would
cut off his income and possibly arouse
enough suspicion to hurt the success of his
undertaking then he thought of many of
the victims of hermances greed some
had spent their all in getting to ocean
breeze and buying a place to make their
homes widows veterans of the civil war
invalids and others few of whom were
financially able to investigate the altruism
of hermance for themselves in the ver-
nacular they simply followed the crowd

  at length he decided to proceed with his
investigation of the fraud if fraud there
was and lay its future course by its devel-
opments

  when he had finished his letter to lane
an idea that had been slowly growing on
him from the night before struck him with
such renewed force that he could no longer
resist it he knew lane to possess an un-
canny perception and his ability to get the
inside stuff on big stories had made him
stand out from the average reporter like a
diamond amongst glass it was a rare week
that the press failed to put over a beat
through the enterprise of jimmy lane the
city editor had once summed up his ability
when he turned to the makeup man and
said

  id give my right eye to have that fellow


short stories

lane on the local staff hes a wonder
why that bird could go out and discover
what kind of rubber david used in the sling
that killed goliath

  it is quite certain that lane would have
made a stab at it as he would say if he
had been given just such an assignment

  crandall reasoned that lane could get at
the bottom of the muddle if anyone could
likewise he knew hermance-and there
crandall found himself stumped again
lanes father and hermance were chums at
college would some idea of loyalty pre-
vent jimmy from helping too he elim-
inated that thought swiftly once jimmy
knew that hermance snug and secure in
his luxurious offices was sending poor
helpless invalids to a strange country
mulcting them of their little hoards accumu-
lated at the cost of many o lifes necessi-
ties-he knew what his friend jimmy lane
would do

  not wanting to rewrite his long letter he
added a postcript in which he demanded that
lane explain the circumstances to his man-
aging editor and get time off to come to
ocean breeze and help him solve the rid-
dle he knew that lanes love of adventure
would win half the battle

  crandall ransacked every cranny of the
printing office in a hunt for something that
might serve as a possible clue upon which
to base his preliminary investigation but
the hunt was fruitless and he gave it up
convinced that the only possible place he
would get a start toward striking the heart
of the fraud was at the companys office to
go there and attempt a cross examination of
either stillman or butts-blythe he decided
would be as foolish as it would probably be
futile to go there during their absence
and search the place would be taking a long
chance that if discovered might lead to his
arrest

  he went mechanically about the work of
gathering material for the next issue of the
tribune for the balance of the morning and
at noon he was no nearer a solution as to
where to start the hunt than he was the
night before

  it was somewhat later than the usual
lunch hour when crandall took his place at
the table at the villa lorraine observing as
he did so that neither miss stevenson nor

her inevitable escorts were present la
havens brushing crumbs from the clo
watched him curiously as she passed h
place and then coming around the table sh
stood beside him polishing a salt shaker in-
dustriously with a napkin

  our friends are surely giving folks here
something to talk about she remarked ir-
relevantly

  crandall raised his eyebrows interroga-
tively

  oh you know what i mean went on
laura with a short laugh miss stevenson
and her trained bodyguards she made no
effort to hide her contempt

  crandall assumed an elaborate air of un-
concern and reached for the butter dish
but he made no answer

  i dislike to criticise anyone went on
laura evidently nettled at his lack of in-
terest but if we girls did anything like
that theyd run us out of town-to save its
morals she sniffed disdainfully setting
down the salt shaker with a bang makes
a lot of difference though if your clothes are
home made or turned out in new york and
whether you take a twenty-eight or thirty-
four bust

  im afraid i dont catch your drift
laughed crandall amused at her vehemence

  well you must be extra stupid to-day
then retorted laura you may tell me
that but that tight line around your mouth
says something else i wasnt brought up
on a cow ranch for nothing i mightnt
know women but i know men you know
blame well youre just sitting there eating
your heart out thats why youre trying to
appear so unconcerned at what im telling
you while all the time youre putting that
spoonful of grits in your shirt pocket in-
stead of your mouth

  crandall caught fairly started a star
mering rejoinder

  oh hush laura interrupted her man-
ner softening i know you mightnt
think so but ive had em say they couldnt
live without me too she laughed jerkily
that was before my hands got so red and
i lost my shape bending over the kitchen
stove and the wash tubs but thats neither
here nor there that charmer of yours left
here at five oclock this morning with them
other two fools for randalls island they
the skyrocket



  e there all day yesterday too-berry
  king

  the nasty inflection on the last words
ought an angry flush to crandalls face in
pite of himself and facing laura he held
ip a warning hand she merely shrugged
her shoulders and went on brushing off the
table

  crandall finished his meal in silence and
returned at once to the tribune office

  laura would have been quite satisfied if
she had seen his face as he sat at his desk
thinking of the information she had im-
parted to him with his dinner he thought
miss stevenson unconventional but her
pronounced liking for the callow pompous
youths was beyond him at first he told
himself cynically it was the old story-
money this he discarded as unworthy of
his growing adoration of the girl he had
been unable to fathom her coolness toward
him since the pair had come to board at the
villa but now he determined he would take
a hand and sit in this game too his jaw
set hard as he assured himself he would
fling his six feet of brawn and muscle into
the lists against her two gallants and stand
or fall on his merits

  work for the balance of the afternoon
was impossible he had been up all the
night before and now nature began to col-
lect her due he could scarce keep his
eyes open though his brain was active
enough after some deliberation he decided
to obtain the loan of thad newells boat and
cruise about the lake it was insufferably
hot and the cooling breezes there would re-
fresh him he would be where interruption
would be almost impossible and he could
think and plan undisturbed accordingly he
repaired to the railroad station and secured
the desired permission from thad

  newells motor boat was exactly the kind
of craft one would expect thad to own
it was a converted dory which thad had la-
boriously made into a gasoline propelled
craft by the expedient of putting an engine
formerly the vitals of a motorcycle in it
thad had bought the motorcycle he had
once explained to crandall in a rash mo-
ment when it arrived at ocean breeze
he soon discovered that it would not give
the florida sand even a respectable battle
it simply laid down and refused to mote

thad ripped out the metal parts of it and
used all but a few bolts and screws in the
construction of his motorboat it was an
unhandsome thing when completed but
there was nothing on tl  lake that could
approach it for speed

  after cruising aimlessly about the lake
for an hour or more crandall succumbed to
the overpowering desire to visit randalls
island the last argument he used on him-
self with telling effect was that he had not
seen miss stevenson and her escorts leave
on their expedition they would not know he
knew they were there and it would not
seem deliberate therefore if he did meet
them

  fifteen minutes later he was wading to
the verdant shore of the island dragging
the painter of his boat this he fastened to
a tree stump recognizing the pretentious
craft he found moored at the same spot as
stillmans

  rolling down his trousers which he had
fastened about his knees to escape a wet-
ting as he waded to the shore he stood un-
certainly at the edge of the thick brush that
all but covered the island he had no wish
to come upon the party at once he sat
down on the improvised moorage and rolled
a cigarette the stillness about him was
almost unearthly it was singularly depress-
ing a lone hawk flew overhead its weird
shrill cry adding to crandalls moodiness
the little island isolated in the great lake
of still water seemed to be the edge of the
world of humans a strange feeling of
uneasiness an impending something fell
upon crandall the absolute quiet the
calm of the glass-like sheet of water irri-
tated him he repressed a strong desire to
kick it stir it up and make it seem as if
some other thing about the place was living
and moving besides himself he rose ner-
vously picked up a stone and threw it idly
into the lake the splash echoed and re-
echoed sullenly sending great widening rip-
ples toward him impatiently he flicked
away the half-smoked cigarette the place
was getting on his nerves as he turned
toward the brush a vomans scream-a ter-
rible piercing note of horror awoke the
stillness the familiar ring in the voice that
uttered it sending him crashing through the
brush in its direction

chapter ix

the passing of butts-blythe

  the denouement was not just what cran-
dalls fears had prepared him for he found
the girl backed up against a tree her face
so white that its pallor startled him she
seemed graven from marble rather than
flesh and blood stillman crouched a few
feet away from her his eyes distended his
breath coming in sobbing gasps he held a
shining something in his trembling hand
and there was a faint smell of powder in
the air there was no sign of the other-
butts-blythe

  at sight of crandall the girl took a quick
step toward him and then as swiftly re-
traced it the movement caused crandalls
mouth to harden and he turned away from
her abruptly to the cowering stillman

whats the trouble he asked sharply

  stillman after an ineffectual effort to
force words through his quavering throat
pointed suddenly to the brush beside cran-
dall glancing down the latter saw a pro-
truding foot he stooped over swiftly and
pulled forth the body of butts-blythe he
knelt beside it laying his hand over the
heart although at first sight he felt the ac-
tion to be needless butts-blythe was quite
dead

  when crandall stood up the girl had
partially recovered her composure although
she seemed fighting off the breakdown only
by a supreme effort stillman stared at the
body as if fascinated his face working con-
vulsively

  how did it happen crandall asked
evenly

  he-i shot him stillman jerked out
it was a terrible accident-miss steven-
son will bear me out he turned appeal-
ingly to the girl who nodded almost im-
perceptibly her eyes away from crandall

  stillman looked from one to the other
his terror was pitiable

  i had a new automatic he went on the
words now coming quickly enough i just
got it from new york we were shooting
at that tree-taking turns he pointed to
the body his voice rising hysterically he
went over to pin a card on the tree it-it
-went off

he stopped exhausted by his emotion

  lets see the gun said crandall
etly after a pause i heard no report

  it has a silencer on it explained sti
man handing over the ugly looking weapo

  crandall examined it fr a moment the
thrust it in his pocket

  is-is he dead gasped stillman tug-
ging at his sleeve

  yes answered crandall facing him
and this will be a pretty serious business
im afraid

  it was on the tip of his tongue to add
that he had heard the quarrel of the night
before but something kept back the words
he turned to the girl addressing her coldly
though his arms ached to embrace her as
she stood trembling braced against the
tree bravely fighting the faintness that was
creeping over her he fought down the
desire to soothe her and steeled his resolve

  is that the way it happened he called
to her

  she nodded her head slowly

  i-i suppose it was the reply was
barely audible but stillman heard it

  you dont suppose i deliberately killed
him do you he cried stepping to cran-
dalls side

  crandall turned on him swiftly and stared
full into the others wavering eyes still-
man stirred uncomfortably and then averted
his face

  lets get back to ocean breeze said
crandall breaking the silence he turned
to the girl again

  it will not be very pleasant for you riding
back with-this he said indicating the
body with a quick gesture suppose we go
back first and notify the proper authorities
to come for the body

  the girl seemed grateful at the sugges-
tion and crandall felt amply repaid by the
glance she shot him under her moist lashes
with crandall trailing the three made their
way back to the beach in silence

  the journey back to ocean breeze was
made in stillmans boat the other being
towed stillman sat in the stern steering
the craft he gazed out over the lake seem-
ingly unconscious of the presence of the
other two the girl sat in the bow in front
of crandall the only word spoken on the
trip across was when they made the string-
piece at ocean breeze as stillman
the skyrocket



  imbed out of the boat he turned to cran-
dall

  will you notify the proper people here
ill wire-to new york

  certainly answered crandall he did
not resent the sudden sympathetic note that
stillmans drawn face struck in him he
did not look the slayer at that moment he
was little more than a boy yet he had aged
years since crandall had seen him a day or
so before

  crandall voiced an idea that struck him
as the three walked along the pier toward
the town

  they will probably-hold you for a time
stillman he said abruptly and i will also
be detained i suppose unfortunately he
turned to the girl it has become known
that you three started out together this
morning and they will probably question
you-the authorities you know-but they
will not detain you i am sure he finished
with a confidence he was far from feeling

  at the end of the stringpiece crandall
saw thad newell coming toward them down
the road he approached the trio staring
curiously at their set faces but not seeming
to sense the tragedy

  heres a telegram for you all he called
to crandall waving the yellow envelope
crandall took it thanking him and tore it
open as he walked along the message
was brief it read

  tom crandall

       ocean breeze fla

get me tent coming to pay you visit

  be there saturday 

lane

  his letter to lane would reach him then
on the day he contemplated leaving new
york

chapter x
enter jimmy lane

  the coroners inquest into the death of
butts-blythe was held at kissimmee the
county seat and afterward the body was
shipped back to new york as crandall
had expected stillman and himself were
held for the grand jury crandall was
charged with being a material witness de-
spite his protestations and the testimony of

the girl that he had not seen the actual
shooting

  the girl was paroled in the custody of
her counsel while the charge against still-
man was murder miss steven ons account
of the shooting was similar io stillmans
except for one detail she swore that her
back was turned when stillman fired that
detail was enough for the jury of farmers
and planters who were immediately antag-
onized by the sight of stillmans silk hosiery
and patent leather shoes and his northern
accent confirmed all their suspicions

  when the time came to hear crandalls
motion to be admitted to bail pending ac-
tion by the grand jury he discovered two
things first that the soft spoken sleepy-
eyed lawyer he had engaged had more than
earned his retainer and second that his
efforts to build up the tribune and ocean
breeze had not gone for naught from the
president of the first national bank of
ocean breeze to the postmaster dozens of
the colonys influential citizens came over to
the court house and attested their readiness
to go his surety and on record as to his
character the old county judge adjusted
his glasses and surveying the imposing
array of witnesses before him cast off the
shackles of it-never-was-done-before and
fixed crandalls bail at ten thousand dol-
lars the county prosecutors opposition to
the move was perfunctorily brief

  lane arrived in ocean breeze the same
afternoon that crandall was released from
the county jail at kissimmee crandall
took him immediately to the tribune office
and went over his experiences in detail
from the time he had got his first inkling
that the great colonizing scheme at ocean
breeze might put hermance its sponsor in
jail up to the time of lanes arrival at
the first mention of fraud lanes face wore
an expression of indulgent attention but as
crandall proceeded to the quarrel he had
overheard at the companys office down by
the lake and the subsequent killing of
butts-blythe his friends tense interest was
unassumed

  well there you are crandall con-
cluded you have the scenario-what do
you think of it all

  lane was silent for a moment

  tommy he began at length it is hard


short stories

for me to believe that hermance my
fathers friend is a crook that hermance
the financier could be one i have no doubt
-you see what i mean he and my father
you know were chums i college and later
business associates my dad died when i
was quite young so that i have only a hazy
recollection of the latter part he left
nothing at his death as far as i have been
able to ascertain but his blessing but i
know that while my mother lived she would
not permit hermance to help us in any way
i remember i always thought that strange
but it might have been her womans in-
tuition now i am wondering if hermance
did not have something to do with our
poverty

  i wouldnt be surprised asserted cran-
dall after this

  well well soon see declared lane
slapping the desk with his hand do you
think stillman killed this butts-blythe de-
liberately 

  i dont know confessed crandall the
motive is there

  but why did this girl support his story
of an accident persisted lane

  she didnt support it corrected cran-
dall she said she didnt see it

  lane snorted incredulously

  id certainly like to see this goddess he

said impetuously i-

  crandall was quick to ward off what he
read in lanes mobile features

  all right jimmy he broke in dont
say it lets get down to cases on this
thing-where do we start

  ill start by sending a wire to my revered
managing editor was lanes answer ill
try and sketch some of this in a night letter
and do it so the entire world wont find it
out ill mail him a more complete synop-
sis later in the evening wait until i get
that off my chest and ill tell you a little
plan i have just worked out

  at this moment came an unexpected in-
terruption in the form of the old colored
man jim-crandalls man friday he en-
tered the office cap in hand casting a sus-
picious glance at lane stammering an
apology he was about to leave when cran-
dall called to him

  what is it jim dont be afraid here
jim this is mr lane my best friend lane

this is the jim i wrote you about la
slapped the old negro heartily on the back
his eyes sparkling

  ive heard all about you jim he said
and im glad to see you in the flesh
yes sir boss answered jim his
seamed face beaming with pleasure is
sure glad to see any of massa crandalls
friends-yes sir

  he stood teetering from one foot to an-
other his face wreathed in smiles

  did you want to see me for something
jim asked crandall

  oh surely boss jim ejaculated i
like to forgot it theres a young lady out-
side there and she wants to see you
crandall leaped instantly to his feet as
did lane the latter looking about hastily
for a place to retreat

  send her in at once jim commanded
crandall here stay here lane if my
guess is correct i want to see your face
when you look at the most beautiful girl

-ssh-

  miss stevenson hesitatingly entered the
office and glanced about her she came
forward eagerly when she saw crandall
and then stopped flushing slightly that her
action had been observed by another for
lane had been half screened by the open
door and now he too came forward in some
embarrassment though his eyes disclosed
the fact that crandalls description of their
visitor was conservative if anything cran-
dall broke the strained pause

  i hope you will forgive me miss steven-
son for keeping you waiting he said
apologetically but jim took so long to

announce you-

  his smile was irresistible as he motioned
lane forward

  this is mr lane of new york we were
together for a time on the staff of the press
-miss stevenson jimmy

  lane returned the girls bow and then be-
fore either of the others could speak he
strode to the open door

  just at the moment you came he said
easily addressing the girl i was about to
send a most important telegram-in fact i
had reached the other door thinking it the
one to the street-or road i should say
he smiled at both of them ill just run
along now before the operator goes home
the skyrocket



  youll pardon me im mighty pleased to
  ve met you miss stevenson

  he bowed again and was gone

  the girl appeared to frown slightly at
lanes hasty departure and she flashed a
keen half-inquiring glance at crandall who
met it unwaveringly he pulled forth his
ramshackle desk chair

  she declined the proffered seat with a
gesture and walked over to the desk

  i do not want to hold up the progress
of the tribune for any longer than i can
help she began crandall thought her
jocularity sounded strained i want you to
know that i am glad that you came out of
that-that-muddle all right that is she
corrected herself confusedly i am glad
they did not keep you in jail

  she stopped and crandall entranced by
her nearness said nothing until she cleared
her throat embarrassedly then without
taking his eyes from her face said awk-
wardly

  dont mention it-i-i-mean thanks
they both laughed then and the girl
moved toward the door

  there is one other thing she said her
hand on the knob i want to apologize for
my rudeness since-since the last time i
was here there is a reason for it she
continued earnestly which i cannot ex-
plain now i dont want to sound mysteri-
ous but i just cant say any more at the
present moment she blushed deliciously
it has been very trying i assure you i
dont know what you will think of me for
coming here to tell you this or for having
it to tell but i want you to know that i val-
ue your friendship and she opened the
door i think youve made the tribune just
splendid

  crandall stepped forward eagerly but
she was gone

  he flung himself bewildered down in his
chair there was then a reason for her
coolness when lane discreetly knocked
on the door a few minutes later and getting
no response entered the office he found
crandall seated at his desk muttering i
value your friendship highly over and over
with a different inflection of his voice at
each repetition

  whats that he asked amazedly

  eh oh hello jimmy how are you i

mean did you send your wire all right
crandall jumped up startled

  say whats the matter with you
asked lane suspiciously have you
slipped off the wagon or-oh he stopped
suddenly and smiled broadly i got it now
he shook a warning finger none of that
until we get to the bottom of this tangle i
will say though tommy that she is consid-
erable girl but say i sent the wire and
made it good and strong now its up to us
to make good on what i wired barnes

  it will be some story if we put it over
wont it breathed crandall staring pen-
sively at the ceiling

  you said it was lanes laconic com-
ment some story is right

chapter xi

the riddle

  upon returning to the tribune office next
morning after breakfast at the villa cran-
dall and lane again went into consultation
in which many ways and means of getting
to the bottom of hermances scheme were
discovered discussed and discarded in or-
der finally lane said earnestly

  there is only one way to get started on
this thing tommy and that is to comb the
office where this stillman held forth from
top to bottom as long as he is away it
should be comparatively easy particularly
as you are the only accredited representa-
tive of the company here now somewhere
in that office among the ledgers and other
what not records of sales for instance
there must be a tangible something that vill
give us a hint

  well crandall admitted i guess you
are right ive looked at this thing from
every possible angle i dont know where
the crookedness is but i do know it exists-
partly from my impression of hermance
when i saw him in new york and partly
from what i heard that night at the lake
on the other hand the people who have
bought lots here from the company all seem
satisfied except in a few isolated cases of
chronic grumblers they have not been
charged exorbitant rates for their few acres
of sand-on the contrary it appears to be
absurdly cheap now whats the answer
thats what were here to find out re-
f

short stories

turned lane weve got to know he add-
ed grimacing why if this should turn
out to be a bloomer id lose my job

  yes laughed crandall and if it dont
ill lose mine

  well dont lets have any post mortems
now rejoined lane ill stay here and you
go down to the companys office and turn
things upside down dont hurry take
your time if you dont find what were
after to-day weve got to-morrow you
know

  crandall rose and after instructing lane
as to what disposition to make of possible
callers during his absence he set off at a
brisk pace for the little shack by the lake
passing the railroad station he waved a
greeting to thad newell who was sitting
in the same position in which crandall had
first found him feet propped up on the lit-
tle counter of the telegraph office window
he puffed prodigious clouds of evil-smelling
smoke from a venerable pipe his broad
brimmed straw hat tipped forward success-
fully covering his face and his hands
crossed over his sparse middle a picture of
lazy content raised to the nth power

  a group of idlers young and old held
forth as usual beside the water tank cran-
dall had tried futilely several times to in-
duce some of them to go to work for in the
fast-growing town there were many vacan-
cies for both skilled and unskilled labor it
got on his nerves to see them for the most
part strong and healthy dawdling about the
railroad station from early morning until
late at night doing nothing in a place where
organized and earnest effort were needed
to make the coming city a reality their
evil thoughts showing in their coarse quips
and covetous glances were an insult to pass-
ing women by day while at night they made
sleep impossible with their discordant
quartet singing of sentimental ballads

  an odd job now and then earned a meal
another a sleeping place one or two had
buzzard-like swooped down on a colonists
cast off tent

  to crandall they were a swarm of flies
in the ointment of his glowing hopes for
ocean breeze every unfinished dwelling
was an eyesore to him every last brick or
log laid on a new one gave him a personal
feeling of satisfaction he was rapidly be-

coming a figure of importance in the coi
munity his opinion was sought on man
matters pertaining to its development by
the more progressive merchants who had
constituted themselves a temporary board
of trade pending the great event-the in-
corporation of the town crandall thought
grimly as he glanced contemptuously at the
gang in passing that when that event took
place they would become either workers or
exiles

  sam bass was a prominent figure in the
crowd although his estate had fallen some-
what since crandalls easy victory over him
in their first encounter since the night he
had invaded the tribune office he gave no
further evidence of open hostility and cran-
dall had long since dismissed him from
serious consideration

  as crandall neared the office of the com-
pany he marked that on the little wooden
step in front a long cadaverous individual
was sitting munching away on a huge
mouthful of tobacco while in one hand he
jangled a bunch of keys with a curious air
of proprietorship a sawed off shotgun was
standing against the side of the house with-
in arms reach

  crandall standing before the man rec-
ognized him as one of the sheriffs deputies
that had been pointed out to him on several
occasions in the town he was something
of a local character and was known as
gator joe from his marvellous feats as a
hunter of the alligator

  hello crandall greeted him pleasantly
im the editor of the tribune remember
me i want to go inside for a few minutes
and look over some of the companys books
im the official representative here now i
guess

  gator joe stared at crandall as though
he were some new species of alligator he
looked at him and through him then he
shifted the tobacco in his mouth missed a
crawling beetle by a hairs breath and im-
passively contemplated the heavens

  cant get in yere he announced dis-
passionately

  crandall already annoyed at the inspec-
tion controlled his rising anger with diffi-
culty

  im afraid you dont recognize me he
said quietly i have to get some very im-
the skyrocket



  rtant papers in that office-you can come
  with me if you like

   gator joe the adamant never shifted his
josition or gaze

  i dont forgit you like you say he
drawled but you all cant get in yere
why not demanded crandall

  there aint no reason why  got to tell
you began the other in the same calm un-
ruffled voice but i will sheriff elkins
tole me to come over yere and set by this
little ole shack until sundown come sun-
down jed lawsons coinin over yere to sit
in my place durin and while all this
yeres goin on they aint nobody allowed to
git in yere i aint no good at riddle and i
dont know why tis the sheriffs so power-
fut set on keepin you all out all i know
ive done tole you ceptin they aint no-
body goin to git in yere you all can rely
on that

  having delivered himself of one of the
longest speeches he ever made in his life
gator joe shifted his seat and pulling out
a huge jack knife started whittling lazily
at a branch he picked from the ground be-
side him

  this new turn of affairs mystified cran-
dall and he stood silently considering it he
finally arrived at the conclusion that her-
mance had ordered the guard at the office
now that stillman was away this went
to convince him beyond all doubt that there
was a fraud why he reasoned if every-
thing was all right should hermance bar
him from the office why instead had he
not written him to look after things in the
absence of his representatives

  knowing that argument with gator joe
would be useless he hurriedly retraced his
steps to the tribune office to acquaint lane
with the new development as he walked
up the steps of the office jim the old negro
came running around the side of the build-
ing

  mister lane done gone to kissimmee
he called to crandall about five minutes
after you went away he comes runnin out of
the office dr pope was passin in his auto-
mobile and mister lane yells out to him
then he runs over and they talks for a min-
ute and the fust thing you know mister
lane gets in this yere automobile of dr
popes and they goes off together  never

did see nothin go away from here so fast
before no sir

  but didnt he leave any word for me
asked crandall impatiently

  no sir boss answered the old negro
he never said nothin to me at all
crandall stepped inside the office and
walked quickly to his desk in a conspicu-
ous place he found a scrap of paper on
which was scribbled

    doing a little investigating on my own
  hook going over to work on this still-
  man and see if i can make him come
  through i figure that by the time you
  get back from the office i will be all
  cleaned up over here

  it was signed with lanes initials
crandall sat down wearily somewhat ir-
ritated that lane should rush off in this
fashion without any previous intimation that
he had any plan in mind he glanced at his
watch it was just a half hour since he had
left lane in the tribune office kissim-
mee was about twenty minutes away by au-
tomobile undoubtedly it would be a great
deal less at the speed jim said dr popes
car was traveling he devoted ten minutes
to checking up the advertising bills then
threw them down in disgust finding it im-
possible to add a column of three figures in
his present state of mind he sat back
drumming on the desk with a pencil-the
two and two he was trying to put together
had nothing to do with the tribunes adver-
tising bills

  a small urchin stuck his head in the door
timidly holding out a yellow envelope in a
grimy hand

  got something for me son inquired
crandall

  the boy nodded vigorously and came in-
side crandall gave him a coin and took
the envelope his pulses quickening as he
saw it was a telegram from hermance he
thought ripping it open

  he read the few words almost at a glance
-then he spread it out on the desk and read
it again carefully and aloud

    tom crandall
    tribune office
    ocean breeze
    come at once its all over

a wild ride

  crandall studied his watch reflectively
lane must have sent him the wire almost
as soon as he had arrived in kissimmee
also he reasoned jims description of the
speed at which the auto was traveling had
not been exaggerated he pushed open the
door into the pressroom and called to the
old negro who was helping williams his
new printer oil the press

  jim he said where can i get an auto
to take me to kissimmee

  jim removed his hat and passed his hand
over his head reflectively

  well boss he answered doubtfully
the onliest one i knows bout now would
be mister barbours theres only bout
two of them things round yere and i
guess-

  but crandall had seized his hat and was
gone

  barbour was the proprietor of the drug
store a leader in the board of trade move-
ment and a great admirer of the tribune
crandall knew that if he could but find him
at the store the car would be placed at his
disposal without question there were but
two trains in or out of ocean breeze daily
one at seven in the morning and the other
about the same hour at night so that cran-
dalls only chance of obeying lanes injunc-
tion rested with barbour

  he hurried to the drug store and found
barbour in his weird smelling laboratory
compiling a prescription for the venerable
mr simms who sat waiting in the store
devouring a huge plate of ice cream with
audible enjoyment crandall returned his
cheery greeting as he passed through to the
rear of the store

  he briefly outlined the situation to bar-
bour without telling him the reason of his
eagerness to reach kissimmee within the
hour the druggist weighed out the powder
he was mixing with slow and aggravating
nicety he clucked his tongue several
times nodded to crandall perfunctorily and
checked off an item on the prescription be-
fore him then turned and drawled humor-
ously 

  if i get to puttin too much of that there
strychnine in there it might be fatal to that

old comrade whats that you all wt
tellin me

  crandall on edge as the precious tin
flitted by repeated his request for barbour
auto he had wasted fifteen minutes al-
ready he thought fuming inwardly when
every moment was valuable lanes note
left much to speculation but come at
once from jimmy lane meant action-
of that crandall was sure

  i sure would like to let you take that old
car said barbour when lane had finished
theres only one thing thats going to stop
me from doing it too

  whats that asked the dismayed cran-
dall

  a dry chuckle ecaped barbour

  the ole fool things busted he an-
swered i hitched the motor up to my ice
cream freezer this morning-that ole fool
cal turner told me id save a lot of time
by so doing i saved a lot of time right
enough but boy i wasted enough grade a
cream to set me back for a week i threw
that there old engine over on the high
speed and  never have seen so much loose
ice cream since or before that there old
milk and eggs and cream shot around here
something scandalous i just naturally
ruined my clothes before i got it where it
would stop that litle ole engine is in such
a condition now that it never will run no au-
tomobile anymore

  the doleful grimace with which barbour
uttered the last would have amused cran-
dall had the situation been less serious but
thought of the waiting lane quickly dis-
pelled any humor he might have seen in his
present plight

  have you any idea how i can get to
kissimmee before that last train to-night
he asked barbour anxiously

  the other reflected a moment as he mixed
the prescription in the mortar

  cant you get a horse he demanded
suddenly

  this was one means of locomotion that
had entirely escaped crandall perhaps
because he had never bestrode one in his
life but that fact did not deter him now
from grasping eagerly at the opportunity to
do so

  i never thought of that he exclaimed
where can i get one do you know
the skyrocket



ill let you take old jess responded the
ther jess will take you to kissimmee or
ampa or any place you want to go and
shell fetch you there so quick youll think
she just stood here and they brought the
place over

  he appraised crandalls huge form with
a swift glance

  you all can ride i reckon he asked
eh oh sure crandall responded
readily having no doubt that riding a horse
was like riding a motorcycle or learning the
intricacies of bridge the mere fact that
one had never accomplished it was no rea-
son why it should be a difficult feat so
many others did it so well

  all right said barbour wait until i
get comrade simms fixed up and ill bring
jess around

  crandall knew that to attempt to hurry
barbour was a feat on a par with trying to
stop the water over niagara falls so he was
obliged to curb his impatience and await the
latters pleasure he walked out of the lit-
tle back room and pushed through the door
into the front of the store as the door
swung outward it hit mr simms with such
vigor that the old veteran would have top-
pled over had it not been for crandalls
steadying arm even as he apologized pro-
fusely it struck crandall as odd that the
other should be in that stooping posture at
the door as he opened it and simms evi-
dently sensing as much from crandalls ex-
pression shook his fist angrily in the gen-
eral direction of the prescription room

  ive been waiting here for half an hour
for that infernal poison that fellow is mix-
ing me he said to crandall whats he
doing in there fixin to kill me
crandall smiled at the old mans testi-
ness and temporarily forgot his suspicions
he sat down by the soda fountain drum-
ming nervously on the counter with his
fingers finally after what seemed ages to
him barbour came out with the prescrip-
tion and simms grumblingly paid for it and
departed barbour beckoned to crandall
and led him to a sort of barn in the rear of
tlie store which served as a garage for the
automobile and a stable for the redoubtable
jess the horse a spirited animal was led
out and saddled and crandall experienced
some slight qualms as jess reared skittishly

during the process taking a last precau-
tionary hitch on the saddle girth barbour
stood with his hand on the bridle while
jess snorted and pawed the ground

  all you got to do he called to cran-
dall is to point this little ole rabbit for
kissimmee once you get to the plank road
then just hang on tight because shell sure
make you pull leather before you get
there

  crandall had not the faintest idea what
pulling leather meant but he gave what
he flattered himself was a knowing nod al-
though his misgivings increased by the spec-
tacle of the prancing jess fighting to get
away from barbours restraining hand
however it was too late to withdraw now
he decided so he approached the animal
warily until catching barbours curious
glance he halted uncertainly

  you surely aint fixin to mount from
that side are you

  barbours voice rose incredulously

  well- crandall began

  barbour chuckled loudly

  jess would bounce you so high you
never would come down he assured cran-
dall go around the other side and git up
-i wont be able to hold her much longer

  crandall with many an inward pang
stepped boldly enough to the side indicated
by barbour and thrust a foot into the dang-
ling stirrup jess at once attempted to bal-
ance on her hind legs and crandall experi-
enced a sinking feeling in the region of his
stomach although the unexpected lurch
nearly threw him to the ground he man-
aged by some good fortune to retain his
balance and his groping foot found the
other stirrup he sat up stiffly and barbour
stood away from the animals head eyeing
him strangely crandall leaned over the
sweating mane with elaborate unconcern

  which is the shortest way to kissim-
mee he asked

  if barbour answered his question cran-
dall did not hear him the next five min-
utes though were branded indelibly on his
memory the thrill he had often experi-
enced in the prize ring when the hoarse
deafening roars of the blood-crazed mob
sang around him as he set his muscles for
the knockout were as nothing to those
packed in that short space of time only


short stories

one who has sat a runaway horse could
share experiences with crandall

  as he had bent over the animals neck
toward barbour a fluttering leaf tossed by
a sudden breeze had lit for a moment upon
his hand as he flicked it off impatiently
it struck fairly the distended eye of the ner-
vous jess

  a wild leap a warning yell from barbour
as he went sprawling and then began the
terrible fearsome dash through the narrow
road that lay out of the town to the broad
highway to kissimmee startled pedestri-
ans fled for safety and watched from van-
tage points the mad flight crandall white-
faced fear gripping his heart hung to the
saddle horn like grim death and stared
straight ahead the cutting wind mingled
with the cries of those who escaped the fly-
ing hoofs by a hairs breadth sang past him
in a confused roar a fallen tree loomed
up before him-he closed his eyes and held
his breath-a deep gully made by the
heavy rains showed suddenly ahead in the
sand-a faltering slump as they sank in the
depression a crazy stumble-and the heart-
breaking pace went on unchecked

  a dozen times during the next five min-
utes crandall and death came face to face
but each time he beat the turn of the wheel
it was a good four miles to kissimmee over
the plank road of its general direction
crandall had only a vague idea but the
horse even in its crazed flight kept true to
the course it knew and for two miles the
speed was unslackened the ears were
stretched back until they were level with the
sweating mane and the flying foam from the
distended lips was born back and flecked
crandalls face as he leaned forward in the
saddle he fought hard for the mastery
but even with his immense strength his ef-
forts were puny ani futile his touch held
no familiarity to the flying jess he could
not make her deviate a notch from her
chosen path

  half way to kissimmee the railroad
tracks crossed the road and as crandall
spied the crossing coming swiftly around
the bend in the road he gave earnest thanks
that there were but two trains along it daily
-both hours away his one fear now was
that the horse would stumble over the
raised rails and with this thought in mind

he threw all his straining muscle intt
tug on the bridle he was rewarded by
almost imperceptible slackening of spe
and he redoubled his efforts finally bring
ing the wary animal to a trot within a few
feet of the crossing

  utterly exhausted he leaned back in the
saddle for the first time since the dash be-
gan his entire body was covered with a
clammy perspiration his eyes were sore and
bloodshot he loosened his collar from
around his cracking throat and gingerly
rubbed his smarting skin reaching a care-
ful hand for his watch he looked at the dial
and then held it incredulously to his ear
it was just a few seconds under five minutes
since he left barbours store

  the balance of the trip to kissimmee was
consumed at a jog trot after half a mile
crandall almost wished the mare would re-
sume its former speed with every move-
ment of the animal he was tossed back and
forth in the hard saddle until he was forced
to stand upright in the stirrups at length
the outbuildings of kissimmee hove into
view and within a few minutes crandall slid
stiffly from the saddle in front of the post
office when he stood upright he ached in
every bone and muscle and there were blis-
ters forming in the palms of his hands from
his grips on the bridle he tied the halter
to a hitching post and limped over to the
court house lane was coming down the
steps as he approached and ran forward to
meet him

  well what do you know crandall
called eagerly before his friend could
speak

  lane made a gesture of disappointment

  the thing fell through tommy he
said he wont say a word on the other
hand he swears he knows nothing of any
scheme on the part of hermance or any one
else i worked on him until a moment ago
-tried everything under the sun but it
was of no use that stillman boy is the
original stand-patter all i succeeded in
doing was to tip him off that we were on to
his uncle so i suppose hell burn the wires
to new york now

  he surveyed crandall curiously

  say he exclaimed you look as if
youd been through the mill-what-

  i have interrupted crandall feel-
the skyrocket



       but why did you wire me to come
   at once

  heh lane looked at him puzzledly
  didnt send for you youre crazy 
  t you a note in the office

  i know crandall broke in impatiently
but how about this

  he pulled the telegram from his pocket
and thrust it in lanes eager hand his
friend tore the message from the envelope
and read it aloud amazement spreading
over his face

  this is great stuff he ejaculated this
cinches it you have the right idea tommy
theres some big doings due to happen to
our friend hermance you can gamble your
life on that of course i never sent this
but im going to find out who did right
now come on

chapter xiii

       the vanishing telegram

  the bewildered crandall followed lane
to the railroad station where they made at
once for the telegraph office the operator
was engaged in filing some official des-
patches and the two were forced to wait
some few minutes before the guardian of
the key gave them his attention lane took
the initiative spreading the telegram out
on the counter

  this wire was sent from here to this
gentleman mr crandall editor of the
ocean breeze tribune he began by
some one who passed themselves off as me
have you by any chance the original mes-
sage

  the operator picked up the telegram eye-
ing both lane and the scrap of yellow paper
with impartial suspicion

  well he said after a pause its abso-
lutely against my orders to do any such
thing but i dig around here some and see
if i can find that there message i remem-
ber the fellow that sent it all right because
there aint many wires sent from this little
old place for one thing and for another i
never did see that same fellow around here
before he sure dont belong here that i
know

  what did he look like asked cran-
dall eagerly

  the operator reflected

  he was about your size he said after
a moment turning to lane he had a blue
suit on and wore a cap and-but he ought
to be pretty easy to find bein a stranger
around here and all that you fellows go
over and see sheriff elkins hell get him
for you in no time

  well do that lane assured him but
how about the original message

  the operator reached for a spindle file
at the far end of the counter and pawed
slowly over the papers fastened on it he
gave a sudden snort of satisfaction and
slipped a piece of paper off the file

  here she is he said

  in the act of passing it over to lane he
stopped and stared at it with a puzzled ex-
pression then he pawed rapidly over the
remaining papers on the file his jaw drop-
ping in amazement crandall unable to
restrain his curiosity reached over with a
quick movement and snatched the paper
from his hand it was a regulation tele-
graph blank with the accent on the last
word for beyond a couple of lead pencil
markings the piece of paper was absolutely
blank

  what do you call this cried lane
peering over crandalls shoulder at the
paper

  the operator was frenziedly sorting out
the other papers on the file

  look at that he almost shouted he
tore the blank from crandalls hand and
waved it excitedly theres my check on
it see thirty cents paid rush see
thats my writing thats the blank that
fellow wrote his message on

  but theres nothing on it cried cran-
dall

  youve made a mistake look at the
others suggested lane

  thats the one i tell you declared the
operator positively all these others are
accounted for

  lets see it again commanded lane
he picked up the blank and held it up to
the light the strong sunlight reflected
through the yellow paper disclosed a faint
blurring here and there on the printed lines

  i have it now exclaimed lane sud-
denly believe me tommy we are fight-
ing a classy bunch there are no crude
workers on hermances staff


short stories

  whats the answer demanded cran-
dall

  dont you get it answered lane hold-
ing up the paper its easy the fellow
that wrote this used that so-called sympa-
thetic ink the stuff is so volatile it simply
vanishes a short time after you put it on
paper

  the operator stared dumbfoundedly at
lane crandall whistled softly between his
teeth

  isnt there anything that will bring that
writing out he asked suddenly

  im going to try one experiment now
was lanes answer as he drew a match from
his pocket lets see how heat will af-
fect it

  he lit the match and held it at a safe dis-
tance from the paper yet near enough for
the heat to penetrate the three watched
eagerly but even though the flame scorched
the paper there was no sign of legible writ-
ing on its surface

  well lane threw away the match dis-
gustedly that wont do it maybe an acid
will he turned to the operator as long
as this thing is no good to you this way will
you let me take it and see if i can bring the
writing back

  the operator scratched his head medi-
tatively eyeing the paper as if fascinated
by it

  go ahead he said finally with evident
reluctance but ill look for you to bring it
back here to-morrow ill let you try your
hand on it until then

  lane thrust the telegram in his pocket
and he and crandall left the station

  they had hardly passed through the door
when the operator seemed to come sud-
denly out of his trance he straightened
up swiftly stuck two fingers in the corner of
his mouth and emitted an ear-piercing
whistle it startled both lane and crandall
and an old lady who was selecting folders
from the rack so that they all jumped sim-
ultaneously the operator waved a beckon-
ing hand to crandall who ran forward ex-
pectantly

  i like to forgot something very impor-
tant was the operators greeting youre
the editor of that there newspaper in ocean
breeze aint you

  yes answered crandall what is it

  the operator grinned sheepishly

  ivy lawson and pearl cook are
to give a little fudge party down to th
house this evenin he said confidenti
will you put a little somethin in yc
paper about it seein as how i let you tak
that telegram and everything

  crandall took a firm grip on his temper
which had been sorely tried during the past
hour

  oh sure he said the disappointment
showing in his tone is that all you wanted
to tell me

  that all answered the operator
frowning indignantly thats enough aint
it this heres goin to be some affair let
me tell you and if you dont want to put it
in your paper i guess i can get it in the
kissimmee gazette

  oh ill print it all right crandall as-
sured him not wishing to antagonize what
might prove a valuable ally be sure to
send me all the details he added

  ill do that little thing answered the
operator mollified

  crandall rejoined lane who was waiting
with ill-concealed impatience he laughed
heartily when crandall explained why the
operator had called him back for want of
a better place the two sat down on a bench
on the station platform lane glanced at
his watch

  i guess the best thing we can do now
he said is to wait for the train to ocean
breeze now the question before the meet-
ing is why should any one be so anxious
to get you away from the tribune office this
afternoon that they would send you a fake
wire

  give it up was crandalls rejoinder
i forgot to tell you he added that there
is a guard around the companys office and
i was refused admittance there this morn-
ing-which reminds me i want to go over
to the sheriffs office and get that very point
cleared up he jumped up how about
telling the sheriff about that telegram while
were there

  well well go over and see what he
looks like anyhow said lane rising
whats this about the guard at the com-
panys office

  as they walked over to the court house
crandall recounted his verbal clash with
the skyrocket



    jr joe lane listened with interest and
    n crandall had finished he said

  this fellow stillman has probably tipped
m off in new york that you or some one
wise to the game whatever it is and they
are taking no chances while he is away
from the office i suppose theyll send a
man down here soon to take charge you
havent heard a word from hermance i
suppose

  nothing answered crandall unless
there is a letter over there now

  they found the sheriffs office apparently
deserted repeated poundings on the door
brought no response and crandall called out
to a man who was passing on the opposite
side of the road

  sheriff around anywhere

  the man crossed over to them

  he went over to ocean breeze with
some deputies a little while ago he said
theyre having some big doins over there
about now  reckon he smiled grimly
id have gone myself but my old woman is
sick and i got to stay around yere most
everybody else is there though

  crandall had marked that the town
seemed strangely deserted but in the stress
of the moments following his arrival he had
not associated anything unusual with it

  whats the trouble over there do you
know he inquired anxiously

  i aint just got the right of it yet an-
swered the man but i hear a nigger has
gone to cuttin up over there and then hid
out in the woods-theyll get him though
he finished

  thats funny crandall turned to lane
i came over from there a little while ago
and everything was all right then thats
all you know about it eh

  thats all rejoined the other

  the sound of pounding hoofs came down
the road and soon a man riding hard came
into view

  here comes herb fletcher exclaimed
the native hell know what its all about
the sheriff sent for him and i guess hes
on his way there now

  the newcomer answered his hail by pull-
ing up suddenly as he breasted the trio and
the other called out

  whats the fuss over to ocean breeze
herb

  oh got a bad nigger thats all re-
sponded the other leaning down to tighten
his saddle girth that ole fool nigger
thats always hangin around the printin
office over there has gone and cut somebody
and got away clean well get him though
hope  dont miss it he added regretfully
i had to get me a new saddle-reckon it
will be all over when i get there

  he spurred the pony and was off
crandall who had been listening dazedly
yelled after him but the rider was lost in a
swirl of dust and sand he turned on lane
swiftly

  thats old jim they mean lane he
cried theyll kill him if we dont get over
there hurry up weve got to do some-
thing dont stand there looking at me
theyre crazy jim wouldnt hurt a fly
come on

  he tugged frantically at the astonished
lane

what can we do began lane mildly
the sheriff will only arrest him wont he
before crandall could answer the other
man who had been watching him curiously
broke in with a dry chuckle

  we dont make no habit of arrestin bad
niggers down yere he said cant put
em in jail with a white man and there aint
no other place for em dont worry the
boys will look after him

  you hear cried crandall to lane
theyll lynch that poor old fellow before
he has a chance to prove anything he
wasnt afraid to risk his old black body to
help me and im not going to let him go
now without making a try at it anyhow
his eyes were blazing with the old fight-
ing fury and despite what lane regarded
as his foolhardiness he felt a thrill of ad-
miration as he looked at him the other
man was also staring at crandall in aston-
ishment and it was he who broke the pause

  boss he said addressing crandall
you best not bother about that nigger be-
cause it sure wont do him no good and
youll only do yourself harm theres a
right smart bunch of the boys after that
nigger and when they get him they aint

goin to listen to nobody-

  yes i know interrupted crandall
hotly about a hundred of them armed
against one poor old frightened nigger


short stories

he turned to lane i came over here on
a horse im going back on it now you
wait for the train and ill meet you at the
tribune office

  he ran for the post office where he had
left barbours mare

  come here lane shouted after him
he sprinted along at crandalls side tug-
ging at his coat in an effort to stop him

  have you gone insane he shouted in
crandalls ear as the latter shook him off
youll never have a chance with that
bunch let this thing go you cant help
it maybe the nigger did cut some one
how do you know if anything happens to
you well never get to the bottom of this
tangle he jerked out breathlessly

  dont miss that train crandall an-
swered him slowing down to a brisk walk
as they neared the post office ill be there
waiting for you and we dont want to lose
any more time than we can help

  but listen cried lane frantically
you-

  crandall gingerly approached jess boost-
ed himself up somehow and grasped the
bridle

  look out jimmy he yelled this
horse is some quick breaker as they say
he was actually smiling thought the
astounded lane

  if i dont hit any trees i ought to be in
ocean breeze inside of fifteen minutes

  he kicked the animal smartly in the ribs
and lane jumped aside in the nick of time

  hell be there in five minutes mur-
mured lane gazing after the swirling cloud
of dust

chapter xiv

the lynching

  it was at the railroad crossing half way
to ocean breeze that crandall perched
precariously on the flying jess first heard
the clattering hoofs and cries in the dis-
tance there came too muffled reports of
shots he threw all his two hundred
pounds of bone and muscle into a mighty
tug and the mare faltered then halted with
an abruptness that all but threw crandall
over her head down the road before him
came a swiftly moving blur the blur be-
came a horse and rider and behind him
came other blurs there were staccato re-

ports and little puffs of white smoke flo
briefly in the intervening air

  the quarry hung low over the horse
neck as it swept nearer the crossing 
contour of the rider became distinct ar
crandall saw it was the old negro jim he
knew that it would be almost impossible for
the rider to check his mounts speed before
the crossing was reached as they came
clattering on crandall held his breath
sensing the inevitable an hour before he
had been experiencing much the same sen-
sation as must be upon the fugitive now as
he saw the rails before him

  the horse as fear crazed as its rider
fairly shot its foam flecked body over the
intervening space the first rail was
cleared safely a flying hoof caught in the
second and then-crandall shuddered as
horse and rider crashed to the ground roll-
ing over and over before they lay still
almost at the feet of crandalls whinnying
mare

  crandall quickly dismounted stooping
over the tangle as the pursuers came clat-
tering up the horse recovering from the
shock was trying frantically to make its
feet but a dangling leg prevented it it
had rolled over the body underneath which
lay grotesquely sprawled as it had fallen
he heard the mob riding up and noisily
dismounting-their hard breathing and
mingled oaths came to him confusedly the
late arrivals were pushing forward around
him eager to be in at the death his pres-
ence seemed almost ignored as they crowd-
ed around pushing jostling each other in
an effort to view the still body on the
ground he saw that there were about
thirty of them-the gang of idlers from the
railroad station being well represented
the composite expression on their sweaty
faces filled with the lust to kill would have
made the artist who could have caught it
on a canvass sam bass his arm crudely
bandaged shoved his way through the
press until seeing crandall he stopped at
a respectful distance and contented himself
with a muttered oath

  not so another of the gang who prodded
the prostrate body with his foot

  dead is he he looked up at crandall

  crandall caught his disappointment and
shouldered him contemptuously aside
the skyrocket



  keep your feet off him he shot out

  jheres the sheriff

  there was an ominous silence-the
more distinct from the noisy babel before

  he man crandall had shouldered made a
ruculent move forward and crandall
braced himself with something akin to
pleasure waiting the expected attack but
there came an interruption from another
quarter someone pushed from the rear
through the crowd and stood between cran-
dall and the other

  got the nigger eh there was an au-
thoritative ring in his voice who shot
him 

  he struck the railroad crossing and fell
explained crandall are you the sheriff

  yep answered the other

  there was an impatient murmur from the
crowd as the prostrate body began showing
signs of life the dickering irritated them
this was not what they had ridden like mad
for two miles for they pressed forward
anxious for the real sport to begin

  this man is badly hurt said crandall
reading their faces cant we rush him
back to ocean breeze and get him a doctor
before you lock him up

  a chorus of hearty guffaws greeted him
bringing an angry flush to his face the
sheriff stared at him open-mouthed

  say he snorted thats a bad nigger
hes cut a white man who are you any-
way

  oh who  am doesnt matter crandall
answered coolly enough im the editor of
the paper at ocean breeze-most of these
men know me this negro is an employee
of mine ill be personally responsible for
him

  he stooped down as he spoke and raised
jim to a sitting posture the old negro
slowly opened his eyes with a long drawn
out groan there was a nasty cut over
one eye and blood was trickling from a bul-
let wound in his shoulder at sight of the
mob surrounding him he made a frantic
effort to regain his feet and failing clung
terror-stricken to crandalls leg pain and
fear struggling for mastery in his face

  help me boss-help me he begged
piteously

  the sheriff stepped over to him and
grasped him roughly by the arm

  come on nigger he commanded
we done had enough trouble with you for
one day

  he stopped suddenly looking over at the
fallen horse which neighing pitifully was
still making spasmodic efforts to regain its
feet

  by caesar he exclaimed a horse
thief too eh thats fred hightowers
gray he shook jim roughly regardless
of his wounds you sure are a no account
nigger that there was one of the best sad-
dle horses in this yere county he drew
his revolver as he spoke and taking careful
aim fired the horse gave a convulsive
jump and then lay still

  that poor little grays been sufferin all
this time while we been foolin with you
he shook jim again if fred knew that
hed surely be mad at me

  he turned to the crowd

  hightowers gray he said angrily in-
dicating the dead horse with the butt of his
gun

  there was a threatening murmur from
the others and one or two made a move to-
ward the sheriff and his captive crandall
who had said nothing stood close to the old
negro ready to ward off the blows he ex-
pected would come he saw that the men
would wait little longer for their prey
most of them had been drinking heavily
and the chase while it lasted had been hot
and hard their impatience was growing
momentarily what had looked like prom-
ising sport was in danger of being spoiled
there was a new concerted movement to-
ward the sheriff

  now boys began the latter mildly
lets take this easy and regular come
here you bass

  sam bass came forward to the edge of
the crowd leering evilly at crandall

  that the nigger that cut you inquired
the sheriff

  bass loosed a foul oath and swung his fist
at the cowering jim

  thats identification aint it the sher-
iff chuckled turning to crandall not wait-
ing for an answer he led his horse forward
by the bridle and jerked jim brutally to his
feet

  get up there nigger he commandd

  jim cast an appealing glance at crandall


short stories

and essayed painfully to climb into the sad-
dle

  oh go on-git up shouted the sheriff
testily slapping the old negro resoundingly
on his bent back

  the crowd yelled its unmeasured ap-
proval it was the blow that snapped the
restraint that crandall had held on himself
-his studied coolness fell away from him
abruptly he advanced swiftly to the sher-
iffs side unmindful of the fact that he was
an alien and alone that he was not only op-
posed to men-he was entering the lists
against the primitive desire to kill

  that man is badly hurt he shot out
his voice quivering with half-suppressed
rage he can scarcely stand he is half
dead now from pure fright if you hit him
again ill give you a lacing youll never for-
get and i can do it before your fellow curs
can pull me off

  crandall had never witnessed such a curi-
ous battle of emotions as took place on the
sheriffs face white rage fell before an
ochre streak that ran somewhere in his
body he made a quick movement with his
gun but crandall stood his ground tower-
ing over him his left arm ready and aching
to send over the blow the crowd pressed
and jostled around them but strangely
enough there was no movement toward him
jim slumped against the side of the horse
half conscious the sheriff reading the
tense expression on crandalls face his
huge bulk poised lightly on the balls of his
feet mumbled under his breath and dropped
his hands to his sides

  crandall felt more disappointed than ex-
ultant at his victory

  i got a good notion to take you in too
began the sheriff in a half whine you
better keep out of this

  he turned again to jim

  get up he commanded again

  this time jim crawled somehow on the
back of the horse on the instant some-
thing whizzed through the air and settled
around his shoulders the something re-
solved itself into a long twisting coil of
rope and pulled taut it held jim securely
a series of hdarse maniacal yells went up
from the crowd the sheriff stood aside
and watched complacently crandall felt
the hot blood tingling in his veins

  yeres the tree came a voice from t
rear of the crowd

  crandall bent down and spoke in the
sheriffs ear almost shouting to be heard
over the pandemonium around him

  youre not going to let them lynch him
are you

  say the sheriff turned on him bluster-
ingly what are you messin in yere all the
time for theres twenty of them and
theres one of me i cant stop em can i
if wed let that pass over him cuttin bass
them niggers at the lumber camp would
turn your little ole town inside out next pay
day when they liquor up that nigger ex-
pects whats cornin to him its the onliest

way you can teach em anything-

  youre going to let them do it cried
crandall unheeding

  jim was lost in the swirl of the crowd
crandall heard his agonized yells though
and they cut through him like a knife as he
railed at his helplessness the mob had
seemingly gone stark raving mad now as
they stumbled along the road to the tree an
outrider had selected there was no human
semblance to their ear-splitting yells and
crazy actions now and then someone car-
ried away by the blood lust and cheap
whisky with which they had been plenti-
fully supplied-the one at birth the other
too soon after would empty his revolver in
the air

  by heaven cried crandall shaking
his fist at the mob im ashamed of my race
when i look at that scum ill go to the
governor of the state with this you dont
even know why that poor old negro cut
bass you dont want to know ill make
it my business to see that every one of that
cowardly mob is punished for this

  if you all feel like that returned the
sheriff you better git back north as fast
as you can bass says he cut him thats
good enough besides if he didnt do that
he probably did somethin else

  straining his eyes eagerly crandall saw
that through the widening circle of the
crowd around the tree that the noose had
been placed around jims neck he was
still astride the horse his head touching the
mane as he slumped forward unconscious in
the saddle a score of revolvers flashed in
the sunlight ready for the real sport when
the skyrocket



 negros body swung dangling as the
orse would be sent out from beneath him
jrandall ground his teeth impotently watch-
ing for the signal that would swing jim into
eternity

  something was coming down the road in
a cloud of dust and sand-an automobile
horn honked noisily at the homely sound
a great wave of homesickness swept over
crandall he longed fervently to be back
mingling with the crowds in times square
drawing on the gloves while the calcium
overhead stung his eyes and the thick to-
bacco smoke choked his lungs back for the
daily dropping in at the press office away
from the bestial horde that found vociferous
enjoyment in the killing of a fellow being
not in fair combat but like a rat

  a high-powered touring car came into
view two men were standing up in the
tonneau while a third sat at the wheel
crandall ran forward determined to halt
the car and appeal to them for aid but
there was no need for his action the car
stopped suddenly on the fringe of the crowd
there was a wild scurrying for horses hats
fell off and were left forgotten the man at
his side was also struck by the sudden de-
sire for flight he ran to his horse with an
oath leaped astride it and spurred fran-
tically crandall bewildered by this new
turn of affairs saw that the men in the car
had jumped from the running board and
were hurrying toward the tree the horse
pricked up its ears at their approach and
stepped from under jim

  crandall reached the body almost as soon
as the newcomers one a brawny individ-
ual held jims body so the rope would be
slack while another slashed at it with his
knife they laid the negro on the ground
under the tree and straightening up stared
suspiciously at crandall

  my name is crandall he addressed the
brawny one im the editor of the paper in
ocean breeze and this old fellow worked
for me i was in kissimmee when i heard
those men were after him i came up just
as they caught him i tried to get the sher-
iff to stop it but-

  he stopped noting the indulgent smile on
the others face

  the boys have been fooling you his
listener said smiling good naturedly im

bout the only sheriff around here i reckon
he threw open his vest displaying the star
pinned to his shirt my name is elkins

  crandall gasped

  theyre a great bunch continued the
other shaking his head i reckon that was
ed harkness that told you all he was me
hes done that before regular little trick
of his

  he motioned to the body at his feet

  guess im too late-this here nigger is
sure enough dead he said

  he turned to his companion

  joe-this is mister crandall-joe john-
son one of my deputies he explained for-
mally to crandall who grasped the others
hand joe went on the sheriff jump in
that there car and go after ed harkness-
you ought to meet up with him right at the
edge of kissimmee if that there salesman
told the truth about that auto get him and
take him on to the court house if judge
brice is there get you some bench warrants
and go after sam bass chick hertell and
herb rollins them bein all i got sight of
before they scattered get ferd to hitch up
and come out yere right off for me and this
nigger

  the sheriff squatted on the ground and
drew a sack of tobacco from his pocket of-
fering it first to crandall

  now he said rolling a cigarette if
you all will tell me something about all
this he waved a hand to the negros body
ill fix up some way of sendin them boys
away for a time not on account of this-
couldnt git no court to do that-but im
sure gittin tired of that no account ed
harkness goin around tellin strangers hes

chapter xv

the inquisitive mr simms

  the dry humor and unaffected good
nature of the sheriff were irresistible to
crandall and that official in turn found
something in common in crandalls huge
bulk and boyish enthusiasm it was not
strange then that in a few minutes after
their odd meeting the two were conversing
as life long friends-exchanging experi-
ences confiding hopes the sheriff was
especially interested in crandalls prize ring
exploits viewing him with the admiration


short stories

of one big man for another and crandall
found he had enlisted a valuable and willing
ally when he briefly outlined his suspicions
of the fraud at ocean breeze

  as far as that there guard on the office
is concerned said the sheriff when cran-
dall had broached the question i got an
order from judge brice for that youll have
to see him to get the answer but hes a
fine old man and hell sure help you when
he hears that yarn you told me ill put in
a good word for you too but im going to
find out who sent you that trick telegram
that theres right in my line

  they parted at length with the under-
standing that they were to confer again the
next morning at kissimmee and crandall
mounting the somewhat chastened jess
rode back to ocean breeze making directly
for the tribune office he at once caught
out williams his printer eager for the de-
tails of the row between sam bass and jim
his story was about what crandall had ex-
pected bass exceptionally intoxicated had
come to the office and finding crandall
away had launched into an uproarious dis-
sertation upon the latters past present and
possible future in language couched in in-
expressible filth jim had attempted to
soothe him and make him leave quietly and
bass seizing eagerly the longed-for oppor-
tunity had knocked the old negro down
with a swing of his ham-like fist unsati-
ated he was kicking him brutally when jim
suddenly pulled a clasp knife from his
pocket-old and rusty it was a pitiable
rather than formidable weapon pain-
maddened he made a feeble lunge at bass
-the blade scratched the others arm who
reeled from the office yelling lustily jim
fled while the crowd was still collecting
that was all he knew about it

  crandall then recounted the events lead-
ing up to the death of the old negro expect-
ing an indignant outburst but williams took
what crandall thought the most revolting
thing he had ever witnessed as a matter of
course and seemed vastly more interested
in the possible fate of harkness who had
impersonated the sheriff

  crandall turned from the other disgust-
edly and glancing out the open window his
eyes fell upon a picture that swept all the
unpleasant thoughts from his mind and

made his blood tingle miss stevenson a
old mr simms were passing on the opposii
side of the road the girl was leaning 
the old veterans arm and appeared deeply
interested in his earnest conversation the
old soldier bent and gray but still the gal-
lant stepped unhesitatingly into a huge mud
puddle that his fair companion might pass
the spot unsoiled the girl a bewildering
vision in a glove-fitting creation of white
turned to him remonstratingly and cran-
dall felt the blood mounting to his temples
as he drank in the beautiful lines of her ex-
quisite figure

  it was with difficulty that he brought his
thoughts back to the matter on hand but he
flung himself down at his desk and idly
picked up some letters brought by williams
from the first mail the very first one
helped him throw off his lassitude even
though he but glanced at the envelope he
straightened up suddenly and ripped it open
expectantly under the letter head of the
osceola land company he read

  mr thomas crandall esq

    ocean breeze fla

  dear sir

     as soon as possible after the receipt of
  this communication you will report to
  the new york office for some important
  instruction that cannot be transmitted by
  mail

    leave the tribune in charge of your
  printer and bring all books and corre-
  spondence relating to the companys busi-
  ness with you

  it was signed in hermances sprawling
hand

  crandall carefully folded up the letter
put it in his coat pocket and closed down his
desk he stood in the doorway for a mo-
ment deliberating taking out the letter as
he did so and reading it again slowly then
having apparently made up his mind he
strode back into the pressroom and beck-
oned to williams

  how do things look williams he
asked will we get away all right to-day
with the paper

  well answered williams if we dont
break a roller or something we ought to run
some of them off
the skyrocket



  they both walked over and stood by the
ncient press harkness had scornfully re-
ferred to it on several occasions as a junk
ile and the appellation had been conclu-
sively adequate-it was of a type that had
been obsolete ten years before

  well run off as many as we can to-day
anyhow said crandall finally if she

breaks down dont worry-

  he was about to add we wont need it
any more but thinking better of it he
stopped and walked out of the room leav-
ing williams puzzled by his cryptic un-
finished utterance

  unable to throw off his growing nervous-
ness caused by his mental struggles to
fathom the meaning of hermances letter
crandall started for the railroad station to
await the arrival of the train from kissim-
mee bearing lane as he strode along he
turned over the situation again and again
in his mind that hermance was crooked
and that the colonists were being defrauded
he had no doubt but what the scheme was
he could not grasp even the faintest inkling
here was a fresh obstacle and added ele-
ment of mystery in that hermance had or-
dered him back to new york

  he greeted thad newell at the station
perfunctorily and stood idly watching him
checking up his invoices

  thad he said abruptly who owned the
land around here before the osceola com-
pany bought it

  he wondered at newells sudden start
and the keen glance he turned on him at
the question something of his surprise
must have shown in his face for thad
hastily returned to the invoices going over
the last one before he answered

  i reckon it belonged to the state he
said finally why

  whether it was newells tone or the
words themselves crandall couldnt decide
but somehow he got the idea that the other
was fencing but though he stared quite
frankly into the others face he could read
nothing there

  further discussion was cut short by the
whistling of the train and crandall went out
on the platform as it labored noisily into the
station he walked along beside the cars
and lane swinging down from a step almost
bowled him over the latter seized cran-

dall and swung him around relief showing
in his face

  well apparently you are all here he
exclaimed as if he had had grave doubts of
finding such the case did the lynching go
through

  crandall related his experiences as they
walked back to the tribune office lane
listening in interested silence to every de-
tail

  some afternoon he ejaculated when
crandall had finished tommy you are
getting to be a regular movie hero i-

  what would you do about that letter
from hermance interrupted crandall
anxious to rid himself of the tangle fore-
most in his mind

  oh forget that answered lane quickly
stall him off for a few days why we
should have this all cleaned up by the end
of the week he went on with an enthusi-
asm that made crandall smile in spite of
himself this stillman is the fellow if we
can only get to him it can be done you
know no man is invulnerable to all as-
saults the thing to do is to find how to get
him i knew he had gotten word to new
york thats why hermance has called you
off ill bet

  have you formed any theories as to
what will be printed conspicuously on the
warrant they arrest hermance with asked
crandall with a jocularity he did not feel

  not as yet confessed his friend as
they walked up the steps of the tribune of-
fice but i think that-hello whats this

  he paused suddenly as he pushed for-
ward the door into the office crandall
stepped swiftly to his side peering in the
darkened room his exclamation of aston-
ishment was excusable for old mr simms
was bent over his desk in the act of forcing
it with a brass rule which he had evidently
picked from a box on the floor he straight-
ened up quickly at lanes exclamation and
faced them with a magnificent assumption
of ease

  you must have the jewels of asia or
something as valuable hidden in this pesky
old desk he remarked cooly to crandall
ive been trying to open it for ten min-
utes

  the very unexpectedness of the words
and the assurance with which they were


short stories

spoken stunned crandall and he stood in
the doorway unable for the moment to re-
ply at lanes cough he stepped into the
room and still without speaking lit the
lantern then he turned and faced simms

  what were you trying to get out of my
desk mr simms he asked sternly

  from inside came the rattle of the old
press grinding out the weekly output of the
tribune

  i met that fool printer of yours up the
road began the old man without the faint-
est trace of embarrassment  was right
anxious to get a copy of the tribune as soon
as she came from the press you know i
sent that little piece about the g a r
meeting in and i clean forgot to put the
date in it he told me the article was still
on your desk and i come right down here to
fix it up  didnt want to be no laughing
stock by having it in without no date well
of course you were gone when  got here
and i thought to myself sam-if you dont
get that and fix it right its going to get in
the paper that way and-

  crandall broke in angrily on the old
mans ramblings

  and you were breaking in my desk to
get it eh he said sarcastically

  but his anger was lost on simms

  see that little piece of paper stickin out
there he pointed to a corner of the desk
that looks all fired like the paper i sent
in i thought if i just raised the corner a
leetle mite i could pull it out

  he stopped looking searchingly from
crandall to lane and quick to catch the
skepticism reflected on the features of both
he threw back his bent shoulders proudly

   got three bullets there he said with
dignity he tapped his right leg lightly at
gettysburg before you were born i had
my own command at santiago-i aint
never been called a thief yet- his in-
dignation was so genuine as he stood be-
fore them with flashing eyes-old and bent
but no whiner-that crandall felt a sudden
tinge of shame creep over his anger

  but you know yourself mr simms
he began in a milder tone it looks very


  williams grimy perspiring stuck his
head in the door

  i think well get through all right this

time boss he called to crandall then s
ing the others he stopped

  all right williams thats fine cranda
called back over the rattle of the pres
oh wait a minute did you notice a stor
about the g a r meeting in the form
it should be on the front page

  i think i did answered williams
well give mr simms here a paper
he turned to the old veteran if youll
step inside mr simms williams will give
you a paper and you can see if your notice
is all right

  the old man hobbled inside after wil-
liams without a word

  crandall turned to lane at the others
sneering laugh as the door closed after
simms

  well what do you think he cried
hurry up-say it

  why didnt you ask williams while they
were both here if he had met this old man
up the road-wasnt that what he said
crandall slapped the desk with his hand
why didnt you remind me he ex-
claimed quickly i was so impressed by his
injured innocence that i felt as though i
were the guilty one i know williams
hasnt been out of this office

  he stepped over to the door

   heres where i clear up this mystery at
any rate he said grimly

  as he feared there was no sign of simms
when he strode into the pressroom he
climbed up on the press beside williams

  were you out of the office while i was at
the railroad station he yelled to make
himself heard over the din and rattle of the
rollers

  williams turned to him indignantly
  me certainly not why it took me

fifteen minutes to get the forms-

  all right crandall cut him off thats
all i wanted to know wait-where did mr
simms go

williams pointed to the door at the rear
crandall nodded understandingly and
climbed down he returned to the office
and found lane pacing impatiently up and
down

  he never saw him inquired the latter
before crandall could speak

  crandall nodded

  you win he said
the skyrocket



  sure-i knew it declared lane then
 went on briskly well were becoming
cquainted with the whole crowd now but
s leave the old fellow alone for the time
eing if you make a fuss about him now
ou might queer the whole business weve
got to start at the beginning and the whole
thing will work out naturally let him
think he got away with it the more secure
they feel the sooner theyre apt to get care-
less meanwhile youll simply have to get
into that office at the lake and get hold of all
the books and papers you can find if we
can only do something that will get them to
bargain with us-we can clean up in no
time

  ill go down there to-night announced
crandall suddenly im sick of this infer-
nal mystery-people prying in my desk and
sending fake telegrams and all the rest of
the bowery melodrama ill go down there
and break in some way and get hold of
something then if we cant do anything
with what i bring back ill go over to kis-
simmee to-morrow and see what i can do
with stillman if we fall down all around
im going up to washington and let the fed-
eral authorities know what scant informa-
tion we have

  i cant say i like the last part said
lane because i think we can get to the
bottom of this without calling in uncle
sam it certainly will make my story better
if we do however well try out the other
first anyhow

  wait until i see what kind of a paper i
have this week and well bustle up to the
villa for supper said crandall theres
no reason why we shouldnt eat-mystery or
no mystery

  righto agreed lane hurry up
crandall stepped inside and picked up a
copy of the tribune still damp from the
fly in front of the press then he re-
joined lane and the two started for the
villa

  the dining room was deserted as it was
long past the supper hour but as they took
their places at the table miss stevenson
passed out from the kitchen and greeting
both pleasantly went on outside crandall
sat staring after her until lane reminded
him sarcastically that they were sleeping at
the tribune office and not at the villa lor-

raine he ate sparingly planning mentally
his intended invasion of the shack by the
lake that night not so lane who insisted
on a second helping of rice pudding of
which he was inordinately fond crandall
pushed his chair away from the table and
stepped out the doorway to wait for lane
when his friend firmly refused to forego
his craving for the dish

  standing within a few feet of the house
almost concealed by the shadows he saw
the girl he drew a deep breath and wished
devoutly that lane would consume at least
a dozen plates of rice pudding-or anything
that would detain him inside

  the girl was gazing pensively over the
semi-wilderness of sand thrown into start-
ling relief where the moonlight caught it
she seemed quite unconscious of his near-
ness and crandall gazing at her beautiful
profile was loath to disturb the picture but
she defined his presence suddenly and
turned with an apologetic gesture cran-
dall thrust blindly for an opening

  i am returning to new york shortly
miss stevenson he began hurriedly and
i-

  the girl stopped him with a swift gesture
and came toward him

  you are going to-morrow

  there was an intenseness in the question
strange in itself that startled crandall

  why-no he groped i hadnt thought
of leaving as soon as that why to-mor-
row he finished inanely

  mr crandall said the girl seriously
unless you have already made plans-no-
even if you have made plans will you delay
your trip to new york until the day after
to-morrow 

  crandall was bewildered but there was
no mistaking the earnestness of the girl
her whole attitude was tense this was no
coquettish fencing whatever the reason
crandall saw the girl was waiting his an-
swer with patent anxiety

  of course he answered i would de-
lay it indefinitely at your bidding he ad-
ded smiling in an effort to relieve the
situation

  but there was no answering smile in the
girls features and at that moment lane ap-
peared in the doorway at his call to
crandal whom he did not see immediately


short stories

the girl stepped quickly past him and into
the house

  crandall turned testily to lane as the
latter joined him

  you came along at an infernally inop-
portune time jimmy he said

  lane chuckled

  youll have lots of time for that sort of
thing after we solve hermance he said
just now lets figure out how youre going
to work this second-story act to-night

chapter xvi

the bolt from the blue

  at something after eleven that night
crandall floundering around in the thick
brush in the rear of the companys office at
the lake decided for the fifth time within the
hour that the moment to act had come his
nerves had been on the ragged edge since
he had sought the cover of the shrubbery
on his arrival there the guardian of the
office lay as he had hoped prone on the
step his shot gun flung near him on the
ground his deep snores all but drowning the
whine of the innumerable mosquitoes and
the rattling chorus of crickets had it not
been for the noise issuing from the throat
of the sleeper crandall would have thought
the man dead for a tentative stone tossed
near him had skidded off a rock resting
finally within an inch of his upturned face
the man had simply brushed a hand over his
head impatiently and the snores went on
unbroken

  crandall carefully groped his way around
the shack until he found a window he
exerted a slight pressure on the frame and
found it locked as he anticipated and he
drew from his pocket a screw driver
brought for the purpose inserting it gin-
gerly into the scant space between the bot-
tom of the window and the sill he bent on
it suddenly and then-

  the entire lower panel of glass fell out
of the frame and dropped to the floor inside
with a jangling crash a shadow flitted
about near the open window as he watched
his heart racing he crounched down be-
side the aperture waiting the discovery he
expected momentarily his muscles tense
his whole body poised for the spring

  but there came no attack-the silence

was unbroken save for the uninterrupti
chorus of the insects about him and the gu
tural snore of the guard crandall coula
not believe that the latter had not bee
awakened by the crash and he straightenei
up cautiously feeling his way around the
side of the house he had progressed in
this fashion perhaps a dozen feet when he
heard a soft thud as of a body striking the
ground near the window he had just left and
he wheeled around in time to see a figure
disappearing in the shrubbery without
hesitation crandall plunged in after it

  he stumbled blindly along following the
others course by the swaying of the shrub-
bery before him low-hanging branches
cut and scratched his face and more than
once a clammy feeling shook him as he
stepped and slid on slimy things underfoot
once he flung full into a hidden gully-he
saved himself by a spasmodic clutching at
a firmly rooted weed lanes phantasy
kid imagination gave him a hard battle
as he stumbled along in the darkness but he
conquered it as he had before with the
scorpion the figure ahead appeared to be
widening the distance between them despite
his best efforts he knew though that soon
they must strike the edge of the town there
was a clearing there and-he squared his
jaw grimly

  he came onto the open road suddenly
and straining his eyes he made out his
quarry scurrying along perhaps fifty yards
ahead half hidden by the darkness he fol-
lowed swiftly increasing his pace then
slackening it when the fugitive flung a
glance behind over his shoulder as they
neared the railroad station crandall de-
scribed a man step from the shadows be-
hind it and reaching out pull at the others
arm there was something strangely fa-
miliar about the newcomer-so familiar
that crandall stopped almost in his tracks
gasping the two ahead were conversing in
animated tones and abruptly one turned
facing him gesticulating vehemently the
flickering light from the lamp post fell full
upon their faces crandall staggered back
against the tall pine where he had stopped
his brain reeling his blood pounding
through his veins it was a woman he had
been pursuing it was miss stevenson

  dazed crandall saw that her companion
the skyrocket



  mr simms-not the bent and quaver-
  old soldier but a strangely erect almost
  etic mr simms that bent over the
  man with an air of tender proprietorship
  at gripped crandalls heart

  there was no mistaking his identity-he
till wore the g a r uniform the flowing
white beard the old-fashioned spectacles-
and crandall saw as they hurried up the
road from the station that he fell back into
his limping gait as if from the long perfect-
ed habit

  crandalls first impulse after the first
shock was to rush after the pair and demand
an explanation he even took a few strides
forward with this intent and then halted
they could not leave town until morning
and now that disclosure was certain a con-
ference with lane might bring better re-
sults than a hasty action of his own in his
present temper one thing was sure now
he told himself the entire mystery would
be cleared up in the next twenty-four hours
he shuddered if lane had seen what he
had and repeated it to him he would have
knocked him down for the telling but this
he had observed with his own unbelieving
eyes a midnight rendezvous with simms
simms who was an impostor-playing the
role of the old veteran perhaps as his part
in the big scheme he had caught him at
his desk but a few hours before and had
been so deceived by his artistry in the part
that he had let him go-apologizing

  but it was the thought of the girl being
involved that swept over crandall making
all else mere detail her studied avoidance
of him previous to the tragedy at randalls
island her cryptic remarks her earnest re-
quest that he delay his leaving and then
this-

  when he flung open the door of the tri-
bune office he found lane dozing in the
jhair at his desk but the noise of his en-
trance awakened the latter who sprang up
eagerly rubbing his eyes

  what luck he cried

  crandall perched himself wearily on the
side of the desk

  jimmy he answered if this thing isnt
solved by to-morrow ill go clean off my
head when i tell you what i saw to-night
youll think me so now

  great stuff declared lane all atten-

tion hurry up and get it off your chest
youll never find a better listener

  crandall detailed his experiences from
the time he had left the office and the ex-
pression on lanes face as he finished was
a tribute to his descriptive powers

  i knew it he ejaculated when cran-
dall paused i knew that girl was mixed up
in this somehow if i had only gone with
you as i wanted to-night she is certainly

  please forget that part of it will you
crandall shot out irritably his nerves dan-
gerously near the breaking point never
mind what you knew what do you know
now what will we do

  lane smiled indulgently at his friend

  all right old man hold your temper i
know how you feel you were wise not to
start anything to-night well spring this in
the morning and well spring it right be-
lieve me you go over in the morning and
get that sheriff here and well round this
bunch up tell what we know and demand a
showdown

  yes answered crandall sarcastically
and suppose there is nothing to show
down

  youre crazy declared lane irritated in
turn even if there was nothing else the
idea of that girl breaking in the office will
call for some explaining wont it

  crandall sighed and nodded almost re-
luctantly

  thats our only card so far he agreed

  it was an hour later before the two turned
in but there was little sleep for crandall
although lane went off into a sound slum-
ber almost immediately as far as outward
appearances were concerned crandall
finally dozed off but not until the first gray
streaks of dawn were showing over the
pines he was aroused by lane shaking
him vigorously

  hurry up its nearly seven oclock
came booming into his ear youll have to
hurry if youre going to make that train to
kissimmee youd make a fine sleuth you
would

  crandall with a supreme effort shook off
his sleepiness and fatigue he rose and
went to the water barrel sprinkling the cold
liquid on his face and shoulders in generous
quantities after a brisk rub with the towel


short stories

he felt somewhat fresher and thoughts of
what the day would bring acted as an addi-
tional stimulant he could scarcely believe
that the events of the night before had ac-
tually transpired now in the light of the
glorious morning it seemed more like a par-
ticularly vivid dream

  lane paced around the office nervously
as he dressed holding his watch in his hand
and looking from it to crandall frequently
williams and his aides came straggling in
the former dropping some letters on cran-
dalls desk crandall reached for his hat
and stuffed the mail in his coat pocket he
paused in the doorway and turned to lane

  dont make any breaks up there he
nodded in the direction of the villa lor-
raine until i get back-unless it cant be
helped he said significantly

  say lane retored indignatly what do
you think i am an amateur at this game
hurry up youll miss that train

  crandall found that lanes fears were
well founded for as he stepped outside he
heard the three sharp blasts that preceded
the departure of the train for kissimmee
it was only by brisk sprinting that he man-
aged to fling himself on the step of the last
car

  settled in a seat he thought of the mail
and drew the letters from his pocket a
glance at the first caused him to replace the
others at once there was a well remem-
bered twist to the ts and a familiar repe-
tition of undotted is that made him tear
open the envelope and glance for confirma-
tion at the signature it was signed your
old pal and manager dan bagley

  the message from the man who had
started and stopped crandalls career as a
prize fighter was brief and to the point
bagley had discovered crandalls where-
abouts-never mind how he wrote and
it was the last paragraph of his letter that
held crandalls attention

  the ten round no decision game is
great around new york now wrote bagley
in his almost undecipherable chirography
i can get you as many fights as you can
take anybody is liable to pull a bone-
thats what i did when i let you out for-
get about that and come up here and gather
in some of this easy dough ill give you
a better split than i did before and we will

probably roll in it in a few weeks ii
are shy let me know at once and ill
you some change

  crandall considered this letter all t
way over to kissimmee at first blush
was a ray of sunshine in the dark clouc
that enveloped him there would be noth
ing for him in ocean breeze when the big
showdown as lane phrased it came he
would have to do something just what part
was the girl playing perhaps-hang it
why couldnt he get her out of his mind and
think of his own future lets see now-
he was practically in training and could
soon get in perfect condition again for the

ring-was simms her fiance- finding

it impossible to run his two trains of thought
on his one track mind crandall stuck bag-
leys letter in his pocket and made one firm
resolve whatever his erratic manager had
to offer him in new york this was the fight
right here and here he would stay until
it was decided and stake his future on the
result

  the train wheezed into kissimmee and
crandall was the first to leave it as he
strode from the station a sudden thought
struck and held him why not one more try
at stillman surely the effort would not
be wasted maybe as the time for the lat-
ters trial for the killing of butts-blythe
drew near he would weaken and expose the
scheme in an effort to enlist crandalls aid
as one of the two persons who had first-hand
knowledge of the shooting to save his own
skin

  the possibilities of the idea so impressed
him that he at once made for the county
jail where stillman had been confined the
warden readily admitted him and led him
to a room attached to his own quarters the
official informing him confidentially that
this privilege had been secured through the
efforts of stillmans lawyer who he assurer
crandall was the biggest of his profession
in jacksonville and was standing that yank
about one hundred dollars a day

  stillman was at breakfast when crandall
was shown into the room and he looked in
vain for some evidence of prison pallor or
hardship his former rival was ruddy
faced and smiling and he greeted crandall
with elaborate courtesy motioning him to a
chair
the skyrocket



  i suppose you have come to offer me
  ur assistance eh he inquired smiling
  if sarcastically

  crandall thought he appeared singularly
ree from the worry and strain one would
associate with a man in his plight

   have he answered gravely

  well returned stillman poising his
cup of coffee delicately  appreciate your
generous offer but  doubt if ill need any
outside aid matters are shaping them-
selves very nicely i have a little surprise
in store which i will spring at my trial
his voice trailed off as he drained his cof-
fee by the way he added how is the-
er-charming miss stevenson

  there was something in the sneering in-
flection that stung crandall so that he had
a hard time restraining his anger

  stillman he said although you are
trying to give me a different impression-
you are in a tight corner just now i am not
only speaking of your present predicament
but one that you will find yourself in-per-
haps to-night

  eh

  stillman dropped his knife and fork and
stared hard at crandall

  whats this he asked swiftly his poise
falling away from him

  crandall with much to gain proceeded
carefully

  your uncle will soon be in jail-the
whole thing is out he replied his eyes
never leaving the others face

  my uncle is going to jail stillman al-
most shouted the words for what

  it was hard to believe that his astonish-
ment was feigned

  for what he did in ocean breeze
crandall shot out rising and coming toward
stillman and unless you come through-
even if you beat the murder charge-youll
get twenty years for your part

  stillmans nonchalant air seemed to have
suddenly left him he walked to the win-
dow and stood for a moment tapping ner-
vously on the pane at length he turned
facing crandall

  youre pretty wise old top he began
cooly enough but youll never get me to
fall for anything like that let me tell you
something i guess you dont know about
the same time george h hermance is put

in jail the brooklyn bridge will get up and
walk up broadway to bronx park-and as
for the other i may as well tell you now-i
didnt kill butts-blythe

  crandall laughed contemptuously

  who did he inquired

  miss stevenson shot out stillman re-
suming his seat at the table

  crandall gasped involuntarily and still-
man laughed at his expression but the ef-
fort was strained

  oh ho he exclaimed so you were
hit too eh well i dont blame you not

a bit-

  he buttered a slice of bread at ease
again

  i think i have acted the gentleman he
went on took the-er-blame on my manly
shoulders and all that sort of thing he
chuckled but when the fair lady neglected
to pay me a visit in my lonely dungeon
he waved a hand around the room when
she failed to make a move in my behalf i

decided to tell the true story-

  crandall came back to earth

  if you think you can get away with any
story like that he said moving to the door
you must be insane just refresh your
memory until you recall that when i came
upon you that day on randalls island you
held the revolver in your hand-apart from
that you told me you shot blythe-how will
you explain those little defects

  i wont explain them answered still-
man suavely i will merely relate the true
story which runs as follows i started
away to gather some flowers for miss stev-
enson leaving her alone with butts-blythe
i hadnt proceeded more than a few feet
away when i heard a shot and a womans
scream running back i found butts-
blythe where you did miss stevenson was
standing over him with the revolver in her
hand i took it from her just before you
came running up and because of my deep
regard for her i decided to shield her by
confessing to the deed myself

  he paused with a quick covert glance at
crandall

  you will have a fine time proving that
remarked crandall sarcastically

  yes answered stillman and shell
have a fine time proving otherwise-its
fifty-fifty


short stories

  dont forget my testimony crandall re-
minded him

  stillman smiled enigmatically

  i wont he assured if you testify
what do you mean by that asked
crandall his hand on the door knob

  oh nothing replied stillman airily
not a thing

  the warden of the jail at that moment
appeared outside the half open door he
held a yellow envelope in his hand which
he extended to stillman crandall disgust-
edly turned to leave as the other opened
the envelope and he wheeled with a word
of warning that died on his lips stillman
his face ashen had sunk back in his chair
he was staring at the message as if fas-
cinated the warden alarmed stepped to
his side and the action roused stillman from
his apparent stupor

  im all right he muttered in a far away
voice fainting spell leave us alone for

five more minutes please-

  the warden stood undecided looking
curiously from crandall to his prisoner
crandall nodded to him to go and somewhat
reluctantly he walked to the door and
passed out into the little hall

  stillman took the paper in his hand and
unsteadily tore it into minute pieces then
he walked to the window and let them flut-
ter away on the breeze he closed the win-
dow carefully and faced crandall who was
watching the byplay interestedly

  you win he said weakly you called
the turn my uncle is going to jail
crandall fought hard to hide the feeling
of triumphant surprise that came over him
at the others confession he longed to
press stillman for details but he knew that
a false move now might disclose to the
other the frail foundation upon which his at-
tempt to draw him out was based as
crandall hesitated the other broke the
silence

  come back here to-night he said and
ill have something to tell you i cant now
im too unstrung ill write it out and sign
it and you can have it then i-you better

go now-

  his voice rose hysterically

  crandall heard the wardens footsteps
and left the room his brain whirling he
almost ran into the sheriffs office and found

the latter standing at his door looking
iously up and down the road

  hello-just lookin for you was
greeting heres something that beat 
all over yere he pulled something fro
his pocket and thrust it in crandalls hand
it was a telegram and crandall wondered
with a vague premonition if it would con-
tain something that would bring him the
feeling that had broken stillmans nerve
he tore open the envelope and read

    hustle back as fast as you can the
  showdown has occurred

chapter xvii

the showdown

  sheriff elkins leaned over to crandall
and yelled into the latters ear in an effort
to make his words distinct over the roar of
wind that surged past the flying auto

  makin fifty-eight miles now-be hell if
we hit somethin eh

  crandall nodded returning the sheriffs
grim smile flying particles of sand and
minute pebbles stung his face as he bent
forward tightening his grip on the sides of
his seat they took the last turn of the
road on two wheels the car rocking crazily
with unslackened speed they had only
slowed down once-at the railroad crossing
-and there crandall had drawn what he
was sure was the only breath that had es-
caped his lungs since they had sped out of
kissimmee

  as they swept into ocean breeze a
strange sight met their gaze the lower
part of the town was deserted even thad
newell was missing from the cubbyhole of
a railroad station but the tribune office
was hidden by the mass of humanity that
surged and seethed all around it the sher-
iff slowed down the car on the fringe of the
crowd

  some ride he ejaculated say
theres sure some fuss here eh

  a score of excited colonists surrounded
the auto-crandall caught a confused babel
as they crowded around

  thats one of them pull him out no

thats the editor let him alone-

  the sheriff jumped off the running
board and as crandall followed him he drew
the skyrocket



   volver from his belt holding it ready in
   hand

  open up there fellows he called out
his booming voice lets git through yere
id find out what all this fuss is about
recognizing him they made a respectful
path and crandall followed shouldering his
way through the press in the sheriffs
tracks they won their-way to the door of
the tribune office fighting through the jam
in front of the entrance the sheriff pound-
ed on the door with the butt of his gun and
a great cry went up as those in the thick-
packed inner circle of the throng recog-
nized the newcomers cautiously inch by
inch the door was opened from the inside
and the sheriff without parley inserted his
foot in the slight opening and swung it out-
ward with a mighty heave crandall fol-
lowed him as he flung inside and banged
the door shut bolting it firmly

  it was an astonishing sight that met his
eyes-a climax in itself though not a word
was spoken crandall felt that had he
studied it he could not have assembled a
stranger company than that gathered in his
office

  seated around the mailing table which
had been pulled to the center of the room
were lane-who jumped up eagerly at
his entrance miss stevenson mr simms
thad newell and three other men whom
crandall knew as representing the wealth
of the town eldridge president of the
bank wilcox the postmaster and graves
who was building the hotel framed in the
doorway eager spectators were williams
the printer and the balance of crandalls
mechanical staff

  crandall stood staring dumbly from one
to the other until the man in the g a r
uniform the erstwhile mr simms rose and
etioned him to take his chair

  sit down mr crandall he invited
pleasantly we were waiting for you he
turned to elkins you are the sheriff i
take it will you be seated also thank
you

   crandall sat stiffly in the chair until flash-
ing a quick glance at the girl he caught her
reassuring gesture-so quick it escaped the
others somehow then he felt the tension
lifting some of the impatient yelling
crowd outside were jumping up clinging to

the window sills in an effort to view the
denouement inside lane nodded inscruta-
bly to him but said nothing

  i suppose i may as well start now it
was the once bent and quavering mr simms
speaking and he accompanied the words
with a meaning nod to the others

  george h hermance he went on with-
out further preliminary is about this time
being arraigned before a united states
judge in new york on a technical charge
of grand larceny he paused there are
warrants out for eight other members of his
corporation which will be served to-day

  this young woman mr morgan here
he indicated thad newell and crandall
gasped and myself are employees of the
department of justice we have been
working just two years on mr hermances
scheme which has agitated you and your
energetic friend for about two weeks

  crandall saw by their expressions that
the others had already been acquainted with
these facts and were impatient for the other
to continue he leaned back dazedly in his
chair as the man resumed speaking

  the united states government has long
been interested in mr hermance and his
various activities he went on our at-
tention was first called to this latest by some
literature hermance sent through the mails
and by the sudden influx of tourists to flor-
ida without regard to what at some periods
was an unseasonable time of the year op-
eratives who were assigned to the case
could turn up nothing that had a suspicious
look the advertised land was here it was
all that hermance represented it to be and
the prices asked for the lots were anything
but extortionate temporarily we were
stumped

  but when uncle sam gets suspicious he
is a hard man to deceive morgan there
was procured a position with the railroad
company as assistant to the agent here he
was the first on the job i believe you met
him when you first came here

  crandall involuntarily shot a glance at
newell who returned it with a broad
smile

  miss darlington continued the other
with a gesture to the girl was sent after
a position as a stenographer in hermances
new york office in an effort to get a line on


short stories

 him through his correspondence but some
 one was before us and tipped him off so
 that plan failed i came here as mr simms
 the colonist as a veteran of the civil war
 i think youll admit  was something of a
 - success he grinned cheerfully then
 miss darlington arrived won the confidence
 of stillman and the unfortunate butts-
 blythe and through the-er-natural ri-
 valry that developed for her favor she
 grasped several important details that gave
 us a valuable lead

   you were eliminated as a possible cog
 in hermances machine though he
 laughed again through the intuition of
 miss darlington who arrayed herself on
 your side with such-er-energy that we
 dropped you from our calculations-and as
 it has proved she was right

   crandall saw that the girl a crimson
 wave flooding her face was looking away
 from him out of the window

   although i strongly opposed her doing
 so mr simms resumed miss darling-
 ton went to the companys office last night
 and obtained their books in which the land
 transactions here were recorded and other
 data it was a perilous undertaking which
 we could have avoided by simply getting a
 court order that would have turned over to
 us all the effects of the company here but
 that would have tipped off hermance and
 given him a chance to cover up just such
 occurrences in the past are what have en-
 abled him to laugh at government investi-
 gations for years

   but the disclosure of the fraud came
 from an unexpected source despite our
 labors here this was what solved the rid-
 dle and put hermance in jail

   he took an envelope from his pocket and
 drew from it a newspaper clipping which he
 handed to crandall

   that is clipped from a paper published
 in olympia oregon he explained as cran-
 dall bent his eager gaze on the crumpled
 piece of paper

   ellis blackwell once known as the
 wealthiest man in the state died here to-
 day at the age of ninety-four he read
 then followed a long chronology of black-
 wells career in a letter which mr black-
 well had mailed to his counsel last week
 he disclosed the fact that his will was in a

safe deposit box at the national ban
portland

  that was all and crandall looked
blankly

  an operative was sent to portland e
plained the other reaching for the clip
ping and a brief consultation with black
wells lawyer brought the whole scheme to
light

  blackwell you know was the owner of
the pine forest here that is now ocean
breeze hermance and his fellow crooks
negotiated with the old man two years ago
-when he had one foot in the grave they
paid him  for a ten-year option on
the land telling him they were forming a
company which would buy it old black-
well was eccentric-he was a very old man
and had no kin-also it is quite some dis-
tance from ocean breeze florida to olym-
pia oregon when hermance and his
crowd found that old blackwell had taken
to his bed with what would undoubtedly be
his last illness they got busy they sent
one of their best persuaders to the county
clerk at the town in oregon where the sale
of the option was recorded the said per-
suader presented the clerk with 
the next day the files in the clerks office
showed that the land here had been sold to
hermance outright-the word option being
gently but firmly removed

  unless the clerk jumps off the train on
the way back hell contemplate life through
the bars of a cell in atlanta for some time
to come but to return to the story her-
mance sold the timber here to the turpen-
tine company now on the outskirts of the
town they removed it themselves and
hermance netted enough from the sale to
make everything he took in later profit

  figure the rest out yourself-its easy
enough there are about  colonist
here now they have paid hermance all the
way from ten to thirty dollars an acre as the
place grew but that was a drop in the
bucket to what the gang cleaned up from
peddling shares in the future incorporated
city pretty neat little scheme eh

  he paused and surveyed his audience
there was silence for a minute then chairs
scraped back away from the table and lane
rushed over and slapped crandall on the
back
the skyrocket



     wired the press as soon as they told
  hermance was going to be pinched he
  d they have a man covering that and
  j now ill rush this along and well beat
  e town

  fine said crandall so listlessly that
lane stared at him but he ignored his
friends indignant glance and addressed the
detective

  will all these people be thrown off their
land when the time of that option expires
he inquired

  well answered the other dubiously i
suppose the government will have some
way of deciding that as old blackwell left
no kin  think though it will come out all
right no disposition of the land was men-
tioned in the will and-

  eldridge the bank president broke in
we will engage the best lawyers in the
state he asserted in fact a deputation
of the board of trade will leave for jackson-
ville to-night while another will return to
washington with the secret service men
willcox the postmaster walked to the
door opened it and faced the mob outside
he held up his hand appealingly and shortly
obtained the quiet he requested through
the open door crandall heard him and the
sheriff saying something about no vio-
lence and going to their homes-every-
thing would be all right lane had rushed
off to file his story to the press and he
heard the others going out as he sat with
bowed head trying to clear his muddled
brain

  after a time he glanced up wearily and
saw that the crowd was gradually dispers-
ing with a start he discerned the girl
standing in a corner by the window-gazing
at him with an expression he could not
define

  pardon he said hastily arising then
i suppose it would surprise you if i told
you that an hour ago i was so sure you
were mixed up on the wrong side of this
thing that i nearly went insane trying to
figure out a way i could get you clear of it
there was sudden bitterness in his tone

he saw her again at the railroad station
under the flickering lamp arguing with
mr simms

  she came slowly toward him and cran-
dall blurted out the words before he could
check them

  it is quite evident that mr simms is not
of a jealous nature

  he regretted the childish remark the mo-
ment he uttered it but the girl seemed to
take no umbrage at his bad taste instead
she stared at him wonderingly for an in-
stant-then burst into a merry laugh

  and why should he be jealous of his
sister she inquired

  sister cried crandal taking a step for-
ward his face lighting up

  it was eldridge who came upon them
then and his apologetic cough going un-
heeded he advanced into the room and sur-
veyed them smilingly the girl released
herself hurriedly-crimsoning but radiant
crandall reluctantly dropped his arms to his
side his head swam as from strong drink
he told lane afterward that he did not
know whether he was in ocean breeze or
san francisco but he had a suspicion it
was heaven

  splendid - splendid said eldridge
beaming from one to the other and now
while you are both so happy i have a prop-
osition to make mr crandall mr willcox
myself and some others have been talking
over things and weve come to the conclu-
sion that we wont be any kind of a city
when we incorporate-and we surely shall
-without a newspaper so were going to
buy the tribune

  he cleared his throat impressively

  now if youll stay along here as editor
well be right glad to have you and pay you
a salary that will leave no room for com-
plaint what do you say

  crandall felt as if the room was revolving
rapidly and he angrily smothered the rising
lump in his throat

  well he began slowly i-

  the girl put a hand over his mouth

  we accept she told eldridge
the end of the trail

by arthur preston hankins

author of dill hadleys burro bill hadleys angel unawares etc
how the nefarious scheme of a pair of claim

    jumpers was revealed by the fixing bath in a los
    angeles dark room and how a girls homestead
    was saved after a break neck race across the
    desert and a mad toboggan ride down a mountain

brinton reinhart photo-
graphic expert for the speer
sporting goods company emit-
ted a short humph of sur-
prise as his half-interested
glance caught the significance of the print
he had just lifted from the fixing bath

  he held the miniature of a spot in the
san bernardino mountains which was as fa-
miliar to him as his ten-by-ten bedroom in
the premier rooming house on third
street an uncontrollable longing a de-
pressing sense of discontent a sigh of
deepest concentration-soothing forgetful-
ness of present surroundings including his
work the city acquaintances every phase of
his busy los angeles life

  a mountain lake held the centre of the
picture on the left and on the right brown
pinon-covered hillsides swooped down to
the water level like curtains held back to
expose the view beyond between these
hills and miles in the distance rose a moun-
tain peak snow-capped and untarnished in
the foreground open sagebrush land sloped
gently to the lake with here and there a
lone sentinel pine for contrast above all
floated the white feathery clouds like tufts
of down from the wing-pits of wild ducks

  the pinon lake country forty miles from
old woman springs the summer grazing
ground of the bar-tilde outfit the four
walls of the little dark-room seemed closing
in upon him he seemed to be almost gasp-
ing for the scent of the pines and cedars
and the breath of the cows at evening sweet
with the juice of lush salt-grass

  his eyes settled on the inscription on the
lower margin the exposure had been
made with an autographic kodak and an
unmistakably feminine hand had entitled it
termino del rastro-sept  

  termino del rastro mused brinton
reinhart and prodded his rusty spanish till
it gave up the translation end of the
trail

  his own number on the back of the print
was  he dropped the limp strip of
paper back in the fixing bath and dried
his hands a half minutes consulting of his
memoranda showed him that a roll of six
exposures had been sent by mail for devel-
oping and printing by a miss marian mundy
of kingville california brinton knew
kingville a little desert town perhaps
twenty miles from pinon lake and some
four thousand feet below it

  he resumed his task eager to look upon
the other five exposures of miss marian
mundys roll

  two years before brinton reinhart had
deemed photography his lifes work now
he knew it to be a mere grub-stake pursuit
he was at that age in a young mans life
when he undergoes pronounced reversals in
thought opinion and taste he had been
raised in the land which marian mundy had
photographed since boyhood he had fol-
lowed the care-free life of a vaquero with
the bar-tilde outfit the temples and the
flying-o wintering the cattle on the desert
summering in the mountains all this hr
had left for the city to divert the current
of his life into bigger channels

  the chance to learn photography had pre-
sented itself he had followed this with
ever brightening hope till the day when his
inmost soul told him that the untrammeled
stretches of mountain and desert were call-
ing and that he must obey since then his
work in los angeles had been only a crutch
to carry him back there was a slowly
growing bank account-he was saving to
buy a piece of land where he might starve


the end of the trail



  vas true but where he would die as a
  eborn son of the soil

  another of marian mundys set was now
 the bath and he lifted it dripping from
he tray

  the picture showed a spur of the lake in
the distance another portion of the gently
sloping sagebrush land dotted with junipers
and pinons occupied the foreground miss
marian mundys stylus had entitled this
the homestead looking south

  whose homestead muttered brinton
since when thats forest reserve the
bar-tilde people have paid the government
to run cows over it for years

  the third exposure showed miss mundy
herself for on the margin was the inscrip-
tion in a small though decidedly masculine
hand marian and molly on the home-
stead sept  

  brinton found little difficulty in deciding
betwen marian and molly molly was a
long-eared loose-lipped burro with a
slough-of-despond countenance and a trout-
colored coat supporting a neatly roped
pack marian was-well brinton spent
many minutes over the likeness of marian
and many subsequent hours too for he
made for himself not only extra prints but
enlargements of her entire six

  it was perhaps the atmosphere of the pic-
tures more than marian mundys comeliness
that first aroused brintons thirst to know
her the mountains the burro with her
pack the girls rugged though neat garb-
including stetson flannel shirt divided
skirt riding boots and silver spurs-the
pony with its big california saddle which
appeared in no  of the series the camp-
wagon which occupied the background in
no  and the words the homestead
which confronted him so frequently on the
margins marian mundy was the human
feminine essence of this life for which his
heart was yearning and of course he had
pictured a mistress of the little ranch he
was to buy

  a brother had accompanied her on this
mountain trip dan mundy the feminine
scrawl had labeled him brinton knew he
was a brother because of the striking like-
ness he deduced that the two had gone
alone because they did not appear together
in a single picture

  during the lunch hour that day he
dropped into a stationery store and bought a
government topographical map of the quad-
rangle in which pinon lake was situated
he knew the exact spot from which no 
of marians series had been snapped a
short study of the map convinced him that
she had been on section  township 
north range  east when photographing
the lake now he hurried along to the land
office and thumbed the pages of tract
book  in a short time he found that on
august th  marian mundy of king-
ville california had filed a homestead
claim on a hundred and sixty acres in sec-
tion 

  he questioned the slim precise young
woman behind the counter as to homestead
entries in the national forest reserve he
was crisply referred to the act of june 
 from the legal whirlpools of which
brinton eventually contrived to hook ashore
the following information that uncle sam
had been persuaded that a certain tract in
the locality in question would be more bene-
ficial to the public as agricultural land than
as forest reserve and that consequently
several quarter-sections close to pinon lake
had been placed on the homestead-entry
list

  brinton whistled softly as he left the of-
fice wouldnt old man ramsey of the
bar-tilde outfit raise cain about this
every new homesteader in the mountains
would cut down the number of cattle the
cowmen would be permitted to run in the
national forest

  just what was brinton reinharts idea
in allowing his interest in marian mundy
to grow and flourish would have been a
hard question for him he had little hope
of ever consummating an acquaintance but
he did allow it to grow and if a man can
really fall in love with the likeness of a girl
he has never seen in the flesh brinton rein-
hart made a close approach to it

  he eagerly watched all rolls sent in for
development but it was not until the mid-
dle of november that he faced her name
again

  this time the scenes were on the mojave
desert one was of the camp-wagon with
brother dan seated on the tongue and
marian washing dishes on a bench two


short stories

bronchos and the burro nibbled at the dry
sage beyond the wagon the legend on the
margin was this on the desert waiting
for march th

  the next picture was a landscape show-
ing the level sweep of the desert stretching
to the snow-covered mountains this was
entitled what keeps us on the desert

  now he understood the brother and sis-
ter had tried to establish residence on the
mountain claim in september but had
doubtless encountered an early snowstorm
which had driven them out to camp on the
desert till spring they were allowed six
months from the date of filing in which to
establish residence march fifteenth then
was the day they were due brinton looked
again at the snow-covered mountains and
shook his head it was extremely doubtful
if there would be any chance of a load get-
ting into the mountains as early as march
fifteenth

  the succeeding exposures were all of the
desert showing the two in different phases
of their free picturesque life were they
cattle people these two if so what were
they doing with a homestead

  no more kodak work from marian mundy
came in he missed the views and their
legends it had been as if the girl had writ-
ten him confidential letters of their hopes
and disappointments of their longing to be
on the claim and delving into the soil he
enlarged other pictures which featured the
girl there was by january quite a row of
marians adorning the walls of room  in
the premier rooming house on third
street

  on a drizzly afternon toward the latter
end of january brinton was busily at work
in the dark-room as usual he had looked
through the photographic material sent in
for expert treatment for something from
marian but her name had not appeared
and the scenes amateurish and otherwise
were to him as so much clay to a potter or
lumber to a carpenter

  then almost before he was aware he
was gazing once more on pinon lake and
the gently sloping sagebrush land

  but it was a new pinon lake-another
slope the magic hand of winter had trans-
formed the limpid blue to a glittering sheet
of ice the old woman had picked her

geese above the spot and the sagebus
were little mountains of white with alluri
caves and tunnels underneath the lac
branches which no rabbit could resist t
pinons and junipers were bedecked as i
they expected santa claus to arrive at any
moment and hang glistening conceits on
their boughs

  this exposure had also been made with
an autographic camera though a size larger
than marians at the bottom was the blunt
inscription this is it

  this is what brinton snorted half un-
consciously that was marian mundys land
-he resented a strangers referring to it
as it

  fifteen was the number on the back of
the print his memorandum connected the
number  with the name guy stimson
of  higgins drive los angeles
brinton had never heard of guy stimson
but there was not a thing about guy stim-
son which he didnt dislike

  the second print showed the pinon lake
country again under the same climatic con-
ditions in the foreground were three men
bundled to the ears wearing snow-shoes
the blunt unimaginative hand had labeled
this one guy morse and jay-on the
land jan 

  number  was a view of the curtainbury
road which brinton immediately recog-
nized in spite of its covering of white this
road led from the desert to pinon lake and
was the one marian and dan would take
when they traveled to their termino del
rastro the title-genius had scratched on
the margin curtainbury road jan 
whats the answer

  corrugation settled on brintons fore-
head whats the answer what was
the answer

  number  proved to be a snow-covered
landscape-almost identical with one of
marians first set its title was baffling
fine place for snowballing about feb th

  with eyes studious and faraway brinton
dropped no  back into the fixing bath and
focused his attention on no  but both
numbers  and  were over-exposed and
total failures

  and so the book was closed

  brinton made enlargements of numbers
   and  he took them home to room
the end of the trail



  but they were not allowed the wall on
  ians side night after night he sat
   his pipe gripped between his teeth and
  t elevated to the dresser top comparing
  ducting analyzing

   the autographic inscriptions stared down
t him this one of marians set-on the
desert waiting for march th-he tried
to connect with guy stimsons fine place
for snowballing about feb th what
was this stimson doing on marians home-
stead in the middle of winter what did he
mean by reference to february fifteenth
claim jumper what chance had any one
to jump the claim unless marian failed to
get on it within the six months

  strange to relate it was not until the
night of february fourteenth that he
thought to count six months from august
fifteenth the date the land office books had
recorded as marians filing day september
october november december january
february-six months his feet came to
the floor with a bang there was some mis-
take-some misunderstanding marian was
due to establish residence not later than
february fifteenth instead of march fif-
teenth as she had written on one of her
pictures on february fifteenth the claim
jumpers would move onto the land while
marian and dan waited confidently on
the desert for better roads or they would
at least be there to witness that she had not
arrived and later would institute contest
proceedings and here it was seven oclock
of february fourteenth-with marian a hun-
dred and fifty miles from los angeles
somewhere on the bleak mojave desert

   in ten minutes he was at a telephone and
connected with a garage

  at what time can you get me to king-
ville over on the desert    seven
hours eh    bad roads you say

      how much    twenty-
five dollars all right ill be at ruggles
drug store on spring street

  it was a little after midnight when the
automobile left cajon pass and the bleak
mojave desert stretched before the trav-
elers weird by moonlight studded with its
uncannily whispering yuccas the car sped
along for mile after level mile at ten
minutes after one the driver turned to brin-
ton and announced kingville

  they passed through a small cluster of
dark houses toward a lone light bobbing
about in the uncertain distance it proved
to be in the hands of a man attending to the
birth of a wobbly-legged calf

  he did not know the mundys by name
but mention of the camp-wagon produced
results they were directed to keep the
same road for two miles and watch for the
wagon and tent on the right

  at  brinton following these instruc-
tions made out a white bulk beneath a
spreading yucca tree the car was stopped
and he wound his way through clumps of
sage and greasewood toward it a horse
snorted at his approach he stumbled over
half a bale of hay at the same time a light
flashed through the white canvas of the tent
close to the wagon

  brinton waited where he was somebody
was coming from the tent

  hello came a masculine challenge
who is it whats wanted

  brinton cleared his throat in that in-
stant he heartily wished himself in bed in
room  of the premier rooming house on
third street

  well well came the voice closer now
unmistakably insistent

  are you dan mundy was brintons
uncertain return

  yes-what is it

  i want to talk with you ive come to-
the homestead you know i think you are
likely to be jumped

  who are you

  my names brinton reinhart-from los
angeles-you dont know me

  a noticeable pause then-come on in
the tent and lets look at you

  as brinton followed dan mundy he no-
ticed even in the uncertain glow from the
tent a decided peculiarity in the mans gait
just as the tent flap was lifted a window of
the camp-wagon burst into light the two
men were scarce within the canvas eyeing
each other speculatively when a slender fig-
ure enveloped in a mans overcoat slipped
silently in behind them

  marian said dan mundy this is mr
-reinhart did you say at brintons
nod the brother proceeded hes just told
me somebody is trying to jump your claim
and i suppose was about to explain


short stories

  two dark eyes flashed a question at brin-
ton from under a great inverted birds nest
of sleep-tousled brown hair there was the
faintest smile on the girls lips the bare

v	of throat at the lapels of the large over-
coat was brown and attractive with a hand
she kept the skirts of the coat bound close
about her knees

  i heard she said

  then brother and sister waited wordless-
ly expectant eyes bent on the disturber of
their midnight rest

  brinton began haltingly felt that he was
making poor work of it then launched forth
again this time his efforts at lucidity
seemed no better so in desperation he
brought out the small kodak pictures which
he had with him but which he had hoped
might prove unnecessary to an explanation

  the girls lips formed a tantalizing o
as she slowly and bewilderedly took a print
from him brinton read the puzzlement in
her eyes and words tumbling over one an-
other told of his work with the sporting
goods company still her eyes flashed the
question why had he kept prints of her
negatives for himself he tried to lay it
to his love for and familiarity with the
country she had pictured but still the fem-
inine within her kept asking through her
eyes

  gradually though the girl and her bro-
ther began to understand the set of pic-
tures exposed by guy stimson proved the
logic of brintons statements and cleared
their minds of doubt

  now for the first time dan mundy seated
himself once more brinton detected that
peculiarity of leg movement the girl half
sat on a corner of the table one foot swing-
ing exposing the wrinkled ankle of a
huddled-on stocking

  but i filed september fifteenth she
maintained that gives us till march fif-
teenth the thumb of her right hand
tripped from finger to finger as her lips in-
audibly named them after the months the
thumb itself wiggling defiantly for march

  the land office books say august fif-
teenth said brinton

  her eyes grew troubled then she sprang
from the table wait she ordered and
vanished through the opening

  she was back soon with a paper this

she held close to the lamp bending for
till the loose hair tumbled about her f
dan she cried it is august loc
while dan obeyed she stared at brim
as if he were the author of all this mischit
mm-m dan was mumbling

  its my notification of allowance ma
rian explained it came only yesterday
theyre so poky mr stafford a neighbor
dropped it in our box last evening just as
we were leaving for winstons for dinner
then all day to-day we were over at the
wards clear up until dark i had scarcely
looked at it but i filed september fif-
teenth  know  did didnt i dan
no doubt of it her brother muttered
turning the paper this way and that as if
some new light angle might change its ac-
cusing aspect

  when you filed did you make out the
application papers brinton asked her

  no the man who located me attended to
it i signed-that was all

  a short silence set in then said brin-
ton it seems to me then that he wrote
august for september and the mistake
has gone clear through every transaction
connected with the entry its almost unac-
countable but i suppose the land office
clerks are as human as the rest of us
but surely it can be straightened out
there was pleading in marians tones

  maybe in time i suppose but it will
take time and what about the present
its the fifteenth of february right now
how is your confidence in this man who
located you

  shaky was her prompt reply weve
learned since that he is-well unreliable
to say the least

  chances are then mused brinton
that when he noticed his mistake in the
months and learned that it had been passe
by the land office he saw a chance to
double his money hes told somebody-
guy stimson and that bunch-that you
thought you were due in march but were
according to the records due in february
and hes collected another location fee to
put them on who is he

 george lee hes-

  i know him from up near old woman
springs and ill tel you something more
old man ramsey of the car-tilde has a
the end of the trail



  d in this i know the whole outfit
  msey and lee are on intimate terms
  id-

  here dan mundy apparently having de-
ided that the rays of the lamp had nothing
to do with the discrepancy in dates inter-
rupted the two

  you can win out marian in the end
but itll mean contest proceedings and we
dont want that theres just one thing to
do get up in the mountains and establish
residence within the twenty-four hours ill
follow with the outfit and well manage to
get in some way in spite of the snow itll
save a lawsuit

  you cant get in with a load said brin-
ton quickly

  weve got to thats all marian can go
horseback as soon as its light and take the
tent and some grub on the burro ill fol-
low with the team and wagon to-morrow
but why should your sister go alone
why dont you go with her establish resi-
dence then come back for the things
because of this replied the brother
slapping his thigh there was an odd flat
sound stick a pin into it if you want to
he laughed its mighty good cork-guar-
anteed not to squeak or gall

 brinton stared but-but- he

began

  oh i can straddle a caballo with the
best of em dan hurried to assure him
but im weak on the walking proposition
i can ride with her as far as yucca flat
perhaps then shell have to leave her bronk
and hike through the snow and thats
whe-e i lie down

  but she cant-mustnt go alone

  dan shrugged dont like it any better

than you do he said but-

  brinton almost held his breath as the
words came out ill go with her
brother and sister stared at the uncom-
fortable photographer a little red crept
into the girls cheeks then vanished she
turned to dan why not her eyes asked
with western disregard of all old-maid tom-
foolery

  dan laughed low and apologetically
men after all are the prudes

  ill-ill do my best brinton stumbled
on defensively she mustnt go alone i
-im all right mr mundy

  dans fine eyes bored straight through the
man of negatives for a painful moment or
two then a smile broke on his lips dog-
goned if you havent proved it he cried
go to it and take care of her boy as if
she were your sister and-and-well
thanks

  i will said brinton meekly now may

i	write a note to send back with the machine
to the store

  at dawn brinton dressed in suitable
clothes provided by dan was helping the
brother in taking down the tent and col-
lecting other articles necessary to the ven-
ture marian ready for the trip was pre-
paring breakfast over the camp stove the
smell of cornbread bacon and coffee eman-
ated from her direction and added zest to
the cool desert morning

  they were off before sunrise marian
and brinton mounted on the bronchos the
laden burro plodding ahead they took a
bee-line through the waste of sage and
greasewood toward the curtainbury road
the old familiar creak of saddle leather and
the mincing cow-pony trot of the pinto he
was astride filled the city-sick photographer
with boyish joy

  were from nevada marian opened
the conversation dan has always been a
cattleman about five years ago he reached
out too far he bought land that he found
he couldnt pay for and lost it on contract
since then weve been roaming the west
looking for homesteads and now that
weve found what we want it seems some
one is trying to beat us

  i see why you call the land end of the
trail  he observed

  yes the name fits its been a long
long trail

  what can you raise up there

  cattle weve figured it all out dan
has filed on a hundred and sixty acres where
our camp is termino del rastro is mine
well summer our cows up there and if
necessary winter them on dans place
three hundred and twenty acres dont seem
like a great deal of land for cattle raising
but our idea is to graze them only enough
for exercise

  i dont understand

  of course not youre an old-time cow-
man you cant think of raising cattle with-


short stories

out running them on thousands of acres of
grass dan and i figure that the grazing
days are about over

  listen here land in california is now
too valuable to let acres and acres of it go
to grass youve heard of intensive farm-
ing-what about intensive beef making it
takes from three to four years to produce a
marketable steer of from fourteen hundred
to seventeen hundred pounds on grass
doesnt it well our idea is to market this
same steer when hes two and a half years
old well raise wheat hay for roughage on
the mountain claim and kaffir corn for fat-
tening on the desert well feed the calves
a balanced ration right from the time they
are weaned and at two and a half years
of age well have more meat on them and
better meat than your range steer will show
as a four-year-old

  marians brown eyes were glowing with
the enthusiasm of a convert to new ideas
her round little head was crammed with
figures and statistics there was an answer
pregnant with logic for every one of his
questions she proved to him that their
three hundred and twenty acres by scien-
tific and intensive culture were equal to
fifteen hundred acres under the old order of
things he was converted before they had
reached the foothills

  id like to get a piece of land up there
he said ive been saving to get back to
the soil for two years id like nothing bet-
ter than to-well sort of go in with you
folks i love raising cattle but thought
with the small piece of land id be able to
swing it was altogether out of the ques-
tion

   not at all she affirmed

  i believe your theories are sound-

  not theories please theyve been
proved by state agricultural institutions and
by the government this is the day of
science waste and guesswork are things
of the past

  are there any more homesteads not
taken up in your locality

  theres a relinquishment joining our
claim she said this george lee holds
it he wants five hundred dollars to re-
lease it

  ive got five hundred brinton proudly
stated do you think-do you suppose-

that is how would it be you know for
to locate-well right alongside you folks
she looked him frankly in the eye
think it would be perfectly lovely she sai
they had reached the curtainbury roai
the animals were now laboring up an ever
increasing grade the air grew colder on
the canon sides an occasional patch of snow
straggled down

  toward noon they reached yucca flat a
six-mile level stretch on the mountainside
beyond this the real ascent began-up into
the snow they ate lunch rested the stock
and were away at one oclock

  it was nearly three when they stopped at
the beginning of the steep climb all above
them was snow-clad silent and mysterious
the cold breath of winter crept down the
mountainside and warned that no goose-
fleshed tenderfoot had better brave his
crystal domain

  here they left the ponies and with the
loaded burro ahead started plodding up the
frozen road there would be six miles of
this before they reached the summit then
two miles of the level mountain valley to
marians claim

  you perhaps know nothing of the old-
time trail which begins a little way from
here and runs over the peak straight to-
ward your place said brinton if it were
any other time of year id advise trying it
it would save us all of three miles mexi-
can miners built it theres an old slab
cabin where they lived on the steep rise
back of your land

  he was proceeding in this vein when they
rounded a sharp turn and came suddenly
upon a deserted canvas-covered automobile
at the roadside the owners had evidently
made the car negotiate every foot possible
of the mountain trip for the front wheels
were against the first sheet of snow they
had found covering the road

  marian said nothing but her eyes showed
that her mind was studious brinton stooped
and examined the tracks back of the ma-
chine

  this car hasnt stood here an hour he

announced i wonder if it belongs to-

  there she interrupted

  he turned to find her training a telescope
up the grade the road ahead zigzagged
from right to left along the contours on
the end of the trail



   if the shelves far above them four men
   ggled along afoot over the snow

   you look she ordered breathlessly
  ouve studied the pictures

  brinton breathed a sigh of relaxed ten-
ion after a long scrutiny of the antlike dots
reeping up the mountain

  its guy stimson and the others he
said quietly

  the girl stared at him consternation
growing in her face theyll beat us in
theyre three miles in the lead-within
three of the top

  dont worry well get there on the fif-
teenth thats all thats required

  but oh i dont want them to get there
first she cried i want to be there and
laugh at them when they come puffing in
he walked ahead a little the snow he
found was covered with a stout crust which
might support the burro but never the
greater weight of the ponies

  we must try the trail he told her
if the burro doesnt slip on the crust and
slide down with our outfit we can perhaps
make it

  the beginning of the trail was just ahead
and in a little they turned into it they had
not been on it five minutes when it became
evident that before them lay no trifling task
the trail was disappointingly steep and had
been unused so long that bushes crowded
across it and held them back the crusted
snow was slippery and disparaging

  i dont know about this puffed brin-
ton they have only about five miles to go
-two of them level we have almost three
miles of this slippery climb itll be a close
race

  its our only chance she panted back
make the most of it

  he wondered at her courage and endur-
ance it was plain to see that she labored
no harder than he did

  on and on they toiled through canons
and over stretches of immense boulders-
always upward the cold was growing in-
tense only their herculean exercise kept
them warm the sun was just bidding good-
night to the range as they reached the fall-
ing slab cabin

  below them through the snow-covered
pinon pines they saw the ice sheet of the
lake the blanket of snow which stood for

termino del rastro the forest beyond
they had only a quarter of a mile to go
down a steep slope to their journeys end

  brinton trained the glass up the lake at
once he saw four figures coming along the
shore at a tremendous speed on skis

  my lord theyve got skis at the mining
camp he cried i hadnt thought of that
why we cant get there ahead of them-

  we must come on she started run-
ning down the slope

  he felt it was hopeless but obeyed her
his first running step on the slippery hill-
side jerked his feet from under him and
he skidded along on his back for several
yards in the end he collided with the girl
and she went down with a crash breaking
the crust and sinking into the feathery snow
beneath

  brinton sat up beside her and calmly re-
marked this gives me an idea

  he rose and lifted her get the tent and
pack-bags off the burro he ordered and
struggled over the smooth crust back to the
cabin where he began wrenching at one of
the ancient slabs

  the rusty nails broke loose with a squeak
brinton chuckled as he noted that the upper
end of the slab had been beveled to fit the
roof he tore off the rotting bark and ex-
posed the smooth half-round wood beneath
he dragged the slab to where marian was
struggling with the tent and bags

  pile em on he ordered

  she shouted her comprehension as they
loaded the front end of the improvised to-
boggan with the outfit marian took the
middle brinton the rear end

  belly-buster for mine he shouted and
the next instant the astonished burro
watched them skimming down the slope

  the pinon pines and junipers were none
too thinly scattered and the clumsy sled
was hard to guide brinton worked as never
before to avert collisions the beveled end
of the slab kept it from plunging a sharp
edge into the crust and throwing them in
half a minute the tremendous speed they
had attained was little short of appalling

  but fortune favored the mad escapade
until almost at the bottom brinton in
dodging a tree collided with a stump just
thrusting a snow-capped butt from the man-
tle of white the pack shot forward over


short stories

the stump the tent landed on top of it
marian rose in the air and came down
peacefully on top of the tent brinton
riding flat on his belly skidded the length
of the slab and butted the stump with his
head

  before his stunned senses were his own
again marian unhurt was up and crying
it was perfectly lovely and we win by
half a mile up with the tent-anywhere

  they quickly connected the jointed poles
and stretched the canvas in five minutes
the tent was up wobbly it is true but rep-
resenting a residence marian bubbling
with laughter borrowed brintons pencil
and scrawled in large letters on the slab
residence established feb  -
marian mundy

  then she and brinton stood the slab be-
fore the tent door she grasped his hand
and pulled him into the trees some two hun-
dred feet away here they waited for the
claim-jumpers to arrive

  when they did a few minutes later and
stood looking in bewilderment at the tent

his pious reason

 mrs rose pastor phelps-stokes in an address in chicago once said of the extrava-
 gance of the rich

 apologists for the rich say that their wicked extravagance-their dinners at one hun-
 dred dollars a plate their fifty-thousand-dollar balls-do good to the poor well that is
 ludicrous

 that reminds me of a little boy in the country the farm where he was staying
 adjoined an orphanage there was an apple orchard behind the barn and here morn-
 ing noon and night the little boy stuffed himself gluttonously with apples

 jimmy said his mother one afternoon arent you eating rather too many apples

  but i got to ma the boy replied

 got to why his mother asked

  because the orphans need the cores he said piously

the first patient

 young doctors wife mary go and tell the doctor theres a patient waiting to see him
 maid  wish youd go maam he maybe wouldnt believe me

a study in ancestry

 artist there you are sir ive painted you a full line of ancestors and ill warrant
 you that no one will know they are not genuine this is your father thats your grand-
 father this your great-grandfather and-

 mr newrich hold on good heavens man youve made my great-grandfather a
 much younger looking man than i am

the expression on their faces repaid
watchers for their risk

  the four conversed no words came
marian and brinton then the quart
looked carefully about after which one o
them grabbed the flap of the tottery tent ana
gave it a vicious tug then came the girls
voice ringing clear through the icy still-
ness

  dont destroy property please tres-
passers will be prosecuted she burst nto
laughter as the man jumped from his tracks
looked about in guilty mystification then
led the way for the party toward the lake

  the two continued to sit behind the tree
worn out relaxing pleasurably

  my piece is-where he asked pres-
ently

  she pointed east it joins us over there

  the line will be invisible he said
lets call the whole thing termino del
rastro its the end of my trail too

  i think that will be perfectly lovely she
replied but say-why did you make those
extra prints
the brain jungle

by edward mott woolley

author of the man who disappeared etc

a wealthy woman murdered in her carriage a sister of charity
drowned as if by accident children poisoned by some mysterious
agent such was the situation when felix hazard was called in-
to the crime area of a hitherto reposeful new england town

after the fifth unaccountable
murder in litchfield the city
council met in secret session
and voted to retain felix haz-
ard whose reputation for de-
tecting well-nigh inscrutable crimes was
unsurpassed accordingly the mayor went
down to new york without informing even
the chief of police of litchfield and called
at the office of the hazard detective agency
here after a wait of two hours in an ante-
room he was shown into the little private
den of the wizard-the room so profusely
decorated with skulls and other relics of
crime hazard was there seated at a flat-
topped desk in a haze of blue tobacco
smoke with some red and green diagrams
before him

  our city of litchfield said the mayor
after formalities has until recently been
unusually free from serious crime on the
first day of june the litchfield daily times
printed an editorial boasting that two years
had elapsed since a homicide had been com-
mitted in our city but that very evening
sir an atrocious murder was done the vic-
tim being one of our most noble women
mrs agatha blauvelt a wealthy widow who
was waylaid in her electric runabout just
after dark and strangled to death she was
driving the car herself and was alone hav-
ing just visited the asylum of the inno-
cents a mile out of town she had long
been the chief patroness of this institution
to which she had contributed large sums of
money the apparent motive was robbery
though the murderer did not succeed in
getting the widows jewels evidently some-
thing happened to alarm him for he made
his escape and left the brooch and the rings
untouched yet so rapidly and fiendishly
was the crime perpetrated that the victim
seems to have made scarcely a struggle-

  hazard interrupted with a gesture you
remember that he took little interest in or-
dinary crimes with commonplace motives
nor did he waste time discussing them the
world was full of sordid deeds of violence
and his lightning-like imagination had a
habit of jumping to fantastic possibilities
if he found no range for such flights of in-
volved fancy he invariably dropped a case
at the start so now without any change in
his immobile countenance he raised his
hand and observed

  you speak of the asylum of the inno-
cents an orphan asylum i take it

  one that shelters a hundred homeless
children answered the mayor an insti-
tution founded by mrs blauvelt herself
very good said hazard proceed to
the second crime

  the second crime returned the visitor
taken aback by the others brusqueness
bears no relation to the first but is a sepa-
rate mystery if you will permit me i
should like to narrate the details of the first

murder before proceeding-

  the details can wait broke in hazard-
i have an appointment in ten minutes
the mayor who had seated himself at the
opposite side of the table looked at the de-
tective in amazement he could not com-
prehend the rapid action of hazards agile
mind and he was inclined to resent the
ungracious reception accorded him he had
some hot words on his lips but they died
away as he found the strange eyes of the
other fastened upon him there was some-
thing singularly uncanny in hazards un-
usually large and rounded orbs when they
chose to frame an illuminated interrogation
mark

  very well said the mayor curtly if
our time is so unceremoniously short i
shall endeavor to be brief the second
	short stories

crime may possibly have been an accident
but such theory is even more unexplainable
than that of murder two days after the
death of the widow blauvelt a small boy
named donaldson died in great agony after
eating some candy buttercups bought at a
local confectioners-a store patronized
largely by school children other persons
were affected but recovered a post-
mortem showed strychnine in large quanti-
ties and the confectioner was arrested he
proved that his goods were purchased of
reputable manufacturers who in turn dem-
onstrated that no strychnine was used for
any purpose in their plants where it came
from is a mystery that our police detectives

have not solved-

  quite likely remarked hazard causti-
cally the third crime

  with the question mark again burning
into his brain the mayor smothered his
anger

  the third crime he retorted had noth-
ing to do either with the first or second but
was an assassination committed apparently
for revenge one of our clergymen the
reverend dr mathewson was shot down
while entering the rear door of his church
just before the hour for evening service
the murderer had concealed himself in the
back vestibule which was dark and he es-
caped without being seen circumstances
pointed strongly to a certain young man
for whom the minister had refused to per-
form a marriage ceremony on the ground
of the applicants ill health this young

man was arrested-

  and discharged for lack of evidence i
take it said hazard gazing out of the
window over the scenes of broadway far
below

  the grand jury did not feel justified ow-
ing to an alibi- the mayor began but

hazard said quietly

  alibis are inconvenient nuisances in the
detection of crime however  think we
need not concern ourselves in that way just
now what was the reputation of the rev-
erend gentleman a subject for scandal
on the contrary the mayor assured
him no breath of such suspicion had ever
been whispered against him a more godly
man never lived

  ah muttered hazard with more show

of interest than he had hitherto betr

and the fourth crime was-

  the mayors lips curled a little bu
ready he was getting into the rapid sv
of this man who sat opposite

  we are going pretty fast he said bi
if you cannot grant me more than a minu
to narrate each of these mysteries i sha
have to be lively indeed the fourth crime
was the cowardly murder of a young girl
without a clew or a motive remaining she
was stabbed to death on the steps of her
own home by a man who sprang out of the
darkness dealt the blow and fled forthwith
the crime seems to have had not the vestige
of purpose

  which of itself opens a wide and amaz-
ing field for speculation answered hazard
getting up in two minutes i must be in
my automobile so i ask you to proceed at
once to the fifth mystery as you call it

  i do not follow you acknowledged the
mayor but the fifth murder was this on
the seventh of july the mother superior
of the good shepherd home for the aged
was missed from the institution and on the
following day her body was found in the
river below town a post-mortem showed
that she died from drowning but at no point
near litchfield is the stream more than
three feet deep it runs through a corner
of the good shepherd grounds and the
mother superior was in the habit of going
down to its banks in a heavy grove for
meditation and prayer here the police
found evidences of a struggle but nothing
was discovered that threw the slightest light
on the crime there is no doubt that
she was seized and held under water until
life was extinct why it may have been
for revenge but for what so far as
known the mother superior had not an ene-
my in the world there are those in litch-
field who incline toward the theory of
suicide on the supposition that the woes of
mankind to which she had been ministering
for forty years had unbalanced her mind
but this theory appears preposterous she
never exhibited any evidence of dementia
unless you call sadness insanity and con-
sider pity a sign of a weakened intellect
it may be that pity is one of the signs
we are looking for said hazard enigma-
tically as he drev on his gloves
the brain jungle



 how so

  the other shrugged his shoulders step-
ping to the wall he took a stiletto from
among the relics that hung there closing
his eyes he made a few passes with it in
front of him so that the mayor stepped
back hurriedly

  i merely stab in the dark observed
hazard tossing the dagger on to his desk
and smiling grimly when  shut my eyes
i sometimes see things that may or may not
exist in reality it is the things one sees
in the darn that makes the good detective
he may stab and hit nothing but if the
thing he sees is really there-ah mysteries
have a habit of fading away

  you have already stabbed at something
in this case demanded the mayor breath-
lessly you have seen something-in the
dark

  a mere deduction hazard put on his
hat and offered his hand to his caller in
adieu a mere grotesque fancy perhaps
-who can say it must be worked out be-
fore it is talked about silence-silence al-
ways is the motto under which we operate
here the imagination my dear sir is a
wonderful thing it can jump to any
height and explore the most inaccessible
mental absurdities but if it is a good
healthy imagination it will return to earth
just as quickly when it finds nothing up
there to seize upon my men will visit you
shortly in litchfield i merely repeat to
you silence good day sir

  a month subsequent to the mayors visit
to the metropolis delos nast one of the
operatives of the hazard detective agency
returned to new york from a visit to litch-
field where other secret agents of hazard
were at work on the night of his return
he and his chief spent six hours in close
communion in the skull room high above
broadway to both these criminal pathol-
ogists the night was pretty much the same
as the day so that dawn frequently came
while they conducted their mental clinics
hazard and nast usually worked on the hy-
pothesis that a study of mental processes af-
forded the best path to crime solution

  on the table between them there now re-
posed the tabulated results of some elab-

orate sales researches conducted in
litchfield and vicinity in other words long
lists of names that were classified ostensibly
into such groups as the clever sales mana-
ger lays out when he analyzes a district pre-
paratory to a selling campaign outwardly
this research had been conducted in behalf
of the electrical outfitting company of
new york and it constituted quite a valu-
able assembly of facts as to the buying
power of litchfield individually and col-
lectively but of course the sales informa-
tion was not destined to be used as a blind
it covered some extraordinarily interesting
facts about a group of persons in litchfield

  nast now gathered up a big bunch of the
papers and tying them with a string laid
them aside

  these he said are the final elimina-
tions the solution of the litchfield mys-
teries does not lie among them if your
theory is correct sir then gathering up
the remaining papers he tapped the upper-
most one with his forefinger somewhere
here he added lies the key

  it is your hypothesis as much as mine
returned hazard speaking from his cus-
tomary halo of blue smoke it was your
work on the wabusson case that suggested
the thought to me

  nast looked across at his chief with af-
fectionate eyes hazard was his god-an
idol before whom he bowed however dis-
similar in some respects the two men were
in accord mentally and however cold and
curt hazard could be with outsiders he did
not fail in sympathetic consideration for his
favorite pupil-this keen young man whose
imagination could take flights almost as high
as his own

  yes nast returned it is my hypothe
sis yet sometimes i confess i question its
reasonableness for the sake of its pic-
turesqueness at least i should like to ac-
cept it unequivocally it would add some
interesting material to forensic medicine

  hazard reached over to a bookcase and
took down a ponderous volume

  and yet he said it would be in tune
with what you already find here in this book
it would simply furnish another example of
the inscrutable workings of the human intel-
lect under abnormal and unhappy condi-
tions it is your privilege and mine nast


short stories

to reach continually a little beyond the
known realms of mental science we are
explorers in that most mysterious of all
countries the brain jungle but we must
not forget that however elusive are the
paths that run through the jungles up in
that land they follow convolutions that
have been mapped thus we draw on what
we already know and by analogy adduce
suppositions

  he opened the volume and let the pages
run loosely through his fingers-pages that
held within their confines many of the
weirdest mysteries of time then he closed
the book sharply

  we are working along the right line
he said every deduction tells me so we
will set the trap soon-and catch in it per-
haps an arch-fiend

  then with a sudden change of tone he
went on

  how many names remain after the elim-
inations

  six said nast

  hazard took the list and studied it long
pondering the closely written notations nast
had made opposite the names he studied
and pondered so long that trinity chimes
rang two oclock and then three before he
put down the list and threw away the re-
mains of his fifth cigar

  our move is to concentrate rather
strongly on abbot abburton he said

   had already reached the same conclu-
sion answered nast

ill

  two evenings later at the dinner hour
delos nast moved cautiously along in the
shadow of an eight-foot brick wall that sur- -
rounded the spacious grounds of the tur-
rets as the home of abbot abburton in
litchfield was called reaching a spot
especially favored by the deep gloom of the
trees he sprang lightly up and caught the
top ledge with his fingers nast was rather
small but abnormally athletic so that in a
few seconds he had swung himself over and
disappeared in the darkness inside

  the abburton home was on a lonely hill
in the outskirts of the most exclusive resi-
dential part of litchfield it was a forbid-
ding old place with flowers and turrets that
had no apparent part in the scheme of life

except architecturally the grounds covere
five acres that were set with trees of dense
foliage many of them sempervirent and
beautiful but long neglected here and
there a huge weeping willow reared its
ghostly form and gave a graveyard aspect
to the place

  abburton himself was as gray and melan-
choly as the great house-a widower living
alone with his servants of the latter he
kept only three all of them as old as him-
self and as unapproachable for thirty
years he had lived thus in growing seclu-
sion and although not wholly a recluse he
spent most of his time at the turrets he
had no intimates and only occasionally did
any one call on him such calls as he had
were usually connected with requests for
contributions to charity and the church of
late a number of persons who solicited
such funds of abburton had met with very
ungracious rebuffs and it was gossiped
that the old mans fortunes had suffered in
some way

  in early life abburton had inherited the
family property married and thrown open
the house to the most brilliant functions
ever seen in litchfield for a few years
the turrets was the social centre of the
city during which period a son was born
but then came disaster of the blackest sort
-the death of wife and child in a runaway
accident after that the house was never
opened to any one except in the most for-
mal way

  some of the ruder children of litchfield
called the lonely man old hawk nose be-
cause of his aquiline features older per-
sons spoke of him sometimes as dante
he might indeed have been a model for
dore had he lived earlier in youth his
sepulchral face had been relieved by the
geniality of his smile and his wit had over-
shadowed his dantean physical atmosphere
but now there was no smile and wit and he
were strangers

  it was here then that delos nast found
himself creeping in the protection of
hedges and shrubbery until he gained a
piazza that extended beneath the drawing-
room windows having explored the prem-
ises on the previous evening he now pro-
ceeded softly to the darkest end where
with a tool of his own invention he deftly
the brain jungle



  ind the window lock through the crevice
  ween the sashes a minute later he was
  ide

  to explore a strange house in the dark
as not an agreeable task but nast was ac-
ustomed to doing it in the interests of jus-
tice in the present case he had no com-
punction for was he not working to dispel
the nameless terror that hung over litch-
field on his hands and knees he crept
across the immense room toward an uncer-
tain light that shone from the corridor
here on reconnoitering he found he had
reasoned correctly in timing his visit ab-
burton was at dinner from the keyhole of
an adjoining room nast saw the sombre old
man sitting alone in state while an infirm
and white-haired man-servant attended him

  this much determined the detective lost
no time in exploring the upper part of the
house and especially abburtons personal
apartments guided by his electric torch he
surveyed the bedroom and dressing-room
off it the appointments of which were with
a few striking exceptions such as a gentle-
man of his refinement and station would
have the chief difference lay in the pres-
ence of a babys bed finished in snow-
white enamel apparently quite new laid
out upon the counterpane were the freshly
laundered garments of a small child
scattered about the rooms were other evi-
dences of strong philoprogenitiveness al-
though decades had passed since the small
son had slept in that crib for the last time

  proceeding to the study farther down
the upper hall nast cast the rays of his
searchlight upon a large mahogany desk
it was locked but he opened it with the
lird key he tried the first thing that met
his eyes was a small gold object which he
scrutinized closely but did not disturb in
one of the recesses of the desk he next un-
earthed some papers the inscriptions upon
which he copied rapidly into his note book

  he had scarcely finished this task when
his alert ears caught the shuffle of footsteps
on the carpeted stairs closing the desk he
concealed himself behind some draperies
and watched abburton switch on the light
open the desk and take from it some of the
papers then turning off the light abbur-
ton left the room

  it was a hazardous situation but nast fol-

lowed risking the danger of discovery the
hall was dimly lighted anyway and he
might pass for a servant should abburton
turn unexpectedly this he did not do but
kept straight ahead except for a jog in the
corridor nast at a judicious distance be-
hind paused a moment at this turn to avoid
getting too close then he followed-but
abburton had disappeared nor could an
hours search of the premises reveal any
trace of him

iv

  a week later felix hazard pondering
some mystery in his skull room was handed
a code telegram which on being translated
read as follows

    i have at last discovered the secret of
  abburtons nightly disappearance within
  his own house last night i gained ac-
  cess to his turret room through a panel
  door and in concealment witnessed ex-
  traordinary things i am sending full de-
  tails by mail important to keep a close
  shadow on abburton day and night send
  three more men at once and have louise
  dennison here by to-morrow afternoon
  indications are that the trap will be ready
  to set by to-morrow night if miss den-
  nison is willing to act your plan is likely
  to work out diabolical things brewing
  anyway

nast

  to this hazard answered by wire in the
agency cipher

    louise dennison is game and will put
  our theory to the test run no chances
  but have her well guarded if it comes
  to a showdown take abburton dead or
  alive

v

  just before dusk the next day a stylishly
dressed young woman rang the gate bell of
the abburton mansion and to the man-
servant who answered presented a card
bearing the name of mrs louise merton
special financial agent of the society for
the extension of religion in america the
footman gravely ushered the caller into the
drawing room requested her to be seated


short stories

and glided out he was quite accustomed
to callers of this class if not to social
guests

  the room bore ample evidence of its erst-
while magnificence with its immense gilded
mirrors its paneled walls rich hangings and
massive mahogany furniture and time had
scarcely dimmed the splendor of its decora-
tions though the air was heavy with the
oppressiveness one finds in rooms long un-
used to sun and air the tragedy of the
abburtons hung over it

  the caller shivered a bit and sat for a
minute watching the door where the man
had disappeared then she arose and
moved silently over to the side of the room
where a massive divan stood against some
draperies seating herself on the divan she
said in a whisper apparently to the tapestry
hangings

   i rely on you nast

  keep up your nerve louise came the
whispered answer the whole game is
now up to you-but have your barker on
tap

  she was back in her chair a moment later
waiting for the expected development
hazard had reasoned it all out-that abbur-
ton on getting her card would come down
to see her she was inclined to be skepti-
cal herself but she knew that her chief had
good analogies from which to reason he
was not working blindly abburton would
come down he had said perhaps it was
well for her state of mind that she did not
know what he was doing upstairs at that
moment however some of hazards spies
were up there watching she knew that

  she waited five or ten minutes and found
herself uneasily watching the darkening
shadows of the room and wondering if the
crystal chandeliers bore any possibilities of
light the day was not entirely gone out-
side as she could see through the chinks in
the time-checked window shades but here
in the drawing room night was already at
hand the silence in the house was deep
and oppressive and she started as a gust of
wind swept under the roof of the piazza
for a moment she arose and her hand went
quickly to the pocket of her coat but she
sank back with a little laugh upon the
cushion of the chair had she not often
braved the uncanniest of dangers in the pur-

suit of her calling then another gust r
tied a window and despite herself a chill
fright swept over her if felix hazari
theory was true-and she well knew that 
never worked on idle guesses-then wer
not the horrors of this house sufficient tc
terrify any woman she revolted at her
profession and felt the impulse to flee from
the house screaming here in the darkness
the thing might happen before even nast
hidden near the divan could avert it

  but it was a womans impulse and she
conquered it the die was cast and she
waited now she could not distinguish the
objects in the room though she could see
the opening into the reception hall how
many doors were there in this drawing
room she wondered straining her eyes
she tried to discover-and suddenly sprang
to her feet for in the last vestige of light
she saw the powerful though gaunt form of
a man before her it was not the servant
she knew it was abburton himself

  he spoke in tones that were singularly
deep and melancholy

  you represent the society for the ex-
tension of religion in america i believe
i do she replied pulling her faculties
together and keeping her right hand in her
coat pocket the society counts on your
benevolence and generosity

  if you choose he said after a mo-
ments pause you may tell me about the
aims of this organization

  the girl shuddered the day before in
the skull room hazard had prophesied al-
most these very words abburton would
utter them he had said and now as she
strove to see the features of the man before
her she recalled the description of him r
given her the beak of an eagle a sinister
mouth with a tortuous curve and eyes that
protruded slightly from their sockets and
had the power to glare with the hate of a
tiger she imagined they were glaring at
her now and that the cruel fingers were
clutching for a spring at her throat with
an effort she fought off her terror ant
spoke calmly

  the society she said stands for one
of the noblest movements ever undertaken
in the name of christianity it is a god-
given work we are doing-a work with
heaven on one side and satan on the other
the brain jungle



  e are fighting satan sir with all the
  ight of goodness

  hazard had written out these words for
ler and she had learned them by rote it
vas quite a speech hazard had composed
for her up there in the skull room and she
had rehearsed it to him until he was satis-
fied she went through it now to the end
incongruously toying with the trigger of her
automatic pistol concealed in her pocket

  we are fighting the devil through the
underlying power of the church she re-
peated at the end as hazard had told her
to do

  he stood in silence for a few moments
when she had finished and she could hear
him breathing as if he had exercised she
imagined that his face worked in contor-
tions though she could not see it sud-
denly he stepped toward her and she
backed away quickly half drawing the pis-
tol whatever his impulse he did not fol-
low it up but turning went to the side of
the room evidently he touched an electric
button for the shade of a man appeared in
the doorway

  a light said the master of the place
then to his caller this room is seldom
used and the fixtures are not in order
the servant reappeared bearing a lamp
with a red shade which he put on the table
abburton stood where his profile was re-
vealed and perhaps accentuated his mouth
seemed distorted momentarily and his great
oval eyes rested on the girl for a full min-
ute before he spoke

  you are staying in the city i take it
  at the grand hotel

  very well if on contemplation i decide
to contribute to the extension of religion in
america i shall mail you a check you
have a cab waiting

  the distance is short i came afoot
then you will find the best path to your
right as you go out of the gate follow the
wall around the corner and proceed straight
ahead you are not afraid of the dark-
iess

  i have no fear sir why should one be
afraid who works in the great cause i
serve

  she backed away from him and passed
into the vestibule and as he opened the
door for her she brushed against him it

seemed to her as if a pair of demoniac eyes
were burning into her back as she went
down the path to the gate and her knees
were weak under her had she really done
the thing so far and escaped

  at the gate she followed his directions
and again at the turning of the wall passing
on into the deeper shadows that lay under
an overhanging willow projecting from the
walled yard

vi

  no sooner was the girl out of the house
than abburton turned and with extraor-
dinary agility for a man of his age ran
lightly down the corridor to the back of the
house thence descending a flight of steps
to a door that led him outside skirting a
row of lilacs that bordered the carriage
drive he made a detour to keep in the deep-
est shadows and reached the wall just back
of the garage this he followed proceed-
ing rapidly despite the darkness until he
reached a small door in the wall pulling
the bolt he opened it and crouched inside
peered out in direction from which the girl
would approach she was coming against
the dim light of a gas lamp far up on the
corner he could see her skirts across the
road was vacant land and clusters of trees
-the night was quite dark

  he breathed now in gasps that were hide-
ous to hear and some metallic thing he held
in his right hand beat a little tattoo on the
bricks against which he huddled she was
very close now

  abburton rose suddenly and stepped
abruptly into the path with his hand up-
lifted when suddenly he uttered a cry and
staggered back blinded by the glare of
some brilliant light that shot out of the
darkness into his eyes a moment later
felix hazard was on abburtons back and
three policemen had him in their clutches
a dagger fell from his loosened fingers and
then a pistol was taken from him by the
chief of police of litchfield together with
all the other contents of his pockets

  curses upon you said abburton as
they shackled him i am the devil work-
ing evil upon everything good how dare
you put bonds upon satan himself re-
lease me or my curse is upon every one of
you


short stories

  an extraordinary case of paranoia
said hazard to the men about him at the
police station a little later the paranoiac
ordinarily conceives himself to be appointed
of heaven to remove objectionable charac-
ters the murderers of our presidents have
been paranoiacs who believed themselves
fulfilling a high and godly duty but here
is a man who acts from the reverse motive
sane in most respects the monomania ob-
sesses him that he is the ruler over hades
and that he must fight the legions of good
this was the theory that forced itself upon
me when first these crimes were brought to
my notice the victims were all arrayed
against the instincts of the devil the first
you recall was the widow-a philanthropist
who had founded an asylum for homeless
children here was typified charity the
second victim was a child-standing for
innocence the candy-poisoning was per-
petrated with the idea of torturing and put-
ting to death more than one little child who
might get the dosed buttercups this
maniac had secured some of these candies
poisoned them and smuggled them back
into the containers on the counter a simple
expedient for the cunning but cruel mind of
a paranoaic then followed the assassina-
tion of the clergyman who was a godly man
you remember representing faith next
came the murder of the young girl who in
the lunatics distorted vision required re-
moval as a type of purity finally the
mother superior represented perhaps pity
for the woes of men and women

  from a cell below came abburtons sol-
emn voice crying

  satans curses upon you

  the logical course hazard went on
was to study the people of litchfield and
by a process of elimination round up the
possible paranoiacs for in paranoia alone
was it reasonable to look for the source of
these deeds we found six possible sub-
jects they were all investigated but from
the start abburton presented the best clews
his family bereavements over which he
was brooding had clearly upset his mind
although to the untrained observer he
showed no symptom of his malady it was
only when my men gained access to his
home that they unearthed positive evidence
and discovered a secret room in one of the

turrets where he had a throne of satai
and went through mystic ceremonies 
which were revealed to him the names o
his prospective victims these names ht
wrote in red ink on a sheet of paper anc
crossed them off in black as he murdered
them when he got louise dennisons card
he took it up to the turret room and there
added her fictitious name to his fateful list
before he went down to see her the chief
of police now has the list taken from the
person of abburton himself

  along with the gold cross of the mother
superior added the chief

  it was a fearful strain to keep watch on
the maniac resumed hazard there was
no telling which would prove his next vic-
tim and to arrest him without conclusive
evidence might give him a chance to escape
indictment and thus remain a frightful
hazard to litchfield paranoia is a most dif-
ficult thing to prove so i resolved to bait
him with this plea from the society for the
extension of religion the widow blauvelt
i discovered had been to see him in behalf
of her orphan asylum on the day she was
killed the reverend dr mathewson like-
wise had sought funds of him for the church
on that very sunday he was shot down in
the dark analogies my friends i try to
reason from such analogies for the human
mind however erratic always comes back
to certain starting points the more you
study the morbid histology of the brain the
more you see that these microscopic tissue
structures in different craniums simply re-
peat the same general story

  in my opinion observed the chief
this girl louise dennison in allowing ht
self to be used as a murder bait ran a ter-
rible risk and deserves the everlasting grati-
tude of litchfield

  the devils curses on the girl came
the wailing voice from below

  louise dennison fears neither man nor
satan said hazard as he lighted another
cigar and as for our friend of the lower
regions his curse so long a deadly menace
to litchfield need no longer trouble you
if only he were the devil in reality

  in which case observed the chief of
police felix hazard would find no further
cause for the exercise of his weird detecting
talents
the price and the pup

  hes a talkin dawg insisted fritz the bartender to

  justify the price he had paid for the pup and the pro-
  prietor had good reason later to believe that he was

the ventriloquic marvel turned
up his collar and hugged the
buildings to escape the full sav-
agery of the autumnal down-
pour he ought to have been
wearing evening clothes on big time
this night a week before and that had
been his lot but he had swapped it in albany
for a skinful of red liquor he had started
his spree a head-liner with full pockets
now he lacked the price of a lodging for
himself and wonder wonder had no coat
collar to turn up and in lieu of anything bet-
ter dropped his tail as he trailed along at his
masters heels but wonder hadnt lost his
faith in the biped ahead in his doggish
estimation the marvel was a glorious crea-
ture who would surely lead him back to the
warm life-lights again a bedraggled god
taking his time in returning to olympus

  the marvel halted outside a saloon in a
mean street and flogged his feverish mind
to attention never before had he been re-
duced so low he had drunk up and wasted
every possible credit and asset except the
wonder his soul cringed as a new sugges-
tion leaped at him sell wonder the pal
of many trials and tribulations the sharer
of successes on big time why one might
as decently think of selling a parent or a
child no sir liquor and exigence could
and did impel their victims to grasp at ab-
normal expedients but thank god the
ventriloquic marvel would never barter the
bone and blood of his only friend and as
he turned and patted the intelligent head
the dog discovered heaven could be en-
sconced in the heart of the chilling storm

  dont you fret old man never that
reassured the marvel

  these words constituting a solemn prom-
ise where everything had been taken for
granted suddenly aroused some nth sense
in the wonder and he whined in a pleading

note and pressed closer against his master
we stick it out together repeated the
marvel firmly

  the shadow of a doubt crept over the
dogs mind as they worked their way deeper
into the cheap neighborhood the same
shadow canopied the mans thoughts as he
desperately cast about for some egress he
would call up the theatre in reaching this
decision he knew it was as hopeless an ex-
pedient as he could indulge in already the
box office had threatened to have him ar-
rested if he trespassed again still if evil
circumstances should force him and wonder
to part company it would be well to remem-
ber he had made a last throw against des-
tiny not that he would sacrifice wonder
-yet one must eat

  they came to another saloon cheaper
and meaner than the others a glance
through the dusty green curtains showed it
was deserted except for a sleepy bartender
at the lower end of the bar confident this
was his last line of defense he extracted a
nickel his last one and briskly entering
approached the telephone and rang up the
empire the evening sale was well under
way and he knew the box office would rage
and tear at the interruption but he owed
it to the dog in fact he felt rather virtuous
in daring the managerial spleen the em-
pire yelped in his left ear and with a shiver
he began bluffing this is the ventriloquic
marvel talking from an uptown hotel just
called-

  he sagged limply against the wall unable
to credit his hearing when the box offices
curt voice cut in saying been looking for
you old man git to syracuse sos to open
to-morrer night the lulu girls act is off
and they want you to fill in got the wire
this afternoon it means long booking if
youve finished your drunk

  righto cried the marvel his heart

short stories

bouncing buoyantly im straight as a
string off the stuff for good and ill give

em the act of the season-

  all right better wire isein at once
good-bye

say just a minute old pal begged the
marvel ill have to touch your office for

a little advance-

  hardly good-night

  listen bo frantically pleaded the mar-
vel his drawn forehead oozing sweat a
ten-spotll git me there and ill give you an

order on the syracuse box-office-

  nothin stirring was the metallic re-
ply the old mans put the kibosh on that
no advance git there if you can if you
cant its your trouble

  jimmy wont you personally let me

have-

  not on your life and bang went the
receiver

  experience had taught wonder to look
for results once his master took on the
mood of radical decision and he pricked
his ears expectantly the marvel his soul
bitter as gall turned and eyed him gloomily
the wonder dragged his belly on the floor
and waited

  the marvel conned the situation fast and
furiously he must make syracuse the
offer was the only life-saving plank afloat
on a sea of misery with ten dollars he
could rehabilitate self ten dollars or hell
given passage to syracuse and he would
prove he could be trusted there would be
the legitimate booking and pleasant park
work throughout the summer in the old days
he would have wired peremptorily for an
advance but the albany lapse the culmina-
tion of a series of backslidings had black-
listed him from circuit to circuit no man-
ager would advance him a penny under any
circumstances so thoroughly had he under-
mined his reputation it caused his thin
face to burn to know he never would have
been offered this one chance had not the
lulu girls defaulted without warning

  the dog watching his masters change of
expression whined softly and dragging him-
self forward brushed his knee with suppli-
cating paw the marvel averted his gaze
ashamed to meet the honest eyes and fur-
tively studied the bartender a glance at
the straight perpendicular formed by the big

neck and the apex of the occipital allowe
the marvel who was an authority on bar
tenders to inventory the man s intellect thi
one possessed cunning sufficient to defeat
requests for credit but would be very credu-
lous as to the impossible and distrustful of
the obvious he would clout a man who
offered a gold dollar for a dime but would
give a weeks pay for a dream-book on
policy

  the bartender laid aside the sporting
page yawned and tentatively sized up the
stranger the marvels raiment albeit
rain-soaked and under a strong light sod-
den still retained its ultra lines then again
the marvels bearing in making notes on the
back of an envelope was impressive the
bartender ambled forward

  beer laconically ordered the marvel
without lifting his frowning gaze from the
envelope

  he continued his memoranda after the
heavy glass was shoved before him had
the drink been the objective the battle was
won for he would have retreated in line
with the window as it was he ignored the
beer and disgustedly exclaimed of all the
rotten luck then meeting the fishy gaze
of the bartender he informed called to
syracuse on business on a night like this
wouldnt that jar you

  thereupon happened the miracle won-
der catching his masters gesture below the
bartenders range of vision rose on his hind
legs and opening his mouth wide advised
drink up old man

  the bartender became cataleptic in-
capable of motion or speech then his
adams apple worked convulsively and he
hoarsely ejaculated gawd he spoke
the marvel raised his brows inquiringly
then smiled indulgently and emptied his
glass oh the pup he laughed yes
hes always butting in

  but he talked choked the bartender
his pudgy hands gripping the edge of the
bar his small eyes fixed in a glazed focus
on wonder

  first one you ever see of them care-
lessly asked the marvel

  first one whispered the bartender
then shaking his head violently to dispel
any hallucinations he weakly asked any
more of em
the price and the pup



     forgot yawned the marvel they
  as plenty over here as across the
  r inside of a year theyll be common
  rords

  he spoke stupidly reiterated the bar-
  nder falling back against the cash re-
  ister

  oh that aint nothing smiled the mar-
vel parrots and crows talk why not
dogs dogs is more intelligent simply
needs the cutting of a certain muscle at the
roots of the tongue do that and theyll
pick it up in no time

  good say can yuh make him do it
agin gasped the bartender

  it aint a case of making gently cor-
rected the marvel glancing anxiously to-
ward the door and fearing some one might
enter before he developed the nub of his
scheme once that talking muscles cut
theyll gab all the time if youd let em
aint that so old boy and again the
hand below the bar gave the signal

  again the wonder rose on his hind legs
and took several mincing steps toward the
dazed bartender and hoarsely requested
set em up again barkeep

  betcha life cried the bartender ner-
vously drawing a foaming glass say if
that dont git yuh goat say id give five
bones if the boss could only blow in say
thats the wonderfullest thing i ever seen
oh it aint nothing deprecated the
marvel lots of em overn england
reckon this is one of the first over here
though hes getting to be a nuisance as
you never know when hes going to spiel
the bartender settled his red elbows on
the bar and stared long and fascinatedly at
the wonder the latter crept to the door
and whined for his master to follow the
marvel felt his soul was naked before the
lition of the dog he turned from the
jar then halted irresolute he was hearing
lie call from syracuse if he did not go
here was the bread line starvation and
freezing the same fate awaited the dog

ffhy from a humane point alone-

  how much does a dick like that cost
ie bartender was asking

  facing about and careful not to overplay
his hand the marvel informed you can
nake a talking dog out of any pup once you
ut that muscle just now theyre fetching

a good price in england but they didnt
oughter be worth moren twenty or twenty-
five dollars veterinary charges five for
cutting the muscle

  will yuh take fifteen beans for that
pup demanded the bartender

  the marvel frowned the wonder howled
softly and scratched at the door i wouldnt
think of selling if i didnt have to beat it to
syracuse muttered the marvel pushing
his hat back from his wet forehead citys
no place to keep a dog in say tell you
what ill do you can have him for fifteen
if youll let me buy him back for seventeen
if i return here inside a week that gives
you two bucks for taking care of him

  the wonder lifted his voice in a long
dolorous howl he had fared high and he
had starved but not till now had sorrow
come to him the marvel felt his courage
slipping he could not endure the dogs
beseeching gaze and he sharply cried
dead dog

  instantly the wonder rolled over on his
side and became motionless the bar-
tender hurriedly counted off the purchase
price from a greasy roll fearing lest the
stranger would change his mind clutching
the money the marvel pulled his hat low
over his eyes and gingerly stepped over the
rigid form once through the door he bowed
against the storm and hastened to the car
line there was a choking sensation in his
throat that no amount of drink could alle-
viate

  true to training the wonder held his
pose although his tail threatened to pound
the floor when his master opened the door
as the bartender grabbed him by the collar
and fastened a cord to it and tied him to the
bar-rail he knew the play was ended and
again his despairing cry filled the long
room

  hi can that noise commanded the bar-
tender surveying his property with arms
akimbo whats yuh name his nerves
were a-tingle as he expected to be ad-
dressed but the wonder rested his head
between his paws and moaned faintly

  before the bauoije could continue his
efforts at a conversation the side door flew
open to admit the proprietor and a friend
both were eager to complete some conver-
sation hindered by the rain and as they re-

paired to the tiny apartment at the head of
the bar the proprietor was insisting

lected to bring the money and hes started a

erating warm your feet caleys sent to

the five the boss would never sent caley
if hed known he was starting a souse

out- what the devils that and he

poked his startled face through the curtains
as the wonder lifted his soul in a final
lamentation

  how come that dog in here fritz he
growled

  my dawg boss proudly explained
fritz then impressively say boss hes
a talkin dawg what dyuh know bout

alderman pulling the curtain aside

and replied all right all right yuh think

the alderman

sionately insisted the bartender he was
rippin it off to beat the band a few minutes
ago hi pup wots yuh name

  the wonder settled his head between his
paws and eyed the bartender sullenly

  take that menagerie away growled
greenshaw you pinhead a talkin
dog

  red of face the bartender unfastened the
cord and dragged the wonder to the back
room and tied him to a table-leg then he
laboriously aimed a kick which missed and
gritted jest wait till im off duty an yuhll
talk or be a dead dawg

  dead dawg recalled to the wonders
sorrowing mind the glare of the footlights
the gaping sea of pallid faces and the storm
of many applauding hands and he rolled on
his back and dutifully simulated death

  wouldnt that git yuh goat wheezed
the bartender backing away his eyes bulg-
ing cant talk eh  ill show them bone
heads jest as soon as he gits used to 
dump talk jest wait till he springt
something on that pig of a alderman

ill

  with fifteen dollars of blood money burr
ing his pocket the marvel gained the ra
road station and discovered he had passe
many bars with never a thought of drinking
it was miraculous had he felt the leas
inclination he knew he would have sue
cumbed but when a man is burying hi
the price and the pup



   t friend after promoting the funeral his
   is appetites of the flesh are apt to take
   acation in truth he was a wild-eyed
   sheveled haggard-faced marvel as he ex-
   mined the time-table and found the next
   train for syracuse left in ten minutes

  what a king he would feel if only old
wonder were at his heels back on the
long circuit he would keep straight and
again star in big time he took his place
in the queue of passengers and advanced to
the window he had owned many dogs in
the history of his act but none so depend-
able and companionable as wonder he
recalled their personalities as the man
ahead leisurely negotiated for a ticket he
forgot humans as his lasting friendships
had been confined to his four-footed com-
panions his weakness had alienated other
friendships only a dog would stand for
the things he had done

   fox terrior and spaniel lordly st ber-
nard and poodle collie and english bull
all true pals lined up before his inner gaze
as the man in front slowly counted his
change disease and accidents had swept
them away all except the wonder prince of
airedales the wonder was the only one
he had ever sold

  god he muttered stepping from the
line and slumping into a settee that was
sure some rough on him hope that guy
dont kick him round and he visualized
the bartenders brutish wrath when the
wonder should refuse to talk it was a
case of him or both of us he defended
ill do the act with a dummy till i can pick
up a likely pup and teach him a few tricks
the clanging of the gong warned him he
had a scant sixty seconds he jumped to
his feet fidgeted then sullenly decided
next train  do just as well no damn
hurry gnawing his knuckles he lounged
to the entrance and stared at the rain-
blurred lights and pondered on how much
he could afford to spend for drinks there
was a convenient bar just across the way
he knew that by this time the bartender
as experimenting with the wonder in his
ears rang frantic cries of pain and the soul-
racking wail of the betrayed and abandoned

  he was wise to what i was u to all
right muttered the marvel no loijer see-
ing the entrance to the cafe eyes just like

a womans dogs eyes are more human than
a humans damn little cuss didnt want
me to go in there he knew something was
up next one i git  be a bonehead if
hed been the collie- but in the col-
lies day he was never so low down as to
sell a pal with an inarticulate cry he
turned up his collar and dashed into the
rain and caught a down-town car

  trade was light in greenshaws that
night through the misty glass he saw the
fat-faced bartender mechanically waiting on
several loungers the dog was not in sight
an awful fear gripped his heart had the
bartender already loosed his rage damn
him hes a murderer choked the mar-
vel then a voice inside his head calmly
corrected no youre the murderer

  he sprang back as though escaping from
an accuser and at that moment a man
lurched against him and careened into the
door moving to the next window which
commanded the head of the bar the marvel
beheld two men in a small curtained apart-
ment they were peering out at the new-
comer he dodged aside that they might
not glimpse him and found himself standing
in the mouth of an alley down this nar-
row way there came a low piteous whining

  he aint dead yet exulted the marvel
and he whistled a shrill peculiar note in-
stantly a joyous clamor answered him he
waited hoping a ragged form would bound
out of the darkness and dash against him

  locked up in the back room choked
the marvel

  racing softly down the alley he came to a
window which was raised a few inches he
shoved it and whistled softly from a table
in the middle of the room came an eager
whining as the table began dancing up
and down he knew the wonder was tied
he hissed a command that brought silence
the room was deserted but beyond the
swing-doors came the sound of drunken
laughter and the clatter of feet vaulting
through the window the marvel rushed to
the table and dived under it and crouched
over the wonder who was now vibrating
madly from nose to tail a second com-
mand was necessary before the animal
would quiet down and permit the marvel to
find and cut the rope

  by this time however retreat was blocked


short stories

by the entrance of men there were three
of them and they took a table near the open
window the marvel humped up over the
dog gave a signal with his finger and the
animal became rigid cautiously peering
from under the soiled tablecloth the marvel
was interested to observe one of the trio
deftly extract a large roll of bank notes
from the pocket of an intoxicated individual
and drop it into a cuspidor

  then the thief said caley tell the boss
the ward ticket  be put through the very
minute the coin comes down the line for the
boys

  ive got the stuff with me now sol-
emnly informed the victim tapping his
raincoat see when it comes to deliver-
ing the rhino the boss always sends for
yours truly see an whaya think he
says to me dont git-touched why
genlmen i can tote a million scads through
this dirty ward an never lose a penny it
makes me laugh me caley the speed-boy
gittin touched i says to the boss forgit
it see

  youre the stuff admiringly cried the
alderman but when i heard you was
lickin em up in cartys place and that
smiling jimmy was in the bunch i told
greenshaw here good-night to caleys roll
if hes got it with him 

  good-night nothing indignantly cried
mr caley think im just in from can-
andaigua huh tell with smiling
jimmy an the whole rotten bunch theres
one guy theyll keep their mitts off drunk
or sober see i got their records i
stand in with the d a im a big chief to

buffalo with a bale of greens an hell wait
for me to blow in an take em off his
hands

  thats straight heartily indorsed
greenshaw jimmy wouldnt dream of
copping anything offn you-as a rule but
hes planning to make a break for the
coast so when men the alderman heard
you was up to cartys with him i got a
hunch he might take a chance an frisk
you

  you did eh growled mr caley sneer-
ing heavily at the saloonke per  wanta
tell you boobs-

  youre hot stuff all right nervously

broke in the alderman but as ive gt
ward meeting mebbe wed better git d
to cases and-

  damnation screamed mr caleyjum
ing from his chair and fumbling in h
clothes its gone stung by-

  what barked greenshaw in an ugly
voice see here caley no monkey-
business

  they got him at cartys huskily cried
the alderman his flaccid face turning a
sickly yellow

  th dirty skins shrieked mr caley
showing his respect for the sullivan law by
tugging a thirty-eight bulldog from his hip
pocket im going back there-

  simmer down thundered greenshaw
rough stuff wont git the money back

  tell with the money choked mr
caley waving the revolver the scuts
dared make a touch offn me ill bump
em off

  but the marvel having an awful fear of
lethal weapons and realizing it was time he
gained the alley now entered the game
even while mr caley was finishing his
homicidal threat the marvel hissed a com-
mand the wonder crawled from under
the table and respectfully sat up on his
haunches and waved his paws at the plot-
ters and their victim

  the grotesque spectacle struck the trio
mute the alderman gaped stupidly
greenshaw puffed his cheeks preliminary
to a profane explosion mr caley stag-
gered against the table and rubbed his eyes
incredulously

  then the wonders jaws opened and in a
deep guttural voice he informed the
moneys in the spittoon at your feet the
tig gink on your left copped it and put it
there

  with a crash the aldermans chair tipped
over backward greenshaw doubled up and
glared in terror at his accuser over the
top of the swing doors peered the dum-
founded visage of the bartender the al-
dermans fall jolted mr caleys nerve-force
into volition he kicked over the cuspido
and pounced down on the money

  as the marvel recalled his pet green-
shaw began to realize the extent of his
worse than failure and with a furious roar
snatched up a chair mr caley promptly
the price and the pup



  an shooting in circles and the alder-
squeaking in terror clawed his way
r a table as the smoke and explosions
d the room with chaos and the crashing
furniture evidenced the mad haste of
e plotters to escape the marvel and the
onder gained the window and were
dirough it

at an early hour next morning the marvel
humbly stood by the baggage-car door and

waited till his friend boisterously leaped
down upon him yelping from sheer joy as
they trudged up the quiet streets the marvel
earnestly assured id rigged it to come
and git you old boy to think you had a
hunch i was double-crossing i just had
to have that mutts fifteen beans but i was
coming back all the time and the wonder
barked wholehearted belief and generously
ignored the red tide of shame suffusing his
masters face

   at the time of the strike of the engineers on the chicago burlington  quincy railroad
a considerable number of years ago the officials of the road dragged in every man they
rrnld find who knew anything at all about an engine to take the places of the strikers

   one man they secured was an engineer at a sawmill all his experience in running an
engine had consisted in pulling the lever and starting the log against the saw and pulling
the reverse lever when the plank was cut off and running the platform back again so the
log could be shoved over to allow the saw to take another slice the yardman gave him
an engine and told him to run  into the roundhouse the sawmill engineer pulled a
lever and the engine slid slowly iito the roundhouse when he was in he saw that some-
thing must be done so he pulled the reverse lever the engine promptly backed out
again

  here shouted the yardman what are you doing you fool why dont you put
hat engine in the roundhouse

   i did have her in yelled the sawmill engineer why in thunder didnt you shut the
door

a tale of old san francisco and of an eastern girls wild night
when through a combination of remarkable circumstances she is
forced to take shelter in the underground passages of chinatown

synopsis of part i

   hope dennison of boston cultured and wealthy arrives in san francisco at night
 bound on a visit to friends in san jose in crossing on the ferry she loses overboard her
 purse containing all her money and railroad tickets three artists who see her mishap
 offer refuge in their studio while they seek to communicate with her friends arrived at
 the studio garcia one of the artists is struck doxvn as he enters the dark room rouge on
 the advice of the third donal frazer flees with the girl and leaves her in a cafe while
 he goes back to aid their comrade meanwhile miss dennison becomes frightened in the
 cafe and is rescued by dot travis a salvation army lassie who takes her to a chinese
 restaurant a tong war breaks out and they take refuge in the tunnels under china-
 town only to become separated in the dark

a pail of water in which many
brushes had been soaking
dashed by donal frazer over de
garcias face brought the
painter out of his faint after
which his friend carried him to the couch
and lighted a lamp

  ha that little devil she have done
what she say many times he groaned
she have at last stick me with the stiletto
a hurried examination proved that de
garcia vas more frightened than hurt
temperament not loss of blood was re-
sponsible for his condition for the weapon
thrust at his breast had glanced from a
block of crayon paper in his inner pocket

making only a flesh wound a scratch which
bled freely smarted briskly and looked ugly
enough

  when rouge came back breathless they
bound up the wound and donal decided
that a surgeon and the attending publicity
was unnecessary it wont do any harm to
wait and see he said probably it will be
all healed over by to-morrow

  ah she have killed me moaned gar-
cia there she wait and spring out on me
from the much darkness a devil with a
knife and she stab me down-so that
is no way to hold a knife the way she hold
him yes i will have to teach her how to
hold the knife as ve do in guadalajara


in the small hours



    ust where is rosaria asked rouge
    ing the artist another glass of wine
    he leave by the fire-escape
    ihe thought you were dead asked
    ge quickly

  most surely i fall estabbed i was
dead for the little time ah that gr-reat
girl she will think she have kill me and
will weep with the sorrow

  you bet she will-and do you know what
she will do shell kill herself

  de garcia jumped from his couch no
no we cannot allow her to the suecide
she the gr-reat model with the delicious
form it is foolishness of her but she is
jealous that  say rosaria you have not the
face like the blonde to paint and she get
mad and try to kill me but she herself she
must not kill come my friends we will
search for the little rose

  where did you leave miss dennison
rouge donal frazer turned to the mu-
sician with the question rouge ran his
fingers through his bright hair at the
nymphia he answered

  frazers eyes became like glinting steel
in his whitening face why in all hell did
you leave her there he demanded

it was near by and the best place i
could think of stuttered rouge i told
her how to act so shell be safe she is
waiting for me at a table in one corner
you have a soul for music rouge and

i	suppose i should not expect you to get past
a dance hall even when youre looking
after a lady donal started for the door
come on we must get her

  but how about rose

  rose bosh snapped frazer she
hasnt nerve enough to kill herself by
this time his quick footsteps were waking
the echoes along the dark stairs the others
followed awed by his anger

  yes agreed de garcia let the little
fool who kill me go let us go on to the
nymphia and get the blonde woman of
van dyke for donal

  rouge was appalled when he found the
table where he had left hope dennison
filled with a group of beery merrymakers
and he kept his eyes averted from dons
white face and glaring eyes the waiter
wno had spoken to her was found and gave
le information that de swell peroxide had

blown wid de salvation army kid called
dot

  but dot was a will-o-the-wisp at sal-
vation army headquarters they learned that
dot had not been in and was not expected
her work kept her out much of the time
a policeman gave them the first clue he
had seen dot and a dame in a sealskin
beat it across portsmouth square in the
hope that she might be resting on one of the
benches they made a circuit of the square
and were turning away dejected when the
fusilade of the highbinders began

  rouge and the groaning de garcia moved
with interest toward the firing but donal
frazer stood chin on breast staring at the
grass beneath his feet he must find her
find her quickly this girl with the greek
face and the shy sweet eyes his heart
thudded his breath came hurriedly with
fear-fear for the girl whom he had seen
for the first time less than three short hours
ago

  de garcia and rouge had returned to
him and were standing before the steven-
son monument in the centre of the square

  it is the bum ar-rt cried de garcia
looking at the monument with its bronze
ship of old spain riding the crested waves
it is rotten it is a cr-rime never do
they put up the sculpture which is gr-reat
such bum ar-rt it makes me seeck

  dont get excited or you will open your
wound said rouge soothingly

  come frazers voice was harsh and
quick for a moment he loathed his com-
panions who could never be really moved
save by their art come we are going to
the police miss dennison must be found
he led the way across kearney street to-
ward the hall of justice

  de garcia forgot his artistic and physical
injuries for the moment surely he said
she is real she is what you say the true
goods we will go to the police we will
find her he waved his stick encourag-
ingly

  she is probably with this dot the girl
will be kind to her said rouge desiring to
excuse himself for desertion of his charge

  how do you know what this dot is
flared donal only to be stopped by a cry

  a girl with black hair escaping from its
pins and falling about her face was run-


short stories

ning toward them calling rouge o
rouge

  it is one friend of yours rouge she
cry you by the name

  never saw her before rouge mut-
tered

  you are rouge arent you she gasped
as she came up to them

  frazer answered yes this is rouge
are you dot where is miss dennison
where did you leave her is she safe

  no introductions necessary boys you
guessed me at the barrier mine was easy
seeing your clothes-rack friend here is a
signboard for him who runs to read but
how you guessed dot first crack i dont
know

  never mind answered frazer where
is miss dennison

  thats why i chased you a whole block
shes somewhere under chinatown i lost
her

  great heavens under chinatown-
kept a prisoner impossible

  shes down one of the tunnels unless
shes found her way out we had to skidoo
down the secret way  she went on tell-
ing them of the eveningls adventures from
the time when she as she said butted in
on a shoestring

  even de garcia was now impressed with
the seriousness of the position of this bos-
ton girl who might be in the worst possible
danger

  quick we must get the police said
donal in a shaking voice

  but dot vetoed the idea promptly the
bulls dont know a b c about this under-
ground game besides she wouldnt want
her pic on the front page of the yellows
my old kee chow can find her quicker than
the whole blooming force

  but what are we to do inquired the
thoroughly frightened rouge

  do repeated dot follow her of
course come with me to kee chows and
well see if we cant hire a guide want to
see chinatown she drawled in imitation
of the guides of the quarter

  there was a policeman barring admission
at the door of kee chows restaurant but
frazer knew him and they were allowed to
pass in and up the stairs only one chinese
was in sight in the outer room and he was

evidently in a condition of extreme ner
ness he recognized dot but to
wheres kee chow would only m
me no sabbee me no sabbee

  shes down in the basement undei
somewhere said dot unless she a
into some other part of the secret way

anyhow-

  anyhow from here she started said
donal firmly if there is a way from here
into that tunnel let us find it

  so dot led them into the back room
where she and hope had been frazer and
rouge pulled back the tapestry where kee
chow had disclosed the door there was
nothing seemingly save solid wall donal
searched for a secret spring working with
his nails and pocket knife over the entire
wall while dot poured cold tea for herself
and de garcia out of the pot which still
stood where she had left it when the alarm
came

  their search was useless try as they
would they could discover no entrance to
the secret way

ii

  donal frazers face was set determinedly
we must follow her he said quietly if
we have to tear this building down

  id go for the police suggested roue
they can raise such a hubbub that the
chinks will be glad to hunt her up and see
that she is safe

  the police are hopeless when it comes
to dealing with the chinese underground
replied donal grimly

  dot sniffed go for your grand-
mothers she said scornfully and tell
em to bring their specs cause there aint
much light to see by say are you boys
game

  for what demanded donal

  i know a girl who married a chink
she was one of the girls on the coast ive
never called nor left my card since she went
to housekeeping in the chop-suey line but
i guess shed come through if i gave her the
proper noise paints-and-oils here has a
slice out of him and blood on his shirt if
youll stick for the game ill go deal her a
hand

  you mean

  oh weve been in a scrap and somebod
in the small hours



      tuck taken in his bright hopes of a
     life and its up to us to skidoo see
     ouge and de garcia shook their heads

  you may think you look innocent re-

  rted the girl but crime is written all
over your phiz if paints-and-oils hasnt
killed some one in the last hour it isnt due
to his looks anybody that takes two
squints at me will swallow any story of
midnight murder i care to hand out i
havent butted in on any such doings so
far in my young existence and the bulls
havent any dark glances for yours truly
but miss dennison is all to the good and
im willing to be anything in the way of
crime and having to get away just to find
her

  i suppose this friend of yours can get us
into the secret way and we will have some
chance of finding or following miss denni-
son said frazer

  youre right replied dot come on

  they hastened along the street till they
came to a dark alleyway lit only by a single
big lantern this lantern was half way
down the block and its illumination fell on a
heavily barred door covered with chinese
placards here dot rapped lightly but hur-
riedly a face appeared in a little grating
almost hidden by a swinging shutter to
the face dot addressed herself with such ef-
fect that the door was opened and the four
of them found themselves in a dark and
dirty hallway their silent guide took them
past heavy curtains through a steadily
thickening atmosphere of drugged smoke
at the end of the passage their guide
stopped me fetchee he muttered

  now you boys back me up whispered
dot travis groan you indian she
hissed at de garcia

  garcia groaned from sheer nervousness

  a figure appeared in the doorway - a
white woman though so painted withered
and boney she might have been a piece of
antique carving dot called out softly
say tillie its dot and ive got to skidoo
with these boys trouble tillie all sorts
of it

  the woman stared at them with glazed
eyes and frazer saw that she had been
smoking opium anybody see you come
here she demanded motioning them in
and closing the door

  no one replied donal

  cut out the spiel tillie cried dot
weve got to make a get-away and we
arent going to leave here either say you
arent going to turn us down are you

  the woman seemed puzzled her roving
eyes caught the stain on de garcias shirt
and the end of the bandage beneath his
chin instantly she became eagerly alive
so thats your game now is it she
snarled at dot i always thought you were
the little sissy just from sunday school
hah she laughed mirthlessly

  it wont do you much good if they get us
in your place said dot quickly

  the woman blanched without another
word she opened a door behind her and mo-
tioned them through frazer was the last
to enter the door closed after him there
was the snap of a heavy lock they were in
utter darkness

  this is the devil ejaculated de garcia
where is it that we are

  dots voice almost broke as she replied
god knows this is the worst joint in
chinatown and tillies husband is the boss
of it boys i-guess my little scheme didnt
work the way it panned first off frazer
was sure he heard her catch and strain
back a sob

  first thing let us find out what kind of
a place this is he said striking a match
by the feeble light his eye caught a bit of
candle on the end of a table lighting this
he led the search about the room there
was no door except the one by which they
had entered

  it has the smell most awful groaned
de garcia tapping excitedly on ceiling
walls and floor with his stick

  thats hollow shouted rouge and
plunged down on the floor to struggle with
the iron ring of a trap door

  once in the cellar they were still at a
loss but dot now that she was sure that
the woman tillie had accepted their story
and tried to conceal them insisted that they
must go farther down we went a whole
story below kee chows basement she
told them

  their search for an exit seemed vain un-
til rouge tried to move a barrel lying with
its head out on its side against the wall
the barrel was immovable rouge stooped


short stories

down and crawling into the barrel van-
ished his voice drifted back come on
you people

  a foot or so away from the barrels
mouth frazer found candles and matches
carefully laid upon a brick and they began
picking their way down the winding pas-
sage dot travis would not hear of a divi-
sion of forces well see this thing
through together she insisted

  it is we will die together said de
garcia groaning over his wound

  they proceeded a hundred yards arriving
at a cross tunnel where frazers quick eye
caught the glint of something in the earth
of the floor he picked it up thats one
of her hair pins said dot looking over
his shoulder

  but which way was she going

  dot peered down the tunnel stooping to
see its length when she arose her finger
was on her lip sh-h she whispered
theres someone up there

  without a word frazer knelt down shad-
ing the candle that its light might not shine
into the tunnel but his scrutiny was fruit-
less he started to rise and lifted the can-
dle it went out with a hiss a violent
report filled the tunnel with a crash of noise

  the four turned and fled stumbling
along in the darkness de garcias foot be-
came entangled in a fold of the girls cloak
and they fell without effort to save them-
selves down a flight of steps donal and
rouge close behind de garcia and the girl
only saved themselves by extending hands
to either wall carefully step by step
frazer went down only four steps he
said they cannot be badly hurt

  de garcias voice came from the floor
if i arrive out of this place i will kill some
one he stuttered

  if i arrive out ill quit slumming in
chinatown and stick to the coast said dot
ruefully ive lost my bat torn my skirt
skinned my knee lost my temper and
spoiled my nose

  frazer relit a candle and surveyed the two
on the planks as they picked themselves up
and went on more circumspectly we must
get on quickly he said our highbinder
friend may take it into his head to follow
when they had traversed seemingly end-
less miles of tunnel which now and then

twisted around some rocky obstacle
crept over or dipped below yet anc
rouge stopped them we must be ui
the bay i smell clams

  at that instant a distant rumbling grt
suddenly and sharply louder the tunne
seemed to quake and give with a com-
mon impulse they dashed on and stumbled
up a short flight of stone steps to find them-
selves on meiggs wharf just as a belt line
engine trundled a string of heavily laden flat
cars along the street behind them

  oh will we ever find our wandering
child gasped dot hysterically

ill

  the fog was thick and gray the breeze
from the ocean chill spent with the effort
of her flight hope had no energy for fur-
ther exertion and sank down upon a heap
of shingles in the lee of a lumber pile
here she was protected somewhat from the
cold wind and could rest a while

  out at the end of the wharf a fog bell
pealed mournfully and solemnly its warning
to the moving vessels on the bay farther
down the waterfront a siren signal horn
emitted doleful cries at regular intervals
now and then a little engine puffed through
the fog trailing long lines of freight cars
back and forth she could see its headlight
through the shifting mist and it comforted
her

  but she was too exhausted to care about
her loneliness she wanted rest and
warmth and most of all sleep her eyes
would close despite the cold and dampness
which penetrated her clothing like rain
her mind refused to grasp the horrors she
had been through strangely enough all
she could remember distinctly was the con-
soling voice of donal frazer she went to
sleep there on the wharf where the lum-
ber boats from the northern pineries had
unloaded their fragrant cargoes

  the cold awoke her very soon a cold that
cut through to the bone and caused her ab-
solute pain the wind had shifted to the
west and was blowing with a keener chill
her bulwark was useless now she must
move on get to some place where there
was a fire else she felt she would die of
exposure she must search for those who
had tried to be kind to her or for others who
in the small hours



 be kind the few moments of repose
leared her brain and replaced a bit of
lost energy she who had never slept
omfortably in her life now stretched her

amped limbs and beat the blood into her
iff hands she crept from the lumber pile
and stamped up and down the dock swing-
ing her arms across her breast like a farm-
hand on a winters morning

  there was still no sign of dawn in the
east though the fog was too thick to de-
termine she thought it must be near
morning the crowding events of the night
seemed to have filled countless hours she
set out down the long line of wharves to-
ward the light in the sky that betokened the
city

  it was the sobbing of a woman that
stopped her at first she thought it a dis-
tant sound from off the bay she paused
and waited for it again and when it came
in unstifled sighs and moans she almost
fled

  i cannot do it i cannot do it the
cries were some place in the fog and very
close let me die i cannot kill myself

  hello called hope her voice was
faint and trembling the sobs did not
cease she was strongly inclined to run
away to leave behind this added terror of
the night if she had remained with donal
frazer if she had stayed where rouge had
put her in the dance hall if she had kept
firm hold of dots hand she would not now
be alone half dead and hearing those heart-
wrenching sobs it was a woman in trouble
she could not desert her the anguish in
those moans came from a pain greater than
any discomfort of her own her misfor-
tunes shrank to their rightful size before
this sound of misery and she gained cour-
age from this greater pain a misfortune
that she might help shook off her growing
lethargy

  slowly through the thick fog hope made
her way out the long pier following the
sound of the weeping and came to a little
bundle of clothes and hair sprawled on the
wet planking she knelt down laying a soft
hand on the shuddering shoulder the
mass of hair was flung back and a face
looked into hers a sea lantern on a tall
pile bravely coping with the murk gave a
diffused feeble light indistinctly hope

could see that the face was young and beau-
tiful that there were large dark eyes
rimmed by thick lashes that the quivering
lips were red and full though wet and
bedraggled the figure was lithe and straight
this was a woman worth saving if beauty
was of value to the world

  what is the matter asked hope of the
eyes that were staring into her face with
the amazement of one who sees a ghost

 gracious mary ah madonna you
have been good to come at my prayers
help me to die be kind to me that has
loved give me the courage to die

  hope shook the shoulder in a very human
way i am not the madonna she said
sharply i am a girl like yourself and i
will not help you to die i will help you to
live what were you going to do

  drown myself hope shivered but
i did not dare it was so cold and so black
the water i must die i must die and
the little figure fell back on the plank face
to the boards and sobbed

  this will never do come get up we
will go away from here hope shook the
girl with an energy that finally brought her
to her feet

  i must die she kept sobbing

  then do it some other way there are
many ways more comforting than cold
water take poison a helpless impa-
tience possessed hope

  it burns and stings so no i have
thought many times and long about the
way i would stab myself but the blood-

oh- the girl shivered

  there is gas suggested hope drawing
the girl with her away from the water and
toward the shore end of the pier some
people prefer gas i have been told that it
is very soothing

  we use coal oil at our house said the
girl beginning to walk of her own volition

  a wild desire to break into shrieks of
laughter surged over hope while she
wracked her brain to think of some other
way that women take to end the journey of
life if she could keep this girls mind from
its purpose until she could lead her away
from the water she was sure she could dis-
suade her from jumping into the bay with
a substitute method of suicide she felt she
would be able to cope


short stories

  in paris in the studios she said they
kill themselves with the fumes of charcoal
it is the pleasantest way you just get ready
in a nice pose and go to sleep and when it
is all over you are beautiful to look at
wouldnt it be lovely to die that way
hope had taught a class in sunday school
and her tone was of the sweet and mellow
softness that used to calm the childrens
restlessness

  studios of paris cried the girl wrench-
ing her arm from hopes grasp oh i
must die i must-i must she ran
swiftly back over the way they had come
hope utterly dismayed chased wildly after
her it was a race for the water but the
girl who sought its healing power for her
pain was no match for hope in a burst of
speed half way out the pier hope caught
her and throwing her arms about her bore
her to the planks for a little time they lay
there panting and sobbing together then
with ill be good ill go with you the
girl arose and hope led her away from the
wharves

  now said hope when she had recov-
ered her breath i will take you home tell
me where you live

  it is no use i tell you i have to die
do you understand there is no other way
i cannot go home if it isnt the water then
something else perhaps the charcoal would
be the best

  tell me about it i may be able to help
said hope gently they sat on the edge of
a sidewalk hope questioning but the girl
whose sobbing had become a choking moan
held her hands against her breast and
answered nothing trying to alleviate the
pain hope mentioned all the reasons for
life and told of her own desire to brighten
in any way that sympathy or money could
this darkness in the girls life still the lit-
tle figure of despair ceased not to moan
suddenly she stood up perhaps-just
perhaps i may not need to kill myself you
have been good-oh so very good to me

i	must find him-find donal and she sped
away into the fog

  hope followed but was soon stumbling
among railroad tracks and lost to all sense
of direction she will find donal she re-
peated in a dazed whisper she will find
donal oh why does not donal find me

iv

  at last wearily hope wandered in
street of warehouses dead gray buiidi
with shuttered windows and steel doors ti
sidewalk soon became a stairway up whic
she climbed past poor homes where dogs
barked at her and cats abandoned their noc-
turnal rendezvous to glide into the mist
the fog enwrapped her in dreary loneliness

  suddenly above her and far away to the
right she heard the voice of a man singing
the air was one from ii trovatore she
held her breath to listen as the invisible
singer came nearer soon she could hear
the words sung in italian in a strong
sweet tenor the man was braving the
morning winds with the power of his lungs
singing lustily into the fog and he could
sing

  hope whose opera season was a round
of box parties knew music well was able
to appreciate this superlative effort of the
night when the last note died away she
began the ascent of another flight of steps
halfway up the singing started again this
time close above her on the steps again
the strong sensation of being in a dream
possessed her now the toreadors solo
from carmen was hurled out with sweet-
ness and with fury it was good to hear
such music after her night of terrors when
it ceased the singer still invisible in the fog
she leaned forward as she would have done
in her opera box and applauded

  hulloa whos there who calls the
question came in the sweet tones of the
singer

  it is a stranger-a lady who is lost re-
plied hope in italian will you help me

  wait till i come was the response

  there was a clattering of metal and out
of the darkness and mist came a man who
carried at either end of a yoke across his
shoulders a great tin can in his hand was
a quart measure he was short of stature
thick-set black bearded drops of moisture
dripped from his slouch felt hat and his high
rubber boots were shiny with dampness
but you are american he cried as he ap-
proached near enough to see hope what
are you doing up here this hour of the morn-
ing

  i have lost my way and my friends i
in the small hours



     	cold and tired it has been a night
  ffering for me and i simply must find
  ce to warm myself and rest i have no
  ney but i can get money to-morrow i

  	reward you well if you will help me
ow

  she was pleading with him unconscious-
ly leaning forward with hands clasped and
eyes upraised to his face

  you sing he said abruptly stating a
fact more than a question

  yes not as you sing but a little

  her voice told him more than the words
ah you can sing do you know the duet
addio senza rancor from the la bo-
heme and he hummed its opening notes
she knew and she sang standing there on
a landing in the stairway sidewalk up mont-
gomery street at four oclock of a spring
morning in san francisco hope dennison
as in a dream sang mimi to a milkmans
rudolfo sang as she had never sung in
any drawing room before her was the
broad squat italian but she saw only the
steady gray eyes of donal frazer and sang
to them she forgot her miseries as their
voices mingled and drifted with the fog and
her deep breaths sent the blood warmly
through her veins

  when they had finished the milkman
who had set his cans down by the fence
took off his dripping hat and made her a
low bow you are grand signorina and i
am your slave come i will take you
where you may have fire and rest and it is
near here it is at the house of a hundred
steps no do not faint at the name you
are already most of the way to the top we
will go there at once and some day perhaps
you will let me hear you sing again he
picked up the yoke and led her back to
where a flight of steps ran up from the
street into the fog they were broad steps
of stoncn cut out of the solid rock of the
hill will you take my arm requested
the milkman

  thank you signor i have traveled a
thousand miles and a thousand steps or it
seems so to me will there be a woman at
the house at the end

  woman ah no i could not take you
to the women of my country in the quarter
the women i know they would not under-
stand you are in trouble and i take you

to a good man he is not a priest but he
is like him to be admired for his goodness
there is not a dog be it ever so flea-bitten
that is turned away hungry from that house
our children love him though he is not of
our language or our religion he is kind
and brave and true you may trust him as
you would your own mother it is but a
few steps farther and you are at his door

  it was but a few steps but they were
hard steps for hopes wearied feet the
milkman supported her almost carrying her
to the landing before the door she leaned
against the railing while he rapped a long
and hard tattoo on the panels

  they were above the thinning fog the
bay lay below them so near it seemed a
stone might be tossed into it from where they
stood and the lights of the ships at anchor
could be seen as shaded glows from this
height hope beheld the silhouette of the
buildings in the centre of the city the sky-
scrapers that she looked down upon it
was all below her the horrors of the night
the dance hall chinatown and the wharves

  the italian was pounding on the door
with his measure but the house remained
quiet there was a light turned low show-
ing dimly through the curtained windows
misere he is away cried the milkman
and hopes heart sank

  it was cheering to hear his never mind
we can get in for his door is never locked
see here is the latch string out for us
or for any one who is weary he thrust
the door open and went within hope fol-
lowing

  in a large room a lamp was burning low
on a centre table the milkman turned up
the wick and hope looked about her a
huge stone fireplace where a log was
smouldering was her first impression-the
prospect of heat the brightening light
showed her that she was in the workroom of
a student the walls where great beams
framed the oiled redwood were lined with
rows of books while on the tables more
books were heaped there was a desk with
a typewriter and sheaves of paper blank
and manuscript lying loose a telephone on
a stand in the corner rude but comfortable
mens chairs here and there a piano at one
side and a long low cushioned seat before
the two wide windows overlooking the bay


short stories

  the milkman was replenishing the fire
while hope surveyed her surroundings he
evidently had no difficulty in finding his
way about for he came from the rear of
the house with an armful of wood and kind-
ling and blew the coals into a lively flame
take off the wraps and this will soon dry
you off he said warming his hands for
me  have to continue the round to supply
the milk otherwise many of my people
will oblige to drink their breakfast coffee
black which is not good this house is
yours signorina i speak for the owner
he continued with a smile for he would
say the same but better said you may
pull the latch cord within and be sure of
privacy good morning i go bowing
low the gallant milkman backed through the
door

  alone a roof above her a fire before her
hope proceeded to make herself comfor-
able in a side room she found a mans
lounging robe which she borrowed and
soon had her wet coat and over-skirt steam-
ing before the hearth it was a cozy home
she thought sleepily as she rolled the big-
gest padded chair where the warmth of the
fire would reach it then she turned the
lamp out and as she did so looked from
the window the east was red with the
dawn the fog was gone save for thin
shreds shifting close on the bosom of the
bay which now was beginning to dimple
with the pink of the skys reflection she
could see the moving figures of men mak-
ing sail on an anchored bark beyond were
the hills blue hills with their summits crest-
ed with radiance her night was gone
she sank into the chair her eyes closed and
she slept

v

  i have been the long hours without a
single damn drink de garcia sank down
on a stack of fish nets on meiggs wharf with
this mournful and sincere diatribe against
fate his companions found places where
they too might rest and the manner in
which they lurched into comfortable posi-
tions told of the exertions they had put
forth to find hope dennison dot travis
used to her all night rounds in saving those
who could be saved from the barbary coast
was the freshest of the four but she too

was glad to rest after the second jourt
the night under chinatown

  ah this love of humanity which
my soul will some day be the death
me continued the painter who hated t
silence of concentrated thought here a
i wounded and smarty hunting through
these holes in the underneath for a van
dyke woman it is a cr-ime van dyke
he never could paint with his cold flemish
blood he was not whistler nor the great
velasquez they are ar-rt they have
the insides

  oh shut up garcia rouge interrupted
please let him go on and tell me cried
dot hes grand its like the spieler at
the sultans harem only more so

  so it is love of humanity that is driving
you to these exertions garcia asked
rouge

  it is my gr-reat hear-rt that beats for
every one yes even for that little devil
who stab me wrong with the knife and cause
me to sting in the chest and you rouge
why do you weary the legs over this girl
which you do not know

  conscience i left her alone and in
such a place it is all my fault and rouge
dropped his head in his hands

  buck up red said dot im the vil-
lian with the cigarette in the meller-
drammer i took the lady from you and
put her into the cru-el cruel world
suddenly her slang dropped from her
there was a little girl back of that perfectly
beautiful face of hers it made me remem-
ber-and i had almost forgotten that good-
ness existed in this world dots voice
wavered

  still donal frazer sat staring straight be-
fore him into the fog

  ah yes said de garcia she was the
cold beauty of the north i paint the palms
of the southlands where the su kisses

those trees velas-

  shut up roared donal jumping to his
feet do you want to drive me mad all of
you with your maunderings here i am
trying to plan out some way to get track of
her-pray god she is safe come on or
get to your beds i am going to find hope
dennison

  they sprang to their feet in astonishment
for donal frazer was not prone to violence
in the small hours



  was swinging off toward the city and
y ran to catch up with him we will
k by you don wait called rouge
where is it to be now asked de
garcia

  the police we will have those tunnels
and underground opium dens searched if
she is in chinatown we will find her i am
going to the police and tell the chief the
story we cannot stop to worry over the
publicity now

  well stop at kee chows and see if hes
returned hes better than the chinatown
squad of police if we can get hold of him
and hell do more for me than the chief
will do for you said dot earnestly

  the north beach morning cars had not
begun to run so they hurried along the
wharves thus saving themselves the climb
over the hill in silence they skirted the
bluffs of the hills and turned into the em-
barcadero listen said rouge as he sud-
denly paused

  high above them beautiful as the voice
of angels rose the sad and pleading strains
of boheme softened by the distance
and fog yet clear in quality of tone it rose
and mounted higher male and female voice
in perfect blending to the final chord
rouge removed his hat and stood his eyes
raised in adoration when the last note
died dot broke into tears almost hysterical
in their bitterness she is with them-the
angels are singing she sobbed

  angels damn it is riandardo-the
man spluttered de garcia the woman
ah she i do not know but she can sing
she have the hear-rt and the blood which
pound through the veins she is the ar-
tiste

  but singing here-at such a time
questioned rouge

  he is the man of milk as he go his beat
when he is where that people do not mind
that they awaken to beautiful music-my
people the gr-reat latins who love beauty
-then he sing but she who sing mimi so
rich and true her i do not know

  was there-did you-was there not

something in her voice- frazer was

talking confusedly and gazing upward to-
ward the crest of the hill i thought it
sounded like her

  like miss dennison there was blank

astonishment in rouges tones you have
never heard her sing don

  no-of course not-but as i imagine
her voice would be if she sang i am crazy
i guess

  you are tired out donal

  she that van dyke woman sing like
that oh no my don nevair nevair
it is the women of the south who sing like
the mimi the carmen the lucia but don
was hurrying on again and did not listen

  at kee chows tea house the chinese at-
tendant nodded mysteriously to dot and she
followed him to a corner away from the
others when she returned her face wore a
smile the first since she had heard the duet
from boheme

  theres news from the front she cried
and while it isnt the whole bolt of silk
its buttons and trimmings miss dennison
is not in chinatown down stairs or up kee
has sent me word that she went through got
out he hasnt got her card with her pres-
ent address but anyhow she is away from
his yellow friends aint that grand hes
still on her trail

  are you sure you can believe him
asked frazer

  believe him hes a whiter yellow man
than any white man im confidential with
he wouldnt lie to me to save his pigtail
dont worry about the veracity of this item
rejoice shes safe

her conviction and enthusiasm were con-
tagious what is next to be done asked
rouge as they went down the stairs i am
as hungry as a deer hound i vote we eat
and drink added de garcia

  at nine im to come back for further
reports kee is to get word to me then i
suppose we might as well spend some of the
interval playing with a knife and fork said
dot

  even donal frazer was imbued with dot
travis faith and confidence in kee chows
ability to find hope dennison he turned
to her and a smile relaxed the strained lines
of his face then miss dot i invite you
to breakfast with us at the house of the
hundred steps he said

vi

  i must find donal

  the thought was an inspiration to ros-


short stories

aria if there was any path that she might
take leading away from death donal frazer
would know and guide her was he not the
refuge of all troubled bohemia had he
not saved pazzoni when the sheriff put
locks on the door of his studio and read
legal papers at him that would not let him
get his canvases his brushes or colors
had he not taken little jimmy clinch out of
prison when he pulled down the coggswell
monument because it was bad art if any-
one could make smooth her rough way
donal-was he so she broke away from this
girl who talked a different language than
the studios and ran to frazers home

  he was not there of course he would
be with de garcia beside his dead friends
body she made a frightened journey
through black alleys back to the studio
prying with startled eyes around each cor-
ner before venturing she approached the
building from the rear and looked up at its
window the window where de garcia had
entered to meet her knife it was dark and
her worst fears were confirmed they had
taken him to the morgue if she had only
wounded not killed there would be a light
by which the watchers sat she sat down
in the mire of the alley heedless of dis-
covery and wept

  tragically she reviewed the details of
her fury he had neglected her to paint
the foolish girl from the institute who
rhapsodized equally over his eyes his rings
and his pictures and finally he crowned
insult with injury his canvas of dancing
bacchantes now on the easel did not hold
her own fair slim figure

  to cease painting her ah that was to
kill she had come to his studio this night
finding on the easel the new picture
sketched in she recognized most of the
figures-girls who compared with her were
as the duck to the swan the cow to the deer
and she had been seized by all the furies
she had always been in all his paintings
frequently the reason for them to be told
that she was not needed when there were
bacchantes to be done on a huge canvas
in oils had driven her over the edge of
despair

  but now this insult was forgotten she
could think of her painter-lover only as he
had been through the years she had known

him-kind generous and proud of
beauty the feel of his arms about her
the only thing on earth that she desi
now and she wept bitter tears that she ha
done this thing

  day came as she sat beneath the window
a patrolman passing saw her there in the
alley and pulled her to her feet with no
gentle hand get along home now he
said gruffly she fled in affright i must
find donal she repeated to herself as she
crept through deserted streets toward his
house she dared not take a car the
police would be hunting for her and she
must see donal find him before they
caught her-dragged her to prison

  kee chow highbinder and tea-house pro-
prietor trailed as the indian trails by
those imperceptible signs that are left in
the passing of the pursued he found the
place in the tunnels where hope had fallen
exhausted from there step by step with
many retracings he followed the passages
she had taken to the outlet on the wharves
near the chinese detention shed by a
passing fisherman coolie he sent word back
to dot and continued on the trail

  it was enough for kee chow that littee
missee had begged him to find her friend
that absence from his restaurant after mur-
der had been done placed him under sus-
picion by the police was of secondary im-
portance littee missee had cried real tears
from eyes he had never seen dimmed he
would risk the rope to bring back her smiles

  hope dennison never knew how many
infinitesimal fractions of her outer self she
left behind her that night but kee chow
found bits of fur from her jacket on the
bundle of shingles where she had rested
threads from her gown on the wharf where
she had struggled with rosaria on the
stairs where she had begun the climb up
telegraph hill was the impress of little
muddy feet then a glove where she had
sung the duet on the stone steps the
marks of her damp and dragging skirts were
plain to the chinamans keen eye

  riandardo finished his deliveries of milk
in silence he could sing no more this
morning after that inspired duet but he
thought much and wondered more about the
mimi whose voice had been true if his
figure had not grown so broad with the
in the small hours



years if his voice had not harshened with
the fogs of the sea-ah would it not be
glorious to take her to sing with him as he
used to sing when he was a bright star in
the operatic firmament of the central and
southern americas it could never be for
he was become squat and husky voiced he
might see her again and maybe she would
sing for him or with him it would be his
excuse that he would tell the kindly owner
of the house of the hundred steps that he
had taken the liberty of giving his home to
the signorina yes he would go back when
the sun was higher and she had finished
her sleep and beg her to sing

  snuggled together in a corner of the al-
most empty street car the tired artists and
the salvation army girl dozed while donal
frazer kept watch as his street neared he
shook them awake and they left the car
rouge and de garcia ahead they had
taken only a few steps when they were
stopped by a startled cry

  garcia garcia my garcy can it be
thou and alive

  little rose surely it is i your own
garcia come to these arms which ache
that they may hold thee

  rouge and frazer turned their backs
upon this meeting of the latin lovers but
dot filled with curiosity peeped

  rosaria convinced that this was her
garcia in the flesh flew to him with out-
stretched arms thank the saints that they
have preserved thee to me she sobbed
ouch cried the painter as she flung her-
self on his bandaged breast it is the pain
-the pain of the stab my little one no
do not draw away-i love this suffering
which you give me all night have i search
to tell of the forgiveness surely yes i for-
give

  and you will paint me in the picture
o gai ia why did you leave me out of the
picture which is seven feet long

  those bacchantes o little rose do
you not know that they must be of a fatness
and coarse ah you are the delicate the
refined you are not fitted for these coarse
pictures

  after the embrace that accompanied this
diplomatic explanation don and ivouge
broke up the treaty of peace by greeting i-he
prodigal then together de garcias aim

around the waist of his spanish sweetheart
they all climbed the steps to frazers house
they arrived at the door and were about to
enter when there came a call from a clump
of eucalypti near by and a queer figure in
flowing shirt and baggy trousers came run-
ning toward them i flound him lady
cried kee chow o littee missee i flound
him lady

  donal frazer had pulled the latch string
opening the door in a chair by the dying
fire wrapped in his own robe deep in slum-
ber reclined hope dennison the morning
sunlight making a golden aura of her hair

  now what do you know about that
gasped dot travis

vii

  let her sleep was donals dictate and
they willingly obeyed him quietly they
looked in at the door and assured them-
selves that it was really she who was so
peacefully sleeping in the house of a hun-
dred steps then they gathered in the big
kitchen at the back where they would not
disturb the lovely usurper of the house

  kee chow explained how he had trailed
hope and having found her had sent a mes-
senger to bring littee missee to her and
having finished his tale began to prepare
breakfast

  donal frazer stood at the door listening
hush she is moving about he whispered

  hope had awakened to look about the
strange room in great wonder at finding her-
self there then she remembered and one
by one the experiences of the night came
back to her she sighed wistfully for she
was still lost penniless and friendless in
this unknown city as she turned to the
window her eyes fell upon a picture of de
garcia there could be no mistake it
was a full length photograph just so he had
looked before he climbed the fire-escape to
-what

  the beneficent but absent owner was evi-
dently a friend of the painter she thought
through him if he would but come she
might learn of de garcia and his friends
she realized that even the mystery and hor-
ror of the artists last cry did not give him
first place in her interest she wanted
most to learn of donal frazer if he was
searching for her or had thought of her


short stories

after she was gone she picked up one of
the books on the table and turned to the
fly-leaf there on the inner cover she saw
a book-plate ex libris donal frazer hur-
riedly she took up book after book all
were marked with the same name

  the opening of the door caused her to
look up donal frazer was coming toward
her white of face but in his eyes a look that
enwrapped her with warmth comfort and
safety unconsciously her hands went forth
to meet him and a feeling of having reached
home came over her

  you are safe-safe he whispered
hoarsely can you ever forgive me for
the horrors you have been through a
flush spread across his face reddening the
temples he stammered and his hands
gripped hers painfully hopes eyes filled
with little dancing glints of light

  you forgive me all the fright of this
night i can never forgive myself his
eyes pleaded

  frankly honestly her face lifted to his
i think she said i have found friends
her voice halted shyly on the word in this
frightful night that  would go through more
nights of terror to retain

  the door creaked and dots voice sound-

ed through the crack o lord high cham-
berlain maynt we come in there are
five of us dying in the ante-chamber to
greet her majesty let er umble servants
enter

  come in come in my friends cried
hope eager with excitement she was still
in donals robe her hair loosened in her
sleep was tumbling about her shoulders but
she neither knew nor cared they rushed
in dot rouge rosaria and de garcia and
fairly flung themselves upon her with joy-
ous exclamations and questionings while
kee chow looked in from the kitchen smil-
ing blandly clasping hands they danced
wildly about her and hope dennison the
cultured the carefully reared took dot
travis the salvation army lass of doubtful
past in her arms and kissed her full upon
the lips my dear little friend she said
warmly

  then came a clattering knock at the door
who is there called donal

  riandardo came the answer and hope
recognized the voice of her musical milk-
man

  come in she cried you too my
friend ah we are together now-all my
friends of the small hours

big game teddy might have spared

 mr roosevelt having captured the attention of every one in every corner of the globe

 pity but her small brother seemed plunged in deep thought by the remark and after
 shaking his head with a mighty sigh remarked maybe he wouldnt have shot him

the spirit of the service

             by donald francis mcgrew
             author of the blood that binds etc

     in which a cynical young heiress learns something
     from lieutenant gordon macdonald of the philippine
     constabulary and a moro chief and the service in spite
     of machine guns and an ambuscade makes a real soldier

when a youth of twenty-
four has been more than
usually hard hit by the
charms of a young
woman and finds in a
crisis that she has little or nothing worth
mentioning beneath the surface he is more
than apt to make a blithering ass of himself
but lieutenant-of-philippine-constabulary
gordon macdonald had a distinct horror of
resembling a blithering ass on any occa-
sion while he was not laughing and rol-
licking like a cow-puncher headed for town
his keen face showed no trace of sorrow
and as he rode into camp keithley he
softly hummed a tune it ran something
like this

    her french ways are all a bluff

    shes as french as paddy duff

    i wonder where she gets that stuff-
    she lives down in our alley

  he was still humming the air when hav-
ing left his horse at thc battery stables he
rounded the corner of the ordnance store-
house on his way to headqurters- there
he broke off and stopped short wt an
ejaculation of surprise

  not more than ten paces away a young
woman sat on a camp stool facing in ar
lists easel ip front of her was an eifcep

tionally tall moro warrior naked save for
his breech cloth and posed in the act of
swinging a wicked four-foot bolo possess-
ing a pair of shoulders that any athlete
would have envied he tapered from head
to ankles like some beautifully proportioned
statue crouched before him in an ecstacy
of fear and pleading was a moro girl in a
purple robe her blue-black hair falling in
cascades over her smooth brown shoulders
touched the ground on either side

  he looked at the pair only once and then
his eyes returned to the artist he would
not have called her beautiful as the word is
commonly applied there was a severely
classical symmetry in the lines of the long
sharp nose the firm masculine chin the
wide gray eyes hers was an unusual face
more it was an attractive and even a fas-
cinating face it radiated a keen intelli-
gence its coloring was exquisite and
never gordon reflected had he seen such
contrasts in a feminine countenance while
it suggested many masculine traits it never-
theless gave one the impression that she
was filled to her finger tips with all the
subtlety and artistry of womanhood

  so he stared and kept on staring until
she looked up

  well she inquired in low contralto
tones may we go on or may we-


short stories

  gordon whipped off his cap and stepped
forward with profuse apologies

  youre pardoned she said favoring
him with a smile her tone was cordial for
he was a prepossessing boy i was some-
what nettled because the colonel promised
me that every one should be kept away from
this spot until  finished the sitting ali
dhau doesnt like to pose when the white
warriors are watching however  sup-
pose he didnt tell you mr-or is it cap-
tain-

  macdonald lieutenant i do not be-
long here but to the constabulary that is
why i hadnt heard you see

  she looked at him now with frank ad-
miration

  so youre lieutenant macdonald of
pedros pass she exclaimed

  oh please i hope they havent been
telling you a lot of rot about that
saving a whole brigade with but one
company is not rot she said rising to ex-
tend her hand at any rate with a little
deprecatory laugh at her unusual forward-
ness ive heard so much about that fight
that i feel almost acquainted

  now this would have delighted any young
officer who still loved to jingle his spurs
but gordon disliking flattery for the very
reason that he liked it immensely grew
visibly embarrassed he mumbled inarticu-
lately and turned to the moros

  they had relaxed from their pose and
the warrior caught in a foolish act by a
fighting man of the americanos was grin-
ning sheepishly but even as he warmed
to the boyish smile gordon noticed that ali
dhaus left hand was covering a spot on the
biceps of the right arm

  what tribe is this man from he asked
quickly

  i have no idea why

  did you see any mark on his right
arm 

  why yes some sort of brand-a cres-
cent and a star i think

  i thought so when he covered his arm
you see he belongs to the las balos tribe
a badly wanted lot of outlaws

  so thats why i had such a hard time
getting him to uncover for this picture i
thought he wanted to come to this quiet spot
because of his pride

  well that probably had something to do
with it too

  as i found out when i started to hire
him the woman finally persuaded him
she said they needed money badly

  no doubt they do you see before the
americans came no warrior of the las
balos tribe ever tilled a field they de-
pended on raids to supply them with labor
and they practically ruled this section of the
country now it is different before my
company was formed a mountain battery
tried to teach them that slave-taking is
wrong by shelling their barrio so rather
than surrender they retreated to some
mountain lair-which we cant find by the
way-and as the tilling is exceptionally
poor theyve been hard put to it for sub-
sistence otherwise i do not think that
you could have induced him to pose at all
how interesting exclaimed the girl
proud highland warrior too much of the
blue blood to do anything beneath the dig-
nity of a fighting man then she gave
vent to a little cynical laugh and looked
away over the mountains id like to find
a real character like that she said even
if he were only a savage but the fact re-
mains that he did take the money for this
posing like every one else he has his
price

  gordon turned to look at her for the
first time he noted how clearly defined were
the outer and inner edges of her lips his
instincts always sought a medium between
mawkish sentiment and cynicism and a dis-
play of either was never to his taste com-
ing from a girl the latter was especially dis-
pleasing

  i cant say that ive found that to be true
in my experience he said turning back to
ali dhau

  youd find it so if you deliberately set
out to prove the theory

  gordon seemed not tir was eye-
ing the moro s shoulders with a prospective
air and suddenly he asked pardon and
stepped forwarci

  thou art f the las balos he bluntly
declared using the patois

  the young warriors left hand dropped to
join te right on the hilt of the bolo he
neither affirmed nor denied but every
muscle in his body grew tense in readiness
the spirit of the service



  it is not in my heart to arrest thee gor-
don calmly assured him i have come to
ask thee-who take money for a womans
work-to take more money for a mans
work in the constabulary

  ali dhau scowled then hung his head
and dug the big toe of his right foot into the
ground gordon saw him look furtively at
the woman

  the soldiers of the constabulary get
many pesos and much chow for fighting
he continued wouldst thou carry the rifle
of a man with men who conquered dato
pedro o ali dhau

  dato balos has no spawn who serve the
americanos cried the woman her black
eyes blazing ali dhau if thou goest thy
dato will have thy blood

  i give thee my word said gordon ad-
dressing the man and ignoring the woman
if thou partakest of my salt no harm shall
come to thee from dato balos

  if thou goest thou shalt not take me
raged the moro girl

  ali dhau dropped his head still lower
ha cried gordon is a warrior of
the las balos to be led as a carabao with
a ring in his nose-by a woman

  the shot went home shusan mu poga-
ree gritted the moro and he raised the
bolo above the americans head

  the girl moutina laughed ecstatically
miss camden the artist emitted a faint
cry but gordon smiled unconcernedly into
the bloodshot eyes

  a warrior is what he proveth himself
he said quietly

  the light in the moros eyes flickered
suddenly he lowered his bolo and extended
it hilt first to gordon

  before thou takest it he said i have
but one request wilt thou ask me to be-
tray the hiding place of my people

  that i will not ali dhau thou hast my
word

  then i will prove my self a good soldier
for thee o teniente he said placing the
bolo in gordons hands

  moutina pushed forward wfren i have
spoken as i have spoken she crit-d

  ali dhau faced her with an angry growl
since the sultan made thee a free woitian
thou hast talked too much because thou
hast weaved strange stories with thy feet

within his court thinkest thou that thou
canst change a warriors heart light of
the heavens art thou to me but first i am
a man thou comest with me

  the girl raised herself on the balls of her
feet and placing her hands on her hips
twisted sideways in a truly oriental ex-
pression of contempt she looked him up
and down then spat upon the ground in
her rage

  pig she cried when i spoke for
money in the matter of this picture foolish-
ness i did not think of betraying our peo-
ple i go with no las balos who taketh
money to fight his own tribe

  with a grunt of rage ali dhau leaped
toward her but moutina jumping back-
ward wheeled and fled down the path to-
ward marahui

  thou canst beat me only when thou art
a man of thine own people she called
back over her shoulder

  for a space the future of gordons re-
cruit hung in the balance he had taken
no formal oath and even his great rage
could not hide the intense longing with
which he eyed her departing back he ran
a matter of ten paces toward her before he
remembered and returned to face his new
commander

  see what much kindness hath brought
me he grunted that is what a man re-
ceiveth when he giveth ear to the talk of a
freed woman o teniente

  why didst thou not beat her long ago
asked gordon knowing the breed

  if a moro can be said to blush this one
did at least he avoided gordons eyes and
dug his big toe into the dirt

  allah hath not permitted me to under-
stand this foolishness which hath come over
me he mumbled in shamed and perplexed
tones

  gordons soft brown eyes grew a trifle
misty as he smiled down at bowed black
head had he not known his man he would
have patted him on the shoulder instead
he only said allah alloweth none of us to
understand that o ali dhau and when the
moro straightened his own face had re-
sumed a grave business-like aspect

  i have business that will keep me two
hours he said at the end of that time
we will depart then as the moro ac-


short stories

knowledged the order he turned back to
miss camden

  i have enlisted this man in the constab-
ulary he informed that somewhat breath-
less young woman and i think that i owe
you several apologies

  dorothy camden thought so too she
was not at all used to being neglected nor
was she especially fond of losing sub-
jects but for the moment she was think-
ing of ali dhaus upraised bolo

  possibly  can get another model she
said never mind that and she looked
at him with something of admiration and a
great deal of puzzled wonder that was
the first time i ever saw an officer face a
very tight little moment will you tell me
why you did it

  again gordon flushed at any other time
he might have replied flippantly stating that
the government gave beautiful leather
medals once a year for these performances
just now her direct gaze was disconcerting

  well he stammered a fellow couldnt
very well make an ass of himself by run-
ning away could he

  no of course not but you might have
jumped back and drawn your pistol-pre-
pared to defend yourself you know you
just stood still and smiled why did you
do it

  gordon was growing decidedly uncom-
fortable he saw that he was not going to
put this extraordinary young woman off
with jokes about leather medals

  there is only one real basic reason he
said as easily as he could it all helps to
make ali dhau and his kind better soldiers
a soldier cant very well look up to an offi-
cers uniform if the officer in it allows the
yellow in him to run away with his head
yes yes i can reason that out too
but what is it the government offers you
for taking such chances what is it that
you expect to get out of it

  it was then that gordon fully sensed how
far she was from understanding men who
give the best of themselves for the pure
love of the work her standards were en-
tirely materialistic and in analyzing the
psychology of peoples actions she in-
variably sought for a material motive she
measured life only as a period of time in
which one could grasp all manner of pleas-

ures therefore it seemed a very dea

	thing to place at stake while adding one
  mere soldier to the constabulary

    im afraid he said at last that i could
  not very well explain that without appear-
  ing too damnably-oh well sentimental
  and all that rot you know i get a great deal
  out of it though not exactly what you
  mean then with a little laugh to hide his
  own embarrassment ill tell you if youre
  here a year from now ask ali dhau hell
  be able to explain it to you by then

    miss camden was still puzzled and skep-
  tical i doubt it she smiled ive seen
  his initial motive he went into the con-
  stabulary for money and no doubt hell
  stay for the same reason

   he went in for money acknowledged
  gordon but hell stay for something else
  then as the provincial governor loomed up
  in the distance he took advantage of his
  advent to plead urgent business

    thus he extricated himself from a rather
  uncomfortable situation later he rode off
  toward his hill station with ali dhau he
  told himself that he had forgotten the
  strange artist and to prove it he hummed
  a verse which ran as follows

  now the bosuns mate was a man see-date
  but fond of amusement too

  so he played hop-scotch with the starboard
          watch

  while the captain tickled the crew

  and the cook was dutch and behaved as
        such

  for the diet he fed the crew-ew-ew
  was a number of tons of hot cross buns
  served up with sugar and glue

    nevertheless in the days that followed
  he was annoyed to find that dorothy cam-
  dens face occasionally came up before him
  this was not surprising since she was so
  unusual as to be almost unique jut no
  woman had any righ t to make such a dis-
  tinct impression up-on him after his recent
  experience furthermore he kept their
  different points of view in mind and deter-
  mined not o make a bally ass of himself
  again e ven if he did happen to be lonely
  he hiad forgotten however to take doro-
  thy oamden into his calculations this
  young woman had been left an enormous
  income at an immature age and among
the spirit of the service



other things she had attracted enough men
in her tempestuous career to make her
somewhat contemptuous now that the
shoe appeared to be fitting the other foot
she began to realize some of the sensations
of a bad little girl who cannot always
have just what she wants when she wants it

   if youre honest she said to the blush-
ing face in her glass youll admit-youll
admit- then she called herself a sen-
timental fool and declared that she would
pack and leave at once-and went directly
down stairs to tell captain and mrs haynes
that she liked the scenery and the savage
characters very very much she liked
them so much in fact that she intended to
fit up a little studio and stay on with them
indefinitely

  but the hastily erected studio seemed to
have little attraction for gordon during
the next two months he rode into keithley
but three times naturally he called at the
studio on his rounds but some other officer
was usually there and he never made the
slightest attempt to see her alone when
chance did throw them together he shunned
all comparisons of personal viewpoints
which pave the way to more intimate under-
standing

  this enraged her as much as the change
which was creeping over her against her will
she sensed the opinion that he had formed
of her and it hurt she was not selfish at
heart but generous to a fault she wanted
to believe the things that this boy stood for
but all her experience had substantiated the
opposite even the regular officers-who
abhorred sentimentalism-said quite frank-
ly that they soldiered only in the hope of
some day replacing a man higher up they
took chances because it was necessary she
never saw the young officers touch the col-
ors when alone and neither had she
watchec an officers mess giving a toast to
the servi- itcquejitly she could not
believe other than she did and as this
served as a barrier between them she hated
it she also hated herself fcr caring and
him for the altogether sweet anj courteous
position he had taken up behind it

  at their third meeting some of it blazed
out before she could check it do yu
know she exclaimed that you are alto-
gether impossible mr macdonald

  gordon eyed her in amazement i i
dont quite understand

  she had meant his blindness but she
martialed her womans wits to hide her er-
ror it is because i am so interested in the
natives and the work of the constabulary
she said quickly and you who are in
close touch with them seldom tell me any-
thing about them you havent even told
me of ali dhau

  im sorry im sure ive been quite
stupid ali dhau is still with us

  he likes the money does he

  gordon smiled at this little shaft oh
yes of course then in an attempt to
chance the drift he said he figured in an
interesting little affair with my sergeants
just after he reached the company

  tell me about it please

  why he belonged to the las balos out-
laws as i told you and of course he
knows of their retreat so my sergeants
came to me and said teniente let us give
this man the water cure and make him tell
where it is 

  and

  i told them no i had promised ali
dhau that i would not make him tell against
his will

  but wouldnt the capture of the las
balos be a tremendous feather in your
cap

  naturally

  then why on earth did you make him
such a promise

  great scot cant you see that how
could i ask a man to be a traitor to his own
convictions and honestly expect him to re-
main a fit member of the service at the
same time

  dorothy sat back and eyed him strangely
i wonder she said dreamily i wonder

- then with an abrupt change i

suppose that settled it eh ali dhau came
to you and swore eternal allegiance in grat-
itude 

  gordon frowned a little no he said
slowly i cant say that he did

  no she cried eagerly then these
experiments do not always work do they
in this case he admitted reluctantly
it is a question ali dhau has grown very
surly and quiet of late my men tell me
that moutina has paid a few secret visits


short stories

to the post at night but she has not returned
to him

  so he hesitates between the woman and
the money eh oh well im not surprised
it is only a struggle between one selfish mo-
tive and another you know you cannot
eliminate the basic elements of human na-
ture even in the service

  this parting shot recurred to him many
times upon his homeward ride his in-
stincts told him that more than half her
cynicism had been assumed for his special
benefit but it all hurt nevertheless neither
could he deny her assertions about ali dhau
until he solved his problem however he
could do one thing in the future he could
stay away from places where a fellow was
trapped into making statements that made
him appear a sentimental ass so he deter-
mined to avoid the studio in future

  in due time this had its own effect dor-
othy gave over looking into her glass and
vowed that no man on the earth would ever
make the slightest impression upon her life
to substantiate this declaration she danced
seven times with lieutenant hixon at the
regimental hop snubbed him unmercifully
at the end quarreled with her maid and
then rose from her bed and walked the
veranda until daylight the next night she
rode into gordons highland post with a re-
tinue of native servants

  i expected to arrive in time to pitch a
camp by daylight she said to him when
he came running down the hill my
muchachos didnt know your horrid trails

  the boy stared at her at a temporary loss
for words

  please dont she smiled with some-
thing like a challenge in her eyes ive
only come out to ask you if i cant have ali
dhau for a few hours a day after drill for i
simply could not get another model to finish
that picture

  glad you came he said regaining him-
self but if you intended to pose ali
dhau im very much afraid that you arrive
just in time to see your hopes go glimmer-
ing

  you dont mean that he is running
away

  i dont know but i fear the woist as
they say in the third act at any rate i can
only stay a minute ill show your mucha-

chos where to pitch camp and then i must
run back up the hill

  she turned at his words to look at the
small mesa in question it rose directly be-
hind the boys quarters on the summit
clearly outlined against the light of a crack-
ling fire a moro soldier stood beside a large
victrola this was rendering in the hall
of the mountain king while on the slope
she discerned the faint outlines of many sol-
diers all stretched at ease and listening to
the music

  how picturesque she cried couldnt
i go up and catch the color of all that too
for some reason he hesitated an instant
then suddenly decided in the affirmative
and after showing her muchachos the site
for her camp he led her up past the little
soldiers to the summit here he paused to
question the sergeant in charge of the ma-
chine then he turned back to dorothy and
led her to his camp chair

  i suppose she said after listening to
one of brahms hungarian dances that all
this is designed to help you instill the en-
nobling-ahem-lessons of the service
he grinned oh yes of course i
also read them excerpts from the buffalo
bill weekly or sing them snatches from
the walloping window blind

  bravo she cried well at any rate
they seem to appreciate it the whole com-
pany is down there is it not

  this time gordon did not smile no
not to-night some of them are out keep-
ing an eye on our mutual friend ali dhau
she quickened perceptibly oh yes
ali dhau you started to tell me down be-
low

  well as i said ali dhau has been sulk-
ing so ive kept men watching him five
nights ago moutina came here and i was
able to slip up and overhear the conversa-
tion she told him that if he would pretend
to betray his own ppfjjft-jiltlead us into a
trap dato balos would make him a teniente
dato while she vvould be his slave for life

  that time ali dhau refused but we
know that he received a bark message from
a passinpo caravan to-day and he did not
come t o listen to the music to-night so i
had hm followed and they tell me that hes
now under a ledge down there on the river
ba-nk no doubt he is waiting for moutina

  to desert

  gordons reply was cut short by the ap-

  aarance of an armed sentry he pushed

is way out of the grass in their rear and
came directly to his commander

  banca come cross de ribber sir he re-
ported

  very well ill have to leave you miss
camden

  oh couldnt i come if i keep perfectly
quiet

  in answer he gave her a shrewd apprais-
ing glance then took her hand and with
her followed the sentry into the grass

  i dont know whether ali dhau intends
to desert or not he said answering her
question at last if he does i have a squad
across the river to intercept him

  oh

  ive also instructed the sergeant to keep
on playing the phonograph that is to im-
press ali dhau with the fact that we are all
around the hill but we must keep quiet
now

  a minute later they struck a gentle slope
and from this point onward they stepped
with exquisite care finally after a seem-
ing age of suspense gordon squeezed her
hand bringing her to a standstill

  as they dared not part the grass in front
of them she could not see the river but
she heard voices not more than ten feet be-
low them and these she knew must have
come from moutina and ali dhau the dif-
ferences in their tones were unmistakable
the womans rose and fell now cutting like
a thin knife now caressing and pleading in
soft throaty gutturals the man spoke less
volubly with masculine moro grunts and
though she could not understand a word of
the patois she listened with intense interest
until the voices ceased and the splash of a
paddle heralded the departure of the banca
th varyng inflections told their own story

  did il g wnh her she asked search-
ing gordons troubled proe when they had
regained the summit

  no he told her

  though she burned with curio-ty- the evi-
dent reluctance with which he answered
checked any further questions  was
patent that he wished to think so fr a
time she allowed him to sit and stare iiat
the fire

  he was still sitting there when ali dhau
having worked his way back to the barracks
in supposed secrecy came up the hill and
halted before his company commander
she hardly recognized her long-haired war-
rior in this clean-shaven close-cropped sol-
dier yet he had lost none of his savage
splendor the snappy red fez the trig
blue shirt and the neat khaki riding trous-
ers only served to accentuate the splendid
lines of his tall muscular figure he stood
out clean-cut against the firelight like some
figure cast from bronze

  could i hold speech with the teniente
alone he asked saluting

  gordons face was carefully inexpressive
is it very important o ali dhau

  of the greatest o teniente

  very well said gordon he then ad-
dressed dorothy do you care to go down
and see the rest

  at her eager assent the three went down
the hill to his quarters there he led them
into the library

 well he said when dorothy was
seated

  ali dhau his fez crushed between ner-
vous fingers looked askance at dorothy
then at a word of assurance from gordon
he plunged into his story

  if she had expected anything theatrical
dorothy was disappointed the moro met
his commanders gaze with a frankness that
was too frank but beyond that he might
have been making an ordinary report
when he had finished gordon asked him a
few questions in the patois and then quietly
dismissed him

  up on the summit dorothy had been able
to suppress her curiosity now it burst
bounds

well she cried what did he say
gordon crossed one leg over the other
and tapped at his knee with the end of his
cigarette he gazed thoughtfully at his
boot the while

  ali dhau told me that he could not eat
the salt of two peoples he said finally
so he promised to lead us to dato balos
secret retreat and i accepted his offer
but hes going to lead you into an am-
buscade isnt he

  yes

  the girl leaned forward her eyes wide


short stories

do you mean to tell me she cried that
you are actually going to allow him to do
this when you know that he is lying

  it does look rather that way

  but why on earth dont you arrest him
well see here now-suppose you had a
wild horse that you were trying to tame
and the horse longing for the freedom of
the prairies bucked against the restraint of
the saddle girth and in so doing fell and
broke his leg you wouldnt set about heal-
ing that leg by breaking his head would
you

  of course not-if the horse was worth
taming this animal has already proved
himself worthless

  no not quite

  she looked at him in amazement
well she said at last that sort of rea-
soning is too deep for me ill give it up
but come now-confess isnt there some
other reason for not arresting him
well of course ali dhau is the only one
here who knows the las balos hiding place
ha now were getting at it the
prime factor in the problem is the little
item in the official reports dato balos no-
torious outlaw captured by- 

  on the contrary gordon cut in dato
balos is a secondary factor in my calcu-
lations

  the girl almost stamped her foot in her
bewilderment who or what is the most
important then

  gordon looked at her his brown eyes
were frank and serious on the surface but
in their depths she sensed the veriest hint
of mirth

  why the service is of course

  this brought dorothy to her feet lieu-
tenant macdonald she exclaimed if i
were your older sister id shake you for
youve allowed me to become so fearfully
interested in this that im in a perfect men-
tal fuddle and now you wont explain it
isnt fair

  the boy laughed outright at this outburst
no he admitted i havent been fair
then he became serious and a touch of
color showed under the tan of his cheeks
if i tell you what is in my mind will you
believe me and not think me foolish
dorothy sat down facing him of
course ill believe you

  well then its just this i cant a
rest ali dhau and do any possible good f
the service of course i would if i had t
but i will not unless i do have to you see
the constabulary on mindanao is still more
or less of an experiment we have to im-
press these natives with the fact that this
organization is good that it is efficient that
it is worth while belonging to jailing ali
dhau would seem to reflect upon him alone
at first sight but there are usually two sides
to a question hed stand forth as a unit
upon whom the system had failed fur-
thermore hed leave prison with hatred for
the constabulary in his heart and you can
imagine how far his words would go toward
helping us make the impression i have
spoken of

  why thats all clear enough but i
dont see how you are going to cure him by
sticking your head into this noose

  i dont know that i am im only going
to seize every chance i have

  i cant see a single one

  i can

  well

  that smiled gordon is part of my
dark secret ill tell you about it some day
if i have a chance to try it

  the girl bent her head her brows knit
and her lips pursed in a smile that was half
cynical finally she raised her eyes to his

  well she said i must say that it
sounds well-even if i cant understand how
you hope to make a good soldier out of ali
dhau what i do understand is this-you
say you think you have a chance to and
youve also practically said that youre go-
ing to risk your own life for the sake of this
one single almost worthless savage but
what is at the back of it all why are you
going to do it

  a dark red mottled the boys face you
said that you would believe me he remind-
ed her somewhat stiffly i mem exactly
what i said-barring that rot about the
risks

  dorothy w-nced inwardly before his
words and then became furious it was the
gulf between them outlined more distinctly
than ever all the emotions of the past
wees swept through her with renewed
force she hated herself for caring but
most of all she hated this boy who seemed
the spirit of the service	

  prove out all that in which she could not
ielieve bah that was it he only
seemed to if she could prove this if she

could humiliate him-

  with the thought a great inspiration
came to her

  lieutenant macdonald she said turn-
ing back to him ill have to beg your par-
don she faced him easily enough know-
ing that her color would pass for that of
contrition i do believe you and i am
convinced that you are absolutely sincere
the apparent sincerity of her own deep-
ened tones made gordon lower his eyes
he was now ashamed of his rudeness

  i believe you are absolutely sincere
she repeated and to my mind it follows
that a sincere man must be honest well
im glad of that and ill tell you why if
i have offended you at times with my-er-
cynical curiosity please know that there was
a method in my madness i have been look-
ing for an honest man for a long while
to reward him as they do in the sunday
school books grinned gordon in an at-
tempt to hide his pleasant discomfiture

  no no im not joking ive been bilked
and bamboozled until im tired of it thats
all and im looking for an honest business
manager if youll take the place ill send
you back to new york at my own expense
and pay you the same salary that im paying
the man who holds the place now and
she named a figure amounting to ten times
his present salary

  gordon slowly uncrossed his legs but
i have had no business experience he
said

  that makes little difference to me a
man who has had military training can soon
pick up details and it will be cheaper for
me to pay for a few months of mistakes
than several years of rascality

  gofdon arose and paced back and forth
his hands thrust into his pockets in a de-
cidedly unmilitary mannc-r- new york-
broadway-the opera-a decent cocktail
now and then-a well appointed bachelors
apartment near central park-vh it sound-
ed great-ripping by george h would
like to canter over the driveways- he
would even give a great deal to see the
children dancing on the sidewalks of wash-
ington square and when he thought f

the brevoort with its delightful french at-
mosphere-oh what in hell did life in this
god-forsaken wilderness offer him any-
way

  by james he exclaimed the very
thought of it gets me like a ninth inning
rally in the bleachers i think that-that

   just then someone knocked at the door
he opened it to face ali dhau

   the las balos was unused to the ways of
deception ali dhau feared that his previ-
ous reluctance might give gordon cause to
wonder at his sudden change and he was
not altogether certain that he had been con-
vincing therefore he returned to further
impress gordon with his fidelity

   if by any chance it is allahs will that
we fight dato balos with little success said
he and it is so written that i am about to
fall into his hands wilt thou remember thy
promise to keep me from him for know
thou o teniente that i would prefer thy
bullet if all else fail to his torture

   a change came over the boy the eager-
ness and wistfulness with which he had
dreamed of new york gave way to some-
thing that made him older and steadier
and as his brown eyes had softened when
ali dhau had bowed his head before the
confusion of love so did they soften now

   go to thy bed and sleep like a soldier
ali dhau i will take care of thee

   then he turned to dorothy and gave her
his answer

   that answer made it necessary for her to
return to keithley for the constabulary
company departed at dawn bound for the-
las balos retreat

 at an interjunction with one of the
keithley trails a mountain battery joined
them the three-inch guns in this branch
of the service are carried in pieces upon the
backs of mules and are usually in plain
sight this day they were covered with
canvas while ali dhau had never seen the
american guns that shot the length of
mindanao he had noted their effect and
a glance at one of the detached barrels
might have awakened his suspicions and
caused him to lead them to some out-of-the-
way place so he was told quite casually
that this was a pack train carrying supplies


short stories

  late on the second afternoon they arrived
at a point near the las balos retreat and
gordon asked ali dhau to point out a con-
venient ridge from which he could see the
casa

  the moro led him to a wooded ridge that
overlooked a valley some three thousand
yards in width at first gordon could see
nothing resembling a dwelling but when
ali dhau pointed out an expanse of shrub-
bery about a thousand yards away he un-
derstood dato balos had simply thatched
over a huge space between two rocky hol-
lows and covered the usual nipa roof with
boughs gordon pointed this out to his bat-
tery commander and the latter suppressing
a grin of satisfaction grew busy with his
glasses then leaving the pack train on
the ridge for safetys sake gordon and
ali returned to their company

  with the fall of night they started wend-
ing their way into the dark valley and at
eight ali dhau turned round to whisper that
he had found the entrance-a long gut be-
tween two ledges of rock thatched over
with nipa and branches

  see teniente he whispered  they are
so certain of their safety that they do not
even keep a man at watch here thou hast
but to rush in thy company and they will all
be caught helpless before they can reach
their bolos

  the new soldiers teeth chattered with ex-
citement as he spoke for he knew that every
warrior in the casa had his bolo in his hands
and that part of them were crouching just
above the entrance to make the trap com-
plete but he did not know that gordon
was also aware of it that the sergeants had
quietly distributed a number of pipe-torches
behind him in the dark that a few of the
men were already creeping up the side of
the casa toward the roof that fifty had been
detailed to remain at the entrance and that
a small detachment from the battery with
hand-machine guns had been following the
company so he mistook gordons low
chuckle for a sign of elation at the coming
capture

  all right gordon whispered lead the
way ali dhau

  the las balos nodded excitedly and went
ahead he proceeded stealthily enough for
a space but when he reached the spit where

the flickering rays of the inner fires lighti
the tunnel he broke into a run and gor
don taking up the double-time behind
him came round a turn and into full view
of the casa

  the sight of it brought a gasp from him
for it was an imposing spectacle around
the edges of the huge room were arranged
a number of small huts their doors and
windows crowded with women and children
in front of these and standing in double
rank was an army of las balos warriors
they were evidently divided into companies
for one group carried old flint match-locks
the second four-foot bolos and the third
double-edged barongs the fourth was
armed with long-handled shovel-bladed
spears they stood erect their match-
locks and bolos at the carry and their
great spears pointing in alignment at the
roof and from the tall teniente datos to
the last man among them they presented
the finest examples of physical perfection
that gordon had ever seen

  he was given only a second in which to
review them not far from the centre of
the enclosure the tribe had erected a
thatched hut which boasted a gaudily dec-
orated veranda on this veranda seated
under a yellow canopy gordon discerned
the figure of dato balos some thirty feet
away ali dhau had dropped to his knees
before him

  o dato he cried in the hush i have
brought thee the price of my redemption
a great howl of derisive laughter arose
from the women then from among them
there sped the girl moutina she danced in
front of ali dhau her teeth exposed in a de-
risive smile

  thou hast brought thy carrion self to
death she chanted o thou bastard

americanisto thou double-dealing fool-

  hold thy tongue woman thundered
dato balos rising to his full height his
robes fell away with the movement uncov-
ering a mighty chest cross-belted with gold
and glittering with medals it is not given
to women to pronounce sentence on men
an jvnerican sergeant behind gordon
whispered cant we open the ball with
these machine guns sir

  oordon checked him with a sharp hold
steady till i give the word and then mo-
the spirit of the service



tioned to one of his own sergeants with
him he strode forward to a position beside
ali dhau the latter was just rising in
dazed confusion to his feet

  who is it thou wouldst sentence o lion
of the hills cried gordon

  the las balos chieftain folded his arms
across his breast and regarded gordon with
an indulgent smile at any other time the
boy would have thrilled to the sight of it
the man was superb in his arrogant assur-
ance he was so certain of his position
that he could afford to waste time in satisfy-
ing his savage love of the theatrical

  what commission hast thou from allah
that gives thee right to ask o americano
my commission is not from allah but
from the united states government i am
come to serve its warrant upon thee o un-
broken spear shaft and unless thou sur-
render quietly there shall be blood between
heads and shoulders

  again the women cackled but dato balos
silenced them with a roar this done he
looked gordon up and down with an eye
that held no small amount of admiration

  thou are a brave man with much
humor he said howbeit there shall be
yet another score against me when i have
dealt with this bastard moslem who ate of
thy accursed swine and how wilt thou ar-
rest me for thine own death can a dead
man serve as his own avenger can a

dead man-

  but gordon saw that ali dhau had heard
enough he stood gazing from moutina to
the dato his black eyes filled with horror
seizing him by the right wrist with his own
right hand gordon whipped him round
facing the constabulary simultaneously he
thrust his left arm under the right elbow of
ali dhau and his right hand pressed sharp-
ly downward with this jiu-jitsu come-
ajar he jerked the moro on a run toward
the coritany-

  at the same instant his sergeant leaped
upon moutina securing t he same hold
though she screamed with rage and pain
she too was forced to follow

  these actions signaled the beginning of
chaos before gordon reached his ranks
a dozen torches had been ignited savling
over the heads of the las balos th ese
landed upon the roofs of the huts simul-

taneously the roof above them began to
crackle with flames while the machine guns
at a yell from gordon went into action with
a roar they mowed down the foremost
moros in swaths the remainder charging
forward at the commands of their tenientes
were met by the combined fire of the ma-
chine guns and the constabulary rifles

  rushing in among his men gordon turned
ali dhau over to a corporal and then
wheeled to handle his retreat he had no
intention of getting his men into a hand-to-
hand conflict if he could avoid it he started
them out through the tunnel meeting each
assault with a stand by the machine guns
as soon as the gut was cleared they ran
back a few yards when the raging tenientes
led on another rush the constabulary
checked them with a hail of lead

  out at the entrance a furious encounter
was in progress between the two reserves
but this came to an abrupt ending with the
addition of one of the machine guns con-
fused by this merciless thing which sprayed
lead as a fire-hose throws water the las
balos reserve broke into unsteady groups
the coming of a second machine gun
routed them and they fell back into the
woods

  just the same the others will be boiling
out of that fire trap in a minute panted
gordon addressing the battery sergeant
our only chance to nail them is to stick
right here where we can command the tun-
nel im going to send up the rocket

  let er go sir grunted the sergeant
training his gun down the cut well stick

  a second later a rocket soared into the
sky trailing a six-inch band of flaming red
behind it

  they waited for five-eight-ten seconds
inside the enclosure the hubbub had dwin-
dled until they could distinguish authorita-
tive voices the tenientes were reorganizing
their men for a rush that would offset their
momentary confusion before the machine
guns and prove that no las balos tribe
would ever be defeated by the despised
christian hirelings

  by god ill hand it to em for gameness
with that roof burning over their heads
grunted the battery sergeant

  then a dull boom sounded in the distance
and the heavens seemed to split apart some


short stories

twenty feet from the machine gun the
air was filled with flying missiles and a bat-
teryman fell across gordons feet a sec-
ond shell exploded within ten feet of the
inner entrance and then with a crash that
deafened them two shells burst at once in
the very centre of the great roof

  and they did the business smiled gor-
don telling dorothy of the affair six weeks
later the las balos came out on the run
but there we were facing them with the
machine guns and our rifles even then we
had to knock em galley west with a volley
before theyd stop and then another shell
made a mess of them poor old dato balos
his men were carrying him in the lead-all
shot up too-and he was sobbing with rage
why art thou not man enough to fight us
man to man he yelled at me stop these
devil-things which come from novhere and
we will beat thee with our naked hands
thou carrion and damme if it didnt make
me feel ashamed for it was hardly fair was
it but of course i had to take them in
and so now the whole outfit is under guard
at the convict camp above overton waiting
for the provincial governors sentence

  i hope he isnt too hard on them said
dorothy eyeing him with a pride that she
found hard to conceal he had just returned
from a second march of two weeks dura-
tion and he was grimy and stubbled with
beard but she seemed rather fond of look-
ing at him and did so to her hearts con-
tent

  she was a somewhat different dorothy
from the girl who had offered him the man-
agership if she were not altogether tamed
she was at least subdued and she was glad
of it she had been absolutely convinced
that there are people in the world whose
values are not entirely materialistic and the
thought of it had sweetened her mind

  as for gordon he would have stared at
you had you suggested that they were in
love on the other hand he was ready to
tell the world at large that they were the
very best of friends--oh ripping

  yes i do hope he is not too hard on
them she repeated but aside from that
ive a large large bone to pick with you

  what is it o exception to thy curious
sex

  you neednt laugh i want to know all
about ali dhau

  well he smiled i wanted to wait un-
til he returned but i suppose ill have to tell
you

  you see when we returned to the post
my sergeants wanted me to place him in the
guard house but of course i didnt

  all this surprised ali dhau as much as
it did the rest of the men-who would not
speak to him he was too much a las
balos to come and beg for mercy but i saw
him looking at me now and again as though
he were wondering wondering and he
was he was wondering what sort of tor-
ture i had in mind for him and no doubt
had concluded that it was going to be some-
thing hellish since i was spending so much
time planning it

  we only had one conversation that
was in relation to moutina he asked me
what disposition i would make of her i
turned her over to him gave him one of the
married quarters and told him to beat her
well like a sensible moro he did and
ever since then he has been turning out to
drill with the neatest laundered uniforms in
the company she does them herself

  however he was not wholly happy in
fact i am quite sure that he was acutely
miserable up to the time we started upon
this last hike

  then i had a chance to wreak my hor-
rible vengeance remember hearing of
that triple murder down at misamis we
knew the moro that did it i couldnt send
a squad after him a i needed the whole
company to handle the trouble in bacalog

i could only spare one man-a reliable man
a fellow who would follow the murderer
from here to borneo-a fellow game
enough and loyal enough to snake him out
from under his very datos nose if needs

be and so-

  you sent ali dhau

  move to the head of the class you
win

  dorothy leaned back and clapped her
hands on what an experiment but
arent yo- a afraid hell desert

  her question was answered by gordons
uplifted hand turning with him she list-
ene d to a sound of footsteps that were com-
in  up the walk it was the tread of a man
the spirit of the service



though the soft pad-pad was as light as
the step of a sprightly woman and some-
how before the fellow knocked at the door
dorothys heart leaped to the rhythm of his
movements

  he didnt desert when he was thinking
of those tortures said gordon rising to
his feet as dorothy stepped to the door
then as she opened it what hast thou to
report o ali dhau

  the soldier came in and saluted he was
grimy beyond description he was ragged
and swamp-stained and his head and
breast were bound with bloody bandages
his left hand was behind his back

  the prisoner is in the guardhouse for
the night o teniente

  that is good ali dhau but what is
wrong with thy left hand

  the fierce pride in the soldiers eyes
faded before a mist of confusion some-
what shyly he brought from behind his back

a piece of ham he looked at it with loath-
ing then suddenly dropped on his knees
bowed his head and extended it humbly to
gordon

  i am no woman that i do this he said
but here is flesh of the swine if it be thy
wish thou canst break it upon my head i
am thy man

  for the third time in their acquaintance
the brown eyes grew misty as they looked
on the bent head of ali rhau this time
they were softened with something that a
woman would have called infinitely sweet
stand on thy feet ali dhau he said
and go to thy bed a whole man and a sol-
dier a salute between officer and man is
enough for a man in the service

  and as ali dhau walked out with head
erect gordon looked into the glowing eyes
of the girl who now understood the ser-
vice has its own reward for those who are in
tune with the spirit of its meaning

  harrington gale looked at the speaker
with welcoming astonishment the man
who had introduced himself as merivale
was five foot nothing and clad in overalls
his shirt was open at the neck and his hands
reminiscent of oil but the voice bespoke
education and wider associations than an
electric light power house in the heart of
the mountains of british columbia his
well-kept black hair and sensitive humorous
mouth seemed more akin to the dramatic at-
mosphere of broadway t

which stood outside the railway depot and
gale climbed up by his side leaving his

the horses were swinging along up the
winding hill road and the morning air blew
fresh from the mountains on their right
the swift flowing river ran its turbulent
course bearing on its waves the shingle
bolts of cedar to the expectant mills below
away on their left in the forest the logging
train was creaking its way down with its
freight of giant trees so great that a man
may stand by a fallen trunk and be com-
pletely hidden from view

  nearly two years by day i am just a

  and by night gale listened to his
whimsical self depreciation with interest
he glanced at his hands-which were ar-
tistic-and wondered if a woman were to
blame he divined new york as his spring-

  they reached a sign post pointing to the
left and saw in front of them a woman pick-
ing flowers every moment of the drive had
served to strengthen gales liking for the
quaint little man by his side who evaded
the perils of the narrow road like an in-
spired jehu while he ejaculated farseeing
criticisms on the camp and its dwellers

looked conscious of unearthly wisdom set-
ting her apart in a solitude of pitying smiles
her cheap print dress fitted her body but not
her soul a reincarnated egyptian was
gales silent comment worthy to accept
the homage of kings he thought of the
phrase the twilight of the gods and
wondered lazily if the mountain air were
making him poetical

   she bowed to the two strangers with per-
fect ease and arrived gracefully beside dan-
vers any other woman would have clam-
bered

   a minute or two later the camp came in-
to view a plateau of land perched among
the mountains at the far end the huge
white power house the last word of man
amid the silences of god dominated the
landscape all down the long straggling
street were tidy little cottages with corru-
gated iron roofs glistening in the sun the
homes of a hundred workers on a knoll
in the centre of the village stood a wooden
bungalow proud of its red tiles and flower
garden by the gate was rachael hastings
waiung t ve welcome to her fathers
much traveled guests

   are all the employees here artists redo-
lent of-epigrams asked gale as he sat
by her side in the cool veranda the ques-
tion was idly put but a touch of heightened
color in the girls face warned him that he
was only on the fringe of the surprises this
lonely spot might offer he had met
rachael in new york-a radiant figure--a
whirlwind of enjoyment he had sat by h er

side at dinner more than once and won-
dered whether a ceaseless round of gaiety
wholly satisfied her

  isnt he interesting she answered
no one here knows anything about him
he has quite a library and a violin all the
children in the place adore him

  any further conversation was interrupted
by the arrival of mr hastings a tall thin
man with a goatee beard and a hustle his
upper lip was clean shaven he reminded
gale of pictures of uncle sam

  we are going to take you for a cruise
up the river he said after a hearty greet-
ing i want you to see how we have tamed
the resources of nature

  they walked through the village and
climbed a flight of stairs beside the power
house an exclamation of surprise broke
from gales lips in front of them lay the
river broadened into a flat sheet of water
dammed back by immense masonry the out-
flow regulated by giant sluices

  let me introduce our engineer jack
barnard to you said mr hastings as they
stepped on board a petrol launch

  gale remembered merivales terse de-
scription a scotchman who does not give
anything away and smiled at the brawny
viking who nodded pleasantly to him

  the scene as the boat moved cautiously
up stream was weird and desolate the
river dammed back to create an increased
pressure for the turbines of the power
house had slowly but inevitably flooded the
whole of the narrow valley between the
mountain ranges on either side the chan-
nel turned and twisted amid snags and
dripping moss-grown branches that rose
threateningly above the surface as the
launch throbbed onward through an endless
avenue of trees dead or doomed because
their roots were drowned dank and mat-
ted the remnants of luxuriant bushes and
undergrowth swayed uneasily to the rippling
waves-splashes of sunlight gleamed on
endless aisles of water that opened up
through the mazes of the dying forest they
passed the relics of what had once been
homes isolated uninhabitable shacks sur-
rounded by water and reeking with damp
some of them half buried by the flood
others with the roof tops barely showing a
changeless wilderness of hopelessness and


short stories

decay how deep is it flooded asked
gale he had watched it in fascinated si-
lence for miles leaving danvers to talk to
miss hastings and her father

  about fifteen feet at present answered
mr hastings

  at present

  yes-the dam is built high enough to
raise the water another ten feet we shall
do it before long

  then even these roofs will vanish its
the loneliest thing i have ever seen he
turned to the girl who was standing by his
side he felt she would understand his feel-
ing more than her father who worshipped
power as his only idol

  these dead trees always look to me
like lifes failures she said softly dumb
with the unexplained tragedy of their ex-
istence

  gale smiled back she thought she heard
him murmur something about less than
dust but before she could ask him he went
slowly forward to talk to jack barnard in
the engine room by the end of the voyage
he knew much that there was to know about
the towing of lumber he felt he could cross-
examine an expert on swifters and swifter-
wires and dangers of logs jumping booms in
a choppy sed he loved the reserve strength
of the big engineer in mind and body and
appreciated the fascination he might have
for the woman with the dark mysterious
eyes

  at the dance in the evening gale strolled
across to renew the acquaintance and ask
one more question as to the best means of
securing logs of differing lengths in a boom
the engineer clad in the freedom of flan-
nels and a soft collar was restless and pre-
occupied gale drifted slowly away an
amused spectator the long low room was
decorated with flags and an air of light-
hearted irresponsibility prevailed the
clear cut distinctions between employer and
worker skilled electrician and beginner
seemed to have vanished enjoyment was a
right unrestricted by differences of salary
the three months visit of mr hastings had
effected wonders he realized that the
gaiety of women alleviates isolation and
tends to masculine contentment and hard
work

  gale watched the door and saw rachael

and mrs ranger enter together a striking
contrast rouge et noir he smiled to
himself as he caught the gleam of rachaels
burnished hair jack barnard gravitated to-
ward them his manner was perfect baf-
fling detection but when the band struck up
the widow was his partner dancing with the
dreamy grace that breathed of spices and
the desert and all the untrammelled whis-
perings of the east

  it was not till late that merivale claimed
rachael as his partner he looked up at
her-and then down again at himself-with
a wrinkled smile devoid of bitterness as if
deprecating the providence that had made
her tall and graceful

  shall we go outside instead of dancing

  she loved his gentle humor disarming
the need of closely guarded pity and nodded
acquiescence

  they wandered out into the silence and
reached the edge of the gorge away in
the distance beneath them the river crooned
its hymn of longing for the sea a soft breath
of air from the pine-clad ridges freshened
the heat of the summer night and the great
dome of stars hung above the tiny village-
pinnacled in loneliness away from the
world

  im not surprised that moses went up to
a mountain top to get the commandments
he began abruptly but his voice was tinged
with incurable regret

  inspiration

  yes-but i wonder whether anything
that is his means you must not covet your
neighbors body i suppose barnard is my
neighbor even though he lives in the same
house

  she did not know whether she wanted to
laugh or cry she remembered how con-
scious she had been of his lack of height
when she first met him of late she had
forgotten it she had learned to asme
that he was tall as she had leanvy to as
sume everythingjjse unknown in his favor

  but you hae so many things that he
might covet

  have v he murmured have i its
rather saj to be lonely

  shejveted her gaze on the foaming
wat

  what have i got-what can i ever have
hewent on sadly to make me less lonely
unspeakable evidence



  you have your books--and your music
she tried to speak lightly

  i ask for bread and you offer me a stone
-my books and my music have lost their
voices god help me i hear only yours
now

  she turned and looked at him the thin
ascetic face was gray and drawn all the
delicate lines of whimsical humor of gentle
deprecating laughter at himself and the
world had vanished

  then why not hear it

  there was a shadow of a smile about her
lips as with effortless dignity she stretched
a hand toward him

 you mean you could-

  i mean i shall

  but an oiler

  she laughed contentedly at his tone of
horror a shooting star flashed across the
sky and she wished him well

   should not mind if you were a good
oiler-but you are not they say youve no
education in machinery but it does not
take a genius to know that youve been edu-
cated in something else i do not know why
you are masquerading as an oiler you
need not tell me-i fancy father will have
to fire you-then  shall get busy father
has great influence-so have i-with
father

  you neednt the joy of youth and
the riot of living were in his voice she
assured herself he was not much shorter
than other men

  why not

  he paused a minute before answering
and then he seemed to her to stand outside
his own life poking fun at some one else

  i used to live in new york you were
not out in those days and  never happened
to meet your father three years ago 
was engaged to be married

  he expected a protest-but she made no
sign

  do you fuind he asked

  not a bit a man should be a girls first
choice-and a girl a mans last if you want
experienced happiness amaeur heroes
are out of date

  she found his detached attitude infec-
tious-she would have explained avvay a
dozen crimes and gloried in them

  we were going to be married but i

  heard her accidentally sneer at my height
her charming expression was that the pill
was gilded and small enough to be ignored
it really hurt and made me self-conscious
a wave of pity swept over her she had
admired his pluck and happy insouciance
his genial popularity and unwavering gaiety
and imagined that he accepted his lack of
inches without sensitiveness that he had
suffered like this in silence gave her pain

  so i sought for solitude he pointed
round him to the horizon which seemed to
bar them from the world of men i found
it

  she nodded her head in sympathy she
could not speak

  and then you came i went on oiling
theres no gilt edge to that kind of bond-
age

  im proud you did

  thats why i lost myself he answered
as they walked back slowly i wanted to
find some one who would-more than put
up with me

  gale and danvers were sitting on the ve-
randa next morning smoking lazily when
mr hastings suddenly came in sight walk-
ing rapidly he hurried up to the low fence
that surrounded the house and beckoned
them toward him he had taken off his
wide panama hat and stood mopping his
forehead with a big handkerchief his cigar
nestled uninvitingly in the corner of his
mouth a forgotten and chilly derelict

  my god gale he said in a low voice
looking anxiously round a horrible thing
has happened

  gale stood silent waiting his hosts
face was hectic his excitement was painful

  such a thing has never been heard of
up here their value is fabulous-he only
asked for her this morning

  gale deliberately struck a match and of-
fered to relight the dead cigar

  now tell me he said quietly what are
they-who is he and who is she

  mr hastings passed his hand confusedly
over his brow

  life has been going rather quickly for
me this morning he said apologetically
at ten oclock merivale called on me and
asked for leave to marry my daughter and
threatened to fire me if i refused


short stories

  to fire you exclaimed gale and dan-
vers in unison

  yes-he turns out to be the gilbert
merivale who practically controls the stock
of this whole concern he could end my
directorship in three months and hes been
touching his hat to me all these months
there was a twinkle in the old mans eyes
in spite of his anxieties

  and you retain your billet

   had no option and did not want one
rachael has exercised hers

  thats he and she  smiled gale
now what are they

  merivale left the office at eleven-he
was going back to his house to get what he
called an earnest to bind the bargain
five minutes later he telephoned to say the
earnest had vanished earnest indeed
well

  a pearl necklace that belonged to his
mother worth a hundred thousand dollars
a diamond pendant a ring and a pair of
pearl drop ear-rings earnest-good lord
all gone without a trace-stolen-such a
thing up here-horrible-terrible

  wheres merivale snapped out gale
down at his shack i told him to stay
and let nothing be moved

  come gale was already on his way
swinging with quick strides down the vil-
lage mr hastings was spare and active
but he found the pace severe

  merivale was on the veranda waiting
his shack was at the opposite end of the
village to the power house and stood just
where the road up which they had come the
day before began to drop down to the val-
ley there was only one other cottage in
sight of it a hundred yards away

  whose cottage is that asked gale as
he mounted the steps it was characteristic
of him that he offered no congratulations
his mind was absorbed in more imminent
matters weddings could wait

  mrs jones lives there her husband is
an engineer

  the door of merivales shack opened
straight into a big sitting room gale mo-
tioned the others to be seated and stood
with his back to the mantelpiece it was an
unusual room to find in such a place the
whole of the wall that ran from the en-
trance to the kitchen was lined with books

 from floor to ceiling neatly arranged ac-
 cording to size and color it was easy to
 see that the owner loved the bodies as well
 as the souls of his treasures the other
 walls were hung with pictures-a medley
 collection of signed mezzotints and oleo-
 graphs colored horrors from christmas
 magazines and war maps

 jack barnard has an undivided half in-
 terest smiled merivale in apology

 what have you lost asked gale no
 -please dont move till i tell you

 a pearl necklace that belonged to my
 mother

 value

 a hundred thousand dollars merivale
 was still in his oilers working clothes
 what else

 a diamond pendant i had ordered more
 than a week ago for-you know

 gale nodded

 for miss hastings-a ring with a half
 hoop of diamonds and a pair of ear-rings
 with drop pearls

 and they have all vanished gale re-
 frained from questions of worth

 every one-box and all

 gale moved to the seat under the win-
 dow that looked out into the veranda

 where was the box yes-get up and
 show me

 merivale walked toward the kitchen door
 at the back of the room near it was a buf-
 fet let into the wall he pulled open a
 drawer

 i put a box containing them all in here
 just before i went up to see mr hastings at
 ten oclock

 are you sure they were all there
 absolutely

 gale looked thoughtful and his eyebrows
 contracted

 was the box locked

 yes-but not the drawer of course 
 never suspected any trouble

 did you show them to any one

 no

 barnard lives here with you

 yes

 his smile was eloquent of effortless faith
 unconscious of a doubt

 wnen did he go to work

 he left with me and has not yet re-
 turned
unspeakable evidence



  was the back door locked

  yes i had the key in my pocket all the
time  was out

  and the front door

  it shuts automatically mrs ranger is
the only person who has a key besides jack
and me she comes in to clean up

  gale glanced up quickly

  the lady we picked up yesterday
merivale leaned back in his chair and
laughed

  she may steal hearts-but not diamonds
besides shed done her work and gone away
before i did

  honest as the day chimed in mr has-
tings but not popular with the women
her life is hard-dont give them a chance
gale appreciated the whispering gallery of
feminine discontent that might surround
her and determined to weigh well any word
he heard against her he knew that by the
evening no one would be immune from sus-
picion

  he made a tour of the room noting
everything looked at the fastenings of the
windows and searched for finger marks on
the glass suddenly he stopped in his wan-
derings by the bookshelves and dropped on
one knee

  have you been reading pilgrims prog-
ress lately merivale

  danvers smiled to himself at the look of
astonishment on the other mens faces
merivales mouth went into a stern line as
if he deprecated such irrelevant humor he
stood to lose more than a hundred thou-
sand dollars but his mothers necklace
meant more than mere money

  no he answered rather shortly

  gale pointed to the second shelf up a
foot from the floor

  all your other books from floor to ceil-
ing are perfectly straight with the outer
edge of the shelf some of the books in
this row tove been pushed in and recently
for there is no ausy jn tn  inch or two of
shelf that shows

  merivale rose to his feet an d came across
ihe room

  thats strange he said i tk a
tramp abroad from that shelf this morn-
ing looked up a quotation and put it ack
and carefully got all the books in a straight
line at the edge i hate a crinkly row

  and pilgrims progresshas been turned
upside down said gale pointing did
you leave it like that

  not on my oath

  gale took the book out of the shelf and
gazed at it carefully

  i think we had better ask mrs ranger
to come here he said you might ring her
up merivale say nothing about the rest
of us

  within five minutes the door opened and
the widow stood at the entrance framed
like a picture against the dazzling sunlight
she drew back when she saw the four men
gathered as though fearing intrusion but
gale called her in every one stood until
she was seated she gazed round her with
happy astonishment satisfied to live in a
world of men

  mrs ranger said gale do you mind
telling us what you were doing after you
left here this morning

  her lips parted with a faint smile for a
moment she lifted her heavy eyelids and
seemed to focus her far-off thoughts on
human things

is this the catechism taught in england
or the service for those hopelessly at sea
look here mrs ranger merivale
broke in but gale waved him into silence

  please listen to me said gale quietly
something rather awkward has happened
and we want your help

  all right but you are very mysterious
directly i left here at about quarter to ten
i went over to that next cottage belonging
to mrs jones i only left there a few min-
utes ago and went to my own house up the
village

where were you in mrs jones house
i was on the veranda ironing mrs
jones was inside washing the window
was open and we were talking all the time
you can see this house from here
yes

  did you see any one come to this
house

only jack barnard he came in about
half past ten and left again in five minutes
there was a sudden pause and no one
spoke but suspicion was there to be called
groundless

  whats it all about she asked but no
one answered her


short stories

 gale was thinking deeply soon he
 slipped away leaving mrs ranger to the
 valedictory mercies of the other three and
 found his way to mrs jones cottage the
 old lady knew him by sight already and was
 voluble with delight when he praised her
 flowers

 mrs ranger helping you this morning
 he asked pointing to a neat pile of linen
 ay she answered shes a worker

 i thought i saw her up at the post office
 this morning

 no sir we worked together from
 quarter to ten till a few minutes ago then
 i walked up with her to her house and
 came back here she never went to the
 post office  can swear

 talking all the time she was here
 mrs jones placed her fat red arms where
 her waist should have been and smiled

 any one else come along while you
 were working and talking

 no-sir she exclaimed with emphasis
 and was still wondering at gales questions
 long after he had arrived back at the shack
 and reported progress to the other three
 men

 look here said gale to merivale did
 you have any letters from the jewelers
 about these things

 several

 saying when they were coming

 one-a week ago

 and left them lying about
 undoubtedly

 gale walked across once more to the
 book-case

 who teaches school here

 miss hampton

 what are the school hours in the morn-
 ing

 nine to eleven-then a break of ten
 minutes-then on till lunch

 and all children must go

 yes-compelled to by law they come
 from all round-some of them even by
 boats from the homesteads that lie on the
 higher land near the rivers banks

 i should like to see miss hampton-a
 little later

 oh here comes barnard

 the big man glanced inquiringly at the
 crowd

 i say jack exclaimed merivale what

brought you back here in the middle of the
morning

  half an hour off-and a big thirst on
he answered shrugging his shoulders

  the rest of them drifted away-leaving
the two friends alone

  and by lunch time the village buzzed with
the enthusiasm of a first-class mystery

  when lunch was over gale went up to
the school with mr hastings and saw miss
hampton on their return they found dan-
vers watching a game of tennis mr has-
tings had had a gravel court installed-he
nicknamed it the flirtatorium

  merivale obviously holds his friend in-
nocent said gale in a low voice

  the little man and his burly companion
made an odd looking pair they were fight-
ing strenuously against doughty opponents
mrs ranger sat in a deck-chair watching
by her side was rachael wives gossiped
in cliques girls isolated men there was
no dearth of conversation everybody
looked on merivale with awe and on rachael
with affectionate envy from snatches he
overheard gale gathered that no breath of
suspicion had touched barnards name a
pause came in the set after a desperate
game-and a man named steel called out
to barnard for a match

  youll find some loose in the outside
pocket of my coat he answered

  the coat was hanging on a nail fixed into
the uprights that supported the wire netting
around the court

  gale followed steel casually with his eyes
-and saw his brows tighten as he took out
two or three matches he seemed to be
looking steadily at something in his hand
then without waiting he walked across to
merivale who was standing with his back
to him about to serve

  is that one of the jewels you lost meri-
vale

  there was a quick rush of feet across
gravel and a score of people breathless

  steel held out his hand and in the palm
of it lay an ear-ring with a pearl drop

  yes said merivale gravely where did
you find it

  the man looked confused and glanced in-
quiringly at barnard who gave no sign

  in barnards pocket came the slow
reply
unspeakable evidence 



  gale watched the crowd with an in-
voluntary movement as if dreading infec-
tion it swayed away from barnard-and the
silence hurt every vestige of color left
merivales face he looked as if-some one
had convicted him-not barnard-of a
crime no one moved except mrs ranger

   its a plot to ruin you she cried in her
rich deep voice stepping to his side and
looking proudly round for confirmation

  but no one spoke

  barnard seemed dazed-incapable of ac-
tion

  you must come with me barnard said
mr hastings sadly but with the voice of
authority and stay-without your liberty-
till the police arrive

  but  wouldnt prosecute cried meri-
vale sharply

  its bigger than a private wrong-in a
place like this there must be vindication or
punishment-or our security ceases

   the four players put on their coats for-
lornly their game abruptly ended the lit-
tle crowd scattered throbbing with antici-
pation they all liked barnard but excite-
ment in the village was rare the day
seemed to compensate for months of dull-
ness

  mr hastings and jack barnard walked
away in silence together gale and dan-
vers went up the hill past the big dam
found a boat and rowed up the river

   they returned later in the afternoon and
gale hurried to mr hastings study

  well said the director wearily so
i need not have troubled you after all its
all come out by itself

  has it asked gale

  what do you mean

   i want you to start an authoritative ru-
mor that you are going to raise the river
evel to-morrow that extra ten feet

  mr hastings put down the cigar he was
smoking ifod stood up

   what he askeu avrsdulously

   you need not really do it--but the rumor
must start and see that every one hears it
-but dont say a word till after drk then
at midnight when the night shifts are all on
duty and there is no one wandering about
the village i will get you and merivale 
come on a little expedition with danv ers
and myself blankets will be desirable

  what on earth are you driving at
forgive me if i tell you no more at
present i do not want to raise a suspicion
in your mind against any one-i want to
catch them with the goods

  by midnight the village was still the
lights were brilliant in the power house
showing the sleepless watchers keeping un-
ending vigil that distant cities might slum-
ber in safety but everywhere else silence
reigned the little party of four left the
house at varying intervals that no late strag-
gler might mark them and after unob-
trusive wayfaring foregathered at a spot
beyond the big dam by the waters edge
a lantern was lighted and they marched
steadily through the low-lying mist along a
forest trail close to the rivers bank not a
sound reached their ears but the protesting
ooze of the wet ground as they hastened
forward and the liquid note of a distant owl
twenty minutes brought them to an old dis-
used log cabin-standing back a few yards
from the river the owner had left it to
fester by the side of the stagnant water
when the land he had laboriously cleared of
timber had sunk forever beneath the rising
tide

  we stay here till dawn said gale
pushing open the rotting door we must
make ourselves as warm and as dry as we
can we collected some wood this after-
noon lets make a fire

  they gathered round the hearth and de-
termined to be merry but the dank solitude
was oppressive the fog outside and the
reeking moisture of the walls inside
weighed on their spirits in spite of well-
meant efforts

  what are we doing asked mr has-
tings at last every minute he had been ex-
pecting gale to explain this mysterious and
uncomfortable outing and at length he felt
he could bear ignorance no longer

  gale looked up at him with a smile that
was half an apology

  have patience with me till the dawn
he pleaded

  at the first glimmer of morning gale
opened the door and called the others they
stood on the edge of a great back water
lazily lapping the half-drowned trunks of
endless trees three hundred yards away in
the leafy distance was the main stream gray


short stories

and lifeless in the early light a boat lay
moored beneath them gale pointed to her
and they clambered in danvers took the
oars and pushed and paddled as best he
could forcing a way through standing tim-
ber and floating logs a little way before
they reached the main stream they came to
a barn half submerged surrounded by
cedars except on the side where it faced the
river danvers guided the boat in through
the opening where the doors had been
just above their heads were the wooden
beams which had formed the ceiling of the
barn near the entrance was a trap-door
gale opened it and drew himself up into the
loft and bade mr hastings follow him the
other two men drifted off in the boat to hide
nearby

  this unfortunate homesteader had pre-
pared for the winter just before you
drowned him out said gale

  the floor of the loft was stacked with
logs split for firewood-running in a double
rampart five feet high right across from
one sloping eave to the other

  hastings looked round the place in mute
astonishment event had followed event
rather dizzily and he scarcely knew where
the normal ended and the surprising began
the pale morning light came in wearily
through a hole in the end of the building
that had once been a window

  look here mr hastings said gale i
believe the jewels are hidden somewhere in
this loft i have had no time to search as
yet-i do not expect to have time now be-
sides i want to find the thief not merely
the treasure im going on the other side
of those logs you will stay here please on
this side in the far corner facing the trap
door there is an old barrel there and some
boughs that will serve as a screen

  but to what end

  hush whispered gale hastily be
quick and get to cover

  far away came the faint whisper of a
sound-only audible because it was regular
and repeated it crept into a greater
rhythm the girding of wood against wood
and the indrawn whistle of water cut
sharply gale could almost feel the ap-
proach of a canadian canoe paddled by an
expert hand he crawled over the logs and
crouched behind them holding his breath

as he heard a boat float into the lower part
of the barn and the person in charge making
her fast mr hastings stole behind his
barrel and branches and longed to call out
to gale but refrained he had already suf-
fered from the cold and chill of the night
but his blood nearly froze as he saw the trap
door slowly very slowly rising up gale
could only listen he could not see but
he was conscious of a human being moving
across the floor toward him then a voice
began counting from the left-hand end of
the logs one-two-three and so on up to
twenty-seven

  a sudden movement showed him where a
log in the front pile must have been touched
very quietly and without a sound he
started to withdraw the corresponding log in
the back pile

  he waited a second or two fearful lest
he might be seen if the stealthy visitant
were glancing through the hole then very
carefully he lowered his head there was a
tunnel right through to the other side
half way a sponge-bag was lying and work-
ing its way steadily toward it was an arm
gale pushed his own hand through his end
of the opening and as the unknown hand
touched the bag he seized it with an iron
grip a startled shriek of terror rang out
and gale still grasping the hand put his
head up over the top of the barrier on the
other side dumb with horror her wild black
eyes wide open for once as if fearing some
hideous apparition from the unseen world
was mrs ranger her lips colorless and sag-
ging her face a leaden gray mr hastings
sprang out from his hiding place and dashed
across to her as she struggled to free her
hand half standing half kneeling on the
wet and slippery floor

  dont let her escape cried gale he
let her hand go-but retained the bag sb
rose to her feet and leaned against thrc pile
of wood for support gale btev a whistle
and danvers and merivale rowed up to the
barn and climb ed into the loft

  are thes-e your jewels asked gale as
he undid tne bag and drew out a pearl neck-
lace and a diamond pendant a half hoop of
diamonds and one pearl ear-ring

   yes came the answer without hesita-
tion this ear-ring matches the one found
in jack barnards pocket
unspeakable evidence



  the four men turned and faced the wo-
man-but she gave no sign her arms were
on the top of the woodpile her face hidden
her body shaken with sobs

  gale touched her gently on the shoulder
and pointed to the trap-door danvers
helped her into the boat-and without an-
other word they started on their homeward
way towing the canoe behind them

  a police sergeant arrived last night
said mr hastings quietly to gale as they
reached the shore we had better wake
him-and-he glanced round to make
sure he was out of earshot effect a change
of prisoners

  the truth the whole truth and nothing
but the truth mr gale the first moment
youre not hungry rachael smiled her
command from behind her coffee pot gale
glanced round the breakfast table and saw
the eager faces bent on him

  do you remember the book that was up-
side down he said turning to merivale
that was what started me you went out
at ten and the jewels were safe you re-
turned at eleven and the jewels had van-
ished the back door was locked you had
the key-the front door would only open
to you-or barnard or mrs ranger
what about the windows asked
rachael

  i looked at them they are all high up
from the ground except the one from the
veranda and that only opened from the top
-and then only half way

  quite right said barnard we fixed
that on purpose to prevent temptation

   was sure continued gale the en-
trance was effected through the door now
it was either barnard who admittedly was
there or else mrs rangers key was used
but she was in mrs jones veranda all
the time

  i knew and but for one circumstance i
agree that things would have looked bad
against you barnard

  what was it

  all along the wall from the door to the
buffet where the jewels were put avay were
the book-shelves some of the books had
been pushed back on the shelf two feet from
the ground and one of them was upside
down and-sticky barnard is well over

six feet and if intent on crime would not
stoop down to play with books a sticky
book two feet from the ground suggests a
loitering child if the book contains pic-
tures the presumption becomes much
stronger

  thank the lord ejaculated barnard
and every one smiled

  now who sent the child not barnard
for he came himself the only other per-
son who has a key is mrs ranger she
was on mrs jones veranda all the morn-
ing she did not come herself she sent
the child

  but all the children are in school at
that time exclaimed rachael

  precisely-and that is where her abnor-
mal cunning comes in-no ordinary child
was available a conversation with any
ordinary child mrs jones would have over-
heard-once the theft became known an
ordinary child would talk the only child
that would suit mrs rangers purpose
would be one who through some infirmity
did not go to school-one who could not
talk so that mrs jones would notice her-
one who could not overhear any subsequent
gossip about the crime

  a deaf and dumb child little elsie
atkinson cried merivale gale nodded

  such a child is cut off from gossip peo-
ple only trouble to convey her elementary
facts i found out from the school teacher
that there was a deaf and dumb child who
lives away on the hill side who comes in
twice a week regularly to the store yes-
terday was one of her days i went to see
her in the afternoon and talked to her on
my fingers she was perfectly frank and
perfectly innocent she had come to the
store then sought out mrs ranger the one
person in the village who can talk the deaf
and dumb alphabet according to her usual
custom for the pleasure of a chat mrs
ranger was on the veranda gave her the
key and told her on her fingers to go to the
other shack and fetch a box she would find
in the drawer the child never opened the
box but merely did as she was told she
admitted to pilgrims progress and hands
sticky with candy

  but how did mrs ranger plan it
asked barnard slow and cautious in his
reasoning


short stories

  she saw the letters saying the jewels
were coining she saw the box containing
them she knew that little elsie would come
in that morning and she deliberately
planned her clever coup

  but how did you spot the barn asked
hastings who was still somewhat inclined
to shiver

  if we had charged her on elsies state-
ment she would have laughed and pro-
duced some other box-saying that was the
one the child fetched it was essential to
find the merry widow handling her booty
now in a village this size concealment is
difficult-the guilty mind of an amateur
always expects a search and nervously
imagines that every wall is transparent
digging would attract attention the natu-
ral result is an obscure and unusual hiding
place all the time that i was voyaging up
and down the river the first day i was here
i was saying to myself what an ideal place
any of these half-submerged huts would be
for the concealment of a crime i knew she
was an ardent fisherman and could go on
the river without attracting attention the
conclusion was obvious that she would

choose a shack-the first convenient shack
well hidden from the village after dan-
vers and i had talked to the child we rowed
up the river prospecting we found the
barn almost hidden by trees the trap door
had been opened recently

  but the ear-ring in my pocket cried
barnard

  gale looked at merivale and then at
rachael and guessed that their happiness
meant sorrow for barnard

  thou art blind as a bat jack merivale
broke in helpingly honest now has mrs
ranger never suggested to you that you
and she were made for each other the
big engineer actually blushed and hung his
head

  at the dance he murmured she drew
a blank

  she wanted wealth-she wanted im-
munity-she wanted revenge smiled meri-
vale in reply a triple alliance of blessings
she all but achieved standing up for you
in the tennis court was part of her plot you
had better thank your deliverer

  im grateful said barnard stretching
out a hand to gale

  the inherited animal

  by c wells ni em an
  author of bashfords try out the go-devil etc

          a boston love affair a wild west i-iold-up and
          an oil fields reception all get mixed up in one
          beautiful soul-satisfying scrap neiman is back
          with another hon est-to-blazes oil fields story

you hear plenty these days
about brute force and i reckon
the folks that claim its no use
to anybody but mules and
steam engines are playing safe
in the long run but life-anyway down
here in the california oil fields-isnt all
long run and its those short quick sprints
that are liable to make all the difference i
got in mind the time henry adams came
down to our midway camp fresh out of
harvard and looking for a chance to see
life and though of course henry didnt
drift in as any bright shining example of
brute force circumstances sort of put it
onto him-circumstances and the inherited
animal

  the first time i ever uncorked an eye on
henry was one day when i noticed a
stnrnger talking to the bartender at the
last chae i was boss of the inspection
crew that went th raunds of the companys
camps blowing out the producing wells and
looking after the casing and keeping things
generally at top notch and i didnt get
around to oil strata oftener than every six
months so there are always plenty of peo-
ple i dont know in town but henry
wasnt that kind of stranger he was a
stranger to the whole oil country the kina

the dogs in a camp bark at just because they
dont understand him

  however  may as well say so the spe-
cial reason for my trip at this particular
time was not to my liking at all beings how
it was a sort of a half-baked detective job

  it was all on account of a hold-up job per-
petrated on our general paymaster charlie
chiswel a couple of weeks ago youve
heard of him-the boys used to call him
charley coldchisel because he was so all-
fired sharp and had such a way of driving
himself into things this holdup was the
first and only time charley ever had it put
over him i reckon and then a gang
held him up in his office at the flowing for-
tune and got away with a payroll the size
of a yellow dog he carried a forget-me-not
of that pleasant occasion in the shape of a
red gash over one eye that he claimed
wouldnt ever heal up till hed landed the
gang in a safe-deposit vault

  now my pleasant job on my rounds this
time was to seek out and report to this cold-
chisel person any suspects disguised as hon-
est workingmen nice job for an oil-well
inspector-not

  say sam the bartender calls out to
me heres somebody you ought to know
shake hands with mr adams fresh off the

us


short stories

ice from boston mass and by the wink
he gave i knew hed been stuffing the young
fellow with more than whisky the way some
people do thinking it funny business to lie
blue blazes to a greenhorn and get him to
believe anything you can get him to believe

  glad to know you mr adams i says
holding out my hand i suppose youre
making a tour of the fields here and i hope
youll be favorably impressed with what
you see

  im one of the old timers and ive never
got round to shake the habit of being polite
to strangers from the east for in the early
days the very breath in our vests depended
on those fellows-and the little round toys
they brought in their pockets and even
though this one didnt look like cash in the
bank wearing dirty overalls and a flannel
shirt and all the trimmings of a working
man id been used to seeing investors tog
up that way thinking it was the costume of
the country-one of em even had on a
cowboy outfit once spurs chaps and gun
complete and just missed being strung up
for a bad man on sight but he went away
leaving about a quarter million souvenirs
with us so we learned that appearances are
sometimes pleasantly deceiving

  i am pleased to meet you henry an-
swers but i mustnt allow you to take me
for a tourist i work at the midway field as
a roustabout

  huh i grunts too surprised to do any-
thing but believe him you from the east
and working is it a bet or something
no he says im out here to learn
what they couldnt teach me at harvard-
knowledge of my fellow men and the best
way i can acquire that is by mingling with
them and working as one of them

  well i says i dont get the hang of
your idea though maybe its all right but
if youre hired at the midway youll be on
my gang to-morrow so you might as well
come out with me now im on my way and
theres a seat in the buggy that aint work-
ing id like to hear more about this clas-
sical theory of yours

  but i came in with the skinner he ob-
jects and was going back with him to-
night

  dont you worry butts in the bar-
keeper hell be too drunk to notice

whether hes got six mules with him or

seven

  i dont like that kind of smart aleck talk
-repartee they call it in the dime novels-
so i gave the barkeep the disgusted glance
and shoved henry out of the place and into
my buggy

  henry was the most enthusiastic student
of real life id ever laid ear to he just
bubbled with talk all the way out to camp
and was so pleased at having somebody wil-
ling to listen to him he told me pretty much
everything there was to tell about himself
and what he didnt say then came out later
it seems that one of henrys ancestors so
he said had rowed no  on the crew that
brought the mayflower into american poli-
tics and the familyd lived in boston ever
since the boat docked without hardly set-
ting their patent leathers outside the city
limits that kind of exclusive life had
made em grow shells on themselves like
turtles and got em so they didnt care to
associate with anybody who wasnt the
same kind of turtle they always went to
harvard and took all the degrees on the
list and then came out and worked at jobs
in lawyers offices and banks and brokers
places and that sort of literary business

  hed started through the same mill and
been tied up in a stall in that big education
menagerie and fed wisdom straight from
the original bucket for seven years till he
had more initials behind his name than in
front but somewhere in his backbone
there must have been one of those little
animals that made his mayflower ancestors
restless enough to come over in the first
place and he hadnt been willing to settle
down in his shell without first having a try
and a shy at the territory outside boston
anythings liable to happen once you get a
few red corpuscles contaminating real blue
blood

  he was tall and black-haired and kind of
thin especially round the lvwer part of his
face and he hacj eyes that looked as if there
wasnt ever  dream very far from them
he appeared about as much like a roust-
about as a gilt-edged dictionary in six vol-
umes looks like a cookbook but he was
having a grand old time wearing overalls
anj bunking in with his fellow-humans and
i reckon he was as he said learning some-
the inherited animal



thing he couldnt have got any other way
all that worried him was that his people
might hear what he was up to-or down to
as theyd have put it-in which case theyd
have fainted and the family couldnt have
held up its head for two generations and
the rest of the turtles would have excluded
them from their exclusiveness and thered
have been dignified hell to pay of course
they knew he was in california and that
was some scandal itself but his mail was
taken care of by a clerk in a hotel at los
angeles and hed done all he could so as
not to have his crime detected

  i guess i get you henry i says after
hed told me this far and your scheme
aint so bad but for a man that wants to
study human nature right where its human-
est and most natural  wouldnt exactly
recommend the midway as a place to catch
life hot off the bat its nothing now but a
pumping camp

  why he says it appears to me like an
exceedingly live place was it ever any
different

  ever different i turns on him why
the place looks as if the clock had been
wound up and the cat put out and the cellar
door slammed to and bolted the spirits
gone-the feeling that youre chasing some-
thing andll catch it around the next corner
-the rainbow thats humping itself over
camp and liable to explode and drown you
in diamonds you ought to have seen the
place when the prospecting was on and the
drilling crews swarming over the landscape
and the whole camp crawling with excite-
ment once you find your oil the sun dont
rise the same over any camp it quits work
and settles down like a man thats had
money left him and the boys-the real
boys that a man wants to travel with-drift
away to some new camp and theres nobody
left but a lot of lazy tikes hanging around
the engvjie house without enough to do to
keep em heaifty

  tell me asks heilfy iis eyes shining
and the blood working up into his narrow
cheek bones are there any camps left
where they havent found the oil yt-t
theyre few and scarce i answers
and youd best not look for em i like
your spirit though henry theres no our-
flush about your ideas of educating your-

self but one thing i want to ask you since
youve been so free to tell me what you
have are you doing all this overall stunt
just for the simple-pure cause of the higher
learning

  of course he answers but theres a
little something shaky in his voice what
else-why should i be here if it werent for
that

  oh for nothing else i agrees as cheer-
ful as if i believed him only ive always
noticed that when a man especially a fel-
low thats been brought up the way you
have does something different from any-
thing hes ever done before its because-
well theres always a woman somewhere in
the story

  the way his face started to imitate the
rising sun i knew id won a cigar on that
shot and after about a mile of painful si-
lence he came through with it she was a
real boston girl i gathered anyway she
had a regular puritan brand baked beans
name priscilla hancock and shed led such
a sheltered exclusive life her folks wouldnt
let her know that the u s had ever ad-
mitted any other states to associate with the
original thirteen shed gone through the
female annex of the same mill as henry
and theyd been engaged to be married dur-
ing cradle days but just lately something
had gone wrong shed got tired of him
he thought maybe because she decided to
call off the matrimonial probabilities and
play a lone hand in the game of life henry
couldnt understand it at all said that sort
of thing wasnt done in boston and had
been so broken up he didnt want to see
that part of the country for a while but
after hed been talking a while i began to
get an idea about that girl

  henry i says ive got about one
per cent of one per cent as much educa-
tion as you but i know whats the trouble
with your girl its the inherited animal in
her

  what do you mean asks henry
what animals that

  first cousin to your own i answers
inherited straight from the pilgrims or the
puritans or the plymouth rocks or what-
ever it was your ancestors called them-
selves

  more than that i wouldnt tell him


short stories

though the thing stood pretty clear in my
mind she was a high-spirited girl and
had too much natural push to be satisfied
with any man raised entirely on boston tea
and harvard toast i hoped that if there
was anything to the fellow except intellect
the fields would bring it out anyway he
was pointed right

  for all of henrys education he was more
of a fool in some things than the average
man that ran away from home at the age of
eight and absorbed his learning from the
remarks of a sea-captain it seems that his
particular pal at camp was a fellow named
a christian who henry thought was one
big treat in the line of humanity a simple
straightforward gentleman in overalls with
ideas and ideals and a love of his fellow
creatures that made a red cross nurse look
like a cat with her back up id never
wasted eyesight on the man before but the
minute i saw him i knew he was wrong-
so crooked hed make a corkscrew look like
the shortest distance between two points
it was a wonder bashford the time-keeper
at the midway had ever taken him on but
bashfords got lots to learn that way too
i decided not to say anything to henry for
one reason because i wanted to watch this
natures nobleman on the quiet and head
him off if he tried to do the company any
dirt anyway henry was in for education
and ought to be let get it even if something
dropped on him hed been taught too
much already-it was time now for him to
learn something

  when my crew got in next day things
began to jump along in the regulation way
and i was too busy to pay attention to any-
thing but cleaning wells mike donlin
always went a day or so ahead of me and
got things started he was a red-haired
irishman with a temper as short and the
same color as his hair and he had a red-
headed way of introducing himself to those
pump-tenders and engine-feeders that con-
vinced em wed arrived and their vacation
was over he didnt always get into a fight
but was always willing to and his face was
like one of those billboards along the rail-
road with a big sign on it that says try it
once

  we were just starting to pull casing on
no  when to make matters interesting

mr henderson showed up as a visitor
that general superintendent of ours is
about as welcome as a gila monster in your
bed my idea of heaven is to see mr hen-
derson stroll into an oil camp cool and smil-
ing and cheerful hand cigars around and
say hello boys everything going fine
i see well dont overwork because the
companys pretty well satisfied with things
as they are

  and my idea of the other place is the way
he does it in real life

  as if he wouldnt have been enough all
alone he had a telegram in his hand it
was from the old man himself and read

    arrive to-morrow arrange to enter-
  tain party including ladies

  entertain em he yells at bashford
what does he think we run here-open-air
vaudeville were fixed fine to entertain
party including ladies

  thats easy i puts in well take em
out and have a picnic supper in the grove
huh he roars grove and he and
bashford looked around that desert wild-
eyed and searching as if maybe there might
be a tree theyd overlooked heretofore

  sure i goes on and then well have a
bathing party on the beach and take em for

an aeroplane ride-

  go to hell he bellows and turns on his
heel so hard he nearly went twice around

  well an oil camp is a great place to in-
vite ladies to theres so much to see and if
they look slow and take in all the details
that entertainmentll last five good minutes
after that its about as interesting as a visit
to your grandfathers cousin in the old
soldiers home as a matter of fact i had
a good deal more license to be worried than
anybody else for i could see it coming as
plain as the curl in a pigs tail how that
entertaining was going to be all on me the
men in the party would get together in the
office with mr henderson -dnd bashford
and open a bottlft yellowstone and set-
tle down to talk the business theyd come
out to talk eaving me under orders to show
the ladies around they werent due till
next day but i began getting blue over the
situation right away-and then suddenly i
rem embers henry adams

  if any man could be spared off a crew it
the inherited animal



was that student of real life and with his
education and general finish he was just
pointed at by the finger of destiny to enter-
tain that party id make him put on civil-
ized clothes and wash the oil out of his feat-
ures and talk boston to those ladies 
thought hed be glad of the chance to min-
gle once again with his kind but he wasnt
it turned out when  gave him the order
claimed he hadnt come out here for that
and how he was in a condition of spiritual
detachment from his world which couldnt
be interfered with and would have gone on
some more but mike donlin shut him up

  ye can cut the chinase jabber young
feller he yells an opin yer eyes to the
bosss orders tay parties or murdher tis
all one to ye whin yere told to do a
thing-

  its all right mike i breaks in you
seem to have let the light of reason into
him and hell show up on schedule fixed for
entertaining and henry i calls after
him if youve got a dress-suit with you
put it on well show em we know whats
what in midway

  it was about nine oclock the next day
when mr buskirk and his party came down
the road there were two big automobiles
of party and they piled out in front of the
office till it looked as if the landscape
wasnt going to hold em all hed brought
his son van and crocker one of the big
engines of the s p railroad and a couple
of other men who looked able to take care
of themselves and a young fellow of about
henry adams general style and makeup
-and of all the men in the world i did not
want to see-charley chiswell mr bus-
kirk hadnt raised any false alarm about the
ladies there were four of em vans wife
and crockers and his daughter-regular
california people at home wherever you
put em-and a tall girl very dignified the
kind thtt ought to be on a marble post in the
rotunda of thf state capitol pretty enough
as a work of art but too old in the eyes
for a real girl

  after the first how-do-you-dos all around
mr buskirk hooked me off to one side and
gave the word of course i didnt raise any
objections just grinned as if id been lying
awake over night hoping to be askej to
show the ladies something in a place wl iere

there wasnt anything to see then i
whistled for henry as a matter of fact
i wouldnt have minded the job so much if
it had just been vans wife and the crock-
ers for anybodyd feel at home with them
and glad to be there but the fellow-lionel
frost was the name his folks had embroid-
ered onto him-was going along with us
and the tall girl too and i didnt feel quite
up to em she made a kind of try at being
friendly but she was no mixer and right
from the start as much out of the game as
a one-legged veteran at a country dance
id no more think of talking to her than i
would of asking the preacher to go fishing
on sunday i was mighty glad id fixed it
for henry to set up his derrick on the job
i looked all round to give him the high
sign but somehow hed got out of sight
which was funny for id seen him hovering
around in the dim distance when the party
came that made me pretty mad and i
called mike over and told him to go fetch
the young fellow

  i looked to see him show up about twelve
and a half seconds later but instead mike
came back looking mighty puzzled and
whispered that henry wanted to see me
bad-something important you bet that
didnt make me feel any better having to
play nurse to that fellows educated scru-
ples but i reckoned i better see what he
wanted so i set em all to counting how
many strokes a minute one of the pumps
was making-which shows you how i was
put to it for entertaining-and made for the
bunk-house henry was standing back of
the door looking through the crack he had
pulled off his good clothes-he hadnt put
on the dress-suit as i told him to anyway-
and was in his overalls and flannel shirt
again and he had his felt hat pulled down
over his forehead like a moving picture
train robber

  what the devil i starts why arent
you out on the job

  i cant he answers looking scared and
helpless shes there

  she who i asks theres four of
em

  shes there he says again sort of
gaspy priscilla hancock the one i told
you about

  well if shes a friend of yours- i


short stories

says trying to remember what hed told me

  shes my fiancee he answers were
betrothed she mustnt see me here

  if you mean by that youre going to
marry her some day  says whats the
harm in her seeing you here then i re-
members about the boston turtles well
i says giving in i reckon youre let out
then but hows it happen shes down here
in midway its some ways from home for
her

  shes been visiting bess crocker in los
angeles he answers they went through
vassar together i suppose she asked her
to come down here with them what a rot-
ten coincidence-what a damn rotten coin-
cidence it doesnt seem possible

  coincidences happen i remarks to
boston people same as to real folks but i
got to get back to em now and if they want
to see the inside of this bunk-house you get
under a bunk

  i started off to my crowd again but i
never finished that days entertaining not
in the way youd call entertaining that is
id not more than set my foot outside the
bunk-house when one of the boys on my
crew jess the carpenter a little wiry fellow
mighty good at his job but apt to go off the
handle when things happened he hadnt cal-
culated on came running up hed been
looking all over camp for me scared and
jumpy as a calf hunting its mother

  sam he calls out whatre we going
to do no  derricks started to fall and
we cant hold her

  i didnt blame no  much for starting to
fall because theyd pulled up about three
hundred feet of steel casing and leaned it
against that derrick and i wasnt pleased
with jess for losing his head that way over
the proposition no  is about half a mile
from camp the other side of a little hill
and i found my crew running around like
ants with their hill kicked up and the der-
rick in a bad way leaning over as if it had
got tired of life and wanted to lay down
all that kept it from doing that was a rope
jess had made fast near the top and carried
over to a pumping-jack and so far it was
all right only when the crew began haul-
ing on that rope to right the derrick the
casing got jammed into the crossbeams and
couldnt be budged if they pulled any

more the crossbeams might tear loose and
let the casing right through the whole side
it was a kind of ticklish job but a little pa-
tience and not getting excited was all it
needed i had em make a line fast to each
length of casing and pull it away from the
crossbeams one at a time then i buried a
dead-man and rigged up a block and tackle
and she went back nice and easy straight
and pert as when she was born

  there wasnt really any trouble at all
about that job but it took about two hours
-and great jack-rabbits id forgotten clean
utterly about those ladies if theyd been
entertaining themselves all this time with
counting pump-strokes my respect for their
intellgence was as small as a horn-toads
ears

  it took about three jumps to get me to the
top of the hill where i could see camp
again there wasnt a sign of ladies or any-
body else moving the office door and win-
dows were wide open and i could hear the
tail end of a cuss word floating out so i
knew they hadnt been invited to join the
discussion then i noticed that where the
automobiles had been standing in the shade
of the mule shed there was only one left
and suddenly i saw henry adams coming
out of the engine house as independent and
careless about being seen as the only
rooster in a henyard

  see here henry i comes up to him
with whats the meaning of this wheres
my party and whats happened to the other
auto

  its all right mr carruthers he an-
swers i arranged matters in your absence
so as to relieve you of further care

  what in blazes do you mean i asks
and who gave you license to arrange mat-
ters anyway

  why he says you appeared to be
detained by matters of importance and
christian very kindly offered to sh your
guests around the country tney took one
of the cars and a chauffeur and theyve
been gone about half an hour now wasnt
that all right theyll enjoy them-
selves-

  i caught him by his lanky shoulders and
yanked his face up close

  henry adams youre a fool and a damn
fool and a double-damn fool i yells at
the inherited animal



him but you get busy now and answer me
some questions who all went in that auto-
mobile

  why there were the women of course
he answers and lionel frost-hes a
cousin of miss hancocks and a junior at
harvard-and christian and the chauf-
feur-

  which chauffeur i rips out

  the short one the chap with the little

round head-

  with the cauliflower ear and the stone-
bruise on his cheek

   wasnt near enough to notice henry
answers but he seemed to know christian

-i suppose theyd met before-

  yes i reckon theyve met before all
right i remarks anybody else

  just before they started christian went
over to no  well and came back with fred
turner and squeezed him into the front

  turner i yells ive had my sus-
picions of him too now i know-

  but whats the matter henry asks
scared without knowing why did i do
wrong

  you did a plenty i says thinking at the
rate of two hundred a minute then i told
him what i thought of christian and what i
thought of henry adams too for letting a
crowd like that get hold of those women and
ride off with em in an automobile

  i tell you he looked pretty sick before
id got done barking at him and then his
jaw set hard with his thin lips shut together
in a straight black line and the dream in his
eyes turned white hot with the fire just
spitting out

  kidnapped he shouts my god such
a thing happening to priscilla he stood
in his tracks a second and then he turned as
if hed been hit and broke for the auto-
mobile standing by the mule shed

  kidnapped be damned this heres real
trouble here where you going i yells
at his back

  going to follow em he snaps without
stopping to look around

  the chauffeur wasnt in the auto and i
was looking this way and that for hiifl but
henry didnt wait for anybody he jumped
into that wagon and began jabbing ind
poking at things and yanking levers around

and before  could get to him he had the
things going with a noise like a barrel of
stones rolling downhill i swear he didnt
seem to care whether i went along with him
or not and i dont know that he even no-
ticed id climbed into the back seat

  wait i yells we cant do this alone
weve got to get help

  help be damned he answers

  but maybe they got guns i protests

  guns be damned he says hauling over
the wheel and making that auto waltz on its
two hind legs

  the fool would have started off by him-
self after three men maybe gunned to the
limit and id have gone along with him
unless i choked him first but just at that
minute around the corner of the mule-shed
came mike donlin i yelled to him to jump
in but he stood there like a fool not seem-
ing to get onto what i wanted there
wasnt any time to stop and explain so i
just leans way out and yells come on
fight and that red irish head made a dive
through the air like a comet stung by a wasp
and landed all over that back seat and
me too

  out across the desert henry swung fol-
lowing the tracks of that other auto and
pretty soon we branched off to the east and
were streaking along the old road to the
last dollar camp anyway we were hit-
ting parts of the road the parts a little
nearer heaven than the majority for never
yet did i see a man run an auto like henry
turns in the road didnt mean anything to
him hed cut across lots scaling the hills
and dropping down the other side one place
we came to was an arroyo about ten feet
wide and half a dozen deep and we could
see where the other auto had made consid-
erable of a run-about to dodge it but henry
didnt have the dodge idea in him he just
yanked the jump lever or something and
that machine lifted its front legs up and
struck out with its hind ones and we hit the
ground so far the other side of the arroyo
we never saw it you dont have to be-
lieve me unless you want to for maybe my
ideas of that ride got kind of mixed mike
and i were doing our best to hang on to
something but everything we laid hold of
kicked us loose again and wed land way
over somewhere else pretty soon all we


short stories

could keep a grip on was each other and
anybody to see us would have thought we
were having the savagest kind of a wrest-
ling match with all rules suspended

  but you cant eat up road like that with-
out getting somewhere and pretty soon i
made out to brace my teeth with my tongue
so they wouldnt get blown down my wind-
pipe and steadied myself by one of henrys
ears

  pull her up i yells i got an idea
and after pretty near strangling him the
machine slowed down to a trot right the
other side of this hill were coming to i
says is a kind of valley well get out
here and sneak up to the top and maybe we
can see em without giving ourselves away
just yet

  even henry could get the sense of that so
we left the auto and snaked it on our vests
over to the top of the hill right below us
was the last dollar and we could see all
over that deserted camp the company had
blown up two y-ars before and everything
had been left standing right where it was
there were a couple of derricks and a
bunk-house and an old lean-to without any-
thing to lean against-just the corpse of a
camp the place was but what took our eye
was the auto wed been trailing there she
was standing right in front of the bunk-
house something appeared to have gone
wrong for all our people were out walking
around looking at it except the chauffeur
and christian and turner who were fooling
with one of the wheels henry was for
walking right down and asking the ladies to
step into our auto thinking the fellows
would be too scared to put up a fight it
looked as easy to him as stealing a girl at a
dance away from some patent leather willie
without the spunk of a wilted shirt-front
mike was for tearing down on em swing-
ing our fists and yelling the battle cry of
county cork and willing to do the trick all
by himself while we watched him but i
was boss of that crew for which all hands
can be mighty thankful

  i felt pretty sure those tough-faced lads
were up to something crooked but to make
our job good and complete we ought to wait
till we could get some evidence to lay
against them my plan was to slide down
among the sagebrush and through an old

pipe trench i knew about up to one corner
of the bunk-house where wed be close
enough to hear anything they said also be
in shape to put a kink in anything they
started the scheme tickled henry for it
looked like a larger dose of real life than
hed ever moren read about but it didnt
set well with mike for he was afraid maybe
we couldnt get anything on those boys and
there wouldnt be any fight after all

  it was fine sport crawling through that
brush a regular appetite-sprouter where
there wasnt enough brush wed burrow
through the sand like gophers and little
pebbles used to get started in around
my collar and work clear down to my boots
scratching every inch at the last we made
a doubled-up run and reached the corner
with nobody wiser from there we had a
pretty good chance to see what was going
on because that old house was so full of
holes it would hardly stand anyway the
auto had cast a shoe in the off hind tire and
theyd had to put on a new one it appeared
the way theyve got autos down to-day all
a man has to do to change a tire is to get out
and swear at it but in those days it wasnt
so easy the tire on that car must have
given em a good deal of trouble and used
up lots of time to judge by the tools lying
around and the sweaty temper those fel-
lows were in but they had it all fixed
when we got there and were in a piling
hustle to get started again and the ladies
including that frost cousin of miss han-
cocks whod been gently mooning around
over the scenery seeing that things were
ready sauntered up and began climbing in
mrs crocker had the door open and was
putting her foot on the stepping-board when
that christian insolently laid hold of her
arm

  say maam he comes out with weve
got something to tell you and we aim to tell
it now you folks aint going to cc onto
this car

  we aint snaps back mrs crocker
whosays so and what are you up to
anyway

  me and my friends here answers
chrifaian in one of those gruff voices that
blo straight off a sandpaper disposition
have concluded to leave this part of the
country and we got to have the wagon here
the inherited animal



to use in our travels you ladies are goin
to walk back to camp-

  walk back to camp shrieks mrs
crocker and then there broke loose the
darnedest female commotion ever  hope to
see and come through alive crockers wife
and vans wife and bess crocker too just
lit into those fellows for all their tongues
and lungs were worth they took turns tell-
ing em what they thought of em only their
turns all came at the same time which made
it trying on the ears even miss hancock
must have said something for i saw her
mouth going through the motions but her
remarks got lost in the general conversa-
tion i wouldnt be a bit surprised if theyd
have talked those nervy villains clear off
their feet given time but it had got to the
point now where it was up to us to mix a
little action into the scene

  id been having my hands full holding
mike in and when  gave him the sign he
was off and around the corner of that shack
like a greased pig struck by lightning i
was right after him of course but i only
got there in time to catch a birds-eye wink
of christian walking backward with his
chin up in the air and his hands trying to
grab the clouds and mike getting ready for
another swing then i saw that chauffeur
yanking and hauling at his rear pocket and
i closed on him from in back holding down
his arms and trying to ram in his backbone
with my knee it was mighty unhandy and
he squirmed and wriggled like a coyote
caught by the tail all the time trying to out
with the gun or put it in action through his
pocket

   as we whirled round i got a glint of hen-
ry adams and turner squaring off at each
other and at the next whirl they were lay-
ing into themselves in a mix-up of arms and
legs that looked like a dozen apiece then
my lad made out to jerk his gun loose and
i was back again to the matter in hand
once he fired and i found later some pow-
der marks on my right leg and a black
streak that might have been the graze of
the lead next minute i landf-d a knee-
kick that caught that gun just rigijt and it
sailed a dozen feet off but that sfcot had
made me crazy killing mad i dropped the
fellows arms and got a clinch round his
neck and hugged till my wrists cracked -with

the way they pressed against his windpipe
then we must have tripped for first i knew
 was on my back and him on top but with
my arms still wedging his head off

  lying there with nothing to do but choke
the life out of a fellow human i looked
around at the general situation mrs
crocker and the harvard boy were standing
by the auto too surprised to yell anything
appropriate to the circumstances and off a
little ways was henrys boston priscilla
she didnt have that high-brow mile-away
look in her eyes now but something that
was bright and eager and-i hate to say it
-darn near murderous  followed the fire
from her eyes and saw henry and turner
rolling over and over in the sand like
twined-up tumble weeds fighting for the
very life of them then the chauffeurs
heels began kicking a tattoo on my shins
the way a man will when hes choking his
last and  let go and jumped to my feet
back of me christian was lying quiet on
his side while mike donlin pranced around
yelling for him to get up and finish it like
a man my friend with a taste of air was
gaping and gurgling and making out to
come to but hadnt a sand-fleas worth of
fight in him so i turned to help henry

  but the main show was over there too for
henry had both knees on turners stomach
and his fists were having the time of their
lives beating in the fellows face our
crowd had scored a triple knockout but
take it all round that rough and tumble
wasnt exactly a pretty sight for ladies it
had young harvard scared colorless and
mrs crocker was leaning against the side
of the auto or shed have toppled over as
 looked at those two something sailed in
between us-priscilla like the mayflower
in a storm at sea she floated right up to
henry adams and grabbed him by his
shoulder

  henry she cries

  henry let up on turner and got to his
feet but he didnt answer a word he didnt
have the nerve even to meet her eyes but
tried to pretend he was hunting in the sand
for a suspender button hed lost in the fight
then suddenly he seems to get up some
spunk and looks her in the face

  well prissy he says youve seen the
brute in me asserting itself havent you


short stories

i suppose after this ill never look the same
to you

  no you wont she cries and thank
god for that

  why what do you mean he asks hav-
ing trouble to get his mouth open and shut

  i mean that ive seen you act a mans
part she answers and im prouder of you
in overalls fighting like a hero than if you
were a college president

  but- asks henry but what will they
think of me in boston

  boston she says spitting out the word
as if it was a sour olive boston can go-
to halifax

  about an hour afterward we pulled into
camp vans wife driving the auto with the
ladies and we following in the other with
our prisoners tied up and lashed around
with ropes and straps and pieces of chain
till they didnt have a chance so much as to
sneeze when we got there you can take it
from me we kicked up some stir a good
deal more even than i had figured on for
some heated moments it looked as if those
ex-pirates were going to enjoy the luxury
of being lynched by millionaires for mr
buskirk and crocker were just like wild
animals when they heard how their women
had been treated and van wasnt much
better

  the big surprise though was when char-
lie chisel fastened his eye on christian and
turner-also it was the answer to why those
two were so all-fired keen about making a
quick getaway from camp just then

  theyd been in the gang that held charlie 
up the chauffeur too-charlies own
chauffeur-was a kind of silent partner to
the gang and had tipped em off to the
payroll job

  well sir you can doubt my word if you
want to when i tell you that charlie chisel
was glad to meet up with his old friends
again he was so thundering glad he
wanted to hug em to death-with a rope
and nothing could have kept him from it
except that maybe theyd squeal on the bal-
ance of their pals they did too about a
week later in the kern county jail-at least

christian turned states evidence though
that didnt let him out of ten years for the
auto stealing

  you might think this would be enough
lively doings for one day but it wasnt for
no sooner had we settled with the criminal
element of our programme than along
comes that boston pair henry and priscilla
theyd decided they said to get married at
the crockerss in los angeles and right
away too while they felt good and strong
for it

   i tell you its a terrible thing when little
inherited animals once get on the warpath
those two young people whod been
brought up to be turtles and always ex-
pected to be turtles broke away from every-
thing theyd ever learned and shed their
shells at the first touch and go of real life
all the years of exclusiveness just rolled
off em like a dog shaking himself after a
swim and the whole bunch of highbrow de-
grees henry had slaved himself weak in
the eyes for werent worth one blow of his
fists on turners face they went back fo
the wild those people did and i dont be-
lieve theyve ever come out of it

  in boston henry told me a betrothal ran
along from five to fifteen years and the
relatives and friends would come crawling
in a couple of months ahead of time from
the back bay and the fenway and sur-
rounding turtle ponds and thered be one
big dignified doings and then the happy
couple after a trip to italy would settle
down and live exclusively ever after

  this wedding though theyd arranged as
a personal insult to boston it wasnt only
going to be quick and sudden but every
man woman child or chinaman in the oil
fields that wanted to drop in for a free feed
was guaranteed a rousing welcome and the
one big time of his life new england
papers please copy

  it was a mighty lucky thing i thinks to
myself that those two had found each other
while the finding was good because boston
must be a pretty lonesome place for an
inherited animal without any mate dont
you think

watch for a piece of wrapping paper
the fetish of remorse

  by achmed abdullah

    author of the brother of eagles the tale of a bluff etc

    a tense and breathless story of the ruthless power
    of gold staged in the reeking tonkin jungle where
    death lurked behind every tree-a story with a
    surprise-and one that will leave you guessing as
    to the real source of a bob-tailed heart flush

anatole gautier lost all idea
of time and place twenty
years of life were wiped clean
from the slate of his memory
once more he was in tonkin
once more he was young and very enthusi-
astic once more he faced durand good
old durand the friend of his youth

  the moon a bloated thing of copper
swinging among the trees threw down a
single broad ray of orange which fell on
durands face gautier recognized the fa-
miliar features the round face the black
silken beard the crooked sabre cut across
the forehead which he had received at fenc-
ing school when the leather tip had slipped
from the blade

  they were both deep in thought some-
thing had to be done the tonkinese had
given them until daylight to decide two
more hours a low wind stirred the dead
leaves at their feet a wind as hot as a
breath of flame

  somewhere in the distance a jackal
howled

  they were both afraid of course but
there was something else a nameless
brooding sinister feeling which crept
through their souls a harshly discordant
note was pealing through the recesses of
their beings

  and so they looked into the spectre-
pregnatff stygian darkness and listened to
the night-soujds of soft-winged things
which flopped lazily overhead and of slimy
swishing things which glided and crawled
underfoot both were afraid to speak

  when on their way back to the cast to
saigon from the interior of french indo-
china their guides bearers and interpreter
had deserted them more than four days
ago here in the jungle they had not takn

it very much to heart they were young
and strong they were fairly familiar with
jungle-craft they would make the coast
somehow and then-just three minutes
talk with the agent of the australian syndi-
cate they would pass over what they had
brought from the interior and in return they
would receive a check of six figures even
split in two it would mean a comfortable
income for life more than that it would
mean riches and the chance to multiply
them

  then a few hours ago the tonkinese had
come from nowhere out of the jungle hun-
dreds of them tonkinese rebels they were
and they called themselves les poings du
patriotisme et de la paix-the fists of patri-
otism and peace-a gentle touch of mongol
humor which did not appeal to either gau-
tier or durand

  suddenly the two frenchmen had under-
stood why the guides and the interpreter
had deserted them it was evident that they
had been watched every step of the way
that even at the coast in the very office of
the australian agent there had been spies
in the pay of the peacock banner

  they were two against a small army
there would be no arguing no bargaining
whatsoever these yellow devils had the
whip-hand

  the leader of the tonkinese a tall court-
ly well-bred man had left them two hours
ago durand who had a smattering of the
local dialect had given greetings in it
florid flattering greetings the tonkinese
had bowed to the ground and had replied in
the same language

  by applying oil or flattery most things
are softened but these three never soften
a sword a leather receptacle for clarified
butter and a tonkinese


short stories



  then he had continued in french per-
fectly correct french though with the pe-
culiar stiff wording and the gentle sing-song
of the mongolian

  do not break your tongue over our bar-
baric patois my friend i speak french i
have lived in your country i have studied
in paris i have learned there that deal-
ings with christians are uncertain either
three times the principal is obtained-or
nothing at all thus shall i make sure to
obtain from you three times the principal

  there had been nothing intimidating in
his voice his accents had been rich and
gentle with a bronze tone to them like the
echoed murmurings of an ancient temple
gong

  look he had continued and his face
had been as stony and as passionless as that
of the buddha who meditates in the shade
of the cobras hood i am an open book
before you and i bid you read i am
vasanda

  he had paused they had shuddered at
the name and the tonkinese had smiled
gently very gently

  yes  am vasanda i am the man who
makes war on you french according to the
way we make war

  again he had smiled and again the two
frenchmen had shuddered for they had
heard at the coast about the way vasanda
the tonkinese outlaw-patriot he styled
himself-made war

  the tonkinese had bowed to the two
frenchmen

  with your permission he had squat-
ted easily on his heels and had lit a cig-
arette first courteously offering his case to
the two then he had continued i and
my young men have again stepped on the
path of strife we have performed the
proper ceremonies before the many shrines
we have laid naked blades on our shaven
heads thus symbolizing our voluntary re-
nunciation of this lifes vanities we have
offered rice and drink to the shades of the
departed heroes who died for our land in
the ancient days we have consecrated our
souls and our bodies to our people again
he had smiled a boyish impish smile but
it appears that prayers and the laying of
blades on shaven heads do not purchase the
rifles and ammunition the french are using

yet there is a shipment of such weapons
waiting for me somewhere-he had made
a vague circular gesture-but the payment
demanded for these so necessary weapons is
exorbitant also the foreigner who has the
weapons demands gold a cursed swine he
who will be born again in the bodies of
noisome crawling insects for many lives to
come but gold he demands and gold he
shall get it is an easy matter you may
consider it as done

  he gautier had then regained part of
his wits

  he had spoken with a suspicion of arro-
gance

  what have we got to do with it all
vassanda

  everything my master everything be-
cause look you you will supply the gold
you do not believe me behold i will
show you

  he had lit another cigarette swaying
gently from side to side to ease the strain
on his heels

  he had proceeded to explain that he knew
all about their little expedition how they
had visited the court of bah-ngoh the great
king of the interior who short of cash be-
cause of his latest fantastic harem extrava-
gancies had been forced to part with his
famed one hundred-carat pink diamond
the star of the middle kingdom how
even before leaving the coast they had
made arrangements with the australian
agent to sell the stone to him for five million
francs-ten times the sum which theyd pay
for the stone how they had completed their
transaction in the interior and were now
returning to the coast with the stone

  gautier had looked wild-eyed he had
stammered

  you-you want-the stone-the stone


  he had taken the diamond from an inner
pocket clutching it madly to his breast as
a mother clutches her first-bom when fever
stalks through the lard the light of the
camp fire had mirrored a thousandfold in
the facetings of the diamond like count-
less intersecting rainbows endless zigzag
flashings of electric blue and deep rose and
keen arrogant emerald-green like the
shooting of dragon-flies and purple-winged
tropical moths
the fetish of remorse



  but vasanda had only smiled and waved
the stone away

  no no by the lives of the many bod-
hisats i do not wish your plaything

  they had felt relieved at such altruism
but a moment later their relief had changed
into impotent hatred and rage

  vasanda had risen to his full height
there was a look in his oblique eyes as
sharp and clear as edges of splintered glass
his voice had lost its gentle soothing qual-
ity he was now speaking with harsh-
riveting emphasis

  what good is the stone to me i cannot
eat it i cannot drink it i cannot kill with
it i am not a woman of the inner bazaars
to long for scented hair oil and jewels
neither could  sell it for behold the
stone is known also is it known who
bought it the australian agent waits for
it now there at the coast he had point-
ed to the east into the silent brooding
jungle he is waiting and he is waiting
to pay-five million francs he will pay it
to the one of you two who brings the stone
such was your agreement for careful
men you considered the possibility of one
of you dying of fever an unhealthy land
this he had smiled and so it will be
one of you will go to the coast with the
stone he will go unharmed peaceful i
myself shall show him the right way he
will give the stone to the australian and re-
ceive the money-in gold then he will re-
turn to a place which i shall appoint with
the gold the other-i shall hold him as
hostage he shall be honorably treated
for thirty days i shall hold him for thirty
days  shall wait for the return of the first-
with the gold and then if he does not re-
turn with the gold also if he should play
false and talk to the french-and remember
that i have many spies-i shall kill the
hostage his voice had again been very
soft and gentle i shall kill him slowly
oh so very jowly there shall be no
hurry the first aay  hajj cut off an ear
and the next day his tongue perhaps a
matter of choice my friends ol the mo-
ments inspiration a little bit of h is throb-
bing body cut off to-day another to-mo rrow
thus for two weeks perhaps three it de-
pends upon the vitality of the man who is
being killed you both look strong anj

healthy you would last a long time under
the little knives raw wounds my friends
remember that also there will be insects
the flying cockroaches and the bramras
which follow the smell of blood and fester-
ing flesh also there will be ants many
ants and a thin river of honey to show them
the trail

  he had lit another cigarette he had
yawned then he had continued

  consider one goes to the coast the
other remains as my guest it has been
told me that you two love each other with
the love of twin brothers thus i believe
that he who goes to the coast will return-
with the gold it is a safe gamble i give
you two hours to decide which one of you
two shall go and which one shall stay be-
hind remember the little knives-and the
little ants which follow the trail of the
honey-

  the tonkinese had bowed and stepped
back into the black jungle

  and now the two hours were nearly over

  vasanda had said that they loved each
other with the love of twin brothers it
was true

  they had visited the same school in paris
they had been copains de lycee room-
mates class-mates bench-mates during the
long plastic years of childhood and youth
they had served in the same regiment at
tours they had sown their wild oats along
parallel lines no woman had even come
between them they had been apprentices
then clerks in the same office finally they
had established themselves in business as
partners they bought and sold precious
stones

  they were the best of friends they
knew that their mutual liking and friend-
ship their trust in each other their com-
bined honest square-souled decency and
strength was a solid edifice which sheltered
them against petty jealousy and envy

  when they had gone to tonkin to buy
jewels they had done so eagerly expectant-
ly a little adventure they thought a ray
of vivid tropical light to break into the
complacence of their home business and
they had done mighty well in the far east
during the two years of their stay

  finally had come their chance to buy and


short stories

sell the star of the middle kingdom the
famed pink diamond which had been the
dream of every jeweler for three genera-
tions it had been a big promising chance
and they had gone after it with the enthusi-
asm of youth

  yes they knew each other well and
they knew that each knew the other as well
as he knew himself and that their charac-
ters their virtues and their shortcomings
were exactly the same and so when vas-
anda had come to them out of the jungle
they felt suddenly as choked in mephitic
air the thought of the unspoken half-
formed desires in their hearts stretched be-
fore them as a boundless bog

  for knowing each other so well they
also knew that the foul tropics had bred in
each the sordid love of gain the cruel ruth-
lessness of desire they knew that though
enigmatic and close-hidden there was yet in
both their hearts that grim craving after
money-hard and merciless as a bitter-
cored stone fruit

  friends why of course they were
friends but then they had lived in the
tropics for two years breathing thinking
eating drinking the poison of the yellow
lands there was the chance to reach the
coast-with the stone-and then the aus-
tralian agent-the gold-and over there
across the way was paris

  friendship duty of friendship

   if friendship it was it was a friendship of
their own making-of their own unmaking
if they wished so they thought and each
could read the other as an open book for
they were friends who loved and knew each
other as twin brothers rocked in the same
cradle

  one would go to the coast-to bring the
gold the other would stay behind as a
hostage-and there were the little knives
and the ants which always follow the honey
trail

  and suddenly they knew both knew that
the one who would go to the coast would
never never come back for there were
five million francs in gold-and back yonder
was france paris home-and the chance
the lovable damnable chance

  suddenly durand laughed - that dry
harsh laugh of his-and he threw a greasy
pack of playing cards into the circle of mea-

ger light which came from the little camp
fire

  let the cards decide old friend he
shouted the loser stays the winner goes
to the coast and he returns here with the
gold-inside of thirty days it is under-
stood is it not mon vieux

  and again he laughed his cracked high-
pitched laugh

  of course gautier replied the win-
ner comes back with the gold-inside of
thirty days

  but he could not look into durands eyes
nor could durand look into his

  one hand of poker draw to your
cards and show-down cried durand

  anatole gautier picked up the deck he
shuffled slowly mechanically his thoughts
far away at the coast suddenly it seemed
to him that his brain was frantically tele-
graphing to his fingers a fit of nerves
no no he looked at his hands they
were shuffling shuffling in a perfectly nor-
mal perfectly steady manner it wasnt
nerves still his brain kept telegraphing
and he kept watching the motions of his
fingers-and then he saw that his second
finger and thumb had shuffled the ace of
clubs to the bottom of the deck

  had he done it on purpose he won-
dered all his life he had amused his friends
with card tricks he reflected there was
the coast there was the stone there
was the gold there was paris and here
was the stinking festering jungle-the ton-
kinese-vasanda-the little knives - and
the ants-the ants

  another ace joined the first at the bottom
of the deck-the third-the fourth

  then the harsh jarring arrogant voice
of jean durand

  deal damn you deal youll shuffle
all the spots from the cards gautier was
about to shuffle again but the other
stopped him with a savage gesture no
no no dont you dare shuffle them again

  gautier cleared a little space on the
ground with the point of his shoe the dead
leaves stirred with a dry rasping sound
something slimy and phosphorous-green
was rapidly squirming away

  cut durand

  he put the cards down between them on
the ground the other was calmly lighting
the fetish of remorse



a cigarette making no attempt to cut the
deck gautier spoke again there was
entreaty supplication despair in his tense
strained voice

  cut jean cut for the love of god

  the sweat was pouring from his face
little luminous blue spots were dancing in
front of his eyes something like a gigan-
tic sledgehammer was striking at the base
of his skull his blood throbbed thickly in
his veins his hands seemed swollen out
of proportion

  cut he cried again

  durand laughed at him with a mad de-
moniac light in his beady eyes he laughed

  no deal them as they lay i shant
cut you are too anxious for me to cut
too anxious no no deal and be damned
to you

  gautier dealt and mechanically even
as he was watching them his fingers gave to
himself five cards from the bottom of the
deck four of them were aces the fifth
was the queen of hearts

  durand picked up his hand he looked
at it he laughed again

  give me two cards anatole im going
to take a chance i have a hunch that ill
win

  gautier studied his own hand four aces
-and the queen of hearts the queen of
hearts he would never forget that red
queen she seemed to smile at him a
sardonic grirt-was on her silly painted lips

  the queen of hearts of course he would
discard her might as well make the other
believe that he had bought one of the aces
so he discarded the queen she fell face
upward the wind carried her a little to
one side-a little away from the circle of
light-over to where durand was sitting

  but still gautier could see the mocking
smile on her painted lips

  tben he dealt two cards to durand one
to himself

  there was a short tense silence durand
was studying his hand he looked up and
stared at gautier gautire felt embarrassed
did the other suspect him now was the
time to act to act well to simulate surprise
he looked away from the other he studied
his hand he studied it again and agaixi as
if he couldnt believe his eyes

  then he gave a mad shriek of joy

  i win i win four aces by the ma-
donna four aces

  and he threw his hand on the ground
face up

  durand picked it up he examined the
cards one by one

  one-two-three - four - four aces
his voice was thick choked

  then he studied his own cards again
and again beyond the feathery tops of
the trees a haggard morning sun was rising
a flickering pale-yellow ray fell on durands
face it looked drawn and green

  suddenly a change came over him he
straightened himself up he rose

  at the same moment vasanda stepped
out of the jungle he bowed deeply cour-
teously

  you have decided he asked in his
gentle sing-song

  yes it was durand who spoke i
stay with you gautier goes to the coast
he returns here with the gold-inside of
thirty days he broke into his dry harsh
high-pitched cackle he returns here with
the gold-with the gold-with the gold
au revoir mon ami

  he did not offer to shake hands he
bowed mockingly he was about to go
suddenly he noticed that the cards were still
clasped in his hand-the cards were losing
cards which had cost him fortune and life

  he threw them on the ground in front of
gautier face up a second later he was
gone

  anatole gautier looked dazed it seemed
to him that he had lived through all this
before in a former life yes it must
have been in a former life a former incar-
nation

  he remembered the whole scene every
single detail

  but wait wait there had been a dif-
ference what was it he thought and
thought and thought

  then doubt came into his soul had it
really all happened in a former incarnation
had it not been in this life twenty years
ago old memories flashed up in red
streaks

  yes twenty years ago he remembered
the whole scene but there was a differ-
ence a little difference


short stories

  suddenly he knew he knew where the
difference was there in that scene of
his dead life durand had gone into the
jungle of course he had lost he had
seen the four aces a nearly unbeatable
hand and then he had laughed but he
had torn the cards into small pieces he had
thrown the pieces into the dying camp fire

  and here-here were the cards whole
face up he looked at them he studied
them it was a heart flush-up to the queen

  the queen of hearts

  but he remembered that he himself had
discarded that same identical queen of
hearts a gust of wind had carried the bit
of pasteboard a little to one side to where
durand was sitting had then durand
cheated had he picked up the card to
make his flush

  gautier trembled in every limb he called
after the other

  durand oh durand

  the other turned and looked at him ques-
tioningly

  gautier stared he rubbed his eyes but
this was not durand at all this was jen-
kinson the american his friend and the
other the tonkinese by his side why it
was lee mon kau the chinaman with the
long gold-encased fingernails and the
heavy-lidded purple-black eyes

  suddenly the whole scene flashed up he
remembered why yes-this was paris-
his home and he had arranged it all he
and his two friends thomas jenkinson the
big good-natured slightly sarcastic ameri-
can and lee mon kau the chinaman
yes together they had arranged it all
he anatole gautier himself had coached
the american in the sound of durands
voice  he himself because he wanted
to get an actual picture an actual moment
of his dead life visualized once again
lived once again of course it sounded real
jenkinson did remarkably well jenkinson
should have been an actor   

  and of course the atmosphere the care-
fully staged carefully prepared atmosphere
of the room made the whole cursed impres-
sion more real than ever florist and
painter and decorator had joined hands to
change the large living room of his house
into a bit of tonkinese jungle even the
moist heat had been faithfully reproduced
also there was the incense that mad blue-
clouded indian incense in the jeweled silver
censer breath-clogging mind-choking and
the acting-the acting yes yes-he re-
membered it all

  he turned on jenkinson he spoke with
a thick angry voice

  you-why didnt you do as i told you
why didnt you tear up the cards as durand
did as he did twenty years ago look
-look-you picked up the queen of hearts
from the discard you cheated and du-
rand did not cheat it was i who cheated
i who killed my friend durand did not
cheat

  he broke into a paroxysm of tears

  lee mon kau smiled he opened the
windows a gust of fresh clean air came
from the garden

  jenkinson put his hand on the french-
mans shoulder

  yes durand tore up the cards so you
told me but then my friend how do you
know you did not see his hand he
might have cheated eh he might have
cheated

  gautier looked up he spoke mechan-
ically stupidly

  he might have cheated again and
again he said it he might have cheated
he might have cheated

  and suddenly with a great throaty cry of
relief he fell on his knees he raised his
hands above his head

  thank god thank god he shouted
he might have cheated

  and he dropped on the pround in a
swoon

a howelling tiine

 w-i-i-l-i-a-m d-e-a-n h-o-w-e-l-l-s t-o-n-i-g-h-t spelled a street gamin from a placard
 at which he was squinting with one eye closed

dandy boy and the
honrable mawde

by annesley burrowes

author of the long chance the man who ivouldnt marry the

flint skinners etc

in which the punchers down at the bunk house see the course
of true love interrupted but even dandy boy was forgotten
when the whole outfit went to denver to ride in the great
broncho busting contest for the honor of the old bar z

say that was the doggonest queer-
est outfit that ever come acrost
the old san angelo trail they
got it put together at the rail-
road and when it come up over
the big rise by the bar zee bunk house
ay it had buffalo bill skinned thirty-six
ways from the deuce

  buck lanfear leaned back against the
rocky hill-side and grinned under his brown
mustache his eyes traveled slowly across
the sunburned valley to the summits of the
apache range glowing in the rays of the
noonday sun in the upper air an eagle
whirled a thousand feet below a herd of
peccaries nosed through the mesquite look-
ing like weasels in the distance beyond
the blot of shade thrown by the single pine
the sun beat fiercely and the pinto tugged
at the long rope and whinnied

  he minds it said buck nodding side-
wise at his horse old easymark there
vas a three-year-old and he seen the whole
thing sames me

  the cowboy rolled a cigarette very slowly
as though the memory were pleasing to
him then lighted it and blew a lazy smoke
ring toward the blue sky of texas

  id been riding for the circle c most
five weeks he went on me being loaned
to old man chadwick along of curly weeks
and dad webster being shot up by a bunch
of sheepmen i got back to the bar zee
about four oclock of a saturday afternoon
there werent none of the boys in sight so
i set down on a bench and dropped into a
snooze then i wakes up quick-like nd
heres the grand procession just toppin the
se

  first comes the big noise-thats this

waldo emerson the bar zee manager im
just telling you about and hes looking sol-
emn like he was chief marshal at a elk
funeral then comes some of our boys
riding mighty polite and their faces was
dead straight

  then for fifty yards there aint nothing
but mesquite and then comes the main
show say youd swore it was the old
deadwood coach only twice as big and all
painted up green and yellow to beat four-
teen of a kind and up on the box seat driv-
ing four-in-hand like a old stager is the
lord-the gink wed heard tell of for years
but aint never seen him-the britisher
what owns the bar zee outfit

  i knowed it was the lord soon as i
seen him cause one of the boys had cut his
photograft out of a new york paper and
stuck it on the bunk-house wall he was
wearing white whiskers and likewise a
yellow overcoat with pearl buttons onto it
most as big as the bottom of a tin cup and
each one of them buttons had a different
picture on it-folks in uniforms riding
after houn-dawgs and shooting prairie
hens and catching fish-a different picture
on every button so help me gawd and each
of them as big around as a tin cup

  this here deadwood coach was full of
lady-folks and say they was the real per-
fectos just like them chromos what you
draws with fifteen cigaroot coupons and five
two-cent stamps

  following after the coach comes a
string of buckboards full of menials and
then more of our boys each of them towing
a long-necked horse what was groomed so
fine you could almost see to shave in him
and each of them ornery punchers looking




short stories

sheepish like he was piloting a zebra outn
the zoo

  well this here cavalcade prances up to
the ranch house and the deadwood coach
vomits out its lady-folks and the menials
crawls out of the buckboards and down
comes the lord off of the box and passes
his picture-gallery overcoat to his valet and
they canters into the house

  but the main actors is still to come
and the bunch aint scarcely inside when
down the trail comes a pink-and-white girl
riding hell-to-split on a tall black and this
here girl is a dead ringer for mile dolly
de belmont the champeen equestrienne
what you see with the big show only be-
lieve me she has dolly de belmont backed
clean off the map for looks

  shes wearing a little derby hat like
mile de belmont and riding side-saddle
with one of them long slimsy black gowns
that most touches the ground and as she
gewhizzes past she looks at me out of a
pair of big brown eyes and throws the nicest
smile you ever seen on a girl i tell you
she most has me goin and as i stands
there in the middle of the trail a-goggling
im most knocked off my feet by a dandy
boy wearing balloon pants like he was
george gould and he goes shooting past
on a big chestnut mare hes a right smart
looking kid too with a clean shaved brown
face and good shoulders and by the way
he looks after the girl you can tell he dont
see the trail or the ranch house or the big
blue sky all he sees is the girl and look-
ing after them two folks i gets a hunch
therell be doings on the old bar zee

  well dandy boy passes her just as they
gets to the house he jumps off his horse
like he was a real rider and helps her down
then they lopes inside and i got a chanct
to round up old baldy and ask him whats
the dope

  its lord bruton says baldy the boss
from over home we been dreadin for
years hed be horning in on us and now
he says its came the boys is plumb loco
but the big noise hes enjoying himself
like he was a rat in a pork barl

  well as baldy dopes it out seems like
the lord has gone most broke playing the
horses and picking the one worst bet in the
stock market and so hes come out to the

bar zee to economize bringing mrs lord
and his three sisters whats named the
honrable miss king-harmons likewise his
daughter the pink-and-white girl and shes
christened the honrable mawde sybil
gwendoline fraunces king-harmon dye
get that and her only a heifer just rising
eighteen likewise dandy boy hes a
lords son and a honrable only his names
the honrable john smith which he spells
it smythe for decencys sake his grand-
father having been in the beer trade thats
a fine bunch of honrables aint it most
as many as they have on the board of edu-
cation over to tombstone

  this here honrable mawde is a fine up-
standing girl with wide shoulders and a lit-
tle waist and cheeks on her like a pair of
missouri peaches so it aint long before
the boys is peekin at her sly-like and
mighty wishful and shes aglimpsing back
at them kind of admiring like she thought
cowboys was the real cheese though of
course the boys wouldnt have the nerve to
get friendly them being just ornery punch-
ers and her being the lords daughter but
the big noise thats this here emerson
man the ranch manager there aint noth-
ing bashful about him hes johnny-on-the-
spot with a red necktie and new brown
boots all a-shining and a clean shave and
his teeth scrubbed up like they was marble
headstones and honest-to-josh hes looking
most like a lord himself hes a handsome
guy this here emerson just like one of
them cowboy pictures on the cover of a
story book and he fixes it to get acrost with
this whole bunch so its emerson here
and mr emerson there till the big noise
gets to be a howling hurricane and yet
hes known all through the cow country for
a skunk and a four-flusher and one thatll
back down before any real man that stands
up to him but at that i got to hiid it to
him as a cow man he knov his business
hes the best rider in the state and what he
cant do to a steer you can just as well for-
get it

  well while this emerson is putting it
over on the lord and the ladies dandy boy
thats this honrable john smythe hes
making good with the boys he aint no
conversationer he dont talk none no mor
than he was a sheep-herder and yet ever
dandy boy and the honrable mawde 

one on the outfit knows him for a man and
likes him as such of course the boys cant
help joshing a bit and they slips him a
few such as always is coming to a tender-
foot but dandy boy stands for it like a
sport and before long i tell you hombre
english-lord stock is over par on the bar
zee only this here negras what had a
greaser for a father and his mother come
off the bowery - this here negras he
reckons its up to him to show dandy boy
where he belongs

  so when one of the boys hands out a
story like punchers always passes to the
simple stranger this negras lets out a yawp
you can hear clear up to the ranch house
where honrable mawdes layin in a ham-
mock telling this emerson party what
grand people punchers is and how she ad-
mires to meet up with a gentleman whats a
real man

  by this time honrable mawde and em-
ersons so thick the boys is wondering where
dandy boy comes in of course we know
dandy boys always stood ace-high with
the lord and the girl too and if emersons
trying to get her as it sure looks that way
it wont be no cinch and hell be trying
some of them low-down games hes noted
for so when he starts getting next to this
negras person and playing him favorite
like he never done before i dopes it out
that dandy boys going to have something
on his hands like he dont see in shropshire
after thinking it over some i passes him
the tip but he only smiles that quiet way
the boys likes

  perhaps ill be before him he says and
he dont say no more which seems nervy
talk for a tenderfoot

  well this negras party from yawping
every time one of the boys passes one to
dandy boy-this negras starts to hand out
a few himself and my soul as dandy boy
says they w-as sure raw ones dandy boy
stands for it longer than hed ought to and
then he says one night careiess and quiet-
like he says

   hombre he says your style of humor
is unpleasing to me amuse yourself to-
night all you want he says and then cut
it out otherwise he says it might have a
ngrowing effect on your health

  next evening when dandy boy comes

down negras starts something again it
aint much but dandy boy just reaches
forward like he was picking a cherry and he
passes negras a little jolt on the jaw much
as to say i dont want to take no advantage
of your innocence but this is just to let
you know theres more like it in the same
corral

  negras lets out a squawk and jumps
back and i reckon all the greaser blood hes
got is right plumb in his ugly face he
reaches in through the window grabs a
butcher knife that lays handy on the table
and jumps fer him

  dandy boy dont move he dont even
bat an eye he just stands there smoking
his cigaroot and looking pleasant but
every puncher in the bunch is moving and
they pree-cipitates theirselves onto negras
like a thousand of brick and when the dust
clears negras is on the ground all covered
with cowboys settin on him

   let him up says dandy boy sharp-
like and six punchers crawls offn the body
mighty unwilling

   give him his knife

   no by g- says baldy holding to

it hard

   give it back i say raps out dandy
boy quick and stern like he was talking to
soldiers fall back you men

  the boys stands back kind of scared and
startled cause they never seen dandy boy
like that before and baldy he throws the
knife on the ground a-cursing

  negras grabs it and jumps for dandy
boy like a catamount dandy boy meets
him square

  honest-to-josh hombre it looked like
a miracle i dont know how dandy boy
done it but there he was smoking his ciga-
root with the knife in his hand and negras
hes on his back ten foot away yawping
and feeling to see if his arm was broke

   come on says dandy boy to negras
quiet and pleasant like he was talking to a
lady hurry up he says if you dont mind
im due back to the house

  negras turns to get away but big larry
teagan grabs him by the neck turns him
round and passes him a kick in the stern
gwan in ye coyote he says to him
fight

  by this time dandy boy has a fresh


short stories

cigaroot lit and dont never take it out of
his mouth while he gives negras what
teagan called the father an mother of a
batin finally negras gets in a clinch and
the following second hes on his back tak-
ing the count having been thrown clear
over dandy boys head

  say was there some yellings well
youre a tootin you could hear them boys
clear over to the lazy y yawping like a
bunch of navajos just to see a lords son
put it over on a puncher like that say
every one of them boys wants to shake
hands with dandy boy at onct and even
negras having come to and his bowery
blood boiling up on top-this here negras
comes up mighty sheepish and holds out
his hand and dandy boy takes it like a man
and says boys he says this is just a bit
of good humor between ourselves dont
let it go no further than us he says and
specially not up to the house this here
negras he says is going to be a friend of
mine

  say wasnt that great well in a min-
ute the big noise comes down a-towing the
honrable mawde and they wants to know
wat tell and dandy boy he says weve
been enjoying a bit of a friendly set-to and
the honrable mawde asks us wont we
please show her how them things is dragged
off

  so two of the boys does a little vaw-de-
vill stunt and honrable mawde says its
plumb grand thats all theres to it but
say after that if the bar zee outfit was this
here electoral college and dandy boy wants
to be president of the u-nited states say
all hes got to do is whistle for it

  by and bye we hears things about dandy
boy he dont never hand out no dope
about himself but bud skinner gets it on
the side being strong with the honrable
mawdes hired girl what they call a ladys
maid seems like dandy boy is a soldier
out to india and bud skinner gets it off the
ladys maid that he belongs to what they
call the extinguished service order along of
rounding up a bunch of brown niggers
whats stampeding with a gatling gun and
that sends his stock up some more not so
much account of what he done but because
he keeps so darned quiet about it and bud
skinner he gets it off the ladys maid that

the general thanks dandy boy in front of
the regiment and that if dandy boy wants
he can write a lot a letters after his name
showing what he done only he dont want
to and bud gets it that dandy boy and the
honrable mawde was sort of half engaged
but not quite

  now wouldnt you gamble that honra-
ble mawde would be proud to have a man
like dandy boy a-chasing her well she
aint shes been reading story books till
shes plumb loco she thinks cow punchers
is grand and she picks this ornery pusil-
lanimous cuss emerson as the real feath-
ers shes always settin round with him
talking about manhood and strength and
primal instincts and cowfeed like that and
dandy boy dont seem to be in it no more

  of course dandy boy gets plumb sore
but whats he going to do hes too proud
to mix in with emerson and he sure aint
going to squeal to the lord so he just dont
do nothing but if you watch him close you
can see hes losing flesh and color the
boys seen it same as me and i tell you it
made us feel bad course the lord aint on
to this he dont reckon emersons in the
game no more than was nigger jim carry-
ing water to them long-necked horses in the
box stalls but you-bet-you if it comes to
a showdown between them three therell be
some bucking on the part of this here lord
thatll make a untamed broncho look like it
was a pet kitten

  well about now honrable mawde she
reads a story-piece about a ropin some-
wheres up in wyoming and nothing does
her but we has a little ropin all to ourselves
and the lord hes got to give a prize of
fifty dollars for the champeen of the bar
zee

  so the boys has to round up a bunch of
bad steers and the ropin is dragged off
say i sure got to hand it to this here emer-
son when it comes to tying a steer they
aint his equal in the stsfe and if he wasnt
such a yellow dog i could stand for him but
of course he had to do a bunch of grand-
stand stunts that spoiled his work as a real
rider looks at it but honrable mawde
she dont understand them things she
tfiinks emersons circus riding is plumb
gl-and and when he takes the fifty for ropin
and tying which he certainly deserved it
dandy boy and the honrable mawde 

and spends the money on books for to uplift
us punchers why say there aint nobody
like this here emerson and dandy boy
whats a real man hes all to the bad

  after the ropin its plain that theres
only two things for dandy boy to do hes
got to call this here emerson or quit the
game course dandy boy wont shoot
none it aint his way and the boys dont
expect it of him so it aint no big surprise
when he says to me one night pretty soon
buck he says im bliged if youll hook
up the buckboard early to-morrow and drive
me over to railroad he says im going
away

  he didnt say no more and when i told
the boys them words honest to josh they
most bellered-to think dandy boy had
been beat out by the big noise

  next day me and him drives over to the
railroad and all the way over dandy boy
dont open his head and i dont have noth-
ing to say neither i gets his baggage
checked and then the train comes whoop-
ing along and we says good-bye

   if youre ever in england buck he
says-thems his very words-if youre
ever in england he says come to see me
at hawkwood thats his fathers ranch-
and he says ill try and give you as good
a time as youve give me and he says i
want you to come and he gets aboard

  as the train pulled out i seen him come
onto the back platform and he stood there a
long time looking back wistful and the last
i seen him when the train rounded the
curve he was waving his hand at me

  so i goes over to the ho-tel and gets all
lit up and i stayed there three days
a-whooping it on the level hombre i
couldnt of drove home no sooner not if
id stood to win the whole blamed outfit

  well with dandy boy off the place
things plumb different everybody seems
kind of iciesome except this here emer-
son and hes grinning like a she-wolf only
this ladys maid she gives it to bud skinner
that when honrable mawdes around em-
ersons looking like he was a sick hen the
way lovers does when they are trying to
make a hit off one whats above them

  by-and-bye this ladys maid hears he
two of them talking and emerson singing
a song like how turrible it is to be born poor

when the girl you worships is far far above
you and honrable mawde tells him the
rank is but the guinea stamp and the mans
the whole carcass and this here emerson
ups and puts it to her straight-wont she
fly with him and honrable mawde she
says this is so sudden and it is a turrible
step for a girl to take and she must have
time to think and emerson he makes
a big squawk about if she loves him like he
loves her she wont want no time and he
most has her goin when all of a sudden the
lord he horns in with a newspaper all about
the big fall bustin up to denver and he
says emerson is got to enter for the cham-
peenship of the world and hell take along
the whole blamed outfit to see him win the
belt and the dough goes with it hon-
rable mawde she says thats magnifcent

  so whats this unhappy emerson party
to do the lord tells him to rustle round
pronto and get things in shape for time is
short so off goes emerson but this here
ladys maid she seen his face and she gives
it to bud skinner that he looks like a tiger
balked of his prey thems the exact terms
what she used and bud he gives it to the
boys while we was bedding down at the
bunk-house

  that same night when the ladys maid
is doing the honrable mawdes hair she
ups and tells casual-like what the boys
thinks about the big noise and honrable
mawde she gets mad as a wet hen and tells
this maid she dont want to listen to no gos-
sip from the bunk-house and shes plumb
surprised that this maid would dare to have
the nerve to mention it to her course the
maid says shes plumb sorry but she gives
it to bud skinner that honrable mawde
aint spoke to her since except to order her
round this maid tells bud he aint to
breathe it to nobody and bud says sure he
wont but when he gets down to the bunk-
house course he couldnt hold a thing like
that

  next thing we gets emerson is still
keeping after her hard but honrable
mawde seems to be stalling him off and
this ladys maid she catches honrable
mawde setting alone looking at dandy
boys picture and sort of half crying and
i tell you we was all wishing dandy boy
was back again but nobody aint heard from


short stories

him since he got to chicago and they
reckon hes gone back across the salt water

   course the boys is all tore up over it
and the bettings about even some saying
that if emerson cant get her now he wont
never get her and some saying that when
he gets the belt as he sure will honrable
mawde will be so dippy hell have her
roped and tied within forty-eight hours me
i dopes it out that honrable mawdes
about half woke up only shes in so darned
deep with emerson she dont know how
shes going to pull out shes sure did
every blamed thing that would make a man
like emerson do what he done but now hes
gone and did it she wishes he wouldnt 
tell you these women peoples all alike
dont matter whether its the lords daugh-
ter or mandy jane the biscuit shooter over
to the grand union eating shack and right
now if this emerson coyote has the nerve to
throw honrable mawde acrost his cow
horse and ride over to the nearest minis-
ter id bet my shirt honrable mawde dont
tell him no when he gets her there

  next evening this here ladys maid
passes it out to bud skinner that emersons
been in and made a strong play to get hon-
rable mawde away because were all start-
ing for denver in the morning but seems
the honrable mawde dont fall for him but
finally he wants her to say that if he wins
the belt she wont hold him off no longer
and he makes her say it and this ladys
maid she says honrable mawde is like a
dove in the talents of a hawk-thems her
exact words-and honrable mawdes been
crying all evening and she says emer-
sons going to get her because honrable
mawdes all in and wont have the nerve to
hold him off no longer belt or no belt and
when bud skinner reels this off down to the
bunk-house honest to gawd it dont take
much more to make the boys get out their
gats and go after this here emerson they
talked that way but nothing come of it

  we gets to denver just in time for the
first days bustin and i tell you when our
outfit canters onto the field we has em all
a-rubbering the lord has on his overcoat
with the pictures on the buttons and the
deadwood coach is all a-shining and the
four long-necks is groomed to a finish and
the ladies is all got their paris gowns and

us punchers riding two-and-two on our cow-
horses with our guns and chaps and all
the regalia we got and theys three or four
eastern dudes along with the lords party
and i tell you when the crowd sees us they
sets up a roar like we was the president of
the u-nited states and all the white house
ladies

  the party dont get off the coach at all
theyre showing people how they act over
home so they just pulls up a little way
from the stand and they stays right there
a-top they has champagne on ice and
sandwiches and jellied birds and all kinds
of eatings and theres emerson along with
the dudes all slicked up in a suit of fifth
avenue fixings and say on the level this
here emerson he looks as good as any of
them and honrable mawde she acts kind
of chirked up like she was glad to see him
looking so slick beside them dudes
seemed like she was thinking after all he
aint such a bad bargain

  well i aint going to tell you all about
this here bustin youve saw the stands
and the flags and the crowds and all such
theres the usual skirmishing-loose horses
tearing round the field judges and ropers
running up and down the air full of dust
the bands playing bad horses thrun down
and kicked up and saddled and rid to a fin-
ish and there was riders bucked off and
riders pulling leather and riders a-riding on
the cinch and riders playing to the stand
and riders that rides like they was real rid-
ers and judges cutting out the good ones
and passing up the mavericks sos to settle
whose the champion of the world

  i tell you hombre thats the greatest
sight on earth and the lord and ladies is
pleased clean to the bones even honrable
mawde with emerson a-hanging over her
head like the sword of dammickels as this
maid tells it even honrable mawdes pok-
ing like she never see such a and sight
before and that day she learns things about
clean riding pha dirty riding and grand-
stand riding that she never knowed before
and i reckon about this time she begins to
guess that emersons doings at the bar zee
ropin  werent the real pigskin like she
thought they was i was watching her dost
and it seems to me like honrable mawde
was kind of woke up
dandy boy and the honrable mawde 

  next day emerson has to ride and he
leaves his dude fixings down to the ho-tel
and wears his regular riding outfit he
rides twict that day and it sure was a sight
to look at him hes known for a skunk
wherever theres cowmen but the boys
couldnt help but cheer him then of course
he gets all swole up and has to start play-
ing to the stand he starts bowing and
grinning and a-waving and doing stunts
that looks good to the tenderfoot but they
aint riding

  then the real cow people thats cheering
they quits it cold and when emerson rides
again and starts drinking out of a bottle
with his horse a-jumping why that makes
us all plumb sick and when i looks at
honrable mawde she aint watching em-
erson she has her eyes on some of the
boys and i guess she hears things and is
looking kind of sadful and some ashamed

  so i dopes it out shes thinking about
this here bunk-house gossip what she
wouldnt hear the maid tell to her

  by this time everybody knows who the
lord is and the big men from all over the
west are coming up and making their-
selves acquainted and welcoming him to
the country the valets passing out the
wine and seegars like a bartender but no-
body mentions nothing about the big
noise which the lord thinks some queer
by-and-bye the lord mentions this emerson
and while they all has to admit that emer-
son can ride they quits right there and the
lord seems to gather that this emerson
party aint liked

  then after the bustin is over for the
day the judges comes up to welcome the
lord to their midst and taste his cham-
pagne and when theyre going away mighty
pleased one of the judges tips it off to him
friendly-iile that his manager is sure a
rider but the lord better tell him to quit this
monkey-riding or hes going to lose the belt

  well that iiieht this ladys maid gets off
and goes to the show wifn bud skinner and
she gives it to bud that she hesrs the lord
telling the lady-folks about ths judges
warning emerson and bud he gets- it that
honrable mawde she wont eat no dinner
that night and goes to bed sick and wont
have the maid undress her and thats how
this maid gets to the show with bud and

this maid gives it to bud that honrable
mawde shes all a-trembling and white as
a sheet so i guess honrable mawde is
awoke

  the third day of the bustin were all
there honrable mawde and the whole
bunch the deadwood coach is the poplar
centre of interest theys always a crowd
round and the valet is dealing out seegars
and sandwiches like it was a free lunch
counter this is the busy day for the
judges they was fifty riders and nobody
defending the title and they has to work
the candidates clean to the limit so as to
pick the man whats sure best

  emersons riding again to-day but still
he cant help showing off a little-not much
but just enough to kind of rile the boys up
i take notice of honrable mawde and she
aint looking at him at all shes watching
the people she knows is off the range and
they aint doing any yellings for emerson
all the cheering is done by the towners in
the stands but i tell you the cow people
is dead scared emersons going to get the
belt and there aint a puncher on the
ground wouldnt give a months pay to see
him beat well that night they was a
mighty sick bunch for emerson is still in
the ring and theres only one rider left to
stand between him and the champeenship

  the judges might have made emerson
ride again that day and beat him because
he was tired and the other man is fresh but
you know what them judges is they was
dead sore on emerson but theyd give him
the last chanct to win even if it broke their
hearts so it went over for another day

  you can bet when the show opens the
next day there aint a vacant seat in the
stands the citys plumb empty and every
human being thats got the price is there to
see the big ride-off for the champeenship of
the world of course the deadwood coach
is on hand and theres a hundred punchers
and cowmen close to it

  the other man is the first to ride and
theres a big roar when the judges calls
him out seems like he comes way down
from idaho and aint rid the range for six
years but when he was riding for old
judge larkin up in idaho they say there
werent his beat for a horse-wrangler in the
whole west hes a likely looking critter


short stories

too well set-up with a heavy brown mus-
tache and a little chin whisker and looks
good in his gray wolf-skin chaps and his
hat turned down over his eyes you can
bet the boys gives him a hot send-off

  the judges has picked a big black for
him a horse they call blackie with a white
stocking thats said to be the hottest stuff
they got

  blackie stands for the saddle like a lamb
and he keeps standing while idaho mounts
him slow and careful keeping an eye on
his head

  but idahos feet aint scarcely in the
stirrups when the black goes up in the air
like a rocket and comes down like a ton of
brick he goes up and down up and down
four times just like that and then shoots
acrost the fiela like a whirlwind twist
and turn sun-fish side-buck crow-hop
rear and jolt say there wasnt anything
a bad horse ever done that this here one
fergot

  gee how the boys yelled and this here
idaho a-sittin him like he growed there

  right turn left turn but idahos always
ahead of him just as if he knew what
blackies doing before blackie knows it
himself

  youve heard the boys yell yip yip
rider rider hes a rider go it idaho
the whole mobs yawping like injuns and
the judges howling with the rest of them
and idaho you bet he rides

  up in the air goes the black and then
straight ahead pitching like a crazy ship in
a typhoon and idaho a-settin as cam as a
bird and gracefully swinging the quirt at
every jump

  the wire fence is just ahead and
blackie shoots over and dives into it head
down like a battering ram the wire gives
and springs back throwing idaho and the
black into a tangle of hoofs and legs and
dust and the crowd falls dead silent but
when the black comes up on his feet again
by gosh idahos right there in the saddle
the black cant shake him he shoots half
across the field and stops dead in his tracks
all sweating and trembling and beat to a
finish

   all in  yells the ropers

   get down shouts the judges and then
the crowd breaks into whoopings and yell-

ings such as you never heard and they
makes a run to grab idaho but the judges
and ropers drives them back and then they
call emerson

  the big noise comes out grinning and
swaggering as he passes the coach he
looks up at where honrable mawdes set-
tin and smiles at her but she dont smile
back it seems to me his face is kind of
pale and green looking and the smile dont
set straight theyre holding a savage-
looking gray for him thats ramping and
fighting like a she-lion

  emerson walks over hes still grin-
ning but there aint no spring to his gait
and when he half turns i see his face is
gone white like paper

  he takes his saddle off his shoulder and
goes to her and the mare turns and rises at
him like a whirlwind emerson jumps
back like he was a tenderfoot then he
turns and throws his saddle on the ground
and you can see hes trembling like a leaf

   boys he says i-i cant ride i-im
sick

  and the word goes whooping through
the crowd that emerson wont ride because
hes sick and he sure was sick but it was
just the yellow boiling out of his gizzard
and poisoning his blood because idahos
made a great ride and emerson is dead
scared he couldnt beat it

  i looks at honrable mawde on top the
coach and i lets out a yell cause i can see
shes half glad and half sort of relieved-
lookin then the secretarys buckling the
belt on the idaho party the crowds yell-
ing like they was crazy and the punchers is
most tearing idaho limb from limb

  the lord hes plumb disgusted but hes
a good loser and he says aw he says i
should like to congratulate this aw-cham-
peen

  one of the big cowmen starts awav and
ina few minutes come back a-tovinj judge
larkin and this idaho with his hat pulled
way down like a tough man and the judge
he says lord bruton he says let me
make you acquainted with buster jack of
idaho hes rid range fer me six years ago
and hes just come back acrost the salt
water you got a right to be proud of a
countryman of yourn he says whats the
best rider in the world
dandy boy and the honrable mawde 

  the lord turns to honrable mawde
whats come down off the coach and says
he mawde he says this is mr buster
jack of idaho

  honrable mawdes a-looking at this
here buster person kind of scared-like and
when he pulls off his big hat thats been
down covering his eyes she gives a sort of
little scream and the lord and me say we
most drops dead fer ill be gosh-dinged if
it aint the honrable john smythe-dandy
boy

  honrable mawde stands a-swayin for a
second with a look on her like somebody
had saved her from drowning then she
jumps for dandy boy and him all in his
chaps and covered with sweat and she
grabs him

  then everybody yells again but the bar
zee boys feels kind of fooled

  for a lords son theyd thought dandy
boy licked the universe but course if he
was a puncher himself there werent noth-
ing so wonderful bout what he done

whipples revenge

 it all started with the refusal of the first nationals president to make a loan of fifty
 thousand dollars to the iron and steel concern

 this angered whipple the companys president and one day he strode into the bank
 with two checks in his hand one was the check of the firm for the total amount of its
 cash balance in the bank and the other covered the amount of his private deposits

 it was his purpose to withdraw both and to cut all connection with the disagreeable and
 old-fashioned bank

 give me all the money on these checks he said sternly to the cashier

 how will you have it sir the cashier asked coldly

 large bills returned whipple laconically the largest youve got im going to take
 it over to donaldson for purposes of deposit

 he said this with a grin the cashier stepped into the vault he called to two or three
 of the clerks to assist him

 behind the spot where whipple stood there was a large old-fashioned table each
 clerk as he left the vault placed something on this table and went back for more

 finally they stopped coming and going and the cashier with a sardonic grin pointed to
 the pyramidal pile on the old table

 sir said the cashier politely sorry that we are out of large bills to-day i think
 your money is all there

 whipple looked at it he was unmoved though it would have taken a horse and wagon
 to carry all the coins away

 i want to count this cash he said pleasantly i have forgotten the amount of the
 checks please let me see them will you

 the cashier beside himself with inward laughter handed out the checks

 now said whipple seating himself will you just open each one of these bags so
 that i may count the coins

sir said the cashier it will take you a week this is not a boarding house

for answer whipple pointed to the count your cash before leaving the window sign

 i do but follow your directions he returned

 all right answered the cashier and he untied the bags

 then hastily and before they knew what he was doing f w whipple president of
 me nroe iron and steel company thrust his hand into the first bag and took from it a
 very small handful of coins he did the self-same thing with each bag in turn

 when whipple had finished two of his pockets were more or less laden with small coin
 gentlemen he said with  smile as he placed in his pocket the two checks which he
 had held in his hand i have changed my mind i shall not withdraw my whole account
 from the bank i have determined to take with me only that which i have placed in my
 pockets you may charge my accojnt with just what i took

 the devil muttered the cashier how much did you take

 that gentlemen returned f w whipple unmoved you may best determine by
 counting what is left

 and they had to do it
the sniper

by albert dorrington

author of death echo canon etc

this is not a war story but a story of london in
war times as full of suprises as a nut is of meat

 we can often name the german
 soldier who shot your husband
 brother or son we give fuller de-
 tails than the war office our
 system is purely scientific it is the
 result of a specialized and far-
 reaching inquiry service

it was a bold advertisement and oc-
cupied half the window space of the
international inquiry bureau pedes-
trians sometimes halted with a jerk to
read it men and women with sons
and relatives fighting in flanders passed on
wondering whether such claims were gen-
uine or merely the effusions of commission-
hunting charlatans

  it wouldnt be hard for them to tell us
more than the war office a man stated
huskily all the same i dont think any
institution can live up to that press notice
it beats sherlock holmes to a frazzle

  at the end of a white-paneled corridor
in one of the bureaus most daintily fur-
nished chambers sat cayley troop chief
of the inquiry department the top of
troops head was pink and bald his eyes
narrow at the points as though the blinding
light of his discoveries had pinched them
clients learned to regard him as a kind of
human eagle chained to a desk the pro-
fessional glitter in his eye was more con-
vincing than the office window advertise-
ment and the sheep-faced inquirer who
entered to consult him about a missing
brother or son at the front was soon at his
ease regarding troops knowledge of ger-
man brigades and units his almost occult
powers of divining inpenetrable secrets

  a pale overworked secretary appeared in
the doorway and coughed to attract his at-
tention mrs lorimer has just called
sir he announced may i show her in
troop looked up from his desk and pon-
dered swiftly the name lorimer was fa-

miliar her case had interested him six
months before her husband noel lorimer
had gone to the front as a member of the
army medical corps he had been shot by
a german sniper at a farmhouse near la
vendee troop had noted a look of horror
in the young widows eye at the way her
husband had been picked off while render-
ing aid to the wounded and dying pretty
women always interested troop especially
in their moments of grief and despair he
knew that many of these young widows
would cheerfully shoot at sight the slayers
of their husbands

  he had consoled her but while stressing
the difficulty of dealing with the enemys
hired assassins had assured her that even
a commissioned sniper in the german army
was not beyond reckoning with he had
invited her to call again

  he nodded to the secretary and a few
moments later the widow of noel lorimer
was seated before him she was not more
than twenty with a touch of the spaniard
in her slow burning eyes each movement
conveyed something of the suave beauty of
her supple young body yet despite her
charm of gesture and speech troop diag-
nosed a mutinous anger against the sniper
of la vendee

  my coming here may seem childish mr
troop she began somewhat passionately
i can think of nothing but this miscreant
who could shoot a defenceless man striving
to aid the wounded and maimed

  troop inclined sympathetically thw very
slowly opened a letter with belgian post-
mark he read it pensively while the si-
lence of infinity seemed to leap between
them afver awhile he spoke and his words
were lik e a sword-cut

  thy sniper who shot your husband is in
england mrs lorimer i may add that he
is employed at the present moment in this
ci ty


the sniper



  she stood up swaying slightly against the
chair the red signals from her heart flash-
ing in her cheeks do you mean that he is
a prisoner she demanded

  the bald pink head shook he is a free
man mrs lorimer after the fall of ant-
werp he deserted the german army and
came here in the guise of a belgian refugee
at present he is known as auguste wie-
gand his real name is louis brandenberg
he belonged to the th bavarian regiment
stationed at la vendee being an excel-
lent shot he volunteered to take up a posi-
tion near an old farmhouse at st meuve
it was from this hiding place that he picked
off your husband

  the slow fire in beatrice lorimers eyes
seemed to darken and blaze what is
brandenberg doing in this country she
demanded

  troops answer was short-clipped and
precise he is a waiter do you want the
name of his hotel

  the blood-red of her cheeks grew ashen
for an instant he thought she would col-
lapse then there must be no mistake
about this snipers identity mr troop what
proof have you that he is the man who shot
my husband

  troops face seemed to recede and then
dart toward his questioner after shoot-
ing your husband brandenberg descended
from his hiding place and stole his note
book i believe that this note book is still
in his possession there is no doubt what-
ever concerning the fellows identity do
you want his address

  i do her whole being seemed to
vibrate in her pent-up anger against the
privileged assassin who had taken her hus-
bands life if noel had been a soldier
carrying arms i could have born no enmity
he was murdered while succoring the dy-
ng and this miscreant brandenberg is

permitttu to-do-

  go to the authorities if you will
troop interrupted gently but your case
may be difficult to prove although i as di-
rector of this institution am positi ve that he
is the sniper of la vendee

  i shall not go to the authorities they
will allow him to escape give me the
name of brandenbergs hotel i shall nt
trouble you further

  troop coughed and allowed an unbirdlike
smile to soften his eagle expression we
have been to some expense in this matter
mrs lorimer you will readily under-
stand-

  how much she interrupted

  the unbirdlike smile vanished and the
eagle eye explored the expensive jewelry
about her wrists and throat the diamonds
peeping at him in clusters from the neck-
lace she wore let us say two hundred
guineas mrs lorimer and you shall have
the pleasure of meeting the sniper who put
a bullet through your husbands heart

  she took a check book from her pocket
filled in the amount with a pen from the
desk and passed it to him

  troop glanced at the signature as he
thrust it carelessly into a drawer then drew
an envelope from a near pigeon-hole on
it was written

              auguste wiegand
                  hotel mazarin

piccadilly

ii

 beatrice lorimer entered the hotel
mazarin like a priestess ascending an altar
steps a watchful attendant hurried near to
inquire her wants and to assure her that
the excellent service of the hotel was at her
disposal

  she followed him to a small private din-
ing room where a mirror above the oak
mantelpiece showed the faint scarlet of her
cheeks the almost ghostly brilliance of her
eyes almost mechanically she sat at the
little table while the attendant vanished to
announce her coming for several mo-
ments she permitted her fiercely imagina-
tive mind to re-picture noel lying face
down in the wheel-rutted road near the
farmhouse at st meuve blood oozing from
the bullet hole in his breast there came
to her also a swift and terrible picture of
the german sniper brandenberg a white-
skinned thick-lipped beast crouching in the
clump of pines at the rear of the farm she
saw him approach noels supine figure with
plundering hands saw him place his still
smoking rifle on the ground to allow a
quick search of the victims pockets and
then a stealthy and rapid return to the pine-
shelter


short stories

  she was suddenly conscious of a waiter
standing beside her chair of a gilt-edge
menu held near for her consideration for
ten seconds she considered it with unseeing
eyes then slowly very slowly looked up into
the gargons face

  what is your name she inquired
steadily

  a wan smile creased his pallid features
his reply was soft and scarce audible
jacques monier mademoiselle i am at
your service

  her eyes fell again to the gilt-edged
menu there is a waiter here named wie-
gand he is a belgian if i remember right-
ly may i see him

  again the wan smile that reminded her
of a chinese mask and again the terrible
silence that left her stark still in her chair
with only the trumpet call of her mission
stirring her brain to life then after ages
it seemed the door opened a soft foot-
step fell near her chair she did not look
up because he was speaking

  mademoiselle has sent for me how
may i serve mademoiselle he moved
round the table and stood before her a wine
napkin outspread on his left arm he was
not more than eighteen with blonde eyes
and the face of a child she looked at him
again wonder and doubt striving in her
until her sobbing heart seemed to leap and
suffocate

  your name is louis brandenberg she
found voice to say you are a deserter
from the german army

  in a flash the waiters pose had gone he
was standing erect eyes illumined head
flung back then for an instant the child-
ish softness returned to his face a round
german tear welled in his blonde eyes

  mademoiselle spare me if i am
caught these english will shoot me have
pity mademoiselle

  her hand became clenched on the table
she had another flying picture of noel ly-
ing in the wheel-rutted track near the farm-
house you shot my husband at a place
called la vendee it was on the twentieth
of september he was attached to the med-
ical corps you will understand that i have
taken some trouble to find you

  he stared round-eyed at her and his
teutonic dismay left him slack-lipped and

gasping a little a sudden gleam of under-
standing lit his eyes the slack lips grew
suddenly tense

  madame you overwhelm me i was at
la vendee on the date you mention- i also
shot a red cross officer named lorimer

  you coward

  he flinched as though naked steel had
touched him but it was the action of one
unafraid of steel madame i crave your
pity and forgiveness

  you did not spare the seeker of the
wounded and the dead she taunted
from your cowards hiding place you
picked off the doctors the nurses the dy-
ing

  again he flinched but the serenity of the
unruffled child returned to his brow mad-
ame i found your husbands grave the day
after they brought him in some day you
will see the little white cross i put there
some day he went on with difficulty you
may see another near by it also has a
white cross it marks the resting place of
marie brandenberg my little alsatian wife
who lived with the santons at the farmhouse
at st meuve we had been married a year
the war called me away and marie went to
live with the santons my regiment moved
here and there until it brought me to la
vendee and only a little way over the hills
was the santons farm at st meuve my
heart was full of joy at the thought of see-
ing marie again

  he paused at the sound of footsteps in
the passage outside as though in fear of be-
ing disturbed after they had gone he con-
tinued speaking in a sharp undertone
when the french and english closed round
the farm the people of the district fled
marie stayed because she knew that i was
at la vendee and because the santons
knew that the french would not molest
them it was here marie met your husband
madame

  go on beatrice lorirrer had grown
ashen

  the blue of his eyes seemed to harden
although tne boyish tremor still stayed in
his voice he used to go to the farm-
house for fruit at first and the santons
gave him flowers for the hospital and fresh
miik for the wounded soldiers then your
husband began to see marie and write her
the sniper



letters they used to walk together in the
woods when he could steal an hour from his
work i was in the first line of trenches
beyond la vendee at the time my cor-
poral gave me word of marie occasionally
one day he asked if  would like to do
some sniping near the farm i told him
i would go well madame he hesitated
again while his right hand went to his inner
breast pocket with military suddenness we
have marie brandenbergs letters to noel
lorimer of the army medical corps i got
them from him after i had killed him you
may read them at your leisure madame
he cast a small war-soiled packet of let-
ters on the table before her

  there was a silence in which he almost
could hear the loud beating of her heart
her hand moved to the packet then as
if overcome by nausea she thrust them
aside

  he nodded but it was beatrice who
spoke first you judged them guilty was
all she said

  it was a long time before he answered
his breath came through his tight-shut
teeth his head was bent his chest heaved
some day madame you will read those
letters  pray you have pity on the two
jeople they concern-i pray you have pity
on them and me they said he was married
to a wife in england and i could not under-
stand why such a man should steal my love
from me the love that cried like a child in
my heart when i shot her in the woods at
la vendee

  beatrice stood up shaken to her depths
in the doorway she turned and looked back
t his sobbing shoulders god forgive
ou she said and almost ran from the
otel corridor into the street

here the hot sunlight stayed on her cheek
d cleared her throbbing senses it was
xme time before she recovered herself
vith half-seeing eyes she hailed a taxi and
rove to scotl u yard

  arriving she was shewn into a square
mgh-windowed apartment where sat the
chief superintendent of police he looked
up with a curious smile of recognition as
she entered pushing aside some papers
he indicated a chair briefly

  i had almost forgotten your case mlss
lorimer he said genially its almost a

month since you reported last do you like
your work

  immensely sir i have been engaged
on the troop case if you remember

  he regarded her flushed young face with
almost fatherly concern his brow creasing
in his effort to recall her case more clearly
each hour brought dozens of more or less
interesting problems to be solved and
sometimes the issues were confusing

  the troop gang have given us trouble
he stated pensively if i remember rightly
you undertook to impersonate a widow
whose husband had been shot by a german
sniper you invented a story and took it to
the international inquiry bureau troop
decided to put you in touch with the sniper
who sniped your non-existent husband did
he

  beatrice nodded they found an actor
sir who gave adequate reasons for sniping
a husband i did not possess and troop
took my check for two hundred guineas

  very briefly she related what had hap-
pened while the old chief lay back in his
chair tight-browed but inwardly chuckling
excellent excellent he broke out when
she had finished this louis brandenberg
is evidently an artist at the game we are
now in a position to jail the whole crowd for
fraud

  beatrice was thinking of the sobbing
shoulders the child-like eyes of the boy-
impostor whose acting was touched by the
salt of inward tears she was thinking of
the two graves at la vendee of the little
alsatian wife marie who never existed the
voice of the chief dispelled her mental
pictures

  wed better arrest troop at once miss
lorimer it will mean five years for him
and this louis brandenberg i congratulate
you this is your first scoop since you be-
came attached to the criminal investigation
department keep it up we need ladies
of your imaginative powers go home now
and rest you will hear from me this even-
ing

  beatrice returned to her little flat in
south kensington a feeling of weariness
and depression overcoming her after her
mornings work it had all seemed so real
so convincing but the chief had said her
work was good so nothing else mattered


short stories

  beatrice had few friends in life although
her parents had left her comfortably pro-
vided her restless nature craved for work
out of the beaten track she had gone to
the chief of police with a burning desire to
distinguish herself in the hunting down of
criminals the old chief had been very
patient and had assigned her one or two
unimportant missions connected with wo-
men and children her entry into the
troop case had revealed an amazing and
daring fraud

  late that evening troop was arrested
brandenberg was nowhere to be found
a fortnight later the disgusted chief re-
ceived the following note from beatrice
lorimer

    the riddle of the stones of flame
    by t w hanshew

       a trusted employee done to death behind locked
       and bolted doors an unimpeachable messenger set
       upon by thieves and robbed of the most precious
       output of a south african mine-a two-fold mystery
       solved by cleek one-time man of the forty faces

  if there is any spot in london more
famous in the history of precious
stones in general and diamonds in
particular than hatton garden that
place remains to be found for from
the time the jewels have been removed
from their native earth and clay and passed
through the hands of the various customs
officers hatton garden is their objective
there to be cut polished and set in diverse
ways and patterns till they are fit to grace
the throat of a queen the arm of a chorus
girl or to adorn the finger of the bride
to be

  it may be imagined therefore that it
came as something more than a shock to the
tenants of this vicinity when they arrived
on the scene of their labors to find that
grim tragedy had stalked into their midst
overnight and that not only had the most
famous diamonds in the world vanished like
dewdrops in the sun but the trusted man-
ager of one of the biggest firms had been
found stabbed to death in the office and
there were apparently no clues or even rea-
sons to account for this attack for the
stones had already left his charge ordi-
narily perhaps it might not have exerted
quite so much interest as it did in the public
rrm but for the peculiarly mystifying cir-
cumstanced and the fact that it crowned a
series of persistent jewel robberies which
had taken place in the same quarter for
many months past

  naturally scotland yard was caled into
action with the additional spur of n im-
lense reward from willis the senior part-
r of the firm and scotland yard res-
ided promptly by handing the case ovor
to cleek

  it is not only the reward which will
tempt you my dear fellow said the re-
doubtable superintendent narkom to his
famous lieutenant though it is a pretty
stiff one too but the whole thing is so in-
explicable-so full of perplexing points
that i myself am absolutely befogged over
it

  suppose you give me the history of it
then so  can put on my thinking cap a bit
beforehand said cleek settling himself
firmly in his chair you only said it was a
matter of diamond robbery over the phone
yes but robbery with a murder thrown
in at the other end there doesnt seem
much sense in murdering men after the
theft is committed still here goes

  the firm affected are messrs willis 
drew and as the senior partner stands to
lose  and the other leslie drew is
likely to be arrested for the murder you
can imagine what a case it is

  willis-drew echoed cleek do i
know them-names sound familiar too-
hm-no wait a minute dear old chap i
like to work things out for myself he
drew his brows down in a hard line and sat
thinking hard willis-drew-diamonds-
let me see its a mine i was thinking of
ah yes-the braganza mine-south africa
-werent they london agents for that par-
ticular mine said to be one of the big-
gest in kimberly-that is if they are the
hatton garden firm

  the identical people old chap said
narkom excitedly they do next to noth-
ing else now but polish and attend to the
output from that mine and are making their
fortune over it-despite the periodical rob-
beries


short stories

  whats that rapped in cleek sharply
periodical robberies what do you
mean

  well according to mr willis they have
had their messengers set upon and robbed
of one or two consignments of small stones
regularly every month and though the po-
lice have been called in nothing has been
discovered but now when it comes to a

question of the stones of flame-

  stones of flame-but heavens man
you dont mean that anything has happened
to those glorious stones do you

  you know them said narkom

  cleek sucked in his breath and nodded
vigorously

  know them he said who doesnt
why i remember when they were shown in
their natural state-uncut-at the imperial
institute-under special guards as a tribute
to our colony south africa and bought
finally by willy poel the south african
millionaire and now-stolen-but it is im-
possible-absurd

  not so impossible as you see cleek
returned mr narkom they were brought
to messrs willis  drew to polish and
set and as you can imagine theyve had a
pretty anxious time

  cleek nodded sympathetically

  i dont know whether you know their
offices  hatton garden its an old-
fashioned place and except for every door
and window being fitted with steel shut-
ters i dont believe a things been altered
since they took the place from wilfred sco-
bell himself

  cleek twitched an enquiring eyebrow
scobell had the place on a fifty years
lease explained the superintendent he
was a jewel cutter and dealer himself in a
small way but went bankrupt at the time of
the boer war however he was lucky
enough to be an old school friend of bob
willis-as one went down the other had
gone up-and willis like the splendid fel-
low he appears to be-took over scobells
rooms lock stock and barrel and installed
him as manager-practically you might
say making him a partner without the re-
sponsibility

  cleek nodded approvingly a jolly kind
act that he said warmly i hope to
goodness you are not going to tell me that

that man has betrayed his trust and bitten
the hand that saved him

  not he said narkom promptly ac-
cording to willis the man worshipped the
ground he walked on and he reproaches
himself bitterly for ever having entered into
partnership with drew instead of scobell
himself poor old chap-seems to have had
pretty hard luck

  gad man but dont tell me he is the
man murdered

  mr narkom nodded and cleek gave bent
to clicking sounds indicative of sympathetic
distress

  one of them that is supplement
narkom

  cleek spun round on his chair

  you see its like this continued mr
narkom hurriedly these precious stones
of flame as the natives called them proved
a heavy responsibility

  well scobell was in such a hurry to get
them off the premises that directly they
were finished he asked willis to send them
up to llandrindod wells where mr poel
was staying as soon as possible as they
seem to have been worried by the attacks
made on previous messengers young
drew was just about to start on his holidays
but he declared that he would take them
himself that very night catching the mail
train naturally this pleased both parties
and it appears that mr scobell packed the
stones in a steel-lined securely locked case
and gave them to mr drew before leaving
the office

  i suppose there isnt any doubt that he
did leave the office is there

  not the slightest for he came out with
drew himself mr willis having gone
earlier to a meeting

  the policeman on point duty can tell
you that he spoke to both men and as the
door had been shut and therefore auto-
matically locked it was impossible for
scobell to get back n-uc a sound was
heard by the police or night watchmen
nor is there any sign of disturbance on
the outer doors and how that man got in
without leaving a sign is an everlastinj
mystejry

  s urely he had his keys all he had to i

ws to come back and let himself in-

  for once old chap you are wrong that
the further adventures of cleek	

is just what he could not do for he had not
got the key the door is fitted with steel
panels and a special automatic lock for
which there are only two keys one for
each partner mr willis says they wanted
scobell to have one made for him but he
refused

  refused and why pray do they
know

  yes as it happens they do he was
afraid of the responsibility so the partners
used to take turns week by week to come
early so as to let the workmen the typist
and scobell himself into the office

  hum he might have borrowed mr
williss key

  no that is just what he did not do for
it was mr willis himself and the typist a
miss elsie carville who discovered the
tragedy when the office was opened up this
morning

  i see but what of mr willis himself
then  suppose his movements are well
authenticated

  perfectly he was at a public dinner at
the hotel cecil and didnt leave there till
hours after both the robberies and murders
took place besides it isnt likely that he
is going to tamper with stones of such no-
toriety as the stones of flame their loss
means utter ruin to him

  unless they were insured to very near
their full value

  hardly likely my dear chap the pre-
mium would be colossal even if any com-
pany would undertake it

  quite so quite so but robbing peter
to pay paul has been known to be done
unless of course-hum-it doesnt matter
tell me what happened to mr drew after
he went off with the stones of flame
young drew says that just as he was
leaving his chambers in jermyn street
bout ten oclock the jewel case locked up
in his portmanteau as he stepped out of the
dark doorway he received a crushing blow
on the back of his head which sent him
down like a nine-pin and when he did re-
cover consciousness naturally the thieves
had decamped stones and all a regular
clean sweep simplicity itself because as no
one knew they were outside of hatton gar-
den save three men no special precautions
had been taken to guard them

  hum and what happened after that
asked cleek tapping his fingers restlessly
on the chair i suppose drew rushed off
to the police station

  no thats just what the idiot didnt do
snapped mr narkom irritably

  he says he was so dazed and stunned by
the horror of the loss that he crawled up to
his own rooms and collapsed on the bed
his man was away having been given the
day anti night off as drew was going on
holiday

  the idiot the blithering idiot said
cleek softly unless it was a put-up job he
gave the men more time to get away  won-
der he pinched up his chin and rubbed it
gently with a soft hissing noise

  thats what i thought said narkom
bluntly but the lad he isnt much more
is so cut up i cannot believe it possible
however he did have the sense to tele-
phone to mr willis

  at what time did he commit that act of
sense rapped in cleek

  an hour later he thinks he says it
was a long time because his head hurt him
so anyway willis nearly had a fit when
he learned the news and so did the police
but next morning things were worse
when they reached hatton garden they
found outwardly the office was quite all
right but inside well its a regular pan-
demonium poor old scobell found stabbed
to death with a stiletto his blood all over
the table and chairs and what is more in-
credible another man a perfect stranger to
everybody as dead as a doornail lying just
within the door as if trying to get out
evidently he was poisoned but how and
why fair beats everybody in addition to
this young drew nearly died with the
shock he says for on the table was that
steel-lined casket empty as the proverbial
mother hubbards cupboard

  an interesting case at all events was
cleeks comment i suppose there is no
doubt regarding the room being impreg-
nable as it seems no other entrance or sli-
ding panel those old houses you know
are funny places

  not the slightest cleek the office is
at the top of the house and runs the entire
floor a barred window at each end fitted
with steel shutters similar to the single door


short stories

opening into it glass partitions have been
put up dividing the room into three sections
for the typist the jewel cutters and mr
williss private office as the room stands
on the side detached from the other build-
ings both walls are in fact solid brick
wynns passage a public right of way runs
between it and the wall is a solid unbroken
surface without a window from base to
roof there isnt a crevice big enough to
let a mouse through much less a man so
there it remains cleek

  just so my dear narkom suppose we
give our mr george headland a chance to
scratch his head over it personally i find
it very hard to believe that if only young
drew knew about those stones and had the
only key to the door-that story of a knock
on the head etc is very hard to swallow
but ill tell you more when ive had a
chance to look around a bit

  at hatton garden cleek found mr willis
to be a pleasant mannered and somewhat
sympathetic man in the early fifties who
well carried out mr narkoms belief as be-
ing exceptionally kindhearted and who
albeit his face bore traces of the anxiety
and distress under which he was laboring
was prepared to do his best to render every
assistance to the law

  mr drew on the other hand despite his
bandaged head and face drawn with pain
was striding up and down the room ob-
viously the outer and typists office with the
aspect of an enraged tiger cheated of its
prey

  for gods sake do something mr
headland he implored when mutual in-
troductions had been made i need hardly
tell you i am nearly crazy between the
physical and mental agony i am enduring
the loss of these stones means financial
ruin

  quite so agreed cleek solemnly and
as there is nothing spiteful people wont be-
lieve in these days there is every possi-
bility i suppose of you yourselves being
accused of having had a hand in it

  good heavens what rot flung back the
young man heatedly

  in what possible way put in willis
with a shade of contempt could i or my
partner benefit by the robbery

  well said cleek scratching his head

dismally there is the matter of insurance
dont you know cost a colossal premium
but if only one payment had been made and
then the stones gone well thats the line of
reasoning do you follow me

  i certainly do so but happily for our
reputation though not for our pocket said
mr willis pompously such a line cannot
be taken for in consequence of having a
patent time-lock safe steel-shuttered doors
and windows we considered it would be a
waste of money to pay such a high premium
as would naturally be demanded and so did
not enter into any assurance at all the
loss therefore is solely and entirely ours
that they will be recovered i havent the
slightest hope but i want to clear my part-
ner here from any possible ill save the loss
of his and my fortune

   b gad it is hard lines said cleek see-
ing here a possible rung drop out of a
possible ladder and forthwith puckering
up his brow and doing a bit of hard think-
ing

  to their surprise he turned and walked
up the room pausing on the threshold of
the room in the front of the building where
his concern seemed more bent on the furni-
ture then on the bodies of the murdered
men and beyond a superficial glance in the
direction where the bodies lay-those of an
elderly man and a young one of about
twenty-and a word of surprise regarding
the condition of one of them he appeared
to give them not a second thought but
that word of surprise was in itself signifi-
cant

  hullo he said in an easy off-hand sort
of manner that nodding to the figure
of the elder man is mr scobell i presume
was he going to a meeting too or was
he in the habit of wearing evening dress in
the daytime i thought you told me he
came away with mr drew

  so he did said that gentleman quickly
thats another of the mysteries of this
affair first time i ever knew old scobell
possessed a dress suit much less seen him
in one and what possessed him to dress
himself up like that and come back to this
hole to say nothing of how he got in with-
out attracting attention heaven alone
knows

  heaven knows many things replied
the further adventures of cleek	

cleek oracularly as he went on doing what
he called poking about while mr drew
was speaking perhaps heaven knows
too why he brought a bottle of champagne
with him and got out the glasses whats
that mr narkom how do i know it was
champagne why look at the champagne
glasses for one thing to say nothing of
this he pounced on two or three shining
bits of tin-foil see part of the capsule
evidently he had poured it out and hidden
the bottle away havent found a cham-
pagne bottle i suppose he wheeled
round on mr drew who was listening to
him with open eyes and mouth

  i didnt it was willis who opened up
he turned to his partner who shook his head
solemnly

  cleek stood at the table and picked up
one of the glasses and examined it closely
sniffing at it vigorously and holding it up
to the light

  these belong to you mr willis he
asked abruptly

  it was drew however who answered the
question

  probably belong to the cafs vilano
italian ice cream shop opposite send us in
a meal occasionally when we stay late

  hm i see cleek walked over to the
steel-barred window and looked down on
the little restaurant designated by drew as
an ice cream shop it was of the usual
italian variety with the unappetizing sight
of a couple of tired-looking chops gar-
nished by stale tomatoes and flanked by two
mitre-folded serviettes in the window

  probably brought them up with him
said drew

  probably said cleek cut across mr
narkom will you and ask whether they
sold a customer a bottle of champagne with
the loan of two glasses

  mr narkom cut across accordingly and
cleek replacing the glass on the table as if
it held no further attraction for him walked
back into the outer office

  is this the only room belonging to you
he asked mr willis who was watching him
covertly and evidently not highly impressed
by his manner

  yes he replied as you see it is all
one big room divided off by thick sound-
proof glass partitions the workroom is at

the back my office is at the front and
miss carville the typist works in here
there is only one door or outlet

  ah yes said cleek i see that is
her hat i presume pointing to a large hat
crowned with a wreath of poppies hanging
behind the door and where is the young
lady by the way on her holiday

  why of course not said mr drew
quickly poor little girl she was so over-
come by the horror of it all that when i
came i got the key of the empty office
downstairs and bundled her down machine
table and all i wouldnt have had her given
such an upset for worlds

  he spoke so warmly that cleek his head
cocked on one side for all the world like an
attentive terrier who sees a rat stared at
him fixedly

  ah yes he said thats her machine
going now isnt it he walked to the door
and opened it listening attentively to the
click-click of the machine below ah he
smiled knowingly a beginner i see not
very high speed uses her first and second
finger more than her fourth does a lot of
rubbing out too eh

  he came back and looked humorously at
the waste-paper basket already half filled
with badly typed unfinished letters

  mr willis frowned yes she is not
very satisfactory and i should have dis-
charged her at the end of last week if poor
scobell had not interfered we had to re-
place our miss brendon who was taken ill
a fortnight ago but really mr headland

this is sheer waste of time-

  im very interested in typewriting said
cleek serenely sort of fellow-feeling
dont you know thought of taking it up
myself at one time i wonder what school
she learned at ah well letshave a look
at the other room whats that mr willis
nothing touched there its the bodies that
are the chief shouldnt like to say that
but theres plenty of time to examine them
my friend they wont run awy ah here
is mr narkom well my friend

  a miss dear old chap havent got a
license for wines and mantonelli the pro-
prietor says mr scobell never went near
the place yesterday hes in an awful way
one of his waiters hasnt turned up and hes
as short-tempered as hes short-handed


short stories

  ah well never mind  want to have a
few words with miss carville please be-
fore going further

  he did it was not more than a minute
before young drew hurrying down the
stairs returned in company with a young
lady as slight and petite in figure as mr
drew was tall and from the protective
glances he bestowed on her it was pretty
obvious to less observant eyes than those
of cleeks that mr drew like mr scobell
was willing to overlook many of miss car-
villes typing mistakes for the sake of her
company

  that she possessed more than the modi-
cum of good looks was undeniable large
dark languishing eyes glanced timidly from
beneath golden brown lashes which con-
trasted strongly with the masses of bright
gold-colored hair piled up in elaborate puffs
and coils and rolls that showed it to evident
advantage her slight figure was clad in a
black poplin gown but she looked such a
lady of birth and breeding that had it not
been for the violet stains of typewriting ink
cleek would not have been surprised had
mr willis introduced her as his daughter

  her voice too was very low and musical
as she answered the questions put to her
by mr headland who stood looking out of
dull bewildered eyes undoubtedly as much
befogged as mr narkom himself

  she was horribly nervous and horribly
frightened as was natural under the cir-
cumstances but she told her story plainly
and straightforwardly and with a glance of
pity every now and then turned to the next
room

  i am told miss carville said cleek
that you were the first to catch sight of the
dead men can you give me the exact po-
sitions

  i think i can sir she said it was so
horrible i came in here first with mr
willis as usual-took up my notebook and
went to his room while mr willis himself
looked into the workroom i pushed open
the door and there was a heavy weight
against it it was one of them i only caught
sight of mr scobell he was in the chair-
then the blood and i shrieked and shrieked
and shrieked she broke off shudderingly

  quite so said cleek quite so and
did you know mr scobell at all outside of

the office he asked with startling irrele-
vance

  miss carville looked honestly surprised
as well she might and mr drew advanced
almost threateningly but evidently reas-
sured by the young ladys quickly answered
negative

  certainly not she said haughtily i
never saw mr scobell in my life till i came
here nor after i left the office at night
her dark eyes flashed dangerously and her
voice became startlingly loud and grim

  no offense miss im sure said cleek
humbly just a thought of mine i dont
think you can tell me any more miss
seems to me a corker of a case right
through

  at a word from mr willis the girl with-
drew and a minute later could be heard
the clicking of the typewriter

  nice girl that said cleek approvingly
pity shes so untidy he stooped and
picked up a bit of typing paper fallen from
her skirt and throwing it presumably in the
waste-paper basket it must be said pre-
sumably for as he turned and swooped
down on that useful article it could only be
for that purpose

  and now with your kind permission
mr willis we will have a detailed look at
our dead friends inside there i havent
given them due attention yet because i be-
gin to see a grave error has been made in
the cause of death of mr scobel at any
rate

  an error mr headland said mr wil-
lis pompously and facing round on him
how can you say that when you havent
so much as looked at either of the two poor
fellows as for my poor old friend youll
be telling me next that he wasnt stabbed
to death even though the weapon is stick-
ing in him right under our very eyes

  but eyes are very easily deceived mr
willis retorted cleek placidly as a
matter of fact id rather trust my nose than
my eyes any day in detecting a crime and
if anybody tells you theres nothing but
violets when you distinctly smell musk it
gives you to think as our french friends
say

  it was not a pleasant sight for a dead
man with a stiletto sticking in him is by no
means one conducive to calm ones nerves
the further adventures of cleek	

and in addition there seemed to be a sur-
prising amount of blood on the table and
chairs

  but cleek mystified mr willis even more
by leaning over and sniffing the dead mans
mouth and hair then with thumb and fore-
finger parting the half-closed lids a sharp
sound broke from his lips and turning on
his heel he switched over to that of the
younger man evidently of foreign birth-
either swiss or italian

  a little satisfied laugh from cleek caused
mr willis to frown even more heavily

  gentleman rapped out cleek i have
the honor to inform you of two positive
facts first and foremost that scobell was
killed hours before this man and second
that if that stiletto had been a sword it
could not have done what it is supposed to
have done since he was already dead at
the time

  good lord began mr narkom and
mr drew in one breath but cleek checked
them with a wave of his hand

  why he has been killed i cannot quite
see though i have an idea but the facts re-
main that he died from poisoning all this
stuff here is so much good red ink cyanide
of potassium was the material used judg-
ing by the contents of that glass given to
him in that glass of champagne - by
whom 

  why by that young joker over there of
course interposed young drew quickly
who else could it be he must have been
in here after scobell and i left that was
after the policeman downstairs saw the
light in the window

  he was right after all

ill

  had a bombshell been thrown into their
midst there could not have been caused
onsternation and one and all gazed
at	 man in open-mouthed aston-

ishm

 l	ed mr willis sharply

lights our window nonsense man
you are mad you forget the steel shutters
how could any light shine through them

  yes thats what scobell told him we
lad just come down the stairs dont you
know and the policeman was just coming
up to ask if everything was all right

  well im blest said cleek a queer lit-
tle smile traveling up one side of his face

  tell me he turned suddenly on the
two members of the firm were you in the
workroom or your own office when you de-
cided to send off the stones of flame
here in this room was the prompt re-
ply but the shutters were down-and no
one could possibly have seen through them
we packed them here at least poor sco-
bell did at the desk directly after

  hm-i see said cleek walking aim-
lessly round and round the room his gaze
fixed now on the ceiling then on the skirt-
ing till not a square inch of space had es-
caped his eyes he came to rest at last
before the window and tested for himself
the steel shutter which rolled up automatic-
ally making the window almost hermetically
sealed by the weight of the metal

  very clever idea that was his comment
approvingly but i say what about when
you open the window in the daytime

  it never was opened said mr willis
it is fastened up-poor scobells idea-he
was simply crazed on keeping the diamonds
safe and yet as sure as fate as a new con-
signment has gone out this last three
months the messenger has been waylaid
and robbed in one case we sent two men
of unimpeachable honesty and both men
were laid out by men waiting at the bottom
of hatton garden it is absolutely un-
canny

  kind of second sight eh jerked in
cleek turning on his heels suddenly and
continuing his prowl round the room

  ah he stooped suddenly at the side of
the big roll-top desk you packed your dia-
monds in sawdust eh mr willis

  good heavens no man said that ex-
asperated gentleman of course not the
very finest cotton-wool

  ah my mistake flung back cleek still
in a stooping posture his hand supported
against the panel of the desk suddenly a
little cry escaped him and he put his hand
suddenly to his back

  lord but ive done it again

  done what again asked young drew
solicitiously

  cricked my back was the reply give
me a hand up again will you mr narkom
ah thanks old friend as the superintend-


short stories

ent complied readily enough well that
settles this place he said casually all
we have to do is to find out who the other
young gentleman is and there you are
dont you know

  there he certainly was and as fate took
the case into her hands she supplied the
answer to that part of the riddle by the sud-
den appearance of a stout and greasy ital-
ian clad in the conventional dress-suit and
apron beloved of his class panting and
anxious he stood at the door left open by
miss carville

  why mantonelli exclaimed both part-
ners in a breath and as cleek noted the fur-
tive look and stertorous breathing of the
proprietor of the ice-cream shop he grew
very very still

  signor  cam to ask you ze fafor ze
greatest favor to look at heem ah yes
but it ees heem he shrieked for his gaze
had wandered past to the figure of the
dead young italian also in evening dress
and it did not need his exclamation of gus-
tave it ees heem to tell cleek the iden-
tity of the dead stranger

  he ask me all of a sudden for what you
inglis call ze night off  thought heem
gone mad i say non-but he disappear
suddenly in ze evening-and he is ere-
dead what does it mean signors

  mean ill tell you what it means gen-
tlemen to-night or ill eat my hat said
cleek his eyes glittering with excitement
mr mantonelli i want a dinner prepared
for six-thirty sharp the very finest dinner
you can prepare for me whats that for
how many ill tell you when i see the
menu never mind the expense throw
your whole staff and soul into it and ill
come over and choose the wine myself off
you go

  the italian needed no further word-with
a flourish of his greasy apron he was gone
leaving cleek with a twisted little smile on
his face

  gentlemen im going to ask you for
both your keys so as to keep this room shut
and perhaps you wouldnt mind going down
and asking miss carville if she will want
any more paper or anything else from this
room till i come back

  any ideas old chap asked narkom
anxiously directly the door closed on the

two partners who straightway began a quest
for another office

  bushels was the laconic reply some-
times a hair will show which way the wind
blows old chap and when it blows in the
right direction the mills of fate grind ex-
ceedingly small trot off and find that
clever young policeman for me and if you
can keep our friends downstairs out of the
way for a few minutes i may be able to
give mr willis the surprise of his life

  mr narkom seeing that no further infor-
mation was forthcoming departed on his
quest and succeeded in keeping both part-
ners in hot argument over the fact of being
turned out of their own office even for the
short space of half a day

  the natural demand however of miss
carville for her hat on the clock striking
the lunch hour of one precluded any fur-
ther delay but when mr willis opened the
door of the office it was to find mr george
headland deeply engaged in making his
stubbly hair before a piece of looking-glass
and surveying his reflection with undoubted
self-satisfaction

  he glanced up at their entry unabashed
by mr willis unspoken contempt or miss
carvilles giggle quickly repressed as she
reached down her poppy-crown hat

  ah going out to lunch miss carville
he remarked jauntily swinging a little back
as that young lady swept by him haughtily
and ran downstairs

  whats that mr willis discovered any-
thing did you say yes ive discovered
that im jolly hungry and ive got to go
downstairs before i can come upstairs
again ha ha he gave an inane little
giggle

  we detectives must have our little joke
no my friend theres nothing more to dis-
cover now ill come at six oclock thats
it shut the door thank you gentlem-
hoping you wont be greatly incr	d

now we shant be long	mr

narkom if you please 	get

back to scotland yard

  with a little wave of the key the com-
panion to which he had given the dazed
superintendent cleek lurched down the
narrow stairs out onto the pavement and
was round the corner before mr willis
could draw breath
the further adventures of cleek	

  the distance which lies between that part
of hatton garden where the building oc-
cupied by messrs willis and drew stood
and scotland yard is one easily walkable
in fact a man might have no difficulty in
covering the ground in something under
half an hour it was then rather remarka-
ble that it was nearly two hours later be-
fore any sign was heard from cleek at that
historic building where mr narkom waited
in vain and then it was in the form of an
urgent telephone call for petrie

  had any one been listening they would
have been perhaps more mystified than en-
lightened by the conversation which took
plzce for petrie was soon heard to say six
be enough sir i can let you have more-
as easy as wink-eight sir yessir in plain
clothes yessir i understand surround the
place and bag every one-righto sir

  perhaps too if anyone had seen the
the beery corduroyed navvy who lounged
into the little oilshop in hatton garden and
after buying some candles and matches to
say nothing of a specimen of a special line
of screw-dri vers might have been forgiven
if they did not recognize in him the smart
young inspector who appeared later on be-
half of the electric light company and
walked into the caf vilano with a demand
to see the electric light meters

  as all the staff were evidently hard at
work in the kitchen cooking and preparing
for the dinner of their lives it was not sur-
prising that the inspector had to find the
meters for himself and accordingly pro-
ceeded strangely enough to look for them
in every corner of the place

  even when he did find them he must
have taken a tremendous time over them
for it was fully half an hour before he
emerged and walked up the street with a
smart young policeman on the beat who

   nearer promotion than he had ever
been in all his life

  what cleek did with his time after that
will never be known but even if mr nar-
kom had seen him up at the great post of-
fice being initiated into the mystery of the
morse dash and dot telegraphic system he
would only have been still more mystified
sufficient to say that at six oclock when it
was just getting dark up in the office where
mr narkom with miss carville downstairs

typing most energetically at her post sat
anxiously waiting for him cleek walked in

  ah mr narkom hope i havent kept
you waiting was his greeting im
awfully sorry old chap but i havent had
time to take in the wine list to old manton-
elli opposite youll just have time to get
them on ice for me-here it is

  he detached a leaf of his note-book
which the superintendent took off with him
while cleek without so much as by your
leave sat down at the desk fidgetting rest-
lessly with his feet all of which did not
tend to allay the irritation of the partners
thus set at naught

  another minute he gave a twitch of the
head and a scrap of a laugh as mr nar-
kom came tumbling into the room

  right was i asked cleek screwing
round in his chair and looking at the super-
intendent

  i should think you were you said
diamonds leaving to-night

  good man purred cleek

  in the name of all that is mysterious
began mr drew but was suffered to go no
further than that

  cleek by way of a change interjected
the owner of that name no reason now
that you should not know it

  cleek the two partners spoke as one
man drew finishing with a devout thank
heaven-the only man in the world for this
job

  at your service gentlemen he replied
mr willis many thanks for the reward
im going to win it within the next three
minutes

  good lord man you dont mean to tell
me that you know who stole my precious
stones or who murdered my best friend

  to both questions yes my dear sir
come here walk softly all three of you
and dont make a sound sufficient to wake
a cat then as they followed him in silent
amazement he led them to the door from
outside in the street there arose oaths and
screams that one might well have thought
a fire had broken out in the windows of the
cafe vilano

  come on come on said cleek in a
swift sharp whisper and beckoning them
to follow bore down onto the landing here
they found miss carville evidently flust-


short stories

ered by the noise with both hands clasped
on the rail she was leaning over evidently
straining to catch the cause of the noise and
trouble

  what is it whats the rumpus sang
out cleek as he reached her side

   dont know sir she gave back trem-
ulously all at once i heard it what
does it mean she glanced hurriedly up
at him

  merely that your little game is up my
friend rapped in cleek reaching over so
quickly that before she could unlock her
fingers from the bannister rail a steel band
was snapped round each slender wrist and
those hands were helplessly locked together
got you you infernal scoundrel look
sharp there mr narkom there may be a
knife in her skirt i know the beauties
thats it i thought so played sir played
thats got her yes leave the rest to petrie
and hammond bring this little beast up
here

  it was but a minute later and the claw-
ing biting curse-spitting figure of miss car-
ville was securely bound onto the chair
while the partners were peppering cleek
with questions and all the tenants of the
neighboring houses and offices were piling
into the street to witness what was practi-
cally the wholesale arrest of every inhabi-
tant of the cafe vilano

  cleek shut the door on the din content
to leave it to his subordinates

  then he turned onto his prisoner who
had sunk down sobbing so piteously that it
was evident young drew would be likely to
set her free

  stop that row jules borelle flung out
cleek while a cry of sheer amazement
burst forth from the rest

  did you think cleek was going to for-
get that wonderful transformation made for
margot herself lets see what you filled
it with this time

  leaning over he gave a switch a pull
and in his hand was the becoiled and elab-
orate wig leaving a fair and smooth-haired
young frenchman of about three-and-
twenty -

  regardless of the hubbub cleeks fingers
twined restlessly in the hair and he gave a
little yap of delight as he pulled out a little
wad of cotton-wool

  well im dashed said young drew
then gave a sudden howl a sudden cheer
and flung his arms round mr willis as one
after another there came forth the missing
stones of flame

  it was half an hour later the italian pris-
oners had been carted away and with them
jules borelle and cleek and narkom stood
in the office

  want to know how i discovered the
trick said cleek answering the query put
to him by mr willis as that gentleman
dried the check made out for one thousand
pounds payable to hamilton cleek

  why it was quite easy to see that a
womans hatpin couldnt have made all that
mess even if it was blood which it wasnt

  hatpin rang out mr drew

  yes hatpin my friend and its twin was
in that poppy-wreathed hat eyes are also
useful i admit mr willis when i smelled
the cyanide and found traces of sawdust
near that desk to say nothing of a golden
hair clinging to it i knew who had been
concerned in the murder and who had come
from the cafe vilano to do it no it wasnt
gustave he came up later and found the
other man dead and to pull himself to-
gether finished that glass it was a false
step on the part of mantonelli not to recog-
nize his own glasses

  yes but how did they get in asked
mr drew

  oh very simply-ill show you-shut
the door on me a minute

  cleek lurched out of the room there
was complete silence broken a minute or
two later by a click and a low laugh they
turned in time to see cleek coming through
the side of the roll-top desk

  that leads down to the wine-cellar op-
posite he said calmly mantonelli want-
ed to put any blame on to gustave that 
why he came up to see what was going to
happen i kept him too busy for the rest
of the day to do any harm

  i dont understand what you meant just
now by those diamonds said drew

  ah that was a clever trick look-

he stooped and pulled hard at the carpet be-
low the desk beneath which showed a rod
and wire

  that connected to a battery and two
the further adventures of cleek	

lamps let into the top of that window my
friend-dot and dash messages were sent
out to the watchers opposite and there you
are

 by whom-miss car-i mean-

  no said cleek sadly scobell was the
traitor he had these rooms fitted up for
that purpose but he was taken in too by
our handsome miss carville and sent her
notes-this one she dropped he was to
have shown her or given her the stones of
flame that night he put false stones in
your precious casket keeping the real ones

back young borelle probably took them
poisoned scobell and walked out when
gustave came up with the casket which
they had just broken open and found noth-
ing for their pains he found our friend
dead the rest is simple and if borelle had
only decamped instead of using the wig as a
hiding place all would have been well as it
is thank you for the check mr willis
take my advice unscrew that window and
then do business as usual

  he turned and clattered down the stair-

who seemed to be particularly uncomfortable they were not undergoing any especial

these oh thats just a little joke i have he replied in perfect good humor

inside the cabin

by george hyde preston

author of the conscience of mccann

how an unjustly punished klondikers sweet revenge turned
bitter within his mouth and a better thing took its place

ig bill garvin opened the
 door of his cabin and stepping
 out picked up an armful of
 wood

  the night was snapping cold
the moon was rising from behind a ridge
of decolate hills

  its some sharp said garvin better
than thirty below i guess he was talking
to himself men do that when they are
alone in alaska it helps keep off the op-
pression of the vast silence that broods
over the north

  he turned back into the cabin with the
wood and shut the door against the icy air
that came rushing in after him

  filling up the firebox of the yukon stove
he went on cooking his supper i wonder
what the boys is doing up at the old camp
he muttered it wasnt no particular fault
of theirs i would have voted the same
way likely the gold was found in my
cabin all right the miners meeting de-
cided fair enough in driving me out of the
camp considering the evidence it was him
that fooled them to save his own skin he
knowed how the poke came to be in my

bunk damn him ill-

  the smoke of scorching bacon rose in
garvins face and made him cough

  i hadnt ought to think of him when i am
trying to cook he muttered when i
does i forgets everything else

  he set the frying pan on the back of the
stove and opened the door to let the smoke
out of the cabin before he closed it
again he turned his face up river and said
like a man who is repeating some familiar
ritual let me live long enough to kill him
thats all i ask

  he closed the door finished cooking his
meal and put it on the rude table which
was lighted by a candle stuck through a
hole in the bottom of an empty can turned
upside down

  he had drawn up his chair and was pour-
ing a cup of coffee when he heard a crunch-
ing on the snow outside the cabin and tnen
a sound as though some one had fallen
against the door

  hello whos there come in he
called

  there was a moments fumbling at the
latch string then the door opened and a
man covered with frost staggered across the
threshold and sank to the floor

  im-all in-and starved gasped the
man in short jerks for gods sake-give

me- he stopped suddenly and stared

up at garvin from under his frost whitened
eyebrows you

  garvin leaped for his rifle that hung on
the wall back of his bunk

  yes its me shorty hinds he said
i was just speaking about you he went
on in a deadly even tone i was just say-
ing that i was going to kill you garvins
lips writhed a little as he spoke and his
teeth shone white in the candle light like
those of a snarling animal

  the man on the floor gazed at him
dumbly

  garvin put the rifle to his shoulder held
it so for a breathless instant and then low-
ered it with a baffled oath its too much
like shooting a poisoned rat the way you
are now he exclaimed ive got to wait

  you might as well shoot now gasped
the man im near dead anyhow i cant
go-no further they are close behind
-theyll soon be here-and then-  v-v

  so theres more than me wants to shoot
you put in garvin grimly

  shoot no a note of scorn came
into hinds weak voice theres a marshal
up at the old camp now-and law they
dont want to shoot me-they wants-to
catch me-and-send me-outside-to the

pen-they- his voice trailed off into

mumbling his head fell forward on his
inside the cabin



breast he rolled limply over on the floor
unconscious

  clean beat out commented garvin
looking down at the huddled body without a
trace of pity in his face

  as he spoke there came a sound of yelp-
ing from up river

  dog team exclaimed garvin starting
up by god theyre coming now

  he gripped his rifle and looked at the
man on the floor with hating eyes then he
shook his head no  cant do it i cant
shoot a man that aint on his feet not
even him but i aint going to miss my
chance he exclaimed fiercely i wont
let them take him he aint never going
out of this cabin alive

  garvin glanced swiftly around the room
what will i do where will  hide him
they will look in the bunk and under it
sure his eye fastened on a big sack
made of brown canvas that hung empty on
the wall one that he used as a cover for
his sleeping-bag when he was on the trail
he jerked it down

  the sawed-off cuss will go into it easy
ive got to work quick that there dog
team is coming along fast

  opening the sack garvin pulled it up
around the form of the unconscious man
and with a quick upward jerk settled the
limp body down into it then dragging
the sack to the middle of the floor he
shoved some clothes into the open end
leaving a woolen shirt sticking part way out
and threw down a jumper and some flannels
near by as though he were unpacking

  they wont never think of looking for
him in a sack lying in plain sight in the mid-
dle of the floor muttered garvin if he
was to come to in there and struggle like
there would be things doing but ill have to
take a chance on that

      ut his ear to the door and listened
      almost here he ejaculated

 i o s l uni mccoys voice cussmg the
dogs

  he hastily hung up his rifle on the wall
back of the bunk and sliding into his chair
was eating when they knocked at the door

  come in he called

  four men entered garvin knew them
all they had been his friends once

  he met them with a scowl

  what do you want he demanded
what are you coming down here for
aint you done enough driving me out of
the camp do you want to do me more
dirt say you mccoy he exclaimed
turning savagely on one of the men what
do you want

  nothing of you garvin returned mc-
coy we didnt know you was here or
where you was we want shorty hinds for
-for good reasons he is heading down
river has he been here

  as he spoke mccoy gave a swift search-
ing glance around the cabin

  been here snarled garvin do you
know how long he would last if he was
standing where you are now just till i
could reach for that gun garvin made a
fierce gesture toward the rifle hangin on
the wall

  mccoy nodded i guess thats right
he agreed shorty sure did give you away
pretty bad he added as he stepped around
the canvas sack

  garvin glanced down involuntarily the
sack appeared to him to move a little of
course it didnt he told himself tom
just stirred it with his foot

  come boys said mccoy sharply we
must be moving shorty is ahead of us
yet but he cant last forever without grub
we are bound to get him he maybe
knowed that this wasnt a healthy place for
him to stop and is making for dago petes
roadhouse ten miles or so down the river
joe is the kind that would help him out and
ask no questions if shorty would come
down liberal with some of the dough he is
getting away with well so long garvin
sorry to have broke in on you unceremo-
nious like

  the others nodded curtly as they filed out
garvin held the door open a crack and
watched them as they went down the trail at
a swinging gait

  they think that i am a thief he mut-
tered through his set teeth as he closed the
door they think that i am a thief and
all because of him with a look of hate at
the sack

  garvin took a quick stride and seizin
the sack by the bottom gave it a fierce jerk
that dumped hinds out on to the floor
where he lay sprawling queerly


short stories

  i wonder if he is dead thought gar-
vin of course he aint he scoffed
snakes like him aint so easy killed whisky
will bring him around

  garvin lifted him from the floor and put-
ting him on the bunk trickled a little
whisky between his lips

  hinds gasped stirred and opened his
eyes

  take some more said garvin raising
him up and putting the bottle to his lips
hinds took an eager gulp then he stared
at garvin i thought you was going to
shoot me he said

  i am returned garvin grimly as soon
as you can stand up do you want some
grub

  hinds gazed at the food on the table with
famished eyes

  im starved he muttered

  well there it is go to it

  hinds put his feet unsteadily to the floor
and staggering to the table fell upon the
food like an animal and groveled over it
swallowing in great gulps like a famished
dog finally he was satisfied and gave a
long sigh of repletion he blinked stupidly
at the candle light for a moment or so then
his head nodded heavily and fell forward
among the dishes

  asleep ejaculated garvin or is he
playing foxy get up he cried shaking
hinds shoulder

  the man stirred muttered and settled
back

  all in nodded garvin dead to the
world ive got to wait till he wakes up

  garvin took some blankets and spread-
ing them out on the floor rolled hinds up
in them then he sat down on his bunk
and watched the sleeping man gloomily
clean beat out couldnt wake him with
a cannon but to-morrow morning it will
be different and then-

  after a time garvins head nodded he
started up with a jerk and stared wildly at
the sleeping man

  hes there all right but suppose i go to
sleep and he wakes up-and gets away

  garvin passed his hand nervously over
his face whats the use of being such a
durned fool he ejaculated irritably why
not settle it right now he glanced at the
rifle and then at the sleeping man and

shook his head i cant do it that way
ill watch him till he wakes up

  and through the long hours of the arctic
night garvin at times moving restlessly
about and at times sitting motionless on
his bunk kept his vigil and watched the
sleeping man with gloomy implacable eyes
lighting a fresh candle when the old one
burned away

  at last the man on the floor woke up and
blinked at his enemy sitting on the bunk

  i thought i was eating something he
said reaching out confusedly with his
hand

you was-last night returned garvin
last night oh yes last night pears
like ive had a sleep maybe im dreaming
yet i thought you was going to shoot me
i am-now cut in garvin get up
aint you going to give me no show
muttered hinds

  what show did you give me back up
there exclaimed garvin putting his hand
on the rifle hanging behind him

  if i aint going to have no chance why
didnt you plug me when i was asleep
sneered hinds you might just as well
why didnt you

  garvin hesitated for a moment then he
burst out with an oath because that would
a made it too easy for you i want you to
know that i am killing you i want you to
see it coming get up

  hinds half rose and then pitched forward
with a startled cry

  none of that foxy game get up
quick now ordered garvin fiercely

  hinds clutched at his right leg and
pressed his fingers into it without speaking
then he beat it with his fist there aint
no feeling in it he said huskily its
dead like

  get up repeated garvin

  i cant hinds voice was 
scream its dead i tell you
bill he besought maybe it  was to
move a little it would come all right
garvin took his hand off the gun and
stepping forward lifted hinds to his feet

  let me put my hand on your shoulder
bill and ill try to take a step

  there was a moments pause suddenly
the hand on garvins shoulder thrust him
violently back and hinds sprang like a
inside the cabin



panther for the rifle snatched it from the
wall and turned it upon garvin

  youre easy bill he jeered ill do
the shooting myself from now on his
eyes narrowed got anything you want to
say before i begin

  garvin looked straight into the crafty
face behind the gun his eyes alive with
hate no i aint you thief why dont
you shoot

  dont be in such a hurry to have a hole
blowed through you sneered hinds ive
got something to say myself first but it
wont take long

  garvin stood silent

  that was a smooth trick you turned on
the boys from up river

  garvin stared

  i come to like you see grinned hinds
and i heard some of your pow-wow with
em

  garvin said nothing

  unintentional of course went on
hinds you done me a pretty good turn
seeing how things has turned out and that
there meal afterward tasted pretty fine
even if it was kind of like fattening me up
the way they does hogs before the killing
he said with a wry smile

  garvins mouth twitched how long are
you going to keep this up he demanded
why dont you shoot and have done with
it

 im going to-right now snapped
hinds

  he raised the rifle to his shoulder

  because of what i have just men-
tioned he went on deliberately i am
going to shoot-like this and suddenly
jerking up the rifle he fired through the
roof of the cabin

  garvin stared confusedly what the
devil are you-

  that was a pretty poor shot put in
hinds coolly see if you can better it
catch and with a reckless laugh he
tossed the rifle into garvins hands

  garvin gripped the weapon convulsively
he looked up at the roof and then at the
man in front of him his face working he
half pointed the rifle at hinds hesitated
and then with a sudden fierce oath sent it
crashing through the window

  hinds jeering laugh filled the cabin i
knowed my play would spike your gun
thats the kind of a durned fool you are
thats what i figgered on well ive got to
mush bill im in some of a hurry tell
the boys i enjoyed hearing their kind re-
marks concerning me even if i wasnt in
shape to come out and say howdy to em
so long

  the door closed on shorty hinds mock-
ing face

  garvin stood motionless staring straight
before him his eyes full of impotent hate
why didnt he shoot me he muttered
through his clenched teeth id rather he
had the sneaking thief figgered right i
cant do nothing he spiked my gun good
and plenty he has given me my life i
cant never kill him now
