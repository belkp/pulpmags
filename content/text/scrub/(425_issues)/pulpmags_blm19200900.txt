chapter i
the limousine drew up beside the
curb a correctly garbed chauf-
feur leaped from his seat opened
the door and stood stiffly at at-
tention as j sylvester jones stepped
out jones was garbed in a manner
that should have made the lilies of the
field blush with shame at their shabbi-
ness from thirty-dollar hat to forty-
dollar shoes he was impeccable
  you may wait hawker he said in
a tone that meant hawker i gracious-
ly give you permission to continue liv-
ing
  he separated a key from the others
on his ring and languidly ascended the
steps of strickland guerneys ornate
house it was coming on to dusk and
the great hall was almost dark jones
switched on the light and looked about
curiously
  bradley he called
  a round shouldered misty eyed little
butler came pattering from somewhere
in the rear of the house
  i am astonished at this carelessness
bradley reproved jones where are
the servants
  ah mr sylvester sir im glad
youve come the old butler pointed
a skinny shaking hand toward the ceil-
ing somethings wrong mr sylves-
ter i know it in my bones
wrong what could be wrong
this morning your uncle told all the
servants to take the day off i was
feeling rather badly sir and i retired
to my room where i stayed until noon
i went to his study then and knocked
but he would not answer later i tried
the door two or three times but could
get no response
  nonsense said jones sharply
what could be wrong youre too
old to display the nerves of a chest-
nut street flapper bradley ill go
upstairs with you and well rouse
up the old curmudgeon probably
he went to sleep counting his bank-
books
  together they ascended the wide
oak balustraded stairs there was a
heaviness in the atmosphere a gloom
that permeated everything the butler
shivered jones eyes grew hard
there was no evidence of anything out
of the ordinary but both knew that
something was wrong
  the door to strickland guerneys
study fronted the wide stairway it
was a huge affair of age-blackened oak
that had been imported from a chateau
in normandy jones rapped several
times and called his uncles name
there was no answer
  i told you sir quavered bradley
  the younger man stooped and ap-
plied his eye to the key-hole
  a limited segment of the room
sprang into view the rows of book-
cases against the walls the untidy table
and the great carved chair that strick-
land guerney used but it was none
of these things that caused j sylvester
jones to straighten up with a little
sucking in of his breath


black shadows
  wait here bradley he instructed
ill be back in a moment
  he clattered downstairs and flung
open the door to the street
  hawker
  the chauffeur-an old-young man
with a sharp profile and blood-shot eyes
-sprang to attention
  yes sir
  drive like the devil to the police-
station and bring some officers here at
once better have one who knows
something about locks we cant batter
this door down
  when the limousine had roared up
the street jones slowly re-climbed the
stairs bradley was fussing nervously
about the hall straightening chairs and
pictures that were already in mathe-
matically accurate positions
  its dreadful sir sighed the old
butler i peeped through the keyhole
sir i could just see the top of his
head slewed around at a most peculiar
angle-and it never moves sir
  do you-do you think he might
have done himself an injury jones
asked
  if injurys been done he has done
it himself you know the study sir
there are no windows in the regular
sense only those iron barred transoms
near the ceiling and no living thing
could get through them and this door
sir-there was only one key and that
mr guerney carried on his watch-
chain-
  the tramp of heavy feet sounded in
the hallway below jones called anx-
iously and a portentous file ascended
the steps first came lieutenant jamie-
son then district detective otoole
patrolman bierhalter and finally a
jviry grey-eyed irresistible known to
all the city as johnny suggs son of
the owner of the evening star
hawker edged furtively on the edge of
the procession
  well asked the lieutenant heavily
 whats the trouble here  he seemed
 somewhat awed by jones wonderful
 sartorial display and suggs added to it
 by informing him in a whisper that j
 sylvester was the nephew of old mil-
 lionaire guerney
   jones said im afraid something
 has happened to my uncle i thought
 it best to call the police immediately
 you did right mister jones com-
 mented the lieutenant he  laid his
 hand on the knob of the study door
 and rattled it-with no results natu-
 rally you couldnt break down this
 door without a tank hey bierhalter
 get busy on the lock
   wait a minute cut in the reporter
 whipping out a magnifying glass
 what do you say if we look this over
 first loot nobodys monkeyed with
 the lock it has been opened and shut
 with a key all right
   jamieson who prided himself on
 looking after the fine points of every
 case flushed because he had not thought
 of that himself with extraordinary
 gruffness he ordered bierhalter to get
 busy it required ten minutes of con-
 centrated effort on the policemans part
 before he flung open the door
   there was the stuffiness of decay in
 the chamber-the nameless creeping
 horror that is always present when
 death comes by violence solemnly the
 little party crossed the room and looked
 at the figure in the carved chair
   it was that of a man of sixty big
 paunched and heavy lipped strickland
 guemey had been known as a con-
 noiseur in all that pertained to the appe-
 tites and his face was that of a gour-
 -inand there was a half snarl on his
 face and a revolver lay on the floor
 below the drooping fingers of the right
 hand his left fist rested on the table
 edge and gripped the study-key the
 fine silk of his shirt front was caked
 with dried blood
   jamieson his pique forgotten mo-
black shadows

 mentarily was once more the calloused
 police official he touched guerneys
 pasty cheek lifted the right arm
 dropped it heavily and crinkled the
 blood clotted shirt between his fingers
  i aint no doctor but i can see this
mans been dead at least three hours
say what do you know about this
he turned suddenly on the trembling
bradley
  n-nothing sir except what i told
mr sylvester sir
  what was that
  this morning master gave the serv-
ants a holiday but i stayed in my room
because i wasnt feeling well at noon
i knocked on his door to find out if
he required lunch and he told me to
go to the devil quite harshly sir that
was the last time i heard him speak
twice afterward i knocked but re-
ceived no answer then mr sylvester
came and he sent for you there is
only one key to the study sir and-
and mr guerney has that in his hand
how is it you didnt hear the shot
my room is downstairs and there
were several closed doors between
the lieutenant grunted and then
looked at jones can you add any-
thing to that
  nothing of value im afraid my
uncle and i were on the best of terms
i usually called on him twice a week-
monday and friday-
  this is thursday jamieson shot
out
  i know it retorted jones with
some asperity i had intended leaving
for new haven tomorrow and i
wanted to see uncle strickland before
i left what are you trying to do-
shoulder the crime on to me
  the lieutenant hastily denied that
any such idea had been in his mind
  but we gotta clear up every point
you see now where did you spend
your time this afternoon
  i left the hotel st regis where i
have my apartments at one oclock
and drove through the park until two-
fifteen-yes im sure it was two-fif-
teen for i had an appointment with
miss daisy graelis of the bohemian
follies at two-thirty we went to the
ambassadeurs and danced until four
when i escorted miss graelis home
it was after five when i left her and
i came directly here that accounts
for every minute of my time
   i guess its all right said jamieson
he drew his detective aside and ques-
tioned him in a whisper
  there aint nothin to it at all
snorted otoole its a dead open-
an-shut case o suicide theres a
thirty-eight calibre gun with one car-
tridge fired the door was locked an
no way o getting into the place
without a keg of dynamite why
loot this is the easiest thing i ever
see
  jamieson sighed with relief youre
right marty ring up the coroners
office and have them send a man up
ill leave bierhalter here to look after
things whats the matter mr jones
youre white as a sheet
  the dandy nodded im frightfully
upset-shock you know he admitted
if you dont mind ill wait downstairs
for any questions you may want to ask
me
  pretty tough on him said jamie-
son when j sylvester jones had gone
  johnny suggs who had been exam-
ining the room and particularly the
table and floor with keenest interest
said
  oh do you think so he is guer-
neys only relative and i understand
that he will inherit everything the old
man left
  the lieutenant looked up quickly
he had a profound respect for john-
nys shr wdness and there was some-
thing in the reporters tone that shot a
shaft of suspicion into his brain

black shadows
    you dont think jones did this
  he demanded
    do you
     no i dont its suicide all right
   what else could it be here he is
   locked in his own room with a gun-
   its his gun all right for you can see
   his name on that plate on the butt
     i saw it said suggs dryly
     then what the devil do you mean
  johnny picked up a sheet of paper
  from the table it bore the legend
  strickland guerney- mammoth
  building and a few lines of scratchy
  writing addressed to the curio com-
  pany of america requesting the price
  of a collection of weapons used by the
   dayak head hunters it was dated at
  noon that day
     doesnt it suggest anything to your
  mind the reporter asked
     jamieson scratched his head read it
  over again and looked puzzled i -
  cant say it does he admitted you
  dont thifik any of these dayak birds
  did this-
     certainly not the slight shrug of
  johnnys shoulders indicated vast dis-
  gust with the official police why
  lieutenant this letter was written by a
  left-handed man he turned to brad-
  ley mr guerney was left-handed
  was he not
     the butler nodded
     then said suggs triumphantly if
  mr guerney committed suicide how
  did he manage to shoot himself drop
  the revolver on his right side and pick
  up the key with his left suicide
  this is murder lieutenant you can bet
  a years pay on that
chapter ii
     in the private office of the stars
  owner johnny suggs told his story
    ive checked up on jones story
  he concluded and everything is just
  as he said the manager at the st
regis miss daisy graelis and the head
waiter at the ambassadeurs as well as
his own chauffeur can account for
every moment of his time that after-
noon it is possible that bradley the
old butler committed the crime but i
dont believe it hes the mildest crea-
ture that ever walked lieutenant
jamieson arrested him of course but
if youll give me the chance dad ill
prove that he had nothing to do
with it
  the elder suggs elevated his heels
to the desk-top and looked out at the
murky wrack of sky
   its good stuff he said approving-
ly and will make a corking story but
what about the finish johnny we
want to find out who committed the
murder-and youre no detective
  johnny flushed crime detection
isnt a secret art he protested any-
body with the wit and patience can do
it give me a chance at it these
boneheads like jamieson and otoole
will never catch the murderer i saw
what they missed once i may be able
to do it again
  youre a regular william j burns-
holmes arent you if you can find
out who killed guerney in a locked
room with no known mode of egress
they ought to make you police com-
missioner but we wont build any
triumphal arches until you do the job
go to it
  johnny sprang to his feet and
cracked his heels together
   ill do it all right
  highly elated he descended to the
street it was eleven oclock and he
was tired from his chase about town
verifying jones story but he had no
desire to go to bed then as a matter
of fact he intended going back to the
guerney residence and conducting a
minute investigation of the dead mans
study he had not seen all he wanted
to see that afternoon and as the house
black shadows

had been locked he would have all the
opportunity he desired if he could ef-
fect an entrance
  a taxi was standing by the curb
johnny climbed in and gave the chauf-
feur his instructions in a moment
more he was whirling along the bril-
liantly lighted street on the first lap
of his search for strickland guerneys
murderer
  three blocks from his destination
suggs left the taxi a policeman was
lolling in front of the house of death
so johnny gave it a wide berth and
entered the alley behind it required
only a moment to scale the fence and
feel his way through the darkness to
the kitchen window
   anticipating his course of action the
reporter carried with him a chisel a
jimmy and an electric torch in the
utter blackness of the yard he did not
dare use his torch for fear a roaming
policeman might see it so depending
on his sense of touch he felt for the
window chisel in one hand
  when he found it  sudden cold
streak went up his spine it was open
three inches from the bottom
  there was someone in that house
suggs did not doubt it for a moment
he was positive it was not the police
for they had secured the key to the
front door it was either the murderer
come back to the scene of his crime or
some house-breaker who had followed
close on the news of guerneys death
and hoped to reap a harvest johnny
was not armed but he shoved the win-
dow higher swung his leg across the
sill and climbed in
  the house was horribly still suggs
framed the kitchen wall with a circle
of light and stepping very cautiously
reached the door and peered into the
dining-room no one there no
one in the butlers pantry no one on
the first floor at all
  was there anyone in the room where
strickland guerney had met his death
  very softly johnny began the ascent
of the wide staircase then as he
strained his ears he heard the rustle
of a skirt and the soft smothered
whimper of a frightened woman he
shrank back against the wall and
waited
  a bar of light crept out of the dark-
ness and rested on the age-blackened
oak of the study door it wavered as
though the one who held it was nerv-
ous and then into that bar of light
was stretched a womans hand-a slim
marvelously white hand that fitted a
key into the lock
  bit by bit the reporter edged up the
stairs he had noticed where the elec-
tric light switch was located on his first
visit there that afternoon and it stood
him in good stead now his hand felt
along the wall until it touched the but-
ton and then he flooded the hall with
dazzling light
  with a gasp of fright the woman
straightened up and turned her soft
fair hair fell about her pallid cheeks
and the graceful gown she wore was
spotted and torn from her trip over the
fence and the kitchen window-sill
even in that startling moment johnny
commented to himself on her wonder-
ful beauty
  who are you she whispered
  the reporter smiled i was just
going to ask that question of you
who are you  she repeated tensely
what are you doing here
  my name is john suggs and i hap-
pen temporarily to be a wage slave of
the evening star you see he said
with a careless wave of his free hand
i was at the district police station
when the news of mr guerneys mur-
der arrived-
  murder whispered the girl her
hand going to her breast murder
i-i thought the papers said it was sui-
cide-

black shadows
  so the police thought at first
johnny sighed they are shockingly
unobservant but i found that he had
been murdered did you do it
  he took a sudden step forward and
pointed his finger at her accusingly if
he had expected her to show fright or
fear he was disappointed the girl
straightened up and a hot color flamed
in her cheeks
  i she cried you are insane
i am mildred guerney-strickland
guerneys daughter
  johnny laughed my dear young
lady please-if you had merely stated
that you knew nothing of this affair i
should have been inclined to believe
you but it seems to be a pretty well
known fact that mr guerney was a
bachelor and has no relatives except a
nephew-j sylvester jones
  its a lie-a lie my mother was
the daughter of a british resident
among the dayaks in borneo mr
guerney came there on a hunting ex-
pedition and married her they lived
together for ten years-then he de-
serted her mother never gave up the
search for him she died in singapore
a year ago-and she urged me to keep
seeking him i traced him to this city
two days ago i met old bradley jvho
had cared for me when i was a child
in borneo he promised to help-
and so bradley took an impression
of the lock and had that key made for
you said johnny with a rare flash of
inspiration
  oh she shrank against the doors
age-blackened panels
  didnt he
  a tear stole from under her lowered
lashes y-yes
  the reporter took her hand gently
my dear miss guerney he said
please dont think im utterly heart-
less it is my business to find out who
committed this crime i dont think
you did-i know- you didnt no one
in their right senses could look at you
for a moment and believe you guilty of
a cold blooded murder-even of such
an old reprobate as guerney seemed to
be
  i-i really didnt she said bro-
kenly
  but dont you see that circumstan-
tially the case looks rather black
against you personally i dont be-
lieve in circumstantial evidence i
wouldnt convict a cat on it even if
pussy still had the cream on her whis-
kers courts of law and juries look on
those things differently as the matter
stands you had a motive in seeking re-
venge-you are the only other person
besides mr guerney-to our knowledge
at least-who had a key to this door
please dont cry cant you see that
im trying to help you-to find a meth-
od of defense have you any idea
who might-have killed your-your fa-
ther
  she hesitated
  tell me suggs urged even if you
have only the barest suspicion we
must get to the bottom of this matter
  j-jones she said
  jones i checked him over every
minute of time from noon until six
oclock which covers the period in
which mr guerney was last known to
be alive and the moment the police
arrived here what makes you think
he is guilty
  by this time mildred guerney had
entirely regained control of herself
johnny admired her for that the
position in which she found herself
would have developed more than incipi-
ent hysteria in most girls he could
see that the marvelously white hand
that held the key was steady once more
her voice when she answered was
clear and low
  i am making no accusations mr
suggs i do not know mr jones per-
sonally but i did learn how he ingra-
black shadows

tiatcd himself with my father so much
so that he was named in the will as the
sole heir from all accounts he is a
typical man about town-a selfish
pleasure-seeking idler he lives at the
st regis owns a limousine has a
chauffeur-yet he is desperately in debt
and his bank balance is less than a hun-
dred dollars certainly that would
seem to indicate that he would have an
interest in my fathers death
  from whom did you learn all this
from bradley she said defiantly
i ee mused johnny yes that
would be a motive if he did do it-
now miss guerney there is just one
other thing that i want to ask you if i
may
  what is that 
  why are you here tonight
  i am looking for the will jones
has no right to that money he will only
squander it in the cabarets anyway
my mothers people are desperately
poor they have been good to me and
 intend seeing that they are made com-
fortable with my fathers money i
dont care anything about it for myself
i am young and can work- she
threw out her beautiful arms in a ges-
ture of defiance
  johnny took the key from her
well we might as well go in the study
you may find what you want-and so
may i
  he fitted the key in the lock-and
found the door unlocked it was pitch
dark in there-a velvety sort of black-
ness that one could almost feel suggs
turned his flash on the walls and lo-
cated the electric switch this time
when he turned it on there was no
gush of light but the lamp on the study
table winked into being
  then mildred guerney screamed a
blood chilling sound in that great dark
house johnny sprang to her side his
eyes following the pointing line of her
finger
  a man lay face down on the carpet
his clothes were of the latest cut
though crumpled and torn in places a
dark wet spot shone on the carpet by
his chest
  suggs knelt turned him over and
looked into the dead staring eyes of j
sylvester jones
chapter iii
  when john suggs reached home
that night-or morning rather as it
was verging on four oclock-lie sat
down at his desk with paper and pen
and summed up the evidence against
the three suspects
  first j sylvester jones he had
a motive as he was reported to be the
sole heir of strickland guerneys
wealth on die other hand he lived at
the most expensive hotel in the city
and seemed to have considerable mon-
ey despite his lack of a balance at the
bank there was no real evidence
against him
  second bradley the butler there
was no definite motive though he might
have committed the crime for mildred
guerneys sake the strongest link
connecting him with the murder was
the fact that he was the only known
person in the house at the time of guer-
neys death the fact that he openly
admitted this when he might have eas-
ily gone out and established an alibi
was a point in his favor
  third mildred guerney her mo-
tive could have been revenge though
she was not of a type likely to harbor
that sentiment according to her story
however she had ample cause to hate
the old millionaire the fact that she
possessed a key to the study door was
certainly a damning bit of evidence
against her-

black shadows
  when he reached that point suggs
tore up the paper in disgust he had
searched every inch of the study with-
out finding a single clue that would aid
him if jones had killed guerney who
in turn had killed jones if he had
not who had
  after finding the body of jones in
the guerney study and failing to locate
a scrap of evidence that would incrimi-
nate the killer of guerney or of jones
johnny had taken mildred away from
the house of death she had not found
her fathers will so both were in a de-
spondent frame of mind the girl was
staying at a modest little hotel uptown
and she promised to telephone the re-
porter if anything of importance oc-
curred
  lying back in his chair eyes closed
suggs tried to logically put to-
gether the small bits of knowledge
he possessed into a comprehensive
whole
  the theory advanced by the tran-
scendent detectives of fiction-that no
human being could enter a room with-
out leaving some clue to his identity-
johnny found to be fallacious there
was not the vestige of a clue in guer-
neys study and why should there
be  the murderer had probably slipped
into the house-if he was not one of
the household-quietly walked upstairs
opened the study door and killed guer-
ney as the latter sat in his chair it
could only be by the most colossal luck
that the killer would drop some identi-
fying bit of personal property and he
had not done so there had been no
rain or snow to make convenient foot-
prints
  deduction as practiced by holmes
and dupin was all very well but even
those masters had to have some con-
crete clue from which to argue there
was not a single one for either the
jones or the gurney murder yet they
were evidently joined by a connecting
link it was inconceivable that it
should be otherwise
  the figures of jones bradley and
mildred guerney filled suggs mental
vision his perspective of the case was
clogged by their bulk one of them
had very likely committed the crime
then jones was killed bradley was
in prison and so eliminated fromthat
angle of the case but mildred had
been in the house-had been there be-
fore suggs made his unexpected ap-
pearance and she possessed the key
to the study door
  was mildred guerney the double
murderess 
  every fibre of johnny suggs being
revolted at the thought he thought
of her pallid face clear cut as a cameo
and framed by the crown of soft fair
hair it was the face of a pure warm
hearted girl-and one utterly incapable
of such a crime it was on her slender
shoulders though that the black shad-
ow of suspicion lay most heavily
  at dawn johnny gave up the prob-
lem temporarily washed and shaved
and slipped out of the house without
awakening anyone he took a car
downtown and had breakfast at an all-
night restaurant of the lunch-stand
variety it was dim and gray in the
city-a gloomy foreboding morning
with a shroud of fog creeping in from
the river
  the reporter lit a cigar and having
nothing particular to do strolled over
to the star office the city room was
empty save for a sleepy figure curled
up in one of the cjiairs suggs foot-
falls aroused it
  hlo johnny he husked reaching
mechanically for a cigarette what n
the deuce are you doing down here at
this time o night f i was the son
of the boss of this paper i wouldnt
work at all- he lapsed back into
somnolent desuetude
  oh you wouldnt repeated john-
black shadows

ny with keen sarcasm i like palm
beach and yachts and joy parties as
much as you do but you see me work-
ing dont you- youd do it too if he
was your governor
  by the way the other man woke
up suddenly a note came in for you
about eleven oclock laying on your
desk over there its from bradley the
butler whos been held in this guerney
murder mystery friend of yours
suggs picked up the crumpled envel-
ope with his name scrawled on it
who brought it 
  a hard looking bird-one of the
guards i guess
  johnny ripped open the envelope and
read
dear mr suggs 
   probably the peculiarity of this will strike
you at once i feel that you are a friend
if you would do me a favor when you hear
of my death-and i feel that the end is not
far-will you have my body disposed of as
was that of gustave edmonson who wrote
the psychology of the working classes
with many thinks for your keenness
respectfully yours
james r bradley
  the reporter stared at the note
  it might as well have been a jumble
of unintelligible gibberish so far as he
was concerned
  then two lines in the letter seemed
to spring out in bold faced letters
the peculiarity of this will strike
you at once and many thanks for
your keenness
  the mild eyed old butler was trying
to send him a cipher message
  now johnny had gained valuable
experience with codes during his serv-
ice in the intelligence section of a fa-
mous combat division in france he
had learned to read ciphers of many
kinds so tired and aching as he was
he sat down at his desk and tried to
unravel this one
  after an hour of concentrated effort
suggs decided that if it was a code it
was too cleverly done for him to solve
the letter was so short that it gave him
no opportunity this reference to
gustave edmonson and his book threw
no light on the subject the psychol-
ogy of the working classes was in
the stars library johnny brought it
out read over the contents page and
skipped through the volume but it car-
ried no suggestion to his mind it was
dull and prosy in the extreme and the
possibility that it might have any con-
nection with the double murder in the
guerney house seemed rather far
fetched
  at eight oclock he called up lieu-
tenant jamieson anything new de-
velop loot-in the guerney case i
mean 
  new howled jamieson ill say
there has now listen johnny im
giving you this first of all because
youve helped me in the past and any-
way i want due credit with your dad
for giving his paper first crack at it
soon as i get done talking come down
to the guerney house ill be there by
the time you arrive
  all right shoot
  theres been big doings down there
last night patrolman duffy was on
special duty in front of the place hes
a good sober man and he swore that
he wasnt a hundred yards from the
house all night every hour or two he
walked around through the alley and
looked things over from the back he
didnt see a light or hear a sound up
till three-thirty at that time duffy
was standing by the guerney stejjs and
he heard a shot from inside
  well he rapped for assistance
broke a window and climbed in he
saw a light upstairs and tore up there
hell bent for election the door to the
study was open-
  open interrupted johnny i
thought i locked it
  what 

black shadows
  i said i thought you looked it
  i did but open it was and the fur-
niture was smashed up generally as
though there had been a scrap-
what suggs was thoroughly sur-
prised now when he was in the study
only a few hours before this occurrence
everything had been in apple-pie order
and now-
  i said everything was broken up
the policeman said peevishly this
damned phones out of order and you
cant hear anything right chairs
broken up pictures busted loose from
the walls-the room smashed general-
ly
  come on get to the finish urged
suggs youre not telling a short
story with a carefully arranged climax
i want to get all the dope for the sheet
jamiesons hoarse laugh rumbled
over the wire we found a dead man
in the study youre a clever lad and
quite an amateur detective yourself
but ill bet you cant guess who it
was
  ive got a ten-spot that says i can
said johnny touched in his pride at
the policemans dig at his sleuthing pro-
pensities
  youre on who was it
  suggs braced himself for the bellow
that would come through the receiver
j sylvester jones he said
  oh no laughed jamieson you
thought i was a dummy when i sug-
gested that it might be one of those
dayak fellows who croaked strickland
guerney well there isnt an acre of
green in my eye son patrolman duffy
found one of those dayaks in guer-
neys room with a bullet hole drilled
through his heart
chapter iv
  utterly amazed at this turn of
events johnny sketched what had been
told him to his sleepy compatriot and
that gentleman galvanized into instant
life began hammering out the story on
his typewriter
  better let the old man look it over
suggs suggested hes interested in
this guerney affair and wants to keep
his finger on it better call him on the
phone tell him whats happened and
that ive gone up to the house to look
things over
  johnny was lucky enough to get a
trolley without much delay and every
rumbling foot of the way he kept ask-
ing himself what had become of jones
body what malign influence was be-
hind these repeated killings he
thought of his fathers words dont
build yourself any triumphal arches
until the job is done the governor
was right as usual anyone who
solved this mystery deserved a trium-
phal arch at that
  twenty minutes later he reached the
guerney residence and was admitted
by lieutenant jamieson himself
  come upstairs and take a look at
the study the latter invited ill ad-
mit this has me buffaloed just where
this brown skinned baby horns into the
picture is beyond me now if it had
been jones-as you guessed-we might
have been able to fix up a story that
would jibe with the facts you know
but this- he shrugged his shoulders
bradley must have been mistaken
about only the one key the study
door was open and i know that i
locked it before we left
  johnny nodded he had locked the
door himself with mildreds key at one
oclock that morning the appearance
of another one relieved him for it
shifted the shadow from the girl be-
tween one oclock and three-thirty the
possessor of the third key-who was
probably the murderer they sought-
had entered the house who was he
  the reporter and the police lieuten-
ant walked upstairs
johnny knelt beside hint his keen eyes roving over the wonderfully developed
body-pagfe 


black shadows
  a man lay on the study floor almost
directly on the spot where j sylvester
jones had sprawled when suggs dis-
covered him earlier in the morning
he was a dayak finely developed phys-
ically and from the tattoo marks on
arms and shoulders evidently of a chief
family he wore five silver leg rings
and a bead necklace for ornaments and
a cheap overcoat in deference to
western customs his head had been
crowned by a peculiar bit of dayak
millinery decorated with a hornbill
feather but it had rolled off into a
corner a parang or short sword with
a beautifully carved handle was
gripped in his fist as though he had
been awaiting an assault
  johnny knelt beside him his keen
eyes roving over the wonderfully de-
veloped body and the section of floor
immediately beside it quite possibly
this was the man who had killed both
strickland guerney and j sylvester
jones if he was who in turn had
killed him certainly not bradley
who was in jail very improbably
mildred whom he had escorted to her
hotel an hours ride from this place
then it was someone who had not as
yet been suspected
  well what do you make of it
asked jamieson
  suggs rose walked across the room
apparently following a trail that was
invisible to the lieutenants eyes he
slopped before the fireplace in which
no fire had been built for months ex-
amined it carefully glanced up the
chimney and walked back to the
dayaks body
  ive found a few things he said
that you probably overlooked in the
first place there hasnt been any strug-
gle here all this smashing up has
been done for effect if there really
had been a struggle between this dayak
and a man powerful enough to give him
a battle do you think that he would
still have held the parang in his hand
in that way  the way i read it is this
the dayak came into the room all
ready for action and was shot down
before he was able to make a move
it isnt possible that if there had been
a fight that knocked over all this furni-
ture that this light table with the lamp
would have survived no the place
was carefully wrecked before the
dayak was killed
  jamieson grunted why beforef
the reporters voice grew sarcastic
do you imagine anyone could have
wrecked this place and made a get-
away between the time the shot was
fired and duffy arrived
  why the devil should he wreck it at
all 
  ah thats the question the only
reason i can see is that the murderer
was searching for something he tore
things up regardless in looking for it
well he was disappointed then
grunted the lieutenant we took
everything of value-papers and money
-over to the station when we left
johnny could have kicked himself
im certainly the prize cheese detec-
tive of the world he told himself
so mildred and i- he already called
her that in his thoughts-wasted all
that time looking for something that
was in jamiesons safe i should have
known that much
  anything else demanded jamie-
son
oh yes quite the most important
of all and its going to prevent you
from collecting that ten-spot from me
what do you mean you bet that
we would find jones body here
  and so you will he rolled the
dayaks body to one side look at
that blood spot too far down to have
come from this savages wound
someone else was killed in this room
before mr dayak there are two
drops of blood between here and the
black shadows

fireplace i looked up the chimney
and caught a glimpse of something
ill wager that youll find jones body
jammed up in there
  jamieson detective otoole and the
two patrolmen made a rush for the
fireplace in ten seconds they had
demonstrated the truth of suggs state-
ment and the soot-smeared twisted
body of the late dandy was stretched
beside that of the dayak
  they looked at him with far more
respect than they had ever exhibited
before
  ill take my hat off to you johnny
the lieutenant admitted now tell me
who did it i cant afford to lose out
on this case after letting mullaney
make a clean get-away last month
the reporter laughed i dont
know
  youre holding out on me com-
plained jamieson
  no im not i really dont know
enough to help you but i hope to add a
little to that knowledge by this after-
noon when i do  let you know
you can gamble on that im not try-
ing to build up a reputation with the
force all i want to do is get solid
with my dad he never had a very
high opinion of my abilities and i want
to prove to him that he is wrong
  ill have to be covered up a bit until
something breaks what is your paper
going to say 
  oh well fix that up all right the
reporter assured him the star
will have a story full of glittering gen-
eralities giving all due credit to the
foxy police who found out that this ap-
parent scrap was a frame-up
  all right agreed jamieson slight-
ly mollified but for heavens sake let
me know as soon as anything breaks
sure thing
  johnnyused the telephone in the hall
to call up the paper his father was
in the office having come down imme-
diately at the news of the developments
in the guerney case the older man
listened quietly then asked
  have you any clues at all 
  well said johnny guardedly
maybe yes and maybe no im going
after something right away
  keeler tells me that you received a
cipher note from bradley have you
figured out what it means
  no i believe it is too short for a
message and i am hopeful that another
part will come soon until it does i
am going to follow out some ideas of
my own by the way dad lieutenant
jamieson wants you to cover him up
until something breaks
  of course
  johnny rang off it was his intention
to go to mildred and find out from her
if she had been accompanied by the
dayak as a servant and if he had taken
up her quarrel and been killed in fol-
lowing it out that seemed very likely
he might have murdered guerney and
jones but suggs could not understand
who in turn had killed him
  it was rather too early to call on miss
guerney considering the late hour at
which she had retired it was quite pos-
sible that she had not yet arisen so
johnny left the house bent on walking
to the little uptown hotel
  the sun had chased the fog back to
the river reaches and it was delicious
in the open after breathing the death-
ridden atmosphere of the guerney
house suggs threw back his shoul-
ders and strode along at a good pace
keenly enjoying the exercise
  he received something of a shock
when he inquired at mildreds hotel
only to find that she had left an hour
before
  you mister suggs asked the clerk
after volunteering the information
  yes
  well she left a message for you
probly thought youd be here pretty

black shadows
soon tell im she said to come to
 phillips street right away i
guess its most goshalmighty important
oh thanks
  johnny sprinted out into the street
hailed a taxi and ordered the mahout
to drive at top speed to the phillips
street address there was no use try-
ing to figure out in advance what this
sudden change of base meant-except
trouble for mildred
  they arrived at their destination in
extraordinarily quick time suggs paid
off the chauffeur and reached the front
door in approximately three seconds
it was open and he went in
  from the upper floor he heard mil-
dreds voice sound in fright and pro-
test johnny went flying up with the
speed of a ten-second man when he
reached the landing he saw her strug-
gling in the arms of a tall black-beard-
ed man at the sight a flood of anger
and passion welled up in the reporter
he had only seen her once but that was
enough her beauty and courage had
captivated his heart in spite of the black
shadow that hung over her
  the girl saw him called his name as
her assailant tossed her back and faced
the door
  johnny flung himself forward with
the silent ferocity of a beast though
far smaller than the other man the
desperation of his attack more than
made up the difference his fists lashed
against black-beard who was broad
and thick and solid on the ground
they drove the latters head against
the wall panelling with a force that
would have stunned a weaker man
  instead it seemed to spur black-
beard into action he clenched johnny
around the middle and buried his bushy
face against that young gentlemans
chest but the reporter blocked him
off with sharp elbows and drumming
fists he realized that he would have
small chance at close quarters his
only salvation lay in keeping clear of
those ape-like arms
 the big man drew back panting
heavily then lowered his head into the
shelter of his left shoulder and rushed
again johnny leaped nimbly aside but
slipped out a lagging foot and black-
beard went over it with a crash that
stunned him the reporter was atop
him instantly his thumbs sinking into
the great muscles at the side of the
neck the paralyzing pressure stopped
the fellows breath-made him choke
and beat the air feebly
 mildred ran to his side come
come she whispered oh quickly
we must get away from here-
  he looked up at her the old irrepres-
sible light dancing in his eyes the
touch of her hand on his shoulder
thrilled him
  i think well turn this fellow over to
the police first he said gaily these
few punches have not been punishment
enough for him
  no no it is impossible come
so johnny rose and with a contemptu-
ous glance at black-beard walked
downstairs with mildred
  once again out in the clear sunshine
the wonder of this affair grew on him
he felt just the reverse of wilkie col-
lins famous detective - that gentleman
was so used to doing big things that the
little ones escaped him-like a senior
wrangler who has forgotten how to do
quadratics and has to solve problems
of the second degree by the calculus
johnny felt like a youngster who has
never learned mathematics and has been
ordered to do a most intricate problem
the twists and turns of this guerney
case he knew would make him gray-
haired before his time
  will you please tell me the mean-
ing of this miss guerney he im-
plored every step becomesmore dif-
ficult we found j sylvester jones
dead in your fathers study at one
the girl saw him called his name as her assailant tossed her back and faced the
door-page 
b m- sept-	j

black shadows
oclock this morning at three-thirty
the officer on the beat heard a shot
entered the house and found the room
wrecked and a big dayak lying dead
on the floor jones body had been
crammed up the chimney do you
know this dayak  what were you do-
ing in this vacant house who was
that bearded man  i think at times that
i see a light and then matters become
more foggy than ever 
  the girl considered the dayak
was probably tama aping who swore
to revenge himself some day on my
father he was different from mot of
his people-sullen vicious to the core
yes he is the only one i can recall who
would spend these years in a search for
an enemy
  it really doesnt help us much
granting that he killed mr guerney
the problem of his own death and
jones is just as puzzling but what
were you doing in this house mil-
miss guerney
  the house belonged to my mother
mr suggs the black-bearded man
had been watching me i wanted to get
away from him and i came here think-
ing i had shaken him off instead he
was close on my heels forced his way
in and seized me
  why
  he-he said he was a detective and
wanted to arrest me for the murder of
strickland guerney
chapter v
  johnnys heart jumped with a sud-
den throb of fear how had the police
secured intelligence of strickland guer-
neys daughter if they had and knew
what cause she had for hating him her
arrest was only a matter of a few hours
now this detective-the reporter
closed his eyes for an instant trying to
place those features in the gallery of
his mind detective why the man
was black allen a gunman of more
than local renown undoubtedly some
one was interested in having mildred
guerney put out of the way and that
person suggs believed was the mur-
derer he sought
  with a word to mildred the re-
porter ran back to the house if the
thumb-screws were put on black allen
he might tell who had hired him which
would save a lot of time and trouble
johnny had left him in the house be-
cause he believed as the girl had that
the fellow was a detective now he
was anxious to find him but allen
having enough of suggs punching abil-
ity had disappeared
  the reporter explained the situation
to the girl and together they returned
to mildreds hotel johnny waited in the
lobby while she packed her things then
he chartered a taxi and had them taken
to another hostelry in an entirely dif-
ferent section of the city this would
throw the allen contingent off the track
for awhile at least
  once more back on the job johnnys
mind harked to the supposed cipher
message bradley had sent him what
necessity was there for it the butler
could just as easily have sent for him
and told whatever he wanted there
was no need for mystic flub-dubbery
  the reporters anxiety to unravel the
tangle and find out who had killed
guerney jones and the dayak chief in-
creased with every passing moment
though he had no very high respect for
the -gentlemen in the municipal detec-
tive office he admitted that they some-
times stumbled on the truth through
sheer persistence and he was very
much afraid that in their blind fumbling
around they would lay hands on mil-
dred guerney though johnny was
sure that she had not committed the
crime he knew that the police would be
harder to convince besides if he could
lay hands on the murderer of strickland
i
black shadows

guerney these attacks oh mildred would
cease
  the reporter stopped at fifteenth
street to wait for a car that would
carry him downtown to the prison
where bradley was held in durance
while he waited a glittering rolls-
royce limousine purred up to the curb
hawker chauffeur for the late j syl-
vester jones turned his little bloodshot
eyes on suggs
  mr suggs sir is it not  he asked
with the soft deference of those who
fetch and carry for the rich im in
a bit of a corner sir and seeing you
yesterday at mr guerneys house and
hearing so highly of your capabilities-
begging your pardon sir-ive come to
you for a bit of advice
  fire when ready said johnny good
humoredly
  isnt there any place i can take you
sir 
  well im going down to the
prison-
  prison 
  to see bradley mr guerneys
butler
  hawker wagged his head hypocriti-
cally to think that whited sepulchre
should kill his master it is almost un-
believable
  do you believe it 
  of course he was the only one in
the house at the time but you are go-
ing to the prison sir if you will ride
on the seat with me i can explain my-
self on the way down sir
  so the reporter sprang nimbly in be-
side the over-groomed hawker and the
big machine leaped away with the satis-
fied purr of a giant cat
  it is a most peculiar situation sir
began the chauffeur you see i was
in the service of the jones family for
years when mr sylvester went for
himself i followed as valet and chauf-
feur-the establishment being a small
one do you see sir  he thought very
much of me if i do say it and his fam-
ily having passed away he made a will
leaving everything to me
  johnny turned a pair of brightly sus-
picious eyes on hawker who returned
the gaze steadily for an instant before
swinging it again to the street
  it develops sir the chauffeur con-
tinued that mr sylvester left prac-
tically nothing his bank balance is
almost non-existent this car and his
other personal belongings must go to
satisfy his creditors it is very sad-
how close he was sailing to the wind
sir
  that makes it rather hard for you
observed suggs but why are you
telling me
  im distrustful of lawyers and i had
to talk about it with someone here
is the strange part sir the chauf-
feur whirled the car around a corner
and threaded his way through a maze
of traffic at a speed that was a testimo-
nial to his cleverness i understand
that my master inherited all of mr
guerneys vast fortune many a time
mr sylvester told me of his expecta-
tions so naturally i expect to receive
the money that would have gone to
him-
  they had reached the gray forbid-
ding walls of the prison and the rolls-
royce came to a stop before the gates
johnny descended but hesitated a mo-
ment one foot lagging on the running-
board he had an idea and he wanted
to see more of hawker
  i think i can do something for you
he said as soon as i am free im
coming to see you
  you can find me at the st regis
garage sir
  johnnys eyes met the little blood-
shot ones in a meaning glance
  and you he added can do some-
thing for me
  with a careless nod he strolled to-
ward the wardens office

black shadows
  it was quite natural that suggs should
know the warden of the prison it was
equally natural that the warden should
be glad to do  favor for a newspaper-
man and the son of one of the citys
most influential men when johnny
asked to talk with bradley the warden
-supposing it to be an ordinary inter-
view that was desired-assented and
led him to the old butlers cell himself
  the wistful little man was reading
his bible but he laid it down and rose
as johnny entered there was some-
thing pathetically small and dusty about
him-so much like a once-loved toy that
has been relegated to a far corner of
the closet-that suggs felt very sorry
for him he said a word or two about
being sad to see him there bradley
responded gratefully
  the warden considerately withdrew
out of earshot
  suggs said i received that message
you sent me but couldnt make head or
tail of it so i came here to get the thing
straight from your own lips
  bradley looked at him in a confused
sort of a way i-i dont know what
youre talking about sir
  theres no need for mystification or
melodrama said johnny impatiently
i want to help clear this matter up
you shouldnt be here but there are
others who should most of all i want
to help mildred guerney
  he thrust his face close to bradleys
and uttered that phrase with the utmost
emphasis of which he was capable
  the butlers chin dropped his mild
blue eyes distended
  dont you see man the reporter
whispered tensely i want to help
her it is quite possible that the police
will hear of her shortly tell me what-
ever you know it may help
  bradley sat down on the cot and
wrung his hands i dont know a
thin mr suggs i swear to god i
dont except that i made the impres-
sion of the lock on his study door for
her i did sleep most of the afternoon
and i dont know what happened during
that time-
  did mrv guerney really give the
servants the day off or did you
  he did
 why
  i had told him mildred was coming
to the house he was afraid she would
make a scene and the servants would
hear it
  what was the meaning of the mes-
sage you sent me
  i never sent you any message sir
utterly exasperated johnny turned
to the door he could not understand
why bradley should deny having sent
the note if he really did send it if he
had not who had and why was the
old butlers name signed to it the re-
porter jerked his note-pad from his
pocket and laid it before bradley
  write a few lines on there he re-
quested and sign your name i want
to compare it with that note i received
this morning
  the butler did as suggs commanded
he seemed so utterly wearied that his
power of resistance was burned out
johnny pocketed the note said a cheer-
ful good-bye and went down the corri-
dor with the warden he felt like a
man in a labyrinth striving desperately
to reach the center only to find himself
as far away as ever the center he
sought was the solution to the triple
murder in the guerney house his in-
itial incentive to spur up his fathers
regard had been supplanted by another
he wanted to scatter the black shadows
enveloping mildred guerney and re-
gain for her the fortune that was right-
fully hers
  johnny headed at once for the star
office things were in full blast there
and no one paid any particular attention
to him as he dived at his desk the let-
ter he had received that morning was
black shadows

flattened out under an ink-well and an-
other lay beside it this one was un-
signed and merely bore the words
page ninety-two paragraph three
he opened the first letter and read it
again
      probably the perculiarity of this will
   strike you at once if you would do
   me a-favor when you hear of my death
   --and i feel that the end is not far-
   will you have my body disposed of as
   was that of gustave edmonson who
   wrote the psychology of the work-
   ing classes
  johnny grinned the second note
cleared up in an absurdly simple way
the puzzle the first one had created
his correspondent wanted him to read
page ninety-two paragraph three of
the pyschology of the working
classes he called for a copy-boy
and sent him for the book-the one he
had consulted that morning having been
returned to the library
  then he laid out the two notes de-
spite the brevity of the second one it
was easy to see that the chirography
was identical with that of the first
then suggs flattened out the paper he
had requested bradley to write it was
identical with that of the other two
notes
  why had the old butler denied writing
them 
  the copy-boy came back presently
with edmonsons masterpiece johnny
seized it eagerly and opened it at page
ninety-two in paragraph three he
found this
  the newest  type of family servant
is the chauffeur and he presents a most
absorbing psychological study he is
usually a step ahead of the other serv-
ants mentally and in consequence be-
comes more valuable or more danger-
ous as his character is inclined i recall
quite vividly the murder of mr
farnsworth lee by his chauffeur-a
man of-
  johnny threw down the book with an
exclamation of delight
  hawker he said to himself
hawker
chapter vi
  that letter brought to a head the
vague suspicions that had been germinat-
ing in suggs mind but after all
proof was needed to link the chauffeur
with the triple murder without it the
black shadow would still hang over mil-
dred guerney
  before leaving johnny stopped in his
fathers office the elder suggs leaned
back in his swivel chair and surveyed
his son
  well my boy he asked cheerfully-
how is the sherlock holmes business
coming along
  the reporter sat down on his fathers
desk and grinned at him if you think
 have been idle youve another guess
coming governor that scoop we have
on the murder of jones and tama
aping is worth the time ive spent on
the case isnt it
  without question have a cigar
and consider your salary raised a dollar
a week but im interested in the de-
tective side of the case-your system of
solving criminal mysteries have you
deduced anything today
  careless of his fathers chaffing
johnny sat swinging his legs his eyes
fixed on some papers on the desk then
he looked up square into the others
eyes
  yes i have deduced sometlaing dad
and if it isnt asking too much id like
an explanation from you why did
you send me those two notes and sign
bradleys name
  how may i ask did you connect me
with that incident 
  you have an old letter of bradleys
there on your desk and a sheet of paper
covered with imitations of his chirog-

black shadows
raphy you are something of a hand-
writing expert so it wasnt hard to
guess but what is the big idea
  the older man tossed away his cigar
and laughed
  you are doing so well on this son
that i wanted to help yet still keep you
puzzled i thought you would be able
to follow that rather broad clue of mine
but i didnt want you to know that i
left it have you seen bradley
  of course the old fellow was all
fussed up when i wanted to know what
his message meant he hadnt any idea
of what i was talking about
  the editor of the star chuckled
i suppose so there isnt any doubt
in my mind that he is not implicated in
this affair when things are cleared up
ill take care of him now i want you
to go out and check up on hawker
no doubt he has what he thinks is a
puncture-proof alibi i suspected hawk-
er when i learned- that he had a bank
balance in excess of one hundred thou-
sand dollars that was sufficient proof
that he isnt an ordinary chauffeur so
far as i know he had no motive in
killing either guerney or jones
  yes he had johnny asserted then
he repeated the story hawker had told
him an hour ago now ive mapped
out a plan to catch him napping if
youll co-operate with me i think we
can put it across
  when he had finished his explanation
the elder suggs whistled it sounds
good to me ill get busy on my end
now you chase out and check up every
minute of his time
  johnny followed instructions but at
the close of his investigation found him-
self up against the same blank wall that
had blocked him when he checked up
on jones day the other chauffeurs at
the st regis had played poker with
hawker until jones had summoned him
that was at ten minutes to one and the
car had been marked out of the garage
five minutes later the traffic officer
on duty in the park that afternoon dis-
tinctly remembered seeing the rolls-
royce at about one-fifteen he knew
mr jones personally and that gentle-
man stopped and gave him some cigars
the reason that he remembered the
time was that jones asked him saying
his watch had stopped and the clock in
the car was broken cursed a bit at
the carelessness of the chauffeur in al-
lowing it to happen too
  miss daisy graelis reiterated her
statement that jones had arrived at two-
thirty and that the chauffeur was with
him she did not see hawker again
until four when he returned to the am-
bassadeur for them however the
manager of a poolroom across the street
from the hotel stated that hawker-
who was an old customer of the place
-had taken a table at three oclock
and had not left until five minutes to
four that accounted for his time just
as j sylvester jones had been ac-
counted for
  johnny puzzled over that he was
certain there was something in plain
sight that he should see-something
that would let him get a hand on
hawker and suddenly it popped into
his mind why hadnt he thought of
that before it was just as evident at
first as it was now
  now if his plan to force a confes-
sion from the chauffeur-assuming that
he was guilty-succeeded everything
would be all right if hawker really
had killed strickland guerney he had
left no clue and he knew it on the
other hand every murderer has a rest-
less conscience-nerves that may be
startled into betraying him so johnny
felt fairly hopeful
  he called mildred guerney on the
telephone and outlined his plan to her
the girl-who had come to trust him
implicitly-agreed to every detail then
johnny paid a visit to hawker at the
black shadows

st regis garage after a flying visit
to the star office
  the crooked-nosed chauffeur took the
reporter to his room and asked him
what he wanted
  til tell you said suggs im up
against it if my father knew that i
was up to my ears in a stock-market
tangle hed kick me out of the house
naturally im not anxious to pass up
the prospects of inheriting his money
but i need something to tide me over
right now
  why come to me
  because you can help me
  hawker began to worry a creased bit
of ipaper stealthy eyes on the floor he
was studying johnnys mental capacity
trying to figure out too just how far
he would go finally he shrugged his
shoulders i dont know what you
mean
  the reporter hitched his chair a bit
closer yes you do i happen to
know that you have a hundred thousand
dollars in the cathedral national bank
i want a slice of it
  can you advance any reason why i
should give it to you hawker had
dropped his servile air and spoke out
with a sharp assurance new to him
  several of them but there is one in
particular that will interest you
  the chauffeurs blood-shot eyes nar-
rowed and his fingers drummed uneas-
ily on the arm of his chair
  what is it
  your alibi explained johnny care-
fully is apparently everything that
could be desired the police take it at
its face value anyway but zvhat were
vou doing between the hours of one-
fifteen when the traffic policeman rec-
ognised you in the park and two-thirty
when you drove jones to miss graclis
apartment
  hawker sprang to his feet with a
sharp cry of anger but johnny did not
shift his slouching position in his chair
  there is no need for melodramatics
he said you know what i mean
what do you want
  ah the cat was out now suggs did
not move but the muscles of his face re-
laxed and he drew a deep silent breath
fifteen thousand dollars
  you are high priced
  oh very returned the reporter
with a swagger
  and what could i expect in return
for that
  listen if the police ever think of
that lost hour theyll be down on you
quicker than a thousand bricks you
have a chance to get old guemeys
money there are just two obstacles
the first one ive just mentioned the
second is guerneys daughter she is
in the city
  he had expected the chauffeur to be
astounded instead hawker merely
scowled and said i know it
  you know it what are you going
to do about it
  hawker blinked at him if you ex-
pect to get any money from me youd
better make some suggestions yourself
i can keep the thoughts of that dun-
derhead jamieson turned away from
you entirely suggs asserted that is
if i get the money
  what about this guerney girl
johnny looked at hawker with a cold-
ly impassive face there is only one
thing to do isnt there
  yes said the chauffeur desperately
well have to put her out of the way
we
  yes you too you dont trust me
and i dont trust you so far well and
good everythings even and no one
hurt but if we do the job together
one cant hold the other up
  johnny pretended to consider that
offer of course was the one he had
been attempting to get out of the chauf-
feur the reporter knew something of
psychology he knew the state hawk-

black shadows
  while he was striding along the
street chuckling to himself the chauf-
feur was staring dumbly at the great
black headlines that blazoned forth his
financial wreckage
ers nerves would be in when he came to
do this cold-blooded crime and with
proper coaching the man would tell
enough to place the noose around his
neck suggs had an inborn hatred of
falsehood but the remorseless require-
ments of the profession he was tempo-
rarily following forced the deception he
was practicing to lie in the line of
duty is sometimes a disagreeable neces-
sity-and this was for mildred
  will you do this asked hawker
  and ill get the fifteen thousand
  of course
  all right said johnny slowly but
i cant understand why you didnt do
something yourself when you knew she
was in town
 hawker scowled i sent black
allen out to trap her but someone
butted in on the affair and gave allen
a handy beating the girl got away
and is hiding somewhere it will be
necessary to find her first
  i know where she is
  you do
 of course what kind of a re-
porter do you think i am ive kept
track of everyone in this case first and
last heres my plan do you know
where  phillips street is
  hawker nodded
  the house belonged to guerneys
wife and now of course belongs to
the daughter ill get her there by a
fake note and then-well it isnt pleas-
ant to talk of those things
  what time do you want me there
asked hawker
  there was a sound of light footsteps
in the hall
  paper cried a piping juvenile
voice evenin star
  at twelve on the dot said suggs
hurriedly opening the door the news-
boy thrust in a folded copy of the sheet
which johnny passed over to hawker
at twelve dont forget and he dis-
appeared down the stairway
cathedral national bank closes its
 doors-looted by officers is
report-not a dollar will
be realized by creditors
chapter vii
  suggs called up the star office
found that his father had gone home
and immediately followed him there
dinner had been served long ago arid
his mother and sisters had gone to the
theatre the master of the house was
in his room dressing johnny went up
at once
  well asked the owner of the
star shaking out his dinner jacket
and lying it across a chair how did
your wonderful scheme work out
immense we have him trapped i
think regard your son old war horse
hes a criminal i engaged in a con-
spiracy with hawker-at his own sug-
gestion mind you-that we put mildred
guerney out of the way he is to meet
me at  phillips street at twelve
oclock tonight i am supposed to have
lured the girl there gad what a cold
calculating devil he is
  what about that single copy of the
star that i had printed telling of the
failure of the cathedral national
bank
  it was delivered just as i left
laughed johnny and if i know any-
thing of human nature it will be the
final jarring punch that will make
hawker reckless of consequences
hell talk-and an uncontrolled tongue
has been the downfall of more criminals
than all the detectives in the world
the older man finished brushing his
hair and picked up his waistcoat it
black shadows

was a clever idea son but i would like
to get that paper back again the bank
is as solvent as it ever was but if that
fake notice ever came to the attention of
the president i would find myself the
defendant in a suit for damages how-
ever its in a good cause so i wont
worry about that have you explained
matters to miss guerney
  yes
  and she is willing to carry out her
share in the affair
  of course
  she must trust you implicitly son
i know that you are no don juan but
she is an unsophisticated girl be care-
ful
  johnns cheeks began to burn and he
gave his father an uncomfortable look
silence fell and he sat down his boyish
face resting on his hands the elder
suggs looked at him curiously and be-
gan to change his collar
  do you-ah-love her he asked
  yes what do you think this case
means to me i am not a professional
detective-the trapping of the man who
killed that selfish gourmand guerney
and jones and the dayak means nothing
to me except that it will lift the black
shadow from the girl i love
  mr suggs had finished dressing
johnny looked at his watch picked up
his hat and gloves and rose
  it is ten oclock he said in a curi-
ously quiet voice i am ready if you
are
  together they went downstairs the
suggs limousine was waiting outside
when they reached the drawing-
room a sudden thought struck the
reporter
  i dont think we had better go to-
gether dad hawker isnt a servant
normally he is clever enough and
suspicious enough to watch this house to
see what i do you go in the machine
drive around town a bit then pick up
jamieson and otoole and bierhalter
if they will let him go he saw the be-
ginning of this affair and it is only fair
that he should see the finish too ill
meet mildred near the phillips street
address have the police slip in the
back way and make sure that hawker
does not see them
  right you are son said the older
man he took the boys hand in an
affectionate grip im with you all the
way understand-all the way and at
a pinch i dont imagine that i would
make such a bad father-in-law
  he laughed relinquished his grip
the door banged behind his burly fig-
ure
  a few minutes later johnny too
went out
  he met mildred a few blocks from
the phillips street house in her
pretty soft gown with a tint of blue
ribbon at neck and shoulder she seemed
so very young and lovable that suggs
heart set up a disturbed double drum-
ming
  i am glad you are here she whis-
pered i was afraid that something
had happened to prevent it
  nothing could prevent-that
oh she said faintly then are
we to go in now
  yes they were to go in it being
nearly time for hawker to appear
mildred had the key to the place they
entered the dim old-fashioned back
parlor where they were to keep their
vigil had either been alone it would
have been dreary waiting-a trifle
eerie perhaps-but being together made
all the difference in the world they
burned too with the gusty thrill of the
man-hunter a sensation that nothing
else can counterfeit
  at last the big clock in the corner
church boomed twelve solemn heavy
strokes their ponderous reverbera-
tions had scarcely ceased when the
opening and closing of the front door
sounded johnny peered hastily into

black shadows
the dining-room and received a reassur-
ing hiss from lieutenant jamieson
  the stage was set for the entrance of
the principal actor
  suggs rose and opened the parlor
door to admit hawker
  the chauffeur was flushed with
drink apparently he had sought to
stiffen a wavering courage with numer-
ous libations and had only succeeded in
forcing the throbbing color into his
cheeks and a heaviness into his tongue
  when i saw how dark the place was
i didnt know but what you had double-
crossed me he snorted
  you didnt think i would have it lit
up like a church did you
  hawker grunted sullenly
  well said the reporter casually
here is miss guerney to talk that mat-
ter over with you i suppose i get that
fifteen thousand dont i
  the other took his copy of the star
from a pocket and tossed it to suggs
  look at that he said thickly im
broke-havent a penny in the world
but dont you worry after i inherit
old guerneys money ill double your
stake
  what do you mean demanded the
girl
  hawker focussed her with his red-
rimmed eyes i had a hundred thou-
sand dollars in the cathedral bank-
my share of the money that jones and
i blackmailed out of old fools like
vanderduynck and castleton it went
broke and took every penny i own
but im going to get guerneys money
-when youre out of the way-aint i
suggs so were going to get rid of
you very politely i didnt know if i
could trust suggs at first but my nerve
was gone and i couldnt put anything
over alone so were going to kill you
together-kill you the way jones and
guerney and the dayak were killed
  he fumbled in his hip pocket for a
weapon
  before his fingers had closed on the
butt johnny leaped forward and the
knuckles of his right fist caught the
chauffeur on the mouth hawker
reeled back spluttering an oath through
his bleeding lips
  before hawker had recovered his
balance the dining-room door opened
and closed and jamieson stood with his
broad back against it the blue coat
and brass buttons startled hawker into
instant sobriety he glared around
like a trapped wild beast a deadly
fear was stamped on his bloodless face
  whats the meaning of this he
demanded
  it means that weve caught the
murderer of strickland guerney said
the police lieutenant importantly you
should know that you couldnt deceive
us clever as you are
  i didnt kill guerney before god i
didnt
  no who did then
  jones did it he planned it all and
carried it out himself i helped him
with his alibi that was all his date
with daisy graelis-the ride through
the park-everything was done to cover
up his time the only bit unaccounted
for by anyone but me was between one-
fifteen when the traffic officer in the
park recognized us and two-thirty
when jones went to miss graelis apart-
ment he disguised himself in overalls
and a slouch hat smeared himself with
soot and let himself in through the
area way
  he had a key to the old mans study
-let himself in there were only a
few words exchanged then jones shot
him with an automatic equipped with a
silencer
  why old guerney gave him lots
of money
  it was guerneys daughter jones
learned that she was in town he
heard that the old man had decided on
a reconciliation and he knew that he
black shadows

would have to act quickly to prevent the
will from being changed
   then you killed jones charged
jamieson his ruddy face deepening in
color
  johnny laughed youre wrong
again lieutenant he did not kill
jones
  the officer scowled how do you
figure that out
  the reported waved a hand toward
hawkers shrunken body jones was
killed before the dayak i know be-
cause i was in that room and found her
body he was a fairly large man-
weighed at least one hundred and
seventy pounds do you imagine for
an instant that hawker could have
lifted that body and jammed it up into
the chimney the way wre found it  it
took a tremendously strong man to do
that and one who had a rather primitive
way of hiding his crimes its my guess
that tama aping killed mr jones and
that hawker in turn finished the
dayak am i right hawker
  the chauffeur gave him a malignant
glance but evidently concluded that he
could best help himself by making a
clean breast of everything
  i did kill the dayak but it was in
self-defense he said hoarsely he
had murdered jones and hid himself-
i dont know where he probably mis-
took jones for guerney whom he
hated and then frightened crammed
the body up the chimney i had fol-
lowed jones to the house when he
didnt come out i entered the dayak
made for me with that murderous knife
of his-so i shot him that isnt mur-
der lieutenant you cant do any-
thing to me for that
  jamieson laughed savagely per-
haps not but youre a bad egg hawker
-a bad egg-just as rotten in your
heart as guerney was but you con-
spired to kill his daughter and youve
confessed to blackmailing a number of
prominent men so if you wiggle out of
the penalty for killing that greasy
dayak youre going to do time on those
other charges take him away
otoole the wagon is waiting out-
side
  there was a clink of steel as the
handcuffs circled the chauffeurs wrists
he gave johnny a murderous glance
from his bloodshot eyes and walked out
beside the detective
  lieutenant jamieson rubbed his thick
damp palms well i flatter myself
that we put that over rather cleverly
eh suggs you know for a bit i was
worried-what with mullaney getting
away last month and all-
  the reporter smothered a smile
hidden by the folds of mildreds dress
he was holding the girls hand and a
wonderful feeling of content suffused
him he did not particularly desire any
credit for snaring a criminal he had
succeeded in what he set out to do that
was sufficient
  yes pretty cleverly repeated
jamieson meaningly
  oh yes said johnny turning
away the police of this town arent to
be hood winked and tomorrow the
star will give all due credit to police
lieutenant jamieson and now mil-
dred-er-miss guerney-
  her hand tightened on his
  call me mildred-as long as you
like she whispered
the end
the choice
 by eugene guillaume
he hesitatingly walked up the
broad stone steps he was not
yet used to the silent dignity of
the hospital atmosphere
  inside he took off his soft hat
crushed it in his hand and instinctively
softened his footfalls as he stepped to
the information desk
  mrs-el-follis
the girl silently plugged in the
switchboard a question an answer
  corridor b room  they are wait-
ing for you she said
  softly almost on tiptoe he walked
down the long corridor passing a nurse
in the light blue white trimmed uni-
form distinctive of the hospital turned
to the right and lightly tapped at a
door on which the figure  appeared
  a nurse opened the door looked at
him turned and beckoned to someone
in the room
  a physician young alert came to the
door glanced at him a moment came
out and closed the door behind him
  the man before him nervously mois-
tened his lips
  the physician looked at him keenly
the mans eyes returned the look ques-
tioningly
  the times almost here said the
physician its serious-the mother
or the baby ive told her she says
to speak to you
  a lightning expression passed over
the mans face the physicians boring
gaze noted but did not fathom it
  may i see her
  yes-but only for a minute the
physician turned and opened the door
the man advanced haltingly in the

 semi-darkness to the bedside
 john and two weak arms reached
 up and clasped him around the neck
 the doctor says- her voice choked
 the doctor says she whispered in
 weak tones in his ear that it is baby-
 or me
 a flash of pain winced her face and
 she paused as it took her breath
 in a moment
 i told him id leave it to you she
 whispered as it passed
 my brave girl my brave girl i
 want you-of course i want you he
 answered low voiced but vibrant
 a look of ineffable joy came over her
 face
 he wants me she said feebly
 bright-eyed joy-flushed to the physi-
 cian standing at the bedside hes
 come back at last-and he wants me
 a spasm of pain convulsed her
 the physician leaned over quickly
 and turned to the table of instruments
 at his side
 the nurse gently took the mans arm
 and led him to the door even in her
 pain the womans eyes lovingly fol-
 lowed him
 the door closed a moment passed
 it opened again and the mans head
 appeared inside
 doctor he whispered softly
 the physician turned looked walked
 to the door the man beckoned
 silently and the physician went outside
 closing the door quietly behind him
 well he questioned
 save the baby the man replied
 the physician stared at him   
 turned and re-entered the room
the long arm of god
by ward sterling
  in a rock-bound gulch half-buried un-
  der the sands of summer covered
  beneath ten feet of snow in winter
  six skeletons lie grinning mockingly
  in the hollow skulls of two are smooth
  round holes in one a tiny leaden pellet
  leaps and bumps with each heave and
  groan of the sun-kissed ice in spring
  the whitened ribs of two are seamed
  and scarred as by a knife upon the
  sixth there is no mark nor comes there
  any answering rattle when some loath-
  some reptile scurrying from its lair
  amongst the rocks and crevices jars
  against the whitened shell that once en-
  cased as foul a brain as eer polluted
  gods green footstool it lies far apart
  from the others denied even in death
  the solace of their companionship
     it is of the tenant of that sixth grim
  remnant gazing hollow-eyed toward
  the heavens it can never enter that this
  story is written the flesh that once
  covered his weather-bleached bones has
  long since been carried away by carrion
  birds his malignant soul is now frying
  in hell-unless by chance the devil
  fearing the corruption of his powers of
  darkness has denied the spirit ad-
   mittance
    he mocked god and spit upon his
  commandments and the long arm of
  god reached out and found him-even
  in the chill cold arctic hell where he
  had hidden himself away
i
     lee was the first to die they found
  him a month after they had discovered
  that they were rich-cold and stiff his
  face twisted into an indescribable gri-
  mace as if he had died in awful
  agony yet there had been no outcry
  nor was there any mark upon his body
  to show how he had been struck down
  the six of them-lee the profane
halligan the religious mason the stu-
dent  wentworth ill-tempered and
moody kelly the hot-blooded celt and
good-natured plodding old drew-
were from the same mid-western town 
they had grown up together attended
the same school soldiered in the same
squad the same girl had driven them
to the land of long winters to seek their
fortune and smarting under the same
misfortune they had been drawn to-
gether forgetting for the time their
differences sharing one anothers dan-
gers living out of a common purse
laughing at hardships-yet each praying
that he might be the one upon whom
fortunes smile would fall-buoyed up
by the memory of a beautiful girl far
far from their adopted home
  after a fashion they were happy
they were filled with primitive vigor
and pulsing with life they lived con-
stant romances and did not know it
for such is the way of the far coun-
tries and the lure of the north had
gripped their heartstrings
  they had been prospecting without
results all summer when they chanced
upon the unmapped blind canyon which
was destined to be their burial place
following the noisy little creek up the
gulch to the spot where it bubbled from
the side of the rocky wall which blocked
the farther end of the canyon between
two gray grim mountains they decided
to hole in for the winter
  there were signs of gold everywhere


the long arm of god
a cabin old and weatherbeaten-one
of the unsolved mysteries of the ever-
mysterious north-stood ready for
their occupancy with a small amount of
repairing near by were a dozen mounds
-grim reminders of a tragic past in
the cabin were bags filled with nuggets
their coverings rotted away the whole
place breathed of mystery-of mystery
and treasure untold wood was plenti-
ful and game was abundant
  halligan and lee were sent back
for supplies the others divided
their time between prospecting the
gulch and putting in shape their shack
-a four-roomed affair-for they in-
tended spending the winter in comfort
  two weeks after the return of the
two the partners awoke to the realiza-
tion that they were rich before they
could even estimate the extent of their
find winter arrived with ite long cold
nights burying the old cabin almost to
the eaves under a mass of snow which
filled the gulch tying them up effectu-
ally for the remainder of the season
  there is no stronger test of friend-
ship than the placing of strong vigorous
men for several long weary months in
enforced confinement with little to do
save eat and sleep forced to gaze at
each other day after day they are apt
to fall into a physical lethargy which
eventually creates a nervous tension like
nothing else in the world petty quar-
rels become serious matters molehills
are magnified into mountains they
grow to hate the sight of each other-
to become suspicious of what under
other circumstances would not be no-
ticed and when each looks upon his
companions as his rivals for the hand
of a beautiful woman hell is bound to
break loose sooner or later it is as
inevitable as fate
ii
  when they found the grisly horror
that was lee lying stark and stiff in
his bunk gazing glassy-eyed toward
the ceiling there was no thought of foul
play it was halligan who in straight-
ening out the cold clinched fingers dis-
covered the tiny thread of gray wool in
the doubled-up fist and called the at-
tention of the others to it
  wentworth was the owner of the only
gray shirt in the camp the others wore
khaki or blue it had been a cold night
and he had slept in it instantly all eyes
were turned upon him although no
word was spoken
  he turned upon his silent accusers
his lips drawn back in a wolfish snarl
damn it if you think i done it
say so he growled if i killed him
how did i do it-and when  you hal-
ligan slept in the same room with us
halligan shook his head sadly
  when i went to bed the two of you
and kelly were soldering that hole in
the old coffee-pot i went to sleep be-
fore either of you turned in
  kelly looked at halligan angrily
then cast a sympathetic glance at went-
worth
  im sorry to say boys that i hit
the hay before the other two i wish
now that i hadnt because im confident
that if lee was killed-and i dont think
that he was-it wasnt wentworth that
done it hes not that stripe in fact
he hastened on none of the bunch is
wentwordi snorted
  keep your blasted sympathy to your-
self i dont want it he growled
  halligan shook his jiead mournfully 
its the visitation of god upon lee
for his blasphemy he muttered i
warned him against it many a time-
poor boy
  they sat around all day discussing
theircompanions sudden taking away-
all but wentworth he sat alone in a
corner silently nursing his grievances
they had searched the body there was
not a mark upon it the other four
were loud in their statements that lee
 he cocked the weapon and with his finger on the trigger waited for the others to
                         settle their argument-page 


the long arm of god
must have died a natural death but
there was a feeling of coldness-an in-
describable something that cast a pall
over them all-a feeling toward their
once-trusted comrade-a feeling that
the long lonely days of idleness and
soundless nights of the past now mag-
nified into an unspoken suspicion
  late in the afternoon they carried
lees body up the gulch a few yards
and buried it in a shallow grave dug in
the ice and snow where it would have
to lie until spring opened up again the
ground was frozen too hard to dig a
grave being covered by a dozen feet of
hard-packed snow and ice
 only wentworth remained away
from the simple funeral sitting glumly
by himself inside the cabin while hal-
ligan mumbled brokenly as much as he
could remember of the burial service
  it was late when they retired that
night all but wentworth he refused
to eat any supper throwing himself
onto his bunk immediately after the
others had finished eating where he lay
scowling his eyes staring into vacancy
ill
  they slept fitfully it was nearly
morning when they were awakened by
the sharp explosion of a gun they
leaped to their feet and one of them
struck a match and lighted a flickering
tallow candle
  wentworth lay dead in his blankets
over him hung a pall of acrid smoke
  he lay upon his back a bullet hole in
his temple his lips drawn back in the
same wolfish snarl he had worn during
the day on the floor beside him where
it had dropped from his nerveless hand
lay his revolver
  next morning they buried him in the
snow beside the man who they were
now sure had been his victim and
once more it was halligan who was
called upon to say a prayer
  again he repeated his warning
  cant you see boys he mourned
that the lord visited his wrath upon
wentworth for his sins-just as he did
upon lee a mans evil deeds will find
him out its a warning for you all to
repent before its too late
  there was no work done that day
even the dishes were allowed to go
greasy and unwashed while they dis-
cussed again and again the various
phases of the second tragedy that had
befallen their little community went-
worth had never been popular with the
others his moroseness and general tone
of surly indifference to everything keep-
ing him from being the general favorite
that the profane but good-natured lee
had been yet it was hard to believe
that he had stooped to murder
  as usual it was halligan the born
leader who aroused them from their
apathy putting the others to cleaning
up the dishes he cooked a hasty supper
and compelled the three to eat with him
  theres no use getting the doldrums
he admonished them theyre dead
and sitting around mooning wont bring
em back the lord giveth and the
lord taketh away of course its up to
us to see that their heirs get their share
of the mine after weve taken our wages
out for working it when weve fed
and cleaned up the shack well have a
game of cards and turn in early i
for one am sleepy
  so were they all for within an hour
after they had eaten the four of them
were yawning vigorously they crawled
into their bunks halligan who refused
to sleep in the room where lee and
wentworth had met their deaths climb-
ing into a spare bunk with the others
  mason was the first to awaken next
morning he shouted for the others as
he leaped out of his blankets and
crawled into hiif clothes replenishing
the long arm of god

the logs in the fireplace in the living-
room he again yelled at the other three
and turned his attention to breakfast
   a second later a loud cry from kelly
brought halligan to his feet while
mason ran in from the outer room
  for drew lay dead in his bunk be-
tween his ribs buried to the hilt was
a hunting-knife and it was masons
knife
iv
  kelly carefully drew the knife from
the wound and looked at the initials
carved on the handle
   so twas you after all was it you
skunk he snarled at mason you
with your damned sneaking ways and
your smooth oily manner eh though
why you were fool enough to leave your
knife stickin in him is what i cant
understand scared away were you
   mason stepped back a pace a look of
amazement on his proud face i swear
by the ever-living god boys that i am
innocent he declared why would
i kill drew-
  why-yes why  snorted kelly his
eyes glittering for the same reason
that you killed lee and threw the blame
for it onto poor wentworth damn your
soul i suppose that halligan and i
were to be the next eh  he went on
with us out of the way youd be a
rich man and then you could go back
and marry cora hunter oh im no
fool
   halligan sitting on the edge of his
bunk putting on his moccasins said
nothing kelly his celtic temper leap-
ing to the surface was intensely angry
mason too was a man of hot passions
although he held them under better re-
straint than did the irishman he took
a half-step toward his accuser
  kelly-and halligan he began in
a level voice i didnt kill drew nor
had i a hand in the death of lee its
     b m-sept-
just as much of a mystery to me how
my knife got there as it is to you
   tis no mystery to me snapped
kelly you put it there you cur
youre a damned liar
  kelly leaped upon him the knife he
still held in his hand upraised masons
fist met him half-way striking him
squarely in the face but failing to stop
his rush
  with a lurid oath the burly irishman
jabbed the weapon into the others side
half a dozen times with his bare fists
mason fought the other as best he could
for a second or two his fingers
clutched weakly about his antagonists
windpipe he struggled blindly for a
second fumbling feebly for a hold
then his knees doubled under him and
with a dull moan he sank to the floor
at kellys feet
  without a sign of undue haste hal-
ligan buckled his belt and holster about
his waist coolly he unbuttoned the
holster and drew the gun he cocked
the weapon and with his finger on the
trigger waited for the others to settle
their argument
  did you get him he asked as kelly
stepped back and wiped the blood from
his streaming nose
  yes an im damned glad of it-
the swine
  before he could turn around halli-
gan placed the muzzle of his gun against
the back of the irishmans head and
pulled the trigger a dazed expression
crept over kellys face the knife
dropped from his hand then he fell in
a heap across the body of his late antag-
onist
  halligan replaced the weapon in its
holster and felt of the irishmans heart
assuring himself that it had ceased to
beat he raised his eyes to mason who
was staring at him dazedly
  you saved my life halligan the
wounded man muttered thickly but
you took so long doing it that he got me

the long arm of god
anyway much obliged-just-same
  halligan grinned
  if i did im sorry he remarked
cheerfully  cause then ill have to
finish you myself it wouldnt do for
you to live you see because you know
too much and besides i want every-
thing for myself-the girl and the
money both
  the dying man looked at him curi-
ously you dont mean that it was
you halligan great god and i
never suspected
  halligan sat down on the edge of his
bunk and laughed good-humoredly as he
unbuckled his gun and threw it across
the foot of the bed
  i dont mind telling you about it
he said quietly because youll soon be
where you can never tell
   he rolled a cigarette and lighting it
inhaled a whiff before he continued
you see mason i figured out long
ago that as soon as we struck it rich-
and i felt sure that we would sooner
or later-it would be a survival of the
fittest i knew that there was no chance
for any of us with cora until we had
money shes a selfish little devil but
shes worth fighting for and with all
of us rich we would be just where we
started but now itll be me alone-
just me
  when we struck pay here you re-
member it was me that suggested put-
ting in here for the winter i knew that
it would be easy for me to plant the seed
of suspicion in all of you for deep
down in your hearts you all felt as i
did and each one of you suspected the
other and you were as jealous as a
bunch of chorus girls
  wentworth killed lee all right i
watched him do it from the other room
where i was supposed to be asleep i
suggested the idea of it to him without
him knowing it several days before he
and i were doing a job of soldering and
i told him a story i got from my grand-
mother-about a man who had mur-
dered ms wife by pouring a drop of hot
lead in her ear
   after kelly turned in that night lee
and wentworth sat up soldering you re-
member finally lee dropped off to
sleep with his head on the table it was
too good an opportunity for wentworth
to miss-for he hated lees guts-so
he drops a bit of the hot solder into
lees ear he died without a struggle
as i knew he would-for the infernal
stuff paralyzes every faculty after-
ward wentworth took off his boots and
sneaked in to see if we were asleep
finding that we were he carried lee in
and laid him on his bunk
  you remember how wentworth tore
his shirt on a nail there by the door i
recollected that there was a scrap of
wool hanging onto it when went-
worth went back into the other room to
put away his tools i jumped out took
the little pipce of wool from the nail
and got it into lees clenched fingers
and jumped back into bed before went-
worth returned pretty smooth eh
  wentworth couldnt stand the gaff
he imagined that i knew that he had
killed lee so he killed himself
  mason groaned
  i killed wentworth he blurted out
you told me that he had-that hehe
-about what he done to-to cora i
saw that this was a good opportunity to
get rid of him and let you fellows think
he had done it himself you put me up
to it you devil
  halligan laughed
  so it was you after all eh he
chuckled i knew that you had swal-
lowed my little story ibut ill confess
that i didnt think you would get busy
so quick
  but the letter you showed me from
her-from cora
  halligan chuckled again mason i
dont mind telling you that when i went
after supplies with lee i fijced up five
the long arm of god

letters all identical except the names
i put one of your names in each letter
i showed each one of you a different let-
ter playing each one of you against the
other thats why kelly knifed you
he didnt care a cuss for drew-he was
itching for an opportunity to get you
see i stuck drew myself using your
knife to throw suspicion on you know-
ing that it would start the irishman
where i miscalculated was in thinking
that youd be armed i didnt want to
stain my own hands with murder any
more than i had to i put some dope in
all of your grub last night when i got
supper so that i could pull off the stunt
without arousing you
  that idea of mine of playing each
one of you against the other was pretty
slick wasnt it no one knows of the
existence of this blind gulch here ill
have a pretty good nest egg and after
i	marry cora i can always take a run
back here for more if i need it of
course ill bury all of you fellows nice
and shipshape and ill tell them back
home about our separating and each go-
ing in a different direction oh ive
got a fod yarn cooked up all right
the wounded man glared at him
malignantly
  damn you he cried gods long
arm will get you yet-even out here in
the ice and snow of this god-forsaken
country
  halligan smiled god bah if
id believed in such foolishness id
never won out over the rest of you but
i	made you think i did-and thats
how i got the best of you
v
  he arose and stretched himself
then seizing the dead man he dragged
his victim out of doors and buried him
alongside of the others
  mason watched him at his work with
glaring eyes then as he left the room
the wounded man dragged himself
across the few feet that separated him
from the bunk carefully every move-
ment filled with pain he reached up and
took the gun he tried to lift himself
to his feet and felt himself going
  o god he murmured help me-
help me-get him-dont let him get-
away with it help me for coras sake
  he succeeded in getting the weapon
cocked-in hiding it inside his trousers
pocket
  his jaw dropped and with a convul-
sive twitch he died
  halligan finished burying kelly and
returned to the cabin for warmth re-
plenishing the fire he entered the other
room and found mason dead throw-
ing him across his shoulder he staggered
out into the gulch again and laid him
on the snow crust while he hastily
scooped another shallow grave
  he bent over the body to roll it into
the hole as he did so there was a flash
and a report the bullet swept across
his lids searing them with its heat his
eyes were filled with the powder
  blinded sobbing with his misery he
tried to grope his way back to the cabin
he lost his sense of direction he
stumbled and fell arose and stumbled
again his snowshoes dropped from
his feet too miserable to care he
tried to go on without them he broke
through the crust to his waist on and
on he floundered his way whimpering
with pain-chilled to the marrow-
thinking to reach the cabin but ever
getting farther from it
   and finally exhausted blinded freez-
ing he fell into the stupor which marks
the beginning of the end in the land of
eternal snow
  for the sudden cold grasping hold
of the dead body of mason had
hastened rigor mortis the dead fin-
gers stiffening suddenly had tight-
ened about the trigger of the hid-
den revolver
  it zvas the long arm of god
murdershe said quietly at midnight you came upon this earth and at mia-

the sanctum of madame sovio
was drab and tawdry the room
was small and done in faded
blue draperies upon which were
tinsel stars and moons the one win-
dow that overlooked sixth avenue bore
the name of the astrologer in porcelain
letters and the information that her
hours of business were from two oclock
to five daily a broad table that stood
in the center of the room held a plaster
skull and a quantity of astrological
charts other charts were nailed up on
either side of a door which led into an
ante-room the low ceiling had once
been painted to give the impression of
drifting clouds twin gas jets black-
ening it had long past destroyed the
effect the faint though pungent odor
of gin hung on the stirless air
  the owner of the astrology parlor
sat at the center table madame sovio
wore a flowing egyptian kimono pat-
terned extravagantly with the mystic
signs of the zodiac she was old gaunt
and unprepossessing her untidy hair
was wreathed with a greasy veil her
shrewd eyes focused on the financial
page of a morning newspaper from
time to time she stimulated herself with
small quantities of fluid poured from a
square bottle convenient to her elbow
  madame sovio finished a perusal of
the page she read and was turning lan-
guidly to the front sheet of the paper
when she looked up the door of the
outer room had opened and closed with
the practice born of long experience she
placed both bottle and newspaper in a
lower drawer of the table thrust a few
cloves into her toothless mouth and
stood up
  the waiting room of the establish-
ment was even smaller than the inner
room it contained nothing save a
number of rickety chairs and a red-
faced youth who was pinching out a
cigarette ere consigning the stub to a
coat pocket the caller was tall bulky
and unattractive he wore a rusty
brown suit and stained yellow brogans
with bumpy toes a celluloid collar
held a stringy purple cravat from un-
der the sagging peak of a shoddy cap a
low protruding forehead dark crafty
eyes and a loose rapacious mouth were
visible it was evident to madame
sovio that the youth was flotsam cast
up by the turgid rivers of subterranea
  he met her gaze and shuffled for-
ward
  you the one that slides out the dope
on whats gonna happen
  the woman inclined her head
  yes come in
  the visitor stepped into the room
hung with the faded blue draperies
madame sovio closed the door after
him she indicated he should take the
chair opposite her across the table
  do you wish a horoscope or a read-
ing she inquired as he sat down
  he stared
  a spinner on the docks give me the
gab that you had steered him straight
on the bang-tails im due to gay-cat
tonight on something important i
want a frame telling me how my luck is
gonna break
  madame sovio twined her claw fin-
gers together she understood the
youth to mean that some client who had
sought her advice as to making bets on
the races had recommended him to her


planned by the stars
  the stars she began following a
usual procedure plan and compel
their influence falls directly on each
mortal what is planned cannot be
changed a mans planetary destiny is
as inflexible as fate it is fate i
charge one dollar for a reading
  the red-faced youth produced a
crumpled dollar and pushed it across the
table
  give me the dope on how im gonna
make out am i gonna be lucky or not
get the hop working and give me a
buzz should i or shouldnt i 
  the seamy lips of the astrologer came
together
  what is your name  she asked
in a business-like voice what is the
date of your birth upon what
hour of that day or night were you
bom i must know these things
before i read the messages of the heav-
enly bodies - 
  the youth continued to stare at her
for a long minute he muttered the
name of joe carney informed her of
the date of his natal day and without
hesitation said he had been born at the
precise hour of midnight
  madame sovio became engrossed in
a deep study of her charts
  while she bent her gray-crowned
head over the table joe carney settled
back in his chair he glanced about
idly and wrinkled his nose at the fa-
miliar odor of gin that could not be dis-
guised by the perfume of the cloves he
sat patiently until a slight exclamation
moved his eyes to the woman across the
table he was surprised to see she was
staring at a chart with every indication
of horror 
  not one hour of the twenty-four is
propitious the day is ill-omened all
the plentary influences are dark and evil
mars saturn uranus and mercury are
adverse jupiter is in a hostile position
and is ringed with red this is the star
that guides your footsteps through this
constellation its scarlet rim foretells
but one thing
  joe carney met her gaze
  whats that
 madame sovio moved her hand
slightly
  murder she said quietly at
midnight you came upon this earth and
at midnight the stars plan you shall be
removed from it uranus intrudes and
blurs the horoscope i can read no
further that is all
  joe carney laughed harshly
  the hell it is i pay a dollar for
that song and dance give me the
money back youre a robber
  madame sovio pushed the dirty bill
he had laid on the table across to
him
  take it it will bring you no good
you are in the shadow
  the red-faced youth pocketed his
money shrugged with contempt and
slouched out banging the door after
him for an interval the woman sat
motionless fingers picking at the thumb-
marked chart before her
  the red ring she said half-aloud
blood on the stars-murder on
earth-
  emerging onto sixth avenue from
the narrow entrance of the building
housing the two rooms of the star-
reader joe carney laughed under his
breath
  a hell of a spiel he said to him-
self i should get glomed for a bone
to get that bunk dished out  the old
dame is nuts
  he crossed to the west side of sixth
avenue and walked north a firm be-
liever in the black arts he wished he
had not listened to the dock-walloper
who had told him of the astrologer he
could have interviewed a palmist or
crystal-gazer and not wasted his time
he knew nothing and now it was too
late to seek another seer within twen-
ty minutes he had an appointment with
planned by the stars

stanley ray the leader of the duster
band final plans for the nights adven-
tures were to be unfolded to him
  in sight of the shopping district
carney entered a side street he put
a number of avenues behind him passed
under the scaffolding of an overhead
railroad and presently was on the
threshold of the small area of the city
controlled by stanley rays band of
thugs and gangsters tenement houses
stood shoulder to shoulder in flanks of
brick down the slope of the side street
an avenue where freight cars rolled was
visible further distant was the water-
front and the hudson river frowsy
women leaned from countless windows
children played in the gutters the sum-
mer air was dank with the stench of salt
water
  into the avenue where the freight
trains ran joe carney stepped he put
two blocks behind him and presently
came upon a water-front hotel-a build-
ing that had been old when the city was
young joe carney passed through the
hostelrys yawning front door and
moved into a small lobby a few loaf-
ers smoking nauseous pipes played
checkers silently or slumbered loudly
shaggy heads tilted forward on flanneled
chests
  apart from the group brooding over
his cigarette sat a tall heavily built
young man with a dark sinister face in
which was largely written both deter-
mination and courage this man stood
up as carney entered nodded his head
slightly and opened a white-washed door
a few feet back from where he had
been sitting when carney had fol-
lowed him into a small room that was
used as a refuge for drug-peddlers and
their victims he closed the door and
turned the key
  joe carney promptly sat down
  well im here
   stanley ray inclined his head slightly
  so i see he pulled up a chair and
dropped into it listen carefully im
passing you the word that you turn the
job on tenth avenue tonight ive
never told you where youre to go or
what youve to do all that you know
is youve been picked out by me to
swing a deal and keep your peep closed
the frame is set so that all you have
to do is to walk in help yourself and
walk out a half-wit could turn this
without a mistake thats how soft
it is
  joe carney fished in his pocket for
the half-consumed cigarette he lighted
it and inhaled deeply
  i make you lets have it all
stanley ray went to the door and lis-
tened he returned to his chair and
leaned forward he lowered his voice
  limping lou has turned straight-
by request he works for the gas com-
pany tuesday he went to a flat on
tenth avenue to read the cellar meter
in the front basement of the place are
two rooms rented by a woman called
mrs garber lou had finished reading
the meter and was passing out when he
heard a clinking noise it came from
inside mrs garbers front room lou
tried to lpok through the keyhole but
it was plugged so he went out into the
alley and found the side window of the
same room this window was pro-
tected by bars but was open at the top
lou found a barrel stood up on it and
looked through the top of it
  joe carney drew a breath
  what did he see 
  stanley ray leaned still closer
  he saw mrs garber sitting before a
trunk-counting money lou said she
was tying up bales of the green stuff in
old aprons he watched her until she
put the aprons in the trunk filled it to
the top with old clothes and then shut
it up thats what he saw
  joe carney dropped his cigarette to
the floor and ground it out with his heel
what else

planned by the stars
  i stuck a plant up there stanley
ray resumed i found out this mrs
garber is out every afternoon she
makes her money playing the stock mar-
ket its no use trying to get into the
room during the day because the janitor
of the building and a bunch of ginnies
are laying pipe in the cellar i sent the
turk up yesterday he took a fall out
of the bars he filed them to the borte
a couple of pulls will yank them out
the windows always open and you can
go in over the top of it
  joe carney lifted his head
  what time do i go in will the
miser be there when i get to the trunk 
how much long change do i get out of
this
  the leader of the duster band fav-
ored carney with a direct cold stare
  you get what i give you have you
anything to say about it
  before the bland stare of the gangster
king joe carneys eyes wavered and
fell
  nothing he said hastily put me
right on it
  stanley ray smiled faintly
  i found out this mrs garber gets
telephone calls from levys drug store
at a quarter of twelve ill telephone the
drug store and tell them to send for
mrs garber theyll shoot their kike
kid over to the basement youll be in
the alley at quarter of twelve when
she goes out you go in ill stall her on
the wire as long as possible it should
take you just about ten minutes to grab
the dough and exit do you get me
  joe carney reflectively rubbed his
beard-rusty chin
  yes he said laconically
ii
  the night was hot and unstirring
a full moon rode high in a cloudless
sky the dank smell of the river grew
more pronounced the streets were
lined with coatless loungers sprawling
at ease in doorway or on stoop
  joe carney shuffling up tenth ave-
nue searched each store window for a
clock to tell the hour by it could not
be very late the avenue was well filled
-a number of shops were open and
doing business again he regretted some
prophet had not been employed to prog-
nosticate the fortunes attending the en-
terprise in every task he had set out
to accomplish he had been warned in
advance as to the condition of his luck
if he had been told it was not favorable
he had postponed the event and never
once had he been apprehended
  he walked on hands rammed in the
pockets of his coat he eyed the num-
bers of the buildings as he passed them
still searching for a clock growing
aware his destination must be only a
few blocks distant he saw the moon
creep up over the sullen roof-tops and
perceived the canopy of brightly shining
stars he thought of the astrologer of
the early afternoon and the jumble of
her words
  a murder he chuckled touching
the automatic revolver hung under his
left arm swell chance
  two more blocks traversed he came
abreast the building in whose basement
the wealthy mrs garber resided and
at the same minute his eyes fell upon the
face of a clock in a store of the tene-
ment and he started
  the hands of the clock pointed to five
minutes of the midnight hour
  guiltily realizing he had been delin-
quent and heedless of time carney de-
scended a number of steps that led down
into the basement he found himself in
a cement-lined passageway he fol-
lowed it to its termination and found
himself in the clothes-line hung back-
yard in the rear of the building an
alley ran into the backyard presided
over by a lean cat carney removed the
animal from his path with a toe of his
planned by the stars

boot and crouched against the face of
the alleys brick wall ceasing to curse
the vivid moonlight only when a barred
window of translucent glass leaped out
to meet him
  a tingle of anticipation ran through
joe carney he found the same barrel
limping lou had made his observations
from and wheeled it close to the win-
dow he mounted it cautiously and ap-
plied an ear to the aperture in the win-
dows top all was quiet within ob-
viously he decided mrs garber was in
the drug store or on her way to it he
was ten minutes late and would have to
work rapidly
  the window bars yielded instantly to
his grasp he tore them roughly away
one by one when the last bar had been
wrenched loose carney pressed the top
half of the window lower and poked a
head into the inky blackness of the
room low but distinctly he heard the
monotonous ticking of a clock
  satisfied that no menace crouched in
the gloom carney threw a leg over the
sash and lowered himself into the room
  until his eyes could grow accustomed
to the murk he stood motionless a
faint odor of gin assailed his nostrils
faint stirrings tuned his nerves to a
high pitch with a sense of direction
fixed firmly in mind he crept forward
the treasure chest stanley ray had
told him rested to the right against the
rooms north wall as the thought
flashed through his mind his knees came
in contact with some low-set object
his outstretched hands clasped the top
of something he knew immediately was
the trunk and he exhaled a breath of
relief
  the cover of the trunk swung upward
at his touch he felt to make sure that
the connecting arms were firmly fast-
ened and delved into a mass of soft gar-
ments placed layer upon layer these
he dug out and flung to the floor bur-
rowing mole-like to reach the apron-
wrapped treasure the scent of gin
seemed to envelop him he wondered
why this odor should stir odd recollec-
tions-recollections he could not piece
together
  he had pulled the last article of cloth-
ing from the trunk when the door of
the room vibrated with a sudden stac-
cato rapping ere its first echoes
throbbed into silence a nasal voice sup-
planted the loud knocks with an insistent
statement
  mrs garber somebody wants you
on the telephone down at levys i
  - joe carneys hands closed convulsive-
ly the clock he had looked upon had
been fast or the telephone had marred
stanley rays message
  in either case mrs garber must be
within a few feet of him
  the messenger from the drug store
began his rapping again stiff as stone
joe carney sought to think then as
the knocks ceased for the moment he
heard from some quarter close at hand
the creak of a bed a soft footfall-a
sibilant swish that told of a garment
being donned followed at once the
rasp of an opening door a vagrant air
current stirred to new action touched
carneys forehead-cold against the
sweat that had gathered upon it
  breathless questions rushed through
the mind of the intruder should he al-
low the woman to answer the messen-
ger or should he strike before she
reached the door
  another series of footfalls wheeled
him silently about someone was ap-
proaching-had stepped through the
door he thought he could detect a
muffled shape of shadow moving closer
to him the suspense of waiting was
agony a breath caressed his hot face
and a hand touched his arm someone
gasped
  at the same moment he sprang for-
ward
  with a low growl he felt his fingers

planned by he stars
dig deep into a soft stringy throat
eyes glared into his own for all of the
fact she was a woman the figure he
clutched fought desperately carney re-
leased his left hand to bring it down
with crushing force on the jaw of the
struggling figure before he had
crashed it savagely into the upturned
face the woman managed to wrench a
scream from between her lips
  cursing carney struck again he
gripped the throat again with the hand
he had used with hammer force and
shook the woman as a terrier shakes a
rat as if from a distance he heard
fresh raps falling upon the door-the
voice of the messenger
  mrs garber mrs garber
  then silence
  carney relaxed the gripping pressure
of his death-working fingers he found
he was talking but knew not what he
said he had killed a woman but it was
her own fault hot blood pounded
within him-rage and a gloating satis-
faction he felt that at that moment
he wished she possessed the nine
lives of the cat he had kicked
from his path he would strangle
each from her
  and then he realized the apron-
wrapped loot would never be his if he
stood longer clutching the limp figure
he opened his hands the body
slumped to the floor the moon swing-
ing around entered the alley and crept
into the room lighting it up like a pale
arc-lamp carney looked down at the
huddle of his victim
  the woman had fallen on her back
her face was upturned to him-
wreathed with a horrible fixed grin
he stared fascinated eying too
greasy gray hair that seemed strangely
familiar for a full watch-tick he
stared rigid the odor of gin-the
gray hair-the gaunt face painted with
the ghastly moonglare all at once
knowledge flooded him
  mrs garber wore the face of the
madame sovio who had read the stars
for him that afternoon in the sixth ave-
nue room
  murder carney whispered she
had the right dope
  something as he straightened up
stopped the flow of the incoming moon-
light he raised his eyes and turned
them to the window his gaze flashed
and fell upon a helmeted head looking
in over the lowered top of the translu-
cent window his right hand darted
under his jacket and gripped his auto-
matic in some blind dizzy fashion
he managed to drag it out
  but before he could pull the trigger
the yellow glare of an electric torch
smote him directly between the eyes
a voice curt and imperious bade him
throw up his hands carney blinking
like an owl drenched in sunshine fell
back his weapon crept up to firing
position
  then the heavy silence was shattered
by the sound of six shots so rapidly
fired that they merged as one
  the automatic fell from carneys
hand he wondered vaguely if he had
been shot-why his legs seemed to be
melting away cursing again his brain
reeled and scintillated with sparks he
groaned and fell heavily across some-
thing softly yielding   
  the clock that had ticked monoto-
nously whirred and struck the hour of
twelve
fingers from the grave

  there was a presence in the house
quavered martin stacy who had once
spent part of a night there i-i
felt it
  could you see it asked grimstead
  martin shuddered
  no he whispered but i knew it
was there-whatever it was if anyone
sneaked into your room when you were
reading witiout making any noise you
would feel they were there even if you
hadnt seen em-wouldnt you  grim-
stead nodded well it was that same
sort of feeling that came over me in
mrs careys bedroom
  martin stacys story was similar to
the others they had all felt a sinister
presence in mrs careys room and the
feeling had always been followed by
senseless unreasoning terror that made
them flee into the night
  the carey tragedy had been the grim-
mest that had ever occurred in the town
of sedley twenty years before wel-
don carey had brought his bride to the
old carey house which had been built
by a colonial carey and inhabited by
careys ever since selma carey was
beautiful and vivacious and she appeared
to be as madly in love with the old house
and its colonial traditions as she was
with its master
  then came the-tragedy young
mrs carey was found murdered one
morning-strangled to death-and her
husband told incoherently how two bur-
glars had broken into the place at mid-
night one of them had throttled mrs
carey and the other was threatening
him with a revolver when some noise
frightened them away the country-
side was searched for the two men but
they were never apprehended and the
verdict of the coroners jury was that
mrs carey had come to her death at
the hands of a person or persons un-
known
  carey seemed heart-broken after the
tragedy and finally not succeeding in
selling the old house he left it in charge
of a caretaker and went abroad to live
in all these intervening years he had
never returned to his birthplace nor
could anyone be induced to rent the
place	-
  tom grimstead thought as he stood
in front of the carey mansion at dusk
one september afternoon that he had
never seen a more repellent-looking
house there was something indescrib-
ably repugnant about it as if one were
contemplating the corpse of a house
horror surrounded it like a nimbus and
grimsteads first impulse was to walk
hastily away but shaking off the feel-
ing of dread that had settled upon him
like an incubus he resolutely walked up


fingers from the grave
ihe weed-encumbered walk that led to
the front door armed with a key that
he had experienced no difficulty in se-
curing from a cynical real-estate agent
who promptly offered to wager that he
would not stay the night out-a wager
that gri instead as promptly accepted
he carried a handbag that contained a
supply of sandwiches a small auto-
matic half a dozen fat candles a flash-
light and two volumes of poes grisliest
short stories he ironically thought of
these as his ghost props
  but stout-nerved as he was grim-
stead shrank back instinctively as the
front door slammed shut leaving him
in impenetrable darkness this instan-
taneous plunge into blackness was sud-
den enough to daunt anyone and for a
second time that afternoon grimstead
was tempted to abandon his ghost quest
then he reflected that thrills were what
he had come for and he was disgusted
at the realization that he was allowing
his subconscious self to be affected by
the stories he had heard if he were
really a skeptic as he had always prided
himself on being he was on the verge
of the most interesting adventure of his
none-too-dull life so he opened his
handbag by touch alone turned on his
flashlight and took stock of his sur-
roundings
  he was in an old-fashioned living-
room at the far end of which was a
huge open fireplace in front of him
a fine specimen of colonial architecture
in the shape of an imposing staircase
pointed the way to adventure on the
second floor the large room was fully
furnished but a smell of decay and mil-
dew assailed grimsteads nostrils
  the atmosphere was heavy and fetid
odors of bygone days seemed to meet
and commingle and the air held a pene-
trating chill something soft brushed
his face in the semi-gloom and he start-
ed back involuntarily and then laughed
nervously it was a deaths-head moth
  and the creature settled upon the back
of a large upholstered chair its wings
spread wide shivering as the bright ray
from the flashlight illumined its ghastly
markings
  with a little shiver that was not en-
tirely due to the chill of the place grim-
stead started up the stairs in search of
mrs careys bedroom which he had
been told was the front room at the left
of the upper hallway but first he ex-
plored the other rooms finding them all
furnished but reeking with desolation
and decay time had wrought sad
havoc upon objects of inestimable value
to the collector of colonial antiques
  grimstead now turned the handle of
the door that led into the dead womans
bedchamber and found himself in an
ancient boudoir about which still clung
an elusive odor of mignonette and lav-
ender against one side of the wall
was an antique dressing-table but the
surface of the long mirror which had
in bygone days often reflected the fair
image of selma carey was now opaque
blurred over by the film of years near
the dresser was a four-poster bed cov-
ered with a yellowed counterpane and
two pillows were in place at its head
it was hard to believe that no one had
slept there for twenty years
  with the exception of the dust that
covered everything and a dank smell
the room and its furnishings appeared
to have been left as they were on the
day of the tragedy and grimstead found
himself glancing from time to time at
the door of the dressing-room which
was about ten feet from the bed as if
he expected a charming figure in
deshabille to come romping into the
room at any moment
so acute was this impression that he
strode across the room and threw open
the door of the dressing-room peering
curiously within it contained an old-
fashioned tin bathtub the paint from
which was chipped off here and there
fingers from the grave

giving it a dismal look of dilapidation
on a rusty metal towel-rack hung a
rotting hath towel and from a hook in
the wall was suspended a mildewed
dressing-gown that had once been lav-
ender-colored
  with a look of infinite pity grim-
stead closed the door softly behind him
his vivid imagination conjuring up the
picture of a lovely woman with golden
hair cascading to her waist humming a
gay little tune as she prepared for her
bath
  he now set the stage for his lonely
vigil
  lighting one of his fat candles he
placed it upon the dusty dresser in such
a position that itsiame illumined the
bed	
  then he stuck another above the
fireplace on the white marble mantel-
piece
  drawing up a small dressing-table he
placed his third candle upon that and
then he dusted off a comfortable morris
chair with wide arms and placed it
where he could command a view of the
entire room the dressing-table was at
his left within easy reaching distance
and on this he placed his sandwiches
his automatic and his volumes of poe
   satisfied with these strategic arrange-
ments he lit his pipe sank into the big
chair and was soon immersed in the
fall of the house of usher which he
had decided was the proper yarn for
the time the place and the man
  it was so silent in the house that the
scampering of mice in the wainscoting
sounded as loud as the romping of new-
foundland dogs every now and then
one of them would squeal as if it were
being murdered and whenever this hap-
pened grimstead would pause in his
reading and look up with a startled
tenseness expecting to see-he knew
not what the wind wasrising and it
howled and moaned like a tortured
spirit striving with futile hands to force
  an entrance through the rotting eaves
of the ancient house it was an eerie
sound and grimstead found himself
forced to exert all his will-power in
order to concentrate upon the harrow-
ing tale that he was reading he felt
like a spectator awaiting the climax to
a particularly dramatic scene in a melo-
drama
  there came a lull in the wind and the
mice suddenly ceased to scamper as if
at a signal from a master mouse the
old house appeared to be waiting in sus-
pense-holding its breath grimstead
had reached the point in his story where
the sounfi of muffled blows from the
vault was reverberating through the ill-
fated house of usher
  madman he read i tell you-
  he looked up quickly the dying
down of the wind and the cessation of
the scamperings in the wainscoting made
the room feel as dead as stagnant water
looks but it was not the nerve-racking
stillness that had galvanized grimstead
into alert attention it was the unalter-
able conviction that someone or some-
thing was lurking near him reaching
stealthily for the automatic he glanced
keenly around the room certainly he
was the only living soul there but-
  the door of the dressing-room was
slowly opening
ii
  grimstead stared incredulously at the
widening aperture he had thoroughly
inspected the toom less than half an
hour before and no living creature
could have been concealed there nor
was there any other doorto the room
the thing was impossible-yet it was
happening before his eyes
  wider wider the door opened and
then as grimstead held his breath in
suspense something stepped into the
room he could not see it but he felt
it and an icy wind suddenly stirred the

fingers from the grave
roots of his hair at the realization that
he was no longer alone he heard the
ghostly sound of footsteps crossing the
room and then the candle on the dresser
suddenly wavered as if a passing breeze
had slightly stirred it as the para-
lyzed newspaperman gazed wide-eyed
from his chair there came from the
dresser the unmistakable sound of hair-
pins tinkling down into a celluloid tray
  thinking that an over-vivid imagina-
tion was playing him tricks grimstead
by a tremendous effort of will sat erect
in his chair and was about to spring to
his feet when an amazing thing stupe-
fied him once more into inaction
  the ghostly footsteps crossed the car-
pet once more like the soft brushing of
unseen wings and grimstead saw the
bed suddenly sag-as if a body were
lying there-and then one of the pillows
became indented-as if a head were
resting there
  something inzisible was reclining
upon the bed
  as this incredible fact percolated
through grimsteads understanding
blind panic assailed him only one
thing he confessed afterward pre-
vented him from becoming a gibbering
idiot that was his discovery that the
door leading into the dressing-room
which was wide open after his visitant
had entered was now tightly closed
this tended to convince him that the
entire episode was an hallucination due
to overwrought nerves
  at any rate he sprang to his feet de-
termined to probe the mystery to its
depths when a sound smote upon his
ears that stiffened him in his tracks and
made him snatch the automatic hur-
riedly from the table
  someone was coming up the stairs
  he heard the sound of shuffling re-
luctant footsteps as if the person thing
or whatever it was were disinclined to
make the ascent slower and more hesi-
tant became these ominous footsteps
and grimstead now utterly unnerved
gripped the automatic frantically and
turned a white face in the direction of
the bedroom door not knowing what to
expect but he felt convinced that if
this door opened as the other had done
and no tangible thing entered he should
scream like an hysterical woman
  the unwilling footsteps had now
reached the landing outside the door and
came to a halt there as if the intruder
were listening this wait seemed inter-
minable to the crouching newspaperman
who stood immovably by the table his
automatic aimed straight at the door
finally there was a shuffle of feet and
then a hand turned the knob slowly
the door opened
  hands up cried grimstead hoarse-
ly or ill shoot
  what the devil growled a sur-
prised voice and grimstead emitted a
great sigh of relief at least it was a
human being
  a heavily built bearded man about
fifty years old a stranger to grimstead
walked slowly into the room first glan-
cing around fearfully before allowing
his gaze to rest upon grimstead
  now then he said coldly who are
you and what are you doing in this
house 
  just what i was going to ask you
grinned grimstead his self-possession
now fully restored
  i am- began the stranger-and
then came the crowning horror of that
memorable evening the mans voice
suddenly broke and his tanned face
turned livid with fear he was star-
ing with a look of indescribable terror
at the bed
  whats that whos there he
whispered in high-pitched terror-laden
accents
 why-what- stammered grim-
stead and then froze into the gaping
figure of a man
  the indentations in the bed and pil-
fingers from the grave

low slowly straightened out like a flat
automobile tire when the air rushes
in
   once more grimstead heard those
 ghostly footsteps and then the
 bearded man shrieked like a demon in
 hell
   selma for gods sake dont he
  gasped i didnt mean to do it i
 swear i didnt mean to do it
   he staggered back fumbling at his
 throat and gasping for breath
   take your hands away he panted
 my god you are throttling me
   his voice died out in a choking gurgle
 and he staggered wildly around the
 room pulling desperately at his throat
 as if trying to unloosen the clutch of
 hands grimstead took hold of the
 struggling figure
   you are mad he cried there is
 no one here
   the stranger did not seem to hear
   his eyes were rolling in his head and
 his face was turning a mottled purple
 up and down the room he threshed in
 agony trying vainly to break the deadly
 hold that was apparently fastened upon
 his windpipe with the grip of a mad-
 dened bulldog it was a horrible sight
 and grimstead could do nothing but fol-
 low the agonized man who seemed des-
 titute of all reason
   the end came quickly suddenly
 there was a rattling sound in the mans
 throat and then he sank slowly to his
 knees and toppled forward on his face
 once more the sound of invisible foot-
 steps and grimstead looked up from the
 dead body in time to see the door of
 the dressing-room open quickly and
 close
   then he lost all control over his
 twitching nerves and ran shrieking out
 of the room down the stairs and out
 into the fresh sweetness of the septem-
 ber night staggering like a drunken
 man his brain reeling from the horrors
 of that fetid bedroom
ill
  the sight of the familiar street and
the feel of the wind blowing in his face
partially restored his faculties to nor-
mal but he was trembling like a drug
fiend as he entered dr stoughtons office
and his speech was so incoherent that
the amazed physician was convinced that
he was either intoxicated or insane but
as the spell of the horror wore away and
grimstead began to talk more ration-
ally dr stoughton realized that this
was no ordinary case and that grimstead
was neither intoxicated nor insane he
was that most pathetic of all objects-
a strong man suffering from overwhelm-
ing fright
  dr stoughton had been the carey
physician and was for many years wel-
don careys closest friend so it was
with a very grave face that he went back
to the house with grimstead accompa-
nied by mort farley an official who
facetiously called himself sedleys
chief of police
  it was with a strong shudder that
grimstead entered the house that had
shattered his skepticism to bits and fol-
lowed the two men upstairs every-
thing in the bedroom was just as he
had left it his candles were still burn-
ing and his automatic lay whereit had
fallen from his nerveless hand in the
center of the room was a huddled heap
that had once been a man
  hm this looks bad ejaculated
dr stoughton as he bent above
the prostrate figure he turned the
body over and the face peered up at
him distorted and black as a charred
log
  my god its weldon carey he
shouted drawing back from the corpse
in sudden horror
  how do you know asked farley
in awestruck tones it has been
twenty years-and this man wears a
beard

fingers from the grave
  dr stoughton lifted the mans limp
left hand
  i can tell by this amethyst ring on
the little finger he explained it was
given to him by his mother and he has
always worn it on that finger as it was
too small to fit on any of the others
  what do you think caused his death
doctor asked grimstead
  it was a sudden rush of blood to
his head said dr stoughton caused
by a tremendous shock of some sort
then after a pause it couldnt have
been anything else there are no marks
on his throat and he looked challeng-
ingly at the newspaperman
  i only know what i know replied
grimstead and he told the whole story
again for farleys benefit not omitting
the slightest detail when he had fin-
ished the police official looked doubt-
fully at dr stoughton this sort of a
case was outside of his own ken
   frankly i am puzzled over all this
began the physician looking more close-
ly at the face of the dead man it is
very evident that- hello he broke
off abruptly this is devilish queer
i must say
  taking a small magnifying glass
from his bag he bent over the body and
examined the throat carefully
   this is the most extraordinary tiling
that has ever come within my medical
knowledge he said gravely
  what is it asked his companion
curiously
  when i first looked at carey ex-
plained the physician there were no
marks whatever upon his throat it
was strangely white in contrast with his
blackened face but now look
  he handed the glass to grimstead
the newspaperman looked started and
then looked again without a word he
handed the glass to farley who looked
through it long and hard then he
whistled softly 
  finger prints he said laconically
exactly agreed dr stoughton
they have come out on the skin like a
rash careys throat looked like an un-
developed negative when i first looked
at it but now through some queer 
phenomenon it has been developed 
  a little silence followed his words
  did you perhaps notice anything
else when you looked through the
glass continued dr stoughton
  what for instance asked grim-
stead
  those finger prints on his throat
were those of a woman said dr
stoughton they are much too small
to have been inflicted by a man
  good lord said farley
  but they couldnt have been inflicted
by a woman  observed grimstead sa-
tirically because you said my story
was an hallucination beings that fig-
ure in hallucinations cannot commit real
murders can they
  humph grunted dr stoughton
then with a puzzled frown what
do you think of all this grimstead
there is only one way to think re-
plied the newspaperman carey un-
doubtedly murdered his wife and came
back to visit the scene of his crime as
murderers from time immemorial have
done his wifes ghost was in this
room i am as certain of that as i am
that my name is grimstead it was
selma careys fingers that reached from
the grave and strangled her husband
  bosh ejaculated the physician
such things are impossible
  grimstead shrugged his shoulders
nothing is impossible nowadays
doctor he said

the deviltry of dr waugh
                  by christopher b booth
i
the leaky radiator of a flivver
was responsible for the discov-
ery judson wheaton a farmer
living in the lower end of the
county was driving to the city when he
shut off his overheated engine and
climbed down into the dusty roadway
some distance from the highway stood
the thatcher farmhouse bleak ugly
and deserted its pitiful shabbiness
charitably hidden by the thick foilage of
many maple trees
  wheaton cursed again that people
should build their houses so far from
the thoroughfare
  now ive got to tramp all th way
up that hill for water he lamented
a stranger in the neighborhood he did
not know that the place was deserted
until he reached the top of the knoll
and saw the windows staring vacantly
down upon him
  just my luck he mourned prob-
ably not a bucket on the place
  the hapless driver made his way
along the weed-choked path around the
side of the building suddenly rooted
in his tracks by horror he let forth a
yell of surprised terror
  underneath one of the large trees
was the body of a man face turned to
the sky the eyes bulged wide and the
muscles of the face were frozen into an
expression of wild and livid fright
  a few feet from the body stood a
smart limousine an automobile of ex-
pensive make on the doors were the
neatly stenciled initials k a w
wheaton raced down the hill stood
in the centre of the roadway as he
    b m-sept-
flapped his long arms up and down in
a frantic signal to the motorist who was
at that moment approaching from the
north
  dead man up at that house he
shrieked dead man-think hes mur-
dered 
  brake bands protesting dr john
lake a young practicing physician of
a nearby suburb brought his car to a
grinding halt
 dead man you say up at the
thatcher place thats strange its
been deserted for two or three years
he eyed wheaton with appraising
eye there were a number of road-
houses along the highway which took no
cognizance of the federal statute framed
by a certain mr volstead the man was
not intoxicated
  im a doctor he added ill go up
and see if he is dead
  wheaton shivered
  oh hes dead all right i aint a
doctor but-i saw his face i think he
was-murdered
  you dont live hereabouts do you
queried dr lake well i would ad-
vise you to stick around until the cor-
oner is called it may save you another
trip lets go up and look things over
i-ive seen enough thank you
said wheaton but nevertheless he
plodded up the hill at dr lakes heels
  as the two men reached the open
spot in the trees lakes eyes widened
in surprise as he caught sight of the
luxurious limousine
  phew i he whistled this is some-
what out of the ordinary i thought it
was just a common tramp


the deviltry of dr waugh
  he hurried his steps as he reached
the body the doctors head jerked for-
ward in astonishment
  great heavens he whispered in
amazed awe doctor waugh 
  in the medical world the name of dr
kensaw arlington waugh was one to
conjure with a specialist of renown
he had lectured at the medical school
from which doctor lake had been
graduated and although he did not
know him except as a student would
be expected to know a class instructor
it made death more of a personal matter
and for a moment shattered his pro-
fessional calm he had always had a
great admiration for the somewhat ec-
centric specialist
  what a horrible death shuddered
dr lake i never saw such an ex-
pression on a human face
  mastering his emotions he became
at once his professional self with deft
fingers he searched for signs of vio-
lence to his perplexity there was no
wound  laceration not a single
mark even the clothing bore no evi-
dence of a violent struggle
  he decided that some instantaneous
poison must have been used probably
cyanide which while it acts so quickly
that the victims life is snapped like a
tight-drawn thread seizes the body in
one quick horrible convulsion and
leaves the muscles as of stone but he
failed to find the tell-tale rigidity of
tissues which he had expected
  not cyanide that is certain he said
in abstracted monologue confounded
queer business eh wheaton
 farmer weaton stood some feet
away back turned it was apparent
that he had no morbid liking for grue-
some things
  dr lake bent forward his attention
attracted by a faint abrasion on dr
waughs neck a place less than two
inches long under the chin and slightly
below the ear where the skin had been
rubbed nearly raw by some rough sur-
face shaking his head in frank be-
wilderment he walked over to farmer
wheaton
  wheaton he said sternly why
did you tell me that this man was mur-
dered
  startled by the accusing suspicious
note in the young doctors voice the
farmer flushed
  because he said angrily a man
with an expression like that on his
face never died a natural death why
-you dont mean to tell me that he
wasnt murdered
  theres not a single mark of vio-
lence mr wheaton
  mebbe not doctor but his face
 it looks  it looks- his
voice dropped to a sepulchral whisper
   like he had been scared to
death
  nonsense snapped dr lake im-
patiently men arent scared to death
-outside of book covers
  youre a doctor sir i guess you
know admitted the farmer humbly
  dr lake absently creased his leather
automobile gauntlets
  something devilish mysterious
about this he said what could dr
waugh be doing out here at an old
deserted farmhouse a first-rate mys-
tery i call it i tell you what you do
theres a farm a quarter of a mile or
so down the road you go down there
and telephone to coroner hopkins ill
look around a bit and wait for him i
feel quite an interest in this dr waugh
was one of my instructors at medical
college i might be able to help a bit
the coroner is a feeble old man with a
brain about as palsied as his hands
im afraid that if we depend on him
the law will be a long time in getting
this thing solved
  as farmer wheaton made his way
back to the road again dr lake began
a survey of the premises
the deviltry of dr waugh

  he mounted the rotting porch steps
the boards creaking under his weight
the branches of the trees moved by a
breeze rustled against the weather-
boarding of the old house
  a fine cheerful place at night ill
bet he muttered somehow this be-
gins to get on my nerves
  the door which led into the tiny re-
ception hall was ajar from this old-
fashioned entrance were three doors
leading into as many rooms as he
opened the sagging door to the right
dr lake paused in startled bewilder-
ment wondering if his imagination was
playing him a trick
  the wall between two rooms had
been ripped out making of them one
long apartment the debris chunks of
plastering and scraps of lath still lit-
tered the floor
  across the length of the enlongated
room had been laid what seemed a
miniature railway track pea-haps half
the width of a standard gauge railroad
the light steel rails were bolted to
heavy pieces of lumber which served as
cross-ties
  resting on the rails were two cars
about seven feet in height apparently
constructed of steel from where he
stood in the doorway dr lake could
see the facing end of one of the cars
from it protruded hundreds of sharp
points almost needle-like in their sharp-
ness
  now wouldnt this stump you ex-
claimed the doctor ill say that is a
queer business-damned queer
  in a confusion of uncertainty he ad-
vanced cautiously the steel cars stood
perhaps five feet apart as he stepped
nearer another gasp of surprise escaped
his lips the end of one of the cars
hidden from view until this moment
was caved in the gaping hole exposed
a crude framework of light lumber
  just a toy mused dr lake pa-
pier mache or i miss my guess-just
cardboard painted to look like steel
he examined the sharp steel points
they bent back harmlessly at the touch
of his finger-also merely cardboard
  closer examination showed geared to
the rear wheels of both cars a toy
motor such as might have delighted
the heart of a child at christmas time
the electric current for the motors was
supplied by two wires which ran along
the floor and connected with the track
the wires led to the wall and contact
was completed by means of a massive
switch which might easily have carried
a high-voltage current instead of
the weak stream of electricity which
was generated by the dozen dry-cell
batteries hidden in an adjoining
closet
  dr lake threw in the switch the tiny
motors hummed slowly and the mys-
terious cars edged forward edged is
the proper word for the motion was
barely perceptible the cars made a
speed of only one foot per minute
  huh uttiest outfit i ever saw
lake mused dr waugh dead as a
hammer and this-this damned foolish-
ness-i wonder what the answer is
as he slowly paced the floor hands
deep in his pockets and his face creased
by thoughtful lines he was suddenly
aware of a further detail fastened
from the ceiling was an iron ring and
from the ring dangled a short length
of rope the end frayed as if parted
under heavy strain fastened to the
floor in direct line with that in the
ceiling was another steel ring
the young doctor started suddenly
by jove he gasped somebody
was tied in the middle of that track-
feet to the floor rope from his neck
to the ceiling
  he remembered the faint abrasion
under dr waughs chin a rope could
have made that mark
  great god the fiends shouted
dr lake his voice echoing through

the deviltry of dr waugh
 the empty rooms they tied poor old
 dr waugh to this track and-
   he shuddered at the picture which
 his mind swiftly drew-the picture of a
 man ignorant of the make believe
 harmlessness bound helpless as those
 cars creeped upon him
   the floor was thick with accumu-
 lated dust and the dirt film was broken
 by footprints blurred in the spot about
 the steel ring in the floor as if some-
 one had nervously scraped his feet back
 and forth the young doctors heart
 leaped with hope as he saw also the
 clear-cut impression of a mans hand
 spread flat fingers and thumb extended
   heres where i turn detective
 mused lake remembering the camera
 in his car ill try my hand at a bit
 of photography ive a notion that the
 hand fingerprints and all will photo-
 graph very well
   at that moment a bit of sunshine
 breaking through an open space be-
 tween the maple trees streamed into
 the room lighting the shadows under
 the strange make-believe cars and glint-
 ing against a bit of yellow metal that
 lay there dr lake reached for it and
 found it to be a stickpin of rather fan-
 tastic design something european with-
 out a doubt-the gold fashioned into a
 claw which grasped a blood ruby
   now breathed lake with satisfac-
 tion if im going to turn detective
 i	think ive got something to work
 on
   lake had just finished taking his pho-
 tograph of the fingerprints-and a
 glance at dr waughs slim tapering
 fingers was sufficient to tell him that
 the impression in the dust was not that
 of the dead mans hand-when coroner
 hopkins a bearded old patriarch who
 had held his office for many years ar-
  rived peering nearsightedly through a
 pair of thick-lensed glasses and shaking
 his head hopelessly
   oh yes he greeted dr lake
youre the young doctor from ala-
mont they tell me that doctor-doc-
tor waugh is-is dead terrible busi-
ness-cant understand it-what would
dr waugh be doing out here answer
me that terrible business-cant un-
derstand it and-what the devil is
this contraption
  his eyes for the first time caught
sight of the cars the young doctor ex-
plained what he had found
  i am told that you have already ex-
amined doctor-the body pursued the
aged coroner what do you find
dr lake told him
  humph mourned the coroner
sadly queer business i knew dr
waugh by reputation-a wonderful
specialist he was great loss to the
medical profession-cant understand
it
  what do you propose to do ven-
tured dr lake
  coroner hopkins shook his head
im not so young as i used to be
young man i generally name an as-
sistant to perform an autopsy
  but protested dr lake wont
you proceed with some sort of an in-
vestigation 
  im not a detective young man im
the coroner i shall perform the au-
topsy turn my findings over to the
states attorney and examine what wit-
nesses can be found so far mr-er
-wheaton who found the body is the
only witness
  dr lake frowned impatiently
  but mr coroner he insisted
theres a mystery here to be cleared
up we are outside of the city where ex-
pert detective talent is available of
course the reporters for the city news-
papers will take a hand at sherlocking
but really something should be done
what would you suggest de-
manded the coroner dryly
  dr lake accepted the invitation
eagerly
the deviltry of dr waugh

  if you would deputize me i would
be glad to serve he replied dr
waugh was one of my instructors at
medical school and i feel a very deep
personal interest in this case i should
like to see no stone unturned-
 youre deputized my young
friend cut in coroner hopkins be
sworn
ii
  dr john lake jeopardized his slim
but growing practice by abruptly de-
serting his patients and plunging head-
long into the dr waugh mystery he
rushed to the city to delve into the in-
cidents which had preceded the spe-
cialists death nor was he alone a
small army of reporters was encoun-
tered at every turn he bumped into
feature writers at every step the city
editors had gone frantic over the dr
waugh mystery they printed columns
upon columns of entertaining descrip-
tion and fruitless deductions they
plastered their pages with photographs
of the thatcher farmhouse and the
mysterious steel cars
  the real estate agent who had the
renting of the thatcher farm in charge
was able to throw no light on the mys-
tery he had rented the place by
phone he had received a money order
for a years rent sent in the name of
julius smith the lessee had never
showed up to sign the papers the
julius smiths listed in the directory
furnished ample proof that it must be
some other julius smith
  the autopsy verified dr lakes first
examination there had been no vio-
lence done no poison administered
there was no clot on the brain no heart
lesion
  it remained for dr lake armed
with the stickpin which he had found
at the thatcher farmhouse to find the
only real clue and for reasons of his
own this clue never got to the news-
papers
  dr waugh had no family he lived
alone in a house on belden avenue at-
tended by a servant named samuels a
reticent and rather wooden-headed and
non-observing man of near sixty
  the body of dr waugh had been
discovered on thursday morning
samuels related for the benefit of dr
lake and reporters alike that on tues-
day dr waugh had brought home a
young man of very shabby and dis-
reputable appearance the young man
had worn a bandage about his eyes and
dr waugh had explained to samuels
that he was a patient suffering from
temporary blindness this was un-
usual for dr waugh seldom treated
charity patients and never at his
home
  samuels due to the bandage about
the young mans face could not supply
any sort of an adequate description
about all that he was able to say was
that he believed the mans hair had
been brown and that his chin was black
with an untidy stubble of beard
 on wednesday afternoon dr
waugh had dispatched samuels to the
bank with a check for five thousand
dollars this amount in cash
samuels had brought home and turned
it over to the doctor no trace of the
money was found it had vanished
utterly
  still later on thursday samuels was
dispatched on another errand when
he departed dr waugh and his blind
patient were in the house when he re-
turned both were gone the specialists
chauffeur furnished another link in the
far from complete chain
  dr waugh seldom drove his own
car but at the time he left his belden
avenue home for the last time he had
summoned his car from the nearby
public garage where it was kept dis-
missed the chauffeur saying that he

the deviltry of dr waugh
preferred to do his own driving that
afternoon
 when dr lake and samuels were
alone the young doctor produced the
stickpin which he had found in the
thatcher farmhouse
  samuels he said did this belong
to dr waugh
  no sir said samuels promptly
but ive seen it before
 where
  well sir i aint much hand to no-
tice things but i did notice that pin
the blind young man that the doctor
brought home with him was in a ter-
rible condition sir his shoes were very
badly broken and his clothing hung to
him only in shreds his linen was ac-
tually black sir he actually looked the
tramp-a bum yet i noticed that he
wore that stickpin perhaps the reason
i noticed it was that i could tell by the
glance at it that it was a bit valuable
and i wondered why he didnt pawn it
and get himself a clean shirt and a pair
of shoes
  dr lake grinned triumphantly
 my hunch wins he exulted
something told me the minute i found
this pin that it was going to be a clue
by the way samuels dont say any-
thing to the newspaper men about this
stickpin i want to work this out in
my own way-if i can
  very well sir agreed samuels
obediently
  after a time the city editors began to
lose interest in the dr waugh case
the city detective bureau which had
tried to render some little assistance
soon found troubles of their own more
pressing yet once and sometimes
twice a week there appeared in the
want-ads columns of the newspapers
under the lost and found classifi-
cation this advertisement
 found-gold stickpin animals claw hold-
ing a stone will be returned to owner for
cost of this advertisement
  the advertisement brought no re-
sponse
  after several weeks had passed dr
lake called upon coroner hopkins
  mr coroner he explained ive
still got this stickpin that i found out
at the thatcher farmhouse and i want
your permission to keep it a while
longer i want to wear it in my neck-
tie just as long as you will allow me to
keep it
  coroner hopkins stared at the young
doctor in perplexity
  i fail to grasp just what you mean
he retorted if you are asking me to
give you property which-
  no i dont want the stickpin mr
coroner but it belonged to the man
who knows how dr waugh died he
wore that pin when he was ragged and
perhaps hungry i want to wear that
pin three hundred and sixty-five days
in the year and ten years if need be and
give its owner the chance to see it in
my tie if the law of averages breaks
my way and if hes still in the city hes
going to see it-and the man who
thought enough of that pin to wear
rags rather than pawn it will make
some effort to get it back
  oh i see snorted the coroner not
without a sneer i see you are still
playing detective well you are a per-
sistent young fool but it occurs to me
that youd better be spending a little
more time with your medical practice
  then i may keep the pin for a while
longer asked dr lake eagerly
  id forgotten you had it grunted
the coroner by thunder doc i do
admire persistency
  
  dr waughs death occurred in june
it was the following september when
dr lake his automobile in the repair
shop with a cracked crank case was
forced to make a trip to the city via
trolley his business took him to the
north side and he boarded a crowded
the deviltry of dr waugh

surface car at the interurban station
he did not observe that a well-dressed
young man-apparently young despite
the snow-white streaks through his
hair-who had been going in the
opposite direction wheeled suddenly
about and swung aboard just as the
car got into motion
  passengers were packed on the rear
platform like proverbial sardines and
it might have easily been accidental that
the young man lurched against john
lake just as the latter fished a hand-
ful of small coins from his pocket to
pay his fare the money fell in a
shower to the floor and lake glanced
back in anger
  i beg your pardon sir murmured
the young man in polite accents as he
stooped to aid in collecting the spill
  my fault he added mighty
sorry matter of fact though its a
shame the way they pack the cars-
seven cent fare too
  lake growled agreement on this
point
  fine weather isnt it pursued the
young man-he was perhaps in his
middle thirties-in the trite manner of
the man who wished to drum up a con-
versation lake ordinarily a friendly
soul was not in a conversational mood
he was on the point of turning his back
coldly when he saw that the strangers
eyes were feasting hungrily on the stick-
pin  his heart skipped a beat
  yes he agreed fine weather in-
deed live here
  the stranger nodded
  i was just noticing that pin in your
tie he broke out eagerly reminds
me of one i saw once in europe-be-
longed to a friend of mine odd isnt
it
  yes lake laconically agreed i
presume that it is a trifle unusual sev-
eral people have commented on it i
got it in a rather odd way too
  the other man waited
  yes bought it from a fellow who
was down and out-got it rather cheap
but since ive had it ive become quite
fond of it
  oh said the other in evident dis-
appointment you wouldnt care to
part with it then 
  probably not for what its worth
w-what do you consider it-
worth asked the white-haired young
man
  i hadnt thought of pricing it did
you want to buy it
  well frankly yes you see i dont
care much for jewelry but when i saw
that pin-er-its counterpart in eu-
rope-i fell quite in love with it i might
be willing to pay your price name it
i dont believe id care to part with
it for less than five hundred-and thats
more than its worth probably twice
over
  ill take it replied the stranger
with a contented sigh if youll get
off the car with me well go to the bank
and get the money
  very well agreed dr lake what
bank
  the liberty national
  at the next block dr lake and his
companion left the car and lake sud-
denly remembering that he must tele-
phone that he would be late for an ap-
pointment hurried into a telephone
booth at a corner drug store he called
the detective bureau and hastily ex-
plained matters
  when dr lake and justin graham
as the young man had introduced him-
self reached the liberty national two
plainclothes men met them at the en-
trance at a signal from lake they
seized grahams arms
  you are under arrest one of them
announced with proper official solem-
nity
  young grahams eyes widened and
an unmistakable pallor crept into his
cheeks

the deviltry of dr waugh
under arrest he echoed what
for
for the murder of dr kensaw ar-
lington waugh declared john lake
  graham took a grip on himself he
glanced at the stickpin in the doctors
tie and smiled
  i see he said smiling wryly
youre rather clever well suppose
we go to the station and talk it over
ill tell you about it-but it wasnt
murder
ill
  in the office of the chief of detec-
tives sat the chief dr lake and justin
graham the prisoner was perhaps
the coolest of the three for both the
chief and lake were excitedly eager-
especially lake
  im glad to get it off my mind glad
to get it all cleared up graham began
without urging id better begin right
at the beginning and tell you the whole
thing id be a fool to deny knowledge
of the affair for i read the newspaper
accounts and i know that someone
found and photographed my finger-
prints i suppose you still have them
it would be only silly for me to make a
denial for that would indicate that i
have something to fear i havent
he paused and turned to dr lake
  i remember you now from the pic-
tures that appeared in the papers at the
time not very good pictures either
you are the doctor who first examined
dr waughs body you found no evi-
dence of foul play did you
  youre the man whos being ques-
tioned not i reminded lake curtly
  yes thats true agreed graham
with a short laugh but you didnt
you found no wound no laceration no
evidence of a blow being struck no
poison no diseased organism-nothing
but failure of the heart to function
isnt that true
  go ahead with your story growled
lake
  i will pursued graham but i
just wanted to remind you in the be-
ginning that you are accusing me of
murder when you have no evidence
that a murder was committed
  we have evidence that something
queer happened out at the thatcher
farm said john lake with spirit
  yes thats true and im going to
clear that up for you its a mighty
queer business as you say well here
goes ill make it as much to the point
as possible
  on the sixth of june i was broke
and hungry-starving i could starve
but i couldnt beg my life was a
failure i was in debt it began when i
wandered out to lincoln park i was
walking along the lagoon and as i came
to a bridge a couple passed me they
were talking about the bridge
   thats suicide bridge and
theyre going to tear it down next
month more than fifty people have
jumped from it since it was built during
the chicago worlds fair
  until that moment i had not thought
of suicide but the idea took hold of me
and try as i would i could not shake
it off i tried to walk away from sui-
cide bridge but the power of sugges-
tion was too strong a park police-
man came along dont do it buddy
he said i pretended that i didnt know
what he meant and he went on when
he disappeared i began to climb the
steps to the bridge a voice behind me
stopped me
  i turned around and there was a
well-dressed man of about sixty with
a close-cropped vandyke beard hurry-
ing toward me-
  dr waugh interjected lake
exactly agreed graham i wait-
ed for him to come up
   why are you going to kill your-
self he asked me
the deviltry of dr waugh

   none of your damn business i
told him
   come with me he said you need
a square meal
  i went along with him after the
meal as we sat in a quiet corner of the
rather cheap restaurant he made me his
proposition as near as i can remem-
ber it he said
   life means nothing to you for you
were about to kill yourself i want to
make a bargain with you i want to
engage in- a sort of an adventure it
may cost you your life it may not-
youll have to take that chance if you
live through it you will be five thousand
dollars the richer if it costs you your
life the five thousand will be disposed
of as you see fit thats my propo-
sition  i shall tell you no more take
it or leave it
  i thought it over he was right
life meant nothing to me he was offer-
ing me the chance to at least quit the
world with a clean slate-it would
square up my debts and a little besides
i accepted his proposition
  he telephoned for his automobile
and while we waited took me into the
washroom of the restaurant where he
bandaged my eyes
   ill have to blindfold you he ex-
plained  its part of the agreement
when we got into the car we drove
for a short time and stopped we went
up some steps it was the house where
he lived i heard him tell a servant
whose name was samuels that i was
blind and that he was going to treat me
i might as well have been blind for
there wasnt a ray of light through those
bandages
  almost at once he had me undress
and put me through a physical exami-
nation especially testing my heart
   sound as an ox i heard him say
after he used the stethoscope perfect
heart thats fine
  i spent the night at the house and
the next day he sent to the bank for
the five thousand dollars an hour or
so after that he gave me some decent
clothes-some of his i think they were
for we were of about the same build-
and led me out to his automobile he
drove himself and i sat on the front
seat with him we went downtown
and he allowed me to remove the ban-
dages from my eyes then i went into
a bank-alone-and deposited the five
thousand dollars with instructions as
to where to send it if i did not call for
it within a week i got back into the
car with him and he seemed much re-
lieved
   i was afraid youd try to give me
the slip after you had the money he
said that hadnt occurred to me i
had too much curiosity anyway-i had
to see it through
  after we left the downtown dis-
tricts he wrapped the bandages on again
and we drove for a long time i could
tell by the atmosphere that it was night-
fall we had left the boulevards and
were jolting over rough country roads
at last we stopped and he led me
through high grass and weeds my feet
got all tangled up in them
  he took me into a house and i knew
by the musty smell that no one had
lived there for some time and i knew
by the hollow way that our footsteps
echoed through the place that it was
unfurnished we had not walked very
far when i stumbled over something
which barked my shin before i knew
what happened a rope dropped over my
neck and was drawn tight instinctive-
ly i clawed at the thing which was cut-
ting into the flesh of my neck but he
seized my arms and although i strug-
gled he succeeded in tying them be-
hind me of course that made me
helpless i couldnt offer much re-
sistance when he grabbed my legs and
tied my ankles-tied my feet to the
floor

the deviltry of dr waugh
  i hadnt bargained for anything like
this and to be frank i was very much
afraid-afraid of an unknown some-
thing that i could not see i imagine
that i screamed in my fright but he
only laughed at me
   shout all you want he said no
one can hear you
  then he took off the bandages the
room was in semi-darkness lighted only
by two flickering candles and for a
moment i could not make things out
clearly you know what i saw-those
railroad cars looming up in the gloom
and the candlelight shining on those
points which stuck out from the end
of each car i was tied standing up-
right in the middle of the track i
couldnt move for the rope about my
neck kept me in one position
   great god  i shouted what are
you going to do to me 
   i am going to kill you he said
oh come my young friend you were
willing enough to die yesterday i am
cheating you of nothing you will get
the five thousand dollars-and death
   perhaps you realize what will hap-
pen he went on those steel cars will
move toward you at the rate of one foot
per minute in fifteen minutes those
steel points will prick your flesh and
then-they will slowly slowly-ha i
see you undersand-
  he was right i did understand i
wont burden you gentlemen with the
horrors of it i wont try to tell you
the torment that was mine-i couldnt
and i dont like to think of it i-
sometimes i dream of it now its hell
  i begged him to shoot me-anything
i knew that he was a madman-some
impossible creature in real life stepped
right out from a page of poe as i
begged for mercy he snapped on the
electric switch and i could see those
cars vibrate a little they seemed to leap
toward me
  he left the room without a word
leaving me there with that devilish
death trap as ingenious a thing of tor-
ture as the pit and the pendulum
  it could not have been long but it
seemed like hours at last those cars
were close enough that had my arms
been free i could have reached out and
touched them i began to pray and as
i prayed i strained at my bonds until
the rope cut into my wrists and into the
flesh of my neck i was slowly chok-
ing myself to death and just as i was
losing consciousness i had the sensa-
tion of falling suddenly the breath
rushed back into my bursting lungs and
the blackness before my eyes cleared
i had indeed fallen the rope from
the ceiling must have been very rotten
for it had parted under the strain the
weight of my body had smashed in one
of those fiendish make-believe cars
  something pricked my wrists it was
a nail and i patiently worked away
severing strand after strand until my
numbed arms were free it was then
but the matter of a moment to loosen
the knots which bound my anldes
  there isnt much more to tell gen-
tlemen i-
  but dr waugh- eagerly broke in
john lake how did he-
  young graham smiled shrewdly
  oh yes im getting to that doctor
when i slipped out of the house dr
waugh was sitting in his limousine
calmly smoking and-reading in a
sudden burst of anger i made up my
mind to kill him
  ah breathed the chief of detec-
tives so you admit-
  that i killed him indeed no
chief denied justin graham i-
er-changed my mind
  the door of the limousine was open
and i slipped across the grass and had
seized him before he knew it even as
my fingers were about his throat i re-
alized that he must be an irresponsible
lunatic and that there could be no jus-
the deviltry of dr waugh

tice in slaying him i decided to truss
him up drive him to the city and turn
him over to the authorities that a test
might be made of his sanity
  he begged me not to kill him and-
then he told me
   he told me that he was a physician
he said that he had always taken the
position that a normal sound man could
literally be scared to death he told
me that other physicians differed with
him arguing that so-called death from
fright could occur only when there
was a weak heart
  the desire to prove his contention
became an obsession with dr waugh
and he decided to prove it he rented
this farm and set up his play railroad
and began to search for a subject he
was hunting in fact when he stopped
me from jumping from suicide bridge
he justified himself on the ground that
i would have ended my life anyhow and
that i had lost nothing
  when i realized that dr waugh
was not after all an irresponsible
maniac my anger returned that a
physician whose life should be dedi-
cated to the relief of human suffering
should subject any man-regardless of
how lightly he valued life-to the in-
human mental torture that i had en-
dured all for the sake of proving a
silly unimportant medical theory
  i had pinned dr waugh to the
ground there was a rope in his tool
box qifickly i passed one end of it
about his neck and fastened it to a tree
the other end i tied to his feet and to
the rear axle of the automobile
  great god  cried john lake you
were going to-
  justin graham did not answer
  i got into the car he continued
i put my foot on the electric starter
button the engine roared and then-i
shut off the engine but-
  doctor lake jumped to his feet
  but dr waugh was dead he
finished the sentence you killed him 
you murdered him-in cold blood you
-you scared him to death
  graham met the accusing gaze
calmly
  i think that most doctors will con-
tend that a man-a man with a normal
heart-cannot be frightened to death
he said quietly
  doctor lake eyed the prisoner in-
tently
  youre a medic yourself he ac-
cused
  do you think so smiled graham
  do i think so thundered john
lake i know so naturally i have
read between the lines of your story-
just as you intended that i should oh
youre a clever fiend you gave dr
waugh the same chance that he gave
you you tested his heart as he lay there
on the ground-probably you used his
own stethoscope you got into the au-
tomobile started the motor with the
deliberate intention of-of letting dr
waugh prove his own theory it was
deliberatv murder
  i hardly think you can prove that
in-in court suggested graham
  i know damned well i cant shout-
ed lake you as cold-blooded a slayer
as a man who ever fired a pistol are
safe from the law so far as the law
is concerned the waugh case is closed
-he died from heart failure heres
your stickpin get out
  the chief of detectiyes was nodding
his agreement with lakes position the
chief was eyeing graham curiously
  hum he rumbled mr graham
has your-er-hair been white long
  since-since that night justin
graham replied
  the door closed
  do you know lake i dont blame
graham-much muttered the chief
  john lake stared out of the window
  well chief he said perhaps i
dont either-much
  the cave i shouted pressing the knife into her hand and pointing to a nearby
  cavity-page

i
that last night in marquesan
waters as cleaves and i sat on
the fore-deck of the anchored
jezbel listening to the talk of
leaping fire the polynesian midship-
man the bay of traitors was lit with an
eerie glow along taha-uka from the
rockbound shore where the surf hurled
its futile rage upon a bastile of dun-
colored stone to the somnolent lights of
hivaoa dreaming beneath the black
thunders of temetiu legions of phos-
phorus battled in green strife
   yonder is the isle of taoha
menikes leaping fire was saying
pointing with his tattooed arm toward
what seemed a mass of stone rising upon
the moonlit night his speech punctuated
by the creaking of the boom as it swung
with the lide and heave of the lazy
rollers in the days before the chris-
tian god came when po the power of
darkness ruled the islands the sea-
robbers of tahati used to hide their
treasures there-somewhere near the
high place and the vale where dead
men walk
  the vale where dead men walk
i echoed what is that
  a valley below the high place
from the sacrificial altar of po the
old chiefs used to hurl their victims into
the gorge-in the days when the island
was called bloody taoha 
  once a polynesian always a polyne-
sian and in the south sea islander there
still lurks desire for the taste of
human flesh and i imagined that as he
spoke leaping fire could again hear
not without joy the savage throbbing
of rawhide drums in the dank purple
valleys of bloody taoha
  is the island still inhabited tltis
from cleaves
  yes years ago there were more
than a thousand warriors on taoha but
with the white man came plagues and
wars-until now there are less than fifty
mahuma is the chief but he is slowly
drinking himself to death with kava
ah menikes the history of taoha the
dying island is written in blood-and
the future    but who knows the fu-
ture
  id like to visit the island observed
cleaves
  do not go to taoha warned leap-
ing fire it is accursed all die upon
taoha and some say- he paused
  what i urged
  some say that the spirits of the ta-
hatian pirates return from under the
earth to guard their treasures 
  cleaves and i gazed seaward to the
isle of tragic history a bulk of stone
that bared its nakedness to the low-hung
tropic stars
  lay you two to one i can beat you
swimming to the island rundel spoke
up cleaves
  i smiled take you up
  it is two miles away protested
leaping fire and in the bay are
tnako and fekc-fierce man-devouring
sharks and devil-fish
  but we would not listen to him the
tales of hidden loot and crimson deeds
had stirred our blood
  im for the swim sharks or no
sharks said i without bravado for i


daughter of the pigeon
did not realize the danger and as
long as ive been in the tropics i have
run across only one devil-fish ill tell
you cleaves well see who can reach
the high place first you taking one end
of the island and i the other equalizing
the distance what do you say
  you do not know the way to- be-
gan the polynesian
  perhaps interposed cleaves but
you will tell us moreover you and a
couple of the crew will follow in a
whale-boat and wait on the beach to
bring us back the race will be to the
high place and back to the whale-boat
the first one reaching the high place
piling several stones on the altar to let
the other know hes been there
  that was how it began down in the
tropics men do queer things the savage
song of the surf on the coral reefs is a
tune of lawlessness
  twenty minutes later cleaves and i
stripped but for bathing trunks were
descending the gangway-stairs while
leaping fire and others of the crew
lowered a whale-boat
  i warned you menikes leaping
fire called to us sadly from the deck
  and i laughed-for his tales of
piracy and the feel of the amorous wind
on my body had aroused the sleeping
boy withhi me
  ready asked cleaves- and i
nodded
  side by side we plunged into the
green bay the water was mildly cool-
old wine to the muscles when i re-
turned to the surface i struck out
toward the island which seemed a mass
of dark-ridden rocks beneath the fiery
southern cross several yards away
the phosphorus leaping about him
was cleaves headed for the northern
end of taoha
  that swim whipped the blood into
every fiber and sinew of the being
thinking little of sharks or devil-fish i
crossed the ruffled bay of traitors and
within an hour a bit sore of thews-i
confess i touched the sand on the south-
ern end of the island
  rarely have i seen such tropical
beauty as on taoha-cool white sands
strewn with sea-weed and curious shells
forests of mangoes cocoanut-palms and
bread-fruit towering basalt rocks
honeycombed with caves and seeming
riven with bronze as countless cascades
and waterfalls caught the tarnished ar-
gent of the moon
  following the polynesians instruc-
tions i walked several rods down the
beach and found the nearly obliterated
trail that he had described a path lead-
ing into a dark hollow
  across valleys and ridges i sprinted
in the shadow of dripping rocks where
the atmosphere was saturated with mois-
ture beneath eis-plants and the crim-
son-flowered hutu-tree not infrequently
passing ruined paepaes meager evi-
dence of the gradual death of the little
island
  after a trot of about a mile i gained
the summit of a hill where red jasmine
and orchids bloomed in profusion and
halted breathless looking upon what i
knew to be the mist-laden vale where
dead men walk
  here the stars seemed to hang lower
so low that the smell of them was in the
atmosphere across the earth depres-
sion stone ledges rose from the deep-
sunken valley and the moonlight struck
the bare rocks transforming them from
dead matter into living sheets of light
  the vale where dead men walk
well named for a vague something
made me aware of its presence in the air
by an imaginary nevertheless ponder-
ous weight upon the lungs  as if the
souls of the perished sea-robbers surged
back upon the valley
  as i slowly descended the ridge-
slowly because of a strange reluctance
to hurry-i had the uncanny feeling of
one invading the dominion of the dead
daughter of the pigeon

even the rank odors of the flowers sug-
gested death
  the ascent of the ledges was not with-
out difficulty footholds were treacher-
ous and more than once the roots of
vines yielded to my weight leaving me
swinging at dizzy heights but after ten
minutes of breathless climbing i
dragged my full six feet over the edge
of the high altar and stood upright
beside the altar of po
  evidently cleaves had not arrived
the decaying altar was bare 
  the high place of taoha crowned
a gorge-a wound that gaped in the
stomach of the earth like the heel-mark
of a giant conqueror at the bottom of
a sheer drop of ten feet a narrow ledge
clung to the stone walls winding down
into the orchid and fein-grown canon
where the monster boulders threw their
shadows across the rushing stream on
the side of the gorge opposite where i
stood a cave leered blackly from the
rocks and not far away was the la-
goon flanked with palm-fronds a con-
necting link between river and sea a
mild roar insinuated itself upon the air
-the combined booming of the gorge
stream and the not distant surf
  the savage lawless splendor exerted
over me an awesome spell and my imagi-
nation ever eager to slip its leash
painted sinister figures in the gorge
ghostly shapes that materialized in the
maw of the black cave
  of a sudden the blood began to throb
through my head-for no conjuring of
the fancy had created those forms they
were real moving as phantoms upon the
background of creepers that sprawled
over the walls
  i dropped flat on my stomach the
touch of my skin upon the moist cold
stone sending a quick thrill trickling
along my sensory nerves
  the figures five in number all lithe
of body with the exception of one
crawled stealthily out of the gorge and
when they attained the top of the oppo-
site side were swallowed by the bread-
fruit and cocoanut-palms
  i continued to stare at the trees where
they vanished men-islanders from the
color of their naked skins-coming from
the cave it was rather intriguing even
insidious and i immediately determined
to penetrate the cave whose jaws had
spewn them
  as i swung down from the high
place dropping on the narrow ledge
i regretted my hasty action the wiser
plan would have been to wait for
cleaves but i had started without him
and being young which is to say stub-
born too i decided to finish it alone
  more than once during that perilous
descent into the gorge did i wish i had
abandoned my purpose on the narrow
trail below the high place
  at length a bit bruised and smarting
from contact with the rocks i found
myself before the cave its mouth
breathed damp foul odors-the smell
of fish and stale salt a gradual incline
went down into its throat vanishing in
somber darkness
  i felt a queer dread of the place as i
entered and before i had advanced many
yards this aversion increased to terror
in the dank foul air was an element
that inspired in me a sensation similar
to the one i had experienced as i
crossed the vale where dead men walk
-the ponderous weight upon the chest
  i wondered if by chance i was ex-
ploring a hiding place of the old taha-
tian pirates and if in this gullet of
darkness i would stumble upon chests
of loot-green with the rust and mould
of ages these thoughts fanciful
though they were lured me on drew me
as in response to a magnet deeper into
the bowels of the earth
  i could hear a distant booming-like
the surf upon the rocks other than
that and a drip-drip-drip of water
somewhere in the unseen cavity it

daughter of the pigeon
ached with the stillness of a sepulchre
  after fully three minutes of groping
forward my outstretched hands came in-
to contact with a fungi-grown wall and
as i turned to the left my fingers slip-
ping over the damp surface i saw a
broad strip of aniemic light streaking the
darkness it was very singular such an
illumination apparently born of itself
in the cavern and i stood motionless
trying to discover its source
  it was a noise that moved me-a
groan-such as i once heard from the
throat of a wounded devil-fish-a sound
thrice hideous in the darksome cave
had i coughed the following moment
my heart would have lain upon the floor
  from the vague light the groan had
come causing me to take an involuntary
step-and not in the direction of the
streak of illumination i wanted to
bolt it but instead i forced myself to
wait for a repetition of the noise and
when a moment had passed in silence
emboldened by the hush i moved to-
ward the strange glow
  as i reached it i almost laughed in
the ceiling of the cave was a gap of
great depth and breadth which admitted
the moonlight thus creating the singu-
lar and startling pillar of light stars
were visible too-no longer low-hung
but seeming at distances illimitable
  i had almost forgotten the terrible
groan in my discovery when it was re-
peated weaker nevertheless stirring
the hair on my scalp
  my eyes swept the shadows that
hugged the pillar of light and now
somewhat accustomed to the gloom i
could make out many square shapes be-
yond the glow-objects that i perceived
to be nothing less than sea-chests
  the sight of them quickened my pulse
iron-bound sea-chests rusty locks
doubloons   
  i	could not reach the nearest chest
quick enough and as my fingers found
the lock they trembled violently to
my surprise the lid yielded-but not
without a shrill of protest from the an-
cient hinges
  empty
  i moved to the next one following
the shriek of the unoiled iron sheer
horror drove its rapier the length of my
body i drew back terrified yet fasci-
nated
  in the huge sea-chest face upturned
was a man
ii
  i cannot adequately define my emo-
tions i was filled with a craven desire
to run to shut the lid upon the body to
do anything to escape the horrid cavern
how long i stood there stiff with fright
i do not know but it was some time and
the third groan aroused me from the
fear-stupor
  he was alive i told myself-prob-
ably injured   
  i forced myself to grip the figure and
drag it from the sea-chest into the pallid
moonlight
  it was a slim marquesan youth naked
but for a pareu an ugly blade driven
hard into his stomach the sight of the
wound sickened me his eyes were open
and upon me-large pathetic eyes with
him life was a matter of minutes a
surge of pity for the young body swept
me the death of youth is always a
grim affair-a dark portal closing upon
sublime vistas
  to my surprise he smiled-a rather
ghastly expression
  menike he whispered something
dark upon his lips you you help me
   i-
  go on i urged as his voice trailed
off and although i knew he was be-
yond the aid of man i added i will
help you
  again the ghastly smile tahaiupe-
hii-daughter of the pigeon-she-
  well i finally got the story a tale of
daughter of the pigeon

tears and flowers such as one would
expect to hear on this dying island
told between gasps for breath
  his name was red moon on taoha
was a maiden whom he desired for his
wife-tahaiupehii daughter of the
pigeon pale of throat and dark of eyes
she was the child of mahuma the chief
habuhamo a chieftain of fatu-hiva
also coveted the fair tahaiupehii-and
habuhamo was fat and degenerate and
daughter of the pigeon despised him
for she in turn loved red moon
  on this evening red moon had re-
ceived a message to come to the cave
of the laughing lepers and as he en-
tered he was attacked by habuhamo and
his men    stabbed before they put
him in the sea-chest the obese habu-
hamo told him that it was his intention
to go to the paepae of mahuma the
drinker of kava and steal the moon-
throated daughter of the pigeon-after
he had killed her father   
   in the end he asked if i the menike
would follow habuhamo and his men
to the paepae of mahuma and save ta-
haiupehii he was dying he whispered
and if i did not go   
  as he finished his story he did a
plucky thing-he withdrew the knife
with a feeble wrench from his stomach
his tawny face convulsed with agony
   you take knife he muttered hand-
ing the bloody weapon to me you
carry red moon on    back-and red
moon show you paepae of mahuma  
i did not believe the boy would last
three minutes but i lifted him as gently
as i could and slung him on my back
   when i reached the high place af-
ter a tortuous ascent from the gorge
with red moon clinging to my neck i
was disappointed i had hoped that by
good fortune i would meet my friend
here but instead of cleaves i found a
pile of stones upon the altar of po
  that journey from the cave of the
laughing lepers to the house of ma-
     b m-sept-
huma is burned into my memory after
what seemed deathless aeons of plung-
ing through jungles a light glimmered
among the trees when red moon saw
it he begged to be left here saying he
was an encumbrance now
   save her menike he pleaded pite-
ously as i placed him on the round death
seeping into the liquid black eyes tell
her that 
  but i never knew what to tell her
from his lips came a sound like the flut-
ter of beating wings   
   i left him there resolved to return
later and bury him and with the bloody
knife that he had given me i crept into
the clearing around the thatched bam-
boo house lights shone from the door
and one window
  climbing upon the paepae i crawled
to the lighted window it opened out
from a small cool room with green
mats and bamboo walls the five mar-
quesans were there wearing crimson
pareus and necklaces of sharks-teeth
all slim but one whom i knew to be
habuhamo he was clad in a scarlet
and yellow kahu-ropa his big nose
ringed with an ornament fat and greasy
in the light of the whale-oil lamp with
red piglike eyes-a thing to loathe in-
stantly
   the chief was speaking so swiftly in
marquesan that i with only my smat-
tering of the tongue could not thor-
oughly understand him and before i
comprehended the full import of his
words the four warriors filed out of the
bamboo dwelling i hardly had the
opportunity to drop in the shadows be-
fore they emerged
   i lay still not daring to move or hard-
- ly breathe until i heard their padded
footsteps growing fainter then i became
bold enough to raise my eyes-just in
time to see the last of the four vanish
in the gloom of a path that deserted the
clearing for the jungle
   once more i peered within the house
	daughter of
  habuhamo was seated turk-fashion
on the green mats his back to the door-
way i smiled with anticipation for i
hated him not with the antagonism that
is often the result of clashing personal-
ities but with a deep loathing as for
some crawling thing of the earth
  gripping the blood-soiled knife i
moved to the door and crept stealthily
inside halting a few feet behind habu-
hamo at that instant some psychic
current conveyed to him the fact that he
was not alone he glanced over his
shoulder and i looked straight into the
narrow piglike eyes
  the sound that issued from between
his moist lips was like nothing human
he tried to make his feet but i was
upon him one armencircling his thick
neck the blade poised above his heart
  i ought to kill you instantly habu-
hamo i said in my bastard marquesan
but there is something i want to know
before-
  no no dont kill he whimpered in
poor english i spik english-
  where is mahuma-and tahaiupe-
hii i demanded
  habuhamos red-shot eyes moved to
a dark doorway on the left and i invol-
untarily loosened the grasp about his
throat-and as i did he wrenched free
staggering to his feet with the scream of
an angry boar i scarcely had time to
balance myself for the onslaught before
the soft body was hurled upon me and
his arms pressed me to his breast i
caught the reek of rum-and habu-
hamo   
  i struck with doubled fist instead of
the knife-the left fist it went home
in the solar plexus carrying my whole
weight behind it a foul blow i admit
and with that inhuman cry the island
chief pitched forward like a sodden piece
of driftwood upon the green mats
  i stood above him breathing hard and
trying to clear my nostrils of the odor of
him he did not move i turned his
the pigeon
bulk over with my bare foot and the
feel of it sickened me
  that solar plexus blow had done him
to unconsciousness habuhamo was out
of it for at least fifteen minutes   
  i moved into the adjoining room
dark-but not so dark that i could not
see the body on the floor instinct told
me it was mahuma the wound was a
nasty one-such as had been dealt red
moon mahuma seemed so old so help-
less as he lay there in his own blood
  and daughter of the pigeon-what
of her
  the dwelling boasted of three rooms
and tahaiupehii was in none
  as i quitted the room where habu-
hamo lay upon the green mats emerg-
ing upon the paepae my eyes alighted
upon the jungle trail which the islan-
ders had taken it was the only course
left to pursue and i plunged between the
whispering foliage
  i knew the path led seaward for i
could hear the breakers and the pound-
ing of the surf in the blow-holes but i
was not prepared for what i saw the
jungle dropped away before a ledge
whose quartz-like surface scintillated in
the moonlight several yards beyond the
brush a narrow stream flung its torrents
over spray-dashed rocks tumbling
headlong into a huge bowl of solid
granite fully nineteen feet below and
here still foaming furiously from the
fall it swirled between stone banks to-
ward the sea at the juncture where
the river met rough water lofty cliffs
overhung the beach pierced with innu-
merable caves
  i found jnyself on the very verge of
the cataract before i knew it below
on a flat rock at one side of the pool
was a form slim and pale as a flame the
slender shoulders lost in masses of dark
hair daughter of the pigeon i knew-
for as she stood poised on the brink of
the huge granite bowl she was as fair
as that winged creature after which she
i
daughter of the pigeon

was named i could see that she wore a
pareu twisted about her
  not two yards behind her an islander
was squirming over the spray-wet stone
following him was another on the
opposite side of the pool the other mar-
quesans were crouched behind boulders
  unaware of her danger tahaiupehii
stood on the edge of the rock but even
as i looked her straight body flashed
through the air plunging into the
foam
  as she vanished beneath the water one
of the islanders crawled to the rim of
the pool an instant later her head
appeared and she must have seen him
for a cry rang above the dull boom of
the waterfall
  the marquesan slipped into the pool
  i experienced a moment of indecision
my brain strove to function quickly
the two figures were almost side by side
in the current nineteen feet-a
straight drop and i did not know the
depth yet   
  i gripped the blade between my teeth
took a deep breath after that i was
conscious of shooting through space   
down    into what seemed a depthless
pit i struck the pool-went under with
a force that lashed my flesh and expelled
the air from my lungs
  in the battle against the torrent i al-
most lost the knife but in some manner
i managed to retain it through a
whirling opaque mass i came up every
inch of my body stinging
  not more than a rod away i saw the
two figures i caught the gleam of
grappling arms-saw a face that in the
night was pale like blue moonlight as
exquisitely beautiful as any i have ever
seen   
  in a moment i reached them closing
about the shining dark neck with the
other hand i swung the knife together
we sank in that gray chaos we strug-
gled i slashing with the deadly blade
  of a sudden it was conveyed to my
brain along with a strangling sensation
that my hand was holding nothing-
that the knife-thrusts had told i
buoyed myself upward and attained the
surface-alone i doubt if the native
ever came up
  it must have been a rock that sent me
out at any rate the pain was sharp-
in the back of the skull things went
dim i realized that a hand gripped my
hair-then i knew    nothing
ill
  the sleep that followed was not calm
-nor can i hardly call it sleep for dur-
ing the whole period i had a peculiar
awareness of things of movement and a
sound like unleashed thunder and
with the advent of full consciousness i
was not as i expected in the water al-
though it was damp and i could feel a
cool spray upon my body
  i sat upright on cold stone my head
aching dreadfully something close at
hand was roaring and in a hazy way i
realized that the noise was responsible
for the spray but as my vision cleared
i saw only dimness broken on one side
by a glimmering sheet that was a shade
lighter than the surrounding gloom
  gradually i comprehended i was
under the waterfall in a dark recess in
the rocks the shifting curtain was noth-
ing less than the cascading water
  then i was startled by a voice almost
at my elbow speaking in marquesan-
menike you are awake-at last
  i knew her instantly though she was
little more than a blot in the dimness
tahaiupehii-that exquisite young crea-
ture whose face i had seen momentarily
as i fought the islander
  i am glad you have come back
menike she said creeping closer to me
and slipping her small spray-wet hand
in mine her nearness made me con-
scious of a pleasant odor-that of red

daughter of the pigeon
jasmine your head hit a rock-and 
i was afraid 
  you saved me tahaiupehii i
asked
  i saw you as you dived from above
-knew that you had done it to save
me from habuhamos men after you
were hurt i swam with you to this cave
under the waterfall
  i looked about me a grim loath-
some place i imagined there were
creeping things upon the rock floor but
it was sanctuary
  you were very brave i commend-
ed wondering how i was going to ac-
quaint her with the truth
  my vision was becoming better regu-
lated now and with the aid of the pale
light that filtered through the liquid
curtain i could see her tawny face
daughter of the pigeon-less than
seventeen i knew a symphony of the
worlds sorrow a living symbol of that
tragic isle to which she belonged
  how did you happen here men-
ike she questioned white men
rarely come to taoha any more  
  so i told her then-told her of my
swim to the island and the discovery of
red moon in the sea-chest in the cave
of the laughing lepers told her of
the death of her boy-lover near the
paepae of mahuma and the finding of
her fathers body in the bamboo
room
  man is ever crude in the presence
of bereavement and my words must
have been dagger-thrusts she wept
 of course father and lover in a
night and as she sat there drenched
with spray clad only in the dripping
fareu a tragically lovely figure she re-
called to me a field of lilies that i had
once seen    just before the dawn
when the dew was upon their chaste
petals
  be calm o tahaiupehii i en-
joined gently endeavoring to invest my
sympathy in the words you are still
in danger tell me is anyone else
aware of this cave
  i do not know menike
  if it is unknown to habuhamos
men they will think us drowned-but
if it is known-they will come after us
-or wait 
  her small hand was still in mine and
i felt her shudder
  ah i cannot stay here-in this
darkness-thinking of red moon and
my father we must dive under the
waterfall and swim for the sea
  i doubted the wisdom of such action
and expressed my opinion to which
she replied we cannot discover if
habuhamos men are waiting by re-
maining here-and if they know of the
cave and come after us-then the
chances for escape will be less
  i thought of cleaves and the men-
probably searching the island for me
and said my friends are somewhere
on taoha-and if we can make the sea
-in the event habuhamos men are
waiting-
  only for your safety do i care
she broke in you exposed yourself
to danger for me but i- all that i ever
cared for is gone let another page
of the history of this doomed island be
written-in my blood-for rather than
submit to habuhamo i would kill my-
self
  i felt a bit hysterical i wanted to
laugh such odds three islanders
probably searching the island for mg
girl and me it might have been rare
sport had she not been there but her
presence gave the situation a horrid
twist
  come menike i heard her say
let us go this place stifles me-
  it burned me to think of habuhamo
alive i wished that i had used the
knife upon his corrupt body   
  very well tahaiupehii i agreed
after a moment swim under water
as far as you can-and stay ahead of
daughter of the pigeon

me ill attend to habuhamos men
  i saw her smile-a fixed lifeless ex-
pression 
  my heart went cold within me as we
swung down from the dripping rocks
of the cavern as the deluge showered
her slim body i caught a glimpse of her
face paler than the whitest moons
  that plunge was a horror to me
bruised and breathless my vision
flecked with fire i sank    down   
into a reeling watery world my feet
touched bottom before i was able to
begin the fight upward and when at
last i gained the surface i dashed the
spray from my eyes
  tahaiupehii was a yard or more
ahead of me arms agleam in the moon-
light they were there the three islan-
ders sleek and sinister slipping down
from the bank of granite basin there
was a fourth too a fat sprawling
form high on the rocks
  habuhamo   
  again i wished i had killed him in
the bamboo hut
  the islanders were between tahai-
upehii and me and habuhamo was
running along the shore parallel to the
girl
  straight after the marquesans i
swam until i was abreast of the rear
one he was a wiry fellow smaller
than i with an ugly blade gripped in
his teeth i struck him between the
eyes and literally tore the knife from
his mouth as he sank i saw some-
thing black upon his lips
  after that objects swam in a blurr-
blended water and rocks and over all
the tranquil moon instead of launch-
ing an offensive against the other two
natives i succeeded in gaining a lead
on them and side by side tahaiupehii
and i were borne with the churning riv-
er occasionally i glanced behind at
the pursuing islanders and that obese
effigy on the bank
with the deadliness of sharks the
marquesans followed-down with the
boom and thunder of the stream into
the mouth of the sea here the con-
flicting currents caught us in their tur-
bulence and lashed us toward the giant
rocks that fringed the shore
  a new peril loomed in the shape of
the crags where the surf gave vent to
its wrath and we swam with all the
strength we could assemble against the
menace tahaiupehii was the first to
reach the shore i saw blood on her
shoulder where the sea had flung her
cruelly upon a jutting stone in her at-
tempt to crawl from the surf
  i was not far behind her and as i
staggered out of the thrashing water
the bulky figure of habuhamo ap-
peared from behind the rocks of the
river bank trapped i threw the girl
a look of futility it was the finish
unless   
  the cave i shouted pressing the
knife into her hand and pointing to a
nearby cavity in the rugged cliffs de-
fend yourself until i come-
  i caught the gleam of her pallid face
as she obeyed
  habuhamo must come first i told
myself-but fate decided otherwise
upon glancing back i perceived that
one of the marquesans had reached the
shore and was clambering upon the
rocks with a slim blade in his hand
  i looked about for some means of
defense and my eyes dropped to the
broken bits of boulders that lay at my
feet i bent and gripped one lifted
it above my head and let it fly it
struck him on the forehead with an
ugly sound-like a crushed cocoanut
shell   
  throwing a glance toward the cave i
saw tahaiupehii entering habuhamo
at her heels as i started to follow a
lean something from behind closed
about my ankle-the hand of the last
marquesan a terrible-looking fellow
naked and tattooed to a kings delight

daughter of the pigeon
  with a bound he was upon me and
i let go my fist sending him rolling
among the rocks regaining my feet
i reached his side and bent over him
how i accomplished the following feat
i do not know-but i grasped him by
the nape of the neck and one limb and
lifted him clawing above me staggered
to the edge of the surf and hurled him
head-first into the shallow water
  as the weight left my hands i fell
back on the rocks but was up instantly
-for the picture of tahaiupehii as she
darted into the cave followed by that
obese chief was written in crimson on
my brain
  shortly i reached the mouth of the
cave a huge gap in the cliffs only par-
tially roofed and under almost two feet
of water from the rear came a muf-
fled roar
  splashing through water above my
knees often stumbling in the dimness
i covered what seemed miles plunging
with every step further into the cave
at an abrupt turn i was brought into
an outlet that ran between lofty walls
the light of the yellow moon intruded
upon the gloom faintly revealing the
sucking snarling tide that rolled over
the rocks and eddied between the cliffs
  they were there-tahaiupehii and
habuhamo locked together on the sur-
face of a boulder as i rounded the
corner i saw her thrust him away and
down upon him something glistening
held over her heart
  i shrieked-but the gnashi g of the
surf devoured my voice
  habuhamo sprang-and at his first
movement tahaiupehii plunged the
shining thing into her breast   
  i closed my eyes i think i reeled too
so sick with horror was i when i re-
gained the mastery of myself i dashed
through the water which was now just
below my armpits and drew myself
upon the boulder where habuhamo
stood
  i struck him from behind knocked
him flat upon the stone and threw my-
self upon him pinning him beneath my
weight and sending my doubled fist
time after time into the bloated horrid
face
  my reason surrendered wholly to a
frightful lust to murder blind to all
except the bloodshot eyes beneath me
eyes that were glazed with horror that
beseeched mercy i thrashed him tore
at his skin with my finger-nails choked
him beat his face until its grotesque
mutilation forced a hysterical laugh
from my throat my own madness
nauseated me yet not once did i falter
or weaken in the ghastly business-not
until the body was lifeless and with
my bruised bloody hands i pushed it
to the edge of the boulder and kicked
it into the delirious water the last
glimpse i had of that sodden rum-
soaked flesh called habuhamo was as
the surf flung its foaming arms about
it and dragged it out to sea
iv
  tahaiupehii was conscious when i
knelt beside her on the edge-slim and
white as fire her wet dark hair spread
in a tangle about her lovely face more
than ever her features seemed fash-
ioned from blue moonlight
  tahaiupehii tahaiupehii i cried
trying to make myself heard above the
surf i will take you out to my yacht
-and you will get well-
  daughter of the pigeon smiled not
at me or what i said but because i
believe she heard another voice ringing
clear above the tumult of the sea-the
voice of her boy-lover in the darkness
of po
  she did not stir again only lay there
lips locked the childish smile frozen on
her face   
  i carried her down to the beach and
placed her gently on the white sands
daughter of the pigeon

i shall never forget her as she lay there
her exquisite body dashed with the salt
spray of the sea the wound between
her breasts as dark as a tropical gar-
denia
  a half hour later cleaves and leap-
ing fire came upon us on the beach
they were about to abandon the search
for me believing me gone to the
sharks after i told them the story we
carried tahaiupehii to the paepae of
her father and here not far from the
bamboo house that had known her
love and sorrow we buried her   
between mahuma and red moon
  several hours afterward i was on
the deck of the jczbel and while a sul-
len red-shot dawn flared above the
thunders of temetiu the yacht
throbbed out of the bay of traitors
  the last sight that i had of taoha the
dying isle was through the morning
fog a haze that lay upon it like a spirit
hand    as if the volcano that in
ages past had spewn it above the green
pacific was reaching up from fathom-
less depths to reclaim it

the heart on the mantel
                 by paul everman
when i first saw it move i
became sceptical as to the
worth of my vision a dead
mans heart cut from his
body sealed in a glass jar of alcohol-
why should it move how could it move
  this heart was by far the most hor-
rible thing in leon campeaus collec-
tion of human debris as his room-
mate and fellow student in medicine i
had tolerated the clutter of bones and
skulls he had picked up also the im-
maculate skeleton which leered gro-
tesquely at me from its tall glass-doored
case but to me this heart this lump of
muscle and tissue seemed hardly ap-
propriate as a companionable ornament
  leon had brought it in that very
morning delighted in its acquisition for
it was on the heart that he was special-
izing he had secured it he explained
with the connivance of a keeper of the
morgue he had bribed this keeper he
told me to allow him to remove the
heart from the body of a derelict who
was to be buried that morning in the
potters field a clever fellow leon
  the heart was now where he had
placed it-in its jar on the mantel-a
reddish-brown lump that seemed but a
deep shadow against the vestal white-
ness of wall that rose behind and above
  with one elbow propped on my lit-
tered study table i watched the thing
nervously had it really moved or was
my imagination flighty
  there it moved again-i was sure
yes it moved an almost imperceptible
flutter in its liquid preservative i
stared it jerked again    again
   the jerks were weak clumsy
measured

  the thing was coming to life it was
beating
  i shuddered and glanced quickly be-
hind me all about the room but i was
alone-alone except for a dead mans
heart
  leon was away on one of his nightly
amours and frangois bourlin a fellow
student who was specializing in diseases
of the lungs my own major had spent
the earlier part of the night with me
we had little of the brilliance of leon
who at a glance could grasp the mean-
ing of an entire page and retain it who
could hear more with a stethescope than
we could see with our eyes whose skill
with the knife had aroused admiration
from the greatest surgeons of the fac-
ulty no we were grubs we worked
for what knowledge we got but when
we got it we did not boast of it as leon
boasted of his accomplishments
  francois had left at nine-thirty and
it was after ten when i noticed the first
movement from the heart
  its beats were now growing stronger
i could see the alcohol ripple in tiny
waves with each rhythmic beat i
listened-and heard a gentle splash
splash splash as regular yet not so
metallic as the ticking of a watch
  suddenly the heart flopped convul-
sively and drifted with the gentlest
movement to the top of the jar it was
beating steadily now it circled slowly
about the jar like an exhausted bird not
sure of its direction
  its impossible i muttered to my-
self it cant be its my nerves my
mind ive worked too hard i must
be careful
  by a supreme effort i forced my eyes
the heart on the mantel

from the devilish thing i rummaged
wildly in my desk till i found my
syringe my bottle of morphine i drew
up my sleeve and among the many al-
most indistinguishable pits in my arm i
pricked another
  calm came instantaneously i laughed
at my fruitful imagination
  it was my nerves i thought i
will tell no one
  and with freshened courage i
turned and gave a bold stare at the jar
on the mantel the heart had stopped
beating was lying silent inert in its
diaphanous grave
  when leon came hurrying in a half-
hour later i was getting ready for bed
his sallow carelessly-wrought features
were splashed with the high color that is
raised by much wine and aroused ardor
  henri he cried throwing aside his
hat and ulster it has been a wonderful
night you should have had a girl and
been with me man ami
  i was surfeited on this kind of talk
every night but i hid my shrug and
asked
  and where was it-the wonderful
time 
  at the cafe noir sacre fanchette
is delightful a wonderful companion
but you know her mon henri
  yes i knew her-fanchette-a mis-
chievous imp of femininity i had been
with leon to the cafe noir a modest
tavern owned and managed by fan-
chettes husband m leblanc a jolly
little fellow so amorous-hearted and so
trustful of fanchette that before his
very eyes she had carried on a flirtation
with leon she was infatuated with
him-that i could see and here of late
he had become infatuated with her
  but i said to leon what of the
little girl back in bayonne-nina the
girl who writes to you each day the
girl you are to marry what of her
have you written to her this week
  he eyed me for a moment of hos-
tility certes i have written to her
  but i knew he lied lying was a habit
with him
  quel diable he burst out angrily
after a moment why do you ask me
that how does it concern you am
i an old owl like you to sit around
poring over books hour after hour
day after day non non i am no
owl i have life i love i enjoy my-
self i am happy-till i see your gloomy
face tiens i provide for you i give
you room i give you clothes yet you
correct me
  i	did not argue with him for i knew
that he was partly right he was rich i
was poor and after all his amours
were none of my business
  frangois came to study with me the
next night for on the day following a
final examination yawned before us
we worked hard nervously and when
frangois finally took his leave my
head was near bursting with thumpy
aches
  but obsequious to duty i bent over
my study table and began to review
some of rolliers pamphlets-wonder-
ful treatises on heliotherapy and arti-
ficial pneumo-thorax outside rain
splashed down heavily as if to crush
my night-blackened window panes the
cry of the storm was the mourning cry
of wretched lonely beasts but i read
on and on till the words of rollier be-
came but dancing specks before my
eyes
  suddenly as if drawn by some sub-
conscious power i raised my head
turned slowly and stared-at the
mantel
  my eyes found the heart in its tall
glass jar its reddish-brown shape
sharply defined against the white back-
ground of wall-
  it zvas beating more stanchly than
on the night before as if it had regained
a lost vitality
  at the top of the jar the alcohol

the heart on the mantel
rocked and lowered in gentle wavelets
with each heart-beat
  i listened-intently fearfully and
above the dull beating of rain and the
whistle and howl of the wind i at last
managed to detect a sound of splashing
in the jar the sound came steadily-
a gentle purring splash splash splash
-with each heart beat with each
wavelet
  i tried to take my eyes away but i
could not i was held by the things
devilish charm as i watched the beats
became thuds the heart gave a clumsy
jerk then floated slowly to the top of
the jar for a moment it swam about
uncertainly from top to bottom from
one side to the other then its move-
ments became rapid agitated violent
it dashed about frenziedly like a fright-
ened bird vainly trying to escape from
its cage the jar rocked with the vio-
lent motion-i heard it i saw
  with a jerky hand i wiped the cold
sweat from my forehead
  my god i thought am i going
mad 
  i tried to take my eyes away-and
failed i must do something with
all the power of will and muscle i could
summon i sent my right hand groping
about the table at last my fingers
found the syringe-and later the magic
bottle of morphine
  somehow i managed the injection
calm came again my eyes dropped
from the gruesome thing    and
when in a spirit of bravado i raised
them again a few moments later it had
stopped its beating and lay motionless
at the bottom of the jar
  i looked at my watch it was 
and fully a half-hour passed before
leon came home
ii
  he came stumbling hilariously into
the study room plainly drunk
  tiens mon henri he cried slap-
ping me on the shoulder it was a
happy night there was wine and my
fanchette and i-ah what happiness
and he babbled on foolishly till he
had led me through the entire course of
his happy night
  while he was talking i was silent but
as he began clumsily to hang up his
clothes i could no longer restrain a
warning comment
  one of these nights when you go to
the cafe noir mon leon m leblanc
will tire of your love-making to his
wife you had better watch out for
him he is a man who loves much and
if he discovers your attentions he will
be dangerous
  m leblanc leon laughed drunk-
enly as he turned to hang up his hat i
do not fear monsieur leblanc he is
like you mon ami he is an owl he sees
nothing besides he is away now he
has gone to the country for a few days
he would buy a farm he would put my
fanchette on a farm pecaire but
while he is gone fanchette and i are
happy she has hired a waitress to take
her place-a lean waitress with brick-
colored hair fanchette acts as man-
ager i am her assistant hah it is
amusing but is it not an ideal ar-
rangement 
  my silence seemed to anger him as
he watched me his leer changed to a
glare and finally he burst out
  but why do you tell me to be care-
ful you have corrected me again
how is it your affair i will mind
my own business and you shall mind
yours    you disgust me  
  but he was in a better humor the
next morning and when i came into
the study room i found him staring
rapturously into the glass jar on the
mantel
  come mon ami he exclaimed and
admire with me the consummate skill
with which i removed this organ ah
the heart on the mantel

was it not an artistic job a wonder-
ful specimen mon henri just what i
need for study i will be a great sur-
geon nest ce pas    yoh should
have specialized in the heart henri
the old lungs that you study are of no
use except for breathing like bellows
such as blacksmiths use but the heart
-ah it is the organ magnifique it is
the heart that sends out blood that is
like the richest of wine it is the heart
that puts the glow to my fanchettes
cheeks it is the heart that gives us
happiness emotion love a wonderful
thing henri-wonderful  
  i failed miserably in my examinations
that day but from the triumphant ex-
pression on leons face when i met
him early in the evening i knew that he
had succeeded as completely as i had
failed the situation was galling to me
i had worked slavishly he had trifled
and loafed yet i had lost and he had
won
  after a hasty dinner at my pension
i hurried to my room as usual leon
was gone partly because of a crush-
ing headache and wracked nerves and
partly because of a desire to be entirely
alone in enduring the days disap-
pointments i went to bed but i did
not sleep-i tossed and rolled i
thought suffered despaired
  finally i got up jerked one of leons
richly-hued robes about me and went
into the study room it was eleven
oclock
  the night was black-a desolation of
disturbing quietude the wind and rain
of the night before had gone not a
whisper not a sound of any kind came
to break the silence of the room-it was
like a void a vacuity of the portentous
stillness
  suddenly yet inexorably i was
gripped by that same subconscious force
that had come to me the night before it
raised my head from my propping
hands it turned me in my chair it
focused my eyes on the tall glass jar
that sat on the mantel
  surely regularly its every motion ac-
centuated against the pure white back-
ground of wall the heart was beating
beating
  a sudden anger rose within me
  i am going mad i thought desper-
ately i would seize the jar and its dev-
ilish contents i would smash it hurl
it from the window but to carry out
my resolution i could not summon the
strength of a single muscle i was help-
less
  as i watched the reddish-brown
lump began to swim about the jar its
beating was measured like a funeral
tramp i could hear it its splashing
sound thudding mightily in the deep
stillness
  suddenly there came a tremendous
splash the heart dived to the bottom
floundered for a moment then again
shot to the top its motion was so
rapid that my eyes could scarcely fol-
low it it churned the liquid it dashed
and darted about madly frantically
it thrashed about in the alcohol like a
wounded shark in the agdny of death
  the thing has a soul i thought
and it is troubled disturbed
  the jar rocked almost overturned
from the violent movement within the
heart veered dodged banged upward
then shot down yes the thing must
have a soul
  i tried to take my eyes away-fruit-
less effort the thing was possessing
me was my master it bade me watch
and i did but as i watched i think i
must have prayed
  i tried to reach for my syringe but
my hand hung motionless at my side
i was powerless
  a quick thought almost calmed me
  i will see now- i told myself-i
will see whether it is my nerves
whether i am going mad i will fight it
without the morphine i will fight it

the heart on the mantel
and if it ceases moving i will have
won
  my situation was no longer terrify-
ing  it became a game a battle i was
fighting playing against the reddish-
brown streak that thrashed continuously
against its background of white i was
fighting its monotonous beats its zig-
zagging progress its splashing sounds
the agitated wavelets it made
  a mellow-toned clock boomed faintly
in the distance i counted its strokes
-one-two-three-
  the heart shot to the middle of the
jar-for a moment became wholly rigid
then its beating slowed i stared
listened yes its beats were timed ex-
actly with each stroke of the clock
they came slowly relentlessly like a
knell i kept on counting
  -eight-nine-ten-eleven-twelve
  at the last stroke the heart again be-
came rigid then it sank slowly to the
bottom of the jar and lay there mo-
tionless
  i have won i told myself fiercely
exultingly i have beaten it it was
my nerves but i have conquered them
  surely a sedative could do no harm
now i thought the crisis had passed
i had shown my strength so i hastily
bared my arm and pricked into it a
double dosage of morphine
  languor came speedily i decided to
not wait for leon so i went to bed
fell into a heavy sleep-and dreamed
  i dreamed about the heart-this red-
dish-brown lump on the mantel i
dreamed that it had eyes that it watched
me i dreamed that it had a soul a soul
that was troubled and that troubled me
i dreamed that it had power invisible
and terrible power that charmed me
cowed me molded me tortured me
  i must have slept solidly throughout
the night i do not remember of awak-
ing a single time all i remember is
that it was a night of hideous dreams
against which i was powerless
  i was awakened by a clatter at the
stairs by a pounding on the door by a
voice crying shrilly queerly
  henri let me in henri let me
in
  i	sprang up into the study room and
opened the door
  francois bourlin stumbled in his
face as chalklike as the white of his
eyes
  henri-havent you heard- he be-
gan in a panicky tremolo
heard i stammered what
about leon ah it is terrible all
on account of that woman-fanchette
   leon has been arrested-has
confessed last night at twelve oclock
the police found leblancs mutilated
body in a sewer in the rue de loix
he had been dead for at least two days
frangois clutched my arm fearfully
and his voice fell to a husky whisper
leon-leon had cut his heart out
  i	recoiled then my eyes flashed to
the jar on the mantel glistening in the
fresh morning light against the white
background of wall was a shriveled
lump inert silent dead and i knew
that it would never beat again
the devil takes a hand
by ward sterling
tennant stopped outside the
door of his wifes room and went
over the details of his plan for
the last time the thing was so
absurdly simple that he wondered why
he had not thought of it months before
there was not the least chance of a fail-
ure he had only to plant the idea in
her diseased brain and she with the cun-
ning that all maniacs possess would do
the rest
  everyone knew her suicidal mania
it had been brought out at the time of
the hearing no blame could possibly
be attached to him for her death had
not the nurse frustrated her in half a
dozen different attempts damn that
fool nurse anyway she had too ex-
alted an idea of the importance of her
positipn
  but after all it was possibly a good
thing that she had been so vigilant
people couldnt say that it was careless-
ness then he smiled to himself as he
recalled the kind things their friends
had said when he refused to send his
wife to an asylum after the court had
pronounced her insane they imagined
that it was his great love that made him
keep her with him it was laughable
how easily people could be fooled how
were they to know that he had made a
careful investigation and found that too
close a watch was kept on the inmates
of such institutions there was a bet-
ter chance of her making a successful
attempt right here at home accidents
are always liable to happen in private
houses in public institutions people are
paid to guard against such things
  curse the fool law that prohibited a
man getting a divorce from an insane
wife such laws made a criminal of a
person otherwise he could have mar-
ried helen a year ago he must guard
against his love for her being found out
it might cause someone to cast sus-
picion his way
  of course they would never be able
to confirm their conjectures but his
position in the community was too high
to have even the finger of scorn pointed
in his direction it would never do for
a deacon in the church and a prominent
professional man to let people know that
lie was guilty of evil even in thought
  no he must keep away from helen
until he had shown the proper amount
of respect for his deceased wife-for he
had begun to think of her as already
dead after a period of hypocritical
mourning they could be quietly mar-
ried-and he would still retain the love
and respect of his fellow townsmen
of course it meant several months
waiting it would be hard-but they
would have the rest of their lives to-
gether-and both of them were young
  and there was the matter of graces
inheritance to be considered too good
thing they had never had a child -it
would be all his now-that is after the
proper formalities had been gone
through naturally he would erect an
expensive headstone to her memory and
give her an elaborate funeral some
people measured a mans love for his
wife by the amount of money he spent
on her funeral
  yes the scheme was simply machia-
vellian in its magnitude and with the
requisite amount of attention paid to
the details there was not the least bit
of danger


the devil takes a hand
  he turned the knob and entered tbe
room with a tender kiss for the wo-
man with lusterless eyes who sat mum-
bling to herself in the low wicker chair
nervously picking at the folds of her
dress he turned to the middle-aged
woman in nurses garb who sat in the
window near by
  better take an hours walk miss
gorman he said kindly you look
fagged out ill look after mrs ten-
nant until you return
  the nurse arose wearily
  its awfully kind of you mr ten-
nant i am tired shes been bad
again today she ended significantly
  tennants face took on a worried
look
  shell probably settle down again in
an hour or so he responded ive a
little work to do-i can do it just as
well in the other room and still keep an
eye on my poor little girl theres noth-
ing around that she can get hold of is
there 
  he settled himself in a chair beside
his wife and patted her white hand af-
fectionately with a tear in her kindly
irish eyes for the little unostentatious
display of love miss gorman left the
room and a minute later tennant from
his place in the window saw her swing-
ing down the street
  the time was at hand
ii
  pressing his wifes hand tightly be-
tween his own tennant addressed her
in the tone one uses in talking to a little
child
  ive often wondered he said quiet-
ly why you didnt commit suicide
grace of course i know that youve
tried it but your methods have been all
wrong do you understand what i am
getting at  i want to help you
  lie looked at the woman keenly he
imagined that her dull eyes took on an
added brightness-that she was not
plucking at the hem of her dress so
nervously he hurried on 
  now im going to show you how
to do it sweetheart then when the
nurse is out of the room some day for
a few minutes you can put one over on
her itll be a good joke on her wont
it come on and ill show you how
to do it
  apathetically she arose and followed
him across the floor to where the big
old-fashioned bed stood in the distant
corner
  now watch me dearie and see
how i do it he continued the
nurse thinks that shes got you
cheated by removing everything that
you might use-but well show her
wont we
  he removed the light counterpane
from the bed and twisted it into a rope
see girlie how its done just the
right size to hang ones self with isnt
it now then we carry this chair
across the room and put it under this
chandelier get the idea
  the demented woman made no an-
swer but tennant knew that her sui-
cidal mind was attracted by the scheme
-that the seed planted in her brain was
already sprouting she followed close
behind him her dull impassive eyes
watching his every move
  he stepped upon the chair and at-
tached the improvised rope to the chan-
delier
  see how easy it is dear he went
on now next we make a noose in
the rope like this-see its just as
easy as rolling off a log then we put
the noose over our head and pull it up
tightly about out neck understand
now all thats left is to kick the chair
out f rom underneath-and the devil and
all couldnt keep a person from choking
to death could he
  from his height atop the chair he
looked down upon the woman
the devil takes a hand
  she was gazing up at him fascinated
her eyes burning brighter now
  the idea pleases you doesnt it
sweetheart he smiled
  she nodded understandingly
  then suddenly she made a leap for
the chair and tore it from beneath his
feet with a frightened yell the man
dropped to the end of the rope his toes
almost-but not quite-touching the
floor
  the maniac stepped back with a
shrill little cry of delight and watched
him gyrate andwhirl as the improvised
rope twisted and untwisted itself his
mouth was open his eyes bulged

from their sockets his tongue stuck
out oddly his breath came gurglingly
sobbingly gaspingly his face grew
black and mottled his legs and arms
danced about curiously twitchingly   
  his peculiar antics filled her with de-
light she forgot her depression in her
new-found happiness he was teaching
her some new game she clapped her
hands together and shouted for more
and when he hung quiet she seized him
by the legs and swung him to and fro
yelling joyously
 and thus the nurse found them-the
living and the dead-an hour later when
she returned from her walk
behind me mrs musgard cowered a heap of jabbering fear upon the floor-

the strange case of nathaniel
broome
                      by charles mcdonell
for the last twenty-five years i
have lived in new york the drab
unadventurous life of a city book-
keeper i have been left pretty
much out of the running but with
money sufficient to pay my unassuming
bachelor expenses i have long ago set-
tled down in my shabbily comfortable
lodgings on fourteenth street
  nothing ever happening to relieve its
monotony i grew to think that life was
to hold little else save humdrum con-
tentment for me during the quiet re-
mainder of my days
  now all this is changed and changed
forever i shall never be the same man
again
  a few months ago there came to take
lodgings in one of the two rooms on my
floor a very strange man
  the evening upon which he moved
into his room my landlady knocked at
my door the way she does occasionally
for a little chat
  evenin mr scrimgeour she said
i suppose you heard him movin in his
things 
  oh your new lodger i replied
well mrs muzzard youve had the
room a long while idle on your
hands
  yes mr scrimgeour but i cant
ezacly say as im overjoyed that its
rented
  why not
  mr scrimgeour i dont like him
  whats the matter withhim
  why there aint nothin the matter
with him as far as that goes its ony
  b m-sept-
that i have a kind of presentiment
thats all hes so-so queer
  that neednt worry you mrs muz-
zard if he pays his rent that is as
long as he doesnt look like a bolshevik
or any other kind of dangerous lunatic
he aint no bolshy and i guess he
aint no loonier than most of the artists
and writers around greenwich village
here and as ive been living down
among them for twenty-odd years i
guess i can stand it no it aint that
mr scrimgeour i cant say ezacly
what it is i think hes one of them
spiritualists we hear so much about
these days in the papers now he asks
me for an oil lamp with a heavy shade
why aint the gas light good enough for
the likes of him id like to know i
never heard of such a queer thing what
can he be wantin a soft light as he
calls it for if it aint so as he can see
the spirits they say them mediums
works in the dark ugh it fair makes
me creep
  well if he raises any objectionable
spirits around here you just let me
know i laughed ill see what can be
done toward exorcising them
  as my interest was aroused in my
fellow lodger by this conversation with
my landlady i lingered about in the hall-
way the following morning in the hope
of catching a glimpse of the stranger
but my curiosity was unrewarded
  every evening during a whole week i
heard him climb the uncarpeted stairs
and enter his room often during the
course of the evening i could hear his


the strange case of nathaniel broome
heavy measured tread as he paced the
floor sometimes late into the night
  one evening as i arrived home slight-
ly later than usual having been detained
at the office upon some special work i
passed him in the dark stairway
  he was coming downstairs and as the
light from the upper hall shone upon
his back and full into my face i was
unable to see what he looked like i
got the impression only of the hugeness
of the man
  tall heavily built his body enveloped
in a large black cloak he appeared in
the exaggerate half-light of the stair-
way to be some great giant hovering
threateningly over me
  he stood courteously aside however
pressing himself against the wall to al-
low me to pass as i did so i glanced
into his face but he wore a very wide-
brimmed quaker-like hat and in the
shadow which it cast i could note lit-
tle save that he wore large black-
rimmed spectacles
  good evening i murmured
  his reply came to me in a deep res-
onant voice soft and almost tender
there was the rich quality in it of the
deep notes of an organ
  a most unaccountable feeling came
over me as i brushed past him some-
thing from the inscrutable alchemy of
an unusual personality i felt like a lit-
tle child that had got lost in an empty
house
ii
  one evening i discovered upon try-
ing to light the gas in my room that i
was without matches seeing a light
shining under the strangers door i ven-
tured to knock and to beg a match of
him
  he answered with a sonorous come
hj which considering the secrecy of
the man filled me with surprise
  i found myself in a meagrely fur-
nished room of nondescript threadbare-
ness akin to my own the apartment
was lighted not with gas as in my room
but by the small table oil-lamp which
had so excited the landladys suspicions
the soft yellow glow repressed by a
heavy shade poured its light over the
table covered as i noticed with a con-
fusion of papers
  you will pardon my intrusion i be-
gan explaining my forgetfulness about
the matches 
  indeed he replied i am glad if i
may put it that way that you have for-
gotten them as it affords me an oppor-
tunity of meeting you other than in the
stairway
  why was it that as he spoke i fan-
cied he must be smiling  something in
the genial raillery of his words i sup-
pose for fthen i looked at him no trace
of amusement could be seen his face
was as calm as unemotional as the plac-
id features of a chinese idol his
cheeks did not crease nor were there
any wrinkles about his eyes
  the impression which he made upon
me now was only one of great good-
nature i wondered why recalling our
first meeting i had been so eerily
moved
  then i looked into his eyes and again
that strange haunted feeling crept over
me as it had done that evening upon
the stairs
  his eyes were so large that i fancied
their unusualness must be caused by the
lenses of his glasses or perhaps by a
trick of the shadows yet there was
something in their expression which i
was unable to fathom could it be
drugs no for there was a look of
grandeur about them they baffled me
we humans who trust so innocently to
our sight we are all so pitifully
blind   
  this was only the first of many eve-
nings spent with nathaniel broome
diffidently almost timidly at first our
the strange case of nathaniel broome

acquaintance then ripened into a quiet
friendship
  what i am most conscious of having
gathered from him is beauty beauty in
the commonplace  beauty in the song of
a sparrow  beauty in the drowsy hum of
the citys impersonal noises
  nathaniel broome changed my out-
look upon life until we together saw
no longer blinded by our eyes
  the low quiet tone of his magnetic
voice lent a magic to his strange un-
usualness his great expressive hands
shaping the gestures of his speech
  when i listened to him talking i
seemed to be swept up enveloped in his
personality i felt as a child must feel
when a playful senior stoops and smoth-
ers it in the skirts of his overcoat i
felt helpless yet cared for i was
strangely happy
  and more than his voice his eyes
always his eyes sometimes a little ter-
rifying to me even now held the secret
fascination of his remarkable character
  that immobile face that calm in-
scrutable buddha behind his huge
hom-rimmed spectacles those great
kindly eyes of his beamed in gentle mer-
riment at some jest or some quaint con-
ceit of his fancy
  he showed me once the portrait of a
young girl-a dark-haired hauntingly
beautiful child
  my daughter he replied to my look
of inquiry putting the photograph back
into the drawer of his writing-table i
knew that he was a widower and for
some reason by his manner perhaps i
supposed that his daughter was dead
too
  naturally i did not press him for
these confidences the subject seemed
to move him so deeply that after he
had once spoken i had never volun-
tarily mentioned it of my own accord
if he told me about himself it was be-
cause he felt the need of companion-
ship the want of a sympathetic ear
ill
  one morning-it was a holiday one
of those rare occasions when one is per-
mitted to enjoy the meagre privilege of
seeing his home surroundings by the
unfamiliar light of day-mrs muzzard
rapped sharply at my door
  mr scrimgeour for heavens sake
come and see what can have happened
to mr broome ive knocked and
knocked at his door but i cant get no
answer
  hes probably asleep still i re-
plied i wouldnt disturb him yet mrs
muzzard
  oh mr scrimgeour i dont think
hes asleep please come and try to
get him to talk to you im    ter-
ribly frightened of him and those creepy
eyes of his you mark my words mr
scrimgeour theres something uncanny
about that terrible man oh why did i
ever let him have me room why did
i ever let him come into me house him
with his strange ways talking to de-
parted sperits all night long
 nonsense mrs muzzard you
mustnt let all this newspaper talk get
the better of your good irish common
sense
  i know what i know mr scrim-
geour him with his wide-brimmed hats
and his shaded lamps skulking around
like an old mole afraid to show his face
in the light o day that man has a
guilty secret she whispered melodra-
matically into my ear
  oh i see i laughed that ex-
plains it nathaniel broome is a mys-
terious bandit-cut-throat-murderer
masquerading incognito
  i dont know what hes in mr
scrimgeour and i dont say hes no
murderer nor nothing all i got to say
and if it was over me dead body id say
it-that mans hiding from the police
i laughed aloud as much at the ab-
surd melodramatics as at the idea of my

the strange case of nathaniel broome
old friend having so lugubrious a his-
tory
  well lets knock at the terrible ban-
dits portals mrs muzzard i said
mockingly and see if we can persuade
him to show himself
  i pulled the cord of my dressing-gown
tightly about my waist and the action
as i did so seemed whimsically like that
of an ancient warrior girding up his
loins
  come i said i shall do the beard-
ing of the lion you may shelter your-
self behind me surely if there are any
evil spirits to confront they will have
to tackle me first
  we crossed the dark hallway and
stopped in the shadows at the closed
door of the mysterious room
  i tapped gently upon the panel
  there was no answer
  again i rapped upon the door
  he must be out after all i mut-
tered as there came no reply and to
my own amazement i breathed a sigh
of relief
  i swear to god mr scrimgeour
exclaimed mrs muzzard in a hoarse
whisper i swear to god he aint set
foot outside this door today
  she crouched close behind me her
whole body shaking with excitement
her breath coming in sharp gasps
through her set teeth unaccountably i
thought of a terrier bristling with fear
at something it cannot understand
  as we listened something of her
perturbation cdpimunicated itself to
me 
  can it be i thought that the wo-
man has some reason for her fantastic
premonitions then preposterous
incredible
  he may not have come in at all last
night i ventured trying now to re-
assure myself as well as my frightened
companion
  you must have heard him as plain
as i did mr scrimgeour she replied
with startling vehemence hes so
heavy on the stairs
  i remembered now that i had heard
surely hen he is asleep we had
better not wake him
  knock again mr scrimgeour for
gods sake knock again
  seized by a sudden excitement i
rapped heavily frantically upon the
panel of the door so hard did i use
my knuckles that a sharp pain shot
through them and glancing down at my
fingers i saw that i had broken the skin
iv
  tense now with inexplicable excite-
ment we both stood listening our heads
bent toward the closed door
  good god what was that sobbed
mrs muzzard hysterically as i fancied
that i could hear a low groan
  broome broome i called all my
eerie apprehension vanished the man
was sick perhaps dying-
  broome i called again jerking at
the handle of the door
  again we heard the groan this time
louder than before
  for gods sake broome open the
door man i called
  you-must-not-come-in-
the words were spoken with very
great difficulty as if the unfortunate
man were suffering in intense agony
  are you ill i called it is i
scrimgeour dont be afraid but tell
me broome if you are ill we must
help you you have locked the door
i am-not-ill again the same tor-
tured voice forcing itself to speak
through an ecstasy of pain you-must
-not-come-in
  oh god-god-god shrieked
mrs muzzard in terror i tell you
that mans a devil hes at some of his
ghost tricks now hell have all the
powers of hell down on us jesus
mary and joseph may me sins be for-
the strange case of nathaniel broome

given oh blessed mary stand betune
us and harm
  shut up you idiot i cried cant
you realize that the mans been taken
suddenly ill he naturally lockcd the
door last night when he went to bed
and lies too sick to get up and open it
for us
  then what are we to do she
moaned making ineffectual gestures in
the air with her hands
  well have to break open the door
get me a hammer or if you have an
axe or something heavy 
  ill run right away and get mrs
seagles next door
  you-must not-open-the-door
came again slowly ominously from the
inner room
  during several moments-moments
that were age-long-i stood still rooted
to the floor unable to move my limbs
utterly powerless to cry out
  at my sharp command mrs muzzard
had disappeared more than eagerly i
fancied in search of a battering imple-
ment
  she returned a few minutes later
with an axe which she had succeeded in
borrowing from her neighbor
  there seemed such a feeling of actu-
ality in the stout wooden handle of the
axe that as i gripped it in my hands i
felt my courage returning
  look out broome i shouted if
youre up keep away from the door
im going to break it in and with that
i dealt a heavy blow upon the upper
panel
  the voice inside became a strangled
inarticulate scream
  behind me mrs muzzard cowered a
heap of jabbering fear upon the floor
  seized in a sort of panic i rained
blow after blow with my stout axe upon
the door i remember even in my ex-
citement comparing the scene with a
similar one as it would be staged in
moving pictures how quickly upon the
screen the door would have been burst
open and how in actuality it was so
difficult to split such resisting wood
  at last i managed to make an opening
through which i might insert my hand
and turn the key in the lock
  then the door swung open
  the window shades had been drawn
closely so that the place was in dark-
ness i groped my way to the bed
  broome i cried still breathless
from the unusual exertion whats the
matter and i leaned over the blurred
form that lay crouched in an unnatural
attitude upon the bed
  a little light mrs muzzard i
said over my shoulder as the landlady
crept shuddering into the room
  shewalked obediently to the window
  the dark form seemed to writhe in
agony then the shade was lifted and
the late morning light poured into the
room
v
  what i saw there will remain a fear-
ful image in my memory until the day
i die
  as i looked at that face upon the pil-
low the cold chill of horror pricked at
the roots of my hair clammy drops of
perspiration stood out upon my fore-
head i could feel the skin drawing into
gooseflesh over my spine
  nathaniel broome fully dressed his
body twisted unnaturally in the grip of
some strange paralytic seizure lay hud-
dled upon the bed his knees drawn up
until they touched his chin
  i called that creature by the name of
my old friend but the distorted mask
which i saw upon the pillow bore no re-
semblance to that placid face it was
the face of the fiend which mediaeval
sculptors have carved with gothic mon-
strousness in imperishable stone
  there was no nose only two terrible
holes where the flesh had been eaten
away

the strange case of nathaniel broome
  the cheeks were hideously twisted
into gnarled unnatural shapes the
dreadful mouth perverted to a silenic
grin leered lasciviously up at me
until i shrank back dizzy nauseated at
the repulsive sight of it
  i felt myself shaking with terror
this-this nightmare this phantasma
i could not take my eyes away for
above that horrible disfigurement of
flesh the deep soul-fathoming eyes of
my friend looked up wonderfully into
mine and held me in spite of all my
horror at the almost obscene ugliness
beneath them
  there was the same old immortal pa-
tience the world of understanding the
illimitable depths of pity pity for me
and there too at last i divined jvhat i
could never interpret before there
was the look which i had for so long
been unable to understand that look
was pain
  our gazes met mine telling all my
horror my terror my fear my abject
cowardice my disgust his immortal
patient all-wise all-knowing like the
eyes of god
  my poor friend- the gargoyles
mouth twisted and contorted shockingly
in an effort to form the words i can-
not speak this seizure has taken sud-
den hold upon me this face-this
ghouls head-
 have pity-have pity upon my
weakness i faltered in the tremulous
whisper of a frightened child i was
too much unnerved even to attempt a
concealment of my horror i cant help
myself i know that this is only physi-
cal with you i know that we have no
mastery of our flesh when you are
well again i will show you how really
much i feel for you in your terrible mis-
fortune
  i looked appealingly down into the
all-pitying light of those unfathomable
eyes i tried to see only his eyes i
tried with all my soul to forget the
frightful contortion beneath them and
slowly there stole over me a sense of il-
limitable calm
  my very good friend the low voice
articulating slowly and painfully came
to me as through a mist of dreams i
am dying i have been waiting trying
to prepare for this during several
months now it has come after i have
been laid away you may care to know
   some day you may wish to un-
derstand   
  i have made provision for that both
for you and for one other whom you
will meet after i have gone
  his face working in frightful con-
tortion my friend lifted a hand point-
ing tremulously to the paper-littered
table
  i had forgotten mrs muzzard who
had apparently been standing by the
window as i moved from the bedside
where my body had been screening the
dying man she caught sight of his face
upon the pillow
  with a shrill scream lifting her hands
to cover her eyes she fell a crumpled
heap upon the floor
  managing to control myself until a
doctor was summoned i had my tragi-
cally unfortunate friend removed to a
hospital
  poor mrs muzzard went out of one
fit of hysterics into another so that i
was obliged to lay sufficient hold upon
myself to plead with one of the neigh-
bors for aid in attending her
  all these necessary duties served to
keep my mind from dwelling upon the
terrible ordeal through which we had
gone but late into the night i lay toss-
ing upon my bed unable to sleep i did
not dare put out the light in my room
so fearful was i of the shadows of the
dark
  all night long i was haunted haunted
afraid to close my eyes lest i should see
that grim vision of distorted flesh
  once a window-shutter loose from
i
the strange case of nathaniel broome

its fastenings swayed noisily in the
wind and i screamed in terror
  but when the dawn came and the gas
grew wan against the light of day with
weariness and exhaustion i fell at last
into a deep sleep
vi
  i was awakened by a knocking at the
door
  come in i called but in a voice
which i could scarce recognize as my
own
  mrs seagle the neighbor who had
taken care of my stricken landlady
pushed an untidy head through the open
doorway
  theres someone to see you sir she
said
  it was someone from the office i fan-
cied to know why i had not gone to
work i felt a wave of rebellious an-
noyance because for this one dreadful
day i might not be left in peace
  well i cried petulantly as mrs
seagle did not move show the man
up
  its a lady
a lady i echoed in consternation
the woman grinned meaningly at me
  confound your impudence i cried
show the lady into mrs muzzards
parlor
  mrs muzzard aint got no parlor
the woman retorted retreating in some
apprehension at my vehemence
  well then show her into one of the
vacant rooms downstairs while i put my
coat on
  as i entered the stuffy room a few
moments later a fall figure clad in black
arose from one of the hideous horse-
hair chairs and approached me
  are you mr scrimgeour she
asked her voice was low and musically
soft i looked into a pair of large wist-
ful eyes something about them seemed
familiar to me
  you are   i hesitated wonder-
ingly
  i am the daughter of nathaniel
broome she replied and for a moment
the heavy lids lowered over her eyes
  i have come from montreal the
day before yesterday i received a tele-
gram from my father saying that he was
ill so of course i came at once
but have you seen your father miss
broome 
  i called here early this morning and
was told of my poor fathers seizure
i wasnt told that anyone had called
i observed its perhaps due to the
fact that mrs muzzard is ill you see
everything is in confusion here   
a neighbor  
  yes i have learned that
  and your father i asked
  my father mr scrimgeour is
dead
  i could only stare dumb and aston-
ished why havent i been told i
exclaimed at last to die like that
friendless and forsaken
  i have just come from my fathers
bedside she replied i am here to
bring you the sad news
  good god i exclaimed suddenly
remembering you saw    you
saw     i dreaded to ask yet
wanted most frantically to know
  i cant understand why the young
girl went on looking inquiringly at me
but the nurses at the hospital wouldnt
let me take the cloth from my fathers
face
  i did not dare to look into her eyes
i could not reply
  my father once told me in one of his
letters that in case of anything happen-
ing to him i was to come to you for
advice and for guidance i have come
now will you tell me what you know 
it all seems very strange i   
im at a loss to understand you will
not refuse
  with the pleading charm of her eyes

the strange case of nathaniel broome
her overwhelming beauty encompassed
me like a wave of some divine ether car-
rying me off my middle-aged feet
  dear friend i replied scarce able
to keep the agitation from my voice i
shall refuse you nothing in my power
your father has left a number of pa-
pers which he hinted to me in words i
didnt understand would tell us all we
wished to know my heart wanned
under the look of gratitude in her eyes
  and those papers where are they
she cried eagerly
  the room i fancy is still untouched
as we left it yesterday
  let us go then  i am all impatience
gravely i led the way upstairs to the
ill-fated room the naked boards of
the old stairs creaked abominably as we
trod upon them and thinking of the
wretchedness of the upper rooms i
was ashamed
vii
  the papers upon the table lay just as
they had been left upon the previous
day
  each page is numbered said miss
broome looking them over we shall
find little difficulty in reading them
she busied herself collating the scat-
tered leaves bending her head to hide
the turbulent emotion in her eyes
  turning with a wistful smile she
handed them to me
  here they are in their correct order
she said would you care to read them
aloud to me
  as you wish i replied gravely ac-
cepting the papers
  i hesitated for a moment glancing at
the young girl her radiant freshness
seemed to be smothered in that tawdry
setting
  ill open the window i ventured
the place is airless
  the manuscript bore every evidence
of hasty writing and was difficult at
first to read but after a page or two
i grew accustomed to it and went on
smoothly enough my companion listen-
ing quietly not uttering a word
  what follows here has been copied
down word for word from that astound-
ing narrative known as the strange
case of nathaniel broome
viii
  feeling that i have only a short
while to live i must try to set down as
clearly and as concisely as possible the
true story of my unfortunate life
  scrimgeour who has proved so big-
hearted a friend has a right to know
how often have i not seen that look of
baffled inquiry in his gentle eyes when
they rested upon my seemingly quiet
untroubled face
  and marguerite my daughter who
has been the object of my deepest af-
fection what must she think of me
poor child she too has every right to
be told
  but such a tale fantastic incredible
as the ravings of an opium-haunted
nightmare   
  my hand trembles my eyes grow
misty i must make haste before it is
too late
  my father lemuel broome was an
artist and from him together with great
physical beauty i inherited a deep
aesthetic feeling for the beautiful
  my mother died upon giving birth
to me i was their only child
  i learned in my childish years to seek
for beauty and to know beauty in
every tiling
  beauty is virtue ugliness is sin
that my father used to say to me
is all you know and all you need to
know
  small wonder is it then that as i
grew from boyhood through youth to
manhood sheltered and alone with my
father this doctrine of beauty grew
the strange case of nathaniel broome

with me became a part of my very soul
  i shunned all ugliness ugly thoughts
ugly places ugly people the servants
about my fathers house and estate were
chosen for their good looks and not for
their trustworthiness or their honesty
  my education was given me by pri-
vate tutor at home so that i need not
suffer the vulgar contamination of a
public school in fact until after his
death i had scarce set foot outside the
high stone walls of my fathers home
  when i was twenty years of age my
father died
  ignorant as i was of business or of
the ugly ways of the world i was a fair
target for the cunning of any scoundrel
who might chance to come into my
path
  such an enterprising person was my
tutor james shirley he was probably
the most physically perfect specimen of
a man that i have ever seen but to
that flawless beauty there was added an
equally flawless lack ofmoral principle
  the details of his swindles and more
heinous crimes may be found among
the prison records suffice it to say that
before james shirley died he had suc-
ceeded in robbing me of almost every-
thing i possessed then reduced prac-
tically to beggar i met the woman
who since became my wife
  though angela has been dead fifteen
years i still cannot think of her with-
out emotion she was the most beauti-
ful woman whom i have ever seen the
most radiantly lovely a wealth of grace
of tender sweetness and charm for
five years we lived a life of well-nigh
perfect happiness
  it is true my wife could never quite
understand my unusual outlook upon
life she was amazed and sometimes a
little fearful of my acute physical hor-
ror of ugliness yet secure in her own
surpassing loveliness she sought only to
please me and to be pleasing in my eyes
  shortly after our daughter mar-
  guerite was born i began to notice a
change in angela it was not that she
had grown less beautiful for mother-
hood had only added a new tenderness
to her charms no the subtle change
which i divined in her and mutely won-
dered at was to be found only in the ex-
pression of her eyes the change which
i thought could be noticed in them how-
ever was something that for a long
time i could not find words to explain
  one evening as we sat together talk-
ing in the twilight following some odd
remark of hers i glanced sharply at her
and caught the weird expression for a
moment in her face
  my dearest i exclaimed is there
something the matter
  she smiled and the strange look van-
ished
  why do you ask that question  she
returned then i told her of the fears
which i had lately felt concerning her
  my explanation seemed deeply to
move her
  oh my dear my dear she cried
you fill me with horror for days past
i have been trying to argue with myself
that it has all been my childish fancy
i have told myself that over and over
again but now  if you too have
seen it it must be true
  tell me for heavens sake i cried
in alarm tell me what it is
  oh im so much afraid the ter-
ror of it has haunted me for so long
and yet you will protect me-if its
humanly possible to be protected
that is my right dear i answered
tell me
  come then she replied and led me
to the large mirror hanging above the
mantel-piece
  stand perfectly still behind me so
and look with all your courage at my re-
flection in the glass
  white with excitement engendered by
the deathly seriousness of her words i
stood as she bade me and gazed at our

the strange case of nathaniel broome
  two faces pale and drawn reflected in
the mirror
  her countenance beautiful as a ma-
donnas was aglow from the flickering
mellow light of the grate fire i stared
at her half mad with her loveliness
  you have never been so beautiful
i began the scent from her hair and
the nearness of her adorable self the
smoothness of her bare shoulders made
the blood leap intoxicatingly in my
veins i wanted to kneel to her i
yearned with all my soul to worship to
abase my body at her exquisite feet
you are wonderfully beautiful-
wait-wait keep looking into the
mirror she whispered -
  is there-is there any change she
asked fearfully
  no i replied and she gave a deep
sigh of relief then slowly her image
in the mirror began to grow misty and
indistinct
 its a trick i cried and my voice
seemed high and strained its a trick
you are playing a joke upon me
  then it is true i heard her say in
a hard cold voice
 what-in gods name
  look look and you shall see
  the blurred image in the looking-
glass started to clear
  but instead of the face of my wife
there began to take shape an image so
hideous so ghoulish that i can only
compare it to the disintegration of-of
a human corpse
ix
  at this point in the extraordinary
narrative i stopped reading for hap-
pening to glance up from the manu-
script i saw such horror in my listen-
ers eyes that i had not the courage to
continue
  it is too harrowing i said i
must not go on
  read read my friend replied miss
broome shielding her eyes with her
hands i wondered at the remarkable
nervous force displayed by one so
young
  then first allow me to get you a
drink of water i replied
  she thanked me with a gracious incli-
nation of her head as i returned with
the glass as she accepted it from my
hand her cool fingers touched me some-
thing leaped in my turgid veins at the
contact and i resumed the reading of
the story
x
 there was something however
which i was able to notice even during
the panic of fear that possessed me i
saw that the mysterious transmission of
flesh had not changed the eyes i seized
my wife by the shoulders and turned
her sharply about
  her face was as i had always seen it
radiantly hauntingly beautiful the only
change was in her eyes staring search-
ingly into them i tried with all my mind
to read what i saw there and the look
that was in them was pain
  we were both of us horribly fright-
ened after our extraordinary experi-
ence and sat up discussing it all night
long while little marguerite all unsus-
pecting lay sleeping peacefully upstairs
  the gruesome illusion hung over our
spirits for days neither one of us
dared to leave the other for a moment
alone the shadows were peopled with
ghosts and dark places became hideous
with the hidden menace
  i had all the mirrors in the house re-
moved and when we went out into the
streets i hurried my wife past shop
windows with averted eyes afraid to see
in some chance looking-glass the spec-
tre that had become the terror of our
lives
  i	awoke each morning afraid to look
into her eyes i went to sleep beside her
the strange case of nathaniel broome

with dread in my miserable soul for
always the terror haunted us that some
day i should look into her face and see
without the mirrors baleful aid that fes-
tering putrefaction of flesh and bone
xi
  we sent marguerite to a convent near
montreal so that she poor child might
be spared the agonies that kept us fear-
ful and eternal company
  then at last the menace that for so
many weeks had hung over us took tan-
gible shape
  we had been trying to talk lightly to-
gether one evening trying pitifully to
avoid the one subject uppermost in our
minds
  i was sitting close to my wife with an
arm about her waist suddenly i felt
her body shiver slightly under my touch
  what is it i asked are you
cold
  the answer came to me in halting
distorted words as if she were speak-
ing with very great difficulty
  youll not escape from me if i have
to follow you from the grave i but the
voice that spoke was not the voice of my
wife labored painwracked though it
was i could recognize it it was the
voice of my old tutor james shirley
  i leaped from my chair and in the
horror that was written in my face my
wife needed no mirror to see that at
last the dreaded visitation had come and
that the fleshly metamorphosis had
taken place
  for one agonizing moment i caught
the look of pain of unutterable agony
in her eyes then with a strangled
scream she fled from me to hide the
loathsome body which had taken pos-
session of her from my sight
  i followed wildly to her bedroom
pounding ineffectually upon the door i
could hear her inside screaming and
jabbering meaningless noises she
must have gone completely out of her
mind
  then followed the sound of some-
thing falling and the smash of breaking
glass i knew that the lamp had been
overturned a moment later the smell
of burning came to me through the door
  my desperate efforts finally succeeded
in getting the door open
  i found the room ablaze the oil from
the lamp having spread all over the
carpet the window curtains had
caught fire and the place was thick with
smoke
  but writhing on the floor a mass of
leaping venomous flame my wife jay
filling the choking air with agonizing
shrieks and heart-rending groans
  i seized her with one arm attempting
with the other hand to beat out the
flames but they only leaped about her
more triumphantly than before
  by this time the conflagration had
spread about us and i was obliged to
carry her downstairs and out into the
street
  i found shelter for my melancholy
burden with some kind neighbors
meanwhile my home was given over to
the flames
xii
 angela never spoke again her
charred and mutilated body was buried
but i alone knew what it was which we
had put into the grave for the ma-
lignity which had pursued her finding
an easier entry into her passive mind
did not rest with her death the evil
spirit transferred itself to me
  in the phantom-haunted grisly years
that followed through nights of fiendish
mental torture and of bodily agony i
learned a terrible intimacy with her
ghostly murderer
  what i have found out will be in-
credible and preposterous to those who
know nothing of spirit visitation or pos-

the strange case of nathaniel broome
session to those narrow-minded skep-
tics who brush aside all evidence of
psychic phenomena as the unhinged
ravings of the insane
  scrimgeour who has known me inti-
mately during the last few months can
vouch however for my sanity and my
reason
  but i have other evidences to support
my statements i have the testimony of
a host of scientific investigators as well
as the indisputable experiences of
countless men and women who have
given years to the study of this ex-
traordinary mystery
  and more than all these i know-i
know i who write these lines trem-
bling with fear at the fate awaiting me
lurking here in my very room waiting
patiently craftiness cunning incarnate
sometimes he sits in that far-off corner
leering at me contorting his ghastliness
into still more loathsome expressions
there he taunts me dares me whisper-
ing to me words so lewd so obscene so
frightful that i wonder the very walls
do not tumble about us at their lasciv-
ious echoes
  and i know that soon soon he will
come nearer he will dare to come
nearer as he dared with my wifes most
beautiful body he will take posses-
sion of me as he took possession of her
  already i have seen his shadow in the
glass and i know that it is the begin-
ning of the end
  james shirley who lived a life of
crime of loathsome debauch and lasciv-
iousness upon earth james shirley
whose body has long lain putrescent in
its convicts grave will creep at last
into my soul my brain will take pos-
session of my very body leaving me
only his rotting carcass which lies
mouldering in its tomb   
xiii
  here the manuscript ended the pa-
pers dropped from my fingers and fell
rustling to the floor
  between us for several moments there
was complete silence the girls cheeks
were white as marble her eyes big with
terror
  through the open window the quiet
hum of the street traffic reached us
borne on the summer breeze there the
days occupation spent itself in calm
unhurrying routine   
  i	could hear a messenger boy whis-
tling merrily   
  a young girl laughed
  the clanging of insistent bells min-
gled with the occasional drone of motor
horns life with its unimaginative
sameness was near was all about us
yet we had no part in it
  robbed by death of his earth body
james shirley had killed twice in his
feverish yearning to live again i
seemed to feel the presence of his ma-
levolent spirit hovering about us an
eidolon reaching out lustful discarnate
arms trying longing aching for life
  marguerite broome transcendently
beautiful with all the delicate aroma
the fresh intoxication of flowers about
her sat before me under the shadow of
an impending doom and i old with-
ered ridiculous in my new-found emo-
tions i who loved her i who wor-
shipped her could only stare at her im-
potent and pitifully afraid   
the man who would not die
by harold ward
a woman young handsome
richly dressed lay dead on-the
sidewalk over her stood a
young man hatless his hair
mussed his face bruised and bleed-
ing around them-the living and
the dead-the crowd surged held back
by a little cordon of blue-coated police-
men a police automobile its gong
clanging raucously dashed up to the
curb and a tall broad-shouldered man
in plain clothes leaped out and elbowed
his way through the throng of curiosity
seekers to the sergeant in charge
  great heavens casey he ex-
claimed as his glance fell upon the face
of the woman do you know who she
is
  casey touched his cap respectfully
tliis chap here says that shes mrs
augustus winters the young wife that
old winters the millionaire married a
couple of years ago used to be an ac-
tress before she married him i under-
stand i dont know the lady myself
inspector
  the big man nodded hes right
casey its mrs winters all right
he caught himself with a start no
by george it isnt
  the bareheaded young man with the
bruised face interrupted you are
wrong sir i know that it is mrs win-
ters
  the inspector gave him a quick look
you mean that you think it is she
the fact of the matter is that mrs
winters died suddenly yesterday after-
noon
  you must be wrong argued the
other stubbornly i have waited on
mrs winters hundreds of times i
know her as well as i know myself
and she was alive and well ten min-
utes ago
  couldnt you be mistaken ill ad-
mit that this woman looks enough like
her to be her double must be her sis-
ter
  i insist that you are wrong sir ill
take my oath that this is mrs winters
lying there
  inspector des moines scratched his
chin reflectively its got me beat
he declared theres only one thing
to do under the circumstances casey
-get the body to the morgue and send
for old winters to identify it ask
him if his wife was a twin and
turning to the young man you get
your hat and come on with me to the
station i want to have a talk with you
ii
  seated at the big flat-top desk in his
well appointed office des moines light-
ed a cigar in silence offered another to
his companion then suddenly de-
manded 
  now come clean young fellow
whats the story behind this affair
lets have the straight of it
  the lad-he was scarcely more than
a boy-gulped to hide his agitation
  i-i- he stammered
  the inspector smiled kindly dont
get scared my boy dont get scared
bless your heart sonny i know that
you didnt kill the woman i only want
to get at the facts in the case as speed-
ily as possible just forget my gruff
way of speaking-its my natural
voice
i hardly know how to start began


the man who would not die
the other his fears vanishing under the
inspectors kindly manner the lady
-mrs winters-came into harden 
companys store where i am employed
as head salesman in the jewelry depart-
ment and asked to be shown something
rather nifty in a diamond brooch
that was yesterday afternoon she
looked at a number of pieces finally
selecting one valued at thirty thousand
dollars she asked me to lay it aside
for her stating that she wanted her
mother who was buying it for her for
a birthday present to look at it before
she made her final decision
  this morning she returned and
coming into the store requested that i
accompany her to the curb with the
brooch as her mother who was an in-
valid was outside in the limousine of
course it was irregular but she is an
old customer-you know harden 
companys policy-so i did as request-
ed i handed her the jewel case just
as we reached the machine and she
passed it in to the woman-whom i
supposed was her mother-who was
leaning back against the cushions the
curtains were down and the interior
was in semi-darkness so i did not get
a clear view of the face of the lady
  just as she handed the other the
jewel the chauffeur who had been
keeping his engine running leaned out
and slugged me with something-a
sandbag i imagine at the same time
mrs winters made a quick leap for
the interior of the machine but in-
voluntarily as i fell i grasped her and
we went down in a heap together
  the chauffeur immediately started
his machine and before i recovered my
wits which had been largely knocked
out of me he was around the corner
i didnt even have an opportunity to
get the number of the auto
  we have already attended to that
interrupted the inspector casey
have it down in his notebook if anyone
in the vicinity chanccd to notice it
were there many people on the side-
walk at the time
  they were constantly passing-the
usual ten oclock crowd
  um-m-m all right go ahead with
your story
  there is nothing more to tell
when i came to my senses-and i
couldnt have been dazed more than a
second or two-the machine was dis-
appearing around the corner as i just
told you and the woman was lying on
the sidewalk beside me-dead it must
have-been apoplexy inspector for ill
swear on a stack of bibles that i didnt
seize her hard enough to kill her he
hesitated then continued haltingly
but what puzzles me is why mrs
winters-a woman of untold wealth-
would stoop to aid in a crime like that
he looked at the inspector for an
answer to his question the latter
smoked in silence for a second thats
what weve got to find out my boy
you said your name was-
  johnson-adolph johnson
  oh yes and she got away clean
with the jewelry did she the other
woman-the one in the machine-and
the chauffeur
  johnson nodded
  they were interrupted by a rap at die
door in response to des moines gruff
come in casey entered his good-na-
tured red face glowing with excitement
  what the dickens do you know about
it sir he exploded winters has
identified the body positively as being
that of his wife
  but mrs winters died yesterday af-
ternoon
  she did but sometime during the
night her body disappeared and this
morning they found the body of her
maid dead in the casket from which the
mistress had been taken
  good god murdered
  not a mark on her body
i
 stepped to the casket the body of my wife was gone hi its place was the
body of dolly her maid cold in death-page 


the man who would not die
iii
  before the inspector could recover
from his astonishment the door burst
open and a man grey-haired tall angu-
lar-beyond the middle age-rushed in
without the formality of rapping his
wrinkled face was drawn and haggard
his eyes bloodshot and red from weep-
ing his whole appearance that of a man
almost bereft of his senses
  inspector he shrieked who is the
guilty man who has desecrated the
poor dead body of my wife who stole
it from the casket damn them damn
them damn them who murdered
dolly her maid  she was murdered i
say i know it i know it
  he glared about him for a second
then give him to me i say ill
tear the scoundrel to pieces with my
naked hands give him to me i de-
mand justice
  he dropped into a chair and burst into
hysterical sobs for an instant there
was silence des moines chewed thought-
fully on his cigar johnson white-faced
unused to scenes such as this fidgeted
nervously his fingers twitching assum-
ing the quieting tone of a mother ad-
dressing her child the inspector turned
to the weeping man
  calm yourself mr winters he be-
gan slowly i know that its hard-
its awful terrible but well get at the
bottom of it some way i promise you
on my word as a man that ill capture
the guilty wretch and hang him yes
curse him ill hang him higher than a
kite or ill quit the force but the affair
is growing more puzzling every minute
i cant make head nor tail out of it as it
stands now wont you let me hear your
story 
  winters sat up and dried his eyes
what can i tell you he sobbed how
shall i begin
  start with the death of your wife
  there is little to tell she was strick-
en suddenly yesterday afternoon while
dressing to go out dolly matthews her
maid who was with her at the time hast-
ily summoned assistance but she passed
away before the doctor arrived-in fact
even before the servants who responded
to miss matthews cries could reach her
the physician-doctor bennett the well
known specialist-gave as his opinion
that the cause of death was heart failure
  the body was prepared for burial in
the usual way i sat beside the casket
until nearly morning then in response
to the urgent appeals of the friends and
relatives who had rushed to my side in
my hour of trouble i surrendered my
post to miss matthews the poor girl
loved my wife devotedly and was terribly
grief stricken over her untimely death
and now shes gone too he burst
into another paroxysm of sobbing des
moines waited until he regained control
of himself then motioned for him to
continue
  i could not content myself my
nerves were nearly at the breaking point
although the physician had given me an
opiate to quiet me after lying on the
bed and tossing around for an hour or
two i arose and again sought the side of
my dear one i was surprised not to find
miss matthews in the room which was
empty although therg were several peo-
ple in the study just across the hall
  i stepped to the casket as there is
a god in heaven the body of my wife
was gone in its place was the body of
dolly her maid cold in death
  there was no evidence of foul play in
the case of the maid 
  no although i am certain under the
circumstances that she was murdered
she couldnt have died a natural death
and crawled into the casket herself could
she he glared at the inspector as if
expecting a denial receiving no answer
he continued
  my cries brought those who were in
the other room and we immediately sum-
the man who would not die

moned doctor bennett who made an
examination he would not even venture
an opinion as to what caused death
  meanwhile i was almost beside my-
self can you blame me we searched
the house from cellar to garret looking
for the remains of my wife failing to
find her body we were about to call up
police headquarters-which we should
have done in the beginning-when i re-
ceived the call to go to the morgue there
i found the poor dear i demand that
immediate steps be taken to bring the
perpetrator of the hellish deed to jus-
tice i am a wealthy man i will spend
every cent i possess to hang the wretch
damn him
  inspector des moines scratched his
chin reflectively its got me beat mr
winters ill confess that i never came
across a case like this in all of my twenty
years on the force you are ready to
swear that your wife died yesterday af-
ternoon and that you saw her body in
the coffin a reputable physician made an
examination and pronounced her dead
yet- are you sure that the body you
examined in the morgue is that of mrs
winters 
   positively i identified it not only by
her sweet girlish face but by a small
birthmark on her left shoulder
  she had no sister she was not a
twin
  shewas an only child
  then mr winters how do you rec-
oncile your story with that of mr john-
son here who swears that the woman
whose body you saw in the morgue and
have identified as your wife was alive
and well at ten oclock this morning
yes he even goes farther and asserts
that he talked to her and that she aided
by two others robbed harden  com-
pany of a valuable diamond brooch
winters leaped to his feet his eyes
blazing his face aflame with rage lies
an infernal liar and a blackguard-
before he could continue there was a
b m-sept-
rap at the door des moines secretary
entered he handed the inspector an en-
velope marked important winters
case
  the policeman tore the envelope open
and glanced hastily over the contents
then with an oath he read it aloud to
the others
  my dear inspector i have just start-
ed i am lessman the man -who laughs
at death i killed mrs winters i
killed her as i have killed others-and as
i wiil kill again-by the power of
thought alone unravel that if you can
  what is death my dear inspector
who knows no one but me whai is
the human body  only a prison in which
the soul is confined-a piece of clay to
be discarded at will god kills when he
wishes why not i it suited my pur-
pose to use the mortal form of mrs
winters and i took it
  hereafter i will give you due and
timely notice of each crime i commit-
and i assure you that they will be nu-
merous
  with best wishes i sign myself
lessman the man who will not die
iv
  the winters mystery was the most
interesting news event of the day and
the afternoon papers made the most of
it at its best the city administration
was not a favorite with the press au-
gustus winters was wealthy and popu-
lar his wife had been one of the leaders
of the faster young society set as a re-
sult the police department was grilled to
a turnover for what was termed the
laxity of its methods
  inspector des moines accustomed to
the vagaries of journalism used to being
praised one day and reviled the next
gave little heed to what was said or writ-
ten about him or his department yet
he read every detail carefully in the hope
that the reporters had gathered some

the man who would not die
new evidence that would tend to help
in working out the solution of the puz-
zle for in the past he had secured much
valuable help from the newspaper men
but this time he was doomed to disap-
pointment they could find nothing-
absolutely nothing--that gave him any
additional light
  nothing had been left undone men
from the inspectors office had combed
the city in search of a clew to the mys-
terious lessman but without avail
only the machine used in the harden 
company robbery had been found
stolen earlier in the day from a garage
in the outskirts of the city it had been
abandoned by the side of a country road
when the users were through with it be-
yond that one small detail no headway
had been made
  the newspapers had assigned their
best man to the case they could secure
not even a trace of the unknown perpe-
trator of the startling crimes-for des
moines had not thought it advisable to
take the press into his confidence in so
far as the threatening letter he had re-
ceived was concerned
  tired and disgruntled he was about
to leave the office for the night when the
phone on his desk thrilled he picked
the receiver from its hook and answered
  inspector des moines queried a
heavy male voice
  des moines answered in the affirma-
tive the man at the other end of the
line chuckled to himself
  well  growled the inspector did
you call me to the phone at this time of
the night to tell me a joke
  instantly the quiet laughter ceased
and the voice came clear and strong
across the space no inspector i beg
your pardon this is lessman speak-
ing-lessman the man who will not
die i imagined that i would catch you
in your office i had a notion to call
around and see you then thought better
of it can you understand me all right
  now listen to me carefully des
moines i told you that i would give
you fair warning when i was ready to
make my next move i always keep my
word are you listening tomorrow
morning on the stroke of ten i am go-
ing to kill a man where oh no i
have no objection to telling you where-
on the street in front of  broadway
-yes  broadway probably a
policeman no no not you but be
on the job inspector i am doing this
for a purpose i hate the police damn
them but it will give you an opportu-
nity of studying my methods ha ha
you and i will match wits frequently
from now on
  oh yes before i say good night ill
make you a promise if youll be pres-
ent tomorrow ill promise you that i
will do my best to hunt you up and talk
with you you need not go to the trou-
ble of notifying the papers for i have
done that myself ive asked them all
to send their best men thats all for
this time good-bye
  the receiver at the other nd was
hung up with a click
  then des moines was galvanized into
action frantically he jiggled the hook
up and down until central answered
sharply
  quick he demanded this is in-
spector des moines at headquarters
where did that call come ffom just
now  get on the job and find out fifty
dollars in it for you if youll find out
immediately
  hold the line please
  thirty seconds later his vigilance was
rewarded
  this is the chief operator the call
you inquired about came from booth
number fourteen at the biltmore send
the reward to operator one-hundred-
and-six please
  to secure a connection with the
switchboard operator at the biltmore re-
quired only an instant
the man who would not die	
  inspector des moines headquar-
ters speaking a man just called me up
from booth number fourteen theres a
ten in it for you if youll get a descrip-
tion of him for me inside of a minute
do you understand  move fast
  you can send the ten right along in-
spector the man who used booth num-
ber fourteen stopped at the desk and
gave me a tip as he passed out he just
went through the door a second ago
fine fine his description
quick
  you know him inspector it was
augustus winters the millionaire
v
  inspector des moines was a man
of action while even his best friends
did not claim for him the brilliancy of a
sherlock holmes a cleek of the forty
faces an arsene lupin or any of the
other celebrated sleuths of fiction yet
once given the slender thread of a clew
he followed it to the end the taunting
telephone call led him to believe that in
augustus winters he had the master
mind who was directing the crimes in the
millionaires own household why win-
ters would make way with his wife and
her maid-for the detective was firmly
of the belief that both women had been
murdered-he did not attempt to reason
out he only knew that a crime had
been committed and that he as an officer
of the law was pledged to find the mur-
derer regardless of who he might be
just now all straws pointed to augustus
winters himself
  he believed that winters had over-
looked a point in telephoning from a
public booth in a hotel where he was so
well known that he was likely to recall
his indiscretion and in an effort to re-
trieve his lost ground hasten home in
order to provide himself with an alibi
the officer believed would be his next
move consequently to checkmate that
alibi and prove it false from its very in-
ception was the obvious thing to do
  he reached for the telephone again
and called the number of the million-
aires residence not over three or four
minutes had elapsed since winters-
or lessman as the inspector believed
him to be-had talked to him from the
biltmore to drive from the hotel to
his home would take the better part of
an hour even with a fast car it would
take nearly as long to go from head-
quarters and there was always the
danger of an accident des moines
thought rapidly then made his decision
the telephone was faster and better than
making the trip in person and standing
the possible chance of having the aged
criminal-and the inspector now had no
doubts on that score-reach there first
  a sleepy voice answered his ring
augustus winters residence it said
who is this  he demanded
wilkins the butler sir
  has mr winters returned yet
  he has not been out sir
  let me talk to him then des moines
chuckled softly to himself as he made
the demand he knew that there was no
possibility of the millionaire replying
and the testimony of wilkins would
support his charges when the time came
to prove the falsity of the alibi
  ill connect you with his room sir
answered the butler a second later the
inspector was astonished to hear the
clear calm voice of winters at the other
end of the wire it nearly floored him
he was almost too nonplussed to reply
for winters obviously could not be in
two places at once if this was win-
ters then the man who had called him
up from the biltmore must necessarily
be an impostor and what manner of
man was he who could disguise
himself so cleverly that even those who
were personally acquainted with the
millionaire mistook the counterfeit for
the real

the man who would not die
  des moines speaking when did
you get back  he asked casually making
an effort to hide the agitation that he
felt
  when did i get back i was not
aware that i had been away answered
the other testily what was it you
wanted inspector must be something
important to call up at two oclock
in the morning have you secured
some new information or possibly
you have the guilty wretch under ar-
rest 
  des moines knew that he was defeat-
ed the least he could do was back out
gracefully it was not necessary to di-
vulge his suspicions he informed win-
ters as casually as he was able of the
telephone message he had received from
the man who would not die re-
serving however the information that
the other had been masquerading as
winters then he abruptly hung up the
phone 
  the case was growing more puzzling
every minute instead of the telephone
call clearing up the mystery he was
forced to confess to himself that it only
made it darker
vi
 who was lessman the man who
termed himself the man who would
not die was there such a person
or was it an alias des moines
humped up in his chair chewing his
dry cigar went oyer the case detail by
detail figuratively speaking he held
it up to the light and dissected it bit by
bit piece by piece and when he had
completed the process he was obliged
to confess himself as much in the dark
as ever
 who was lessman who was the
man of iron nerve and diabolical cun-
ning could it be winters the in-
spector had been inclined to suspect the
aged moneybags-was still disposed to
do so-but what was his motive was
he insane had he the ability-and
the nerve-to carry out such a plot
and there too was his alibi cast-iron
puncture proof
  if winters was not lessman who
was could it be doctor bennett
the physician admittedly had more op-
portunity to commit the murders than
any one else but in his case too
there was lacking the motive could
young johnson the diamond salesman
be the man in his case there was a
motive-the theft of the brooch but
on the other hand there was nothing to
show that he had ever visited the win-
ters home under any pretext and it
was natural to suppose that the person
who could cause the death of both the
mistress and the maid must have had
sometime at least entree to the million-
aires residence des moines had had
both the physician and the salesman in-
vestigated the reports of his men ly-
ing on the desk before him showed
nothing against them
  who had spirited the body of mrs
winters from its casket how could
she a dead woman be alive and
johnson as well as other employees of
harden  company swore that she
had been they had seen her-talked
with her-nearly twenty-four hours
after her reported death how had the
body of the maid been placed in the
casket the mistress had occupied who
was the disguised man who had so
cleverly passed himself off on the em-
ployees of the biltmore as augustus
winters 
  it was not until dawn was breaking
that des moines gave up wrestling
with the problem and when at last
tired and stiff from his long vigil he
arose and stretched himself he was
forced to admit that he knew no more
than when he had first been called into
the case
  there was nothing to do but wait
the man who would not die

vii
    human nature is peculiar a circus
  always advertises a thriller as its chief
  attraction people attend in the hope of
  seeing the performer make the one lit-
  tle miscalculation that will end fatally
  the newspapers had heralded the an-
  nouncement sent them by less-
  man in huge type their front pages
  shrieked forth in colored ink and huge
  type the news that at ten oclock the
  mysterious man who in his letter con-
  fessed to the murder of mrs winters
  and her maid would take another life
    for miles people came for the pur-
  pose of enjoying what promised to be
  a thrilling spectacle a score of police-
  men attempted to stem the tide but
  without success around  broad-
  way the street was packed for blocks
  in either direction even the reserves
  were called into action
    in front of  a knot of police-
  men headed by inspector des moines
  in person waited stolidly silently in a
  suppressed fever of excitement like
  soldiers waiting the signal for an at-
  tack about them the crowd surged
  and stormed but bent upon keeping
  the fiend from carrying out his threat
  des moines had cleared the street for
  a space of nearly a hundred feet hold-
  ing the curiosity seekers back with his
  cordon of bluecoats
   hundreds of automobiles were
 caught in the vortex of humanity their
 drivers unable to either go forward or
 to back out the officers were forced
 to let well enough alone to handle the
 jam was a task beyond the power of
  the guardians of the law
    in one of the machines des moines
  recognized the pale haggard face of
  augustus winters the millionaire
  huddled up in the back seat his every
  movement showing the mental strain
  under which he was laboring caught
  the inspectors eye and beckoned des
moines shouldered his way through the
mass of humanity to the side of his
automobile
  ive been caught in the crowd in-
spector and were unable to get out
cant you help us you can understand
the awful agony that i am suffering at
such a time
  des moines shook his head dont
you realize mr winters that if it
were humanly possible id have this
street cleared and keep it cleared my
men are working in from the outside-
but itll be a job of hours im afraid
but my god man you are not
going  to allow this murder to take
place are you
  des moines shrugged his shoulders
out of the hundreds of thousands of
people packed in this vicinity mr
winters show me how to pick out the
one man-the man i want my hands
are tied there is nothing for me to
do i must bide my time and wait for
the fiend to strike
  suddenly the aged millionaire
clutched the others shoulder his
eyes dilated he leaned forward his
muscles twitching his face ashen and
drawn oh god he shrieked its
happening look look
   his long skinny forefinger pointed
far out over the heads of the crowd
and then he fell in a heap on the bot-
tom of the car in a dead faint
  des moines leaped upon the running
board of the machine and gazed in the
direction winters had pointed then
with a yell he jumped to the ground
and hurling people to the right and
left plunged through the mass of hu-
manity like a maddened bull
   for officer ryan a strapping figure
of a man with the muscular figure of
an athlete who a second before had
been in the prime of health had sud-
denly thrown his arms in the air for
an instant he wove backwards and for-
wards his face twisted every muscle

the man who would not die
tensed as if struggling against the un-
seen hands that were pulling him down
then he gave voice to a shrill hideous
agonized scream and lurching like a
drunken man for a pace or two crum-
pled up in a heap on the pavement
  a dozen of his brother officers
leaped to his assistance they were
hurled back as if by an electric shock
arising they fought against the invisi-
ble force that held them in its power
but without avail open-mouthed their
feet fastened to the pavements as by
steel bands they were forced to stand
and watch the torture of their comrade
  as des moines broke through the
edge of the crowd the unknown power
that held them in check lessened in
a body they dashed to the stricken
mans side and turned him on his back
his eyes were already glazing his
hands were cold and clammy on his
forehead was the sweat of death he
shivered spasmodically then his jaw
dropped lessman had struck the
man who would not die had won
another victory
  silence tense nerve-racking si-
lence eyes were peering heads mov-
ing on all sides excitement was visi-
ble on every face but no one spoke a
word the agony was too great
  boom high up in a tower a clock
was striking every eye was turned
towards it but still no word only
the soul-straining awful silence
  boom
  boom
  the clock was striking ten lessman
had kept his word to the minute a
woman screamed her shrill hysteri-
cal shriek broke the spell
  then over the heads of the silent
awe-filled crowd rang a burst of laugh-
ter-cold haunting diabolical laughter
-weird mysterious-the gloating of a
fiend
  pandemonium broke loose those in
the front lines frozen with supernatu-
ral terror turned white-faced from
the horror that they had witnessed and
sought an avenue of escape none
knew but the arch-fiend might continue
-that any moment others might fall
blasted like a tree after a lightning
stroke
  men fought and struggled to flee
from the invisible who knew less-
man might be he who stood beside you
even now he might be seeking another
victim nothing could stop him he
was omnipotent every man suspected
his neighbor the police labored with
club and fist it was like stemming the
oceans tide with a shovel it was a
panic a riot in which the stronger
trampled the weaker under foot there
was no mercy-only a desire to escape
from the spot men and women
dropped fainting exhausted dying
where they fell beneath the feet of
their maddened fellows their dying
screams only added to the fright of
those who rushed over them automo-
biles their drivers stricken by the fear
that mastered all dashed madly ahead
slaughtering and crippling the pave-
ment covered with dead and wounded
was like a battlefield it was a minia-
ture hell-an inferno created by the
diseased brain of a devil in human
form
  when the officers had finally com-
pleted their task and the street was
cleared-when the last ambulance had
departed with its ghastly load-des
moines looked about him for winters
he was gone an officer remembered
seeing the millionaires machine driv-
ing away its owner huddled up in the
back seat shrieking and babbling his
shoulders shaking with hysterical sobs
his face wearing the look of a man
who has just escaped from hades
  the inspector stood deep in thought
he said that hed speak to me and
yet-dammit all the man never lived
who could act such a part it cant be
the man who would not die

him and with a shake of his head
he returned to his duties

  in a lonely house in one of the out-
lying districts-a house set down in the
midst of great trees and gardens sur-
rounded by a high stone wall-dwelt a
man of extraordinary powers to his
neighbors he was merely an oriental
gentleman of wealth and refinement
who preferred solitude in an alien
country to a position of magnificence
and power in his own but to the initi-
ate-that little band of followers se-
lected from every walk of life-he was
the ambassador of a tiny group of
learned men who for centuries before
jesus the christ walked upon this
earth have been striving to bring about
the regeneration of the world their
representatives are to be found in every
large center of population working
quietly unostentatiously teaching
preaching gaining an occasional re-
cruit ever content to bide their time
knowing that years are but seconds in
the general scheme of the universe
  mahommed gunga the master as
he was known to those who loved and
obeyed him was a truly wonderful
man taken when a child by the
holy ones his life had been dedicated
by them to the service of his fellow
creatures masters of mystery delv-
ing far beyond the comprehension of
ordinary humans into the phenomena
of life they had poured their combined
wisdom into his open ears and their
task completed they had sent him out
into the world as they had sent many
others before him to spread the propa-
ganda of the great work to which they
had pledged themselves
  none knew the limits of his power
none the depths of his great learning
to him all things were possible to
him lifes mysteries were but common-
places master of theosophy philoso-
phy and the sciences what to the no-
vitiate seemed to savor of the weird
the mysterious the occult was to his
mighty mind but the working of na-
tures laws
  it was to the shrine of the master
that des moines always journeyed
when confronted by a puzzle past his
comprehension for the clear reason-
ing power of the sage untangled riddles
which to the ordinary mind appeared
beyond solution
  so it was to the master that the in-
spector hurried as rapidly as his high-
powered car would carry him after the
broadway horror had shown him the
futility of his reasoning
ix
  he found the master walking in the
garden a faraway look in his soft
dreamy eyes in silent communion with
nature upon the policemans arrival
however his face lighted up and he
shook hands warmly for mohammed
gunga had none of the methods of the
charlatan to his friends his life was an
open book to be read by all who cared
to take the time
  greetings my friend he smiled
what new problem brings you here
this morning for i dare not hope
that so busy a man as yourself would
deign to make a purely social call come
walk beside me and tell me all about
it he laughed sadly as he continued
will you never remember my friend
that every atom has its master and rec-
ognizes his intelligence have we not
been taught to know that we have but
to seek the way by making the pro-
found obeisance of the soul to the
bright star that bums within
  des moines fell into step at his side
and hastily sketched the events of the
past thirty-six hours for mohammed
gunga did not keep in touch with the

the man who would not die
world newspapers never passed his
doorway
  when the inspector completed his
tale the master turned in his tracks
and placing his hands on the big mans
shoulders said in a voice that quivered
with emotion
  dear friend you have rendered the
cause a greater favor than you realize
by bringing your problem to me for
lessman in his egotism has at last un-
masked himself now we can fight
him in the open but i forget that you
do not understand sit here on this
bench with me and let me explain
  professor darius lessman is
without a doubt the greatest intellect
this or any other century has pro-
duced he was employed at one time
as teacher of psychology in a small in-
land college his great ability soon
brought him to the attention of the
holy men to whose cause we are all
devoted you know the lengths to
which they will go to further the
spreading of the great work they
sought him out he became the favor-
ite pupil of one in whose footsteps even
i am not fitted to walk he was tried
in various ways and found not want-
ing he was taught all-everything
his wonderful brain grasped in a few
years that which others have spent a
lifetime in learning so proficient did
he become that plans were made to
send him across the waters for final in-
struction from those the hem of whose
garments you and i may never hope to
touch
  the creator of all things never in-
tended that a man should have the
brain that was bestowed upon darius
lessman the man is an anomaly
the devil must have liad a hand in his
making and when his training was
completed took him for his own for
lessman crazed by the power he
found was within him conceived the
idea of living forever he believed
that he was greater than the god who
created him
  for months he practised in secret
attempting to transfer his soul from one
human body to another at the com-
mand of his will failing he sought
his old master told him his secret and
begged him for help when the mas-
ter turned upon him in horror and
loathing he killed the good old man to
protect his own devilish secret
  then he fled with a woman he had
captivated xby means of his diabolical
wiles-a pure girl named meta va-
netta who too had been an humble
pupil of the murdered master she be-
came lessmans tool-his accomplice
  together they worked out less-
mans plans in some secret place
spreading death and destruction wher-
ever they went in order to gain the hu-
man clay with which to work we have
followed them tracking them from
country to country yet seldom daring
to strike because of our knowledge
that he was our superior for lessman
is a monster-a man who laughs at
death and none has been found strong
enough to kill his twisted soul the
cell was never made that could hold
him for he has but to discard his
body and seize upon that of another
many men of our faith have met him
he has killed them all by the power of
his will
  the brain has not been made that
can match hisin a duel of wills even
i am fearful of him-and i am backed
by the united intelligence of the holy
men who are with me in spirit night
and day his is a mind gone wild-
amuck as you would say in the vernacu-
lar for years i have prepared myself
for the meeting am i fitted for the
ordeal 
  i tell you my friend the time has
come lessman must die we must
kill him for the sake of humanity not
as one man -dlls another we must
the man who would not die

 kill his soul even though we are forced
 to call upon the holy ones for aid
 for the time you-jnust forget that you
 are the policeman and become the pro-
 tector of mankind we must gird our-
 selves for the battle trusting in god to
 protect the right now do you under-
 stand
  des moines drew a trembling hand
across his brow from which the sweat
was pouring god he muttered
hoarsely its horrible-unbelievable
the master patted his shoulder af-
fectionately i realize it my friend
yet to a certain extent you have been
trained to see that which to the ordi-
nary mind appears obtuse multiply
that which you know and understand
by hundreds and you comprehend my
wisdom and i am but an infant in
intellect compared to darius lessman
   the man cares for but two things
-riches and power seek for the man
who would profit most by the death of
augustus winters and when you
have found him return to me further
than that i can tell you nothing i
must go now and in prayer and medi-
tation prepare myself for the inevita-
ble meeting
x
   inspector des moines left the home
of the master his head in a whirl al-
though his years of experience in grap-
pling with criminality in all of its sick-
ening forms had made him a man far
beyond the ordinary in point of intel-
lect his brain was too well acquainted
with the wonder-worker he had just
left to doubt his veracity
   he had seen the terrible power of
lessman in the case of the unfortunate
ryan the other officers who had battled
against the unseen force were unable to
add any information to what he already
knew they could only say that for the
instant a will more powerful than their
own had held them in check what it
was they could not explain nor could
they describe their sensations ponder-
ing over the matter as he whirled city-
wards the inspector could only shake his
head he was face to face with the
greatest mystery he had ever tackled-
a mystery so big that only the master
himself could fathom it
    as he came to a cross street he sud-
 denly changed his mind and directed the
 chauffeur to drive to the winters home
 he would again study the millionaire at
 close range he was unable to reconcile
 himself to the belief that the slow-witted
 hysterical man of money was the enor-
 mous intellect described by mohammed
 gunga yet everything fitted in to
 make a case against winters-only to
 tumble to pieces at the next turn
    there was the telephone call his men
 had investigated not only was the
 operator ready to swear that it had been
 winters who called from booth number
 fourteen but the cigar girl as well the
 man had stopped at the cigar stand for
 an instant he was well known to the
 girl in charge who had addressed him
 by name as had the clerk on duty at
 the time yet three minutes later win-
 ters had answered the telephone at his
 own home ten miles away clearly a
 man could not be in two places at the
 same time nor was it within the power
 of any human being by any modern
 means of transportation to transport
 himself that djstance within the time
 given
    wilkins answered the inspectors ring
 his master was in the parlor sitting be-
 side the body of his beloved wife he
 would announce the inspector
   a second later he returned and ush-
 ered des moines into the big reception
 jiall the inspector shook hands with
 the millionaire then his eyes on the
 others face he plunged immediately into
 the reason for his call
    mr winters he said i believe that
	the man who would not die
i am on the right track at last but i
need some information which only you
can give me will you do it
  there was no hesitancy on the part
of the man of wealth ask me anything
you wish inspector i will answer your
question to the best of my ability
  des moines bored on
  winters he said sharply who is
your heir
  the millionaire started
  why er-i dont understand what
you are getting at he exclaimed
  just this if i am correct in my guess
your life is in danger in view of this
mornings happenings i am at last firm-
ly convinced that mrs winters death
was nothing more or less than a cold-
blooded murder so too was the death
of the maid i will admit that several
times i have had my doubts now 
know
  winters started back aghast hor-
rible  horrible he cried it is hard
to believe-yet it must be true but
who could have so hated my poor wife
as to take her life
  the inspector continued relentlessly
with mrs winters out of the way it
is my belief that you will be the next to
go we must protect you now who is
going to profit by all this deviltry  have
you made a will 
  winters put his hand to his head
surely it cannot be true you cannot
believe that they-mere children-
who are they man speak up
my nephew thomas de pew and
my niece cora dayton his cousin
everything i have will go to them mrs
winters had no near relatives my will
has been made for months of course
had my wife lived she would have in-
herited all
  do they live in the city
  they make their home with me
they hjrve lived here since childhood
both are orphans
  i would like to talk with them ques-
tion them without their knowing the
reason will you kindly summon them 
tell them that i am merely seeking addi-
tional data for my report
   winters white-faced arose i will
do as you wish ihspector he said slow-
ly but you are wrong in suspecting
those children thomas is but nineteen
years of age his cousin is nearly a year
younger theirs cannot be the brains
that planned this horrible outrage
  he stepped into the adjoining room
only to reappear an instant later with
the information that both of the young
people had driven downtown for the af-
ternoon
   inspector des moines left the winters
home feeling that he had made no ma-
terial progress
xi
   the funeral services for the late mrs
winters had been held and the body ten-
derly laid away in the family vault in
rose hill cemetery at the same hour
in another part of the city amid more
humble surroundings was held the
funeral of dolly matthews the maid
  alone in his office inspector des
moines sat scanning the afternoon pa-
pers they were still filled with criti-
cisms of the police administration nor
did the inspector blame them greatly for
he was obliged to confess himself beaten
-defeated at every turn of the road he
had attended the funeral of mrs win-
ters in person several of his best plain
clothes men had mingled with the crowd
others had been present at the funeral
of the maid their reports were one and
the same there was nothing-absolute-
ly nothing-to report
   over the telephone he had given the
master the results of his interview with
winters mohammed gunga had ad-
vised him to say nothing do nothing un-
til lessman again showed his hand
lost in reverie he went over every
the man who would not die

phase of the case a stone wall con-
fronted him there was nothing upon
which he could even base a theory even
though he succeeded in pinning the
crimes on winters what jury would be-
lieve the incredible story there was
not even a motive he would be laughed
out of court mohammed gunga was
his only hope
   the telephone tinkled jarringly start-
 ling him out of his day dreams the
 voicewhich answered his gruff hello 
 was that of a stranger agitated jerky
   inspector this is thomas de pew
augustus winters nephew for the
love of god come out here quick some-
thing awful has happened
   i dont know what it is i cant ex-
 plain i only know that a stranger called
 here shortly after we returned from the
 funeral and inquired for my uncle wil-
 kins the butler heard him request a pri-
 vate interview uncle gus took him into
 his study and closed the door we sup-
 posed that he had departed for later
 my uncle left the house for a short stroll
 -or at least we so imagined
   a few minutes ago wilkins entered
the study he found the body of the
stranger lying on the floor-stone dead
no there is not a mark of violence 
him the physician-doctor bennett-
has just completed his examination
   and my uncle has not yet returned
xii
   over the telephone des moines re-
ported the latest angle of the case to mo-
hammed gunga then he drove to the
latters residence and picked him up on
his way to the winters home
   the white-faced butler admitted them
 trembling like a leaf as he ushered them
 into the presence of young de pew a
 slender youth trying hard to appear
 manly in spite of his agitation a mo-
 ment later they were joined by miss
 dayton the niece a beautiful girl whose
eyes were swollen and red from weep-
ing although she seemed to hold herself
under better control than did the boy
the inspector briefly introduced the
master as one of his men versed in
subtle poisons brought along for the
purpose of detecting if any such had
been used in making away with the
stranger found in the study
   a hasty examination of the dead man
proved the correctness of young de
pews report he was a rough appear-
ing individual evidently a laborer far
from the sort of person a man of win-
ters refinement and wealth would be
likely to be on intimate terms with
  mohammed gunga arose from the
stooping position over the dead man and
turned to de pew
   darius lessman he said in the con-
versational tone of one polished gentle-
man addressing another the time for
unmasking is at hand we meet at
last it is your soul or mine prepare
yourself for the ordeal summon if you
are able the powers of darkness i warn
you that behind me lies all of the great
strength of the holy ones-and only
you know what that means are you
ready for the trial
   for an instant there was silence
then with a wild shriek the girl ran
screaming from the room des moines
stepped back a pace startled by the sud-
den accusation yet he knew the master
too well to doubt the correctness of his
charges
  de pews eyes glared angrily he
seemed about to leap at the throat of his
accuser then with a shrug of his thin
shoulders he chuckled-a throaty dia-
bolical gleeful burst of mirth
  as you wish my dear mohammed
gunga as you wish i will warn you
as you have warned me i intend to kill
you damn you yes and the infernal
meddler with you too ill kill you as i
killed the others
   he rubbed his hands together glee-

the man who would not die
fully giving way again to his unholy
mirth yes and by god ill use your
carcasses as i used this piece of carrion
on the floor there think you that you
can stop me-that you in your little-
ness can end a career such as mine i
am lessman the man who can not
die ill be chief of police for a day
ha ha yes and ill wear the robes of
the master
  listen fools meta the woman i
love is she who has just left the room
together we killed mrs winters-
blasted her as we will blast you yes
ill blast you curse you i can throw
my will across the continent think
you then that you can defeat me i
got des moines here to end him know-
ing that he would bring you along
with you gone the world is mine
  in the body of mrs winters meta
left this house she came here in the
body of dolly ha ha it was a
puzzle for the fools of policemen try-
ing to figure out how the body of the
maid got into the coffin of the mistress
i love puzzles i worked it all out to
attract your attention-as i knew it
eventually would-my dear moham-
med gunga you were getting too
close to my tracks-you and your hell-
ish gang with you gone none will be
left on this side of the water who can
hope to match their strength with mine
   my only regret is that i didnt blast
that damned salesman johnson who
blocked our game when we stole the
brooch i was the chauffeur as you
have already guessed i grew tender-
hearted-fool that i am when he
seized meta he forced her to quit the
body she was occupying and enter that
of the dead woman we had in the ma-
chine ready for just such an emer-
gency ill get him yet though damn
him
   i killed winters inspector the same
night that i telephoned to you ha
it was funny i left his body hid-
den in a room i keep downtown for
just such purposes then i threw my
soul across the space and into the body
i now occupy in time to answer your
telephone call i knew that you would
trace the call and seek to trap me i
wanted to puzzle you it has been a
real pleasure for me to play with you
for i give you credit for having more
intelligence than the average detective
i knew that sooner or later though
you would get beyond your depth and
call for aid from mohammed gunga
  where is winters body hidden
now thats my business fools its
hidden away where i can use it again
if the occasion ever demands-after
meta and i get through using the win-
ters millions possibly your police-
man o yes i killed him-blasted
him from the automobile while i was
talking to you i kept my promise did
i	not
  and now both of you prepare to
die i lessman the man who will
not die will it
xiii
  des moines felt an icy sensation
creep over him then came a peculiar
numbness he struggled against it
clammy fingers seemed to dutch his
throat he was choking he stag-
gered like a drunken man seeking an
avenue of escape a veil of darkness
seemed to weigh upon his eyes tighter
and tighter grew the bands about him
and then screaming like an hysterical
woman he fell to the floor uncon-
scious
  how long he lay there he never
knew probably only a few seconds
he awakened suddenly for an instant
he imagined himself dead he opened
his eyes over him stood the master
calm self-reliant facing the monster
silently the two men only a few yards
apart waged the greatest battle the
from his body emanated a thin vapor-an aura it spread across the room like a
nauseous miasma-page 


the man who would not die
world will ever know-the battle of
wills-a duel between the powers of
darkness and the forces of good
  slowly - slowly - slowly lessman
seemed to weaken great drops of
sweat stood out on his forehead his
breath came in asthmatic pants he
struggled to save himself to concen-
trate his powerful will for a final ef-
fort but in vain opposed to him was
a will greater than his own-the united
will of the thousands who had devoted
their lives to the work of uplifting man-
kind-the will of the holy men of
india
  his legs trembled his fingers
twitched jerkily then as he sank to
the floor he made a final effort to es-
cape from his body emanated a thin
vapor-an aura it was his soul at-
tempting flight it spread across the
room like a nauseous miasma smoke-
like cloudy repellent-hellish
  in response to the masters will it
drew itself together slowly-oh so
slowly-as if fighting to the very last
it drew nearer and nearer to the man
to whose mind it acknowledged the
mastery
  at last it was but a tiny smoky
grey ball of vapor the master held
forth his hand and it hovered over his
palm he pressed his fingers together
when he opened them a tiny particle
of grayish power lay within his hand
  through the house rang the blood-
curdling shriek of a woman-a single
despairing wail of anguish then
through the door floated another
wraith for a second it hesitated
then it mingled with the ashes of its
lover in the masters hand
  mohammed gunga blew upon his
palm the powder vanished into noth-
ingness
  he extended his hand to des moines
and assisted him to his feet
  that is the end only you and i
know the truth let us depart the
monster is dead

the moment for which hankin-
son had made such anxious and
careful preparation during three
weary weeks of watching and
waiting had come at last there with-
in a yard of him was the old jeweler
whom he meant to stun and to rob
there in hankinsons hand was the
sandbag with which he intended to strike
him down and all about the two men
the one unsuspecting the other quiver-
ing with intent hung the heavy silence
of midnight broken only by the metal-
lic tinkle of the valuables which the old
man was slowly transferring from
counter to safe
  hankinson thief and criminal from
his youth upward had at that time been
out of prison for precisely a month he
had no particular desire to return to
prison but on the other hand he had
no leanings toward the path of recti-
tude
  upon emerging from durance he had
possessed himself of a small stock of
money which he had safely hidden in
view of emergencies when it was in his
pocket he had left his usual haunts in
north london and betaken himself to
new ones in the purlieus of the mile end
road he took a cheap lodging there
and began to look around him in white-
chapel and its neighborhood and in
time he saw what he considered to be a
good chance
  lurking about in the busy streets
always with alert eyes he saw at last a
prospect of replenishing the gradually
emptying purse thereafter he gave all
his thought and attention to that pros-
pect the prospect quickly became a
scheme
  there was an old-fashioned dingy
jewelers shop in a small side street off
houndsditch it was also a pawn-brok-
ing establishment three gilded balls
overhung a passage entrance at the side
in that passage there was a sort of
sentry-box in which the shutters of the
front window were kept a curly-
headed hooked-nose boy put up those
shutters every night before going home
he was utterly indifferent to the shut-
ters that boy when he had once put
them up but when he had gone away
whistling hankinson under cover of
the dusk took a mighty interest in them
for long years of trained observation
had made hankinsons eyes unusually
sharp and it had not taken him more
than one glance to see that in one of
those shutters there was a noticeable
an appreciable crack you could see the
light in the shop through it therefore
through it you could see into the shop
  hankinson contrived to see into the
shop through that slit a good many
times it was always at night that he
made these observations and he made
them with delicacy and with speed but
within a week he learnt a good deal
  much of what he learnt was obvious
in other ways-namely that the shop
was closed on saturdays all day long
that from monday to thursday it was
closed at nine oclock in the evening
that on friday nights it was kept open
until eleven but his observations
through the crack in the shutter in-
formed him that every night after clos-


the yellow dog
ing hours whether at nine oclock or at
eleven isidore marcovitch the old pro-
prietor a gray-haired stooping-figured
hebrew busied himself alone unaided
in transferring his most valuable wares
from his window and counter to a large
safe which stood in the rear of the shop
and dingy and old-fashioned as the
shop was there were valuables in it
which made hankinson covetous
  hankinson made his preparations
carefully
   first of all he convinced himself that
this hiding away of goods was a nightly
performance
  secondly he made sure that the old
man was always alone when the per-
formance was gone through
  thirdly he came to know that the
only other occupant of the house was a
girl-quite a young girl presumably
marcovitchs granddaughter-who ap-
peared to live in the upper regions
  hankinson formed the opinion-on
good grounds-that this young woman
retired to bed long before closing hours
on friday nights at any rate there was
a window in the very upper room in
which a light shone for a while every
night at half-past nine he grew to be
positively certain that beyond this girl
there was nobody on the premises save
marcovitch himself and that marcovitch
was the only waking thing in the house
when he put his goods in the safe on
friday evenings obviously then
friday was the day of excellent choice
  but hankinson did not content him-
self with outside observation only he
felt it necessary to see the inside of that
shop at close quarters therefore he
invented a good excuse for visiting it
twice-by taking something to mend
and calling for the mended article a
few days later on these occasions he
inspected this new hunting ground with
due care
  after the second inspection he told
himself that it was all right the big
safe in which old marcovitch stowed his
best things stood detached from the
wall between the wall and it there was
a space in which a man could easily be-
stow himself unnoticed the only dif-
ficulty was to secure an unobserved en-
trance to the shop for long vigilant
observation had shown hankinson that
when marcovitch was not behind his
counter the curly-headed boy invariably
was
  hankinson watched for his oppor-
tunity on two successive friday eve-
nings at ten minutes to eleven on the
second opportunity came for some
reason or other the old jeweler sent the
lad out of the shop a moment later
he himself quitted the counter and dis-
appeared into the rear premises and
thereupon hankinson slipped in and an
instant later had hidden himself between
the safe and the wall
  there were old coats and cloaks
dusty and musty hanging there and
they made good cover if marcovitch
when he came back had narrowly in-
spected these ancient garments he might
have found hankinsons nose protrud-
ing at one place and his feet at another
but marcovitch suspected nothing and
hankinson was well skilled in holding
his breath
  the usual routine of the establish-
ment went on placidly the curly-
headed boy presently put up the shut-
ters and went away pocketing his
wages marcovitch locked chained and
bolted his door he disappeared into
the pawn-broking part of his shop han-
kinson heard more bolting and barring
  then from some inner part of the
premises he heard the sound of a with-
drawn cork and a little gurgling and
splashing the old man said hankin-
son to himself was about to refresh
himself with a drink
  then came the scent of a strong
pungent cigar and presently marcovitch
returned into view a cigar in one cor-
the yellow dog

ner of his bearded lips a steaming tum-
bler in his hand an odor of rum
strong insidious penetrated to hankin-
son and overcame the musty smell of the
old garments because of his previous
vigils hankinson was well acquainted
with the accustomed routine
  old marcovitch began by unlocking
the safe then he took out certain
goods from the locked showcases on his
counter better things came from a
sort of wired-in enclosure which filled
the center of the window-an enclosure
of stout wire closely meshed and
clamped there were trays in that which
contained rings and necklaces and orna-
ments set with diamonds and pearls
some of these things were ticketed
some were not
  but hankinson having often glued
his nose to the thick plate-glass window
had a good idea that he could easily stow
away a few hundreds of pounds worth
of stuff out of those trays in one of his
pockets good stuff he said to himself
lies in little room
   it was hankinsons notion to hit mar-
covitch when the trays from the window
and the counter-cases had been laid on
the counter previous to transferring
them to the safe
  he had everything ready for the at-
tack the sandbag was already grasped
in his right hand in a left-hand pocket
he had a gag all ready to insert in the
old mans jaws in another pocket a
length of cord wherewith to secure mar-
covitchs wrists and the moment was
drawing near was almost there when
marcovitch turned from his trays to the
safe took out of a drawer a small
packet done up in brown paper with a
tissue-paper lining and with a low
chuckle of delight shook out on the
counter a quantity of loose diamonds
  hankinson grew hot and cold and
hot again as the light fell on those
sparkling stones
  here indeed was luckl such luck
     b	m-sept-
as he had never expected he was not
versed in the lore of precious stones but
he knew diamonds from paste and he
had no doubt that these sparkling things
were genuine products of the south
african diamond fields
  and there was pretty nearly a handful
of them they must be good for noth-
ing but the thought of their extreme
goodness would account for the self-
satisfied way in which the old jew
chuckled as he bent over them turning
their shining facets over with his claw-
like finger and-now was the time
  hankinson glided out of his cover
and brought the sandbag crashing down
on marcovitchs bald head
  marcovitch instinctively spasmodi-
cally threw up his hands he emitted
one groan reeled and was falling over
on his side when hankinson caught him
it was not part of hankinsons game
that marcovitch should fall heavily on
the floor he let the old man slide
gently down in two minutes he had
securely gagged him in two more min-
utes he had drawn his hands behind his
back and fastened his wrists together
  and it was as he rose from the ac-
complishment of these things that he
suddenly heard a strange sound-the
sound of something alive drawing in its
breath in a queer sniffling snuffling
fashion somewhere close at hand
  instantly hankinson recognized that
sound it was the sound made by an
imprisoned animal which snuffs at the
crack of its prison door
  lumme whispered hankinson to
himself a blinkin dawg
  he lost no time after that and as he
transferred the most valuable things to
his pockets-diamonds here gold there
-he wondered how it was that he had
never seen any dog about marcovitchs
premises
  presently the sniffling sound died
away all became quiet again and
without as much as a glance at the fallen

the yellow dog
man hankinson made round the coun-
ter to the door in his opinion the man
who has done his work effectually
should go away as soon as his job is
done but going he took care to turn
out the gas
  hankinson had manipulated the key
the chain and the bar and was about to
open the door in gingerly fashion when
he heard a sound at the rear of the
shop he turned muttering a curse a
door had noiselessly opened and there
holding a lamp above her head stood
marcovitchs granddaughter she was
in her nightgown her hair-long black
lustrous-fell far below her waist her
great eyes dilated with alarm shone like
stars and at her side nuzzling
against her knees was the strangest
ugliest-looking beast of a dog that han-
kinson had ever set eyes on
  it was queerly shaped it was of no
known breed it was a vile yellow in
color and it had only one eye it was
borne in upon hankinson amidst the
rush of thoughts which this new situa-
tion forced on his consciousness that he
would have bad dreams about that dog
and he cursed it without knowing that
he was even thinking of it
  there were other things to think of
just then hankinson realized his dan-
ger he made a sudden dash back at
the girl the girl set up a loud scream
dashed the lamp in his face drew back
with the agility of a snake and locked
the door behind her
  hankinson went too then he groped
his way to the street door and let him-
self out as he crossed the threshold
he had an unpleasant feeling of a sinu-
ous wiry body that cannoned against
his legs and he kicked out at it in sheer
frenzy of hatred but when he reached
the pavement and looked round him
there was no dog there and with an-
other oath he made off
  there was nobody about just at that
point but there were people twenty
yards away on either hand and hankin-
sons chief desire was to mingle with
and get beyond them he turned to the
right and sped swiftly away and just
then the jewess darted out into the
street from the side entrance and let out
a yell that startled every midnight
stroller within the eighth of a mile
  murder
  hankinson shot into the nearest entry
it was light where he entered it it was
black where he traversed it it was light
again where he left it and flinging a
glance over his shoulder as he turned
at the end of it he saw figures
dart after him also he heard a queer
padding sound not so far away from his
heels
 he knew then that hre was a
serious business and he set his teeth
and ran there was a network of al-
leys and courts and queer places there-
abouts
  hankinson dodged from one to the
other as a rabbit dodges about in its
warren when the ferrets are after it
but wherever he went he heard the
queer padding sound and he cursed
that one-eyed yellow dog to the depths
of a dogs hell
  and yet once twice thrice he
looked round-at least once with his re-
volver in his hand-and never saw any
dog at all not even when there were
patches of light which the pursuit brute
or human must cross
  eventually hankinson spent of
breath made two or three desperate
twistings and twinings and darted into a
dark court the next minute something
seemed to catch him by the ankle he
made a violent plunge forward dashed
his head against a wall saw thousands
of stars flash and coruscate before his
eyes and felt a great buzzing and hum-
ming rise up somewhere behind his ears
and immediately after that hankinson
for the time being felt and saw noth-
ing more 
the yellow dog

 ii
  when hankinson came back to con-
sciousness he gradually realized that he
was in surroundings of an undeniably
strange sort save for a dull aching in
his head occasionally varied by a sharp
stab of pain he was not uncomfortable
he was lying on something very soft
and warm his head was properly pil-
lowed  he felt that some hand had care-
fully tucked a covering around his
limbs
  he judged from these things that he
was not at any rate in the detention
cells of a police station experience had
taught him that in these places small
consideration was shown to visitors but
it was no use opening his eyes for he
was in a queer sort of darkness-not an
absolutely black darkness but a sort of
deep misty blue darkness in the midst
of which high above him was a faint
spot of ruby-colored light he could
make that out and he could tell that the
darkness was blue and not black more
than that it was impossible to say
  but if hankinsons eyes could do lit-
tle his nose was able to do more
  his nostrils began to expand and to
titillate under unfamiliar odors there
was a queer clinging permeating scent
all around and about a scent of saffron
and musk and sandalwood it was
heavy thick almost oppressive it made
him cough
  there had been an unearthly silence
about that place until then hankin-
sons cough sounded like the report of
a revolver let off in a vault and when
it died away and silence fell once more
hankinson heard the sniffling and snuf-
fling of a dog somewhere close by then
he remembered everything and a cold
sweat broke out all over him and at
that instant a flood of light was turned
on silently and hankinson blinking
upward saw standing at his side a gi-
gantic chinaman clad in the costume of
his own country who looked down
upon him with an expression which
would have sat well on the face of a
sphinx
  this extraordinary vision so fright-
ened hankinson that he immediately
closed his eyes and shut it out
  then he felt a cool hand laid on his
forehead and heard a voice speaking in
perfect english and soft mellifluous
tones
  how do you feel now asked the
voice
  hankinson made so bold as to open
his eyes again he took another a
longer look at the chinaman
  the oriental wore spectacles and it
was impossible to see his eyes clearly
but his tones were propitiating and
hankinsons spirits revived
  bloomin queer he answered he
tried to move and for some reason
found movement difficult  ow he
continued  ow did i come ere guv-
nor
  i carried you into my house said
the chinaman quietly i was taking
the air at my door when you darted past
me followed by a dog the dog sud-
denly caught you by the ankle and you
stumbled and fell and dashed your head
against the wall that he added lay-
ing a delicate fingertip on a lump of
wet lint which decorated hankinsons
right temple that is where your head
came into contact with something
harder it is well for you my friend
that your frontal bones are of more than
usual strength
  hankinson stared
  then he referred to the only part of
the speech which seemed to him to be
really pertinent
  that there dawg now he asked
anxiously wot about im guvnor
  the chinaman pointed to a door at
the foot of the couch on which hankin-
son was lying
  the dog he replied is safely be-

the yellow dog
stowed in there he followed us in-
and i took good care that he should not
go out he appears to be an animal of
undoubted sagacity
  hankinson moved again and again
found that movement was difficult if
not impossible
   im obliged to yer guvnor he said
i-ill be movin now if you aint got
no objections
  the chinaman shook his head
gravely
  not yet he said it will not be
well for you to move just yet let me
advise you to rest quietly where you
are
  an why demanded hankinson
suspiciously there aint nothink seri-
ous is there guvnor a crack on the
ed now-that aint nothink i got
business yer see an-
  and there are those who have busi-
ness with you remarked the chinaman
the police
  hankinson felt cold again but he
managed to look surprised
  perlice he exclaimed wot about
the perlice then i aint-
  the chinaman stretched out an arm
and pulled a small wheeled table from
behind hankinsons head he silently
directed hankinsons eyes to it
   eavens muttered hankinson
  the surface of the table was covered
with an array of objects pleasing enough
in themselves but not welcome to han-
kinson under present circumstances
these objects were laid out in order
neatly and systematically
  there was a row of gold watches
there was another row of gold chains-
good and solid there were pendants
ornaments bracelets-all of gold for
hankinson had scorned anything of less
value and there were precious stones
-some fine pearls some excellent
rubies-and in the center of everything
on a rag of blue velvet lay the dia-
monds over which the old jeweler had
chuckled also in one corner of the
table lay hankinsons revolver
  hankinson felt very sick as he
looked at these things yet-it was
about what he had expected and all
he could do was to glare resentfully at
the bland features of the spectacled face
  the chinaman however remained
unmoved
  that he said again indicating the
table will explain much if you wish
for further explanation-mr marco-
vitch is dead
  hankinson jumped-as much as that
curious inertia would permit
  garn he said in a low voice yer
dont mean it it cant be guvnor
wy i ony-
  he was quite dead when the police
entered his shop said the chinaman
you hit him too hard and perhaps
you are not very experienced in the use
of the gag however he is dead and
the police are in pursuit of you
hankinson began to whimper
yerve trapped me he whined
yer meanin to and me over yerd
a deal better ave let me lie where i was
an yerve done somethink to me an all
-i cant move
  that replied the chinaman is the
effect of a medicine with which i have
treated you rest awhile and the effect
will pass off i am not going to hand
you over to the police you are quite
safe-quite safe i repeat-so long as
you do what i tell you
  hankinson stared he was suspicious
as ever but there was a calm confident
assurance about the chinaman which
went far to allay suspicion and sud-
denly his eyes brightened and his voice
lost its whine and became almost cheery
  you see me right guvnor an ill
make it all right wiv you he said in-
sinuatingly  struth i adnt no in-
tentions o finishin the old man an
wotever you likes out o that little lot
its yours
the yellow dog

  the chinaman pushed the table out
of sight again
  we can discuss that matter later
on he said at present you must take
some food and after that you must sleep
until evening and then we will see about
getting you away
  hankinsons small eyes looked a sharp
inquiry
  strite he asked no fetchin the
perlice in while im-here
  you can trust me answered the
chinaman it would not suit me to
have police in my house i have my
own affairs
  that reassured hankinson he set
down his host as being one of his own
kidney and presently he ate the soup
-good rich soup with strength in it-
which the chinaman brought him and
after that he went to sleep quite
calmly   
ill
  when hankinson woke again there
were two chinamen in the room with
him one was the big man of the pre-
vious interview the other also garbed
in chinese dress was a younger man of
about his own size and weight-an
almond-eyed stolid-faced fellow who
was regarding hankinson with an in-
scrutable expression on his immobile
features the big man was talking to
the small one in gibberish which han-
kinson did not understand catching
sight of hankinsons opening eyes he
broke off the conversation
  you are quite better now he said
not quesdoningly but in positive as-
sertion you-now you may get
up there is food and drink ready
for you in the next room come this
way
  hankinson got up and stretched him-
self certainly he was all right then-
not a trace of injury remained in him
and with this realization of recovery a
desire for action came upon him he
wanted to be out of that instinctively
he looked round for the little table on
which his loot had been laid out but
the little table was not there
  in the next room said the big chi-
naman with a grin come
  hankinson followed the two men into
a plainly furnished apartment which
evidently did duty as living-room and
kitchen there was a table set out in
english fashion
  hankinson was motioned to seat him-
self the smaller chinaman sat down
in a comer and stared at him the big
one served him with hot roast fowl
  never had hankinson eaten such ten-
der food in his life and he gave him
bottled stout to drink it seemed to
hankinson that he had never tasted such
nectar he stuffed himself he guzzled
freely wondering all the time what it all
meant and when at last he could eat
and drink no longer he shoved away his
plate and looked his host full in the face
with half-impudent inquiry for han-
kinson was very sure that the big china-
man was not playing the good samari-
tan for nothing he would want his fee
like everybody else
  an now what guvnor asked
hankinson familiarly if its all the
same to you yer know i should like to
op it i dessay its all right but this
ere neighborhood aint what youd call
healthy is it now
  the big chinaman who had taken a
seat by his compatriot during the final
stages of hankinsons repast produced
an evening newspaper and laid it before
the guest
  his long tapering fingers indicated
bold headlines and other uncomfortable
things about midnight murder and bur-
glary hankinsons pale cheeks grew
paler as he read
  yer said as ow yer could get me
away he muttered at last an i
said as ow yer was welcome to what
the yellow dog

yer liked to take out o what i got-eh 
hows it to be guvnor
  i can get you away answered the
chinaman but-it will have to be out
of england
  out of-england exclaimed han-
kinson  struth  wy i aint never
been out of england i dont know no
lingo but english where would it be
now guvnor not-not to where you
come from would it cause i under-
stand thats a longish way off
  the big chinaman leaned forward as
if to attract strict attention
  now listen he said there is a
chinese ship in the river lying off wap-
ping which sails tonight for amster-
dam her captain will take you on
my recommendation to amsterdam
and in amsterdam you can sell your
-diamonds when you have sold your
diamonds you can take ship to
america-or wherever you please to
go
  hankinson silently ran over his in-
ventory of the stolen goods
  diamonds eh he said musingly
there fre other things than diamonds
yer know
  i have estimated the value of what
was on you said the chinaman gravely
the diamonds are worth about two
thousand pounds you will get one-third
of their value in amsterdam the other
things are worth about four or five hun-
dred pounds you can leave those with
me-my share
  done exclaimed hankinson but
how am i to get down to that there
ship he asked anxiously seems ter
me as ow therell be a pretty sharp
look-out for me guvnor an no error
hows it to be done
  the big chinaman motioned to the
smaller one
  this gentleman he said will lend
you some garments you will go down
dressed as a chinaman after dark i
will prepare you-make you up with a
little paint and other matters and we
will begin now-time presses
  hankinson cheerfully submitted to
the proposed transformation he
stripped to his underclothing he put
on chinese trousers and soft-soled chi-
nese boots he was fitted with upper
garments which amused him by their
strangeness and comforted him with
their silky feeling and then he sat
down and the big chinaman produced a
box of colored pigments and delicate
brushes and set to work on hankin-
sons head and face he worked with
the zest of a true artist and the other
chinaman stood by and admired with-
out moving a muscle of his features
  at the end of half an hour hankin-
son was bidden to look in a mirror and
he stood up and looked and stared it
did not amaze him that he did not know
himself what astonished him was that
the craftsmans cunning had trans-
formed him into the double of the other
chinaman the big man with a sly
smile had twisted his compatriot round
so that he stood side by side with han-
kinson facing the mirror-and hankin-
son gasped as he gazed at the two yel-
low faces
  gawd he said why-its im
  the big chinaman allowed himself to
laugh he put a few finishing touches
to his work adjusted the cap and false
pigtail finally produced a truly chinese
umbrella and then in short plain
fashion he gave hankinson his instruc-
tions he was to make his way to a
certain wharf in the neighborhood of
london docks there he would be met
by a boats crew and taken on board the
chinese vessel in his progress through
the streets he was to preserve a sober
grave demeanor-above everything he
was not to hold converse with anyone
especially a policeman if anybody ac-
costed him he was to smile blandly and
shake his head
  right guvnor said hankinson

the yellow dog

im on-mums the word now them
shiners 
  the big man produced a small bag
open at the mouth within it hankin-
son saw gleams of sparkling fire he
made haste to stow it away in the pocket
wherein he had already put his money
then he gave the big man a firm look
  theres another thing he said im
goin into strange parts and amongst
strange folks and i aint a-goin wivout
my revolver hand it over guvnor
as it was mind
  the chinaman produced the revolver
showed hankinson that it was fully
loaded and calmly dropped it into his
own pocket
  i will hand that to you in the street
he said i am going to walk a little
way with you now let us go
  and he led hankinson out of the
house into-the night as they passed
out the younger chinaman hastened to
a window which commanded the way by
which they went he saw them pass in
and out of the lights of the lamps-and
suddenly he saw a couple of vague
shadowy figures emerge from a dark
place and steal after them in his eag-
erness and excitement to see that part of
the proceedings he threw up the sash
of the window and leaned out and in
that instant the yellow dog which had
been tied up in that room completed its
days task of eating through the stout
cord that had prisoned it the young
chinaman leaning through the window
was conscious for a second of a sinuous
body hurling itself past him before he
had time to comprehend matters he saw
that body vanishing round the corner
he shut the window then and retired to
resume his usual sphinx-like demeanor
  presently the big man came back and
grinned at his compatriot
  they are after him he said briefly
  i saw them replied the other
  the big man grinned again
  it is fortunate that this fellow fell
at my door he said he has served
us well certainly he will never fall
there again we benefit very well we
have what he brought in-and he has
some worthless bits of paste it is
good i
  the younger man made no answer to
this nor did he mention that the dog
had escaped
  it is time that i go now he ob-
served
  and without further remark he pro-
ceeded to divest himself of his oriental
garments and to put on the inconspicu-
ous suit of grey tweed which hankin-
son had recently taken off
iv
  ten minutes later a figure dressed in
hankinsons clothes much muffled
about the neck and face and having
hankinsons cap pulled down over its
nose slipped out of that quiet house and
went away by devious paths to other and
safer parts no figure followed it the
two figures that had lurked in waiting
for it since dark were following hankin-
son
  and hankinson went on knowing
nothing he was beginning to feel him-
self safe and he did not care how much
people stared at him as he walked in
the glare of the gas he had what he
believed to be diamonds in his pocket
it had never even occurred to him that
the big chinaman might or would sub-
stitute paste for the genuine article he
had a prospect of selling them to advan-
tage and he had his revolver there-
fore being a bit of an actor he went on-
ward always smiling blandly
  hankinson knew the nearest way to
the wharf of which the big chinaman
had spoken and it took him little time
to get down there all his thoughts
were of his own business and he had
no idea that two yellow-faced slit-eyed
fellows clad in slop suits of blue serge

the yellow dog
were dogging his every footstep nor
did he know that an ugly uncanny-look-
ing one-eyed mongrel was slinking
behind him keeping close to walls and
to the fronts of shops jhat one eye
perpetually fixed on its object of
pursuit
  hankinson never saw that dog until
he had walked on to the wharf-a de-
serted desolate cold expanse of timber
on which there was no business doing at
that hour of the evening there was a
pale gleam of yellow from the window
of a waterside inn at the other end of
the wharf a half-moon was far up in
the cloudy sky here and there a faint
gas flame burned in this poor light
hankinson suddenly saw the yellow
dogs one eye-baleful malevolent it
turned him hot and cold and he could
do nothing but stare at it
  he saw nothing of a boat putting off
from any vessel thereabouts indeed
nothing of any sort seemed to be doing
there was in fact no sign of life on
the wharf but in his own and the dogs
presence and the dog had sat down
now and did nothing but watch him
when the clouds cleared off the moon
hankinson saw the dogs one eye-and
he cursed it under his breath in plain
cockney english
  it was in the midst of these mutter-
ing curses that the two slinking figures
suddenly leapt out on hankinson as he
passed the stack of timber there was
a flashing of steel in the moonlight and
two knives went swiftly in and out of
the soft silks in which hankinson was
masquerading he fell over on his back
as the knives were withdrawn and con-
vulsively twisted up and on to his side
he knew that blood was running from
him like the spurts from a suddenly
pricked wineskin but his brain was clear
enough yet and he mechanically
snatched at his revolver and fired left
and right at the two figures which were
drawing back from him and as his
own eyes began to glaze he saw the two
figures sway and fall-fall in the unmis-
takable fashion
  lor gasped hankinson as his
head dropped got-em-both
  then hankinson died and the yellow
dog came near and looked at him
  when you find the bodies of three
dead men lying in the moonlight on a
thames-side wharf one of them an
englishman dressed in chinese garb
two of them chinese men attired in
reach-me-down slop suits the english-
man stabbed the chinese shot the eng-
lishman with a collection of paste dia-
monds on him the chinese with next to
nothing and all three watched by a
miserable one-eyed yellow dog you have
all the elements of a first-class mystery
there were two orientals in different
places who could have solved that mys-
tery but your true oriental knows how
to keep a still tongue and the yellow
dog unfortunately was unable to make
humans comprehend him
bulling the bulls
      by walter scott story
i
young ryan looked down the
worcester platform through
the canyon formed by the mail
and express cars catching
the desired final signal he passed the
word to his chief carruthers
  carruthers unthrottled the giant
at his command and the long heavy
boston express got under way with
a deep and mighty puffing of the en-
gine the dull grind of its reluctant
wheels the clank of trucks and the
clink-clank of the couplings as each
preceding coach began to move and
communicated motion to the follow-
ing
   as the train gathered way rapidly
-fifteen minutes behind schedule on
its way to boston-a tall man in a
dark blue suit emerged from some-
where among the clutter of trunks
and crates and bales and running
alongside of the smoking car grasped
the rail of the end of the car and
after a few paces swung himself
aboard going swiftly up the steps
and entering the coach
   he passed up the car looking from
left to right the car was exceeding-
ly crowded some men sitting on the
arm rests of the seats and even then
in the middle of the afternoon it was
almost dusky because of tobacco
smoke
  the tall man went up the car
slowly but saw no vacant seat there
were two or three groups of card
players but notwithstanding this
all the seats seemed to be taken
  the traveler who had made the
train by the skin of his teeth as the
saying is passed the groups of
players and went on
  the fourth seat from the front of
the coach on the right-hand side was
occupied by but one person-a stout
sleek prosperous-looking man of
fifty or thereabouts dressed in a neat
gray suit and wearing a mouse-
colored fedora at this seat the tall
man halted
  seat engaged he asked
  the other man looked up and
smiled slightly in good humor he
had a merry but very keen blue eye
and his face had a healthy glow of
red and tan-the face of an outdoor
man or of a business man who is
faithful to his golf he shook his
head and moved in a trifle farther
toward the window
  the tall man sat down and relaxed
leaning his trim broad shoulders
back against the seat he was a fine-
looking man between thirty-five and
forty with a hawk-like yet boyish
face after a covert scrutiny of his
seatmate from deep-set keen dark
eyes he drew down his felt hat
somewhat over his forehead and
seemed to compose himself for a nap
  while he sat in this position with
his eyes closed the stout man looked
him over studying his face and
clothes-apparently puzzled the
tall athletic man was neatly dressed
but somehow or other he seemed to
give his clothes distinction and
seemed not to get from the clothes
the setting proper for such a trim
handsome fellow
  the forward door of the coach


bulling the bulls
opened and the conductor spectacles
perched on the top of his nose came
in followed by an assistant
  when the door opened durkee
the tall man opened his eyes and
began leisurely to reach into his
pockets for ticket or money from
the first pocket his hand came out
empty and an odd expression came
across his face he sat upright and
hastily but without flurry searched
for the necessary tender presently
he gave a shrug of the shoulders and
sat back he was a man of the world
-that was clear-but notwithstand-
ing he was mentally squirming as
the conductor a grizzled-haired man
with a stiletto eye and a very short
but polite tongue collected from one
man and then another
  durkee gave an inaudible breath
of embarrassment and vexation as
the official at length stood next to
him actually touching him as he
leaned over to give a mere glance at
the stout mans punched slip tucked
in the hold in the seat ahead
  ticket sir said the conductor
durkee looked up a slight smile
on his dark handsome face
  i came away in a hurry he said
and i havent a red cent on me as
far as i can find
  there was just a moment of si-
lence and durkee felt that embar-
rassment which any man no matter
how practiced a traveler he may be
feels when he is without funds and
left to the mercy of a man who daily
has to judge between humbugs and
innocents
  we stop at framingham sir im
sorry but-
  beg pardon interposed the stout
man turning to durkee with a smile
where you going
  boston answered durkee
whats the tax doctor in-
quired the stout man blandly
  the conductor named the price
and prepared a rebate slip and passed
it to the stout man when he had paid
durkees fare
  i havent even my watch on
said durkee when the conductor had
passed on im very much obliged
to you
  dont mention it my friend ive
been in similar predicaments
  they conversed for a little while
on general topics of the time-cau-
tious on the subject of politics-but
presently lapsed into silence and rode
on for ten or fifteen minutes without
speaking
  live in boston asked grant
breaking the silence
  no returned durkee his tone
was not of rebuff but he volunteered
no information about himself by
the way he said at length if
youll give me your name and address
ill send you my fare
  mr grant waved his hand and
uttered a little laugh
  thats all right he said
  its not all right declared the
other mildly emphatic theres no
reason why you should pay my fare
  mr grant half turned and looked
his seatmate over with a marvelously
quick glance
  if thats the way you feel about
it mister he said slowly it may
be you can do a little bit of a favor
for me
  durkee in his turn eyed his seat-
mate again in a furtive manner his
deep-set sharp eye missing nothing
a little curve appeared at the cor-
ners of his mouth-but went quickly
away
  the fact is im in a mean little
fix said grant i suppose i can
rest in confidence upon your word of
secrecy if you dont care to help me
  yes-if i pass my word re-
sponded durkee
bulling the bulls

  and do you pass the word 
asked the other quickly
  yes
  well this is the case maybe
youve heard of the pelton bank rob-
bery a few days ago
  no said durkee dont recall
hearing about it
  the stout man looked surprised
seemed about to say something then
apparently changed his line of
thought and speech
  well there was one there and
they say the robbers got away with
about-i think about twenty thou-
sand or something like that there
was a lot of talk about some of the
town police being mixed up in the
business and some of the-er officers
are in a peck of trouble over it
  all news to me asserted the tall
man carelessly
  the truth is mister im one of
the officers there in pelton and
definite charges have been made
against me in fact confidentially i
was to be arrested and im on my
way to boston to see some friends-
high-up fellows who can do ihings
see
  yes
  as i say the fellows are out to
get me-its a frame-up back there
you see-and i got a feeling that i
may be pinched in the south station
now you can see-any man of good
sense knows how these things go-
that if i dont get to my friends first
ill be in a pretty pickle thatd be
a trump play against me i dont
want to be caught in boston and side-
tracked and have it come out in the
boston papers and copied at home
i dont blame you commented
durkee looking at the other from
the corner of his eye a thrill run-
ning through him
  no i dont think anybody can
blame me said grant-anybody
who knows about politics now the
idea that came to me was this-that
you and i put on a pair of handcuffs
and give those fellows the slip in the
station just as if you were taking
me down get the idea
  yes buti dont carry such ar-
ticles with me-not as a rule re-
sponded durkee with a grin
  well i always do of course do
you think you could help me through
the crowd taking the part of an of-
ficer conducting me to the authori-
ties
  durkee smiled looking at the other
covertly with a queer light back in
his keen eyes
  suppose i cant bluff the thing
through my friend if youre right
and someones waiting for you-
what then
  grant turned and looked squarely
at him for an instant
  during that instant all the humor
was absent from his blue eyes in
its place a hard very hard look
  then he laughed shortly that odd
gleam disappearing
  why he said at length ill re-
lease you and do the best i can
they might hold me under the
circumstances couldnt blame them
much its pretty risky mister i
should say
  grant looked out of the window
for a few moments and then turned
back to the other failing to see the
look of satisfaction or triumph-or
whatever it was-that passed over
durkees face
  i shall be glad to give you say
fifty dollars young man i mean of
course this in addition to your fare
he supplemented jokingly
  i dont see that it can do much
harm anyway remarked durkee
rather carelessly the only danger
is that they might make things un-
pleasant for me

bulling the bulls
  oh ill see that you dont get in
wrong anyway
  well then ill try to help you
out promised durkee got em
  after a careful glance about grant
produced a pair of handcuffs he
clicked one hold on his left wrist and
then durkee after a slight hesita-
tion linked his thin sinewy long-
fingered hand to the others
  in this fashion they rode the rest
of the way to boston avoiding the
subject which linked them together
and chatting casually on various
matters of interest to ordinary citi-
zens
ii
  the express stopped at hunting-
ton station a few people got
off and a few got on two broad-
shouldered keen-eyed men obviously
together came into the smoking-car
by way of the forward door and came
down looking from left to right
they noted grant and durkee and
the bond that held them and with-
out comment passed on swiftly but
in a very business-like way
 no one i know announced
grant as the two went on after the
first glance
  he spoke in a matter-of-fact way
but durkee perceived that he was
really much relieved
 the train got under way after a
very short stop and sped on finally
coming to journeys end under the
mammoth shed of south station
 durkee and grant descended
promptly from the smoker and
went up to the shed with the
crowd the tide of people con-
verged and narrowed as it ap-
proached the gate of the shed and
passing through the entrance spread
out into the open space and began
immediately to lose its entity among
the throng scurrying here and there
in every direction
 as durkee and grant passed
through the gateway and bore off to
the left neither hurrying nor lag-
ging a burly ruddy-faced man in
dark clothes came from the fence-
noting them as soon as they issued
from the shed
  well well-hello kelly he said
mockingly jovial but with an under-
note of real and intense satisfaction
and as he gave the greeting he
grasped mr grant by the arm ap-
parently ready for trouble as if he
knew something about the peculiar
light that could shine in the others
eyes
  at the same moment he noticed
durkee and the bond between him
and the stout man he addressed as
kelly he lifted his eyebrows in
surprise and favored durkee with a
steady and half-hostile look
  as this man accosted and touched
grant another big man of the same
cut approached from another direc-
tion and joined the trio a little grin
coming to his face as he saw grant
  hello kelly said this new-
comer speaking very much as the
other stranger had spoken at last
  hello moran returned mr
grant with composure
  excuse me gentlemen put in
durkee promptly and courteously
but its hands off for you noth-
ing doing at all i got kelly for the
first national break in portland two
years ago lighted on him in
worcester by accident sorry-a
tantalizing slight grin came on his
hawk-like face-but you can come
up and have him in just about twelve
years
  the first burly man drew back a
pace scowling then he shrugged
his broad shoulders resignedly and
used strong language feelingly
bulling the bulls

  kelly for his part shot a quick
glance at the man whose fare he had
paid his blue eyes like rapier points
but after that look he glanced at the
disappointed boston men and
laughed at them
  tough luck boys said durkee
but you can have him when were
through come on old bird
  he gave kelly a slight tug and
kelly grinning queerly they walked
elbow to elbow through the throng
and out of the station
  durkee secured a taxicab and hav-
ing given his direction-north sta-
tion-entered the designated cab
with his captive
  when they were in the vehicle
durkee pulled the curtain on his
side half way down kelly following
suit at his request
  well ill be confounded ex-
claimed kelly as they crossed the
tracks and went into atlantic ave-
nue you got a quick wit my
friend
  he looked steadily at his com-
panion through half-closed lids
producing a key he reached over to
insert it
  as his right hand came down dur-
kees left hand with long sinewy fin-
gers closed over it with a grip of
steel and suddenly twisted the key
from the others possession
  kelly protruding his head belli-
cosely glared at durkee his eyes
now green and glinting and durkee
met his glare with a dancing light in
his eyes
  come across now kelly said
durkee coolly a grin coming to his
face
  so youre the real thing are you
exclaimed kelly with a vicious
sneer-a real bull eh walked
right into you didnt i funny too
cause i had a feeling before we got
to boston that there was something
off about you well well he
spoke evenly and smoothly now and
settled back a little
  durkee held his free hand to the
window and kept his eye upon the
other man
  dont you pull that gun kelly
he said quietly in a quick warning
or ill drop the key and smash you
and come across
  thats your game eh
  that-or delivery in portland i
knew you were kelly two minutes af-
ter we began to talk
  how much -a hundred 
durkee laughed mirthlessly and
dexterously released his right hand
from the cuff and slipped the key in
his pocket
  all you got on you now he an-
swered sitting tense like a coiled
spring
  as he spoke kelly-having hesi-
tated just long enough to let durkee
free his hand although noting his
action-drew back with a jerk and
at the instant he drew back his hand
whipping behind durkee fell upon
him like a bolt of lightning
ill
  kelly was a hard man and a
fighter but the younger man trim
and lithe was a tiger and in less than
two minutes he had him half throt-
tled and had his right hand in the
hold of the cuff he himself had worn
  he took kellys automatic from
the hip pocket and placed it upon his
own person and then ruthlessly
bearing the stubborn undaunted
bank robber down made an exceed-
ingly rich haul from various parts of
kellys clothes-thousands of dollars
in notes of large denominations-all
of which he placed in his own pock-
ets despite the others vicious strug-
gling

bulling the bulls
  as soon as he had convinced him-
self that he had taken all the money
kelly had durkee signaled the taxi
chauffeur to stop and when the car
had come to a standstill at the curb
he opened the door and stepped out
into the late afternoon sunshine and
the atmosphere of fish and dirty wa-
ter
  kelly said he with a grin ill
give the key to his nibs here and tell
him to unlock you at the north sta-
tion from there you may go any-
where you please
  who the blazes are you any-
way demanded kelly after deliv-
ering a volley of vituperation-the
only effect of which was to make the
other mans grin broaden
  see here kelly said durkee
calmly making no response to the
question you havent any kick com-
ing i got you through the line all
right saved you from a lot of trouble
and i know you got a lot of stuff
somewhere i kept my word not to
squeal and you can afford to pay
so quit your growling
  well who are you
  really like to know
  yes returned kelly with a sav-
age almost frenzied growl
  well said durkee smoothly
with great gravity-mock maddening
gravity-ill tell if you think it will
make you feel better my name is
ricker h tucker in real life by
profession i am like you yourself-
a bank robber but an unfortunate
one mediocre and until two days
ago i was incarcerated in a new
hampshire retreat i had just
worked down to worcester and
there as you know fortune brought
me face to face side by side with the
master of our craft-aloysius kelly
-fortune at the same time giving me
an opportunity to run the boston
lookout and to fill an empty pocket
i	admire you kelly-i take off my
hat to you-the tall eagle-faced ras-
cal who had indulged himself in the
luxury of several truthful statements
took off his hat with an ironical bow
-and as one who has done time i
admiringly admit that youre the
better man and-i thank you
  durkee slammed the door gave
the handcuff key to the chauffeur
and told him to drive to north sta-
tion and there release kelly he was
sport enough to pay for the ride too
-with a bit to spare
  as the cab darted from the curb
with the frantic kelly he looked af-
ter it for a moment with a smile
then turning walked swiftly back in
the way he had come
  that same night mr durkee sat
smoking contentedly on the deck of a
barkentine passing the graves en
route for rio de janeiro he was
thinking of the stout man whom he
had helped as desired-the king of
bank robbers who had never served
a sentence whose reputation he him-
self had that day saved-but was not
worrying about him or his welfare
it was natural that he should think
of him for he had secured from
brother kelly the snug sum of
 plus but mostly he was let-
ting his mind dwell virtuously upon
reform under comfortable conditions
upon a life of strict obedience to the
law-at least while the money lasted

  if you are not strong or well you owe it to
yourself to make the following test see how long
you can work or how far you can walk without
becoming tired next take two five-grain tablets
of nuxated iron three times per day after meals
or two weeks then test your strength again and
see for yourself how much you have gained many

because he knew the secret of great strength and
endurance which comes from having plenty of iron
