the men are jealous

     we thought we had an excellent idea - and so we did but there was a
flaw in it we offered one thousand five hundred dollars for prizes to
wearers of the sorosis shoe for the best fifteen stories illustrating the
romance that naturally accompanies the beauty style and comfort of the
sorosis shoe as worn everywhere that fair women and brave men meet -on
golf-links tennis-courts in mountain rambles ball-rooms and busy streets
at home and abroad so far so good but our mail came in and then the
trouble began

     the men were jealous they were not  wearers of the sorosis shoe
but claim they are quicker to notice and better able to appreciate handsome
shoes than their sisters that they knew all about the romance and beauty
and style and comfort of the sorosis shoe on the feet of their sweethearts
wives daughters sisters cousins and aunts and they wanted to write about
it - and incidentally to win the prizes they complained vigorously

     what could we do

     nothing -except apologize publicly and give them a fair chance with
the fairer sex

     but we dont intend to have the women put into competition with tom
dick and harry we stand by our original offer and for thomas richard
and henry we make a new offer - open to their sex alone

      there is nothing mean about the  sorosis  shoe or its manufacturers
and well prove it here is the proof

      for the best thirty stories illustrating the beauty style and comfort
of the

a e little  co  blake street lynn mass

manufacturers of the wonderful  sorosis shoe now so universally worn by women

       every applicant will receive a copy of our new college story containing fine half-tone
illustrations of all the prominent colleges

       note - the knowing one is now aware that  sorosis  make her feet look well and feel
well no matter what the size she wears

shoe

we offer

in prizes as follows

to women fifteen prizes

 for first-prize story  for second-prize story
and the rest  in smaller prizes

to men fifteen prizes of the same amounts

literary people of recognized standing and ability will be the judges of
these stories send for full particulars respecting this competition to

a postal card tragedy

by e f bishop

o	doubt sir rowland hill foresaw much of the
enormous increase of correspondence which his
great penny postage reform was sure to cause
and he survived to witness a great part of it in
his own country and indeed even lived to see
the post card and to know of the introduction
of its american cousin the postal card into the united states

  hut even his sanguine mind could not have conceived of the
extravagant fashion in which the postals were welcomed by
americans to whom they doubly recommended themselves by
their convenience and novelty in the early seventies thousands
were bought and sent by everybody to anybody - about any-
thing it was an amusement so fascinating and inexpensive that
the young fairly revelled in it

  george reade was a member of a junior class in a well-known
boysschool in which the craze had an extensive run the
boys bought them by the pack and showered them upon relatives
friends and acquaintances and finally upon entire strangers the
newspapers told of one ingenious writer who succeeded in having

a postal card tragedy

a card sent round the world and returned to him-a performance
which the postal regulations now forbid - and young reades
schoolmates emulated the achievement but without success
then they began to write absurd messages to creatures of their
imagination no replies were expected qr received but the boyb
delighted in showing each other these foolish productions and
chuckling over imaginary annoyances of rural postmasters in re-
mote regions in endeavoring to find claimants for u postals  that
never would be called for

  the specialty which george iieade had determined to master
was mineralogy with a view to ultimate mining and of course
an eventual fortune the waste places on the maps in his atlas -
those marked  unknown  and  unexplored  - had for him an es-
pecial attraction and any large district in the great west where
few towns were marked his fancy readily filled with auriferous
ledges inother-lodes and el dorado pockets maps of northwest-
ern states he found particularly interesting so much of them was
blank in those days save for a few devious streams and a host of
little lakes mostly unnamed in the northern half of one state
there was scarcely a post-office indicated this was before reade
had heard of star routes but he had just familiarized himself
with the postal card and felt that here would be a grand way to
stimulate the postal service and call the attention of the authori-
ties to the needs of a slighted section for he was convinced that
there must be some inhabitants in such a great stretch of country

  accordingly he determined to bring to the attention of the
post-office department the lack of facilities in this neglected re-
gion directly in the centre of the emptiest portion of the map
he found a long narrow winding lake named u vermilion no
settlement appeared anywhere within scores of miles but of course
there ought to be a settlement - with a post-office - in such an
eligible site and naturally it should take its name from the lake
so reade sat down and carefully addressed a postal as follows

john w watson        
 vermilion lake       
sheridan county       
   minnesota u  a 

a postal card tragedy



  why lie wrote watson at all -much less john w - lie did not
know then and does not know now he never knew personally a
watson and never has to this day but telepathy antedates
wireless telegraphy however reade was seeking for no expla-
nation occult or otherwise of this choice of a name but was in-
tent only at the time on the composition of his missive to the un-
known watson which finally took this form

tilton hall albany n y june  

my dear watson

   dont forget your promise to find a good vein for me i shall reach your place iu the
spring of  with tools powder and provisions have boats ready for me

your true friend	george a reade

  young reades mind was full of mines and mining and know-
ing nothing to the contrary he assumed all the rocks in the region
selected to be metalliferous so he gloated over the puzzle which
he supposed this absurd card would afford to numerous postal
clerks and postmasters not imagining that they would read noth-
ing but the addressed side he was educated of course above
the grade of those who address acquaintance and stranger alike as

  friend and he could not have told why he employed that form
unless it were an unconscious assumption of the inferior social
rank of his mythical correspondent however reade dropped his
card the last of the kind he ever wrote in the nearest mail box
and soon forgot all about it

  in  he had completed his course in this preparatory school
and entered a scientific institution from which he was graduated
in due course as a mining engineer the first position he ob-
tained was not a particularly promising one but lie was soon sent
west on a fair salary and now fully embarked on a career in
which practice speedily displaced theory he was here there and
everywhere among western mining camps

  in june  george reade arrived in denver and found
there awaiting him a quantity of mail matter including a letter
from his mother enclosing a postal card addressed to him at
albany forwarded by the principal of his old preparatory school
it read

vermilion lake may  

dear george

   thelce is gone out of the lake some time why aint you come yet i have everythinn all-
ready come quick bring powder and grub plees hurry up

             your friend	j w watson


a postal card tragedy

  reade was mystified he read the card twice looked at the
address again saw that it surely was directed to him and finally
threw it into the waste basket being unable to decide whether it
was sirapjy a mistake or a joke

  two or three weeks later his mother enclosed him a second pos-
tal card in the same hand sis the first it said 

   for gods sake come boou if you dout some of these fellers may jump it and i am stone
broke i tell you the show is a good one aud nobody is on to it but me

                      your friend	john

  u well thought reade this is odd in vain he cudgelled
his memory he knew no one of the name of watson had no
familiar friend john and had made no agreement to go any-
where with anybody so he threw his second card away

  ten days later came a third card enclosed in an enquiry from
reades mother as to what it all meant the third card ran as
follows

   if you dout come why dont you rite be you sick i tell you this wont keep much longer
and the winter comes early here

  this was too much for reade the distress of the writer
seemed so genuine that he couldnt help feeling sorry for him and
yet he disliked veiy much being troubled with the lamentations of
this unknown jeremiah  where is vermilion lake anyhow
he wondered as with cross words he tore up the puzzling commu-
nication

  by this time midsummer had arrived and george went east on
a vacation well pleased with his western successes and eager to
talk again with family and friends among the latter were two
or three schoolmates and they recalled old times with almost boy-
ish interest as he lit his pipe one evening one of them suddenly
exclaimed

   do you remember our postal card craze   believe  wrote
cards to bismarck and the kin of siam what a funny freak
it was 

   yes replied george  it seemed so ridiculously cheap in
those days to send the equivalent of a letter - stamp stationery
and all - for a single cent but i remember i always wrote my
bogus epistles in the innocent supposition that they would be
eagerly read by every postal employee who handled them what
kids we were  n
a postal card tragedy



  but when his friends had gone reades mind continued to
dwell on this particular phase of boyhoods freaks and in think-
ing of postal cards he could not dismiss from recollection his
mysterious correspondent watson and the desire to know the
location of vermilion lake grew upon him taking down a
gazetteer he found that there were a number of vermilion lakes
but that he had never been near any of them obviously he
thought he was not the reade wanted by somebody somewhere
and so he shut the book and went to bed

  the next morning one of georges sisters brought in the mail
it contained still another card from  watson directed this time
to his home and not as the previous ones had been to the school
the writer said

   why didnb you write me you had moved mebbe you dldut get my other letters i am
getting pretty low in grub so hnrry up the boys all think i am crazey writing for you to
come be quick and fetch lots of grub i have the vein alright

                         your friend	t w watson

  reades puzzle was renewed he could make nothing of it
he had seen from the first that his correspondent was uneducated
but now when i studied the shaky writing it occurred to him
that its sinuosities might be the result of the tremor of age he
regretted that he had not answered one of the previous cards
addressing it at random to vermilion lake as a line would suffice
to inform watson that his communications were going to the
wrong reade he resolved to write that very day but forgot it
altogether in some diversions planned by his sisters and the mat-
ter did not surmount the threshold of consciousness again till he
had returned to the west and the mail from home brought him a
reminder in this shape

   for gods sake what is the matter why dont you come i am starving and you promised
yon would come last spring sure if you dont come soon it will be to late i cant hang on
alone much longer minnesoty winters begin early

  here was a practical hint which reade now lost  time in fol-
lowing up ho wrote at once to vermilion lake minnesota -
not on a postal card - informing watson that he had received a
number of cards from him evidently intended for some other
reade and regretting that he had not been able to notify him
sooner this salved his conscience and he supposed he had


a postal cakl tragedy

heard the last of his unknown correspondent but not long after-
ward he received the following

dear gorge

   not much i aint made no mutake didnt you rite me in  you would be here iu the
spring of i have waited to long now winter is not far off bring nix month grub i am
half ded	your frend

                                       j w watson

  this was really astounding and reade could not get the matter
out of his head day or night who could this mysterious wat-
son be and why was he afflicted with his disappointments pro-
curing a postal guide george found that there actually was a
vermilion lake minnesota and going to a map he looked up its
exact location while doing so his mind half-consciously reverted
to his recent conversation with his schoolmates and traveled back
to the days they had recalled and in a flash the resurrection of a
long dormant memory came a recollection of that last boyish
postal card written to some imaginary person ten years before
and he realized that he was the right george a reade to whom
all those puzzling cards had been written what an absurd
thoughtless prank it had leen and now it had resulted in causing
trouble and apparently actual suffering to a fellow-being of
whose very existence he had been ignorant when he first wrote

  full of contrition lie now wrote explaining at length the
circumstances under which the first card was written by a mere
boy expressing deep regret and enquiring what he could do to
make amends and especially why watson seemed so eager to see
him

  he was now deeply interested and awaited with impatience a
reply from watsons previous importunity he had expected
promptness in this instance but instead there was a long interval
of silence then there came a rather official-looking document
bearing very distinctly the vermilion lake post-office stamp it
proved to lie from the postmaster himself and stilted that john
w watson had died there after an illness of several weeks leav-
ing all his property to george a reade but that all his visible
effects consisted of an old rifle a canoe and some papers whose
contents were unknown enough had been realized from the sale
of these few assets to defray funeral expenses with the exception
of a balance of  would mr reade please remit that
a postal card tragedy



amount  watson the writer stated had always spoken of
ileade as the only friend he had in the world and was always
expecting a visit from him the postmaster added that he feared
the old man had really starved to death having all summer
though too old to hunt or fish much refused several offers of
assistance saying that his friend reade was coming soon and
would see him through

  george reade dropped his work and took the first train to a
point where he could catch a stage for vermilion lake forty
mile of rough riding took him to a collection of twenty or thirty
log shanties where the storekeepers sign directed him to the post-
oftice a short stout man came forward when that official was
asked for and to him reade told his errand and asked about
watson

   we-- said he  john was a pecooliar cuss never knowed
him you say he was mortal fond of you - never stopped talk-
in bout you these last ten years he hada camp up the lake
here bout nine miles and would mostly paddle down saturday
nights and set here talkin bout you couldnt talk bout nothin
else i guess said you was the only friend he ever had hed
no family -said they was all dead - and that no man ever called
him a friend but you that is outside of some of us fellers but
guess we didnt count he wanted to see you pretty bad ever
sence last may-used to expect you every week almost finally
bout last june he came down here and stayed till he died said
you was due every day and used to write you postal cards said
they was the best thing this government ever did - showed they
thought of the poor man sometimes

   we-- toward the last he slept here when he didnt sleep out
and he got lower and lower made me swear i would keep some
papers he had and give em to you when you did come here
they are he had a hard time writin em he got pretty thin
and petered out after that i sold his outfit but kept them
papers no good i suppose  some of the loys thought he was
sort of off in his head but lie wasnt - just queer yes thank
you  thats right he said youd make up anythinshort
wasnt any relation you say  

   no answered reade just a friend


a postal card tragedy

  the  papers  consisted of a few sheets of white wrapping
paper such as storekeepers use laboriously covered with pencil
writing in a large cramped hand the one of greatest immediate
interest to reade was as follows

dear george

   i cant last any longer you oughter came in the spring you was the only friend i ever
had i kept yure card and waited  mebbe  waited to long the iron is there fc you can
find it all riht by following up back of my place to the bijf pine with the x blaze then
go n e about  rod to a big rock covered with moss you cant miss it then go east 
rod to a bull pine then n to where the ledge crops out and fouer it este to the big birch
it aint fur off about  feat you wil find it shure put in a blast or too i was on my last
legs i knew the stuff wab there but i had no money and grub is high all my famly is ded
it is all youru you was the only friend i had on crth that is exept the boys who said i
was crazy why didnt you come in the bpring i rote you six times i hope you aint sick
as  am and the grub give out	your frend

                                        j w watson

  beneath this farewell letter were papers fully establishing
watsons homestead and mineral claims and last of all was the
postal card which reade had written him when a boy his eyes
were moist and his lif trembled when he laid aside the packet

  have you seen the watson hospital on a high breezy bluff
overlooking the dancing waters of lake superior yes it cost a
large sum george a reade paid the bills but he says he did it
with john w watsons money perhaps you also noticed the
old miners home near by that was paid for too with
watsons money or at least with the proceeds of the iron ore
he found and guarded so faithfully reade declares he only
worked the vein when it was too late to do watson any good

  reades eldest boy is named watson - john watson reade
they call him watson for short but george a reade will not
tolerate a postal card in his home at his office or about his busi-
ness in any way and it gives him a heartache when he sees one
the gratitude of mrs hatch

by c b dunham

en morrison the big bluffer of the sheriffs
office with his understudy the junior deputy
was sent out into the country a matter of fifty
miles or so to make an arrest on an indictment
for rustling cattle he brought in his man
alive but unconscious pretty well bruised and
with a dent in his occiput about the size and shape of the butt of
the deputys revolver

   now the sheriffs office had been down on its luck all summer
and it was of a piece with the rest that the grand jury just then
in annual session instead of commending the success of morrison
should listen instead to the prosecuting attorney and to a witness
whom he hurried in from the back country and find a true bill
against benjamin morrison and william judd that they did
upon the said th day of august assault with intent to kill one
job hatch contrary to the law in such cases made and provided
and against the peace and dignity of the commonwealth aforesaid
the sole remaining deputy turned the key upon his associates and
for a time the sheriffs office was wofully short-handed for the
chief said m if the public rather pay my men for keeping the jail
full in that way its all the same to me and less trouble but ill
not appoint another man

  the incarcerated deputies were indignant but not alarmed
they had on their return given a straightforward account of the
circumstances attending the injury to hatch which statement
they repeated without deviation at the trial the sheriff said the
thing was a dirty political trick of the county attorney the
attorney said he was sure of securing a conviction and the prose-
cuting witness pending the trial said nothing there were no
dilatory motions from either side - in fact both urged a speedy

trial - and the case came up within ten days after the indictment
during this interval the condition of the unfortunate man at the
hospital was unchanged he lay unconscious and without speech
his wife never left him but when she went before the jury and
her name appeared upon the indictment as prosecuting witness

  morrison and judd scarcely recognized the gravity of their
situation until they were brought into court upon the day of trial
that it was to le no perfunctory prosecution was evidenced by
the attendance of an eminent attorney  imported as the defence
phrased it u to hamstring the jury

  the jury being finally secured by the usual practice of care-
fully excluding everybody who knew anything about the case i
found myself one of the twelve men duly sworn to hear the
evidence and true judgment give between the people and the
prisoners at the bar then the visiting lawyer with the keen eye
and the soft voice whose habit it was to work jurors as the potter
works his clay gave us his opening statement

  gentlemen he said  i should not be in this case at all but
for a womans tears a great wrong has leen done you cannot
right it - no one can what you can do and what we expect
you to do is to punish the wrong-doers we shall prove to you
that the officers went to the house of this poor man sought a
quarrel with him beat him unmercifully and brought him down
here to die we shall prove this by his wife who saw it whose
presence did not deter these ruffians whose tears at length pre-
vailed on me to prosecute this suit

  replying to this opening the defence said to the jury in a
neighboring city a big brick block some twelve stories high bears
the name of the opposing counsel it was not built with womans
teais the twenty farms he owns were never bought with tears
he works for cash only and in advance and in this instance the
cash comes from the coffers of a political committee we shall
show that the unfortunate man was hurt by an accident resulting
from his own bad temper and to which the defendants avere not in
any manner contributory

  after the evidence of the attending surgeon who declined to
swear that the blow was or was not struck with a revolver mrs
hatch was put  the stand her story was this only one man
fhe latitude op mrs hatci	li

came to her house - morrison mu found hatch at home and
without showing his papers or stating his business interfered with
the ranchmans treatment of a vicious cow hatch was unarmed
and no physical match for morrison after some altercation he
ran toward the house morrison overtook him and felled him with
a blow on the back of the head

  upon cross-examination mrs hatch contradicted herself in some
minor matters and broke down hut she was solid its a rock on
the main fact - that her husband was struck down by the officer
throughout her testimony morrison gave the closest attention
and if i could read the expression on his face it was one of doubt
and surprise he looked not like a man hearing the faithful
account of his own misdeed but as if he were hearing a shocking
story for the first time i made a mental note in morrisons favor
but later when he himself testified i nibbed it out and went over
to the womans side

  the court will always caution jurors against coming to a con-
clusion before the evidence is in but in this case i came to
several all of them erroneous in the course of the trial

  the testimony of morrison and judd was as different as possible
from that of mrs hatch according to their statement which
the ingenuity of opposing counsel tried in vain to break or shake
they had not reached hatchs house when they met him in the
road in a country where every man knows and values a good
horse they had at once noticed the line mount of hatch and had
engaged him in a conversation which ultima ted in a horse race
with twenty dollars up between hatch and judd

  u ill give you a good beating shouted hatch as morrison
started them down a strip of level highway hut his line-looking
horse was just a bit too fat to go up against judds wiry bronco
and he was beaten by a short length seeing which hatch hit his
horse upon the head with the quirt causing him to rear and fall
upon his rider

  that was the whole story the men had to tell - succinct com-
plete but not convincing over and over on cross-examination
it was repeated by both men like a well learned lesson looking
and listening i make up my mind that this evidence was false
mo the womans was true


the gratitude of mrs hatch

  after the arguments of counsel and the verbal fireworks of the
imported lawyer who never made arguments but always and
everywhere stump-speeches the learned judge charged us at great
length to find the defendants guilty if they were guilty and not
guilty it they were innocent and we were locked up

  in the jury room judd of course was acquitted on the first bal-
lot the feeling was strong but not unanimous against morrison
lie had a friend or two who were stout in his defence they
urged that morrison might kill a man  occasion - had done so
perhaps - but never from behind

  there was much argument and  agreement until late in the
evening contrary to every rule of law and in contempt of court
some new evidence was submitted to the jury it came in the
form of a note to me from my friend the doctor shoved under the
door of the jury room behind the bailiffs back it read as follows

   gborgb - at noon to-day dr marston and myself operated on job hatch it waa
only one chance in a hundred that the man would stand it but as he could not possibly
recover without it we took that chance and lost he died within an hour after
trepanning he spoke a number of words indicating excitement the only counected
sentence was  ill give you a good beating i thought yon ought to know

                                                                      will

  those were exactly the words testified as used by hatch at the
alleged horse-race and the note thrown into the scale of conflict-
ing opinion in the jury turned the balance in favor of morrison
and he also was acquitted

  in another part of the west years later  made a long wagon
journey with morrison i came to know his brave nature well
and proved his worth on many occasions one night under the
summer stars when the camp-iires burned low i said to him with-
out prelude

   ben who killed job hatch 

  after a silence  his wife

   are you sure  

   saw it i went out there to arrest him and he was beating
his wife as i rode up she grabbed the gun from his holster and
hit him it was a chance blow but the woman was frenzied and
it felled him like an ox he got about what he deserved and i
the gratitude of mrs hatch



told the woman that id see her through of course any jury
would have cleared her on the facts but she had been a girl well
connected and said shed rather die than have her people know

so i did what i did

   but i cried  what was the occasion for her bad faith 
why did she try to fasten the deed on you  

  after another pause and the lighting of another pipe ben
replied slowly i dont know i have tried to follow a good
many trails into a womans mind but they are always blind trails
they lead nowhere my guess is that she tried to do me up
because i went there to arrest her husband for a thief no sooner
was he gone than she began to idealize him and she was as fierce
against mo in his defence as she had been against him in her own
thats my guess but all i absolutely know is that she seemed very
grateful to me for my promise to shield her and two days after
i got the worst jolt of my life when i was locked up to answer her
charges

  you must have known before the trial came on said i

 what the woman meant to testify why not then have given 
the court the facts  why did you stand by her in spite of her-
self

  no answer

  i wanted to get from him an avowal that he thought he had
done a brave and generous thing

   supposing you had been convicted on her testimony i per-
sisted

  but morrison only said quietly then you would be making
this journey alone

n order for a man to have faith in such an inven-
tion he would have to know ilarrison ely
for ilarrison ely was a genius i had known
him in college a man amazingly dull in latin
and greek and even in english but with ideas
of his own that could not be expressed in
language  is bent was purely mechanical and found expression
in innumerable ingenious contrivances to facilitate the study to
which he had  inclination his self-acting lexicon-bolder was a
matter of admiring wonder to his classmates but it did not serve
 to increase the tenacity of his mental grasp upon the contents of
the volume and so did little to recommend him to the faculty
and his self-feediug safety student-lamp admirably illuminated
everything for him save the true and only path to an honorable
degree

     it had been years since i had seen him or thought of him but
   the memory is tenacious of small things and the big yellow enve-
   lope which i found one morning awaiting me upon my breakfast-
   table brought his eccentric personality back to me with a rush
   it was addressed to me in the archimedean script always so
   characteristic of him combining as it seemed to do the principles
   of the screw and of the inclined plane and in its superscription
   harrison ely stood unmistakably revealed

      it was the first morning of a new cook the latest potentate of
   a dynasty of ten who had briefly ruled in turn over our kitchen
   and ourselves during the preceding three months and succes-
   sively abdicated in favor of one another under the compelling in-
   fluences of popular clamor and in the face of such apolitical crisis
   my classmates letter failed to receive immediate attention un-
   fortunately but not unexpectedly the latest occupant of our

elys automatic housemaid

culinary throne began her reign with no conspicuous reforms and
we received in gloomy silence her preliminary enactments in the
way of greasy omelette and turbid and flavorless coffee the yellow
screed of harrison ely looking on the while with bilious sympathy
as it leaned unopened against the water-bottle beside me

  as i drained the last medicinal drop of coffee my eye fell upon
it and needing a vicarious outlet for my feelings toward the cook
i seized it and tore it viciously open it contained a letter from
my classmate and half a dozen printed circulars i spread open
the former and my eye fastened at once upon this sympathetic
exordium

   doubtless my dear friend you have known what discomfort
it is to be at the mercy of incompetent domestics - 

  but my attention was distracted at this point by one of the
circulars which displayed an array of startling cheering alluring
words followed by plentiful exclamation points that like a bunch
of keys opened to my enraptured vision the gates of a terrestrial
paradise where bridgets should be no more and where ill-cooked
meals should become a mechanical impossibility the boon we
had been sighing for now presented itself for my acceptance an
accomplished fact harrison ely had invented  an automatic
household beneficent genius - a practical realization of the
fabled familiar of the middle ages so the circular set forth

  returning to the letter i read that harrison ely having ex-
hausted his means in working out his invention was unable to
manufacture his machine in quantity as yet but that he had
just two on hand which he would sell in order to raise some ready
money he hoped that i would buy one of his automatons and aid
him to sell the other

  never did a request come at a more propitious moment i had
always entertained a kindness for harrison ely and now such
was my disgust at the incompetence of bridget and juliana
and their predecessors that i was eager to stake the price of a
 household beneficent genius  on the success of my friends
invention

  so having grasped the purport of the circulars and letter i
broke forth to my wife

   my dear youve heard me speak of harrison ely - 


elys automatic housemaid

   that man who is always so near doing something great and
never has done anything said she

  lie has done it at last i declared harrison ely is one of
the greatest geniuses the world has ever seen he has invented
an  automatic-electric machine-servant 

  my wife said  oh 

  there was not an atom of enthusiasm in that  oh  hut i was
not to be daunted

   i am ready i resumed  to invest my bottom dollar in two
of harrison elys machine-servants

  her eyes were fixed upon me as if they would read my very
soul  what do they cost  she mildly asked

   in comparison with the benefits to be derived little enough
listen   i seized a circular at random and began to read 

   the automatic household genius a veritable domestic
fairy swift silent sure  a permanent inalienable first-class
servant warranted to give satisfaction

   ah  said my wife and the enthusiasm that was lacking in
the  oh   made itself eloquent in that  ah    what is the
price she asked again

   the price is all right and we are going to try the experiment
   are we though said she between doubt and desire

   most assuredly it will be a saving in the end i shall write
to harrison ely this very night

  the return mail brought me a reply stating that two electric-
automatic household beneficent geniuses had been shipped me
by express the letter enclosed a pamphlet that gave a more
particular account of the e a h b g than the circulars con-
tained my friends invention was shaped in the likeness of the
human figure with body head arms legs hands and feet it was
clad in waterproof cloth with a hood of the same to protect the
head and was shod with felt the trunk contained the wheels
and springs and in the head was fixed the electric battery the
face of bisque was described as possessing  a very natural and
pleasing expression

  just at dusk an oblong box arrived by express and was duly
delivered in our hall but atni wifes urgent entreaty i consented
not to unpack the machines until next day
klys automatic housemaid



   if we should not get the knack of managing them they might
give us trouble said this wise wife of mine

  i agreed to this and having sent away bridget with a weeks
wages to the satisfaction of all parties we went to bed in high
hopes

  early next morning we were astir

  w my dear i said do not give yourself the least concern about
breakfast i am determined that harrisons invention shall have
fair play

  very well my wife assented but she prudently administered
bread and butter to her offspring

  i opened the oblong box where lay the automatons side by side
their hands placidly folded upon their waterproof breasts and
their eyes looking placidly expectant from under their waterproof
hoods

  i confess the sight gave me a shock anna maria turned pale
the children hid their faces in her skirts

   once out of the box i said to myself  and the horror will
be over

  the machines stood on their feet admirably but the horror
was not materially lessened by this change of position however
i assumed a bold front and said jocosely

  now which is bridget and which is juliana - which the
cook and which the housemaid

  this distinction was made clear by dial-plates and indicators
set conspicuously between the shoulders an opening being cut in
the waterproof for that purpose the housemaids dial-plate was
stamped around the circumference with the words bed broom
duster door-bell dining-room service parlor service etc in
like manner the cooks dial-plate bore the words that pertained to
her department i gave myself first to setting the housemaid
as being the simpler of the two

   now my dear said i confidently  we shall see how this
juliana can make the beds

  i proceeded according to the pamphlets directions to point the
indicator to the word  bed next as there were three beds to
be made i pushed in three of the five little red points surround-
ing the word then i set the clock  connected with the indica-


elys automatic housemaid

tor for a thirty minutes job thinking it might take about ten
minutes to a bed i did not consult my wife for women do not
understand machinery and any suggestion of hesitancy on my
part would have demoralized her

  the last thing to be done was to connect the indicator with the
battery a simple enough performance in itself but the pamphlet
of directions gave a repeated and red-lettered  caution never
to interfere with the machine while it was at work i therefore
issued the command  non-combatants to the rear  and was
promptly obeyed

  what happened next i do not pretend to account for by what
subtle and mysterious action of electricity by what unerring
affinity working through a marvellous mechanism that electric-
automatic household beneficent genius whom - or which for
short - we called juliana sought its appropriate task is the in-
ventors secret i dont undertake to explain i merely narrate
with a click the connection was made and the new juliana
went up-gtairs at a brisk and business-like pace

  we followed in breathless amazement in less than five minutes
bed number one was made and in a twinkling the second was
taken in hand and number three also was fairly accomplished
long before the allotted thirty minutes had expired by this time
familiarity had somewhat dulled that awe and wonder with which
we had gaped upon the first performance and i beheld a smile of
hopeful satisfaction on my wifes anxious countenance

  our youngest a boy aged three was quick to feel the genial
influence of this smile and encouraged thereby he bounced into
the middle of the first bed hardly had he alighted there when
our automaton having finished making the third bed returned to
her first job and before we could imagine mischief the mattresses
were jerked about and the child was tumbled headforemost on
the floor

  had the flesh-and-blood juliana been guilty of such an act she
should have been dismissed on the spot but as it was no one of
us ventured so much as a remonstrance my wife lifted the
screaming child and the imperturbable machine went on to re-
adjust the bed with mechanical exactitude

  at this point a wild shout of mingled exultation amazement and
kiys automatic housemaid



terror arose from below and we hastened downstairs to find our
son john hugging his elbows and capering frantically in front of
the kitehen-door where the electric cook was stirring empty noth-
ing in a pan with a zeal worthy a dozen eggs

  my eldest hopeful impelled by that spirit of enterprise and
audacity characteristic of nine-year-old boys had ventured to ex-
periment with the kitchen automaton and by sheer accident had
effected a working connection between the battery and the indica-
tor and the machine in going off had given the boy a blow
that made him feel as he expressed it  like a funny-bone all
over

  and served you right cried i the thing was set for an
hour and a half of work according to the showing of the dial-
plate and no chance to stop it before i must leave for my ofliee
had the materials been supplied we might have had breakfast
but remembering the red-lettered caution we dared not
supply materials while that indefatigable spoon was gyrating in
the empty pan for my distraction kitty my daughter of seven
years now called to me from up-stairs

    papa you better come quick  its a-tearin up these beds 

    my dear i sighed  theres no way to stop it well have to
wait for the works to run down i must call harrisons attention
to this defect he ought to provide some sort of brake

  we went up-stairs again the b g juliana stood beside the
bed which she had just torn up for the sixth or seventh time when
suddenly she became so to speak paralyzed her arms in the act
of spreading the sheets dropped by her sides her back stiffened
and she stood absolutely motionless leaving her job unfinished -
the b g would move no more until duly set  again

  i now discovered that i was hungrr if that fiend in the
kitchen were only at work about something auljstantial instead of
whipping the air into imaginary omelettes   i groaned

   never mind said my wife  pve a pot of coffee  the
kerosene stove

  bless her she was worth a thousand beneficent geniuses and
so i told her

  i did not return until late but i was in good spirits and i
greeted my wife gayly 


elys automatic housemaid

   well how do they work

   like fiends   my usually placid helpmeet replied so vehem-
ently that i was alarmed  they flagged at first she proceeded
excitedly and i oiled them which i am not going to do ever
again according to the directions i poured the oil down their
throats it was horrible  they seemed to me to drink it greedily

   nonsense thats your imagination

  very well said anna maria you can do the oiling in
future they took a good deal this morning it wasnt easy to
stop pouring it down and they worked- obstreperously that
fiend in the kitchen has cooked all the provisions i am going to
supply this day but still she goes on and its no use to say a word

   dont be absurd i remonstrated  the thing is only a
machine

   im not so sure about that  she retorted  as for the other
one- i set it sweeping and it is sweeping still 

  we ate the dinner prepared by the kitchen fiend and really i
was tempted to compliment the cook in a set speech but recollected
myself in time to spare anna maria the triumph of saying  i told
you so 

  now that john of mine still in pursuit of knowledge had
spent the day studyiug harrison elys pamphlet and he learned
that the machines could be set like an alarm-clock for any given
hour therefore as soon as the juliana had collapsed over a pile
of dust in the middle of the hall john unknown to us set her
indicator to the broom-haudle for seven oclock the following
morning when the fiend in the kitchen ran down leaving
everything in confusion my much-tried wife persuaded me to
give my exclusive attention to that machine and the juliana was
put safely in a corner thus it happened that johns interference
escaped detection i set bridgets indicator for kitchen-cleaning
at seven-thirty the next morning

  when we understand them better i said to my wife we
will set their morning tasks for an earlier hour but we wont put
it too early now since we must first learn their ways

   thats the trouble with all new servants said anna maria

  the next morning at seven-thirty precisely we were awak-
ened by a commotion in the kitchen
elys automatic housemaid



  by george washington i exclaimed the things on
time i 

  i needed no urging to make me forsake my pillow but anna
maria was ahead of me

   now my dear dont get excited i exhorted but in vain
dont you hear she whispered in terror  the other
one -swe - eep - ing i  and she darted from the room

   i paused to listen and heard the patter of three pairs of little bare
feet across the hall up-stairs the children were following their
mothor the next sound i heard was like the dragging of a rug
along the floor i recognized this peculiar sound as the footsteps
of the b g then came a dull thud mingled with a shout from
johnnie a scream from my wife and the terrified cries of the two
younger children i rushed out just in time to see john in his
night-clothes with his hair on end tear down-stais like a streak of
lightning my little kitty and the three-year-old baby stood
clasped in each others arms at the head of the stairs sobbing in
terror and half-way down was my wife leaning over the railing
with ashen face and rigid body her fascinated gaze fixed upon a
dark and struggling mass in the hall below

  john when he reached the bottom of the stairs began capering
like a goat gone mad digging tho floor with his bare heels clap-
ping his hands with an awful glee and shouting

   bet your bottom dollar on the one that whips 
the juliana and the bridget were fighting for the broom i
i comprehended the situation intuitively the kitchen-clean-
ing for which the fiend had been  set had reached a point that
demanded the broom and that subtle attractive affinity which my
friends genius had known how to produce but had not learned to
regulate impelled the unerring automaton towards the only broom
in the house which was now in the hands of its fellow-automaton
and a struggle was inevitable what i could not understand -
johnnie having kept his own counsel - was this uncontrollable
sweeping impulse that possessed the juliana

  however this was no time for investigating the exact cause of
the terrific row now going on in our front hall the beneficent
geniuses had each a firm grip of the broom-handle and they
might have performed the sweeping very amicably together could

they but have agreed as to the field of labor but their conflicting
tendencies on this point brought about a rotary motion that sent
them spinning around the hall and kept them alternately cracking
each other s head with a violence that ought to have drawn blood
considering their life-likeness we should hardly have thought it
strange if blood had flowed and it would have been a relief had
the combatants but called each other names so much did their
dumbness intensify the horror of a struggle in the midst of which
the waterproof hoods fell off revealing their startlingly human
countenances not distorted by angry passions but resolute inex-
orable calm as though each was sustained in the contest by a
lofty sense of duty

  theyre alive kill em i kill em quick shrieked my
wife as the gyrating couple moved towards the stair-case

  letem alone said johnnie-his sporting blood which he
inherits from his father thoroughly roused - dancing about the
automatic pugilists in delight and alternately encouraging the
one or the other to increased efforts

  thus the fight went on with appalling energy and reckless
courage on both sides my wife wringing her hands upon the stair-
case our infants wailing in terror upon the landing above and i
wavering between an honest desire to see fair play and an appre-
hensive dread of consequences which was not unjustified

  in one of their frantic gyrations the figures struck the hat-rack
and promptly converted it into a mass of splinters in a minute
more they became involved with a rubber plant - the pride of my
wifes heart - and distributed it impartially all over the premises
from this they caromed against the front door wrecking both its
stained-glass panes and then down the length of the hall they
sped again fighting fiercely and dealing one anothers imperturba-
ble countenances ringing blows with the disputed broom

  we became aware through johnnies excited comments that
juliana had lost an ear in the fray and presently it was discerni-
ble that a fractured nose had somewhat modified the set geniality
of expression that had distinguished bridgets face in its prime

  how this fierce and equal combat would have culminated
if further prolonged no one but harrison ely can conjecture but
it came to an abrupt termination as the parlor clock chimed eight
elys automatic housemaid



the hour when the two automatons should have completed their
appointed tasks

  though quite late at my office that morning i wired ely
before attending to business long-haired gaunt and haggard
but cheerful as ever he arrived next day on fire with enthusiasm
he could hardly be persuaded to refresh himself with a cup of
coffee before he took his two recalcitrant geniuses in hand it
was curious to see him examine each machine much as a physician
would examine a patient finally his brow cleared ho gave a
little puff of satisfaction and exclaimed

  why man alive theres nothing the matter - not a thing
what you consider a defect is really a merit - merely a surplus
of mental energy theyve had too big a dose of oil few house-
keepers have any idea about proper lubrication and he emitted
another little snort at which my wife colored guiltily

  i see just whats wanted he resumed the will-power
generated and not immediately expended becomes cumulative and
gets beyond control ill introduce a little compensator to take
up the excess and regulate the flow then a child can operate
them

  it was now johnnies turn to blush

   ship em right back to the factory and well have em all right
in a few days i see where the mechanism can be greatly im-
proved and when you get em again i know youll never consent
to part with em  

	   

  that was four months ago the  domestic fairies  have not
yet been returned from harrisons laboratory but i am confidently
looking for the familiar oblong packing case and expect any day
to see in the papers the prospectus of the syndicate which ely in-
forms me is being  promoted  to manufacture his automatic

by rheta childe dorr

n the latter half of the thirties at the court of
  louis philippe the democratic atmosphere
  brought by the  citizen king  from his
  american sojourn was voted by old courtiers

  -	especially the ladies - a very unsatisfactory
substitute for the manners that went out when
charles x departed into exile and the last traditions of the old
regime went with him

  sometimes there were ftes which bad management more often
than not converted into fiascos - in the opinion of the faubourg
saint germain-but there were those whom they amused and
who could laugh with as well as at the fatuous monarch among
them was lady florence brooke whose father-one of the most
efficient statesmen of his day in england - was then in paris on
an important and delicate mission

  i vow cousin she said the morning after one of these in-
congruous gatherings to capt arbuthnot a dashing young at-
tach  i am in lotfe with his majesty he is the only man in
paris who makes me laugh

  the king is rather quaint at times agreed the captain
 but i hope for all that dear florence you will not be tempted
to laugh audibly

   never fear i know why my father was sent here and it will
not be my fault if his mission fails

   i am sorry you are so bored my cousin resumed the young
englishman  but there are some amusing people in society besides
the king and that reminds me of some one who is anxious to
be presented to you - none other than the renowned count
abbas

  and who is he-an arab

the curse of zttlma rebya

  an egyptian - or rather a pure-blooded turk he is one
of those whom old mehemet ali chose in carrying out his pecul-
iarly oriental scheme for the civilization of egypt he selected
three hundred youths from good families many of them from the
very highest nobility and sent them here to europe to be edu-
cated as engineers naval officers physicians and mechanics when
they came back he had them all clapped into prison and there
they were obliged to stop until they had translated their text-
books into arabic then some of them were released but the
majority were turned into schoolmasters awful degradation to
an oriental you know

  well this chap this abbas - he has a jolly lot of names and
titles but we call him simply count abbas - was of the famous
three hundred he somehow got wind of the scheme and very
sensibly failed to return with the others so hes a parisian now
and upon my word he isnt a bad one hes immensely rich as
clever as lucifer and no end popular at the clubs may i present
him  he might interest you

 i wish mehemet ali were here   cried lady florence  i
should adore him but in his default i think the count may do
capt arbuthnot took his leave well pleased to have been a
little useful to his fair kinswoman he hoped some day when
he should inherit his title to become indispensable to her

  he was not the only man who aspired to so much distinction
for lady florence brooke was a very beautiful woman she was
also very brilliant a combination not frequently encountered in
conclusion she was selfish which is commoner

  it ought to be said in her behalf that every formative influence
every detail of her education had been such as to cultivate selfish-
ness in even less promising soil from childhood she had been
encouraged to believe herself infinitely above others of her sex
both in beauty and intellect flattered deferred to consulted and
confided in by her father and his friends she had early attained
an elevation of self-esteem which was far too lofty to be styled
mere vanity

  after his first disappointment that he had a daughter instead of
a son her father resolved to make the motherless girl what he
conceived to be a perfect woman


the curse of zulma rebya

  in his own opinion - and in here - he had been completely
successful she knew mathematics like a senior wrangler latin
like a cardinal and her beautiful lips rolled honeyed greek like
a reincarnated helen

  by the time she entered society she was quite satisfied that she
was superior by virtue of personality to any and all rank

  she was now six-and-twenty and unmarried despite offers

   the thing is simply this papa explained the young woman
 intend to become a model for wives as soon as the man appeals
whom i thoroughly respect and who never bores me as yet i
have not found the two qualifications embodied in one individual
haply this was repeated to capt arbuthnot at all events
the day after he had presented count abbas the egyptian ap-
proached him and said  my dear arbuthnot if you will tell
me how to please your houri of a cousin i promise to smuggle
you into the paradise of true believers hereafter  

   why my dear chap answered the attach seriously  noth-
ing is easier in the first place you must amuse her and if
you cant do that impress her if you should succeed in doing
both - well in that case you would certainly prove yourself an
all-around man

  count abbas did not at first succeed in doing either lady
florence was disappointed to find him so little out of the com-
mon his complexion was no swarthier than many a frenchmans
although his hair and beard were of a peculiar blue-black seldom
seen in europe and lie had the soft dull eyes of an oriental
for the rest he was a fair type of the ordinary young parisian
dandy of the day

  occasionally there crept into his speech an accent a figure an
allusion an evasive essence that was distinctly alien and he soon
divining that these subtle differences were pleasing to her began
to affect them after that she was more gracious and before
long a certain intimacy was established between them she
allowed him to say to her - in his oriental fashion - things
which from others would have been coldly received she was not
above a flirtation but love-making offended her taste

  this woman with the brain of a man possessed the rudimentary
emotional nature of a child she had in place of affections pas-

sions instincts merely a devouring curiosity a love of change a
desire for sensation

  because he fed this restless flame count abbas charmed her
the intensity of his feeling for her if she noticed it at all caused
her no concern she did not wish to inflict suffering but no
impulse to prevent it had ever entered her mind

  lady florences favorite jewels were rubies and of these the
count had some rarely beautiful specimens when she spoke one
day of the enduring nature of such gems he answered with a
strange smile

   my rubies are older than i to be sure but they will not neces-
sarily endure longer

  she laughed delightedly  so you have the elixir of life i 

   did not say so truly i am no seer but i have a certain
unique advantage over other men i know the exact spot on
earth where my death must occur i of course i shall never visit
that place as long as i desire to live it follows that i am im-
mortal if i choose to be

   and how pray did you come into this valuable intelli-
gence  

  it is an inheritance i had it from my fathers lips as he had
it in secret from his father whose father confided it to him

   and yet - they died 

   yes they died but i need not die will you condescend
to hear the tale  

   continue

  the young man leaned far back into the red cushions of his
chair and as he did so a beam of the late afternoon sun caught
the rubies in his hand quickening them into flame his gaze
rested on them in silence and a sudden melancholy came into his
handsome sallow face his eyes glowed dully like banked fires
at this moment lie was not in the least parisian lady florence
regarded him with admiration as she would have admired a rare
vase or a marble or an edition - anything perfect of its kind
as the sunbeam passed his melancholy also passed and he spoke
in his ordinary light-hearted tone

   the story reflects such small credit on one of my ancestors
that family pride ought to prevent my telling it but what is the

sin of ingratitude weighed against the infinite happiness of fur-
nishing you entertainment  know then o my lady that when
your slaves great-grandfather was little more than a stripling he
was sent on an important mission to the city of damascus hav-
ing arrived he was hastening to the house of the dignitary to
whom his letters were addressed when he was abruptly halted by
a great crowd of people which completely filled the narrow street
it may have been a fireor a religious riot at ali events there
was so much excitement that my great-grandsire wasted no time
in taking refuge in a narrow alley between two tall houses hard
by

   three other persons had preceded them thither two women
seated on asses attended by an immense black eunuch one of
the women was old evidently a duenna the other my impres-
sionable ancestor easily surmised to be young and beautiful
both of them were frightened out of their senses it was obvi-
ously the part of a brave young man to reassure them the
blockade lasted a long time what would you have  the end
of it all -or the beginning of it all rather- was a visit the next
day from the old woman an appointment a disguise a meeting
indeed lady these things happen in the east as frequently as in
the west

  the fair one proved to be the daughter of a jewish merchant
she was motherless and somewhat neglected tradition pre-
serves that she was as it were a willow wand for grace and
elegance and her face was as the moon when it rises on the four-
teenth night at the first dropping of her veil my ancestors wit
was confounded and his reasou was unsettled they conversed
together timidly at first afterwards with boldness

   in that country women are not coquettes they are children
in mind and heart and their passions are as the winds of the
desert thus zulma rebya awoke to love as from a deep sleep

   will not attempt to give you the details of the altair in
the first place i do not know them - i only know that the end
came very suddenly my great-grandsire received a summons
from home and was obliged to go with hardly an adieu in the
east no man marries without his parents consent and even if ho
had wished to wed his jewish lady-love it would never have been

permitted so he left damascus alone the damsel was as
usual unreasonable what says your poet  hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned

    as my great-grandsire set forth on his journey he was obliged
to pass the spot where he had seen her first and behold the old
woman was waiting for him with a letter in her hand as he
took the writing a chill like that of the tomb came over him
and no wonder i for it contained no tender farewell but a ter-
rible and a prophetic curse

   thou goest out from the gates of the city where thou didst
promise to abide until death found thee within that promise
shalt thou still keep here shalfc thou die and never shalt thou
die save only here thou and thy son and thy sons sons as long
as they have sons by the virtue of my mother

   my ancestor journeyed on and in due season came to his own
country where he lived and completed his manhood and married
wives after the custom of our holy religion zulma rebya be-
came as a shadow and her bitter words were in time almost for-
gotten almost but not completely for when twenty-five years
later affairs involving a large inheritance made it imperative for
one of the family to go to damascus my great-grandfather refused
to part with his sons he did not believe very strongly in curses
but if there was a risk he preferred to take it on himself

  his business was soon accomplished and in twenty-four hours
he was ready to leave the fateful city but leave he never did
for the cholera was abroad and he perished in agony aud his
ashes were scattered to the winds

    his eldest son my grandfather rose to distinction in the ser-
vice of the sultan who thought so highly of him that he was
often entrusted with delicate matters of diplomacy in foreign
lands it was finally decreed that one of the embassies involved
certain negotiation with a great sheik of the bedawin whose
desert home was near the city of our destiny whether or not
my grandfather hesitated to go i cannot say but it is probable
that he accepted his mission as a soldier his post at the enemys
front a duty to be done even to the death

    the conference with the bedawi lasted several days nearly a
week and resulted to the sultans advantage but other lips than


the curse of zulma rebya

the ambassadors brought back the tidings himself was killed in
a street brawl at the very gates of the city

   when my father then nearly twenty-one heard of his fathers
murder in damascus the curse of zulma rebya fell heavy on his
soul he was a gloomy man - i think i never heard his laughter

-	but he was a brave man as well and his life was as active and
as useful as though no dead womans hand pointed him to a shame-
ful doom he was mehemet alis nearest friend and when that
great man conquered egypt he made my father a marshal of his
army

   in  as you have heard i was sent with other youths to
europe but unlike the others i did not return my father
friend of mehemet still had no desire to see his own son made
into a pedagogue by the tyrant and i was warned in time if i
had been at home -  he paused and a touch of genuine emotion
broke his voice

   what then   cried lady florence with impatience

   if i had been at home my father should not have gone

   he went 

  second in command to ibrahim whose army captured damas-
cus in  many perished in that bloody struggle aud among
the first - my father

  lady florence was as pale as death

   and do you really believe in it she asked breathlessly

  the young man shrugged his shoulders

  she recovering herself began to laugh  tell me then my
dear count how long do you intend to live if i remember none
of your few fellow-immortals found an unending existence an actual
boon at what age will you elect that famous journey to
damascus  

   ah lady florence answered the oriental rising and coming
quickly to her a short time since i fancied that i should never
go but now i know that i desire to live only as long as you do
and i shall start to-morrow uuless you tell me that i may spend
every day of the future near to you - nearer than any other man
or woman

  she stood up in amazement and motioned him back with an
authoritative hand
the curse op zulma rebya



  oh do not reply at once he cried passionately  moon
of paradise listen a moment longer i you are used to be wor-
shipped but not by a man of my race you have heard words of
love but not in the golden language which i shall teach you if

i	am your husband you will say that in europe men do not know
how to love at all you will declare that no other woman in the
world is a wife

  in spite of herself lady florence was shaken by his stormy
ardor her cold breast even caught a faint reflective glow she
sank into her chair trembling and he fell down beside her possess-
ing her hands with his lips

   my princess  you will  you will  

 but you -  she stammered  a turk - a mohammedan - 
 i am not a turk i am not a mohammedan i have no coun-
try no religion if any on the earth offend you your nation is
mine and the room that holds you is the mosque where i will go
to prayer for the rest of our days

   my father will never consent

   why was it impossible for her to dismiss the man outright 

    i have already satisfied your father that i am a suitable alli-
 ance he leaves you perfectly free to accept me if you choose

    i do not wish to marry yet

  ah but when you do it is all i ask that you consent to
marry me when you are ready

   but good heavens i am not even ready to do that she
cried desperately

   at least you do not reject me by allah i will not go to
damascus yet  

  and every day afterwards when he left her he murmured over
her hand  o my lady do i journey to damascus to-morrow  
and every day the question was asked more ardently more
confidently for she was never quite able to say  go  

  she had not the remotest intention of accepting him he did
not fulfil the first condition which she had assured her father was
necessary to her choice and she foresaw that as her lover he
would soon cease to devote himself to merely amusing her

  then why did she not dismiss him not because she feared
to cause his death lady florence was not superstitious the


the cuke of zulma rebya

plain truth is that he overbore her with his personality he was
so near to being her master that she was afraid of him

  the situation soon became intolerable she hitherto so proud
so insolent in her strength of mind stooped now to weakly pon-
dering schemes for getting rid of him and she believed she had
hit upon that which would compel him to abandon his suit she
knew that in the oriental character superstition dread of curses
belief in the evil eye is so ingrained as to be structural she
resolved to make this fact her weapon

  listening one afternoon to his fervid eloquence she said softly
i beg of you a little time for reflection all the world is on its
way to home for the carnival go you too and the very hour
when you return you shall have your answer

  he drew a long breath his black eyes devouring her passion-
ately then he bowed to the ground whispered  i hear and
obey and was gone

  the answer was handed count abbas two weeks later to the
day its first effect was to transform him in appearance into a
maniac locked in his chamber he rushed blindly up and down
until utterly exhausted he fell on the divan clenched his hands
above his head and sobbed like a hurt animal at length his
rage spent he sat up very pale and calm

  one of them lived a week he muttered if i live a week
i shall have time for love and for revenge also if i live only a
day as the first one did - or a few hours or one hour - she is
not worth it but my desire for her is worth it perhaps i will
strangle her at the end i ought to do it

  lie opened the door and said to his egyptian servant ismail
put things together for a sea voyage

 

  on the flat roof of the british consulate in damascus lady
floreuce sat peacefully enjoying the divine love story of the
nightingale she was thinking of the european letters due
probably ou the morrow her fathers would be furious but she
could always pacify him if abbas wrote at all his letter would
be unpleasant but then-she was not obliged to read it when
she returned to paris she felt confident the count would be
abroad she listened for another hour to the nightingale chatted
the curse op zulma rebya	

            with the consul and his wife a cousin of her mother and went
            down to her placid pillow

             the foreign post arrived the next day and so did count abbas

           the interview between them was very brief in the cold
           pallor the averted eye the wordless greeting of the woman who
           entered the room to receive him he read the truth before anything
           was spoken

             m i did not intend this she said  i did not dream that it
	would happen you would not let me refuse you and i believed

            that i could elude you by coming here it was a stupid plan
            and i think very badly of myself i hope you will forgive me
            some day

             she waited for him to speak and his lips moved but no sylla-
             ble escaped them he looked at her with a hollow stare his
             hat fell noisily to the floor he picked it up brushed it me-
             chanically aud resumed his expressionless gaze

             again she broke the painful silence 

              i am sorry to hurt you i did not intend to do so

            with an effort he answered in a broken whisper not your
            fault - the other one

            he turned and felt his way through the door into the street
            where ismail was waiting later they sought a barren lodging
            which was to be their abiding place till the end should come
            abbas did not notice the poverty of the place it was good
            enough to die in and from out its portals he never went - alive

             and did death find him 

             verily no man escapes his fate

            and with what weapon was the blow dealt

              with that which is often reserved for the least worthy among men

by catharine young glen

mong the older residents of tarrytown n y
there are doubtless some who can still point out
with interest the large old-fashioned house with
pleasant walks and cool t re e-arches once the
home of the wall street broker j h ihlefield
mr ihlefields household was composed at that
time - thirty years ago - of himself and wife and a niece and
nephew twenty and twenty-one years of age respectively the
children of his less fortunate brother a v ihlefield then many
years dead though the uncle had discharged wisely and faith-
fully the duties of a parent towards the orphans the nephew -
harry as he was called - had disappointed his expectations
and instead of showing a disposition to settle down into a man of
affaire seemed to regard all forms of business with aversion the
niece margaret on the other hand was not only a girl of unusual
beauty and spirit but of business aptitude as well

  during the month of august  mr and mrs ihlefield and
miss margaret were visiting at saratoga springs - having closed
the house at tarrytown - but the wild harry declined to accom-
pany them declaring that saratoga was too hot and dull and that
he should go yachting with friends

  the family had been but a short time at saratoga when a matter
of business arose which made it necessary for some one of the
family to return to tarrytown at once for its adjustment at this
juncture mrs ihlefield never strong was taken suddenly and quite
seriously ill as it was thought unadvisable for her husband to
be absent miss margaret herself undertook the errand leaving
saratoga by an early train

   the papers will be signed by half-past four she said to her
uncle at parting bidding him affectionate farewell  and by five

you may think of me as with the wests the wests with
whom she intended to spend the night in tarry town were near
neighbors and friends

  the day was close and dusty the journey tiresome the ac-
complishment of her business proved a lengthier matter than miss
margaret had thought certain details of it she was obliged
even then to leave over until the following morning it was not
therefore until after six that she presented herself a graceful but
weary figure at the door of her friends the wests she was met
there with disappointment and perplexity the house was closed
they had gone as she afterward learned a week sooner than
intended the only other friend upon whose hospitality she
would have cared at this hour unannounced and travel-stained
to intrude was likewise out of town

  she was averse to going to a hotel owing to the nature of
her errand and purposing so early a return she did not wish her
presence generally known she turned again slowly into the
street and for a moment stood irresolute

  her own deserted home half a block beyond gleamed white
through the veil of green its windows catching the last faint rays
of sun a vision of comfort rose before her enchanting to her
tired soul - her own delightful room - and an impulse growing
into sudden daring determination gained possession of the girl
she felt for the latch-key in her bosom and a few moments later
was fitting it to the lock

   no one will be the wiser  she exulted with a laugh and a
little natural shiver as she stepped into the silent hall she was
correct so quietly did she move about so carefully did she shield
her light that neither the officer who at intervals patrolled the
avenue nor the watchman whose duty it was to make a round of
the grounds between the hours of ten and twelve received a hint
of her presence

   after a hasty tour of the house to convince herself that she was
really alone - a trial even to a spirit so courageous - she went
at once to her own bedroom and remained there through the
evening with her thoughts and her books

   this room furnished with every luxury had large front windows
on the west looking out upon the avenue  opposite at the eastern

end a door opened into a dressing-room which in its turn com-
municated with the hall on the south and facing the great
louis xiv bed which stood against the northern wall was a
pentagonal alcove formed by a bay window in the broad space
between its windows stood a dresser and an archway richly cur-
tained half divided it from the room

  it was some time past twelve before miss margaret decided to
retire placing her watch together with the costly rings she
always wore in a little jewel-box she shut it away in the drawer
of a table between the avenue windows and removed the key
this she put beneath her pillow

  her preparations for the night concluded she extinguished her
light and folding back the screening blinds lingered a moment
at the open window in the alcove the moon now full had
turned the ihlefield grounds into one great checkerboard lying in
vivid squares of light and shadow it seemed to margaret that
she had never witnessed a more leautiful scene nor known a
silence so profound tho vines about the trellis moon-enthralled
seemed made of trailing stone she herself standing in that
splendor in one of those dreams of billowy whiteness with which
women of her position and wealth are wont to robe themselves
for night would have defied the cunning of the sculptor

  every trace of fear the result of her unusual situation melted
away before that majesty of repose leaving the alcove windows
so that the full tide might pour into the bedroom she calmly laid
her head upon the jrillow and almost immediately slept

  she was to be rudely awakened

  about half-past two - though she had then no notion of time -
she came to herself with a sudden and peculiar sense of danger
that something which rouses us as at the touch of a cold hand
from the numbness of deep sleep into more than two-fold conscious-
ness instinct then compels us to be still every nerve strained
every faculty alert by not so much as the moving of a finger did
margaret betray herself as she opened her eyes

  the room was still in a silvery glow yet not as she had left it
she felt her heart to stop within her - then to beat with choking
suffocating violence the sensation was unendurable she wit
upright gasping as for breath
to save a stainless namk



  with the name motion the figure she saw in the alcove turned
a nickelled revolver instantly levelled sent its gleam across her
face there was an interval of absolute suspense every minutest
detail of the tableau before her stamped itself upon her eyes the
man was tall and stalwart the lower half of his face clean-shaven
the upper hidden by a burglars mask ho spoke still covering
her his voice was distinctly audible yet so low that she seemed
to feel rather than to hear it

   make no alarm keep perfectly quiet i mean you no harm
if you will do so  then as she neither stirred nor spoke -
 do you give me your word  w

  she had no recollection of what she said she supposed that
she must have answered as lie desired

   very well then the muffled voice continued  i am going on
with my work regarding her steadily as though to assure him-
self he lowered the weapon remember i shall hear you if
you make the slightest sound 

  sitting motionless she could watch his every move he began
a rapid searching of the dresser drawer after drawer was turn-
ing out its contents under his still deft hand

  her whirling thoughts took sliape revolved about one central
towering idea she was alone  alono in an empty house amid
a wilderness of shrubbery on a deserted block in the awful silence
of night at all cost at all hazard she must conceal the fact from
this man who evidently from his fear that she would give an alarm
did not know it let him but pass beyond her door and he would
find it out she reasoned that he had come by her alcove window
which she had left open  f by that window he could be induced
to go without looking farther if she could only satisfy him
with what she had 

  with an effort she leaned forward the figure was bending
over the last drawer of the dresser she spoke rapidly hardly
above a whisper hearing her own words as though some one else
were talking

   one moment will you listen  he was silent but from her
first syllable showed attention your staying here is dangerous to
you and misery to mo  you must not disturb the other rooms 
if i make it worth your while will you go will you go at once


to save a stainless name

 she waited but he did not answer

 she dared again her breath was coming short and fast

  if i make it worth your while 

 the dark man regarded her furtively ho was evidently un-
 convinced

  what is it of value that you have he said

 she quivered with the hope of winning

  i have money and jewels  they will more than pay you
 will you let me rise that i may show you  oh will you promise
 me that you will go  

 lie stood a tall straight shadow between the alcove curtains
 through the black blot upon his face she could feel him search
 her soul

  i believe you are speaking the truth   he said at last his
 voice was cool and deliberate  let me have them and i will
 leave you i 

 she threw a long light cloak lying by the bed about her
 shoulders  stay where you are  she commanded  i shall
 not try to pass you  

 she took the little case from its hiding in the table drawer
 as she stood the deep baying of a dog camo up to her from far
 down the avenue something in that sound so grewsome in the
 dead of night doubled the horror of her loneliness with that un-
 known man she wavered battling with herself every element
 in her past had its influence in that short decisive fight with fear

 she took a step toward him and stopped with eyes dilated
 then all the pride of her family in her white-robed figure she
 deliberately crossed the belt of moonlight to his side her face
 was pale and resolute her head thrown back her rich hair falling
 about her in a shimmering cloud the jewels flashed within her
 hands never perhaps had that masked man beheld so radiant
 an apparition

 he started and stepped backward but his gaze falling on the
 stones he uttered an exclamation of deep unfeigned delight

 still holding them for he made no move to take them she
 motioned to the window just behind him

  i have kept my word  she said with simple dignity fc i
 believe that you will now keep yours  
to save a stainless name



   taking the case she extended he placed it inside his coat with
a peculiar courtesy in the action foreign to his kind he turned
as though to obey her then hesitating turned to her again
something - it might have been a thank you it might have
been some whimsical apology for the discourtesy fate had thus
driven him to offer her-parted the thin lips what he would have
said she never knew in the next breath they were set repelling
drawn across the teeth

  through the open dressing-room leading to the hall had come
a sound which transfixed them both there was no mistake 
the knob of tho door below at the foot of the stairs had turned 

  for an instant they faced each other listening  the dark
mans thought was written in his pose - it was that of tho animal
at bay he was in danger the house was awake 

  but margaret in a flash surmised tho truth braving that
housebreaker nerved to her desperate ordeal she realized that
before which her courage melted down like snow her predica-
ment- the strangest maddest whim of chance - has never yet
been paralleled it is likely never will be tho house had been
entered again - from below

  there was oven then a creeping step upon the stair

  escape was easy for the burglar the jewels were safe in his
bosom ho had all and more than ho came to find with a silent
oath ho sprang for the window - but the girl beside him was
quicker than he

  scarce knowing what she did she flung herself upon him and
held him by the arms her slender hands were like bands of
steel her eyes dark with terror were upraised to his

  she poured forth the secret which she had given all to guard
her blanched face was its guarantee of truth

  w you cannot go you cannot leave me  i am alone i 

  he struggled to free himself to force her away but she clung
to him with tho wild abandon of a child she cried out to him
in sobbing whispers in agonized entreaty 

   stay with me help me  help me  i am all alone  

  as they heard the sound again her arms closed upon him

    oh for the love of god  

  the eyes behind tho mask burned down upon her the thought


to bavk a stainless name

at that moment behind the eyes only god knew with a gentle-
ness the memory of which she carried to the grave the man sud-
denly forced her backward into the alcove and drew the curtain
so that it concealed them both

  u let go   he commanded in the same low tone a my right
hand must be free  

  she did as she was bidden standing on the left together
there hidden yet with every other object in the room in bright
relief they waited listening to that coming coming tap tap tap

  was it eternal  would it never end 

  margarets eyes were riveted upon the lino where the light in
the bedroom lost itself in the shadow of the dressing-room beyond
it seemed to her that if anything should disturb that shadow
move within it she must shriek aloud vivid swiftly-changing
pictures began to pass and re-pass before her - every scene since
her parting with her friends every unimportant detail of the day
just gone - only that betwixt her and that familiar yesterday a
timeless gulf now seemed to stretch sho was no more of it than
if it were a dream 

  the step upon the stair had ceased there was jerfect quiet
broken only by the loud hard leating of her heart this stillness
was awful it was worse than the sound she could not turn her
head yet she could half see the figure at her side she caught the
shifting gleam from something  his right

  again there was movement somewhere there in that uncer-
tain darkness of the dressing-room

  she began to hear the swish and swirl of waters rising about
her and to see the dancing of waves something called her back

-	it was the dark mans hand on her wrist that touch reviving
reassuring her transfusing its iron through her blood she could
look again seeing as through a blur

  they were not alono in the bedroom she knew in spite of the
mist that came and went that some indistinct thing was not far
from them and was drawing toward the curtain it was looking
for the dresser the dresser was behind them

  the pressure on her arm tightened  steady steady  it warned
her  soft now soft  she could feel the tension of the sinewy
frame she closed her eyes drawing her own strength from it
to save a stainless kami



  they could have touched the man on the other side of the cur-
tain  they could hear him breathe the fabric trembled botween
them then the groping hand from without laid hold upon it

  there was a motion in the figure beside her and a loud invol-
untary shriek - her own  then came a crash and a blinding trail
of fire and another instant crash and blaze in return the masked
man sprang forward the other man sprang upon him they fired
and fired again one fell and dragged the other they locked
and rolled in a tiger-grip upon the floor they writhed and
panted in their death-embrace there was no word no cry

  clinging to the curtain over them margaret felt the waters rise
again  through the closing darkness she was sensible of a single
sound - the thudding of a club on the stones without - an officer
calling help

  help help  but they would he too late for the human tigers
at her feet her hold on the curtain weakened she swayed and
fell beside them

  it seemed but a moment before she came to herself yet she was
conscious that in some way all had changed she stretched her
arms - they touched soft pillows she was lying on her bed

  she sat up the room was very still she passed her hand
across her eyes a strange thing had come with her awaking -
she was no longer afraid creeping up she slipped from off the
bed and stole out toward the alcove one dark figure lay there
blotting out the moonlight his arm thrown heavily across his faco
the girl bent over breathless looking a sudden wave of anguish
shook her i which of the two  was it lie who saved her

  she knelt beside the dead man fiercely and dragged away his
arm

  there was a jam and crash below stairs as though a door had
given way a confusion of unfamiliar sounds there was a hurried
shufiling noise of feet and whispering voices a round red light
shot along the upper wall but she did not heed it she noticed
nothing sho took the heavy head upon her lap and pressed her
hands against the clotted hair so the police found her staring
down upon it sitting like a stone it was not the face she had
feared to find  the dead man teas her brother


to save a stainless name

  there was a shout below from without and one of the officers
who had come in rushed back thinking it a cry for help she did
not hear it  afterwards she knew that they had found another
man down whore the grounds joined the road unconscious dying
of his wounds - and with her jewels on his breast

  margaret  hie field told her own story neither of the silent
witnesses has gainsaid her and the opinion of the world will not

has been a matter of
guess-work without

  in the laboratories
of the cranitonic

devoted to diseases
of the hair and scalp
the cause of the dis-
ease is learned by
means of a micro-
scopical examina-

from an examination of  different
samples of human hair no fewer than
 different diseases of the hair and scalp
were identified many of them contagious

 composition of the famous new food

 a wide spread interest has been cre-
 ated among good livers as to the compo-
 sition of grape-nuts the new food that
 has come into popular use of late it has
 long been known to physicians chemists
 and food experts that the starchy portion
 of entire wheat flour and barley is trans-
 formed into a true and very choice sugar
 by the act of intestinal digestion in the
 human body this sugar is identical with
 and is known as grape-sugar and it is in
 condition for immediate transformation
 into blood and the necessary structure
 from which the delicate nerve centers are
 built up

 a food expert of the postum cereal co
 lim battle creek mich followed a line
 of experiments until he produced the food
 called grape-nuts of which grape-sugar
 forms the principal part and it is pro-
 duced by following out natures processes
 in a mechanical way

 the new food has a charming flavor and
 can be served instantly either cold with
 cream or by pouring hot milk or cream
 over it one has a hot mush at once

inebriety-a disease

inebriety morphine and other drug habits are
dependent upon a diseased condition of the nervous
system

the victim of the disease again and again puts 
forth the most heroic efforts to reform but his dis-
ease is too absolutely overpowering to be conquered 
by resolutions the will power he would exercise 
if he could is no longer supreme alcoholic stim- 
ulants have so congested the delicate nerve cells
that they cannot respond to the performance of
their functional duties and the helplessness of the
victims condition is as inexplicable to himself as it
seems inexcusable to his friends

the keeley treatment cures this disease by re-
storing ihe nerves to a perfectly healthy state it 
cares by removing the churc the result
is that the patient is left in a normal and healthy
condition and he has neither craving desire nor
necessity for stimulants

over  men and women to-day have been
permanently cured of the disease of inebriety
through dr keeleys treatment which is adminis-
tered only at institutions authorized by him

the treatment at these institutions is pleasant
no restraint is imposed it is like taking a four-
weeks vacation the patient only knows he is cured

tion to any of the following institutions

                                             galvanic current of electricity and how i discovered 
                                             years ago that an appliance was required which would
                                             give a continuous mild current for seven or eight hours
                                             at a time this led me to construct a portable chain
                                             battery which the patient might apply himself and
                                             started me in on a line of experiment that has developed
                                             by degrees by  years of close practical study and appli-

 disease banished

science takes another step forward

it has been known for years that magnetism was an
important factor in curing diseases but not until pro-
fessor thos f adkin of the new york institute of sci-
ence made a startling discovery in connection with this
force did physicians and scientists attach such great
importance as now to its curative powers

professor adkin by combining three forces discovered
a new force many times more powerful than the old
force called human magnetism or that power used by
magnetic healers of the present day by prof adkius
system all diseases the human family is heir to can be
driven from the system forever all who are sick or
have suffering friends will hail this news with great joy
the most marvelous part of this wonderful discovery is
that the life giving force can be projected to the patients
home distance  barrier no faith required cures
are being made all over the world a like principle to
wireless telegraphy is involved in this distant treat-
ment

the results obtained have astonished all who have
tried it

heart disease

some facts regarding the rapid
increase of heart trouble

 heart trouble at least among the americans
 is certainly increasing and while this may be
 largely due to the excitement and worry of
 american business life it is more often the
 result of weak stomachs of poor digestion

real organic disease is incurable but not one
case in a hundred of heart trouble is organic

 the close relation between heart trouble and
 poor digestion is because both organs are
 controlled by the same great nerves the sym-
 pathetic and pneumogastric

 in another way also the heart is affected by
 the form of poor digestion which causes gas
 and fermentation from half digested food
 there is a feeling of oppression and heaviness
 in the chest caused by pressure of the dis-
 tended stomach on the heart and lungs inter-
 fering with their action hence arises palpi-
 tation and short breath

 poor digest ion also poisons the blood mak-
 ing it thin and watery which irritates and
 weakens the heart

the most sensible treatment for heart trou-
ble is to improve the digestion and to insure
the prompt assimilation of food

this can be done by the regular use after
meals of some safe pleasant and effective di-
gestive preparation like stuarts dyspepsia
tablets which may be found at most arug
stores and which contain valuable harmless
digestive elements in a pleasant convenient
form

 it is safe to say that the regular persistent
 use of stuarts dyspepsia tablets at meal time
 will cure any form of stomach trouble except
 cancer of the stomach

 where schlitz beer is aged

    f chlitz beer is stored for months in these refrigerating rooms
            before it leaves our brewery there are four million cubic
            feet of air in these rooms kept at a temperature of  degrees
            storage capacity  barrels

        this is an expensive process in the making of good beer but a
    beer that isnt well aged isn t well fermented and the result is a
    green beer-the kind that makes you bilious

       aging is only second to purity it saves the sick headaches
    resulting from cheap beer it forms one reason why your physician
    always recommends schlitz the health beer that made milwaukee
    famous not only absolutely pure but always well fermented
