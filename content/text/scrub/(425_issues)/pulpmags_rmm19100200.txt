the headlight of genius

by c f carter

                       i

railroad history is not a dry affair of dates and names and dust-
covered happenings long since dead it is living personal real and
most of it is recent of course the great events of railroad history
are fairly clear in the minds of most of us if they arent we can easily find
out what we want to know for example

    when was the first railroad charter granted

    when was the first transcontinental road completed 

    who invented the air-brake and when

    the answers to these questions are at the command of nearly every one

     but what of the lesser things that are still as full of human interest

    when was the first bell-cord used and what is the story that hangs
from it

     who was the first conductor to let a minister travel half fare and why

     the answers to these and other similar questions are amusing

birth of the bell-cord-the first train run by telegraph-origin of
the ministerial half-fare ticket-coming of the ticket-
punch and other wonders

versal use for communication between
train and engine that humble cord
plays an important part in train opera-
tion it is absolutely necessary that the
conductor should have some means of
signaling the engineer always within
reach

in early days before there were auto-
matic air-brakes the bell-cord was very
much more important even than it is
now in europe where passengers are
shut in little compartments where they
are unable to communicate directly with

  r r	

ailroad builders of the early
days were too impatient to
reap the benefits of a good
idea to wait for that idea
to take coherent form be-
fore they put it into oper-
ation consequently many trifling de-
tails of construction and operation had
to be evolved from the inner conscious-
ness of the men who were confronted
with the need of them

take the bell-cord for instance the
forerunner of the air-signal now in uni-


the railroad mans magazine

trainmen or even with other passengers
the presence of the bell-cord has put an
end to the robberies assaults and mur-
ders to which passengers were formerly
liable

  the bell-cord was introduced by con-
ductor henry ayers on the erie rail-
road which being the worlds first trunk
line for that reason had to solve an un-
due proportion of the practical problems
of railroad building and operation

  in the spring of  a few months
after the opening of the line to goshen
forty-six miles from the hudson river
there were no cabs on the engines no
cabooses for the trainmen no way of get-
ting over the cars and no means of com-
munication between the train and the en-
gine

 poppy  invents the bell-cord

  there were no such things as train-
orders for the telegraph had not come
into use nor even printed time - cards
the engineer ran the train to suit him-
self the conductor being merely a col-
lector of fares

  conductor ayers under the sobriquet
of  poppy later became one of the
most widely known and popular conduc-
tors in the history of railroading he
was witty and good-natured and pos-
sessed in a remarkable degree the faculty
of getting  pleasantly with every one
with whom he came in contact

  also he possessed a waist - line that
could be inveigled through the narrow
car-doors only by the exercise of a good
deal of finesse poppy was permitted to
ride behind engineer jacob hamel a
german and the first engineer employed
on the road hamel had always looked
upon the genial poppy with dark suspi-
cion

  when the latter suggested that there
should be some way for him to commu-
nicate with the engine so he could let
hamel know when to stop to let off a
passenger or for any other reason sus-
picion became at once a certainty that the
conductor was seeking to usurp the pre-
rogatives of the engineer hamel de-
cided to teach the presumptuous one his
place

  one day poppy had an idea pro-
curing a stout cord he ran it from the

rear of the train to the framework of
the cabless engine he tied a stick of
wood on the end of the cord and told
hamel that when he jerked the stick up
and down that he-hamel-was to stop

  hamel growled out something inar-
ticulate and as soon as poppys back
was turned he cut the stick of wood from
the cord and tied the latter to the frame
of the engine next day the same per-
formance was repeated

  on the third day poppy rigged up the
stick of wood at piermont the terminus
of the road and told hamel that if he
cut the cord again or ignored his efforts
to signal him he would thrash him when
he got to goshen

  when the train reached goshen the
signal-stick was gone and the end of the
cord was trailing in the dirt poppy
walked forward to the engine and with-
out uttering a word took off coat vest
and hat loosened his ample collar rolled
up his sleeves took a reef in his belt
yanked hamel off the engine and sailed
into him

  it was as pretty a set-to as the most
ardent -sport could wish to see hamel
had all the dogged tenacity of his phleg-
matic race while poppy in spite of his
bulk was agile as a cat neither knew
anything about boxing neither had any
idea of yielding

  one represented prerogative the other
championed progress for several min-
utes they puffed and mauled each other
and tore up the earth to the delight of
several bystanders until progress tri-
umphed as she always does

  that memorable victory on that balmy
may morning settled for all time the
question of who should run trains also
it introduced an exceedingly important
device once the idea was hit upon it
didnt take long to replace the stick of
wood with a gong and then the bell-
cord was fully launched upon its useful
career

sending umbrellas by wire

  poppy ayers took a good deal of pride
in his invention and made use of it on
every possible occasion one day in
 when everybody was talking about
the telegraph one of his passengers
bound west from new york was an old
the headlight of genius



countrywoman who had been to the city
on a visit for the first time in her life

  soon after leaving piermont poppy
found the old lady in a paroxysm of
tears andsobs with difficulty he calmed
her sufficiently to learn that in the ex-
citement of her first journey she had
left her umbrella on the boat at pier-
mont it was an umbrella that had been
in the family for
years and could
never be replaced

  never mind
mother said pop-
py  ill get your
umbrella for you by
telegraph

  with this com-
forting assurance

poppy struck an
attitude reached for
the bell-cord wrig-
gled it a few times
cocked his head as
if listening intent-
ly wriggled the
cord again a n d
said

   all right moth-
er  your umbrella
will be here in a
few minutes

  then he went
forward to the bag-
gage-car and came
back bearing the
missing umbrella
aloft triumphantly
to the unspeakable
amazement of the
old lady

    got it by wire
madam said pop

py-

   it was a rule that the porters were to
pick up all articles left in the cabins of
the boats by travelers and take them to
the baggage-cars where they could be
claimed at any stage of their journey by
the absent-minded ones poppy knew
just where to look for the umbrella when
he telegraphed for it with the bell-cord

first clerical tickets

  to poppy ayers is also due the credit
of originating the custom of allowing

ministers of the gospel to travel for half
fare early in the spring of  rev
dr robert mccartee pastor of the
presbyterian church at goshen who
made one or two trips to new york every
week was a passenger on poppys train
bound for the city there had been an
exceptionally heavy rain the night be-
fore and as the frost was just coming
out of the ground
the track was cov-
ered with mud in
the cuts so deep
that the train was
delayed for hours

 the passen-
gers as passengers
always have done
since the days of
the ark uttered
maledictions on the
management for the
delay as the
hours wore on
while the train
stood still some of
tlie more spirited
ones drew up a set
of resolutions cen-
suring the railroad
company in strong
language for its in-
competence in per-
mitting the delay

  the resolutions
were passed around
for signatures

  when dr mc-
cartee was reached
he said he would be
most happy to sign
the resolution if
the phraseology
were slightly changed being asked to
suggest the changes he had in mind he
wrote the following

   whereas the rain has fallen  at a
time ill-suited to our pleasure and con-
venience and without consulting us
and

  whereas jack frost who has been
imprisoned in the ground some months
has become tired of his bondage and has
determined to break loose and his head
may already be seen coming out there-
fore be it

   resolved thus and so


the railroad mans magazine

fviw

  neither knew anything about boxing

  when the good dr mccartee arose
and read these resolutions in his most
sonorous voice there was a heart- laugh
and nothing more was heard about cen-
suring the management of the road
poppy ayers was so delighted over the
incident that he would never accept fare
from dr mccartee thereafter

birth of the ticket-punch

  not being selfish dr mccartee sug-
gested after enjoying his free transpor-
tation for a few weeks that all minis-
ters be allowed to travel upon the same
terms as himself the company agreed
and for a few weeks no minister paid
any fares to ride on the erie then an
order was issued that ministers were to
be charged half fare and that order es-
tablished a precedent which was and is
still universally observed

  the ticket-punch too was evolved on

the oldest trunk line when the erie
began to carry passengers in  there
were no station-agents each conduc-
tor when he started on his run was given
a tin box which contained a supply of
tickets and ten dollars in change pas-
sengers bound for new york gave up
their tickets on the boats for the erie
terminal was at piermont twenty-four
miles up the hudson

after station-agents were appointed
the tickets for some years were of heavy
cardboard bearing the signature of the
general ticket-agent these were taken
up and returned to be sold over and over
again until they were too much soiled for
further use

 the public discovered a way to beat the
 company on these tickets a passenger
 bound for new york would buy a through
 ticket to the city which he would show to
 the conductor according to custom at
 the last station before reaching new
 york he would get off and buy a
 ticket for the remainder of the trip
 then he would put his through ticket
 in his pocket and surrender the short-
 distance ticket

on the return journey he would re-
peat the process buying a ticket to desti-
nation and then getting off at the last
 stop before reaching his home station
and buying a ticket to be surrendered
then he would be in possession of tick-
ets for a round trip to new york which
he could use as often as he chose by mere-
ly paying fare for a few miles at the end
of each trip

   it was a long time before the railroad
 company discovered the fraud then a
 system of marking the tickets by lead-
 pencil was adopted but pencil-marks are
 easily erased and the plan didnt work
 the only mark which could not be tam-
 pered with was one which mutilated the
 ticket and the necessity for some instru-
 ment that would do this neatly led to
 the adoption of the ticket-punch

train-despatcher appears

   the movement of trains by telegraph
was developed first on the erie railroad
in  at the beginning of that year
the new york and erie telegraph com-
panys lines were completed along the
railroad
the headlight of genius



  d h conklin a printer who had
learned to operate after a fashion was
sent to goshen by charles minot the
superintendent of the road to adjust a
battery which would not work conk-
lin racked his brain over the matter for
two days but at last he got the battery
straightened out

  minot was so delighted to find a man
who could do anything at all with the
telegraph that he insisted upon conklin
taking the position of operator at pier-
mont he was the first telegraph-oper-
ator regularly employed on salary by a
railroad company

  at first he didnt know what salary
he was to get in fact the company was
so slow in adjusting the matter that he
was obliged to borrow money to pay his
living expenses but at last superintend-
ent minot decided that thirty dollars a
month would be about right and conk-
lin agreed with him

  after the telegraph line was ready for
business they didnt know what to do
with it beyond sending an
occasional unimportant
message beginning  dear
sir and ending with
 yours respectfully it
was left to conklin to make
the first practical applica-
tion of the telegraph in
expediting r a j  r oa d busi-
ness

  without the telegraph it
was of course not possible
to know what an incoming
train was bringing in the
way of live stock or other-
freight it was therefore
the custom to put off loading
the barges and boats by
which freight was trans-
ferred from the end of the
line to new york until after
the last train of the day had
arrived so -that live stock
and perishable freight might
be moved with the least pos-
sible delay under this ar-
rangement the boats did not
get to the- city until late in
the morning

  one day it occurred to
conklin to ask the operator
at goshen to find out how

many cattle there were on the east-bound
train and to telegraph the information
to him having found out that the train
was on time and that it was bringing a
certain number of cattle he told the cap-
tain of the boat to go ahead and load
leaving room for fifty-four head of cattle

  there was a grand powwow in which
the captain the agent and about every-
body else around the pier took part to
discuss this strange innovation al-
though wholly incredulous the majority
decided to go ahead and try it to the
amazement of every one the train did ar-
rive on time and it did have the pre-
cise number of cattle conklin had pre-
dicted

  the boat was ready to leave as soon
as the cattle were driven aboard the
result was that when superintendent
minot reached his office in the morning
and inquired about the boat he was
greatly astonished to learn that it had
arrived and unloaded hours ahead of
the usual time when he learned how


the railroad mans magazine

the feat had been made possible he was
delighted

   yet even with this strong hint it took
 superintendent minot nine months to hit
 upon the idea of using the telegraph to
 control the movements of trains at that
 time trains were run simply by the time-
 card trains going east had the right
 of way over west - bound trains of the
 same class

a flagman on foot

   if an east-bound train did not reach
its meeting-point on time the west-bound
train according to the rules had to wait
one hour and then proceed under a flag
until the opposing train was met that
is a flagman would be sent ahead on
foot and twenty minutes later the train
would follow moving about as fast as a
man could walk

   under this interesting arrangement
when a train which had the right of way
was several hours late as often hap-
pened the opposing train would have to
flag for thirty or forty miles

on september   superintend-

	ent minot was on conductor w h
stewarts train west bound they were
to meet the east-bound express at tur-
ners as the east-bound train did not
show up on time minot told the oper-
ator to ask goshen fourteen miles west
if it had arrived there on receiving a
negative answer he wrote the worlds
first telegraphic train-orders as follows

   to operator at goshen 

   hold east-bound train till further or-
   ders

charles minot superintendent

   then he wrote another order which
he handed to conductor stewart read-
ing as follows

   conductor stewart turners

   run to goshen regardless of oppos-
   ing train

charles minot superintendent

   conductor stewart went forward to
engineer lewis and showed him the
order lewis read it carefully twice-
and handed it back to stewart

    do you take me for a darned fool 
 snorted lewis  ill not run on that
 thing

this being duly reported to minot he

went forward and tried to convince lewis
that the order was all right lewis re-
fused to pull out he wasnt looking
for a chance to cross the jordan that
morning so he proposed to abide by the
rules in such cases made and provided

  finding lewis obdurate minot
climbed on the engine and took charge
of it lewis jumped off and established
himself in the rear seat of the rear car
leaving the door open so he could jump
when the crash came

  but nothing happened minot trun-
dled along at a good clip until he
reached goshen finding on inquiry
that the opposing train had not reached
middletown he gave orders to hold it
at that point until his arrival and pro-
ceeded he kept on moving under tele-
graph orders until port jervis was
reached where the east-bound was met

   the account of the superintendents
conduct caused s great commotion on the
road the engineers in solemn conclave
agreed that they would not run trains on
any such crazy scheme

   but the revelation of the possibilities
of the telegraph in facilitating train
movements had settled the matter beyond
the possibility of change by all the de-
crees of all the engineers in the world
superintendent minot issued an order
that telegraphic orders must be obeyed

testing douglas

  but an important improvement re-
mained to be made charles w doug-
las a printer who had picked up a smat-
tering of telegraphy by stealth at night
in a telegraph-office in the same building
with the printing-office in which he
worked was given a position as telegraph
operator at addison new york

  one day he wrote out a train-order
without consulting the tape in those
days all messages were printed in dots
and dashes on a paper tape the con-
ductor was horrified and refused to ac-
cept the order until douglas had spelled
it out from the tape

  he considered douglass conduct so
dangerous that he reported the matter to
superintendent of telegraphs l g til-
lotson at elmira tillotson was as hor-
rified as the conductor had been he
summoned douglas to elmira forthwith
the headlight of genius



and proceeded to give him a scathing
lecture upon his dangerous departure
from established usage

 but said douglas  if you can read

your own station-call by sound why

cant you read a whole

message the same

way 

 

cant

  but you can and
 ill prove it

   thereupon douglas
 proceeded to write
 down a message by
 sound which tillotson
 verified from the tape

 but he was not con-
 vinced all the rest of
 the afternoon doug-

	las was put through
 test after test

   he went through
 them all without a
 mistake even then
 tillotson was not con-
 vinced he sent doug-
 las back to his post at
 addison and tested
 him again that test
 settled the matter and
 numbered the days of
 the telegraph-tape

    the first shipment
 of milk by rail ever
 made in the world was
 made in the spring of
  over the erie
 railroad to new york
 city as usual with
 all new departures
 every one knew that-
 it couldnt be done

 but thomas selleck
 one of tlie two original station-agents on
 the erie railroad thought it could be
 done successfully

    selleck was appointed agent at ches-
 ter in september  he was quick
 to notice the excellent quality of orange
 county milk for he had lived in new
 york city where in those days the only
 milk available was from cows kept in
 stables in the city and fed on clops from
 breweries and distilleries

    he suggested to the farmers that they
 would do well to try shipping milk to

 the city by railroad but they jeered at
 the idea of sending it such an unheard-of
 distance as fifty miles subjected to the
 jarring and jolting of the trains why
 it would sour and be churned into but-

termilk before it had gone half-way the
idea was-preposterous

  in those days dairying in orange and
other interior counties consisted in ma-
king butter throughout the year and pack-
ing it down to be taken by wagon to
newburg where the wagons were load-
ed on barges and taken down the river
to the city there every farmer would
drive to washington market and sell his
butter himself

  the second tuesday in november was
the date of the great butter market the

because you

r -
 f

twenty minutes later the train would follow


the railroad mans magazine 

farmers called it  the day of the big
trip the butter brought from twelve
and one-half to fifteen cents a pound

   selleck finally decided to try shipping
milk himself he rented a store at 
reade street new york city and an-
nounced that he would have fresh orange
county milk for sale there on a certain
-may morning in  he finally in-
duced four farmers to deliver a total of
two hundred and forty quarts of milk
in old-fashioned blue churns which he
shipped to his city store he paid them
two cents a quart for the milk and paid
freight at the rate of twenty cents a hun-
dred pounds

icing the milk

  the milk reached the store in good
condition and sold at four cents a quart
instead of the established rate of six
cents for swill-milk but there was not
enough to supply the demand selleck
increased his shipments as fast as he
could but he could not supply one-half
the demand

  every morning there would be a line
of men women and children a block
long waiting at the milk depot for the
arrival of the boat the farmers were
glad enough to sell their milk for two
cents a quart for there was more money
in it at that price than in making butter
to sell at fifteen cents a pound

  when hot weather came trouble ar-
rived with it the milk soured before it
reached new york the farmers had
been in the habit of delivering the milk
just as it came from the cows without
taking the trouble to cool it finally
jacob vail of goshen procured a coil
of lead pipe which he placed in a hogs-
head filled with ice

  he poured his shipment of milk
through the pipe it came out cold and
arrived in the city in good condition

  then another inventive genius discov-
ered that all this costly apparatus was
not necessary that the same result could
be obtained by merely setting the pails
of milk in a spring or even a tub of
cold water until the animal heat was
driven off

   then the troubles of the milk business
were transferred from the farmers to
the railroad management which had to

find a suitable car for transporting milk
and then to meet the necessity for special
trains to collect it

  the second year of the milk trade by
rail produced a revenue of sixteen thou-
sand dollars for the railroad the third
year  quarts were shipped by
the erie saving the consumers one hun-
dred and twenty thousand dollars by re-
ducing the old price of six cents for
swill-milk to four cents for real milk
while at the same time the fanners re-
ceived forty-five thousand dollars more
than they would if they had converted
their milk into butter at fifteen cents a
pound

  milk is now brought to the new york
market from hornellsville three hun-
dred and fifty miles away somewhat far-
ther than the fifty miles which the farm-
ers of orange county once thought an
impossible distance milk has built five
branch roads in orange county at a cost
of four million dollars and has returned
to the county fifty million dollars new
york now consumes  quarts of
milk every day and every quart of it
comes by rail

earliest iron bridge

  the first iron railroad bridges three
in number were built on the erie rail-
road in s  but they were all replaced
by wooden bridges because one of them
over westcolang creek near mast hope
gave way under a train on july  
when a freight and live stock train of
seventeen cars east bound on that date
struck westcolang creek bridge nat
hatch the engineer heard a loud crack-
ing sound

  he instantly pulled the throttle open
with the result that the engine got over
safely but the tender and fifteen cars
went down carrying with them brake-
man adam tice george randall a
drover and j l clapp his helper one
hundred cattle and a number of sheep
and hogs were in the cars randall and
tice were alive but were penned in so
that they could not get out

  while efforts to extricate them were
being made both were kicked and
crushed to death by a steer which lay
upon them clapp died soon after being
taken out

hundred and fifty feet deep and nine
hundred feet wide a congress of engi-
neers was assembled to devise a span

  a wooden bridge of fifty-feet spans was
decided upon it required two years of
time and an outlay of  when it
was opened on the th of august 
 feet of lumber the product of
three hundred acres of pine forest had
gone into its structure

  but the science of iron bridge build-
ing was making progress  and when the
great wooden bridge burned in  it
was replaced in forty-seven days with a
modern iron one

  it is a fact pretty generally overlooked
that the first successful fast trip ever
made by a locomotive was made by an
american engineer on an american road

first trip on it allen was chief engineer
of the south carolina railroad the first
railroad ever built which was designed
from the outset to be operated by loco-
motives he was afterward president
and chief engineer of the erie railroad
engineer of high bridge new york and
the inventor of paper car-wheels

  the story of this first locomotive trip
ever made was related by mr allen in an
address at a dinner at dunkirk may 
 celebrating the opening of the erie

   when was it where was it and
who awakened its energies and directed
its movements on august   on
the banks of the lackawaxen at the
commencement of the railroad connect-
ing the canal of the delaware and hud-
son canal company with the coal-mines

this was two months before the famous
trip by stephensons rocket which is
generally credited with first honors the
engineer who made this historic trip was
horatio allen who was born at schenec-
tady new york on may  

on january   mr allen was
sent to england to buy three locomotives
one arrived in new york early in 

it was sent to honesdale where it was
set up by mr allen who also made the

  after this accident the company lost
faith in iron bridges all bridges on the
road including the famous structure over
the chasm of the genesee river at por-
tage were of wood this chasm was two

the railroad mans magazine

and he who addresses you was the only
person on the locomotive

   the circumstances which led to my
being alone on the engine were these
the road had been built in summer the
structure was of hemlock the rails were
timbers notched on caps placed far apart
the timber had cracked and warped from
exposure to the sun after about three
hundred feet of straight line the road
crossed lackawaxen creek on a high
trestle about thirty feet above the water
on a curve of three hundred and fifty to
four hundred feet radius

   the impression was very general that
this iron monster would break down the
road or that it would leave the track at
the curve and plunge into the creek my
reply to these apprehensions was that it
was too late to consider the probability
of such an occurrence that there was no
other course but to have a trial of the
strange animal which had been brought
there at great expense but it was not
necessary that more than one should be
involved in the same fate that i would
like to take the first ride alone and the
time would come when i should look
back to the incident with great interest

   as i placed my hand son the throt-
tle i was undecided whether to go slow
or with a fair degree of speed but hold-
ing that the road would prpve safeand
preferring that if we did go down to go

handsomely and without any evidences
of timidity i started with considerable
velocity passed the curve over the creek
safely and was soon out of hearing of
the cheers of the vast assemblage present
at the end of two or three miles i re-
versed and returned without accident to
the place of starting having made the
first  locomotive trip on the western
hemisphere

  the first attempt at train-wrecking
ever made took place in the last week of
november  a track-walker on a
section near andover new york on the
erie railroad found an obstruction on
the track that had evidently been placed
there with the intention of wrecking the
east-bound express a watch was set

  at  pm friday november  
a few minutes before the east-bound ex-
press was due two men appeared on the
track carrying a log chain they went
to a wrecked gravel-car and taking from
it a pair of wheels chained them to a
culvert where they could not be seen until
the train was close upon them

  the two were seized and taken to jail
at angelica where they were found to
be george palmer a cabinet-maker aged
twenty-five and sam allen a black-
smith aged twentyone they were tried
and convicted of attempting to wreck a
train and on february   were sen-
tenced to serve four years each in prison

the engines hymn

          by h  j smith

     written for the railroad mans magazine

i love to hear the whistle blow

    t sort of lets a person know
    that all is well that the engineer

is watching to see that the way is clear

theres something comforting in its
sound

while on some journey you are
   bound

if you know its language you can
   tell

if theres something wrong or all is
    well

all aboard toot toot the defi-
    ant sound

is echoed and echoed for miles
   around

and ever as we speed along

you catch the spirit of the song
sometimes at night when all is still
i can not close my eye until
ive heard the call of the night express
thundering on to the golden west
i can hear it whistle long before
it passes by the station door

and i listen until the- sound grows
    dim-

and go to sleep to the engines hymn

             by calvin johnston

            even the ghost of his grandfather couldnt
            swerve tim grogan from his calculations

  mm grogan remarked
raifailft the old switchman filling
his pipe with the yard-
i	masters tobacco and ab-

 niiilwi  sently putting the pouch
 into his pocket the yard-
 master snapped his fingers and his com-
 panion eagerly returned the pouch

    to think i wud forget such a thri-
 fle  said the old switchman sadly
  and when id rather be srnokin soft
 coal than this stuff any day

   the midnight freight clattered past
 over the crossings and two other mem-

 bers of the yard crew entered the switch-
 shanty and put down their lanterns

   what about tim grogan  demand-
ed the vardmaster sternly

   he was the lad for the higher arith-
metic answered the old switchman
musingly high enough to go in for
asthronomy subtractin was play to
him and we used to call him superintind-
int av division-though his only job was
herdin cars with a lead-pencil in the
yards at comeback

  removing the pipe he gazed into the
bowl and lapsed into silence

 grogan wud sit on the station platform and add up the car numbers for

   throw in a little more coal sug-
gested one of the switchmen from his
perch on the tool-box and with an ex-
clamation of disgust the yardmaster
hurled his pouch at the old switchman
who all but emptied it into his pipe and
pocket

   though tis little use i can make av
it he complained  i am gettin ould
and wind-broken from overwurruk and
can hardly get a draft through the pipe
-prhaps the flue is choked up a little
bit wance i cud draw like a suction-
pump-

  the switchman on the tool-box reached
for a wad of oily waste with a look there
was no mistaking and the ancient nar-
rator suddenly took up his story as if the
thread had remained unbroken from the
very first word

   whin there was nothin else to do
which was from noon till  am tim
grogan wud sit on the station platform
at comeback and add up the car num-
bers for the iddication there was in it
aftherward he wud calculate the date
av your birth which made him disliked
by the women or the date av the super in-
tindints death which made him popular
with the men for he proved it was no
distant day ivirything he did was the
raysult av careful calculatin

   he knew the exact time it wud take
the flier to come from the bridge to the
station and wud sthroll across the track
in front av it so close that the suction
wud pull out hairs from his head and
scatter thim like sparks for tims head
was the color av a prairie-fire the fric-
tion av figures kapin his skull at a red

   kitty flannery who was the chief
despatcher at comeback with no subor-
dinates despised him for calculatin
though tim had kept her company for
three years eight hours and wan min-
ute the eight hours bein the length
av his call the night before while tim
was calculatin shud he ask her to
marry him and the wan minute bein the
time it tuk kitty to answer in the nega-
tive

   nixt day tim sat in the lunch-room
estimatin the number av chews it tuk to
reduce a sinker to food whin kitty came
in the two av thim nodded with cau-
tion and afther a bit tim asked

      have ye calculated well on what i
 asked ye last night  	-

      i have answered kitty with great
 entusiasm  i have given eight hundred
 and fifteen cheers meself actual count
 for rayplyin as i did

      ye cud give thim in two hours and
 five minutes said tim have ye filled
 in the balance av the time by regrettin
 me  

   regret ye she replied with a
 laugh and toss av her brown curls  ye
 cold-blooded polthroon who wud cal
 culate on askin a lady to marry ye as ye
 wud on buyin a horse niver will i
 regret ye

     raymimber woman said tim
 raisin his pencil  i have calculated the
 day ye were born ye are too old ivir to
 have that question raised again

     kitty for all her blue eyes and pink
 cheeks gave him a look as black as a
 witch  ye are a polthroon she said
 wance more

    tim felt this was a hard wurrud
 which it was above the power av the
 highest arithmetic to ixplain he thought
 it over in a dark humor feelin that she
 had raised a wall betwane thim

      yez answer last night was correct
 he tould her thin as if it had been a-sum

 cheerin with this he raytrated cau-
 tiously through the door cornin back for

 the telygraph office

     afther a while he went into the sta-
 tion - room and stood around prisintly
 the ingineer av the switch-ingine came in
 too and kitty who had pretended not
 to notice who was there stopped behint
 the counter av the telygraph office

     she smiled at the ingineer who came
 up to the windy and stood sideways with
 wan eye glarin at tim and the other
 winkin at kitty till the fireman rang the
 bell for him tim took his place before
 the counter but she paid no attintion till
 he had called her twice

      i am not to blame he said  kitty

   ye called me a hard name woman
 sure look it up in the arithmetic

 tim was defeated with great loss av

gan lookin as blue as the caves below
ivillarney where tims grandfather used
to raytire to curse his landlord in pri-
vacy

    twas a bould man that ancistor
said tim callin him to mind  i calcu-
late he wud have cursed a switch-ingi-
neer-if he had owed him rent but he
used up all the courage that had come

    beware woman it is the pride av

this was out av ear-shot for he didnt

   when he got through upbraidin his
ancistor for bein a spendthrift av the
family courage it was time fur the
through flier and afther a calculation
which wud have humbled ashthronomy
to the dust he strolled across the track
with kitty watchin him from the windy

   this time the draft av the train not
only plucked his hair like the fingers av
a banshee but almost dragged out his

head by the roots and left him spinnin
like a top in the cinter av the track behint
the train when he cud walk agin with-
out feelin that he was on a turn-table
tim looked in at the telygraph office
where kitty lay across the table in a
faint

   ye are losin color from worryin
over that answer said tim

    ye are a fool whispered kitty
white as a ghost

    it is the raysult av calculation
rayplied he

     not so it is the raysult av nature
said kitty and as her face from bein
very white began to grow very black tim
went away quickly to curse the ancistor
who had left his descendants to shiver
with fear

   that evenin the ingineer walked
home with kitty and later when tim
passed the house he saw him makin a
call for kitty had placed him so the
lamp wud throw his shadow on the
windv-curtain

    that is a big strong shadow said
tim  but i wud stand up against it if
the owner wud raymain quiet

   thin he went to flannagans the
flagman who had a library av his own

  what is polthroon asked tim

     i will tell ye says flannagan  i
have  polthroon  at me tongues end
bridget where is the dictionary

    sure i traded it for two magazines
av fashion answered mrs flannagan
who had wore a polky-dot calico and
an osthritch-feather with an elbow in it
for three years

    ye are a peacock who wud feed
on book-worms said flannagan woild
at the thought  where is the other book
av the library  

     i used it for currul-papers we have
wurrds enough in the house already

    i will go to the beer-garden said
flannagan in a threatenin voice

     it is an invitation said she put-
tin on her hat and so tim and flanna-
gan stayed at home and played pinochle
till they quarreled and the two av thim
thrust tim outdoors

   he went past kittys house again
the ingineer was still callin and tim
calculated the width av his shoulders on
the curtain before undoublin his fists and
walkin on softly

   but next mornin tim went to take
the car numbers wonderin why the sun
didnt rise as he came back toward the
depot through the yards it got so dark
that the caves below killarney wud
have blinded him with light

   the switch-ingineer was passin in
and out all day while tim sat on the
platform calculatin the number av times
the wurrud  polthroon  wud occur in
his own funeral service which he set for
friday

    i cannot outlive friday wheniver
it comes he tould himself and he felt
that life was passin him as a pay-car

   tim knew this as well as any wan
but on this day he had no mind to give
it calculation till toward evenin while
waitin for the flier he saw kitty rush
out onto the platform with a piece av
paper flutterin in her tiny fist

   there was tears av fright in her big
blue eyes as she raised her hand to beckon
him thin raymemberin the slight tim
had put upon her by takin no for an
answer and by not drivin the ingineer
out av her favor she stopped short and
waved her hand down the yard instid

the inside of the freight
department

by t s dayton 

when a boy gets a watch he always wants to examine the works when
he gets older he doesnt care but he still carries with him the passion
for looking at the inside of things to find out how they work this
curiosity is the secret of achievement this article is for the young men who
have that wide-awake curiosity if you read it you will not find your curiosity
satisfied but only more excited then you will get in and do something that
is what we want

how a great railroad organizes its chief revenue-producing traffic
a glimpse of the big and little men who do the
work and how they do it

he traffic-manager of a rail-
way is usually one of the
highest salaried men on the
official list his post is
close-if not next-in real
importance to that of the
president even if a few vice-presidents
may outrank him on many of the large
systems however the traffic-manager is
one of the vice-presidents

  although he has charge of passenger
traffic as well as freight it is with freight
affairs that he is most especially con-
cerned even though he has as his chief
lieutenant a highly qualified general
freight-agent the freight earnings of

a railroad are about three times as much
as the passenger earnings and seventy-
five per cent of the roads total receipts

  twenty years ago the average salary of
a good traffic-manager was ten thousand
dollars a year and of a general freight-
agent a little over half that sum exact
wage statistics of this sort are hard to get
at but it is safe to say that to-day there
are several traffic-managers who are draw-
ing more than twenty thousand dollars
annually and a fair number of general
freight-agents who get ten thousand and
over

  what must a man know in order to
fill either of these high places with credit


the inside of the freight department



to himself and with profit to his com-
pany let us first take up the traffic-
managers qualifications and duties and
then work down through the list of his
subordinates on whom he depends-those
who head his various sub-departments-
clear through to the station-agent out on
the firing-line for among these or their
employees are the traffic - managers and
general freight-agents of to-morrow

the busiest man

  one of the traffic-managers principal
duties is rate-making-a task that owing
to the ever-changing adjustments of trade
is never finished these rates cover prin-
cipally the transportation of goods up-
on his skill in fixing them so as to leave
a reasonable profit for the road and at
the same time stimulate business depends
to a great extent the prosperity of his
company

  every civilized human being has an
influence on the ebb and flow of the
freight business the adjustments of
trade to-day may be obsolete to-morrow
that is why the traffic-managers task of
rate-making is never finished

  even the president himself does not
keep as minute watch of the companys
total receipts and expenditures as does the
traffic-manager who also scrutinizes con-
tinually the total volume of traffic-how
it is made up how it fluctuates and what
its ever-changing and peculiar needs are

  he keeps in close touch with the head
of the operating department in regard
to the number and time of trains he
conducts the difficult negotiations with
the traffic-managers of other roads rela-
tive to through rates what percentage of
the revenue each road shall receive and
all other questions in regard to the inter-
change of traffic he must know the
conditions of every business and of all
markets and must work continually to
increase the traffic of his road

traffic-managers right arm

   to do all this the traffic-manager must
be a man of mature judgment he must
have clearness of perception firmness
consistency of purpose practical experi-
ence and a perfect familiarity with the
resources of the company if he is in-

competent no one can lose so much money
for a railroad in so little time

  it is the traffic-managers first lieuten-
ant the general freight-agent-his un-
derstudy in fact-on whom his success
depends to a considerable extent in cases
of necessity this official temporarily as-
sumes all the duties of the traffic-man-
ager in making rates and directing the
flow of traffic	

  the general freight-agents first duty
however personally and through his
subordinates is to get business for the
road and keep his competitors from ta-
king it away it has to be hunted out
and solicited precisely as other goods
are sold the competing sellers of
freight transportation however have a
little more handicap than the sellers of
merchandise for their prices are all the
same and they haveto depend on per-
sonality and service to get the business

a man of leisure

  in brief the principal routine duties
of the general freight-agent outside of
getting business are as follows he issues
regulations governing the transportation
of freight and the disposition of perish-
able property and high-class freight
he has to keep an eye out to see that there
is no laxity in the weighing and inspec-
tion of freight in transit over his line that
the cars are not overloaded so as to go
limping to the repair-shop in unusual
numbers

  he prescribes what classes of freight
shall and shall not be loaded together
how it shall be placed in or upon cars
how it shall be handled while in transit
and when it arrives at destination and
the disposition to be made of claims for
delay overcharge loss and damage fi-
nally he has to see that measures are rig-
idly enforced to insure-getting the freight
to its destination in the shortest possible
time after the railroad receives it from the
shipper

  issuing regulations and seeing that
they are enforced are parts of the gen-
eral freight-agents work that the pub-
lic sees little of to the many people
who call on him in the course of a day
he seems to be a man of abundant leis-
ure in which to discuss affairs

  the general freight-agent climbs up


the railroad mans magazine

to his place through a long list of sub-
ordinate offices he knows about the
weight and bulk of freight-perhaps be-
cause he long has handled it at some sta-
tion he is familiar through long ex-
perience with every fine point of the
freight classification

  he understands thoroughly the re-
sources of the country that is tributary
to the hundreds or thousands of miles
through which his road passes the strife
for business at junction or other com-
petitive points makes it imperative that
he shall know what his rivals are doing
so that none of them shall catch him
napping

men who get the freight

  connected with the general freight of-
fice when it is located in a large city
are a number of freight solicitors who
report either directly to that office or to
the heads of the branch offices which are
located at various strategic points
throughout the town these men are like
the city salesmen of a large mercantile
house wherever there is a possibility
of getting business they go after it

  if the newspapers mention the letting
of a big contract which will involve the
transportation of large quantities of ma-
terial they are at the contractors office
in the morning awaiting his arrival so
as to present the advantages of haying
the business transported over their line

  they have a wide acquaintance and
their work brings them in touch with
every class of industry and with all sorts
of people as all the competing railroads
are practically on an even basis as far as
rates are concerned the successful solic-
itor must be a man of pleasing per-
sonal it

  he must know how to interpret the
freight classification correctly and must
also be familiar not only with the rates
which it governs but also with a vast
number of commodity and special rates
like the commercial salesman he must
have a thorough- knowledge of the goods
he is selling and must make no mistakes
when quoting prices

  the salaries of these freight solicitors
vary according to their experience ac-
quaintance and efficiency a beginner
would not receive over  a month he

would be sent out at first to answer re-
quests for rates on specific classes of ship-
ments with the information carefully
prepared in advance and with instruc-
tions to refer any new inquiry to the of-
fice for further instructions

  by the time he had learned his job
thoroughly and was able to be trusted
to  run alone his salary would be
double that if he rose to be one of the
crack business getters in his department
he could doubtless command  a
month

  there are cases where freight solicitors
are paid as high as  a month but
they are men of exceptional talents in
that line and they generally become divi-
sion freight-agents when they are able
to command that salary

  a boy or a young man who wishes to
enter this branch of the freight depart-
ment-and by many it is considered one
of the best in which to acquire a knowl-
edge and experience that will be of great
service in securing future advancement-
should make his application to the divi-
sion freight-agent in the district in which
he is located the general freight-agent
except on very large systems where the
departments are minutely subdivided has
the hiring of the freight solicitors who
cover the city or section of the country
in which the general offices are located
these men report direct to his office ap-
plication for this employment should be
made by letter or in person to that official

the inside force

  but the soliciting end of a freight de-
partment while extremely important is
no more so than the great office forces-
the men who by letter and by record-book
carry on the work that the solicitors have
begun it is only a part of the detail to
secure the business once obtained it
must be looked after most carefully and
for this the railroad needs not only a large
but an able and energetic clerical force

  each freight department of a large
railroad though individual lines differ in
their planning is divided as regards-its
inside workings into approximately these
sub-departments the- freight tariff
bureau or rate department the freight
claim department the tracing depart-
ment and the overcharge department
the inside of the freight department



closely allied with these though not a
part of the freight department itself is
the car accountants office-a part of the
accounting department-which keeps
track of where the cars are

  how large these sub-departments are
may be realized from the records of one
of the large eastern railroads that has in
its main office twenty-five clerks in its
overcharge department alone forty
clerks in its rate department sixty to
seventy-five clerks in its freight claim
department and fifteen in its tracing
department-about one hundred and
fifty in all

makers of rates

  the titles of these departments are
largely self-explanatory each is pre-
sided over by a highly qualified executive
clerk and the claim department is gen-
erally so important that its head has his
name in the list of officials under the title
of freight claim-agent

  the freight tariff or rate bureau
has in direct charge the making up of all
the freight rates-those based on-the clas-
sification commodity rates special rates
local and through rates in the matter
of through rates however they furnish
only the data whicl is necessary for the
heads of the traffic department to de-
termine the basis on which they shall ad-
just the through charges and the propor-
tions thereof with the connecting lines
who participate in hauling the merchan-
dise

  whenever changes in through rates oc-
cur-and  that is always happening in
some part of the country-the rate de-
partment sees that its tariffs are adjusted
as quickly as possible to meet the changed
conditions the schedules of freight
rates that continually come from this of-
fice are passed upon by the general
freight-agent and by the traffic-mauager
before they are issued for use

  this department is in charge of a chief
clerk who is generally a member of the
freight tariff committees throughout the
country and has to keep in close touch
with them personally and by correspond-
ence rate making in the freight depart-
ment of a railroad is a science by itself
that takes the ablest man a number of
years to be classed as an expert

  it is a common saying that no one
ever learns it thoroughly the experts
however are among the best-paid men
iii the clerical force of the traffic de-
partment it is rare for them however
to rise to the higher executive positions

  the freight tariff bureaus head on
an important line will receive on the av-
erage  a month salary his chief
assistants will draw from  to  a
month those who do the routine work
will get the usual scale of clerical labor
according to their knowledge and effi-
ciency from  to  or a little over

  if mistakes and accidents never hap-
pened the freight claim department
would not exist but where there are
millions of individual shipments each year
-as there are on each of the great rail-
way systems-there must be a certain
proportion of errors out of which claims
arise the classes of freight claims are
loss damage and overcharge

  the number and amount of claims are
very great on even the best organized
line each one has to be carefully in-
vestigated which takes endless time and
patience

  shippers put in claims hastily in many
cases the consignee of a few pieces
of household goods for instance does not
receive them as promptly as he thinks he
should he concludes that they are lost
and writes the railroad company that
such is the case usually claiming a value
on the goods that is far in excess of what
they are worth

most interesting department

  the claim department puts a number
on his letter and replies asking for the
original bill of lading so they can make
investigation meantime the goods have
arrived and nothing more is heard
about it

  nevertheless on many roads this is
numbered and listed as a claim this
partly explains why the number of claims
per year on a large system will often pass
the hundred-thousand mark

  at best the adjustment of claims is
one of the most vexatious branches of
the service it is to the roads interest
to make prompt and full settlement of
every just claim but every claim must
be examined carefully before it is passed


the railroad mans magazine

  in a case such as that of the house-
hold goods if they had been really lost
or were received in a damaged condition
the railroad company would have to fol-
low up the matter step by step and ascer-
tain every particular as to where they
were lost and why or how much they
were damaged this investigation is nec-
essary in order to prevent the road from
being imposed upon and it is also neces-
sary to ascertain the cause of the mishap
for upon that may hinge something im-
portant concerning the efficiency of the
service

making of mail

  if the claim is for local traffic its
adjustment is comparatively simple but
if several other roads have handled the
merchandise before it was lost or de-
livered in a damaged condition to the
consignee it becomes a complex matter
to fix the blame and the result is seem-
ingly endless correspondence caused by
the making of innumerable inquiries
occasionally a single claim-file will con-
tain no less than two thousand separate
letters and documents before it is finally
settled

  paid or rejected it must be however
as quickly as the methodical investiga-
tion is finished and the efforts of most
railroads are in the direction of investi-
gating claims to their conclusion with the
utmost despatch otherwise their busi-
ness is likely to suffer

  in the freight claim department
where the overcharge department is a
distinct organization the chiefs job is
worth from  to  as a general
thing his assistant will draw from 
to  there will be a few employees
at  but the most of them will get
from  up for the clerical work

the simple side of it

  overcharge claims are more easily ad-
justed than those for loss and damage
they outnumber the loss and damage
claims many times

  these overcharge claims arise in this
way there is an enormous number of
rates that an agent even at the smallest
station has to try to master

  if he charges too low a rate on the
way-bill it is the custom of some roads

to recharge the difference between that
and the right rate back on the unfortunate
agent if he is not able to collect this
undercharge from the shipper or con-
signee he has to pay it out of his own
pocket

   therefore in order to obviate this the
agent takes the safe side and charges the
highest rate that he thinks the traffic will
bear and an overcharge results if the
receiving agent does not detect it-and
he has so much to do that he generally
does not-the error is caught usually
when the copy of the way-bill is revised
in the general office

  frequently the consignee receives no-
tice that there is money due him on ac-
count of an overcharge in rate before
he knows it himself large customers of
the railways however usually keep a
rate clerk of their own and send in their
claims as quickly as the errors are found

  the overcharge departments scale of
salaries is not quite so high as the freight
claim departments because it handles al-
most solely questions of fact and not
those involving long investigation nice-
ties of judgment or discretion the chief
of this division receives about  a
month and has a number of expert rate
clerks who draw from  to  a
month each the lesser salaries run
about the same as those in the claim office

sherlock holmes bureau

  when a shipper thinks his goods are
slow in reaching destination he writes
or calls up the freight department on the
telephone and asks them to start a tracer
after them the tracing department
forthwith proceeds to do so by first as-
certaining the number of the car in which
the shipment was made and other details
and then writing or wiring each division
point between point of origin and des-
tination the car numbers are checked
at each point and the receiving agent is
also communicated with

  if in the case of less than car-load
shipments the car in which the goods
were shipped reaches the destination of
the merchandise being traced minus the
goods several things may have happened
to account for the loss the goods may
have been stolen-which is rare-or they
may have been hastily unloaded with
the inside of  he freight department



 other goods bearing marks that resembled
 theirs in the lantern light again they
 may have been overlooked and carried
 lar beyond their destination thus becom-
 ing astray freight

    it is the business of the tracing de-
 partment to find out what became of the
 goods if possible if it cannot and the
 goods have disappeared then its file be-
 comes the basis of settlement in the
 freight claim department in the regular
 order of things

   frequently where one or more car-
 loads of perishable or much needed
 freight is being hurried through the ship-
 per requests the railway to trace by wire
 the tracing department thereupon re-
 ceives reports from all the division points
 of the passage of the car or cars and
 keeps the consignee and consignor ad-
 vised of their progress if it is so desired
 this obviates the cars being delayed in
 transit except by extraordinary causes

   the tracing departments chief execu-
 tive is on about the same salary basis
 as the head of the overcharge depart-
 ment aside from his principal assist-
 ant however the average of salaries in
  this department is between  and 
 a month the principal qualification is
 care and exactness in keeping the multi-
 tude of records straight

the man of figures

   the car accountants office is the
 one upon which the freight department
 depends for essential information regard-
 ing the movement of its merchandise and
 the location of the supply of empty cars
 the car accountant is advised daily by
 agents and conductors of the location
 and use of each car on the line whether
 it is loaded or empty in good or bad
 order

   his work is one of immense routine
 and requires the utmost exactitude on
 the part of every member of his large
 staff of clerks without the car ac-
 countants aid the freight department
 especially would be almost helpless

   the car accountant is paid  to
  a month and even more on a big
 system his principal aides get prob-
 ably - and  a month

    the bulk of the work is purely clerical
 the entering up in great books of endless

car numbers the going over of thousands
of reports each day it is the kind of
drudgery that work of that sort cannot
escape being and there are more salaries
of  and  a month paid in this de-
partment than those over 

  away from the general office of the
railway in almost every large city on its
own line and in practically every city
in-the united states from which it may
hope to draw freight traffic for a greater
or less proportion of the through haul
are its district or division freight-agents
each of these keeps informed of the
traffic conditions at each point in his
territory

the feelers of the service

  fie has to know the producers and
merchants of each town in his district
the kind and quantity of the merchandise
shipped and received by them he watches
the fluctuations in shipments to see wheth-
er a decrease in their amount is caused
by decreased demand ill-adjusted rates
inadequate facilities for reaching mar-
kets or whether they are being diverted
over competing lines	

  the division freight-agent located on
the line of his own road keeps in close
touch with the station-agents on his divi-
sion he advises the general freight-
agent of traffic situation in his particular
district and of any need for rate adjust-
ments to meet changing conditions

  these district or division agents ac-
cording to the importance of the terri-
tory in which they are situated have a
clerical staff and force of solicitors to
drum up business for the road they
are of great importance to the freight
department and their ranks are most
frequently recruited from the most able
of the freight solicitors or from the large
number of station-agents on the line

  a position of this sort pays from 
a month up according to the importance
of the territory that has to be looked
after

  the boy or man who wishes to secure
a place in any of these divisions of the
general freight department should or-
dinarily apply to the head of the division
either personally or by letter- in either
case stating his qualifications and refer-
ences as briefly as possible


the railroad mans magazine

  if he is a stenographer the chances
for quick employment and more rapid
advancement are much increased for
the applicant who is inexperienced there
is nothing to do except to begin among
the bottom rounds of the ladder to master
his own duties first and then to learn
all he can of what the work is that is
going on about him

the open door

  a youth of eighteen or twenty is re-
garded as the most desirable timber in
these minor places for if he has the right
stuff in him he learns quickly and is
ready for promotion when it offers the
rule in all railroads is to fill vacancies
by promotion from positions next in line
-providing of course the man next be-
low is competent

  the aspirant for a place in the general
freight office itself should address him-
self to the head of that department the
run of salaries there for ordinary labor
is about the same as it is in the subor-
dinate divisions the general freight-
agents chief clerk will receive  to
 a month

  there are of course one or more as-
sistant general freight-agents whose sal-
aries run from  a month up but
these high positions naturally are filled
by men of long years of service and wide
experience

  if an application is made personally
the applicant will doubtless be asked to
write a letter detailing his qualifications
so that it may be placed on file it is
often the belief that this request is but
a convenient excuse for getting rid of
him

importance of the agent

  this is not so these letters of ap-
plication are carefully classified as they
are filed and whenever a vacancy occurs
that cannot be filled from the staff in the
office they are taken out and gone over
most scrupulously vacancies of this sort
do not occur every day therefore the
applicant may hear nothing of -his letter
for weeks or months before he is asked
to call

  every station-agent on a railway is an
indirect employee of the freight depart-

ment-one of its great mainstays in
fact he gets small pay usually but at
the smaller competitive points especially
where the road has no other representa-
tive he can do much toward increasing
his lines business

  if he is a better hustler than his com-
petitor the volume of freight from his
station steadily increases until some day
there is a vacancy at a more important
station or in a higher post in another
department and he is promoted

  most station-agents start in as tele-
graph operators in fact it is the rule
that at small stations the agent shall know
telegraphy a station of this sort where
one man does all the work pays 
a month on the average

  at larger stations where there are day
and night operators a car clerk etc the
pay will run from  to  a month
the latter figure is well up toward the
top of the scale

the road to fame

  as has been said a knowledge of tel-
egraphy is one of the most frequent step-
ping-stones to the station-agents place
there are many schools that teach tel-
egraphy and it can also be studied at
home the superintendent of telegraph
is frequently called upon to send men to
fill these minor agencies

  an operator desiring to become a sta-
tion-agent would do well to file his appli-
cation with that official and also with the
general superintendent or whichever of
his assistants in the operating depart-
ment lias charge of appointing agents
the custom varies on different roads

  aspirants-young men especially-
who have had no experience and desire
to enter the railway service by this door
should apply to the station-agent in their
own town if he has an office force the
smallest position is usually that of station-
messenger which will pay perhaps 
or  a month

  but there is always an opportunity for
the youth who wishes to learn to become
familiar with the station routine and with
telegraphy as well it will be encour-
aging for him to remember that probably
more railway officials from presidents
down started in as station-agents and
operators than as anything else

yacht before mr sand in fact it just
so happened that you turned up to char-
ter her just as all hands were about to be
paid off most of them were in fact

   harding  mused philip

   yes said pearce laughing  ill tell
you something more this miss harding
whom you brought aboard with you is-is

a relation of the owner perhaps thats
why there were prompt searching orders

   m-m-m-m  hummed philip

  pie thought he began to understand
he remembered that when miss harding
said she knew the chameleon and that
she had sailed on her as a guest of mer-
ton scragg he had been filled with the
conviction that scragg was not the own-
ers name but that the real name had a
familiar sound though he could not re-
call it harding of course it was
and should have been familiar

  but where did merton scragg come
in miss harding had said that she had
sailed on the chameleon  as a guest of
merton scragg she could hardly sail
as a guest of her relative frederick
harding where did merton scragg
come in

  then a light dawned on philips mind
the yacht had been given up just when
he chartered it miss harding had dis-
tinctly stated that scragg was the owner
of it the ghost of miss sharpes warn-
ing voice came up in the conversation
there was something here which was not
to be discussed but philip thought he un-
derstood

  miss hardings father had fallen into
the hands of the skinflint scragg scragg
was the owner of the yacht-by a mort-
gage perhaps just as he was owner of
philip sand body and soul yet-miss
harding had distinctly stated that her
father was rich

  however the matter was of too deli-
cate a nature for discussion with captain
pearce philip gave the order for the
run to new york saying that the mat-

began in the october  r a  ro a i mans magazine single copies  cents




the railroad mans magazine

ter of further orders would be discussed
later

   how about the treasure mr sand

   im tired of treasure said philip
wearily

  and indeed a new mood had come
upon him it seemed that the adventure
was over and that no future adventure
could be as pleasant or as sweet now
that miss harding was safe and was
about to be restored to her proper envi-
ronment the bottom had fallen out of so
many things that philip was quite dis-
heartened

  nevertheless despite his determination
to freeze her back into her shell of re-
serve he spent many hours of the pre-
cious three days with her one day he
kept away from her altogether but after
dinnerin the evening he could stand it
no longer he sought her out where she
sat abaft the funnel he sank into a
chair by her side and was silent

   philip she said suddenly it was
the first time she had called him by his
christian name since coming off in the
boat from the island  philip after you
leave me at new york what are you go-
ing to do 

  for a moment he was dumb the
question had come so abruptly it was
so terse and pointed it covered the
whole problem over which his heart and
mind had been battling

  when i leave you at new york
he echoed

  yes she said quietly

  he was somehow disappointed at her
quiet acceptance of the necessity but it
was necessity

   what am i going to do  

   yes you are going to do something
of course

  her tone jarred him- it was so unlike
her

    does it really interest you to know 
he asked

   philip-you know it does and he
was sorry on the instant

   well i chartered this yacht to hunt
treasure he said having found the
treasure and having time to kill before
time kills me i suppose i shall have to
find other mischief for my idle hands
to do

  what like

   trade for instance take cargoes

and deliver them and get more cargoes
and amass money and give it to the sail-
ors to spend i might have a string-
orchestra aboard to liven the men as they
load up with coconuts or logwood
theres lots of things i can and will do
 philip she said gravely  you are
in a very bad frame of mind i under-
stand and sympathize thoroughly but
listen to me i want you to do something
-to do something for me

  he sat up turned around and caught
her hand

   verina he said hoarsely  you know
that there is nothing i would not do for
you tell me what to do for you and
i will indeed have something to do-
something it will be a joy to do

   it is a very simple thing philip i
want you to say good-by to me at new
york believing that all may yet be well
-for you then i want you to sail
right out to the open sea and stay there
you once spoke of filibustering and tra-
ding and you said something just now
about cargoes go and do these things
philip forget your illness forget
everything-

   well if it will help you think of me
sometimes and know that my prayer is
that you may grow strong and well that
is all i want philip will you do this
for me 

  i will verina said he but what
good will it do 

   i think it will do lots of good re-
member i saw you when you came aboard
the revuelan you did not know that i
saw you  but i did and i have thought
of it since-since you told me you were
ill i remember now that you looked just
a little bit pale and languid but you are
not that now you look brown and sin-
ewy and strong and-and- she sud-
denly bent forward and took one of his
hands in both of hers  philip she
whispered tensely  i dont want you to
die you mustnt die you must fight to
live because it means much to me

   i understand he said  thank
you-and god bless you  

  he lay back in his chair quite happy
for the moment then the lean fantom
of merton scragg arose before him
merton scragg even if he did get well
there was the mortgage

  then his heart leaped everything in
treasure of the world



his body responded to the fighting call
he would get well he would make
money to buy back his life he had less
than eleven months to make twenty
thousand dollars plus interest in that
time was no small task for a man with
 particular or special ability but he
had the yacht and he had optimism and
determination  and there was a prize to
be his if he won health and twenty thou-
sand dollars-verina

  and after that he said

   after that  she echoed very softly
 let us speak of that-then you will
come to me-come to see me for i must
know if my doctoring is better than my
cooking and i am sure it is you will
come to me at the end of the year and
tell me how it has gone with you philip

i will be waiting to look into your face
and know that you are well and strong
he understood all that she did not say
his eyeswere filled with tears and his
throat thick with tenderness he took
one of her hands gently and almost rev-
erentially kissed the finger-tips

   i will try-i will try so hard i
will fight 

   good  she said bravely and the
little fingers closed tightly over his hand
to-morrow then i shall be in new
york i will leave you my address you
are not to leave the yacht as soon as
you have said-good-by to me-i know
my way home surely-you will about-
ship as you salt-water people say and
heave away  the raging main good
night philip you have been very good
-better than any man i ever knew you
know that i feel that dont you

   verina he said  i know every word
that you would say and you know what
is in my heart good night dear 

  you may come in  cried verina
philip entered the cabin she stood in
the middle of the little room and the
sunlight shone through the port out-
side tugboats shrieked and big liners
growled close by a ferry - house bell
clanged and a great river castle slid
slowly out across the stream

  verina was dressed in the height of
fashion the yacht had been but an
hour in port but in that time a young
woman had come aboard with two suit-
cases and a bandbox and now verina

harding was again arrayed as a sweet
american girl in summer costume

  as philip entered she held out a card
to him

   put that away safely until the time
comes when you want to find me she
said

  he took the card mechanically he
was looking at her with the eyes of loves
worship she laughed happily

   do i look like a castaway on a des-
ert island   she inquired archly

   you are the dearest woman in the
world-and the best loved   said he

  philip she said reproachfully we
mustnt go as far as that he noticed
the  we it was advice not reproach

   i suppose you are right you are
right he said

  then there was silence

   i am ready now she said at last
there was a little quiver in her words
 good-by philip

   good - by he said brokenly he
stood away from her with his hands
hanging helplessly at his side

  for a moment she looked then her eyes
filled with tears in another moment she
was in his arms

   philip philip   she whispered
 what fools we are not to say what is
in our hearts you are the best and no-
blest thing in my life dont think i am
sending you away i want to make you
well and strong again so that we can be
happy always and-philip-if it is not
to be remember this i love you and i
will wait-oh i will be patient and so
must you because we must pay for our
happiness

  he drew her close to him

   yes perhaps we have been foolish
he said  now you have made me hap-
py i love you dear-love you the more
because i cannot have you but i will
go away and fight-oh i shall fight so
hard for it is not my happiness only it
is yours now i must win 

  you shall she whispered drawing
away from him

  he opened the door for her she
reached out her hand and pushed it back
again it was then as she stood looking
her last upon him that he noticed a
string of pearls around her neck

    my fishing-line he said huskily

   yes kiss me    good-by


the railroad mans magazine

  he would have followed her to the
deck but she said  no then the door
closed and he was alone he looked out
of the port-hole the sun-ray was slant-
ing across the cabin the air breathed
of her late presence a fresh red rose lay
upon the pillow where she had slept he
took it up tenderly and touched his lips
with it

    i must find a way back to life he
said to the rose

     chapter xvi
     the doctors sentence

a little less than eleven months
after philip sand said good-by to
verina harding the yacht chameleon
steamed into new york harbor

   philip himself stood on the bridge be-
side captain pearce and looked eagerly
at the tall buildings and the shipping and
the palisades ahead

  verinas advice had been good at
least it had been well meant and of
course she had not known of that other
complication philip had obeyed her in-
junction to the letter he had manfully
fought for life he had been a trader
among the caribbean islands he had
been a filibuster around the honduran
ports he had been a smuggler between
curasao margarita and venezuela he
had steadfastly refused to think of his
misfortune

  he had dreamed night and day he
had allowed himself to think that all
things were possible and especially he
had taken for accomplished the paying
oft of the mortgage on his life and his
marriage to verina harding

   dreaming hard is half the battle in
life dreaming hard is optimism refined
-the belief that a-thing shall be some
people say that half the efficacy of prayer
is the desire of good-the recording of
wishes with the belief that they will be
fulfilled

   in philips case dreaming hard seemed
to have achieved much any man who
saw him immediately thought  what
a fine physique  and indeed he looked
the embodiment of health strength and
vigor

   he had little fear however of lauris-
tons verdict his mind was filled with

that other difficulty-merton scragg and
the twenty thousand dollars for philip
was a man of honor he had played his
cards and if he had lost he was not go-
ing to cry mercy of his opponent

   but there was a bitter pill-the bitter
pill of many a mans life he had had
the twenty thousand dollars-the neces-
sary amount to buy his life back-and he
had lost it at first he had traded in
any old thing-logwood coconuts ba-
nanas and other island produce he had
run the gantlet with firearms disguised
as  bedsteads and lima - beans he
had entered into anything and everything
that promised life and interest in life

   and because he cared little and rushed
into things with a gamblers spirit he
had won he had made money

  then came-that last and greatest risk
-when he had invested his earned twenty
thousand dollars in a venture-and lost

   to the treasure in the channel he had
paid no attention he had had enough
of the treasure perhaps some of the su-
perstitious talk which he had hurled at
the heads of howells and his men had
rebounded upon his own senses perhaps
his dream of what happened to all who
had owned that treasure-and what to
his own knowledge had happened to its
last owners-jhad deterred or driven from
his mind the idea of raising it

   his first thought had been to win back
that treasure against which all treasures
of the world are as dross-life to keep
in the open air to buoy his own interest
in life to forget the why and wherefore
of his struggle and just live--these con-
stituted the commandments of his creed

  and as money began to pour into his
coffers he had realized chucklingly that
taking care of his life meant taking care
of its wherewithal thereafter he had
thought even less of scragg and the mort-
gage the first thing was health per-
haps he had won that or very nearly as
he had won back the twenty thousand
dollars-or very nearly

   but  very nearly  in this case meant
not at all he had lost his money and
whether he had gained health or not to-
morrow must see him dead unless some
unforeseen thing happened to show him
a way out of his difficulty 

   not for a moment did he think of cry-
ing off his bargain although the sweet
treasure of the world



ties of life were beckoning him from the
path of honor it would be easy enough
to say to scragg 

   i am well and you can do your worst
no court would uphold your infamous
stipulation

  yet no stipulation had been made he
remembered that distinctly he remem-
bered merton scraggs words when he
sought to specify the stipulation himself

   mr sand merton scragg had said
 i think we have said enough

  it was understood and it was as clear-
ly part of the contract as if it had been
set  paper signed and sealed by both
parties in the presence of witnesses and
no part of the transaction was on paper
save that philip had willed scragg his
entire property which at the present mo-
ment consisted of a few hundred dollars
some old books fifty thousand dollars in
insurance and a faded red rose

  yet philip had not given up hope he
believed that scragg was a human being
at least and he had heard stories of the
mans private life which although
strangely at variance vtith the popular
idea of the man might be true

  it should be understood however that
philip had no intention of going to
scragg and crying mercy of the bargain
he was not of that sort he had made
the bargain with his eyes open he had
taken and enjoyed the mans money-and
he had enjoyed it now being a gentle-
man a sportsman and a man of refined
honor he was not going to cry peccavi

  but he would go to merton scragg and
tell him of the treasure at least he
would ascertain scraggs attitude and it
was just possible that thirty days grace
might be forthcoming if so what might
he not do in thirty days  he might raise
the golden ingots and pay off the twenty
thousand dollars with interest

  but of course everything depended
upon lauristons verdict if he was not
cured of the disease there would be little
use in clutching at a straw to prolong
life he had enjoyed his year he had
tasted love life travel and adventure
if the end were merely to be deferred
then-why not now why not fulfil his
bargain with honor and a smile

  there were a thousand possibilities
one thought which recurred despite his
hatred of it was the fact that verina

harding loved him and that she was
rich if he married her- he put the
thought away repeatedly yet it had a
peculiarly insistent way of coming back
again and again

  a man of less refined instincts and a
less rigid code of morals would have lin-
gered at least over the thought of mar-
rying her and borrowing twenty thou-
sand dollars he decided to think 
more of anything until he had seen lau-
riston

  a hour later he was at the physicians
office the waiting-room was filled and
philip had to wait for some time there
was a secretary-a pretty young woman-
whose business was to note the patients
as they entered and this young woman
kept the physician in his inner sanctum
duly notified of the arrivals most of
them she knew by name but philip
seemed a stranger to her although he
nodded as he entered and addressed her
by name

  as he sat there in the waiting-room
reading a magazine six months old he
was conscious that the secretary was
studying him she had seen him before
but- he might be a stranger and
strangers were not encouraged unless they
came by appointment finally she arose
and came over to him

   you are mr-

   sand-philip sand have you for-
gotten me miss armstrong 

   why mr sand i confess i had
you have been away-so long and-you
are looking so-changed

  a moment later she was whispering
into the telephone presently in walked
lauriston the next patient arose to
take precedence but lauriston smiled
and said

   excuse me miss hollis i have an
urgent appointment with a gentleman
here whom i overlooked yesterday i am
sure you wont mind waiting a few min-
utes

  all the time his eyes were upon philip
and his face expressed astonishment

   come this way mr sand he said

  the physician presently closed the in-
ner door of the sanctum behind him for
once the reserved gloomy doctor was al-
most human

   upon my word  sand you are mar-
velous but there   he warned  dont


the railroad mans magazine

get your hopes up in the air you never
can tell peel off your clothes i want
to listen

  philip smilingly stripped lauriston
watched him curiously - noted the full
expanse of chest and the sun-tanned col-
lar above the breast-bones there was a
queer light in the physicians eyes as he
came toward the patient with the stetho-
scope dangling from the back of his ears

  for a moment he looked down into the
clear eyes of the man whom he had prac-
tically condemned to death then he
grunted and adjusted the y-shaped tubes

   take a long breath said he  say
ah now whisper  ninety-nine 

  there was silence after philip obeyed
the instructions presently lugubrious
larry took the stethoscope from his ears
laid them on the table and walked up
and down the room for a half-minute
then he faced philip with an unbeliev-
ing light in his eyes

   sand said he  if i did not know
to the contrary and any man told me
that you had ever had anything the mat-
ter with your lungs-i should say that he
was a blatant ass you are as sound as
a bell

  philip took the physicians outstretched
hand mechanically his heart was beat-
ing fiercely joyously rapidly he was
thinking of verina harding and the fu-
ture then like a fantom arose the
specter of shylock

chapter xvii

a womans claim

 n hour later history as if repeating
itself brought philip sand to the
park  and once more he found himself
seated on a bench watching the tame
ducks sailing about the pond the chil-
dren feeding them with broken crackers
and the self-conscious policeman twirling
his locust on his wrist-thong

  a year had passed-a year all but a
day-and the year was like the day that
it wanted so many things had happened
while the trees had lost their foliage
while the ducks had squawked in their
winter quarters while the pond had
frozen over

  he put his right hand into his left
breast-pocket and slowly drew forth a

card should he see her no he should
not yet while his conscience was tell-
ing him what was best for him and for
her his heart was anticipating the meet-
ing

  to see her again all he had to do
was to start now and in half an hour he
would be facing her-verina harding-
looking into her eyes-into the eyes of
verina harding he must not go yet
already he was going

   there must be some way out he
said to himself  perhaps i should have
told her that even if i got better i had
to reckon with scragg but i never
dreamed that i would be as sound as a
bell thats pretty sound and there is
no reason on earth save one why i
shouldnt live a long honorable hon-
ored and prosperous life only - by
noon to-morrow i must either be dead or
ready with twenty thousand dollars plus
interest

  he tried to figure out just how much
interest was due and it came to him sud-
denly that there had been no interest
spoken of or to be strict about the
matter the interest was to be one hundred
and fifty per cent merton scragg was
to get fifty thousand dollars in return
for his loaned twenty thousand dollars
of course the old skinflint had not reck-
oned  getting a mans life on top of
that but if scragg was really a siy-
lock he would demand his money or his
life the latter alternative meant life
first and money afterward

   well said philip with a sudden
glowing of his blood  maybe verina can
tell me im going to see her just for
that reason to tell her all about it-to
ask her advice then he added to him-
self in a still small voice  philip you
are a liar you are going to see her be-
cause you must

  the address took him to a quiet part
of the unromantic bronx the house was
an old colonial thing half hidden among
trees around its environs brick tene-
ments-very new ones-were squeezing
up it was typical of the bronx-yes-
terday and to-morrow hugging each other

  there was a broken-down wall with
a wooden gate set in the middle of it
the gate whined asphilip swung it open
and advanced up a grass - grown path
before the old house there was a stump


treasure of the world



of what must have been at one time a
magnificent tree around this stump was
a bench and on the bench sat verina
sewing

  she lifted her eyes as he came up her
face turned pale then she stood up and
awaited him with a glorious expression
about her mouth he took off his hat
and walked in the air toward her his
eyes never leaving her face

   i am here said he quietly he had
not known how his feelings would greet
her

  she held out her hand

   and i was right- she began her
speech breaking off as if there was some-
thing which she wished to add but was
afraid to

   were you going to call me  mr
sand   he asked

   no-philip

   thank you  shall we talk here 

   no she said still with her eyes on
his face his brow his neck his shoulders
-roaming over him  come in

  as in a dream she turned and walked
up the rickety old steps he followed
only conscious that it was she-verina
his eyes were enchanted by the beautiful
figure the dear familiar head and hair
and the sudden reality of her face

  she entered a dim hall he close at her
heels she turned and shut the door in
which were two panels of crimson glass
the light fell rich and ruddy upon her
as she faced him

   philip  she whispered and her eyes
filled

   my beloved  he said

  then he remembered-that is present-
ly she took him into a big old-fash-
ioned drawing-room and drew him down
to a seat beside her

   now what is the story

   verina he said slowly and earnest-
ly  i think i am worse off than ever
you see i did not tell you everything
i-

   first tell me she cried  what did
the doctor say  

   pie says im-im-as sound as a
bell said philip wondering how he was
tc come to the point without hurting her

   then nothing matters  she whis-
pered jubilantly

   no-that makes my position worse
he said  i have a confession to make

i never thought that this was possible
or-

  then he told her at first her face
expressed amusement then amazement
then alarm then terror

   but-but -she stammered- this
is-absurd  i never heard of anything
so absurd you are not going to die
how are you to die between now and to-
morrow noon if-if god doesnt will it
so

  philip groaned  but i took his
money he managed to say

   pay it back she said sharply

    i cant said he lamely  i couldnt
pay back a tenth of it i lost every-
thing

   then let me lend it to you i have
plenty

  philip shook his head emphatically

   then -and her words camc very
slowly very searehingly- what are you
going to do-as a man of honor

  philip was silent lie dared not look
at her let alone speak he knew that
she understood presently she got up
and walked about the room

   philip she said softly and thought-
fully  i do not think this is a time for
pretense you know that i love you and
i have never doubted your love is not
your love big enough to surmount petty
things 

   i do not understand you he said

   loving one another was it not un-
derstood as love is always understood
that when obstacles were cleared away we
should marry  

   this is worse than the treasure i
couldnt enjoy said philip

  she stopped in front of him her
hands were lightly clasped before her
her eyes were slightly downcast and her
face crimson but she had decided the
question and she meant to be brave about
the matter

   philip will you marry me-to-day 
she said	 

  for a moment the room seemed to whirl
about his head he only saw her beauti-
ful and womanly in her confusion of bra-
very he longed to take her in his arms
and hold her close-very close

  presently he understood but his heart
was torn between the natural demand of
the life-loving creature and the so-called
honor of ethic-bound custom


the railroad mans magazine

   verina he almost moaned  dont
tempt me

   i am not tempting you i am not
trying - altogether trying to solve your
difficulty i am fighting for myself
philip-fighting for my love your life
is not your own-not since that night on
the island i dont think any mans life
is ever quite his own somebody loves
him i love you philip and our lives
are as one if you take your own life it
is murdering me

   i cannot take your money to-to save
myself i could never be happy

  she began to walk about rapidly and
nervously she toyed with papers orna-
ments and other things in an absent kind
of way then she turned to something
else that momentarily attracted her whirl-
ing mind she understood his horror of
marrying her that he might pay off the
shylock she honored him too for his
reluctance but she herself had some
views on the subject

    philip she said with her face avert-
ed  i am not good at expressing what
is in my heart-in my mind perhaps it
is because i am so much in earnest but
listen dear

    i am listening verina he said husk-
ily

   i gave you my happiness-i gave it
into your keeping when i let you know
that i cared perhaps i should not have
let you know perhaps you should not
have let me know but it was my fault

i loved you and i dont know how it
camq about i forgot for a moment that
the woman should wait but-i forgot
-and you were so brave and-i loved
you so much

  never mind that dear said philip

 i was weak and- but we were hap-
py he added lifting a haggard face to
hers

   yes we were happy i have been
happy all the year-waiting philip i
prayed - morning and night - for you
it was just a foolish little prayer but it
was all i could make up perhaps be-
cause i was so much in earnest i said
often and often-in the street here in the
garden anywhere -  god maka philip
well again that was all and i felt that
he would and you see he did

  there was silence in the room philip
could not speak and she was trying to

find once more the lost thread of her
argument

   i gave you my happiness-my life-
when i gave you my hpart philip hu-
man beings-especially i think a man
and a woman when they love one another
-are peculiarly bound up together i
can understand why you did what you
did-a year ago that is if you thought
you were going to die

   but you see how things have turned
out you are not going to die but you
owe a man twenty thousand dollars just
because you promised that you would be
dead

    but since then philip you have made
a graver mistake you have given me
your life-your love perhaps you had
no right to do it but perhaps i stole it
and so stole your life

    it wont do us any help to talk about
that philip she went on  we cant
understand these things but it justshows
you that you have no right to barter that
which is in the hands of fate the
wrong was in bartering even a shattered
life for money

    i wouldnt have met you if i hadnt
said philip without looking up

  that was fate said verina  we
cant alter decrees of fate philip but
sometimes we can right what we have
done wrong most of the acts of human
hands can be undone by human hands
why cant we undo this

   i cant take your money he reit-
erated  i could no more sell myself
to you than buy you verina

  she stamped her foot  who speaks
of buying and selling she cried angri-
ly  look at me philip  

  he lifted his head as she had com-
manded she was standing erect with
her chin slightly lifted her lips were
quivering and two tears were perilously
near the corners of her eyes

    verina  he said helplessly

    i know you didnt mean it she said
 but listen to me if there is talk about
buying and selling let me say something
about taking and stealing and defraud-
ing if you pursue this foolish-no i
shall not say foolish for i understand
your position-but if you refuse to let me
rescue you what will be the result is
your life not mine

   does my happiness count for noth-
treasure of the world



ing are you going to place the ficti-
tious value of so - called honor in the
scales with my love my life and my hap-
piness dont you understand me

   but how am i to do this consistently
with honor - so-called or fictitious
asked philip  remember it is the only
honor i have and-i took and spent the
mans money

   i can write a check for twenty thou-
sand dollars and never miss it  she
cried  and i could not let you go out
of my life quite as easily

  he winced-for two reasons he knew
that her direct statement was only uttered
because it was no time for pretense he
knew that she was talking the sheerest
kind of common sense but her writing
that check- he winced

   i cannot do it he said doggedly

   philip  she cried and her strong
attitude seemed to melt like wax she
dropped on her knees at his feet and
clung to him fler voice came to him in
incoherent pleadings

   i cannot do it that way he said
 but you mustnt give up yet little
woman i recognize with you that this
thing must be adjusted somehow there
must be a way put your way aside
dear and let us think of something else
in a little while she got up and sat be-
side him

   well she said  what do you wish
to say-what is your plan

   listen he said  there is one
chance i took this mans money if i
had nothing to offer him but a plea for
mercy i should not go near him  but i
believe i have something to offer him
if he would give me thirty days grace
i might get that treasure

  he will cried verina i am
sure he will oh philip if you could-
go to him-to-day-at once if he is a
human being at all he will understand
tell him about me tell him i have
money but you wont take it let me
come with you if i ask him-

   wait a minute said philip smiling
at her eagerness the trouble is the
man if he is a human being at all he
will as you say agree but it has always
been a question whether merton scragg
is a human being or not

  who she exclaimed

   merton scragg

   	rr

   is that the man who- she had
arisen to her feet and was staring down
at him his face white and agitated

   why yes said philip puzzled
 merton scragg-- hes the man

   mer-ton scragg she said hardly
above a tense agonized whisper

  for a moment she seemed like a woman
turned to cold marble then she dropped
upon her knees and buried her face in hei
hands

       chapter xviii
       his pound of flesh

hilip let her be he sat near her
staring and wondering was it pos-
sible there were two merton scraggs-
one the skinflint shylock who was willing
-to trade even upon a mans life who
never -spent a penny on luxury who
grudged seventeen minutes for his lunch-
eon of coffee and buns who hoarded
every dollar like a miser the other a
man who owned a private yacht and put
to sea at intervals with guests of the class
and refinement to which verina harding
undoubtedly belonged 

  the suspicion was growing in philips
mind that the merton scragg of verinas
acquaintance was identical with the mer-
ton scragg of his own and her present
behavior suggested that perhaps there
were two sides to this merton scragg
although philip was positive that scragg
was not the name of the owner of the
chameleon-or at least that it was not
the name as he had learned it from the
agents and from captain pearce he could
not drive from his mind the fact that
verina herself had positively declared
that it was  mr merton scraggs yacht

  she had recognized the chameleon
too when it sailed into the cave at caicos
island and philip remembered also
the peculiar recognition between captain
pearce and verina harding when the
party came off from the island

   of course nothing of all this proved
the identity of one merton scragg with
another but pearce had said that the
owners name was frederick harding as
the agents had philip remembered ve-
rina had said it was merton scragg and
now at the mention of the mans name
she had sunk by the sofa and her quiver-


the railroad mans magazine

ing shoulders were betraying some strange
inward emotional struggle there was
a tangle here

  what had this beautiful refined woman
to do with the lean hungry-jawed shy-
lock of wall street philip had some-
times wondered he had often regretted
that he had not asked her directly but
his policy had been to discourage inti-
macy between her and himself so that
the forgetting-the seemingly mandatory
forgetting-might be the easier when the
seemingly inevitable time came

  but as verina had said the time for
pretense was past they two were hope-
lessly bound up in each other the
crisis had come and her present behavior
could not be passed over unexplained

   verina he said  tell me one thing
who is your merton scragg and what is
he to you  

  a few minutes passed in silence she
arose to her feet and stood by the window
with her back to him presently she
turned her face to him in her eyes was
an expression of bright hope despite her
tears and her pallor

   philip she said  i believe fate-
or god-is being good to us in a mys-
terious way i cannot tell you every-
thing but merton scragg is my fathers
closest-i will not say dearest-friend
merton scragg is a peculiar man-a man
whom few people understand he is a
hard man in business-a merciless man

   but my father is his best friend al-
though my father is under obligation to
him it might be that in a case of this
sort my fathers influence would have no
effect upon mr scragg but i am going
to try what my father and i can do to in-
fluence him he is i think very fond of
me-i mean merton scragg i believe
i am the only person in the world that
he truly loves

  philips heart grew heavy again it
seemed that his life lay in the hands of
verina harding he thought he saw the
position her father was under scraggs
thumb probably more securely than the
daughter dreamed it might even be that
the spider made playthings of the father
and daughter who fondly imagined that
they had some influence over the old
tiger yes    she had been on
the chameleon as a guest of merton
scragg

  her pleasure was the pleasure of the
man of steel in time he might tire of
it now would be a test of the genuine-
ness of his affection-if he really had any
-for the flardings

   well   said philip monotonously
he had little hope or cheer in his heart

   i know what you are thinking she
said  you are remembering what the
world thinks of mr scragg you have
heard that he is mean mercenary and
merciless but there is another side to
that man philip and i have seen it per-
haps you will see it too

   it is now one oclock philip you
have time to go to his office in wall
street put the case clearly before him
you need not speak of me if you do not
wish to tell him about the treasure
you have the ruby pin and i will give
you the string of pearls ask him to
give you time

  talk business to him and then come
back to me- come to-morrow morning
you have done much to-day-and so have
i whatever the result is think well to-
night and come to me to-morrow morn-
ing

   i see he said  you are determined
to save me some way or other i am to
owe you my life

   i am fighting for my own she reit-
erated i am trying to rouse in you
that sense of honor of which you are so
proud

   very well said philip  but before
i let you make a sacrifice for me i wish
to help myself will you promise that
you will not speak to your father or com-
municate with merton scragg-at least
until i have seen him and received his
answer 

   i promise she said holding out her
hand  good-by just now philip go
quickly for time is precious

  a few minutes later he was going down-
town as he went he puzzled much  but
mainly over the fact that verina had been
very cool in her parting with him she
was a strange woman in some ways he
reflected he remembered how cold-
blooded she had seemed aboard the cha-
meleon when she had said  wihat are
you going to do after i leave you at new
york

  and now- but perhaps her seeming
cold-bloodedness was merely cool-blood-
treasure of the world



edness in emergency some women are
like that

  merton seraggs chief clerk looked
curiously at philip as the visiting-card
recalled the young mans identity he
hurried into his employers private office
and as hurriedly came out again

    mr scragg says will you step in at
once sir  said the chief clerk

  the iron-faced rigid man received
philip with a repelling stare

   be seated mr sand  am groping
in my mind for the reason of this unex-
pected visit said he coldly

   i have not come to ask any favor
philip said a little warmly  i merely
wish to put you in possession of certain
facts which might bring you regret if you
discovered them after-

   exactly said merton scragg  you
find that your bargain was a rash one
you have found life of more importance
than money mr sand you have come
to put me in possession of certain facts
which may carry so much responsibility
that the burden of the affair will rest
upon me

   i will not permit you mr scragg-
began philip hotly but the lean raw-
boned financier waved his hand impa-
tiently

   one moment  he snapped  i have
not finished if you object to what i may
say in my own office you have the right
to leave it i bear no ill feeling toward
you sir but i wish to freshen your mem-
ory

   a year ago you came to me and bor-
rowed twenty thousand dollars upon your
insurance policies assuring me that the
best specialist in the city had given you
only a year to live i expressly asked
you-three times i think-what security
would be mine against the contingency of
your not dying we did not go into pain-
ful details but you assured me that yoli
would be dead i warned you mr sand
that life was sweet-even to an old man
like myself-neither blessed with youth
great health or popularity

    after consideration i loaned you the
money for i understood tlie position in
which you were placed to me it was a
perfectly legitimate transaction more
than that i perceived that i might be
doing some good in making the last year
of your life pleasant

   you will recall that it was i who
objected to your placing the understood
stipulation upon paper not because as i
perhaps led you to think that i realized
the incriminating nature of such a doc-
ument but because i foresaw that if by
any chance you regained your health or
tired of your bargain you would come
begging at the end of three hundred and
sixty-five days-as you have done 

   you are quite in error mr scragg
said philip his coolness regained al-
though his heart was like molten lead
 my honor has suffered none at the pros-
pect of death to-morrow i-

   that is what i supposed at the time
-that you were a man of strict honor-
as your father was before you said
scragg but his eyes were fixed curiously
on the young mans face and he was
thinking of philips last words so the
voung man contemplated suicide after
all

   had i come to the end of the allotted
days with no hope of continued life
said philip  or without the means or
any prospect of paying back to you the
money which i borrowed on my life i
should not be here as it is i am here
to make a proposition which you are at
liberty to accept or decline without any
further discussion of it

  you overlook one point mr sand
said scragg with forbidding iciness  i
must either accept any proposition you
may make or take upon my shoulders the
guilt of what a moral world might call
by an ugly name-murder mr sand
philip knew that this was a truth he
hung his head and there was silence
broken only by the tapping of merton
scraggs lean fingers on the clesk-top

   but said the miser  you may pro-
ceed mr sand for possibly your prop-
osition may be such that i may be able to
accept it i assure you that no matter
what you may know or think of my char-
acter i should be very pleased to dodge
a painful issue all i want is-my pound
of flesh mr sand the man smiled al-
most pathetically  you see he added
 i have a reputation to sustain in wall
street now let me hear what you have
to propose

   i ask for thirty days grace said
philip  and for an extension of one
month in my charter of the yacht chame-


the railroad mans magazine

leon which i have every reason to be-
lieve is your property

  merton scragg glanced quickly at the
younger man but he betrayed nothing of
the effect the remark may have had upon
him when he spoke his tone was as
icily severe and quite as businesslike as
ever

   there is nothing to warrant your rea-
son or belief that i am thfe owner of the
chameleon he stated  i am however
a personal friend of her owner mr
harding-mr frederick harding to
whom i believe you are indebted for
your rescue but for my acquaintance
with mr harding i should find it rather
difficult to understand what you are talk-
ing about a chameleon i believe is a
lizard that changes color with circum-
stances there are human chameleons
mr sand he added with the ghost of a
smile

  philip hardly heard the sarcasm he
was thinking over that matter of the
yachts ownership he began to see
light verinas father he remembered
was  under obligation  to mr scragg
plarding was probably the owner but
only in name

  the chameleon and perhaps all of
hardings worldly goods were mortgaged
to merton scragg the skinflint admit-
ted an acquaintance the fact that ve-
rina had been a  guest  of scragg did
not necessarily mean that the wall street
shylock had ever been the host in bodily
presence yes it was verinas way of
expressing a bitter truth and - miss
sharpe had uttered her warning  ve-
rina 	

   why dont you marry the girl   was
scraggs way of breaking the stillness that
had fallen in the skinflints office

  for a moment the silence seemed inten-
sified philip could hardly believe his
ears what had the man just said

   why dont i marry the girl   he
echoed marry-what girl

  for a moment the disloyal thought came
to him that verina had-perhaps out of
sheer desperation and the desire to save
him-broken her promise

   hardings daughter said scragg
looking at him keenly  she has plenty
of money to marry her would seem
poetic justice after the romance of the
island there is some poetry in my life

mr sand also it would be a solution
of your difficulties

   i have no intention of making use of
any womans love or any womans money
as a way out of my obligations said
philip coldly  how did you know-
of all this 

  merton scragg picked up an afternoon
newspaper in bold liead-lines on the
front page philip saw the words

revuelan-foundered-
survivors

   pearce has leaked - as usual was
philips inward reflection well he
said to scragg

  for a moment shylock regarded the
younger man searchingly

   the world expects it of course said
he incisively why not

   mr scragg said philip loftily  i
have nothing to say on the subject ex-
cept what i have already said that i
cannot consider taking the advantage of-
fered me

   docs the girl fancy you inquired
scragg bluntly-almost coarsely

   that said philip sharply  is none
of your business and i shall trouble you
to keep the matter off your mercenary
tongue

  scragg merely smiled  very well
said he  you will not blame me if i de-
mand a pound of flesh from your own re-
sources when you so carelessly flout what
providence offers you what was your
proposition 

   my proposition said philip  en-
tails a revisal of that story he indi-
cated the newspaper article and proceed-
ed to tell the tale of the wreck the
landing the treasure and all that fol-
lowed

  scragg listened with an impassive face
although once when philip spoke of the
retreat from the golden hut his eyes
brightened and he looked at sand

   you gave up a fabulous treasure for
the sake of-a woman   he queried curi-
ously

  philip ignored the remark and contin-
ued his tale  the treasure he con-
cluded  lies in that channel i could
almost mark off the spot on a chart all
i need is thirty days the yacht and a
diver or two
treasure of the world



     i see said scragg finally  you do
  not wish to die mr sand

    for the life of him philip could not
  make out whether the man was uttering
  a sarcasm or not the financiers face
  was immobile only his eyes glowed with
  a peculiar flame

     i do not confessed philip   not
  because i am afraid to die although i
  would prefer that i could die naturally
  but life has taken a new meaning from
  circumstances will you grant my re-
  quest 

   merton scragg tapped on the table
 with his fingers and lookell keenly
through the window at the tops of the
citys buildings presently he said 

     i will be frank with you mr sand
  i put no faith in treasure schemes i
  have never heard of a treasure expedition
  which found treasure except in cheap lit-
  erature also i cannot give you the
  yacht you had better see mr frederick
  harding on that point

    if he consents then-i will consider
 the matter in fact you have placed me
 in such a position that i dare not with-
 hold my consent i feared that it would
 come to this you-

     one moment mr scragg protested
 philip  i will not listen to any such
 talk i have not come to beg if your
 common sense-if your decency does not
 urge you to see the wisdom of my course
 then i can leave this office now and the
 rest-remains with me

     then go said scragg coolly  you
 should not have come to me it is none
 of my business but you have until noon
 to-morrow you can do as you please
 because i have no power over you thanks
 to myself

     you can obtain the yacht and sail in
  defiance of me and what is due me but
  i am loath to be responsible for your
  death-directly responsible when it is in
  my power to present you with your life
  at a cos of twenty thousand dollars to
  myself i have worked hard mr sand
  for every penny i have

     i value my rights they are all a
 man has in a world that cannot or will
 not live without money battle he
 stopped abruptly presently he waved his
 hand

     go now young man you have until
 noon to-morrow but before you do any-

thing rash-call me on the telephone it
might be that i may yet agree to be
robbed

       chapter xix
       the debt is paid

tdhilip awoke next morning with a
a headache strictly speaking he did
not awake he merely opened his eyes
looked at his watch and decided that the
day had sufficiently advanced for him to
get up and run the last lap of human af-
fairs

  he had not slept his mind had trav-
eled down the oiled groove of the line of
least resistance-the descent of which is
so easy and so uncontrollable once the
mind has been launched upon it

  and it was so easy the solution of
the difficulty was so broad and simple and
inviting and the point of honor involved
so delicate so thin so imperceptible to
all but the finer sort of soul

  all night he had dreamed of merton
scraggs own words-as if shylock were
the tempting devil himself

   you can do as you please because i
have no power over you thanks to my-
self you can obtain the yacht and sail
in defiance of me and what is due me

  it was a strong temptation - just to
take french leave for thirty days regain
the treasure pay scragg his twenty thou-
sand dollars plus a liberal interest and
probably in the end the skinflint would
be better pleased at present scragg only
feared for his money-his investment

  and that was just where the blood of
old philander sand arose in rebellion
the house of sand had made its quon-
dam fortune by methods unquestionable
the name of philander sand on paper
made that paper as a bond

  the pride of sand arose in arms against
any subterfuge in the payment of a note
fallen due true it was for everybodys
best interest that thirty days grace should
be granted but the holder of that fig-
urative note wanted his money and the
principle of philander sand whispered in
philips heart-blood

   you backed the note my son you
must pay the fiddler

  he dressed - wearily his eyelids
seemed to be filled with grittiness his


the railroad mans magazine

lips were sticky as if he had been drink-
ing sweet wines the night before his
temples were hot and his senses were
strangely dulled

  he could think no more he cared no
more he was just sorry-sorry for him-
self sorry that he had ever visited mer-
ton scragg sorry for verina but too tired
of mental debating to feel any great pang

  to-day was - the day of execution
this was the three hundred and sixty-
fifth day at noon the matter must be
settled for good and all there was no
doubt in his mind that it would be set-
tled-one way or another if it was not
settled one way it would be settled-
the other way

  he looked at his watch it was eight
oclock the watch was ticking with mo-
notonous regularity so many ticks and
it would be nine-ten-eleven-noon
then it would be all over and-the watch
would still be ticking whether the little
timekeeper in his own breast was still or
not

  he had three hopes left and surely one
of them would save the situation scragg
might relent of his own volition-philip
was determined that he should not again
apply for extension verina might de-
vise some scheme even if he himself did
not accept her money as a thirty days
loan-his mind revolted even at that and
the third chance was the one which is
ever present in the most precarious of sit-
uations-the something which may turn
up

  one queer idea came into his head it
did not seem queer at first-indeed it
seemed perfectly feasible and sensible
he might go to some acquaintance-and
he had a few who were moneyed men-
and tell him the story of the treasure
borrowing twenty thousand dollars plus
interest on the enterprise which would
see the gold raised and converted into
cash but who would believe his tale of
the mortgage on his life even if he told
it and he felt that he had no right to
reveal that which was merton scraggs
secret as well as his own

  merton scragg had served him while
serving himself it would be dishonor-
able to tell of the transaction just because
he himself was sorry for his side of the
bargain

  and if he did not reveal the reason for

haste it was hardly likely that in a few
hours he could convince even an intimate
acquaintance that the treasure story was
true and get twenty thousand dollars on
its vague promise

  when lie was ready for the street
philip paused a moment to plan his ac-
tions first he must see verina and tell
her of his interview with merton scragg
then he must see verinas father and
ask him for the loan of his yacht if he
got it lie must then telephone merton
scragg and- perhaps the miser would
agree

  but scragg would probably yield he
had said that he would be loath to be re-
sponsible for philips death he had
said that he might agree to be robbed
philips pride was struggling within him
he was questioning his right to place
scragg in the position of  permitting
himself to be robbed -and that was how
scragg felt about it the only other
course was to fulfil his bargain and-be-
fore noon

   anyhow i have four hours said
philip to himself in the glass he looked
a little pale but far from being a suitable
subject for an undertaker  i will see
verina i owe it to her and i promised

  the truth that was knocking at his
heart was this

   i am a drowning man i love life
i am weak if she offers me a straw
though i may not clutch at it i would
like to feel that it is within my reach

  when he arrived at the house in the
bronx he was a little disappointed that
verina did not at once see him the
housekeeper an elderly woman with an
aggrieved face said that she was dress-
ing adding the gratuitous remark that it
was still very early in the day

  philip was hurt there were some
things about verina he could not under-
stand wras she so selfish that she could
not appreciate how precious every minute
of that forenoon must be to philip if not
to her was it possible that her men-
tality was of that sort which moves
around only one thing at one time the
kind that weeps at the tragedy and for-
gets at the curtain

  she kept him fully half an hour then
she came into the room with her hand
outstretched in a formal welcome

   i pray you will accept my apology
treasure of the world



for this untimely call said philip with
just a tinge of reproach and bitterness

    i had ftot expected you so earl she
said coolly  well what did mr scragg
say 

  her tone was so cool and indifferent
that philip felt wounded to his very soul

   are you-are you really interested
to know   he asked laboriously

    philip she said with a smile  you
are a very foolish boy perhaps you will
soon know just how much interested i am
and have been in your behalf

   you have not spoken to your father
or to merton scragg

  to mr scragg-no i promised you
i would not when my father came to
dinner last night i said i wished to have
a long talk with him in the study i told
him

   and-

   he is at home to-day and i think it
would be better if you and he talked it
over together fie is very sympathetic
philip

    i am glad of that said philip dazed-
ly  i need some help-from a man i
would like to talk to him

   but what of scragg 

   scragg i am afraid the man is im-
possible there is not a grain of senti-
ment in his composition i made matters
worse by going to him he treated me as
if i were a beggar i will admit that he
left the matter open for consideration
but his decision even at its favorable best
will be a hard nut for me to swallow fie
told me that your father verina owned
the chameleon and that- by the way
you told me merton scragg owned it

   my father owns it said verina sim-
ply

  there came a sound of footsteps creak-
ing on an old wooden staircase over the
hall the door of the drawing-room pres-
ently opened and merton scragg stood in
the portal

   philip said verina tremulously
 this is my father do you see now how
good god has been to us

  philip sat down on a chair and stared
at the figure in the doorway

   mr scragg said he although the
face of the man was cast in a softer more
human mold than that of the tiger of
wall street he might have been
scraggs twin brother

   no mr sand said the old man gen-
tly  my name is frederick harding-
here 

  it took a few seconds for the last word
to sink into philips dazed intelligence
then it all came back to him in a vivid
flashlight panorama merton scragg was
frederick harding frederick flarding
was merton scragg yet the two men
were as different as cheese and chocolate

  there was some one kneeling by phil-
ips side a little warm hand was trem-
bling in his and a little voice was whis-
pering 

   philip - philip its all right
everythings all right dont you under-
stand 

  philip did-partly but he could say
nothing he was trying to identify the
white-haired thin-faced old gentleman in
the doorway with the gaunt iron-jawed
shylock of the wall street office

   philip sand said frederick hard-
ing  this is my house and when a
guest is introduced to his host i believe
custom requires that he stand up even if
he does not shake hands shake hands
my boy

  philip got up he was conscious that
he was being led forward by some one
who held his left hand fi is right hand
he extended mechanically still with his
eyes fixed on the kind eyes of verinas
father

   listen to me young man said hard-
ing in a paternal way  you neednt
think your wits have deserted you you
are not seeing ghosts i am merton
scragg right enough but not here i
am taking a holiday to-day-the first i
have taken in years barring sundays

   you are one of the few men who
know my secret down there  - he
frowned- i am what i am-a man of
business fighting for the peace and hap-
piness which i keep locked up here up
here i am frederick harding-merton
scragg is the only amusement i ever per-
mitted myself in business-and my little
girl aild i are very happy together

  a kind of jekyll and hyde stam-
mered philip

   not exactly laughed the old gen-
tleman  but  think i know what you
mean everybody is more or less of a
jekyll and hyde or a harding rfnd
scragg the only difference in my case


the railroad mans magazine

is that i am a creature of pronounced
views

   my business is my business and i am
what my business has compelled many a
man to be - a hardened fighter with
mercy to none and asking no quarter
my private life is what i think a mans
private life should be-something devoid
of the miseries of the outside world

   sit down my boy said he smiling
still  miss harding he added with
mock severity  i did not ask you to sit
down beside him

  there was a long pause the old man
was regarding the young people with a
sad but happy smile

   i am very pleased with you two
philip my little girl told me last night
that she loved you very much i know
that you love her i knew it yesterday in
my-in mr scraggs office you see i
had been reading the newspapers be-
sides that i heard your story eleven
months ago when my little girl was re-
stored to me and so he said curious-
ly  you let the blackguards take away a
million in gold for the sake of - a
woman 

  philip started a little it was as if he
was in scraggs office again only the
scragg who stood before him was very
strangely transformed now he under-
stood it all

   but t owe you twenty thousand dol-
lars said philip stupidly

   no you dont said frederick hard-
ing quietly  your debts are paid in
full i did not bargain for your life my
boy i bargained for your money all
you have in the world is fifty thousand
dollars in insurance and i believe that
by your will it belongs to me

   i have given that will to my daugh-
ter to whom i presume it would naturally
be your intention to leave your earthly
possessions you see young man i in-
sist upon your marrying my daughter
propriety demands it

  philip stared at the old man then
his eyes slowly filled with tears he
could not utter a word but the little hand
stole back into his and nestled there as-
suringly harding knowing that which
takes the iron out of a mans self-control
went on talking tactfully

   i admire your pride philip i ad-

the

mire still more your manhood and your
sense of honor i could have found it in
my heart to tell you everything in the
office yesterday when you told me to keep
the matter of your love-affair off my mer-
cenary tongue my heart was made hap-
py right there the man who could re-
sist a beautiful woman and her money
when his life was at stake is-the kind of
man i would like to see my little girls
husband

    the yacht by the way is mr hard-
ings and as you have his permission to
use it perhaps you might go treasure-
hunting around that island you cant
have too-much money in this world my
boy but nobody knows better thanyou
that it isnt everything verina tells me
that she would like to go back and get
the breadfruit out of the fire

   for a moment philip was at a loss to
interpret this queer speech but suddenly
it dawned upon him the yacht was his
shylock was satisfied his life was his
verina was his plealth was his now
he was to go treasure-hunting again with
verina to help him find it with verina to
help him roast breadfruit on that partic-
ular hilltop

   he held out his hand in silence he
was too happy to utter a word through
a haze he saw shylock with an amused
contented smile on his rugged face and
heard his voice say

   now i must get down-town all
play and no work makes a fool of jack

  ten minutes later merton scragg was
traveling down-town in the street-car line
which he owned the conductor taking
the fares passed by the man who picked
up a castaway newspaper and became im-
mersed in it

   back in the old colonial house which
was hedged in by new tenements philip
sand was staring before him there was
a woman on her knees before him and
her face was buried in his hands pres-
ently an old grandfathers clock in some
other part of the house began to dole out
the long-drawn strokes of the noon-hour
philip sand started

    verina  he exclaimed

    philip she whispered and her arms
stole up around his shoulders  kiss
me-but dont say anything for a little
while

a woman at the key

by eva m richards

we find women in every phase of commercial life nowadays-even in
railroading but miss richards who spent some time as operating
express-agent and in other capacities in a little way-station out
west advises women to keep out of that part of the game and she gives
some pretty good reasons why when she started in she was satisfied to be
a mere cog in a great system but she made herself more useful than orna-
mental and soon became a lady pooh-bah in her little sphere

thrilling experiences of a young woman who did most everything
from feeding a wrecked crew to chasing boes
down the

ft had always been my wish to be
part of the great wheel of
business i had studied tel-
egraphy a short time and had
 had a short experience in sta-
tion work but when i was
offered the position of station-agent and
telegraph-operator at a small station on
the chicago and north-western railway
i promptly accepted

no queen on her throne was ever hap-
pier than i when i first wrote my name
as agent for the company and i pity
him who has never felt the exhilaration
of responsibility

doing business over ones own signa-
ture is quite a different matter from doing
it over anothers but strength and cour-
age are generally near us when we are
in need of them and they have never
failed me

except the clerical work in the general
offices there is no branch of railroad work
for which a woman is physically fitted
the reasons are numerous the long
uncertain hours exposure to climatic
changes strain on the nervous system
and the necessity of always being ready
to stand ones ground in the face of un-
expected and most difficult circumstances

                                 dusty pike




the railroad mans magazine

   ready for an emergency  prepared
for the unexpected should be brand-
ed on every would-be railway employee
hardly a day passes that does not bring
some unthought-of proposition when one
acts without hesitation

  the station in which i was installed as
agent and operator was in a small town
but being the shipping-point for a rich
stock and agricultural district it was a
busy point and i soon became well ac-
quainted

multitudinous duties

  when it was possible i hired a man or
boy to attend to the outside work but
more often this was impossible then i
surely did the work of a man

  in the years i associated with railway
men they treated me with the greatest re-
spect and i can truly say of them that
they are a class of men with big hearts
and always ready to do a kindness

  i was also postmistress and express-
agent so had my fingers on the keys of
the towns government express and rail-
way business at seven in the morning
i was due at the office when i sent
my first report to the division train-des-
patcher and from then until the last train
at night no-matter how late my work was
before me

   an agent of such a station cannot be the
steel figure of the city pie must not only
be polite but neighborly with the towns-
people and those from the country every
newcomer must be gracefully welcomed
and every old one honored

  the admonition of the photographed to
 look pleasant  is always needed by the
agent one old lady who took the train
quite frequently at this station often
asked me to make a cup of tea for her
she usually arrived at the station at least
five hours before train-time and when
she was not drinking my tea and eating
crackers she was knitting socks and smo-
king an extremely odoriferous corn-cob
pipe

private secretary to farmers

  after the telephones were installed
throughout the country i acted as private
secretary to most every shipper in that
country i was often called upon t write

an order for harness or similar articles for
a farmer these orders usually came just
about train - time the shippers appre-
ciated this assistance because there was no
charge they appreciated my efforts for
them though they never deluged me with
storms of gratitude

  of all the mail which i handled i
think the following  forward as the
writer called it merits a place in english
literature i was asked -by the writer to
 look it over hence my knowledge of
the contents

    my der gurl this fur all rite seems
  a age sence i see yer be back sun as pus-
  ible yer own lover a rite more nex
  time so gud-by little blue ies and pink
  teth-you no what that lin is a agin

  i presume the line stood for an affec-
tionate demonstration of his ardent af-
fections and  a agin  meant that he
was still a and not an alligator

  shipping a first consignment has been
to some people their waterloo i dis-
tinctly remember a horse that was brought
to the station for shipment the con-
signer had never shipped an ounce of
freight in his life and was duly excited
about the performance

milk for the crew

  the box car was not right in front of
the stock-chute so i told him to push it
there with the aid of the pinch-bar this
he refused to do and insisted upon load-
ing from the depot he improvised a
bridge by laying boards from the platform
to the car then led the horse up the steps
into the car i going before coaxing the
animal with an ear of corn

  it has often been necessary for me to
stand on boxes in order to seal cars and
i have moved empty cars with the aid of
the pinch-bar there is little work about
a station that i have not done even to
dodging hoboes

  one evening the freight was coming
down the line running on a smooth stretch
of track when without any apparent
cause three of the loaded cars were off
the track lying on their sides these
cars were loaded with shelled corn so the
spill may be easily pictured

  the conductor and brakemen were in
the  lookout  at the time and graphic-
a woman at the key



his bark and growl compensated for his lack of size

ally told me they found themselves at the
other end of the caboose on their faces
but expected to be in paradise

  the crew came to the station to report
and asked if i could furnish them supper
my sister said we could but when she
went to the ice-chest to see if there was
sufficient milk and cream she found the
same condition that confronted mother
hubbard

a  x  dog

  seeing a herd of cows grazing by the
roadside i called a boy to get us the nec-
essary supply he did his best for us
but found it difficult as it was fly-time
and i think he did most of the milking
walking about the lane with the cows
after supper the crew went back to work
and i sat at my desk taking and sending
orders until the next day my sister kept
me company occupying an improvised
couch of empty egg-cases

  all the time i was in this office i had a
most ardent admirer and protector in
jack my one-by-two dog his bark and
growl compensated for his lack of size
and he frightened more than one weary
willie by attaching himself to a trouser-
leg

  one willie came into the office and
with a savage cast of face said   that
dog bit me and now i will have cholera-
morbus rabies

  jack was very fond of the trains and
crews much to my discomfort until an
engineer sent a great cloud of steam at
him and a conductor pulled his tail

  from that time if he was lying on the
platform and heard a whistle five miles
away he would run for his life into the
office many is the way-bill he has torn
into bits for me one in particular which
covered a shipment from la crosse go-
ing into the office i found the little fellow
sitting in the ticket-windovv having a fine
time throwing bits of pink paper about
not an inch of the bill was left

  i wrote to the agent at la crosse ask-
ing for a duplicate and when i received
it across its face in bold letters was writ-
ten   either tie up your dog or give him
to a circus

one lantern-two globes

  the passing of a circus through our
town at two in the morning from platte-
ville to cedar rapids iowa gave me my
first experience in blocking trains my
station was not a regular train-order


the railroad mans magazine

office consequently  had no sema-
phores or other devices with which to
give signals save one lantern and two
globes one red and one white but
these did the work satisfactorily

  very few persons realize the respon-
sibility that is connected with the opera-
tion of trains they enjoy the excellence
of the service from the ballast road-bed
to the electric-lighted padded berth they
frequently notice the whistling of the en-
gine and the stopping of the train but

enough to express the tortures through
which i passed when i received my first
train order had it not been for the
kindness of that conductor i too might
have piped my swan song i have the
original yet which reads

 baraboo-to c  e no  n

   no one hundred twenty-five 
  murphey can have until eleven forty
   am to go to ipswich against
  no one hundred twenty  reales
  no  gets this at ipswich 

                                   j yv l

there never was a county fair without them

what this means they do not know but
the men at the telegraph key and the
throttle know

  a small sheet of yellow tissue paper
is an insignificant looking article but
upon it depends the safety of lives as they
span rivers cross prairies and crawl up
mountainsides this yellow sheet con-
tains the train orders which govern the
movement of a train and which is the
young operators test of ability and
courage-and often his swan song

  a rule appears simple until we at-
tempt to harness and put it into use
so it is with learning about train orders
and the delivery of such

  i have never found words strong

  after the delivery of that order i
 felt that i would succumb to nervous
 prostration

when mckinley died

   i hold copies of three messages which
 i received and which were but three
 of thousands of the same nature received
 on the same dates they are as follows

                            baraboo 

 to alt agents 

   thursday sept   has been
 appointed a day of mourning and
 prayer you will please issue such in-
 structions to those under your jurisdic-
 tion as will result in as complete cessa-
 tion from labor as practical
a woman at the key



    switching crews and station help will
  be reduced to a man and every em-
  ployee of this company is to be given
  an opportunity to comply with the proc-
  lamation of the president

                           baraboo is

 to all agents

   thursday september  having been
  appointed memorial day account of
  death of president mckinley we will
  abandon all way-freights and other
  freights as much as possible except for
  the handling of perishable freight and
  live stock notify all concerned

                             j w l

                           baraboo 

 to all agents 

   all trains and engines of this com-
  pany will come to a full stop at 
  pm to-day and will not resume motion
  until  pm or five minutes as a
  mark of respect to the dead president
  this is to be done regardless of where
  the train may be operators will please
  leave the wires silent during these five
  minutes	j- w l

 during these five minutes my wires
were silent and looking up the track we
could see the motionless passenger-train
which had just left the station i do
not remember seeing a smile on the face
of arailroad man during that sad week
my chicago daily paper reached me at
eight in the morning and every morn-
ing of that week i read it aloud to the
section men and neighbors as they gath-
ered in the depot and every day we grew
sadder and sadder

off for a picnic

   if one has never seen a crowd of peo-
ple board a train for the county fair he
has missed one of the best bits of human
comedy the crowd gathers from all
parts of the country-old men and wom-
en young mothers carrying little bundles
of life carefully wrapped in shawls
youthful lovers and their girls on their
first trip away from home the little
girl with a rubber cutting her little throat
in order to keep her hat on the back of
her head the growing boy with the
small felt hat turned up to give a good
view of his freckles and old young men
known as sports who are regular attend-
ants at every fair

   these old chaps usually wear a bright

tie a rubber collar large enough for
two necks a stiff hat on the side of the
head and a ring bearing a stone the size
of a quarter-of-a-dollar their clothes
are of goodly proportions and fit the
frame as if thrown at it their shoes
are of a perfect dust color

   these captains of leisure usually carry
either a cane or whip there was never
a county fair without them

  when they come straggling from the
train at night it is a different crowd
they are weary worn and sometimes
sad they are dirty crumpled and for-
lorn but they have been to the county
fair seen the big pumpkin and bet on
the races

its work we love

  to one unaccustomed to the clocklike
routine of railroad work the charm
which attends it is unknown but to
one who has received a  g n or relief
from duty who tunes his ear to the
heavy whistle of an approaching train or
the resounding clang of the bell feels
the irresistibility of the charm

  there is nothing more welcome than
a delayed train one for which one has
waited hours the trains on the divi-
sion on which i was employed were
more often late than  time during the
winter despite the snow-fences which
hugged the right-of-way the snow would
persist in filling the numerous cuts mak-
ing progress slow sometimes impossible
until the plows and dangers would make
their missionary visits

  at such times the most welcome thing
on the face of the earth was the train
and i held its engine in deep esteem as
it came puffing in its light piercing
the gloaming its long black plume of
smoke waving in the keen air its back
blanketed with snow and its flanks
fringed with icicles

  when it stopped it seemed to breathe
heavily and then to sigh then with re-
newed strength with its drivers silhou-
etted in the red light of the open furnace
it snorted and moved on

  then i banked my fire for the night
reported the train received  g n cut
out the wire locked the door and hurried
home tired and happy until the dawn of
another dav
the song of the wires

         by otis m sisson

       written for the railroad mans magazine

         heres a message of death on the wires to-

    i	night

         for they ceaselessly throb and moan

         p for they ceaselessly mourn like a soul that is
                    lost

    in a quavering minor tone

      far off in the darkness t hear it come

         faint and soft it sounds

      nearer it speeds with the pulsing beat
         of a wrought hearts leaps and bounds

    it comes like a shriek from the depths of space

        a quivering anguished cry-

      oh surely some soul is forever lost

        and forever alone must fly

      it goes like the sigh of a parting breeze

        and dies like a sigh away

      but to return in the rising gusts
         the saddest of sad chords- play

      theres a message of death on the wires to-night-
         hark how they sob and moan

      and a soul somewhere in the farthest space
         is winging its way-alone
dugans pal goes dippy

             by augustus wittfeld

                                  e florence

          the book-agent tries to get in a few words
          during the recital of archies love - affair

igr y friend said the book-
agent to dugan  i
i irw  would like to interest
ljvwl you in a work that
should be in the hands
of every thinker a
work that will raise your standard of
efficiency no matter what your calling
may be

   say sport replied dugan  no
doubt you have sincere convictions as to
the value of your indispensable work for
the brooklike flow of your language
would lead me to infer that you have at
least mastered your circular letter of in-
structions but when you speak of stand-
ard of efficiency i would like to inform
you that old man hinchman looks out
for that and the man that cant keep
the gage prognosticating a plethora of
steam gets ample time for the rigors of
social requirement

  true replied the book-agent but
do you never aspire for a more exalted
position than the one you are now fill-
ing ambition should be implanted in
every human breast and every man
should endeavor to prepare himself for
advancement

   right you are assented dugan
 but you dont for the infinitesimal sub-
division of the unit of time imagine that
i dont know anything but coal-heaving

   why man its not knowledge but
opportunity that i am laying for its
true im feeding fuel to a mogul now
but im ready to tackle any job along
the line-clean up to the presidency of
the road

 are there never times when you wish
to refresh your memory on matters of a

technical nature inquired the book-
agent  the composition of the coal
you handle the expansive power of steam
the mechanical construction of the steam-
gage or even the principle of the balance
escapement of your watch are all sub-
jects of absorbing interest

   speaking of watches said dugan
 reminds me of archie bruxton and so
long as you show a predilection for tell-
ing me all you know i am going to re-
late this yarn to you it may not be of
material benefit to you but its recital
may in a sense compensate you for the
loss of an order

   archie gravitated to railroading by
divine instinct back in the eighties at
which time i was swinging the scoop on
the pennsy he was an innocent-looking
chap with a caffy-o-lay complexion and
an unalloyed confidence in mankind

   he was unsoiled by contact with the
world and was preeminently a child of
nature

   i cottoned to him at the start on ac-
count of his unsophisticatedness and in-
troduced him to the medusa who ran the
waldorf where i kept my steamer-trunk
 by reference to medusa in this sub-
lime work interrupted the book-agent
 you will learn that the name was ap-
plied to mary queen of scots -  the
gentle medusa 

  yes commented dugan but this
medusa was  queen of the micks like-
wise not gentle well to continue-one
evening archie went out for a stroll and
when he returned he proudly exhibited a
pawn-ticket for a watch which he said he
had bought from a stranded railroad en-
gineer




the railroad mans magazitte

   i uttered mental maledictions when
he told me the story which is as old as
the hills and cussed myself for letting
him loose in the night air without a nurse
instinctively i knew that some one had
handed him a prize specimen of the citrus
vulgaris

   he said he thought that a watch
which was good enough for a railroad
engineer must be a pretty good article at
timekeeping and thats just what the
party of the second part expected him to
think but you couldnt expect archie to
be wise to the wiles of the pawnbrokers
runner

   are you aware of the origin of the
pawnbrokers insignia again inter-
rupted the book-agent  by reference
to the proper subject in this mine of in-
formation you will learn that the three
balls are the arms of the medici family
and refer to the exploit of averardo de
medici a commander under charle-
magne who slew the giant mugello
whose mace was fitted with three iron
balls

   sport replied dugan  you may be
long on medieval history but the accept-
ed interpretation of the sign of the three
brass balls is that it was the emblem of
the first pawnbroker-he who traveled in
the wake of the crusaders advancing
loans on their watches and scarf-pins
and whose motto was  in hock signo
vinces 

  the book-agent attempted to dispute
this explanation of the erudite fireman
but dugan threw the gab-throttle over
and shot ahead

    now see here pardner he cau-
tioned  if youre going to throw a switch
every few minutes and run this fiction
limited onto a siding well never finish
on schedule

well to get back on the main line
archie redeemed the watch the next day
by separating himself from eight forty
he showed it to me that night in the
cy of our boudoir

 it was one of those swiss movement
affairs reposing in a gold-filled round-
house highly ornamented with bizarre
engravings as i sprung open the lid
i was surprised to see the picture of a
handsome heroine gazing soulfully at me

    say boy i asked  whos vour lady
friend

   archie blushed like a girl caught in
the act of concealing her age

    the picture was in the watch when
i got it he replied

    shes a beauty all right i com-
mented  i wonder who she is

    wish i knew said archie soulfully

    see here kid i cautioned  dont
you go getting spongy on a fictitious fe-
male you are too young to indulge in
affinities or soul-mates 

   the article on affinities in this mag-
nificent work interrupted the book-
agent  abound in reference to the cele-
brated affinities of history-

   hold on protested dugan  i
aint interested i aint no blooming
monastic abelard nor no pugilistic paris
when a man does his love-making in the
spotlight you can bet your sesterces that
the divorce court is getting ready for ex-
ecutive session

   i warned archie to be careful in
diagnosing his symptoms told him that
the symptoms of love and a predispo-
sition to hepatic disturbance were often
confounded he protested that he was
heart whole but like the lad- he did
protest too much  and i realized that he
was squarely hit

   during the days ihat followed i
caught him frequently gazing at the
photo of his inamorata as though it was
a twenty-dollar gold piece

   one day he came home and told me
that he had run across the buccaneer who
had sold him the ticket this time he
happened to be a stranded sailor who
had smuggled in some diamonds which
he wanted tosell

   archie chided him for leaving the
honorable calling of railroad engineer
and taking up with dissolute sailors
when the fellow professed ignorance of
the railroad business archie showed him
the watch and asked him whether he
didnt remember selling him the ticket
for it

   then suddenly this jekyll - hyde
character remembered all about the watch
incident when archie questioned him
as to the identity of the woman in the
case lie laughed and explained how the
game was worked then he examined
the watch and told archie that it was
of a make that had been handled by a
mail-order house in chicago exclusively
dugans pal

       

   he suggested that archie write them
giving the number of the case and also of
the works and possibly they could inform
him as to whom it had been sold archie
thought it was a capital idea

   i tried to dissuade him from acting
recklessly but i hadnt stopped to con-
sider that the foolish flier always travels
on a clear track archie was traveling on
the matrimonial limited and he ignored
my signals and tore ahead on down grade
to destruction

  he sent off his inquiry and in due
time the answer came that the watch had
been sold to one antoine picard at south
bethlehem pennsylvania

   you may not be aware commented
the book-agent  that the name beth-
lehem has been given to upward of one
hundred towns and villages by refer-
ence to this vade viecinn of information
you may-

   hold on sport put on the air
cautioned dugan  from the way you
interfere one might imagine you was
playing talk-back in a football game
when you started to run wild i was try-
ing to impart the information that archie
got busy and indited an epistle to the
bethlehemite with the quartier latin
name and asked him whether he had ever
owned the watch

   he got an answer stating that the
watch had been stolen from him about a
year back and offered archie a reward
for its return

   the answer transported archie to
the haven of happiness and he squan-
dered some more real money for postage
to inform that gallic bethlehemite that
he wouldreturn the watch in return for
some definite information about the orig-
inal of the photo in the case

   picard came back with a proposition
that archie take a trip to bethlehem meet
the original in person and get his infor-
mation at close range

   i realized that there was no use try-
ing to restrain that bally brakeman when
the hymeneal hawser was pulling him
bethlehemward

   the following sunday arrayed in his
gladsome garments lie journeyed to the
burg with a biblical name i did not see
him until monday night

     well boy i inquired  did you see
your divinity

   	r r

goes dippy	

    sure thing he replied

    whats her name  i asked

    marie heloise clothilde jeannette
louise antoinette picard he answered

  great scott i ejaculated isnt
that a rather voluminous name for a sin-
gle female 

    but she isnt a single female an-
swered archie

    married eh  i commented  well
it serves you right for getting dippy over
an unknown

  well no replied archie shes
only partly married

    see here boy i said  just loosen
up and let me have some details

    its like this replied archie  the
original of the picture happens to be the
sisters of antoine yes i said sisters
theres six of them when antoine
wanted to put their picture in his watch
he found that he couldnt get six photos
into it so he conceived the brilliant idea
of making a composite photograph of the
six and carrying that in his chronometer
the result was satisfying to antoine but
untrue to thexiriginals dugan old boy
you ought to see them

    no you dont i replied  youre
not going to drag me into a mesalliance
with any disintegrated portion of that
composite chromo

    theres two of them married re-
plied archie  and when i make up my
mind which of the remaining four is to
be mrs bruxton ill give you an invite
to the wedding

   well i got the invite all right but
it didnt happen to be one of the com-
posite coquettes that landed the suscep-
tible archie for while he was puzzling

we like to be as useful to our readers as we can but because of the great popularity
of this department we are forced to impose certain restrictions in future we
shall be compelled to limit its scope to the answering of questions of an inform-
ative technical or historical nature only

    we receive dozens of queries in regard to the right person to apply to for certain
classes of employment if the writers will pause for a moment to consider the title of
the proper official will readily occur to them and in any case the information can be
obtained by application to the headquarters of the company involved much more quickly
than we can publish it

    if a reader after following these directions still finds himself lacking in information
and will write us giving his full name and postal address we will try to satisfy him
through the mail but we cannot answer any letter in which it is not made clear that
some real difficulty exists

some time ago i had occasion while
handling air on trains from the rear
with the tail-pipe to back an engine
with one heavy coach from the depot to the
yard i placed my tail-hose or  gun as
we say on the rear end tried my air and
set the brakes the excess pressure of
ourse releasing them

  i gave whistle sfgnal to back up and we
jroceeded to the yard where another en-
gine was standing i applied the air slowly
until we were about  feet away from this
engine but it had no effect to reduce speed
so i threw valve in emergency letting air
out of train-pipe when the air escaped i
could tell it had no force

  we were going about five miles an hour
and struck this engine which i mentioned
but fortunately with  damage this has
happened several times lately and we have
a dispute about it

 what caused this to occur was it my

  fault the brakes or the fault of the engi-
neer-j w w chicago illinois

  without knowing all of the conditions im-
plied in your interesting query we could not
say positively what the exact cause was but
judging from the manner in which the appli-
cation of the brakes was made the back-up
hose was open or at least partially this re-
duced the brake-pipe pressure somewhat
and caused the feed-valve to open wide at
the brake-valve thus supplying the air to
the brake-pipe as fast as it was being re-
duced at the rear

  no doubt the brake had also been applied
partially in service thereby reducing the pos-
sibility of obtaining quick action even if the
brake-pipe was wide open without having
made a partial service application however
the same difficulty in obtaining the quick ac-
by the light of the lantern



tion would be liable to occur for the reason
that the feed-valve would be supplying air
to the brake-pipe very rapidly thus prevent-
ing the rapid drop in brake-pipe pressure
necessary to obtain quick action or even a
quick service application of the brake in
other words the condition necessary to pro-
duce quick action had probably not been
obtained

js fall river massachusetts-we have

	intimated many times in this depart-
-ment that we cannot pass on the merits or
demerits of any school or institution adver-
tising a course in firing locomotives this
attitude is due principally to the fact that we
know nothing about any of them other than
the information which may be gained from
a perusal of their advertising matter which
you can secure  application and because
we have never known or talked with one of
their graduates

  it would appear from the literature men-
tioned that so far as the theoretical knowl-
edge which may be gained is concerned the
courses taught are no doubt of value we
know that many good firemen are wofully
weak in this end of it furthermore we
know that the time is fast coming in fact
is here when a man will have to pass a very
good examination on the theory of combus-
tion and many other things heretofore dis-
regarded before he will be allowed to run
an engine

   we do not believe that the actual work of
handling the scoop and the art of keeping
the fire in good condition at all times and un-
der diverse conditions can be learned any-
where except on the footplate we havemo
knowledge whatever of the ability of the
school you mention to secure positions for
its graduates

   they are of course in touch with various
master mechanics and keep the latter ad-
vised of their available men the long and
short of it would be solely whether the mas-
ter mechanic or employing official would

prefer to take the new men this way rather
than through personal acquaintance with
them your size and weight indicate that
you are physically qualified to perform the
work of a fireman but as you are under age
on some roads it would be necessary to se-
cure a minors release before going to work

but from our knowledge regarding recom-
pense we are inclined to the opinion that
this is exceptionally high they do not ap-
pear in the official guide in the capacity
which that name suggests but in view of the
importance of their work they should prop-
erly be so considered

if an engine were fired up all ready for a
run could it run on level track for half
an hour with but one shovelful of coal
after starting

  	what railroad has the most track in
use under one management in the united
states

  	does the southern pacific have the
longest engines in the united states i
have heard that two of theirs measure over
all ninety-two feet

   	which is the hardest to fire a large
or a small engine-n m s angel island

  	this would depend absolutely on the
conditions under which the engine was run
if the fire were built up in good shape such
as it would be before pulling out with a hard
fast run and the cars were omitted that is
nothing but the light engine considered it
might lie possible to run it for half an hour
by careful handling

   on the contrary if we assume your ques-
tion to mean an engine with a train the an-
swer is that it wouldnt run very far or very
long without intelligent firing and plenty of
it if the train was heavy it is a very hard
drag  a fire to get the swing  a train of
eight or ten cars and without attention it
would soon burn down or become so pulled

this particular dimension

	more work is naturally required to
maintain the fire in proper condition in en-
gines having extensive grate area than in
those with small fire-boxes so far as the
actual physical effort is concerned it has
been our experience that more skill is re-
quired to fire the small engine properly the

majority of the big fellows steam so freely
that the work becomes merely a question of
the endurance available for baling the coal
into them the others have to be humored
and the coal has to go just where the fire-
man wants it and in quantities  more
than needed

in what position are the eccentrics on the
axle in relation to the crank-pin of a
locomotive

  	how much steam pressure is there
 the slide-valve of a locomotive and is the
pressure on the valve the same as the pres-
sure around it

  	what is the difference between a
slide-valve a balance-valve and a piston-
valve as used  a locomotive-g n s
friedens pennsylvania

  	depends entirely on whether the
valve motion of your engine is what is called
direct or indirect direct motion engines
may be considered as those in which the
slide valve is driven by the eccentric and
rod without the interposition of a rocker
arm

  a rocker arm which is a pivoted device
naturally reverses the motion imparted by
the eccentric rod and necessitates a different
arrangement of the eccentrics on the shaft
the large majority of locomotives have the
indirect motion which cannot be avoided
owing to the height of the valve on its face
above the center line of motion or the line
drawn through the centers of all axles

  in such cases the forward motion eccen-
tric is placed with its throw above the crank-
pin when the latter is  the center or  fol-
lowing  the crank-pin in shop parlance
the back-motion eccentric with the crank-
pin in the position above defined would be
in a corresponding position below the crank-
pin

  if the slide or piston-valve had  lap or
had no lead the center of the eccentric
throw would be set at right angles with the
crank-pin the forward at right angle above
and the back at right angle below all
valves however have some outside lap and
as a rule some lead therefore it becomes
necessary to advance the eccentric toward
the pin a distance equal to the sum of the
lap and the lead

  a handy rule for this in the instance of
the locomotive would set the center of the
throw of the forward-motion eccentric at
the third spoke in the driving wheel above
the crank that is reckoning from the posi-
by the light of the lantern



tion of the wheel with the crank-pin on the
center logically therefore the center of
the throw of the back-motion eccentric
would be at the third spoke below the
crank-pin

  	if the packing strips are tight there
is practically no pressure on the top of a
balanced slide-valve with which the large
majority of locomotives are equipped ex-
cept from what steam may leak over the
packing strips due to poor fit or wear and
this leakage is provided for through a small
hole in the center of the valve which allows
whatever leakage may ensue to pass into
the exhaust cavity of the valve and thence
into the stack

  the pressure in the steam-chest around
the slide-valve is generally reckoned at 
per cent of boiler pressure it being com-
puted that  per cent is lost between the
throttle-valve and steam-chest through wire-
drawing radiation and condensation

  	a balanced slide-valve is protected
with packing strips or rings arranged to
make a steam-tight joint on a true plate
above the valve this relieves it of tre-
mendous pressure to which it would be
subjected secures corresponding ease of
movement and not least a minimum of wear
to the seat  which the valve travels

  a plain slide-valve of which few exam-
ples remain in locomotive design of the pres-
ent day lias no packing strips or rings and
has equal steam pressure  sides and top
the objections to this type and which re-
sulted in its retirement were difficulty in
securing proper lubrication in handling the
reverse lever under steam and the rapid
wear of both valve and seat

  a piston-valve of which many examples
are now standard in this country is simply
as its name implies two pistons representing
the edges of the slide-valve and connected
by a rod this rod forming the valve-stem
when outside admission the space between
the two pistons becomes the exhaust cavity
when inside admission the space between the
pistons contains the live steam for admis-
sion to the cylinders

  i either instance the valve is nicely bal-
anced this latter being the advantage
claimed for it its weak point is in the lia-
bility to breakage of the packing rings which
encircle the pistons to make them steam
tight in the valve chamber although so
many piston-valves are now in use it can
scarcely be claimed that they have yet passed
from the experimental stage

  it needs but a reference to the reports is-
sued by the various locomotive building con-
cerns to show that many new engines are
still specified to be built with the regular
balanced slide-valve undoubtedly skepti-

cism still prevails to a marked degree in re-
gard to the utility of thg much-exploited
piston-valve

please tell me whether or not an engine
is considered as a train-c l s nor-
folk virginia

  an engine running alone if displaying sig-
nals or carrying markers is always regard-
ed as a train this does not apply to engines
running in yards or within yard limits

rule no  says trains will not
leave the following stations without
train order or clearance card  a
 s and  z  conductor engine  re-
ceives an order at  a  to run extra to  s
and accept caution card on work extras 
 and  working between  b  and  d
operator at  a  gives conductor a caution
card the conductor refuses a clearance
card saying he does not need one as he has
his orders and a caution card who is right
the operator or the conductor-e v p
schenectady new york

  as you have quoted the rule which makes
a train order or a clearance equally effective
and conductor had orders it would appear
that the clearance card was not necessary
there is no reason however why he should
refuse to accept a card except on the techni-
cality which the rule implies

why is the high-pressure cylinder on a
compound locomotive so called when
it is smaller than the low-pressure
cylinder

  	where will i get a book explaining
valve setting and going into machinery in
detail-g f h maricopa california

  	because it first receives the steam
from the boiler and uses it at that pressure
minus  per cent due to condensation radia-
tion etc before exhausting it into the larger
cylinder this latter is termed the low-
pressure cylinder because it is supplied
solely by the exhaust steam from the high-
pressure cylinder and the reason that it is

made of much larger diameter than the other
is because the steam which it receives is
much reduced in pressure and in order to
partially offset this loss it is spread over a
greater piston area

fw f chicago illinois-a second
 man is always carried  electric loco-
motives practically in the same capacity as
was a fireman when these roads were for-
merly operated by steam the proposition
was made to dispense with the second man
in the interests of economy but the matter
was taken up by the labor organizations and
two men were conceded with scarcely an ar-
gument against it

  the duty of the second man is to assist
the operator where required to observe and
call the signals and anything of a similar
nature which would naturally be suggested
electric railroading  the largest scale is
at present carried on by the new york cen-
tral and hudson river railroad out of
new york city and by the new york new
haven and hartford railroad between new
york and stamford connecticut about thir-
ty-seven miles

  this latter road will shortly extend its
electric zone from stamford to new haven
connecticut making a total electric division
of seventy-five miles it should not be lost
sight of that the baltimore and ohio rail-
road was practically the pioneer in this form
of transportation on a generous scale as
back in  they began hauling their trains
both freight and passenger from camden
station baltimore maryland through the
belt line tunnel to the northern outskirts
of the city the fact that these original
baltimore and ohio motors were just as
efficient in their day as the ones now in use
forms almost a convincing argument that the
development of the electric engine is not all
which might be reasonably looked for

  if railroads were generally electrified
there would probably be no better time made
than at present the time  the new ha-
ven from stamford to new york was made
with ease by steam and from all we can
learn it is made no easier now

please describe the  mother hubbard 
type of locomotive are there any in
use now-t j san jose california

  this term applies to engines equipped
with the wooten or extended fire-box
they came into prominence about  at
which time this form of fire-box was patent-
ed it was a radical departure from the
existing type of eight-wheel or american
locomotive inasmuch that the fire-box was
extended completely across the gage of
the track and over the driving wheels thus
permitting a vastly increased grate area

  this extension resulted in the cab being
placed ahead of it or about in the center of
the boiler as if located in the usual place
on the end of the boiler it would take up
the clearances along the permanent way
all engines having the cab so located are
broadly termed  mother hubbards and
there are hundreds if not thousands run-
ning in this country

  they are almost the standard engine on
the lehigh valley railroad and the erie
and the delaware lackawanna and western
have a large number of them in service

   there is a prejudice against them as the
engineer and fireman are quite remote in
performing their duties this is so strong
in some sections that this type cannot run in
certain states we think ohio and indiana
and they are gradually dropping out they
have always been regarded with favor by
motive-power management as with their
tremendous grate area they are able to get
along with very inferior fuel in fact the
idea of mr wooten when he first took out
his patent was for an engine with a fire-box
so designed that it would burn satisfactorily
the culm from mines

gw v douglas arizona-it is said

	that while an engine is in tow of an-
other that the injectors on the dead engine
will fill the boiler by proceeding as follows
place reverse lever in back motion and open
main throttle cylinder cocks and injector
steam ram

   the idea is that the pistons of the engine
being towed will act as pumps and the ten-
dency thereby being to rid the boiler of air
a vacuum would be created within the boiler
or at least a vacuum sufficient to raise the

   check-valves from their seats and allow the
water to flow in through the tank hose feed-
pipe injector and branch pipe theoret-
ically this should be so but we have person-
ally never had a practical connection with
the experiment no doubt this will meet the
eye of many of our older readers among
the engineers who can cite a case of fact

how would you proceed if a valve yoke
broke  the road with a plain slide-
valve engine with balanced valves

j h baltimore maryland

   a valve yoke usually breaks off at the neck
of the valve-stem it will be readily dis-
covered at the exhaust by a tremendous
blow if the valve is pushed far enough
ahead it will blow if not it is often mis-
taken for a slipped eccentric so would sug-
gest that the eccentrics be examined first

  it may be discovered in this way place
the crank-pin  top or bottom quarter and
reverse engine if the steam continues to
come -out of the back cylinder-cock you
may depend it is usually the yoke a great
diversity of opinion exists regarding the
best remedy for this kind of break the
time-honored and safest way is to raise the
chest cover and block the ports central re-
place the cover remove the valve-rod and
main rod and block the cross-head at the
back end

  but this remedy requires much time and
labor and as time is a very important con-
sideration  the road and there appears
to be  mechanical objection to the other
methods provided that the cross-head is
securely fastened we will state them dis-
connect the valve-rod and push the valve
clear ahead remove the stem if it
would blow out and use a gasket back of
the gland or hold the valve-stem intact with
a valve-stem clamp block the cross-head at
the front end and proceed the pressure
will hold the valve forward and if the valve
should move it will do  harm provided
the cross-head be securely blocked another
way is to remove the release-valve push
the valve clear back fit a block into the
release-valve long enough to hold the valve
back then block cross-head at back end
still another way is to push the valve-stem
forward and clamp it by cocking the gland
then block cross-head at the front end

  if the yoke is only broken at one side
of the valve it will affect only one exhaust
when the yoke pushes the valve forward
the valves will sound all right but when it
pulls the valve back the engine will be lame
with careful handling you may finish your
trip work engine in full gear with a light
throttle

 you-all has got the most ridiculous

   oh ill get her all right some

 yes and then i reckon youre cal-

  i assured him that such were my in-

 got any life insurance he drawled
 what the thunder has that got to
do with it you old sorehead i de-
manded in some heat  youre nothing
but a rank old calamity howler 

  he only grinned

   lemme tell you of a funny wrestle
of little spikes with one of

youll sure sabe whyfor this
life insurance is a good play to
make when you-all invest in

  go on bust yourself i
snapped at him  but dont
think that youre going to
throw any scare into me
spike rolled himself another
paper pipe and after blowing
a few smoke - rings at the
ceiling broke into a reminiscent
chuckle

   which this here episode is
sure the banner frolic of my
life he laughed

   long about four years
back i was baling diamonds
out of winslow on the santa

   meanwhile with my natural bent
for accumulating foolish and irrespon-
sible friends me and another shorthorn
billy day contrives to git thick as the
little colorado river in july which
stream in that festive month is that solid
that a man has to use an ax to extract
a bucket of water-

   day and me tracks along annexing
the dinero and not having any suitable
outlet whereby to dispose of it we lays by

longside of us so we libates frequent
and deep

   theaters and such minor frivolities
serves to while away the time but i no-
tices billy gets quite a peeve on about
something so i nails him and asks
whats the trouble bout that time billy
gets an illumination that was sure a
peach he lets all alberquerque know
by pulling off a navajo sun - dance in
the middle of center street before i

 well project

around with her
insides and see if
we cant get a
move out of her

quite a respectable pile one day billy
and me gets our heads together and sizes
up our roll man she looms up like
a barn in a fog she sure looks huge

   with one eye on that wad and the
other far away on the festive gaieties
of alberquerque i makes a motion that
we lay off and proceed to that burg in
search of these aforesaid festivities mo-
tion seconded and carried like a stampede
of dogie cattle for water

    so four days later sees us arm in arm
parading center street alberquerque
happy as two little birds billy gets
infatuated with a sure nough lectric
street-car and after four round trips
i has to drag him away by main force
he lows hes sure due to get metropolitan
plenty pronto

   a multitude of thirst emporiums
along the right of way reminds us that
for dryness the mojave desert is a fool

gets him bedded down in the hotel and
inquires whyfor this exhibition

    spike says he when he gets
calmed down  this here outfit of ours
aint putting on enough dog to suit me
we dont allow to have these here new
mexican sharps a saying that old ari-
zona ever sent out anything that was
slow what we want to do is to make
this prairie-dog town set up and take
notice lets give em an episode from
which they can date time

    go to it old socks i told him
 im with you from soda to hock
watcher going to do i asks him be-
ing some curious

    hangfino yet says he  but the idea
is ripening fast lets hire that big red
auto down the street a piece and go for
a ride to think it over

   we ambles down to this here auto
stable and dickers with the old negro


the railroad mans magazine

that runs her for the big red wagon
aforesaid there was a man to run her
that was included in the deal and we
piles in for a little spin swelling up
something awful

   shes sure fine riding so we makes
this auto herder run us out to did town
just to see what she can do out there
we stopped at the road-house to remove
the dust from our tonsils with a few high
ones

   then we begin to get merry and lays
the bed-plates for more trouble than
we can rightly handle

   when we start back billy insists
that this here auto runner instruct him
as to the whys and the wherefores of
running the trouble cart and right there
was where i begin to see a large patch
of dark-blue trouble on the horizon

   autos being a strange game to me
i follows my usual custom of sitting
tight saying nothing and keeping an
eye skinned for the other fellows while
playing my hand close to my necktie

   billy having reached that stage
where he was the great jajandrum with
the little round button on top and this
mechanic beginning to utter objections
billy lights out of that front seat with
a deep purple howl and starts for that
runner-chap making war medicine

   heres where this runner sees a great
white light for he hops out of lis seat
and streaks it oft into the dim distance
like a scared coyote billy three jumps
behind and several hollers ahead

   having satisfactorily abolished that
spavined skate we will now proceed to
navigate this here do-funny on our own
hook says billv - come over here spike
and cast your eagle eye over this lay-
out of levers and such like

   i came

    whatcher make of em he asks

   im stumped and says so

    well never say die says he  well
project around with her insides and see
if we cant get a move out of her and
he pulls a lever here and there

   no go

    oh thunderation says he  i for-
got to wind her up git out and give
that handle a twist or so spike says he
pointing to a crank hanging out of the
pilot of the machine

   i hops out and grabs the handle
three turns i gave her and then
chuff says the machine and the han-
dle sneaks up and lands me a wallop on
the head like the crack of doom i
retires to the roadside in confusion and
a beautiful display of fireworks

    whoopee  yells bill  shes going
spike malone autos



all right come along here spike 
dont you mind a little thing like
  little thing  i snorts 
thing did you ever
git kicked by a jassax

no well youve got 
it coming this here 
outrage has a mule -f
skinned eight ways for v

git in  billy grabs the little wheel that done
that the steering and pushed the lever back
 little and the noises ceased i began to feel

better but he had to
go making more ex-
periments and the
next thing i know im
on my back in the hind
part of t auto and

billy emitting joyous whoops

like unto a sioux buck on the
war-path and little me beat-
ing a tom-tom accompaniment
on the big drum

sunday wait till the scenery quits going
round and ill join you

   i gets up and navigates some un-
steady on my pins over to the machine
the object of remarks from a large col-
lection of mexicans that blew up when
the fracas started

  just then billy horses over a lever
and comes tumbling into my arms and
the buzz-wagon takes a flying start back-
ward that would have done arthur duffy
proud it fetched up against a handy
wall making curious sounds also the
mexican population vanished suddenly
and the sounds they left behind indicated
surprise and a good deal of scare

   we corraled the machine again by
that time my mad was up and we board-
ed her with warlike intentions

we are streaking it down the road billy
hanging onto his steering-wheel yelping
most joyous

    plold on sport  i warned him
 we better take another track to town
that runner chap you herded so grace-
fully off the scene will be sitting up in
this pike like a bereaved catamount howl-
ing for vengeance with a passel of cops
to keep him company against our com-
ing so we sheared off down a by-road
for a short cut to town

  just as we turned the corner an old
mexicana came into the road driving an
ancient wagon and a more ancient plug
the sight of our little procession revived
all the youth in the horse he stood up
on his hind legs and made faces at us
and then whirled off down the road like


the railroad mans magazine

a comet with a tail of dust market vege-
tables and plaintive mexican protests
we followed gaily on

  our path was narrow but not straight
by a heap far from it the trail we
left behind would have made a snake
dizzy  was getting kind o seasick but
billy seemed to be having the time of his
life

   all of a sudden the car stopped dead
and billy took a header out on the road
while yours truly made what was called
in the innocent days of my boyhood a
belly-whopper dive over the pilot and
onto the right of way

    now what the mischief caused that
ruction   i queried of billy who stood
regarding me real foolish

    i just touched off the brake says
he

    flow did you know it was the
brake i wanted to know

     i didnt then says he  but i aint
got no doubts now  and neither had i

   in we got and i says to bill  lead
on floratio but the next time you do any
braking you make a light application and
leave that big hole strictly alone when
i get out hereafter i may get out on my
feet not my face-sabe but all the an-
swer i got was a growl and we were off
on our career of glory again

   we rounded a corner and ran plumb
into a salvation army meeting meet-
ing was dismissed right away when we
had cleared the mess i found that the
big bass drum had careened into the back
of the auto and rescuing it i began to
play a tom-tom on it to add my bit to the
excitement

   by this time i was really beginning
to enjoy it we were making quite a hit

   the next turn brought us into cen-
ter avenue the bright and busy broad-
way of alberquerque we were going
by and large high wide and handsome
billy emitting joyous whoops like unto a
sioux buck on the war-path and little me
beating a tom-tom accompaniment on the
big bass drum

  to help out the effect the auto was
doing its best to give fine portrayals of
a big red moki buck indian pulling off
the famous snake-dance of his tribe she
sure was glorious add to this a large
and ever-growing string of interested
spectators who strove earnestly to over-

take us and you have some glimmering
of the sensation we produced

    business was suspended for the day
when we passed the sidewalks were
miraculously deserted on our approach
still we did manage to pull off a few
stunts by way of variety the auto
swooped into a peanut-stand on one loop
and then went right across the street and
took a market-basket out of a deaf wom-
ans hand we left her the hysterics by
way of recompense however

    as we neared the railroad tracks i
begin to see our finish and a large scar-
let finish it was there was a crowd
there the police had a rope stretched
across the road to stop us

     whoa billy  i yelled at him
 look at the reception committee theyve
got spread out there for us better stop

    he turned his face to me and yelled
 stop blazes  i cant stop  that brake
wont work 

    oh lord  i groaned from the
depths of my heart

    a bevy of the blue-coated minions
of the law awaited us with outstretched
arms but not of welcome

    billy saw them too and tried to take
the corner but the auto had other designs
and plowed across the street and into a
druggists window

    here the beast gave an expiring groan
and ceased activity in one gorgeous burst
of orange-colored flame and a rank odor
but we went on into the store i lit be-
hind the soda-fountain from which the
clerk promptly skedaddled while billy
went on and demolished the cigar-case be-
fore he toppled the cashiers stand over on
that outraged young lady

   i remembered thinking before the
darkness descended that we was plumb
lucky to light where we did medical at-
tendance being so handy and nice

    murmuring  send for the wrecker
i went peacefully to sleep

    afterward in the convalescent ward
billy remarks to me that we finished our
ride with  eclaw -whatever the blazes
that is when i disagreed with him and
stood out that our finish was the drug-
store he was inclined to agree until the
consequences burst in upon our inner
senses and then we decided that our finish
was yet to come

    it was
observations of a country
station-agent

by j e smith

no -to the boys who bend over the desks-a bunch of workers
who tackle many weighty problems but are
human after all

       was a passenger on one of our
  local passenger - trains recent-
  ly-a train of one baggage-car
  and two coaches we had
   fifty-five pay passengers on
  board every mile our gross
  earnings were one dollar and ten cents

  we are single track on the first long
siding there was a train of hoppers load-
ed with coke and in the clear to let us by
on a ways in another siding also into a
clear for us was a train of meat every-
thing was out of the way for us

  the two trains lying by while we
passed represented the revenue possibili-
ties of the road they were the money-
makers our train with its service and
equipment amounted to but little but
everything else was held up to let us pro-
ceed on time

  it has always been that way the
freight business of the road is subservient
to the passenger

  the passenger is the spectacular side
a passenger conductor is the majordomo
of the road ten people consult a ticket-
agent to one the freight-agent

  the public is insistent and explosive
over the passenger service but not one

series bccan la the july  railroad m

man in five ever touches or knows any-
thing of the freight service

   when you speak of a railroad the pub-
 lic has only a mental vision of passenger-
 trains and passenger-stations

   it sees a freight pull through with coal
 and iron and the countrys products and
 the only sensation aroused is that the
 noise and smoke ought to be abated

   village trustees will act commercial
 bodies will petition and all the force and
 persuasion of local authorities will be ex-
 ercised to induce railroads to build pas-
 senger stations of dizzy architecture
 who ever heard of a people demanding
 a convenient commodious and showy
 freight-house

   i got off the train in an industrial
town

   the passenger - station is located be-
 tween two busy streets and is flanked by
 a lawn of flowers and shrubs it is a
 fancy ornate minareted and porteco-
 chered structure

   the people of the town are proud of it
 as belonging to them same as the car-
 negie library or the new post-office all
 in a public sense understand but in no
 way thankful or considerate of the rail-

 in magazine single copies  cents

l


the railroad mans magazine

road company that furnished the money
to erect it

  i disguised myself as a government in-
spector

   what are your average receipts from
the sale of tickets  i asked the agent

   take it for the month replied the
agent  make it about forty-five hun-
dred dollars but if you want to ex-
amine the records you will have to show
me your certificate

  i bade him good morning one of
those nice genteel fare-you-well and see-
you-again backstepping and apologetic
good-byes

  i went three squares down the track to
the freight-house

  i assumed a sort of dignified and au-
thoritative poise and thrust my hand into
my inside coat-pocket i rummaged a
moment ind then exclaimed with a show
of exasperation

  by george my cards and certifi-
cates are in another pocket maybe you
will tell me anyway-about what are the
average monthly earnings of this office 
 from twenty to twenty-five thousand
dollars said the chief clerk thumbing
over a bunch of correspondence and never
raising an eye

   thats about five times as much busi-
ness as they do at the passenger-station
is it not 

   anyway that much more

   when your business is so much more
than the passenger - stations why dont
they have flower-beds around and have
a few gables and some dormer windows
and tile roofing and gimcrack eaves-

   flow long have you been out  asked
the clerk

   ornaments - decorations-curlicues
-harmony - esthetic equilibrium - the
freight-house beautiful 

   we ought to find some way to no-
tify his folks put in another clerk

  but just then a big redfaced dray-
man elbowed me away from the coun-
ter and i stepped outside and surveyed
the rakish-looking structure that an-
swered for a freight-house

  low flat soiled and begrimed un-
sought and unknown by the people gen-
erally it had the merit to the company
of bringing in five dollars to every one
taken in at the passenger-station with all
the latters spectacular flubdubbery

  there are no frills about the freight
business to catch the public eye it
creates no public interest if a road puts
on two additional passenger-trains it is
an event of keen interest to every one liv-
ing along the line it can put on a half-
dozen new freight-trains and no one
knows or cares about it beyond the em-
ployees

   what bureau or association do you
represent   asked the chief clerk with
a sort of weary indifference when i re-
appeared at the counter  we- have an
inspector of some sort for every working
hour of the day he went on without
waiting for me to reply  let me see
we had the car-service inspector here at
nine oclock we had the inspector for
the bureau of weights and measures at
ten we had the joint rate commission
man at eleven

   we have representatives of the state
railroad commission the interstate
commission the live stock inspector
the nursery stock inspector and the
pure food law man

   the state fertilizer inspector ought
to be here some time to-day and in be-
tween we have a few special agents of
our own to look after cars buildings in-
surance real estate right-of-way and
other things my dear sir there isnt
any angle of our business that isnt pro-
vided for either by the government or
the railroad maybe you are the in-
spector of ventilation dont think he
has called  us yet

  i grasped at the straw and bestowed
 the clerk one of my sickly ingratia-
ting smiles

   thats it thats me  i exclaimed
triumphantly  im the hot air man
sorry i havent a card but never mind
that i want to write up the freight-
house and the force i want to make a
story for other railroads of the strange
sensational and amusing events that oc-
cur in a local freight-office

  the clerk eyed me with a peary-to-
cook gaze

   my deluded friend said he  no
one cares for us no one sees us al
we do is to get the business and take in
the money nothing ever happens with-
in these dismal walls do not waste your
efforts on us go out and see the yard-
crew chase the section-gang down the

track interview the crossing switchman
down on no  there are some camp-
cars of macedonians and syrians the
newest and rawest recruits to the rail-
road army see em-

  at that moment a clerk who was ma-
king out expense bills at a desk on the
other side of the office suddenly jumped
up and grasped a book and brought it
down with two or three resounding

roach is geared up like barney old-
fields auto and it takes quick and violent
action to light on one of them

   but hiram had a real adventure a
few nights ago no doubt you read about
it in the dailies yes that was it head-
ed night expressman robbed held
up by a lone bandit and many thou-
sand dollars taken  detectives at work
on the case railroads and express
officials refuse to make known the
amount taken 

 scare headlines all right
enough well that all happened to
hiram over there the boy that
single-handed encountered the cock-
roach

 hiram is baggage-master for
two night-trains at the passenger-
station when they are gone hiram

a cockroach is geared up like barney oldfields auto and it takes
quick and violent action to light on one

whacks on the desk then jumped the
floor a half-dozen times with all the fury
of a maniac he then calmly resumed
his seat picked up his indelible and pro-
ceeded expensing

   poor fellow said i sympathetically
 unbalanced from trying to do three
mens work awful thing to have fraz-
zled nerves has lie a family

   be not alarmed said the chief clerk
assuringly  be not deceived hiram
had just killed a cockroach you cant
run a local freight-office without cock-
roaches any more than you can run a
boarding-house without prunes a cock-

tucks the freight-house mail into a bag
and treks for the freight-house half-
way between the two places the other
night he ran onto captain kidd or dick
duval or robert younger and it was a
case of hands up

   the robber took the bag -he never
touched hirams silveroid watch his imi-
tation ruby nor the forty-four cents he
had left over from last months pay all
he wanted was the bag and its contents
fie got it and he made away with it

   lie left certain orders with hiram
relative to posing and hiram stood there
in the attitude of grasping with one hand


the railroad mans magazine

the handle of the great dipper and with
the other making a one-handed stop of
haileys comet

   after a time a night-watchman ac-
cidentally found him and told him he
could relax

   the lone bandit made a rich haul
he got the papers in ten claims he got
an even dozen of tracers he got a brand-
new tic luxe edition of the southern
classification he got supplements and
circulars enough to make him the wisest
bandit that ever raised a gun no won-
der the railroad and express people re-
fused to talk a robbery like that stuns
us all

    i notice the clerk over at the cabinet
muttering to himself said i softly to the
chief clerk  when he crossed the room
a moment ago he moved with a halting
jerky step he isnt disconnected on one
side is he 

  that is the rate-clerk judge him
gently i will explain we have print-
ed instructions from every source cover-
ing every phase of transportation we
have all the classifications we have ex-
ceptions and qualifying rules we get
crisscrossing and amending supplements
and circulars until it has the rate-clerk
going like a prairie air-motor on a windy
day it is a wise rate-clerk that sits
down to his desk these exacting days and
knows exactly where he is

   you noticed the rate-clerk get up and
walk over to the water-cooler after two
hours assorting filing and adjusting
you thought he appeared groggy it
may be he is developing locomotor ataxia
following the devious windings to find
what it all means and where it belongs

   but that peculiar expression of the
eyes  

   that is the strabismus he gets that
by trying to follow supplement r- to

iic  amending that part of ar-
ticle  paragraph x and canceling cir-
cular  and restoring the provisions
of joint notice  and calling particu-
lar attention to rule b-see reference
no xx notes  f and gg for expla-
nation of character-marks see page 
etc etc

   last month he forgot the pay-car a
tew evenings ago he remained at his desk
working after the rest of us had gone

   these are serious symptoms

   they indicate an acute attack of in-
flammatory supplemento tarilfitis - that
new disease

   we have recommended a change of
air and scene what we mean by that is
for him to get up and go out into the
freight-house stand in the door and look
out over the vacant lot adjoining shifting
the vision leisurely to the ice-house and
then to the row of cpal-sheds that lie in
the offing

   then he should engage the freight-
house man in light blithesome conversa-
tion as he loads his truck with green hides
at the same time harking to the melliflu-
ous chant of the slaughter-house team-
ster who has just mashed a thumb then
back to the desk for in the meantime
another batch of tariffs and supplements
has arrived

  almost every freight-office is provided
with a back door or window view

  whenever there is a lull a clerk stands
and gazes out pensively it may over-
look a vacant lot some dingy cars a
straggling tree or two or merely the city
garbage dump

  no matter

  many times a day a clerk looks out
on it and dreams then he saunters back
to his desk and another clerk looks out
and dreams

  however gloomy the perspective or un-
inviting the view in some way over the
routine it casts roseate reflections it cre-
ates a longing for the open and mental
mirages of fields and lakes autos and
steam-yachts

   see here john said the chief clerk
 you have looked out of the window ten
times a day for three years and now after
ten thousand inspections it is safe to say
you cannot write a description of that
big tree that stands in the foreground
that will enable any one to identify it

  john tried it with a bravado flourish
but failed he could not say if it was
elm oak or maple the kind of leaf nor
the number or direction of its principal
branches

   whats the odds  retorted john de-
fiantly  thats got nothing to do with
booking freight-bills

  strangely enough none of the others
could describe the most prominent ob-
jects

  that is the way we learned they were
observations of a country station-agent 

not looking-only dreaming the peep
of the open contained nothing within it-
self only the subtle suggestion of the
boundless beyond

  it is a dead dull life indeed to the
man who works all the time within nar-
row walls if there are not some dreams
some hope concealed in the far-off years
to be unfolded

  credit shakespeare with this

  true hope is swift and flies with swal-
    lows wings

  kings it makes gods and meaner crea-
    tures kings

   pardon me said  to the chief clerk
 the voluminous document you now
hold in your hand bearing the large let-
ters  special and which you are about
to enclose in an envelope marked with a
register stamp has aroused my curiosity
may i ask the purport of it  

   you may replied the chief clerk
blandly at the same time unfolding and

smoothing out the papers  this is a
freight claim

  indeed i exclaimed does it
involve some fundamental right of the
road-some vital privilege-some-

   you judge by the bulk the truth is
it is for three dollars and sixty cents the
chief clerk explained  and no constitu-
tional question raised this is for dam-s
age on a shipment of drain tile and some
of them were broken these papers seek
to find the cause of the damage and fix
the responsibility

   that is an easy matter is it not   i
asked with childlike innocence

  the chief clerk bestowed a pitying
glance

   we have here he went on thumb-
ing the papers one by one  a car that
was handled by three conductors and
went through two yards we have state-
ments from every man who handled the
car to this effect  no rough handling in
my charge so you see there is but one

 grasping with one
hand the handle oh
the great dipper and
with the other making
a one-handed stop of
halleys comet


the railroad mans magazine

inference and that is that certain con-
tractions and expansions brought on by
variations of the temperature have
broken the tile that puts it up to provi-
dence

   isnt it possible that some of those
statements are incorrect  

   why should we doubt why should
we question the word of our fellow work-
ers did you ever stop to think what
a horrible thing it is to lose faith in man
i have looked over claims for ten years
and i have seen that statement ten thou-
sand times no rough handling in my
charge

   and now sir i know by undisputed
testimony first hand that no two cars
ever came together with greater force
than is employed in smacking the lips of
a fair lady

  i watched him seal up the papers

   may i ask why you lick the envel-
ope twice

   sh-sh- he replied with an admon-
ishing wave of the hand and bending to-
ward me  it is an office secret it is
a large part of our food-supply and
comes to us gratis never breathe it if
it were known the company would spread

the mucilage thinner on the envelope-
flap

   what document have you there i
asked of the bill-clerk

   a tracer he replied  theres
thousands of them in circulation sir
they are put out as recklessly as clearing-
house certificates during a panic
you see when a shipment dont
arrive the day before its
shipped we have to put a
tracer after it

   people have great faith in
tracers when a patron kicks of
delay we tell him well put a
tracer after it he does not
know just what a tracer is but
he has a misty sort of an idea
that it lets out a few hoarse
bloodhound barks gets its nose
to the rail picks up the scent
and runs down the loitering
shipments with amazing speed
and certainty its a sort of
opiate we give our kicking pa-
trons quiets them for the time
its all a fake sir

   a tracer is a printed blank
whereon one agent informs an-
other that he has forwarded on
such a date and waybill one
crate of cabbage has it been
delivered what date and to
whom  in time unless it ac-
cidentally falls into the waste-
basket or office-stove the receiving-agent
returns the tracer with the necessary in-
formation now if the crate should ar-
rive about the time the tracer is put out
it gets the credit for turning the trick

   there seems to be a general impres-
sion that  putting a tracer after it  is
the same as placing the lever at high-
speed notch the real fact is it hurries
matters about as much as writing  rush 
 a letter before dropping it in the post-
office

   there isnt much excitement about a
freight-office the chief clerk ventured
after a while  the draymen line up to
the counter every day for their bills and
some one from the factories comes over
with the daily billing there is no rustle
of silk and nod of ostrich plumes and
happy vacation faces like they have even-
hour over at the passenger-station all
our joys come by telephone

it is a large part of our food-supply and
comes to us gratis

   unfinished business continued the
chief clerk hanging up the receiver

  the telephone is a great invention and
convenience in modern business transac-
tions but it has an irritating rudeness
not possessed by any other mechanical
contrivance it doesnt matter what you
are doing or when it  butts in  with a
persistence dangerously provoking

  there is nothing tentative about a
 phone nothing of the  i beg your
pardon for interrupting but- it has

neither politeness nor modesty no mat-
ter what mood you are in what occupies
your thoughts or engages your hands it
calls harshly and unmindfully for imme-
diate attention

  time and again in every local freight-
office there is a mad impulse-to seize the
apparatus and hurl it through the win-
dow occasionally the wind or lightning
kindly puts it out of business for a little
while a peaceful quiet - a delightful
calm series down over the office and
work proceeds with despatch

  the boys who bend over the desks in
the freight-house are not mere machines
doing certain things with automatic and
unvarying regularity

  they have hopes and ambitions they
take a peep out in the world and they
form opinions not always well-defined
and wise but none the less robust

  they have some bickerings some jeal-
ousies some resentments-human quali-
ties all

  all great events receive the attention
of this bunch of workers

  they wrangle in argument over  who
hit billy patterson how old is
ann and which was the first one
there peary or cook

to hear em talk youd think they had actually stayed out

some night after nine oclock


the railroad mans magazine

  they develop rank partisanship in po-
litical campaigns they are ready with
zeal and enthusiasm for anything that
comes before the public mind

  their blood teems with sporting bacilli

  they follow the various baseball
leagues and associations and every game
is analyzed and discussed

  they have their favorite clubs and
their favorite leagues and they feel and
express elation or disappointment as they
win or lose

  they banter and bet

  they  josh  one another without
much regard

  they kindle with excitement and en-
thusiasm as the race narrows

  they take sides in the post-season
games between the leaders of the big
leagues and for a week while the battle
is being waged on the diamond every de-
tail of the contest is gone over and over
within the office walls and there is wild-
eyed victory and galling defeat a hun-
dred miles away from the sniff of the
real powder

  all this fills  big sam  with disgust

   big sam  is the warehouse man i
went out on the loading platform and sat
down on a barrel

  he stopped before me and leaned
heavily on his truck and took a chew of
tobacco no mincy dudish tidbit but
a quantity like unto the raise to the barn-
loft on the hay-fork

   what do them fellers know about
sport anyway said sam jabbing his
thumb toward the freight-office with a
gesture of disgust

   they talk about baseball and cro-
quet and tiddledywinks and-  whose
got the button but they aint any of
em been within a thousand miles of real
sport

   they make me tired ive seen real
spanish torerros down at laredo why
in one afternoon  seen three bulls and
two horses killed and one matador laid
out

   then i was down at vicksburg mis-
sissippi when old john l the greatest

that ever was you bet put the fixins to
jakekilrain seventy-five rounds  talk
about sport they aint anything like
that in these days

   why them young fellers aint never
seen anything more exciting than open-
ing a bottle of pop but to hear em
talk youd think they had actually stayed
out some night until after nine oclock 
sam sneered with contempt and con-
tinued   i see by the papers this morn-
ing that the scrap-between joe halligan
and jim hackey came out just as i said
it would only -i didnt expect hackey to

 perpetual motion -the
 greatest of delusions

by e l bacon

in spite of endless failures the blind seekers of a force without a law have
gone on and on encouraged by the seeming successes of certain plausible
or ingenious impostors some of these men have hoodwinked a credu-
lous world all without achieving the slightest good with their sensational
inventions by the combined work of these apparently successful fakers not
an industrial wheel was ever turned not a moment saved not a labor light-
ened they are the chief provers of their own delusions and their own
trickery

no -orffyreus prince of perpetual motion sharps deceived princes
dukes and even scientific men until his nerve
gave way on the eve of exposure

mystery that will never
besolved was the perpet-
ual - motion machine of
jean ernest elie-bessler
orffyreus for a century
after his death in 
there were hundreds of students of the
search for self-motive power who were
convinced that he had really solved the
great problem 

  probably there are believers in him
even to this day many and many a me-
chanic has been drawn into the centuries-
old search for the impossible solely
through his belief in orffvreuss success

  he was the prince of impostors of his
time he fooled half the rulers of europe
with his mysterious wheel and it raised
him from a poor wandering showman
sometimes hooted and scoffed at by village
crowds to fame and high position

  there was no promise of what was go-
ing to happen connected with his machine

flis was a wheel that really revolved it
not only revolved but raised heavy
weights what was the source of its power

 is as much of a riddle to-day as it was in
 his own time men who really believe in
 the possibility of perpetual motion are
 likely to maintain that there was no fraud
 about it and that it was the greatest in-
 vention of all time

   try tocouvince a perpetual motion in-
 ventor of the fallacy of his idea and he
 will point to this man orffyreus and tell
 you the great secret was found two hun-
 dred years ago and lost whatever the
 secret of that famous wheel was it was
 destroyed by the inventor himself for
 with his own hands he smashed the ma-
 chine to fragments and never made an-
 other

the master mystifier

   during the year  orffyreus ap-
 peared in several villages in saxony
 where he exhibited to street crowds a
 swiftly revolving wheel which he declared
 would never stop unless interfered with
 sometimes the crowds looked upon him
 as a great genius sometimes they stoned
 him


the railroad mams magazine

  before long news of the wheel had
spread about through europe and mau-
rice william duke of saxony showed
a lively interest in it in  orffyreus
exhibited his invention before a commis-
sion selected by the duke on which were
the ducal secretary and other high state
officials and frederick hoffman a dis-
tinguished physician the commission
was convinced that perpetual motion had
at last been discovered

royal indorsement

  a few days later on november  the
duke himself came to see the wheel he
ordered the doors and windows of the
room in which it was running to be closed
and sealed and a guard was left outside

  on the th of the following january
the duke came again the seals on doors
and windows were removed and the room
was thrown open the wheel was run-
ning as fast as ever

   this surprising discovery carried abso-
lute conviction to the mind of the duke
he pledged himself under his name and
seal that the construction of the machine
was not such that it required winding up

  the inventors fame spread rapidly
after this test the emperor of austria
hearing of his achievement offered to give
herr schluter a celebrated engineer thir-
ty thousand rubles if lie would construct
a perpetual-motion machine

  herr schluter tried and failed and
died of a broken heart his son took up
the attempt but the thirty thousand ru-
bles remained unwon

  andreas gartner court model-master
of the king of poland denounced orffy-
reus as a fraud but declared that he him-
self could make a perpetual-motion ma-
chine the king gave him an order to
construct such a machine and he set to
work upon it he made a machine in
which a ball was seen to run up and down
on a wheel and thereby raise weights

a shift of patrons

   the king his ministers architects and
mechanics brought gartner into great no-
tice and a special patent was granted to
him for the protection of his invention

   in the meantime prince lord charles
landgrave of hesse had become the pa-

tron of orffyreus the inventor had been
attacked from many quarters in saxony
and for some unexplained reason the
dukes suspicions had been aroused against
him

  the landgrave installed orffyreus in
his castle of weissenstein near cassel
there the wheel was set up and exhibited
and it so pleased the landgrave that
eventually he made its inventor high
hessian councilor of commerce

  orffyreus explained his source of power
in these words

   the inward structure of the wheel is
of a nature according to the laws of me-
chanical perpetual motion so arranged
that by disposed weights once in rotation
they gain force from their own swinging
and must continue their movement as long
as their structure does not lose its posi-
tion and arrangement they are so ar-
ranged one against another that they can
never obtain equilibrium or the punctual
quietus which they unceasingly seek in
their wondrous speedy flight one or
other of them must apply its weight ver-
tically to the axis which in its turnwill
also move

a scientists approval

  surely there must have been something
wonderfully ingenious about this wheel
for when baron fischer architect to the
emperor came to cassel to inspect it he
could find no trace of any deception he
saw a wheel twelve feet in diameter re-
volving twenty-six times a minute a
cord was then tied to the axle to turn an
archimedean screw to raise water and the
wheel then revolved twenty times a min-
ute

   i then stopped the wheel with much
difficulty wrote the baron  holding on
the circumference with both hands an
attempt to stop it suddenly would raise a
man from the ground

   having stopped it in this manner it
remained stationary and here sir is
the greatest proof of a perpetual motion
i commenced the movements very gently
to see if it would of itself regain its for-
mer rapidity which i doubted believing
as they had said in london that it only
preserved for a long time the impetus of
the impulse first communicated

   but to my great astonishment i ob-
perpetual motion-the greatest of delusions 

served that the rapidity of the wheel aug-
mented little by little until it had made
two turns and then it regained its former
speed i examined well the axles of this
wheel to see if there was any hidden ar-
tifice but i was unable to see anything
more than the two small axles on which
the wheel was suspended by the center

   his highness who is a perfect mathe-
matician assured me that the machine is
so simple that a carpenters boy could un-
derstand and make it after having seen the
exterior

unproven doubts

  a woman servant declared to some in-
vestigators who had been invited to the
castle by the landgrave to inspect the ma-
chine that she had been hired by orfty-
reus to turn the wheel from an adjoining
room but baron fischer said this would
have leen impossible so said other dis-
tinguished men who had examined it

  they declared they had found not the
slightest trace of any communication with
the adjoining room the servant how-
ever after announcing that orffyreus had
threatened to strangle her if she disclosed
the secret disappeared and the inventor
himself apparently roused to fury by the
suspicions directed against him smashed
the machine into small pieces although
he lived for many years afterward he
never furnished the world with any more
clues to the mysterys solution

  europe was full of perpetual - motion
impostors for a century after orffvreuss
death there was a dramatic exposure
of one of them at frankfort in  j
geiser had been exhibiting in that city a
pendulum clock which he declared pos-
sessed self-motive power

	another fake

  a trifling accident happened to the
clock while it was on exhibition and the
inventor set about to repair the damage
he fell dead while he was tinkering with
the works while he was lying there
some mechanics investigated the interior
of his machine and discovered a concealed
winding apparatus

  in  charles readhefer of phila-
delphia came near getting a grant of
funds from the legislature of pennsyl-

vania to back his perpetual-motion pro-
ject such firm faith did the legislators
have in his revolving wheel that they ap-
pointed a committee to investigate it

  readhefer had set his wheel up in a
small building in philadelphia on the
banks of the schuylkill river when the
legislative committee arrived there they
found the doors and windows lacked

  one of the members of the committee
was nathan sellers he had brought
with him his son coleman a boy cole-
man sellers climbed up to one of the
barred windows and looked in it was
this boys sharp eyes and sharp wits that
saved the state of pennsylvania from ma-
king itself ridiculous

    i can see the machine cried the boy
 and its a fraud

	he called his father to the window and
pointed out what he had seen that result-
ed later in readhefers exposure the
machine had a set of teeth in the periphery
of the rotating table which geared into an-
other wheel whose axle was supposed to
transmit the power to some other point
where work was to be done

a child leads them

   the boy had noticed that the faces of
the teeth on the two wheels were pol-
ished by wear on the wrong sides the
boy explained that if the machine were
driven as readhefer declared it was it
would be the other sides of the teeth that
would show the wear and that the power
must come from some concealed mechan-
ism in the base

  this argument failed to convince the
committee but it led to an investigation
that resulted some time afterward in the
discovery of concealed clockwork read-
hefer who had induced many persons to
invest large sums of money in his scheme
left the state in a hurry

    i shall soon revolutionize the indus-
trial world declared john paine when
in  he exhibited his electro-magnetic
engine in newark new jersey he in-
vited several well-known scientists to
come and see his machine work they
came and watched the contrivance driving
lathes and sawing wood and went away
bewildered

  paine organized a company and sold
stock the shares were quickly gobbled
the railroad mans magazine

up and he was growing rich when one
day a committee of stockholders waited
upon him to inspect the inner workings of
the machine with the assistance of an ex-
pert

  under pretext of getting a drink the
inventor went out he never came back
it was discovered during his absence that
a belt ran from the axle of the machine
to steam power in the room below

  scores of such swindlers there have
been in this country since that time most
of them have been exposed and some are
in prison

keely ihe plausible

  none of them however ranked with
that marvel of impostors john ernest
worrell keely he it was who kept some
of the worlds greatest scientists a guess-
ing and millions of money sprang to the
assistance of his motor project during its
quarter of a century existence

  an overpowering personality was his
he possessed a phraseology as incompre-
hensible as it was beguiling he talked
of  molecular vibration  oscillation of
the atom  sympathetic equilibrium
and  quadruple negative harmonics  un-
til the average mind found its receptive
powers unequal to the occasion nobody
knew just what he was driving at but al-
most everybody who came under the spell
of his bewildering conversation believed
in him

  with a series of tuning-forks he de-
clared that he could disintegrate air and
release an etheric force rivaling a cyclone
in strength a pint of water would work
wonders before the eyes of the spectators
in his laboratory great ropes were torn
apart iron bars broken or twisted and
bullets discharged through twelve-inch
planks

the de-polar force

  with one quart of water he would be
able to send a train from philadelphia to
san francisco with a gallon he would
propel a steamship from new york to
liverpool and back

  keely declared he had discovered that
there existed polar and de-polar waves of
force if we take the compass said his
lawyer in explaining the wonderful mo-

tor  and put it near the machine the
needle will cease to be controlled by the
force that otherwise makes it point toward
the north and will turn toward the ma-
chine

   suppose you have two tuning-forks
pitched in precisely the same tone and
both giving absolutely the same sound
vibration put one  a table in one room
put the other  a table in another room

   strike one and immediately the other
will take the tone and vibrate in harmony
with it the cosmic force that carries that
vibration from one fork to the other and
makes them vibrate in harmony is the
force that keely has discovered that
force has now been harnessed

  set up in his laboratory in philadelphia
the motor was a very impressive piece of
machinery it was composed of the mo-
tor proper and the transmitter the ma-
chine rested on aheavy brass base also
there was a heavy brass sphere

musical motive-power

  between the engine and the transmitter
ran a series of wires and along the base of
the transmitter an array of steel rods bris-
tled like so many fixed bayonets these
steel rods were responsive to the touch
and compared to an ordinary musical
scale which is subject to the tuning-fork

  the interior of the globe almost defied
description but out of the complex mass
brass tubes and adhesive plates stood
prominently this was the shifting reso-
nator as keely termed it the tubes and
plates took up the vibratory sound and
carried it along with rapidity of these
vibrations there were seven distinct kinds
said keely each of the seven capable of
infinitesimal division

  the motor itself consisted of a heavy
iron hoop placed firmly on the plate
within this hoop ran a drum with eight
spokes when it was once in operation
the movements of the drum were very
rapid the harmonics were supposed to
start the machinery by  etheric force

exposed but still puzzling

  to the day of his death when he had
kept up the deception for a quarter of a
century his stockholders held their faith
in him it was not until several weeks
perpetual motion-the greatest of delusions 

afterward when late on a winters night
in  the walls and flooring of his lab-
oratory were ripped up and secret tubes
discovered that they realized the colossal
fraud

   even to this day nobody is quite sure
 whether it was compressed air or some
 other force that keely brought through
 those tubes

  in even greater numbers than the
frauds are the tragedies that mark the
long road to this unattainable goal in
 a distinguished-looking old man
john kreyezich a cabinetmaker by trade
went to live in a poor little room at no
 fourteenth street hoboken

   he paid one dollar and fifty cents a
week for his room and not only slept and
prepared his own meals in it but used it
as a work-shop his food was of the
poorest sort and his clothes were thread-
bare all day and until late into the night
he could be heard sawing and hammering
at his carpenters bench

tragedies of futility

    some day he told his landlady  i
 shall make millions  shall make heat
 light and cold i shall drive steamships
 and railroad trains i shall revolutionize
 industry my machine on which i am
 working will run without fuel and will
 never stop

   he never allowed anybody in his room
 he was afraid he explained that his
 great invention would be stolen

  seven long years lie hammered and
sawed and then one day two strangers
said to be rich promoters from boston
called on him after that every week for
one year they sent him ten dollars and he
bought a new suit of clothes and ate a lit-
tle more regularly then the remittances
stopped

 they got tired he told his landlady

  they wanted their millions too quickly
 ah theyll have nothing now 

  three more years went by one eve-
ning it occurred to the landlady that she
had not seen the old man for several days
she went to his door and knocked there
was no reply she tried to open it it
was locked

   then she called in a policeman and the
 door was broken open i-ying against a
 great wheel surmounting a mass of ma-

 chinery was the old man dead his stif-
 fened fingers gripping a tangle of wires

   the big wheel hung on a steel axle with
 which the wires had seemed to have some
 important connection fastened to the
 wheels circumference at regular dis-
 tances apart were a number of buckets
 and at the base of the wheel was a tub of
 water

   nobody knew where the old inventor
had come from and they buried him in
potters field

a railroad mans ruin

   charles heiner was a machinist em-
ployed in the roundhouse of the new york
central railroad at mott haven and
lived with his wife in a flat at no 
east one hundred and forty-fifth
street new york for twenty-five years
he had spent most of his spare time work-
ing on a machine that he expected would
give perpetual motion every night after
dinner he would go to his room and tinker
with his array of wheels and cogs and
chains

    i shall be rich and famous some day
 he told his wife

   she had unbounded faith in him and
encouraged him when sometimes his
spirits flagged one day in  he lost
his position he gave his bank deposit
of a few hundred dollars to his wife and
went to work with desperate energy on his
machine he must solve the great prob-
lem before his savings were spent

   the months went by and thfc bank ac-
count was almost exhausted but still the
wheels would not go

   after dinner one day he said to his
wife  im tired out and shant do any
work to-night he carefully covered up
his wheels and chains and went to bed

   in the morning she found him hanging
dead from a rope tied to the apex of his
machine when some machinists who had
known him investigated the contrivance
on which he had toiled for so many years
they found that evidently the whole com-
plex arrangement was based on the idea
of the overbalancing wheel

  the despair of weariness

in cleveland in  b f eibler
was found one morning dead in his work-


the railroad mans magazine

shop with poison beside him for two
years he had been working night and day
over a mysterious machine he had never
explained to anybody what it was going
to be but just before taking the poison
he wrote a letter in which lie told of a
fruitless struggle to invent an attachment
for electric automobiles in which the elec-
tricity used in running the motor-car
would be replaced with power generated
by the car itself

  in  a handsome young syrian was
among the students who were taking the
course in mechanical engineering at co-
lumbia university he was basile saheb
who had come to this country three years
before and had been living at no 
west one hundred and eleventh street
there he had fitted up a little laboratory
where he worked every evening until mid-
night on a perpetual-motion machine

  one morning a shot rang out from the
laboratory and there was the sound of a
heavy fall on the floor some of the
startled lodgers in the house rushed to the
students door and found him lying dead
against the bed strewn across the floor
was a mass of pulleys valves levers cog-
wheels and chains he had smashed his
machine to pieces

an old mans awakening

  in the summer of the same year will-
iam herford an old carpenter in will-
iamsburg committed suicide in his work-
shop at no  ellery street for thirty
years he fiad tried to find perpetual mo-
tion two weeks before his death he told
his wife that he realized at last that his
long search had been hopeless and that
he had wasted his life on a delusion

  all his money he had spent on his ma-
chine and left scarce enough to bury him
it was a most complex contrivance that
he left behind him so complex in fact
that nobody could understand on what
lines he had been working

  as pathetic as any of these tragedies
was the story of adolf schaap an old
hungarian he came to america from
his native country when a young man and
became a thrifty ironworker he married
and had children and his home was a
happy and prosperous one

and then somehow the delusion of

the

perpetual motion got into his brain and
drove him on to ruin he gave up his
job as an ironworker and spent all his
time constructing a machine to carry out
his ambition

   before long the family treasury ran
empty and there was no food in the house
yet he could not be persuaded to leave his
machine

worst form of the mania

  never mind he cried we can
starve for a while well soon have money
enough  well have millions

  before another week had passed his
wife had left him taking the children
with her the landlord put him out of
his home for the rent was long overdue
schaap picked up his few belongings and
his machine and went to live in a room
at no  east fifty-fourth street

   there he stayed and worked on his ma-
chine for years sometimes he found an
odd job and made enough money to tide
him along but most of the time he was
hammering away in his room

   very carefully he guarded his secret
for nobody was ever allowed within his
door the fear that some one might steal
his invention always worried him

   one day in  the landlady of the
place who had noticed that the old man
had been growing very thin and white
and had gone out very seldom for weeks
went to his room to offer him some food
receiving no answer to her knock she
pushed the door open and caught a
glimpse of him in his big armchair ga-
zing abstractedly at a machine that was
racing about his room

weak guardian of nothing

  the next moment he caught sight of
her and jumping to his feet and pointing
to the door he shouted angrily  go 

   but the kind-hearted landlady felt sure
that her lodger had not eaten for days
and she appealed in his behalf to the char-
ity organization society it was found
that the old man was sick and unable to
walk and he was taken to bellevue hos-
pital he did not live very long after
ward and he died a pauper but to his
last hour he held faith in his machine
end
uw a ur fifteen days the sidings
             at bareen had been filling
             with all manner of cars
             the yards had become a
             sink into which all man-
             ner of freight drifted and
             stayed it was a real blockade

  henderson the yardmaster whose duty
it was to keep the traffic moving had
looked on the forming blockade with the
same feeling that another man might have
watched flames eating upon his fortunes
he knew that when a blockade becomes
absolute a railroad quits the business of
transportation and goes to chopping off
heads and cleaning house his head was
on the block

  to make matters worse henderson had
no more to do with that blockade than you
or i patterson division superintendent
at bareen son-in-law to old macready
the general manager of the g and t 
patterson whose only knowledge of his
position consisted in the fact that he had
authority and was the author of the
tangle

  now everybody in the employ of the
g and t knew that macready who was
hard as flint would have dared the hand
of god for the sake of patterson and
patterson had a habit of snatching up the



laurels from the brows of those below
and replacing them with the dunce-caps
that he himself had earned that was the
situation

  if henderson had been a hereditary
yardmaster as patterson had been a he-
reditary superintendent it wouldnt have
made any difference that would simply
have been a ease of dog eat dog and the
best one win with perhaps the rare good
luck of both of them being eaten

  but henderson had begun railroading
as a section-hand and having worked like
a horse for six years he had won the pro-
motion of foreman six more years and
they made him a track inspector at that
rate he would have been a thousand years
old before he got anywhere

  of course that shouldnt have made
any difference henderson was only hen-
derson even if he had forgotten more
about railroading in any five minutes of
his railroad career than the average super-
intendent ever knew or ever would know 
though he had a good brain a good brave
heart and the will to lay down his life in
the days work it should have satisfied
him to maul rail-spikes through all the
years of his prime and then wind up his
days as a bridge-tender or a crossing flag-
man

the bareen
blockade

by j r stafford



a real man goes through the fire
before he is admitted to be pure gold


the railroad mans magazine

  a man ought to be contented and keep
out of trouble but henderson had not
been contented having mastered the de-
tails of ever job of which he could learn
anything lie had spent years wondering
why the deuce ignoramuses of twenty
years inexperience got to be heads of de-
partments

   at last the day arrived as it always will
when his knowledge came to his hand like
forgotten money in a cast-off suit of
clothes he rectified an error of patter-
sons that would have cost the g and 
the loss of two fast trains and damage-
suits for no telling how many human lives
wherefore on the day he was forty he
had become yardmaster at bareen

  what that promotion meant to hen-
derson is not given all men to realize his
father was a cripple and his mother old
and worn out and he loved a woman who
returned his love and waited for him

  of course that was all nonsense he
could have sent the old people olt to the
poorhouse and he and the woman could
have lived handsomely on a track inspec-
tors pay or he could have been an op-
timist and married and the whole family
could have got along swimmingly on his
forty dollars a month unless something
happened to him when all of them could
have gone to the county farm

  as yardmaster he was to draw better
than a hundred a month was to draw
because as yet he had not drawn pay on
the new job

  the blockade began the day after he
had assumed his new duties now it was
all swept away he would be a dead dog
the minute old macready arrived

  pie would be dead everywhere too for
the newspapers had made a sensation of
the blockade and had featured it with
photographs and interviews with patter-
son when the whole business was ended
on the g and t his career as a rail-
roader would be finished

  whenever henderson thought of the
injustice of it he wanted to take a claw-
bar and beat the superintendent to deatli

  on the evening of the fifteenth day
old macready got down from a high-
speed engine in front of the switch shan-
ty and began giving impossible orders

   take out those fruit-cars on siding
twenty-four and send them back east
local

  siding twenty - four was a switch of
twenty-three and twenty-three was full
clear up to twenty-two

   you mean henderson corrected
 to take out the junk in twenty other
sidins first sos to git to twenty-four
what the deuce is to be done with them
thousand-odd cars thats first got to be
moved  

  macready knew that well enough any-
how henderson should have bowed to
the position and kept his mouth shut to
the man positions are to be respected

  he got proof positive of it next morn-
ing when he went up to the despatch-
ers office for orders he received his dis-
charge instead and while this was being
handed out to him he heard macready
dictating an interview for the papers
which would show that the blockade was
the fault of the yardmaster alone

  henderson walked down the alley be-
tween two lines of cars reeling like a
drunken man there are poisons that in-
toxicate more terribly than whisky and of
these he had drunk because he had been
forced to drink

  coming to a certain point he crawled
under many lines of cars and came out on
the edge of the yards opposite a little cot-
tage that lay just beyond the right of way
it was his home that was not paid for
now it would soon be some one elses

  he looked beyond the cottage up the
long slope on which bareen the city stood
bareen would be his no more either he
went in and his father asked him   what
will ye do now 

  yes what would he do hepderson
knew that when a man of forty loses his
trade he goes either to the scrap-heap of
common labor or the dumps of crime

  of course that should not necessarily
be true a man should look on the bright
side of misfortune bur he knew that he
was deserving and that he had been com-
pelled to bear the stigma of another mans
incompetence

  he knew that the good men who go
down under the ignorance of fools in
authority are numberless the point of
it pricked him to madness he got his
pistol and went back to the despatchers
office patterson white-faced and sneak-
ing met him at the door x

   ive come to square things with ye
henderson declared
the bareen blockade



  macready jumped from his seat at the
despatchers elbow and ran in between
square things he shouted youve
tied the line and now you threaten ill
have you locked up

   i never tied the line the man that
says i did is a liar  and
henderson shook his fist in
the general managers face

  now macready for all
he had the stubbornness of a
mule knew the difference be-
tween a bluff and a chal-
lenge so he made a show of
interest by asking  then
who did do it 

   you  the answer came
like a shot you done it

you put this dub in here
when you knowed what he
was you knowed he
wouldnt do he made me
shunt through freight to the
back sidins the first day
and he kep it up

   you knowed he was a
fool who wanted all the
authority coming to him
even to sayin how the
switchmen should trim and
set the lamps but thats
neither here nor there

   its nothin to me that
he tied up the line i
couldnt help it that was
your fault and more yourn
than his but lemme tell ye
it is his fault that hes laid
the blame on me hes a
low-lived cur and you that
back him is no better

  as he choked out the last
words henderson jerked his
pistol and fired pointblank at
pattersons head the shot
went wild but the fist of fighting old
macready went home on the point of
hendersons jaw

   ill have you in the penitentiary for
this the general manager bellowed
 johnson call the police 

  now johnson the despatches knew a
great many things this was his answer
 mr macreadyif you arrest him therell
have to be a trial if theres a trial the
facts will have to come out the facts
whl hurt patterson has ruined this fel-

low and nothing else can be made of it
id have to swear to that

  being mundane the affairs of men con-
sists in artions and corresponding reac-
tions half the business of life with many
people consists in keeping one set of facts

in the spot-light and the other set clear off
the stage

  macready let go his hold on hender-
sons arm and collar disarmed him and
told him to make himself scarce in ex-
actly the same spirit the would-be slayer
slunk down the stairs and down the
gloomy alley of the cars toward home
he went into the house and stumbling
into his own room flung himself down on
his bed like a maimed dog come home to
his kennel to die


the railroad mans magazine

  for a quarter of an hour he gazed dully
at the wall and thought of nothing but
the cracking in the back of his head and
the clutch of the unseen hands upon his
throat presently the quavering voice of
his father repeatedly calling aroused him
there was intensity in the old mans voice

  he listened for
the words and
caught the
yards are all
afire  with a
kind of grim hope
he jumped up
and ran out the
yards were hid-
den under black
clouds of rolling
smoke

  a gust swept
the murk toward
him and his eyes
smarted from the
fumes he
smiled for it was
pleasing to think
that macready
would have to an-
swer for a thou-
sand cars all
turned to scrap
and smoke then
the gust steadied
to a blast and
the paint on the
porch pillar at his
side blistered and
crinkled in the
driven heat

  he dashed into
the house and
catching up his
father carried him to the street that led
up the slope toward town his mother
followed him they had not gone half a
block when they looked back and saw the
roof smoke and then burst into flame

  a fire-engine dashed past going whence
they had come it was followed by dense
crowds but henderson had not made
two blocks when the same rabbl-e came
running back and he heard them crying
 bareen will be burned to the ground

  the thought of it caught and held his
attention bareen the town he had loved
all his life like him was to be made a
sacrifice to the folly of the fools who ran

the g and t as he hesitated a city fire-
man came running by henderson
grabbed him by the arm and - demanded
 what are ye runnin for 

    its a deatji-trap the man under the
helmet answered  an i haint a goin to
stay to git burned up the railroad com-

pnys in a row
with their switch-
in help and they
cant git a wheel
turned to move
them cars the
towns a burnin
on this side its
sure death to stay
between and
he d es e r t e r
 renclied himself
free -and dashed
away

 henderson
looked back
where the smoke-
clouds lifting for
a moment dis-
closed that only
the cars of the
first siding were
on fire he beck-
oned a passing
townsman and
said to him

   mister im a
goin back to bust
that blockade
will ye see that
my ole daddy an
my mother are
kept out of the
av a y of the
crowds an the
fire if i dont make it back theyll be
some life-insurance coinin to em on me
i ask ye as one man to anotherll to see
they git it before the other could an-
swer he was gone

  back he sped through the surging
crowds and on past those devoted firemen
who would run not fie saw that their
playing streams burst into steam-clouds
before they touched the walls and he
knew that the heat before him was yet
more terrific	 -

  he dreav a deep breath and plunged on
fie stumbled blindly through his own
gate to the right of way and he thought

macready would have to answer fcr  thousand
cars alt- turned to scrap
the bareen blockade



of it as the gate to hades he bounded
down a burning alleyway that would save
a quarter of a mile on the eternal way to
the roundhouse and came out at last with
his clothing on fire

  down the lee side of the inferno he
raced like an olympic runner in the first
lap but at the end of his course where 
he should have received the cheers of
switchmen he got nothing but the mock-
ery of locked doors and silence the
roundhouse was deserted

  another man might have laid down
what could one man alone do he could
handle one engine and one string of cars
and while he was doing that six other
strings of cars would be catching fire

  but henderson had fought for six years
to become a section-foreman and a man
who will do that lies down to no task the
issue of which is to be had in half an
hour he caught up a coupling-pin and
beat the padlock from the door of the first
stall

  inside  the ribs of the fan-shaped
floor stood six engines with fires all
banked and steam in the boilers running
low he opened drafts started injectors
shoveled coal and then taking a coal
hammer went outside and smashed more
locks by the time the last door swung
open the roundhouse was a pandemonium
of screeching safety-valves

  one by one he ran the moguls out onto
the main track coupling them together
he shot down to the switch which opened
off to siding one the cars on that line
had by this time been burning for so long
a time that their beams and sills had
sagged clear down to the rails that
string could never be moved and he knew
better than to waste time trying it

  he bumped onto the next switch and
looked down the windrow of fire there
was no use trying that one either he was
now well into the breath of the conflagra-
tion  yet he knew he must penetrate more
deeply and that the work after he got
there would be work for more than man

   but he steamed  down to siding three
and groping in the smudge saw that the
sills of the cars on that string were as yet
intact though all the woodwork above
was in a blaze he cut off his head en-
gine ran down the main line and then
backed up against the end of the burning
car

  the skin of his hands and the hair of
his head were gone when he finished that
coupling he got that string under way
and then opened his throttle to the last
notch and jumped to the ground that
siding full of box cars went out of there
like a snake on fire

  henderson grinned as it went by and
bumped  down to siding four that
string was easier for as yet the cars near
the end had not begun to burn as before
he coupled up made a big head of steam
and when he had the mogul under way
opened the throttle to the last notch and
jumping off watched that section of the
conflagration speed off in the wake of the
first

  after that his breath came easier for
siding four was the last to open directly
to the main line siding five opened from
four six from five and so on all the way
to twenty

  however what had been done before
was boys play to what must now be done
it was necessary to run far back into the
zone of the first of the fire where the em-
ber-spewing debris of sidings one and two
threw out tremendous heat

  now when he backed his third engine
down to couple in on the string on five he
knew there was no use trying it but he
hooked up and of course stuck he got
down and saw that half the sills were al-
ready sagging to the ties

  then a draw-head pulled loose and he
came bucking out with two cars two
cars would not let him back to six he
slowed up and went back no coupling
could be made at all

  now it was that henderson yielded to
the last frenzy of his purpose he cut
loose went back to the main line and
hitched onto the other three engines
having run them out onto the main line
beyond the switch to siding four he went
back and set the other switches so that the
main line ran direct to five

  then he got aboard and ran down the
track for a quarter of a mile or more
there he stopped and built such fires un-
der those boilers as would make steam
faster than any safety-valve could let it
off

  this done he crawled up into the cab
of the head engine reversed it opened
the throttle to the last notch and then as
the giant went plunging back he jumped


the railroad mans magazine

back and got to the next mogul behind
there he did the same thing then he
made his way to the next one and the
next and by the time he had reached the
last one the four moguls in tandem were
sweeping back at forty miles an hour and
every boiler straining at its rivet-heads

  henderson sat in the head of his batter-
ing-ram and pulled his throttle-lever to
the bracket to give her a little more steam
he was going to sweep that siding of its
gutted cars

  of course only fools court death in
such a fashion but once in a while a
fool jumps up and the world for ten gen-
erations afterward wonders at him the
head tender crumpled the cab in which
henderson sat but siding five started and
went out half of it dragging on the rails

  as for henderson some timber or
something struck and flipped him back
onto the coal old macready and john-
son sitting at the despatchers window
looked out and saw him lying there as
the roaring skid of wreck toiled by them

  the two fell over each other going
down the stairs and raced like a pair of
hounds till they caught the pilot of the
last of the toiling moguls then they got
aboard and shut down

  by the time they had the last engine
under control henderson had regained
consciousness by that time too all the
switchmen who had refused to go out un-
der the boss appointed that morning had
gathered around

  macready yelled at them   take these
engines and clean out those yards its
easy now

  but even if it was easy not a man
stirred until henderson gave the order

  nowadays if you go anywhere on the
g and t anybody can tell you all about
henderson and the bareen blockade
they cannot tell you much about patter-
son however for small men like small
coins are soon spent and forgotten if
you will go to bareen you will either find
henderson in the superintendents office
which he now fills or elseat his home

n y centrals new pension scheme

president w  brown of the
new york central and hudson river
railroad lately announced that three of
the railroads in the central system would
begin paying pensions to their retiring em-
ployees from the first day of this year

  the pension plan will affect about 
of the employees of the central and affiliated
lines it will involve the payment of about
 a year employees of- the new
york central and hudson river railroad
company the lake shore and michigan
southern railroad company and the michi-
gan central railroad company will be eligi-
ble under certain conditions for the pen-
sions under the present plan

  employees of the pittsburgh and lake
erie and the other lines of the central
system will not be eligible

  under the plan as adopted employees on
reaching the age of seventy years are re-
tired if they have been continuously in
the service of the company for at least ten
years immediately preceding their retire-
ment they will be entitled to a pension

  an employee who has been at least twenty
years in continuous service and has become
unfit for duty may be retired with a pension
although he has not reached the age of
seventy years

  the amount of the pension as explained
is one per cent for each continuous year of
service of the employees average annual
wage during the ten years before his retire-
ment

  a conductor who has been earning 
during the ten years before his retirement
and who has been in the companys employ
for twenty consecutive years would thus re-
ceive twenty per cent of his annual 
salary or  a year for the rest of his
life if the same conductor had been thirty
years in the service he would get  a
year if he had been forty years in the com-
panys service he would get 

  a brakeman who had been earning  a
year for ten years and who had been twenty
years in the service would get  a ear
for the rest of his life

 a trainman who had reached the age of
seventy years and who had been ten con-
secutive years in the service would get
ten per cent of the average annual wage
which he had been receiving during that--
time

  the pension system will reach from the
lowest to the highest employee throughout
the central system on january  
men were scheduled to receive old-age pen-
sions according to the plan

the other half

in the happy silence his lips met
hers his arms held her close

   oh i am so glad  she
  whispered  so glad  

    and jack could only kiss
her lips again but even in
her happiness she could not long forget
her errand hastily she told him what
had happened-the decision to blow up
the sluices her fruitless effort to keep
the men back

   and then i went to the stable and
got freia and rode down to tell you
she ended

   jack by the light of the unbroken lan-
tern glanced at the leathery flanks of
the mare he observed for the first
time that there was no saddle fie made
no comment she had done no more
than he knowing her would have ex-
pected but he shuddered as he thought
of the risks she must have run and he
thanked god silently that she had come
through safely

  a light was bobbing down the bridle-
path larry and mary were coming
they stopped amazed a few feet away
looking from the steaming horse to the
picture of a strange girl with golden hair
whose head lay  jacks shoulder

   larry-mary said jack  this is
tbekla wist who is to be my wife

   thekla raised her head she was neither
timid nor embarrassed - just frankly
happy jack briefly told the story that
she had come to tell

began in the october  railroad ma

 r r	

    you mustnt blame them too much
said thekla earnestly  they dont un-
derstand

     dont blame them at all replied
larry  i blame the persons who have
lied to them

   flis face looked very gray fie and
jack could understand now the full
subtlety of briggss treachery no such
clumsy device as a strike was solely to
be relied upon to make the work fail
the purpose of the strike was merely to
get the workmen out of the way in order
that a foul blowmight be aimed at the
dam itself

   they both felt as though they should
have guessed as much in the case of a
strike with three days of leeway left to
them briggs would know that they might
pick enough men to finish the job 
time of course he would have some
surer trick in his pocket and it would be
impossible to prove any connection be-
tween thomas briggs the denver capi-
talist and the mad suspicion of a group
of norwegian farmers

  the end seemed to have come what
could they do to keep the men of the
valley from the dam to try to hold
them back with revolvers would be futile
and absurd two men could not guard
all the sluices that dark night and the
norwegians were not the kind to be
easily frightened

  to reason with them what good
would that do they had already shown
thatthey were not amenable to reason
yet to meet them as they came and to
attempt to parley with them was after
all the only plan that could be followed

ns magazine single copies  cents


the railroad mans magazine

and with no hope of success that is
what they decided to do

  presently they heard the distant rum-
ble of the wagons louder and louder
it became and larry and jack smiled at
each other and at thekla and mary in
a last grim effort at reassurance jack
took out his broken shilling

   if there is such a thing as luck he
said  were goint to need it now

   hold on to it tight said mary

   what is it jack asked thekla

   just a lucky piece do you want to
go to the shack out of view before the
wagons come

   i want to stay here near you jack
  he kissed her without shame

  so the wagons came rattling around
the nearest curve and at sight of the bar-
rier and the two men and two women
who stood before it the driver reined in
his teams

  let me start things said jack to
larry but be ready to get into the
game if i make any breaks

  tack therefore stepped forward and
called mr wist

  the norwegians were already getting
to the ground and at the sound of jacks
voice peter wist shouldered his way to
the front his glance fell angrily on
jack then he saw thekla advancing
to jacks side and he started

   thekla  he muttered

   yes father  she answered bravely
 wait dear  jack whispered then
he addressed himself again to the lower-
ing man before him

   mr wist he began quietly  we
know why you have come there are
not enough men in the camp to oppose
you but before you do what you have
planned to do i want to tell you some-
thing i want you to hear the real rea-
son why you have been made to believe
that our company meant to injure you
thats a fair request isnt it

  peter wist did not answer at once
outraged by what he considered his
daughters treachery bewildered by the
fact of her presence he hardly heard
tacks words how had thekla whom
he had left at the house managed to
get to the dam ahead of the wagons

  then freia whinnied somewhere in
the darkness near by and peter wist un-
derstood he realized that the girl had

 ridden the mare through the night slip-
 ping by the wagons somewhere along the
 road and had come at the risk of her
 own- life to warn her lover against her
 father

   he realized that his victory over jack
 marly that afternoon in the field-was
 it only a day ago-had been a sorry
 victory after ail he even realized that
 from now  thekla was committed by
 her own act to consider her lover first
 her father second the pain of these
 revelations was sharp in him

   the men were beginning to murmur
 will you listen to me jack re-
 peated

    to the dam  shouted ole knudsen
 hoarsely his dull eyes had flamed with
 rage at the sight of thekla

   others among the norwegians took up
 - the cry to the dam to thedam 
 peter wist had felt no change in his
 resolution he had himself been at the
 point of ignoring jack and larry ignor-
 ing his daughter and pushing on to the
 sluices but unruliness among his fol-
 lowers was something that he would not
 brook as they surged around him
 threatening to hurry on without authority
 he turned to them and ordered them back

    be silent lie cried there is
 time enough we will hear what this
 man has to say

    dont listen to him  yelled ole
 knudsen rushing forward  thekla
 lias bewitched him  come on men 
 peter wist did not hesitate one step
 and his huge fist caught the oncoming
 rebel squarely  the mouth and sent him
 staggering back

    there  shouted wist stamping
 with rage  will you disobey me be
 silent all of you he glared at his
 men two of them were holding ole
 knudsen then he turned again to
 jack

    say what you have to say but say
 it quickly he ordered

    mr smith and i -jack indicated
 larry by a nod- own between us a
 half interest in this property the other
 half is owned by aaron garth do you
 know aaron garth mr wist

    yes i know him

    do vou know that he is a hard
 man

    yes  know that
the dam-builders

s

   to get the money to build the dam
jack went on  we had to mortgage this
property to a friend of aaron garths
we knew that we should not be able to
pay the mortgage when it fell due and
he said that he would renew it if- he
paused to make his facts impressive-
 if we would have all our work done by
the date when the mortgage comes due
that date is one week from to-day

   this has nothing to do with us ex-
claimed wist

  wait we have found that the man
who holds our mortgage is a bad man
he wanted us to think that he would
renew the mortgage he talked fair but
really he wants us to fail so that he can
foreclose the mortgage and thus get pos-
session of our property for a great deal
less than it is worth

   he has secretly interfered with our
work we have reason to think that he
bribed our contractor to slow down just
when we needed to hurry we have rea-
son to think that he hired a labor leader
to come here and persuade the workmen
to strike to-night we are without la-
borers and unless the dam is finished by
next saturday mr smith and  are
ruined

  now there is one other thing we
have reason to think that the rumor that
we planned to flood your valley was start-
ed by our enemy just to make you angry
so that you would do what you intended
to do to-night if you destroy the sluices
you will be doing his work

   is that all asked wist he seemed
to be unmoved

   not quite mr wist your daughter
thekla is going to be my wife do you
think that  bound to you by such a tie
loving her who loves you-do you think
that i would stand for the flooding of
your farm	

  wist shrugged his shoulder

   if you help to ruin us our enemy
will have possession of the dam you
will find him a worse man to deal with
than we are

  wist made an impatient movement

 you have said enough   he exclaimed

 what we know we know you are the
robbers and destroyers not we come
men 

  they surged up about their leader
these vikings of the modern age they

were hot and eager the flames of their
rage burned brightly jack disheart-
ened stood back he had done all that
he could do even larry who had kept
himself in the background realized that
no more could wisely be said

  but thekla with exalted courage
moved forward to bar the way jack
drew her back  dont he whispered
 its no use let them go

   oh they must not-they must not 
she sobbed  for their own sake too
they must not 

  jack smiled sadly luck is against
us dear lie said  i had thought that
there might be something in luck for us
see what  have held in my hand all the
time he showed the broken shilling in
his left palm  it did no good now
i will throw it away

  his motion was arrested thekla had
clutched his wrist with staring eyes
she bent over the broken coin father
she cried father quick

  peter wist involuntarily halted and
looked his daughter had snatched
something from jack marlys hand she
was holding it up between her thumb and
finger her eyes were wild with excite-
ment

   the other half of the shilling  she
cried  the other half of the shilling 
with a hoarse cry wist seized the coin
and dropped to his knees beside a lantern
presently he began plucking at his throat
he got hold of a string and drew from
its place of concealment under his shirt
a small leather bag polished smooth by
years of contact with his skin

  tremblingly he opened it zfiid took
out a bit of tarnished silver jack bend-
ing down saw that it was a fragment of
a coin

  the two pieces lay together in the
norwegians palm he pushed them
together the broken edges fitted to
form one perfect circle

  wist closing his hand on the shilling
got slowly to his feet his face was
working strangely and he fixed his burn-
ing eyes on jacks

  where did it come from he de-
manded  how did it get to your
hands

   i found it

   but where did you find it who
lost it


the railroad mans magazine

  jack dreaded to speak if the coin
were an old token of friendship between
peter wist and thomas briggs the situa-
tion might be the worse for its discovery
wist might realize from what he had al-
ready heard that to injure the dam would
be to help the man to whom the other
half of the coin had belonged

  hesitating jack looked at thekla it
would be a simple thing to say that he
did not know who had lost the coin wist
would not know that he really knew
thekla would not know but he could
not look into her blue eyes and tell the
lie harmless though it seemed

  where did you get it wist whis-
pered the man was tense with emo-
tions which he was struggling to control

   i saw a man drop it and i picked
it up and kept it

   who was the man who was he
 the man was the holder of the mort-
gage on this property-my enemy

   his name his name 

   thomas briggs

  peter wist exclaimed aloud and raised
his shaking hand

   your enemy  he cried  your en-
emy and nunc 

chapter xv
the turn of the tide

t t is hand grasped jacks arm  your
enemy-and mine  he repeated
 my son i believe you now  believe
you now back men we will not
touch the dam this man has spoken
truth to us he has proved it 

  his excited authority his unusual ve-
hemence drove the norwegians to won-
der they clustered around him cu-
riously-among them ole knudsen who
evidently had accepted the leaders disci-
pline though from the row of his yellow
teeth one was missing where wists
knuckle had struck they muttered ex-
citedly in norse for many of them had
known the history of the token that hung
about peter wists neek

  several minutes of confusion passed
before thekla was able to get her fathers
attention at last however she pointed
out to him that jack did not know the
meaning of this sudden change of heart
then tensely peter wist told the story

in his clean straight english without
faltering once

   when i was your age lie said to
jack   came to tiie western mountains
to hunt for a fortune i met another lad
-a sharp-faced wiry lad-named thom-
as briggs we became friends and part-
ners

   each of us had saved a few hundred
dollars and putting the money all to-
gether we went to a new mining-camp
and opened a restaurant we made much
money-more than the majority of the
seekers after gold at the end of a year
we had six thousand dollars hidden safely
away

   thomas briggs was an english boy
he had a shilling which he carried for
luck when we became partners he
broke the shilling into two pieces and
gave me one and we swore to keep them
as tokens that we would be faithful to
each other i made this leather bag and
put my half of the shilling in it ever
since have i worn it

   then the camp began to play out
the gold-hunters were drifting away
so we made less money and at last we
decided to stop our restaurant and go to
another place

   then when i woke up one morning
thomas briggs was gone  went to the
place where we had hid our money the
money was gone too

  he stopped and for some time busied
himself with his own grim thoughts

   i have trusted no man since he
added at last  i have always worn mv
token to remind me that i must trust no
man many years later i found thomas
briggs in denver he was rich

   when i went to his house and asked
him for the money he had stolen he
laughed he said i could not prove that
lie had stolen it so  struck him he
had his servants throw me out of the door

  after that i wanted to kill him but
that would not do and i tried to forget
everything except that no man could be
trusted i went back to minnesota and
manv years later i came here that is
all

  a plain bold story but no less tragic
for the brevity of its telling a wronged
man had nursed his bitterness for more
than thirty years while the man who had
wronged him continued to prosper not
the dam-builders



uncommon perhaps but in the slow rev-
olutions of the vlieel of fate justice
eventually is done

chapter xvi
on the dam

thekla had drawn her father
aside they were talking in low
tones-she all eagerness while he ap-
parently listened at first with doubt and
reluctance and gradually began to nod
his agreement with what she was saying

   she called to jack and when he had
stepped over to where she and her father
stood she said  the men of the valley
will finish the dam for you jack

  can they do it jack was amazed
at this turn of the situation

   we know how to mix cement and
build walls said peter wist  if you
will tell us where to lay the stones we
will place them as you wish

   larry was summoned his face light-
ed up when the news was given to him
but he shook his head disappointedly as
he made a rapid count of the men avail-
able  thirty-five only he muttered

 it would take fifty men five days

 i can get more men said wist

 these can remain here-all except one
him i must send back to the valley to
look after matters there you can give
us the tents where your men have slept
and to-morrow morning we can begin
work i myself will go to my people at
larkin city and they will help

   thus it was ordered ole knudsen was
sent back to the valley the other men
took up the quarters which the strikers
had left vacant they were at first in-
clined to grumble but the promise of
high pay made them quiet

   late into the night larry talked with
peter wist he showed him the maps
and charts  without great difficulty
now that suspicion had been killed he
made it plain that the farms of the nor-
wegians were not to be endangered

  meantime thekla and jack wandered
together up and down the lower road
the heavy clouds had been blown away
by a wind and the stars gave them light
enough to see the gladness in each others 
eyes as they said sweet words over and
over again

   it was late when he took her up to the
shack and gave her over to mary nev-
ertheless he returned alone to the lower
road and for an hour retraced the steps
he had taken with her

  in the morning the work began the
sturdy northmen adapting themselves to
the more or less unfamiliar labor went
at it with a vim that raised the hopes of
larry jack had insisted on taking his
place among them larry oversaw the
work with the help of jones and armsby
and ives who had returned

   in the afternoon peter wist came back
from larkin city with the wagons loaded
down with forty more norwegians-all
eager for the double pay oneill had
tried to stop them but they would not
listen to him

   so the work fared  through the early
days of the week the engines puffed
the great derricks swung their burdens
into the air and hammer and trowel
clinked merrily

  on monday bill murdock appeared
threatening trouble because larry was
using his camp outfit and his tools larry
drove him off with a threat of a thrash-
ing

  on tuesday morning came aaron
garth with uneasy protests against the
way things were going the hint of a
suit for conspiracy sent him hurrying
back to town

  the same afternoon came oneill at
peter wists command half a-dozen nor-
wegians left their work long enough to
throw him into the stream whence he
emerged much sobered to make his wet
way down the canon

   meantime course after course was laid
on the dam until when work stopped
wednesday night larry announced that
half a day would see all done

  thekla and mary had found plenty to
do on monday thekla had ridden up
to the valley to get her medicine-case and
her surgical instruments where many
men are at work accidents will happen
and she found considerable use for her
rolls of bandages

  mary supervised the camp kitchen in
which wing fal showed himself general
and army in one indeed there were no
idlers in the camp

  thursday morning the men streamed
up to their work with evidences of the


the railroad mans magazine

excitement they felt the spirit of the
battle against time had penetrated them
and they were a unit in their interest and
enthusiasm

  overnight larry had had the sluices
closed and the water was beginning to
collect behind the dam but even the
widening lake between them and the val-
ley did not arouse the dead suspicions of
the northmen they were keyed to their
fight to get the work done

  stone by stone the last course was laid
the derricks creaked and groaned the
men grunted and panted stone by
stone and ever the lake behind the dam
grew longer

  the sky was clear the sun was hot the
sweat rolled down the faces of the toiling
men but they ran to and fro with ex-
hausting eagerness three hours longer
-two hours-one hour-

  at half past eleven the last stone was
ready to be dropped into its position
larry - a relieved smile on his face -
raised his hand

   jack  he called

  all wet and grimy jack came forward
 this is your job said larry  you
must lay the last stone

  jack shook his head  thats for you
old man im only a private

   but i insist

   then let mary do it

  if you say mary and thekla i will
agree replied larry

  mary and thekla therefore spread
the mortar as the stone sank into place
thej stepped upon it and the men broke
into a loud cheer

  the dam was finished

  jack and larry threw their arms
around each other they had won
thekla and mary came to them tears of
joy in their eyes

  half a mile down the canon a dusty
buggy was coming at a rapid speed a
large uneasy man a bunch of a beard on
his chin was urging tlie horse on with
constant flicks of the whip aaron garth
never spared a horse-or a man if he
had the chance to drive him

  the man beside him sat with com-
pressed lips his hatchet-face was-gray
as though he had slept poorly of late

   what is that noise  he asked 

   they are cheering

  oh 

   it looks as though theyd done us
briggs

  briggs did not answer

   i never knew luck to fail so gid-
dap there we got those farmers all
excited they came down to blow things
up they remained to finish the work

   and those that came to scoff re-
mained to pray muttered briggs

   whats that 

   nothing

 what are you going to do briggs
how do  know briggs sighed
faintly  im not used to being beaten
perhaps they have overlooked some-
thing

   guess we cant depend on that
briggs giddap there  we might have
something smashed before saturday

   it wouldnt do us any good if the
work is already completed

   i hope you dont think we havent
been doing what we could at our end ol
the line

   i think you were up against some
better men garth oh there might be
ways of beating them yet i could trick
them on their bond issue perhaps but
i dont believe its worth while

   whats that

  never mind the last time i was
here i lost something that i had carried
with me for years

  valuable giddap there

  not intrinsically but- he be-
came silent

  garth jerked the foaming horse to a
stand at the gate of the corral but mad-
den had gone up to the dam and garth
had to hitch the animal himself then
the two men went slowly on afoot they
could see the workmen standing in groups
 the broad top of the great gray wall

   who are the two women do you
suppose asked briggs

   larry smiths wife for one the
other t cant guess some friend of
hers i suppose smith and marly are
with em

  as the newcomers got to the top of
the dam jack caught sight of them he
seized larrys elbow and wheeled him
around great heavens he ex-
claimed  look 

  larry started  wist mustnt see
him he whispered as he and jack
moved forward
tjhe dam-builders



   how do you dor mr smith-and
mr marly  briggs was cold and pre-
cise as ever  i see that you have fin-
ished the dam

   yes replied larry coldly

   i-i congratulate you said briggs
 you have done a big thing  shall be
glad to have you go in with me on my
utah enterprise

  larry did not reply the significance
of his silence however was not lost

  a faint ironic smile appeared on the
capitalists face and he said

   may i ask how you managed to
convert the lions into lambs how you
induced the men who came to destroy
your work to remain and finish it

   when you were here before mr
briggs said jack you lost some-
thing

  yes said briggs wondering

   a piece of a shilling mr briggs
   yes did you find it

   a lucky piece of a lucky shilling 

   yes i have missed it

   well mr briggs see if this ex-
plains anything to you  the leader of
the lions who came to destroy our work
is the man who for thirty-five years has
carried the other half of that shilling
 peter   gasped briggs

   yes peter wist said jack sternly
 and if you value your life you will not
let him see you

  where is he asked briggs

   he is back there with his daughter
swiftly briggs darted away straight
toward his enemy larry and jack fol-
lowed on the run they expected noth-
ing short of murder briggs hurried to
the place where wist was standing
peter he called

  the norwegian turned like a flash
he towered above briggs and the em-
bers of old rage blazed in his face

   i have searched for you for years
peter said briggs  that night when
i had you put out of my house-i wish
you had come back

  what do you mean wists voice
was only a strangled whisper

   i mean that then when you had
gone i realized for the first time that
things would never be right with me
until  had made things right with you
 you are my enemy exclaimed wist
shaking free as thekla grasped his arm

   no peter i am my own there
was no question of briggss earnestness
pi is hands were shaking his voice was
uncertain  believe me or not you are
the one man i ever cared for when i
wronged you ithurt me worse than it
ever hurt you but not until you had
been put out of my house that night
did i begin to understand

    not until then and i set aside the
money i had taken from you it has
been growing all these years at compound
interest it is yours peter i have done
many things that were not worth while
but they all trace back to the wrong i
did to you

   peter wist studied the face of his old
partner long he gazed

    i guess it is so he said at last  i
have been happier than you tom-and i
will be happier now if-if i forgive
you

   future biographers of thomas briggs
the money-captain may not record it
but when he heard those words from the
lips of peter wist his eyes became wet

  that evening while the afterglow
still tinged the sky a formal precise
capitalist sat in long converse with a
norwegian farmer and at the doer of
their shack larry and marv well con-
tent gazed musingly down at the sturdy
wall of masonry which stood for more
victories than one

   see jack and thekla down there
walking arm in arm laughed larry
what children they are

  dear she whispered are we not
ourselves children of that kind

  and larrys answer was to draw her
closer to him

the
letters of an oh railroad
man and his son

by herman da costa

no -how to keep gratitude and push
on the rails

jim gets a chance to shine and has a good time proving that he
gan while dad gives an illustration of proper
enthusiasm

the top to the bottom but by some good
luck i managed to read them all then
i would buckle down to the typewriter
and try to hit the keys that i want-
ed to hit while he was doing something
else

   its great having a private car of your
own t f had a brass bed in his state-
room and  had a big room all to my-
self-that is when he wasnt calling me
out of it nobody around to bother us 
once in a while t f would talk about
places he had been and tell stories about
the road

   ive been out with him a-couple of times
since then and am beginning to get used
to it connolly told me that t f said
i was a pretty good stenographer

   i dont wonder people like him dad
pies a man all the way through true
he cusses a great deal but he doesnt mean
cussing for anything bad  its just his way
of expressing his feelings

   people would come out  the line
wherever we went to shake hands with
him everybody called him tom brake-
men engineers firemen section - men-
everybody knew him thered always be
a crowd at almost every station waiting
shorthand while the car was rocking and to see his car come in
lurching about	when bigby came back to work again

my notes straggled over the page from i was honestly sorry to leave t f and

scries began in december  railroad mant maeaiine single copies  ccati



jim to the old man

         ear dad  since i wrote you
            last there has been lots do-
            ing bigby t fs secre-
            tary was taken ill some
            time ago and had to go
            home he developed a case
            of typhoid-fever and was laid up for over
            two months

  in the meantime t f had to go out
on the line and you can imagine how
surprised i was when connolly told me
i was to go out with him pleased if
f had had a couple of feathers in my
bonnet i believe i would have floated
away

  we went out for three days the first
time and say dad you talk about
work when i wasnt busy working i
was busy hunting up some work to do
when i wasnt busy hunting for work
it was because i was too busy working

  t f would give me dictation at the
rate of a mile a minute while we were
on the road its hard enough having to
write at a desk in an office at that speed
and it was kind of piling on the agony
having to write thirty to fifty letters in
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

theres a surprise coming for you dad
theyve raised my salary you know i
started in on sixty-five dollars well
when bigby came back they put my sal-
ary to seventy dollars

  i commenced to thank connolly for it
but lie told me to shut up i wasnt get-
ting paid for anything more than i had
done and the road had done it not he

  thats what i like about connolly he
looks at things differently from most peo-
ple some other man would have talked
about me working harder now that he had
shown his confidence in me and try to
show him by my work that  deserved
the raise and a whole lot of stuff like

was coming to me in order to pacify me
all this because some chief clerk had
talked as if he had done the whole thing

  you hear so much stuff like that here
dad up in the car service department
particularly

  there is a fellow up there named max-
well lie worked for about ten years it
a salary of about seventy-five dollars a
month one day lie got a raise of five
dollars he almost fainted

  after he could think without his head
going around lie went up to claire his
chief clerk and commenced to thank him
for it getting wilder each minute until
he almost flopped on his knees when

maxwell grinned ive found out im a man at last

go back to the office even though it was
hard work out on the line it somehow-
felt different although really it wasnt
but when you are alone with the general
manager you think he sees you can do
good work and you try hard to do bet-
ter work than you usually do so lie will
notice it

  ive settled down again now but

that-trying to make me feel it was due
to him that i had been raised-and i
would have gone away feeling that he
was lying and that i got it because i de-
served it

  then after a while  would begin to
think that the reason i got a raise was
because they wanted me to stay with the
road and that they gave me part of what


the railroad mans magazine

he got through claire commenced to talk
to him about how he had recognized his
ability by giving him the raise and that
he hoped he would repay his confidence
in him by doing much better work than
he had done

  he talked to maxwell for about fifteen
minutes in that strain until maxwell be-
gan to feel angry because claire took all
the credit to himself when he got
through maxwell turned on him

   mr claire he said  god has been
mighty good to me in putting a man like
you in this office i used to think we had
a superintendent of car service here but
now i see that i was mistaken

  what do you mean asked claire
feeling proud at the compliment

   i mean this said maxwell  i
made an ass of myself slopping over to
you that way i thought ou would see
it was merely the surplus gratitude run-
ning over and that it was intended for
the road not yourself

  claire was at first astonished and then
he began to get angry

   you are confounded impudent young
man he yelled  i guess you dont
need that money anyhow come tothink
of it youd better write out your resigna-
tion and ill accept it

  maxwell grinned  ics worth it
claire ive found out im a man at
last

  when connolly told t f about it
t fs eyes twinkled i was banging
away on the typewriter and they didnt
know i heard what they said

   good for the boy said t f hell
make his mark now

   will you take him back   asked
connolly

   certainly not in the first place
thats up to the auditor if i did it would
make bad feeling

  connolly nodded  i know lots of
men in that department are like that but
they cant speak up as maxwell did be-
cause they have families to support

   we only live this life once said
t f  some of us try to make the best
of it but others try to change it to suit
themselves no man need put himself
in that position if he looks at life through
the right kind of glasses

  i have been saving up a little since i
came here got one hundred and twenty

dollars in bank now going some isnt
it and yet when i see so many young
fellows right in the b and d who are
holding down big jobs because theyve
got pull somehow it doesnt seem fair
to me

  when one of these fellows born with
a golden spoon in his mouth comes along
and takes precedence over everybody ill
the neighborhood theres a feeling that
the other fellows arent treated right and
somehow they arent as enthusiastic as
they might be with their work and are
apt to find fault with the road they are
working for

  its only human nature

              affectionately j im

the old man to jim

tear jim  you dont remember john
right of course he was way be-
fore your time johns father was a farm-
er who brought up his son farming john
never did like it so one day he ran away
from home

  i didnt see him again for five years
when he turned up again in pretty bad
shape he had tried almost everything
but was too honest with himself to stick
at it he told me he was going to search
until lie found the kind of work he want-
ed to do

  i laughed at john then for i figured
if a man had a job it was better to hold
 to it and make up his mind he want-
ed it than to give it up and try for some-
thing he didnt know anything about

  well anyway john drifted off again
i the meantime i had gone with the
b and d and was in charge of the
roundhouse at cumberland one day i
was up in chicago  a vacation when
i plumped into john on the street he
was looking pretty prosperous and after
we had talked a while i asked him what
he was doing

  he said that he had at last got some-
thing to do that he liked he was a re-
porter on a newspaper hed been with
the paper for two months but the way he
talked about the newspaper business made
me feel as if i ought to take off my hat
whenever i bought one

  he had me believing before he got
through that it was the holiest kind of an -
enterprise that had ever been set up in
letters of an ole railroad man and his son 

the public market-place and was the voice
of alfree people speaking out when every-
thing else on earth was deaf dumb and
blind and just about ten minutes before
i met john i was cussing them for being
the yellowest meanest bunch of liars that
ever hit the pike

  well anyway  was mighty glad to
hear that john had landed at last and 
got him to take me up to his
office it was a big room with
a row of desks around the wall
and typewriters scattered
about

  there was a bunch of young
fellows in it smoking and wri-
ting and john made me sit
down in a corner of the room
with him and talk over old
times while we was sitting
there somebody in another of-
fice hollered something and
john jumped up and rushed
away in a minute he came
back

   ive got an assignment

billy he says  come along
with me and see how a re-
porter gets a story

   had a little time on my
hands and thought i might
as well use it up that way as
any i hadnt yet got over my
surprise to see john doing that
kind of work

  well at any rate we mo-
seyed around and john talked
to several people about some-
thing or other and they sent
him to other people who
talked about it another way
and finally i went back to the office and
he pecked away at a typewriter for a little
while and turned in his story

  we were sitting chatting in a corner
of the room when a man came out of an
inner office he had a piece of paper in
his hand

  wheres right he bawled then
he saw him  look here right he
said  what do you call this

  john got red but stood up  whats
the matter mr martin he asked

  matter yelled martin whats
this stuff you wrote here do you call
that a news story he shook the piece
of paper in his hand at john

   i dont see anything wrong with this
mr martin said john

   of course you dont  yelled mar-
tin what you ought to do is to go
back to the farm instead of working for
a newspaper

  well sir that would have made any
man mad  know i clenched my fist my-
self and wondered whether it wouldnt

what you ought to do is
to co back to the farm

be a good idea to give him a punch for
luck john walked to the door and flung
back his head

   ill tell you this much martin he
said  ill be managing editor of this
newspaper when you will have to go to
work on a farm yourself to make a liv-
ing

  that was piling it on strong wasnt it
chicago was a mighty big place and
john was a mighty small ant in it but
john had enthusiasm fie loved his
work he wasnt in it for money as much
as for the liking he had for it

  he stayed with that paper until the
week was out then he went with another


the railroad mans magazine

newspaper he worked with them for
about two years and finally began to turn
in work that was the real thing

  then a reorganization of the paper
came and john was made city editor
he held that job about four years and
went on another paper in a higher posi-
tion stayed with them for a while and
finally darned if he didnt get the offer
of managing editor of his first paper

  in the meanwhile martin had gone on
another paper and also had been made
managing editor of that but just about
the time john got his big job martins
paper changed hands tod martin was
thrown out of work

 i was in chicago again then and
dropped in johns office at the time it
happened john had dictated this letter
to martin when i came in

   my dear martin-fifteen years ago
  you told me that i ought to go back to
  work on the farm instead of working
  for a newspaper i now beg to inform
  you that i am owner of a farm in
  southern illinois-which is in good shape
  and well kept

    as you are no doubt looking for work

  i offer you the position of superintend-
  ent of it you should be able to make
  a fairly good living from it if you are
  competent enough please let me hear
  from you promptly sincerely john
  right managing editor

  i didnt see john until about a year
after then he told me that martin had
got furious when he received the letter
and had sat down and wrote a note to
the owner of johns paper who was a
personal friend of his enclosing the let-
ter and requesting that john be fired
the proprietor of the paper simply re-
ferred the note to john and it ended
there

  the beauty of this is that its true
and the particular point i want to bring
out is tliat enthusiasm got john the posi-
tion of managing editor true he had
to have something besides enthusiasm
he had to know the business but he
would never have known it if he hadnt
had the enthusiasm

  there were probably three thousand
other young reporters like him in that
city some with influence some without
but the majority of them with a better
education than he had it was simply a

case of a man finding the work he liked
best and making good in it

  to-day john right is managing editor
of one of the cleanest newspapers in the
country in a city not two hundred miles
from chicago known from one end of
the country to the other and one of the
most popular men in his city

  you say that thats not railroad work
all right then ill tell you about an-
other john this john was named dick-
erson pat niff in your office knows
him well for pat was holding down the
wire at martinsburg when dickerson was
superintendent of the i and f central
division

  in those days the b and d was being
managed by a bunch of men who knew as
much about railroading as a cat knows
about singing they had rolling-stock
out on the line standing on sidings
months at a time

  engines were tied up on branch lines
freight-cars were getting lost and wan-
dering away and altogether the old b
and d was in about as bad a position as
any road could be and not go in the re-
ceivers hands finally it got so bad it
did go in the receivers hands

  the man who managed it then was
named murray his initials are o g
as soon as he was appointed receiver he
sent a tel gram to john dickerson of the
i and f to report for duty at baltimore

  dickerson had a mighty good job at
the time for he was one of the best all-
round men  the country he declined
to come that must have got the old
mans dander up for he sat down and
wrote this to john dickerson

  me john dickerson

    i wired you the position of general
  manager of the b  d ten days ago
  and you have declined it i now offer
  you the position at double the salary
  previously offered payable in advance
  do you want it answer qufek-

  o g m

  now john dickerson was a pretty
shrewd man he had been watching the
b and d for a long while and saw that
the real fault with the road was that the
higher officials had tried to meddle too
much in the actual running of it and
there had been a good deal of  favorite
sons  placed in fat jobs without regard
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

he left john dickerson to run it and john ran it

to their ability to run it so back came
this wire to the old man

    if you will place me in entire control
  of the road with authority to discharge
  and appoint whom i may see fit without
  any one being given power to cancel my
  orders i will accept

  it took o g m about three minutes
to answer that and all he said was
 come well john came

  the first thing he did he fired the
general superintendent of the eastern
division the general superintendent of the
middle division four superintendents six
trainmasters two yardmasters and about
fifteen other officials

  but there was a man in the receivers
chair he just kept on going after
money to finance the road and left john
dickerson to run it and john ran it
he sent to pittsburgh and got two of his
old men there got three more from the
pennsy and gathered about two more in
the rest of the positions he had open
he filled by promotion

  and then the rolling-stock began in

move john was up and down the line
night and day he left a trail of enthu-
siasm behind him wherever he went en-
gines began to move passengers began
to come freight began to pour into the
terminals john was everywhere and his
men worked with him like all get-out

  the old man up in new york fight-
ing hard to get money to keep the road
alive began to find things getting easier
from being known as the worst road in
the country the b and d began to be
known as  not so bad after all it
was hard to live down the reputation that
had been put on her-in fact to this day
its a joke in pittsburgh that if you want
to leave there the worst way you must
take the b and d-but she fought up
and pretty soon began to show her head
once more and perk up

  john fairly made things hum if a
man worked hard good he was right
in line for promotion and got it too
if he wasnt able to work hard out with
him

  john dickerson put life into the old
road when it was fairly at us last gasp


the railroad mans magazine

  he did what any other railroad man
in the country would have declared im-
possible he did it because he was en-
thusiastic he knew the b and d was
the natural outlet for one of the best sec-
tions of coal and grain country in the
united states the rails were there and
the rolling-stock was there

  well sir the annual directors meet-
ing came around it was just a year that
john had been with the road and in that
time he had set it on its feet again true
it was still a trifle unsteady but before
he came it was ready to have prayers said

  so the board of directors in solemn
conclave assembled decided that john
dickerson should be written a letter com-
mending him for his excellent manage-
ment they composed a letter that read
like the declaration of independence
each man signed it and it was mailed

  john was out on the line as usual
when his mail came in they brought
him the big letter with its red seal and

little railroads

officered like a south american rev-
olutionary army is the southeastern
railway company operating the short-
est railroad in the state of washington
in its statement for the year ending june 
 just filed with the state railway com-
mission it reports six general officers one
general clerk one station agent one engi-
neer one fireman one conductor three
trackmen and a section foreman the line
is four and three-tenths miles in length and
runs from kanglev to camp five junction

  the report states that the clerk drew a
salary of  cents a day as against  a
day for the trackmen and  for the con-
ductor the engineer worked forty-one
days during the year and the fireman put
in nineteen days while the general officers
worked  days one general officer drew
salary at the rate of  a day

  under the heading calling for a report of
 important changes during the year the
report says  mileage decreased nine-tenths
of a mile by abandonment of line from
camp five switch to end of track

  the total cost of the railway and equip-
ment to june  last is reported at 
which includes  for right of way and
 for stationery and printing

  the road carried  tons of freight and

john tore it open fid read it over care-
fully laid it down on the table picked
up a big blue pencil and scrawled over
the letter in big characters then put it
in another envelope and mailed it back
to the dignified board of directors

  the secretary of the board received it
and opened it in the presence of the other
directors john had this scrawled over it

   we are knocking merry hades out of
  them	john dickerson

  only it wasnt hades should you
ever go in the presidents office look over
the old mans desk that letter is hang-
ing over it in a frame and straggling
across the embellished words in blue

  look at it jim its right to the point
it showed what a man did with his en-
thusiasm properly directed

ture dont let your dignities make you

barbed-wire chivalry

       by katharine eggleston

    proving that woman can win in a scrimmage

    even if theres no bargain-counter in sight

om press your gills you
  sardine dont you take
  any liberties in breathing
  unless you can do it up-arid-
  downward  bill bellows
  hunched over against frank
  storrs as he spoke

   aw whats hurting you how much
of this train-licl have you bought
storrs asked gruffly

   were a crowdin the lady bellows
whispered as lie snuggled closer to frank

  instantly storrs gave up the room he
had been contesting and cultivated a dan-
gerous intimacy with the edge of the box-
car roof then stretched his neck to see
across the back of his very near neighbor

   the lady  was lying flat on her
stomach just as the men were her feet
toward the middle of the car and her

head raised as she looked out across the
brown and red of the prairie

  she was the only woman who had
dared to mount to the car-top when the
inside of that and all the other cars re-
fused to hold another person a look of
admiration passed between the two men
it was a tribute to her nerve

  the train bumped along the newlv
made track which had been laid to ac-
commodate the home-seekers who were
making the run to secure possession of
the claims in the territory the government
was opening up for settlement for a
month wagons and horses carts and
burros had been coming to the border
of the new country and stopping there to
await the signal for the scramble for-
claims

  but the woman on the top of the car




the railroad mans magazine

me

  yet here she was and the two men
who made room for her liked her all the
better for looking like that and having
the courage to shin up the side of a box
car and take chances

  youre makin the run bellows
  asked by way of opening up
  conversation

   im letting the railroad
  do it for me she answered as
  she stretched a little to absorb
  the extra space the men had
  given her

   they aint goin to do
  moren a half-way job you
  know storrs volunteered

    yes youll have to finish
on your own-uni bellows
swallowed the word he had in-
tended to say with the exaggerated
punctiliousness of the frontiersman
when he talks to a woman he thinks is
 real  one

 i wish they were wheels id stand
a better show the girl said smiling
a little at the embarrassment of the big
man beside her

 itll be a grand scrimmage when
the train stops and we all light out for
sure  storrs observed not wanting
the sociability to come to an end-
which way you goin bellows
asked after he had rescued himself
from the depths into which his awk-
wardness of speech had precipitated
him

 i havent decided the girl said
with such brevity that storrs thought
she was offended

silence fell if it can be called si-
lence when a heavily laden train is
pounding along protestingly

finally storrs found his

    i dont want to be cuttin
 appearin to try to boss but
 this here land an if you wuz to ask

courage

in and
i know

   the girl turned her head so that she
 faced him with sucli a sudden eager
 movement that storrs stopped in sur-
 prise

    well i do ask you   ask you to
 tell me what to do im anxious-
 and both of the men turned their eyes
 away and looked along the rolling
 horizon line as tears gathered and her

 hang on

yelled

was an unexpected development even in
this time and place of the unexpected
she was pretty too with sweet lips and
calm soft eyes the kind of girl who
would have looked in place sitting on a
veranda embroidering a doily
barb ed- wi re chivalry

lips trembled and stiffened as she tried to
control them

   im so anxious to get a good claim
we havent any home and ive paid
almost every cent we have to register and
if-if-if  should be crowded out or
not -get a claim or-or anything id-

   well you wont be crowded out or
not get anything you jes run our way
well start you right said storrs

  he and bellows had hunted through
the indian territory and the panhandle
had traded with the indians and ridden
in the round-ups till the country was an
open book to them they knew just the
claims they meant to stake

  they would lose no time but go
straight as the crow flies to the land they
had decided to get and settle on a
home loomed large in the minds of both
they had knocked about till the edges
that they had bumped into began to make
them a bit sore and cause them to long
for quiet and certainty

  both felt for the little woman beside
them she was out after the same good
thing just a little woman quiet and
sweet and weak making the run that
would probably test even their strength
and endurance each of them registered
a vow to help her win

  with a great grumbling of wheels and
a shrilling whistle that was like a com-
mand to get off the train began to slow
down

  moved by the impulse to get a good
start the whole sardine-like arrangement
of men swung about till their feet shuf-
fled and felt about the edge of the car
roof over which their eager faces had
stretched a moment before

  the little woman was turned about
with the mass of humanity lighter than
the others and less muscular she could
not keep herself safely poised on the flat
roof before bellows could get himself
adjusted and look to her she was pushed
over and grabbing frantically at any-
thing that promised to arrest her fall she
seized his big-booted foot

  hang on he yelled realizing the
predicament after the first jerk as her
weight nearly dragged him from the car

  he followed his own instructions as -v
he slid off he seized storrss legs

  storrs surprised by the maneuver
hurled an indignant protest at his captor

     r r

  turn me loose you coyote

  but the coyote was dangling uncer-
tainly in space hitched firmly at one end
by the desperate clasp of the nervy little
lady and anchored with a finality that
left storrs no choice to the pair of boots
above him-

  storrs felt himself going or the edge
seizing a pair of legs that offered a last
chance he too swung down from the
car-top feeling the outraged kicks of his
victim subside as he got busy with the
top end of himself and sought the same
leg route to safety

  down from the car - top the human
chain depended the men crowded on
the iron ladder at the end of the car
yelled and cheered the little lady
looked down she swung a short dis-
tance only from the ground bellows
felt the weight on his legs removed she
landed lightly and safely on the soft dirt
along the track side

  the train was stopping bellows let
go the little woman saw a dozen eager
legs adjusting themselves to spring to the
ground and set off in the race

  which way shall i run she cried
shaking bellowss arm in her excitement

   that way he pointed  run like
the-the dickens 

  her soft eyes looking up into his with
perfect trust made him gulp again at his
linguistic extravagance

   howll i know when- she began

   ill yell git  he commanded

  the loyalty that had made him cling
to storrs and storrs tohim through
greaser fights and empty cupboard days
caused him to wait till the dragging chain
of men had brought his friend to safe
dropping distance

  as soon as a point was- reached where
storrs could cut loose from his hold on
the upper mans legs without running the
risk of breaking his own bellows sang
out

   leggo you indian youre on
terry f enny 

  he ran ahead to where storrs landed
together the two swung about and
paused for an instant to get their bear-
ings poised on the top of a ridge of
dirt thrown up along the railroad track
was the little lady she waved her hand
to them

  they plunged forward toward the


he railroad mans magazine

ridge she shot down the other side
when they reached the top and had a
chance to look beyond she was scudding
over the prairie like a big brown rabbit

  jumping jehu look at her go
bellows cried in a burst of admiration

    follow the leader  storrs yelled as
he stretched his long legs and set off

  the train had come to a dead stand-
still the mob had poured out of the
doors to fall under and over the drop-
ping load from the tops of the cars
screams of fright of anger of derision
made the prairie that had never known
more than the shouts of the cowboys and
the bark of the coyotes a pandemonium
of human noises

   bellows glancing back saw the ridge
of earth change to a pyramid of people
the race was on out the crowd
streamed covering the brown plain with
a motley lot of plunging puffing swear-
ing sweating creatures who made the
prairie-dogs scud into their holes and lay
low

   the flying feet ripped the brown skin
of grass from the red soil till it looked
as if the whole land bled under the lac-
erating heels

  out ahead skimming as lightly along
as if she had borrowed wings from the
sweeping wind ran the little lady on
she went till her brown figure became
a sort of focus for the eyes that stared
toward the promised land

  bellows and storrs pelted along in
something like proximity but she flitted
before them at a distance and so the di-
recting yell that was to tell her where to
stop was lost in the racket and roll of
the voices behind

  suddenly a barrier appeared to leap
out of the ground some far-seeing cat-
tleman had set up a barbed-wire fence
that seemed to her eyes to stretch from
chaos on one side into eternity on the
other

  she glanced over her shoulder the
pounding mob was coming fleetness of
foot was her only advantage she would
lose the benefit of that if she stopped to
find an opening through the fence and
the lowest wire was too close to the
ground for her to roll under

  gathering her short skirt as tightly
about her as she could she dashed at the
fence

    good guns shes going to climb it 
bellows cried with a sickening memory
of the torn sides of horses the bleeding
flanks of cows that had come in contact
with the wire octopus

   already she was putting her foot on
the lowest wire she had climbed up the
freight-car this looked comparatively
easy as her modesty could not make her
shrink for the feat when the crowd was
so far behind

   she felt the cold prick of a barb in
her hand and sought a more satisfactory
hold she had managed to get to the top
of the six - wire fence shaking and
swinging on her uncertain footing and
obliged to disregard the prongs that were
gouging into her hands and body as she
pulled herself up she reached a place
where jumping was her only resource

   lbiable to take any notice of her skirts
with her hands and feet so fully occupied
she lifted herself to spring the fourth
wire on which she stood vibrated cra-
zily the fifth wire bit and dug at her
knees and the top wire by which she
tried to steady herself before jumping
wabbled up and down under the uncer-
tain pressure of her hands

   just as she prepared to spring a shout
from the rear assailed her ears it had
the effect of sending her forward desper-
ately she scrambled frantically to re-
gain her balance the effort entirely
killed the little momentum she had she
turned a half hand-spring and landed in
a heaped-up tangle of skirts and loosened
hair on all the barbs in her immediate
neighborhood 

   madly she tried to drag herself loose
she dropped her whole weight hoping to
tear herself down from the wires blood
streamed from her torn hands and by
the merest chance she kept her face from
being scratched by the trembling top
wire

   one who has never had an experience
with a barbed - wire fence can scarcely
picture the tenacity of the hold with which
the wire demon clutched her

   the big hope that had buoyed her in
overcoming difficulties died as she hung
there the horde behind would sweep
by her all the land would be grabbed
she would be left a bit of driftwood on
the sea of the prairie that every one but
herself would have some claim upon
barbed-wire chivalry



  the thought of the two men to whose
kindness she had owed her comfort on
the car roof and especially of the one
whose good left leg had saved her from
a bad fall came to her now if only
they would come to pick her off this ter-
rible trap

  the two men were coming running
with renewed vigor as they saw her ar-
rested a captive of the barbed-wire fence

  then the little lady began to wonder if
they would extricate her they too were
running for a home they had entered
the race to win they were quite justi-
fied in looking on her as an obstacle in
their way removed-or rather held up
by fate for their benefit

  would they loosen her from the tor-
turing fence and if they did what
show would she stand when the great
croavd swept down upon her tears of
discouragement ran down her cheeks

  bellows was wasting his breath swear-
ing with every step he took

   its that white-livered half-breeds
done this thinks liell turn the pack off
the scent of the good land beyond so he
can wiggle his dirty carcass onto it  he
growled

   shut up your steam-box and run 
storrs ordered showing the worth of his
advice by leaping ahead of his comrade

  he dashed on toward the fence an-
other minute and he was working with
might and main to free the dress the
hair the flying ends that seemed to have
grown all over her

  you-you mustnt let me loose
she sobbed hysterically i-i might get
the very land you want i might take
your claim

   guess theys enough to go round-
the whole passels got to he added as
lie saw the mob sweeping down toward
the fence

  bellows came up to the other side just
as storrs gave up trying to work through
the wires and climbed over between
them they pulled and tore the little lady
free

  storrss bleeding hands bore testimony
to his efforts  but the little lady lifted
her soft eyes-the tears making them
softer still-to bellowss face and thanked
him

   i aint done nothin he disclaimed
with a gratified flush showing through
his bronzed skin

the race was on  out the crowd streamed covering the brown plain


the railroad mans magazine

  the rage of the crowd rose in a roar
as they came on the formidable fence
a few of the hardier ones tried to climb
but most of the land-seekers knew barbed-
wire fences and respected them the
race swung about as the crowd scurried
like a huge herd of giant jack-rabbits
along the wires seeking an opening

   look at em scared cats weve
got it our own way  bellows gloated

  and they had only a meager few
had managed to get up and over the
fence with much satisfaction to them-
selves  and now they were running out
toward the land that was obviously richer
and better

   go it  bellows shouted to the girl
as the advance runners came closer
 go it good well give you a handi-
cap-er-wont we bill

  storrs nodded

   oh no  couldnt let you youve
been so good its not fair  the little
lady objected standing on ceremony in
tl tattered remnants of what had been
a very neat and serviceable brown dress

   light out dont be a-lady  bel-
lows shouted his eyes on the foremost of
the claim-seekers

  storrs shuddered at the temerity of his
friend he spoke as if the little lady
were just an ordinary woman and to
his relief the little lady seemed rather
pleased than otherwise

  off she shot as if bellowss command
had been a key to set the mechanism of
her body in motion

   hurrah  leg it leg it  bellows
yelled with forgetful but genuine en-
thusiasm

   shut up you eejut  storrs warned

   at the instant a long-legged air-split-
ting figure shot by them the head of the
fence-climbers

   hike  bellows shouted to storrs

  the race now had narrowed down to
themselves and the sandpiper whose
marvelous strides measured off space with
clockwork regularity bellows hated the
man and his red goatee before he had
run a half dozen yards abreast of him

  the pine pegs that marked the corners
of the quarter sections showed now and
then a bit more freshly yellow than the
drying grass

  bellows was wrathy at the man who
ran him just a little better making with

each stride a slightly perceptible advance
storrs looked ahead at the little lady

  she had come to a place where a
fringe of stunted willows and a few
mesquit trees indicated the bed of a dry
creek

   stop  hold up   storrs sang out
making a megaphone with his bony
hands

   on she flew quite too intent to realize
that she had reached a good place

   hi  bellows shouted

  the red-bearded man diverted his thin
body for an instant from its straight line
of procedure and planted a jab with his
sharp elbow in the neighborhood of bel-
lowss fifth rib

   mind your business  he said

   you- bellows snorted as he
squared off to return the compliment to
advantage

   aw cut it  said the red-bearded
runner as he made prompt use of the
slight advantage bellowss pause gave
him and struck out at a quicker pace

  bellows was too mad to think of a
claim he set off after the man with a
purpose that gave wings to his feet but
the kangaroo-creature had incentive too
the kind he carried always in large quan-
tities-self-interest his eyes were fixed
on the small brown figure that had
stopped at bellowss call just as quickly
as it had set off at his command

  his shrewd sense that smelled out
everything to his own interest told him
that there was a good reason for bel-
lowss warning cry he glanced about
at the prairie and saw the greener grass
the fresher foliage that indicated the
presence of water at a more recent period
than most of the land he had run over
had enjoyed his running mate evident-
ly knew the lay of the land and was
giving the little woman the benefit of
his knowledge

  gathering himself together for a su-
preme effort the man hurtled forward
with a speed that dropped bellows be-
hind after two leaps

  bellows losing ground and storrs
still further behind saw him come up to
tne little lady they could see that he
was waving a dictatorial forefinger and
that she was shaking her head decidedly

  then from the angry motions and the
wildly waving red goatee they could
barbed-wire chivalry-



tell that the red-bearded man was saying
a good deal bellows imagined that he
saw the nervy little woman shrink he
veiled to storrs

   chase 

  both men dragged the fresh air into
their lungs and rushed forward at top
speed

  the little lady turned to them eagerly
they stopped panting beside her

  the woman sent a glance that would
have shriveled any but the atrophied
pride of the man she faced

   im not your wife ezra innes she
asserted

   you aint got your decree mirandy
th man gloated  i guess these here
gentlemen aint so perlite that theyll try
to run yer husband off his wifes land

 oh you-you- the wrath of

 hes trying to make me give up

  whats up bellows demanded

   hes trying to make me give up she
answered the tears coming

   you skunk  bellows cried facing
the tyrant  this here lands hern we
seen her on it before youd come within
bearin didnt we storrs h

   you bet  storrs seconded

   youd better make tracks bellows
advised

  the red goatee quivered as the owner
of it laughed

   you two air some kind this here
is my wife an i guess i kin stand to let
her git this claim-if you insist

  if storrs lfad not been too busy with
his own amazement he would have de-
scribed bellows as completely flabber-
gasted staring from the man to the
little lady bellows was speechless

the little lady ended in a burst of tears

  she flung herself down on the ground
and gave way to a spasm of grief and
anger that reduced the two astounded
frontiersmen to even more complete si-
lence

  bellows looked down at her with anger
and pity struggling in his face storrs
clenched and unclenched his hands both
felt utterly helpless in the face of the
situation

   its always been like this the little
lady finally found voice to say  he
always comes along and takes everything
away from me he done it ever since i
married him and lies going to keep
on doing it

  bellows and storrs looked at mr innes
to see how this accusation affected him
but it slipped from his leather-like hide


the railroad mans magazine

this is my sister s decree  you can-git

as lightly as the wind capered across the
plains

   ef you two want to git the kind
uv land that suits you you better run
erlong he suggested comfortably

  bellows and storrs looked at each
other then at the approaching runners
and last at the little lady

  she looked pitifully up at them her
face stained by her tears and the red
earth she lifted her shbulders and
made a gesture with her little bloody
hands that seemed to say she recognized
the uselessness of protest

   go on  get your claims dont
let them cheat you out of yours too she
urged

  bellows and storrs turned away there
seemed to be nothing for them to do but
look to their own interest which they did
by making quick progress across the creek-
bed to land that they knew to be first-
class

  within an hour the prairie was peo-
pled five and six claimants on each
quarter-section laid the foundation for a
legal war that went merrily on while
others bought off and  swopped  to
save themselves lawyers fees

  water sold for a dollar a glass and

mr innes again scenting his own ad-
vantage went into the business and
reaped a rich harvest from the puddle
that nestled on his side of the creek-bed

  during the second day of their occu-
pancy bellows and storrs neither of
them daring to leave the land they had
taken were carrying on a long-range
conversation when a rattling old sulky
and horse came along

  a young man whose cheeks burned
with a suspicious redness drove the queer
turnout the presence of canned goods
was evident by the gunny-sack that dan-
gled from the back of the seat

  spare any fodder bellows asked
as he drew up

   nope takin it to my sister the
young fellowr responded pleasantly this
is great aint it  

  he filled his cramped lung cavity with
the ozone and lifted eyes exactly like the
little ladys to the big blue sky

  whose your sister storrs asked
quickly as he saw the color and soft
glow of the eyes

   mrs innes that was praise be the
boy replied

  bellows came up to the sulky and laid
his hand on the uncertain wheel
barbed-wire chivalry



   great old trap aint it  best we
could afford she came down  the
train-to get in good you know and
i jogged along with this bunch of bones
they told me back yonder that along
heres where the train-load got to going
im looking for-

  bellows interrupted

   shes over the creek with her hus-
band

  the young fellow shot up from the
rickety seat and stood on the wabbly
foot-rest his face one big interrogation
 what  

  sure her an mr innes got that
claim over yonder

  that monster aint here the boy
asserted and asked at once hes hound-
ed her till shes desperate ill kill him
the second i ight him

  he had ptdled a pistol -from his
pocket and the intensity of his anger
had sent the red flying into his cheeks

  weve raked and gcraped all we
could to get down here-me for my
health and her to get shut of him and
hes here

  the same helpless acceptance of the
ubiquitous mr innes that had seemed to
take possession of the little lady threat-
ened to overwhelm her brother evi-
dently the husband was an octopus when
once his tentacles clutched

   hes there all right  bellows
growled  hes sellin puddle-water fur
a dollar a dipper gettin ready to live on
easy street when they lay out the town-
on his land i reckon hes got the kind
uv luck you cant kill

    yer sister got the claim fust storrs
added  but he come along an took
possession cause she was his wife

  trembling with nervous excitement
the boy was fishing in the opening of his
flannel shirt for something that showed
the outline of sharp corners he pulled
out a thick letter in an official envelope

   i guess he wont browbeat her any-
more thats her decree it came just
after she left

  he stood waving the envelope in one
hand while his other still clutched the
pistol

  bellows snatched the envelope

   whend you say you got it  he de-
manded

   day before yesterday the brother

  answered staring with some displeasure
at the excited man

   then she wasnt his wife when she
got the claim we kin prove she got
there fust its hern-its hern   bel-
lows shouted

  swept by the enthusiasm that took pos-
session of them the three men made quick
time to the innes claim

  storrs and bellows swallowed hard
when they saw the little lady fling her-
self into her brothers arms

   archie archie 

  quickly treading on the very heels of
her joy her grief found expression in
the brief but sufficient  ezras here 

   he aint going to stay the brother
asserted looking over his sisters shoul-
der at mr -innes who came from his
shack

   this is my sisters decree you can
-git  he cried waving the envelope in
the husbands face

   you mean you and her kin git  that
individual answered coolly  this is
my claim

  i reckon not bellows said with
decision  that there decree was grant-
ed before yesterday so you wasnt her
husband an we kin swear that she was
here fust-so this aint your claim 

  mr innes looked at bellows as if he
thought of protesting but that look evi-
dently gave him cause to reconsider he
turned with a fair amount of self-pos-
session and started to go storrs met him

   you can leave the money for that
muddy water you got out of this ladys
crick he said mildly but with his pistol
for emphasis

  and mr innes with a recognition that
he was beaten handed over the money

   its-its all because you picked me
off the barb-wire fence mrs innes said
as she lifted her gentle eyes to bellows

  bellows and storrs swallowed hard but
for different reasons

  but the best part of the stoty is
though its only reality not romance that
the friendship between the two men never
wavered while they both courted the lit-
tle lady and it grew insoluble in the
comfort of their miserable confidences
when the storekeeper from the town in
missouri where she had lived cams down
and married the little lady whose first
sweetheart he had been
running down lost freights

the true story series how would you like to have

t o l f c tacked onto your name puzzle folks wouldnt it
those letters stand for an interesting profession-tracer of lost
freight-cars if you were a tracer there is no telling where you would have
to go on this great northern continent while running down a missing car
mr blakeley had a number of interesting experiences while he was a tracer-
quite as exciting as if he were a detective in search of an elusive robber

     but-thanks to a wonderful system and well-kept records-there are not
so many missing freight-cars as one would imagine and the fact as mr
blakeley says that his calling is followed by less than a dozen persons shows
how well our great railroad companies keep tab on their wandering rolling-
stock	

if it hadnt been for a baseball game and some piutes wandering
in a forgotten land two cars might have
been lost forever

true story number forty-one

or upward of twenty years
i was a tracer of lost
freight-cars it is a unique
calling and is followed by
less than a dozen persons
to those unacquainted with
the intricacies of car-counting it might
seem easy to keep track of the rolling-
stock  but when it is considered that no
matter how small the road owning it a car
may be sent from the atlantic to the pa-
cific and be handled by a dozen different
train-crews and perhaps as many switch-
ing - crews at all hours of the day and
night there is plenty of room for mistakes

  passenger express and  siggage-cars
are rarely lost but the freighi-car depart-
ment is less fortunate and every road of
any importance has its lost-car agent who
is always on the wing hunting up stray
cars

  his trips frequently cover thousands of
miles and take him into all sections of
the country from the busy yards in the
large cities to some out-of-the-way switch
in a desolate region where the railroad
station stands alone

  while i was lost-car agent for the ala-
bama great southern i had some queer
experiences while out on a hunt for box

running down lost freights



car  a telegram reached me at aber-
deen mississippi that as soon as my re-
port was turned in regarding its where-
abouts i was to go to terre haute
indiana in search of gondola 

  this car had been sent to indianapolis
with a load of machinery for the nordyke
marmon machine company from tusca-
loosa alabama and having arrived and
been unloaded instead of being sent home
it had been loaded with car-trucks and
sent to terre haute via vandalia they
being short of cars and it being the un-
written rule to use anything in sight when
a car must be had

  from terre haute it was sent to brazil
for a load of coal it was the plan to
load it there and send it on the way home
as far as indianapolis with block coal on
its arrival at brazil the mineswere closed
owing to a strike and the car was side-
tracked on a c and e i spur owned
jointly by the latter road and the van-
dalia here the car dropped out of exist-
ence no further trace being obtainable

  the books of the agents and switching-
crews showed its arrival but no trace of
its departure on my arrival at brazil
i carefully inspected every side-track and
coal-switch in the town but no sign of
 many other cars of other roads
built at the same shops and of the same
description as the lost car were there but
no a g s 

  i was about to give up the hunt there
and try some other near-by town to see if
it might not have been shoved out there
for want of room at brazil when i
chanced to go down the chicago and
eastern illinois tracks toward the station
north of the roundhouse

  a game of ball in a park had attracted
my attention being a lover of the sport
i found on consulting my watch that i
had nearly an hour till the first train go-
ing over to where the two nines were play-
ing i sat down on a convenient knoll and
was soon oblivious to all but the game
the catcher was the weak point in one
club and many muffs of his allowed the

the usefulness of the back-stop drew
my attention


the railroad mans magazine

tally of the other side to run up nothing
but a back-stop preventing the ball from
landing in a pool of water

  the usefulness of the back-stop which
was both high and heavy drew my atten-
tion to it it looked strangely familiar
and i drew closer and soon recognized it
to be the sideboards of a gondola nailed
to upright posts

  this fact interested me more and go-
ing around to the rear my astonished
vision was greeted with the sight of the
letters  a g s in white but nearly
effaced and on the end of the boards
 

  in a few minutes i learned that the
boards had been purloined by enthusiastic
lovers of baseball from an old demolished
car getting my informant to accompany
me i went to the spot and found that
from the spur track another spur had been
built at one time to a coal-shaft now
abandoned and full of water

  by questioning the track foreman i
found that the old shaft had caved in one
night taking with it several rods of the
switch the hole was filled with water
some twenty feet deep and was perhaps a
hundred feet in diameter

  close inquiry elicited the fact that the
track had been filled with cars though
none had gone down as was thought
when the end sank in the cave-in think-
ing differently i secured a pump from a
near-by mill and connecting it with their
steam plant started the work of empty-
ing the cave-in as such ponds are called

  after three days of steady pumping the
bottom began to show and soon the draw-
bar and timbers of a gondola-car were vis-
ible when the water had been sufficient-
ly lowered it was quickly recognized as
our lost car  though badly broken
up and in a terrible plight from lying in
the mud and water for nearly two years

  a derrick was rigged up the wreck-
ing-car of the chicago and eastern illi-
nois was called into use and the remains
of the gondola were brought to solid
ground again temporary rails soon got
it back on the track the back-stop was
reinstalled in its original position the car
was temporarily repaired and sent home
for overhauling the mystery was solved
and my work was done

  a few months after this i was sent to
st louis to locate car  a g s it

was a box car that had left selma ala-
bama for san francisco loaded with
oakum for ship-calking from san fran-
cisco where it had been unloaded it was
sent over to oakland and from there to
coronado beach california with a con-
signment of furniture

  from there after unloading it had
gone empty to encinitos where a gigan-
tic powder-works is located here it was
loaded with powder and billed to litch-
field illinois the consigners being a coal
company

  it had been despatched via the santa
fe route in connection with the southern
pacific and missouri pacific and it was
traced to east st louis with but little
trouble here it dropped out of exist-
ence while it was being made up in the
big four yards-at least so far as the
official record of it was concerned

  persistent inquiry failed to locate it
and i went to litchfield there the books
of the agent showed that the powder had
been received but in a canada southern
car no  and that the car had been
emptied and despatched to port pluron
michigan as standing orders were to re-
turn to that point all empty cars of that
line

  the name and number being somewhat
similar i concluded to go to port huron
arriving there i found the car had been
sent to shingleton michigan just a few
days before where it was to load with
shingles

  taking the first train there i found a
sawmill and lumber-yard in the midst of
a forest i hastened to the single side-
track and i inspected the cars half a
dozen in number half loaded with shin-
gles i found c s car  as expected

  a close inspection however revealed
that on the trucks and other iron-work
underneath was our companys name as
nearly all companies do mark their cars
it was easy to see that the sides of the car
had been newly made and painted the
ends however were badly scorched and
the original boards had been repainted
the sills of the car were badly smoked
this was evidently our car

  in reply to a telegram it was ascer-
tained that at the time of the great oil
refinery fire in the yards in east st louis
in the previous fall a number of cars were
burned some being totally consumed and
running down lost freights



i struck out to
enough

others damaged our car
had been injured and in
the process of repairing
it had been lettered in-
correctly

  after the usual rou-
tine of correspondence
the car was turned over
to us by the canada
southern people along
with a bill for thirty-
six dollars and eighty
cents which they had
paid for repairs and
the mystery of 
was solved

  perhaps none of the
many spectators and
railroad men knew how
near they had been to
death when that car
loaded with enough
powder to wipe out the
city had been in the
midst of them with the
woodwork on fire

  another interesting
experience in tracing
lost cars fell to me in  while in
an eastern city i received orders to go
at once to gila bend arizona and see if
i could locate box car  of the mis-
sissippi central a leased branch line of
the alabama great southern this car
had been the subject of a great deal of
correspondence before it had even been
traced so far

  it had been in texas and from the
houston and texas central had been
traced to the toledo st louis and kan-
sas city railroad thence to st louis
again and from there it had gone west to
nevada where it had been loaded with
silver ore

  thence it had been back to argentine
kansas to the smelter where it had re-
mained a month before being unloaded 
and then by a yardmasters error had
been billed to yuma arizona in place of
selma alabama

  it had broken down at gila bend ari-
zona cn route and had been set off on an
abandoned spur-track almost overgrown
with cactus and sage-brush the spur at
one time led to a quarry of quartz some
three miles back but had been aban-
doned

see who would be fool
to locate there

  the locality was as desolate as a fier-s
mit could desire not an inhabitant being
within miles and a name was given to it
only because occasionally a stockman
flagged the train south of the bend was
a sand waste-an arid desert

  dropping off the train at this place i
was lonesome in a minute and the only
consolation i could get out of the situation
was that the west-bound train would be
along in three hours and i could get back
into civilization at mineral point a vil-
lage some sixty miles away

  taking the track or spur switch which
left the main line at the bend of the road
i walked along the ties the rails had
been removed except for a few lengths
near the track i wandered along for half
a mile through the cactus watching for
gila monsters rattlesnakes and other
pleasant sojourners whom i might intrude
upon to my sorrow i at last came upon
what appeared to be the end of the grade

  the track disappeared at the edge of a
high sandhill evidently a formation of
some wind-storm for which the desert is
noted why i do not know  but curios-
ity prompted me to climb this hill which
was some thirty or forty feet in height


the railroad mans magazine

and covering an acre or more i was re-
warded only by a stretch of sand-plains
covered here and there with sage-brush

  seeing nothing of interest and anxious
to get away from the lonesome spot i was
about to return when from behind a little
sand-knoll a quarter of a mile away i saw
a curl of smoke arising thoughtless of
possible danger in this haven for outlaws
and renegade indians i struck out to see
who would be fool enough to locate there

  in what had formerly been the old
quartz quarry stood a dilapidated box car
out of which came smoke while half a
dozen piute children and an assortment
of native dogs lolled in the sun no in-
dians being on the war-path i made bold
to venture farther an old squaw was
tanning some kind of hide while an old
buck was stretched out asleep inside a rug
of wolf-hides

  unable to converse in their language
i confined mysglf to a survey of the prem-
ises and while the trucks and running
gear of the car were buried in sand one
side showed plainly that it was what was
left of mississippi central  the
lettering and paint had completely van-
ished from the side exposed to the wind
an explanation from the indians being
unobtainable i left under the scrutiny of
the squaw and the barking dogs

  retracing my steps as well as i could

train held u

little did the passengers of the train
going to kingville realize that a chick-
en hawk was the cause of their train being
delayed for something like two and a half
hours says the rock hill south carolina
herald some time before the train was due
at lesslie station a citizen discovered that
a hawk was after his chickens

  he got his gun but before he could get a
chance to shoot it had escaped with one of
the chickens he followed the bird which
was floating along through the air like an
aeroplane until it discovered one of the big
steel towers of the southern power com-
pany near the railroad

  the hawk had its prey in its claws seeking
some spot where it could enjoy its breakfast
without hesitation it flew straight to the
tower alighting upon one of the wires which
was charged with a voltage of  still

in the shifting sand i was on hand at the
spot where the train stopped when flagged
at yuma i wired headquarters full par-
ticulars about finding  and the im-
possibility of ever getting it back

  orders came at once to burn it and if
possible carry away the trucks and iron
as there was not a team within forty
miles the latter was out of the question
and i wired back to that effect nettled
by this reply the officials sent orders to
burn it anyhow this i did aided by six
stalwart section-men it was only our
show of superior force and our help in
removing the effects of the family that
we succeeded in avoiding a fight as scar-
faced john the buck was ready to defend
his home

 investigation solved the problem as to
how the car got there ft is likely that
after the car was side-tracked some one
released the brake and it ran down the
grade which was sufficiently steep to
carry it near to if not into the quarry
then the ever-shifting sands soon cov-
ered up the track the quarry was aban-
doned and the spur closed

  the country was abandoned to the
roaming piutes sage-hens and the ever-
dreaded gila monsters it became a part
of the forgotten country and little won-
der that even a freight-car should get lost
there

p by a hawk

clinging to the chicken and with the owner
close behind

  but the hawk did not last long for no
sooner had its feet touched the wire when
some part of its body or the bodj of the
chicken touched the steel tower which
caused instant death forming a short cir-
cuit which caused the heavy charged wire
to burn in two

  in falling it landed on the railroad track
at the crossing which is a little way below
lesslie station when the train reached
lesslie station captain mcguire who was
in charge was informed of the danger that
lay ahead and after stopping the train lie
secured preston lesslies auto and came to
rock hill and phoned to the power plant to
cut off the juice in a short while the
train which had been delayed for nearly
three hours went speeding on its way
why bayard stayed

       by robert fulkerson hoffman

          an engineer declares against high heroics
          then calmly breaks the wise rule he makes

ll right have it your way i
  wouldnt make bad friends
  with you about it

  hutton the front brake-
man spoke in tones of
broad compassion for
hopeless ignorance his was the voice of
a regret that yields much because of an
encounter with an adversary that is so very
wrong

   and ill tell you why he added
unexpectedly losing hold of his pacific
intentions in a sudden revulsion of cer-
tainty and renewed aggression

   neither you nor any other man
knows what hed do in that kind of a
squeeze until hes square up against it
and a lot of them dont know then till
its all over and the pieces have quit fall-
ing

  aw what you talking about de-
manded sunny acre the fireman  you
talk as though a man had no more sense
than a rabbit nor as much for a rabbit
knows enough to hop before hes grabbed
both back and front dont he

   now thats just where your flags
faded declared hutton  hes just as
likely to set still till lies grabbed as he
is to hop off and if you was a little
older at the business youd know it

   what business laughed acre from
under the vizor of his close-drawn cap
 rabbit-hunting 

   im wasting sleep  you replied
hutton in high disdain

  without further contention he lounged

down upon the ballast and sunk his face
in the crook of his arm

   what are you young coddymoddies
squawking about demanded bayard
the engineer in good-natured drawl as
he sat up with slow deliberation beside
them in the gloom  are you too strong
to sleep when you get a ten - minute
chance at it 

   oh hutton here thinks he is edu-
cating me some replied acre

   say bayard if you were to be in a
head-ender right now-to-night-where
you could-see the other fellow coming at
us in time what would you d after you
had shut off and set the brakes hop
right then or stay on and fiddle with the
lever

  sunny-s eyes were very bright his face
was very young and brave-looking his
blouse and overalls were stiff and new-
hardly smudged in fact-and so while
they had lain waiting in the silence of
the mountain - top under the brilliant
studding of the stars and a low quar-
ter-moon he had fallen into huttons
old pet discussion

  meanwhile bayard with his head
upon a tie-end and his weary body
stretched upon the stone ballast of the
road-bed had slept-briefly but well-
beside them in the deep shadow of his
silent engine

  bayard forty-eight years old by the
calendar and twenty years old at engine-
running was a man of slow speech and
reputed wisdom for all of the twenty


the railroad mans magazine

years he had deliberately avoided giving
the answer to that question of staying or
jumping although each new fireman-
arid nearly every new brakeman - had
asked it in turn

  and now he did not answer it as pro-
pounded by sunny acre instead he
arose leisurely and after a wide-spread
yawn with his face to the sparkling sky
shook himself fully back to the joy of
living

  he walked slipped and stumbled
agilely down the slight bank of loose
sandstone ballast then climbed a pace or
two until he stood before the clear rill
of mountain water that fell in cool drip-
pings from the near-by rocks he drank
his fill from the half shell of a coconut
and laid it carefully edge downward in
its accustomed niche of rock

  then he looked at the pair of deeper
shadows that marked the now reclining
and silent orators in the shadow of the
engine  listened to the far faint murmur
of the first section of opposing freight
laboring up from somewhere down in
the pass looked up again at the wide
star-lit expanse of summer sky and knew
that he was going to answer sunny
acres question squarely then and from
the depths of his soul

  for the world that he knew best-that
great silent starlit world-was good to
live in and he would answer accord-
ingly

  what would i do he repeated at
length in deep and measured tones across
the short intervening space

  the shadowy figures of hutton and
acre at once sat bolt upright by the en-
gine

   ive side-stepped that question long
enough to give every man on this divi-
sion that wants it a chance to hold up the
traditions of the high heroic and
now im going to answer it for my
own account bayard continued without
prompting

   if i was to be in a head-ender to-
night or to-morrow or any other night
or day id shut off set the brakes re-
verse on general principles-and climb
off

   id jump as far clear of the engine
as i could and keep on end run as fast
as i could and keep on running until i
got arrested for violating the speed limit

got knocked down or until kindling quit
flying

   and he added with much delibera-
tion  if i had time id surely advise
you fellows to do the same but i
wouldnt wait a second longer to see
whether you were coming with me

   now if you will write that on the
roundhouse call - board first time shes
clear ill sign it or you can tell windy
lou the wanderer and that will have
the same effect of publicity

   but dont you get any wrong idea
from that always do what you can be-
fore you unload-but unload quick when
you need to

  that was the sum total of bayards
unexpected declaration and resisting all
enticements held out by the promptly re-
newed wrangle of hutton and acre he
bared his well-thatched gray head to the
cool of the night and withdrew into his
habitual silence as precipitately as he had
emerged from it

  no specious plea against that final
precious help that may possibly be drawn
from careful reversing at the last even
though the brakes be fully set no clever
application of the theory of increased co-
efficients of friction at slower speeds as
acre had newly coined it no begging of
the question as to whether it is the run-
ning of the first twenty or the last
twenty feet after brakes are set that
causes the slaughter in collision served
to incite bayard to further discussion

  his position was clear and final

  do what you can for others for your
train and for yourself shut off warn
jump run and keep on running

  it did not sound at all heroic barely
civil in fact but bayard quite com-
posed and quietly happy in his work and
his surroundings climbed aboard in due
time after the meeting and passing of
the first freight section was accomplished
read his latest order once more for cer-
taintys sake arid started for the bottom
of the pass with a clear conscience and
a track supposed lo be equally clear

  he caught the top buttons of his cor-
duroy coat into place as the night breeze
grew keener with moderately increased
motion - corduroy was the one visible
foible of bayard-and he lifted his stout
corduroyed leg to his favorite position
astride the nicely balanced reverse-lever
why bayard stayed

ill

and settled comfortably to the business
of running down the curving grades

  hutton and acre hunched up together
on acres seat-box were still debating
with unflagging zeal they had not ar-
rived at a conclusion when the engine
reached the bottom of the pass and
struck into the rather sharp left curve
around the base of the mountain

  on acres side of the engine the verti-
cal rock-wall continued close to the cab-
window on bayards side the first fun-
nel of the valley lay wide and smooth
with range-grass there they met the
second section of freight without note or
notice coming to them at a spanking
pace on the single track

  it is of no present consequence how
they got there perhaps except that
bayard was running correctly on his or-
der and the other crew had misread the
meeting - point and so the meeting-
point having been suddenly transposed
without notice while hutton and acre
were busy with their own opinions on
the obstructed side of the engine-view it
was bayard who first caught the rocking
gleam of the coming headlight and
voiced a brief warning

   j ump  this side   he shouted and
that was all except one short bark from
the whistle which the other engine in-
stantly echoed in kind

   for the rest of it he thrust the throttle
shut upon the thread of steam which he
had been using toward the level swept
the brake-valve to its fullest duty as his
hand fell from the throttle and with
his feet still astride of the quadrant and
one of them resting upon the strong steel
footrest which projected from the side of
the quadrant he pulled the lever back
sharply released the latch and attempt-
ing to get to his feet lunged half out of
the window intending to swing his feet
up and leap clear

  instead of leaping however he turned
hastily back after one longing straining
glance at hutton and acre fleeing safely
under the quarter moon across the range
grass and then he attacked the reverse
lever fiercely in the effort to reset it
elsewhere in the quadrant

  that was the last fleeting view hutton
and acre had of him struggling in wri-
thing outline against the dim cab-lights
until after all was over

  they stood watching with shortened
breath as the great shadowy hulks of
the engines bore down resistlessly upon
each other while little jets of fire spurt-
ed from the grinding brake-shoes upon
the wheels all along the cars crowding
up darkly from the rear

  sunny acres arms were unconsciously
stiffened in grotesque arcs like those of a
frogs front legs in poise for leaping and
his outspread fingers were set wide and
separately as extended claws

  hutton close beside him ankle-deep
in the brown grass leaned forward open-
mouthed in that last moment when the
senses of the onlooker undergo a sort of
palsy and colliding engines deceptively
seem to halt just before striking

  then with a brakemans last resort
when all else had failed he let go a pier-
cing quavering yell that was swallowed
up in the crash of the impact leaped
once straight up from the ground and
started racing back toward the grinding
and smoking jumble in the half darkness
 the tracks

  all of it was very briefly done the
opposing pilots thrust their steel-shod
noses together crunched and crumpled
headlight glasses fell shattered and clink-
ing upon the crushed forward decks the
muffled roar of collapsed front-ends fol-
lowed and the front-ends lifted from
the trucks a little space like belligerent
goats in their first preliminary of battle
then settled jerkily down

  the dull rumble of the suddenly
stayed trains quickly subsided in both
directions and these things were about all
that marked the occasion in the usual
way except that the erring freight-crew
had leaped and run and had joined hut-
ton and acre at a safe distance before
the broken glass had ceased falling

  bayard was the one unaccountable
unit of the whole transaction when the
four fugitives had come hurrying back
and climbed upon bayards engine they
found him standing bolt upright in al-
most military severity except that his
feet were astride of the quadrant and his
hand was upon the top end of the reverse
lever he was chewing a stub of match
stem and looking with a faded sort of
smile out into the dimly lighted valley

   matter bayard did it get you
asked one of them in kindly concern
 

the railroad mans magazine

while yet clambering up the distorted
engine-step

   nope replied bayard serenely

   then why in cain didnt you un-
load   demanded the same voice

   were in bad enough no use
scaring the souls out of the rest of the
gang is there

   say exclaimed bayard with sud-
den testiness of speech  i wouldnt
worry any about that if i were you
im on my beat all right aint i 

  i was  staying by her understand
brave engineer stayed at his post eh

   now you fellows had better climb
your own engine and well see if we can
back em apart then you can begin to
figure out how you got here on my time

  through it all bayard stood firmly
erect he maintained his clutch upon
the reverse lever and his clinch upon the
match stem until the others had depart-
ed and only sunny acre was left in the
cab with him

  then bayards heroic pose underwent
a sudden change it gave place to fever-
ish activity

   sunny he commanded in quick in-
sistent undertone  grab hold of this re-
verse lever and help me throw it over
forward

   the left leg of these cursed cordu-
roys is caught and jammed between the
lever and the quadrant and i could
neither tear loose nor throw her

  a lusty pull or two from sunny with
his back to the boiler-head and his foot
upon the end of the seat-box added to
bayards earnest but cramped efforts did
it and bayard stood free examining his
traitor garment

   thats why i stayed sunny and
if you ever tell it youre no friend of
mine

   i tried hard enough to get away but
this stuff im wearing is too good for
the job

  with that bayard rolled both legs of
his overalls up above the knees searched
out his pocket-knife and carefully ampu-
tated both corduroy trouser - legs just
below the knees he was anything but
a heroic figure as he kicked the severed
partsfree of his feet and rolled his over-
alls down to place

  sunny thawed out of his fright apd
well into the reaction clung weakly to
the throttle fulcrum and laughed while
he wept

  before bayard added his efforts to
those of the other engine-crew in backing
clear of the tangle he opened the fire-
box door tossed the discarded sections
of torn corduroy into the still flourishing
fire and quickly latched the door upon
them

  this is the how and the why of bay-
ards staying at his post that is to say
staying longer than to others seemed
necessary yet bayard is quite as good
as the best men who ever ran locomotives
and he never shirked a duty because of
danger

 it may also show why when he made
his next trip out on the road and there-
after bayard wore anything that suited
his fancy except corduroy and if
sunny acre had not shamelessly broken
the embargo of secrecy which bayard
placed upon him bayarcks real reason
for staying might never have found its
way here

one of the many readers of the railroad mans magazine recently

happy we wish that by some magical power we could gratify
our correspondents desire so far as the first part is concerned but after all
the telling of a story-at least such stories as mr willets writes-is not the
whole thing it is hearing them

     we dare say that mr willets heard hundreds of stories while riding

sign reading

a meeting of tiie locomotive firemen
of this division will take place in this hall
this evening for the purpose of initiating

   within the  hall amid the black dia-

-of course not yet even at that time

number of railroad adjuncts in tucson
to cause the town to be regarded through-

  it was only natural then that this
arizona metropolis should be the first
town in ihe southwest to form a lodge
of the brotherhood of locomotive fire-

  after mr huntington gave the town

   gents the thirteenth member of this

and our brand put onto him the ser-
geant-at-arms will kindly bring in frank
sargent commonly known on this divi-

  and thats how where and when
frank sargent joined the brotherhood of

name because frank sargent within live
years of his initiation at tucson became
grand master of the brotherhood and
later commissioner-general of immigra-

post when he died in september 

 vermont  gets his start

  about six months previous to that night
when the brand was put onto frank sar-

   well vermont if you allow you can

  and thats how when and where
frank sargent became a railroad man
beginning as engine-wiper at tucson he
was so quick in learning everything about
a locomotive that in six months he became
a fireman and a member of the local lodge
of the brotherhood

  and frank sargent became grand
master of the brotherhood after only five
years experience as a railroad man that
is easilv understood however if vou listen

to stories they tell at tucson of how sar-
gent or  vermont as he was known
down there acquired the popularity
among firemen that led to his election
in such short order to the highest office
within the gift of the brotherhood

  the tucson men will tell you that very
soon after sargent quit wiping to fire an
engine a man named snelling loomed up
in tucson riding the rods and was ac-
costed by vermont thus

   whats the sense of being an outcast
snelling a fine fellow like you when you
can be a real man among men the
job of wiper in the engine-house is vacant
here and now and if you say the word
you can have a chance to make a man of
yourself

  snelling took the job became ultimate-
ly a fireman-and throughout his life
would have given his heart for voung
 vermont

  once a fireman named garner chucked
up his job and mounted a horse to ride
away into the desert

    im tired of railroadin garner said
to  vermont  im going to hit the
trail for globe

    oh youll come back all right said
 vermont  with conviction in his voice
 youll want your job back same as
soldiers always went to reenlist ive
heard many a bunkie say at the expira-
tion of his enlistment that he would not
come back but they always came back
all the same

garner came back

   now im going to arrange with
yardmaster mant for you to come back
on your own job and your own run any
time within four months ill tell mant
youre hitting the trail as a sorter vaca-
tion-see i reckon two months vaca-
tion will be your limit garner

   and say i want you to do something
for me up at globe theres a widow
up therenamed halpin shes one of the
bravest women in arizona shes got
three sons and all three of em together
with the widow arecrack shofs

   many a time after they had been
besieged by apaches at their cabin in
superstition mountain ive ridden up
there with others of my troop to clean
out the enemv only to find that the wid-


riding the rail from coast to coast



ow and her sons had been standing oft
the apaches for days and made the in-
juns think that about two dozen sharp-
shooters were in garrison in that cabin

   well now garner two of those
sons have married and settled in globe
and the widow is living there too but
the third son is still scot-free of petti-
coats fie used often to say to me that
he wanted to hike out to tucson and
get a job on the railroad just as soon
as his shootin-irons were no longer need-
ed to protect his mother

   so i want you to bring that third son
back here with you and ill get mant
to put him on the espee pay-roll itll
make a man of him in a new way and
ill tell mant youre off on recruiting
service-for we need men here

wheeler presently got to dabbling in cop-
per-mines leaving mrs wheeler in town
to run the shop

  the bride gamely took up the work
drummed up trade sold trappings to the
teamsters who hauled oxe-wagons to and
from the mines and even invented and
patented a new kind of hame and col-

a man named sneiling loomed up in tucson

  two months later just the time named
in vermonts prediction garner rode
back into tuscon and with him came
the third son of the widow halpin gar-
ner got his own job and his own run
back just as  vermont  had promised
and young flalpin was put to wiping in
the engine-house at forty a month

  this made two more friends for  ver-
mont and it is with no end of stories
of this kind that the men of tucson
illustrate for you how  vermont  sar-
gent gained the popularity that put him
at the head of the brotherhood of loco-
motive firemen after he had been rail-
roading only five years

mrs wheelers store

  thirteen years ago a man from roch-
ester new york and his young bride
-mr and mrs abram wheeler-came
to tucson and opened a harness-shop

lar for teams of six horses or more haul-
ing ore

   that there is a plucky little woman
said foreman joe harrington formerly
of the engine-house but now of the shops

   she deserves to succeed and what i
allow is that it is sad and sorrowful
that us railroaders dont need harness
and so make business for the little
woman

  soon after that a boss teamster from
the mines drove into tucson with an
eight-horse team hitched to an ore-wag-
on the harness on the outfit being in
shreds and tied together with ropes in
a makeshift fashion

   had a accident with these pestif-
erous horses announced the boss team-
ster ash fork pete  and now im
goin to telegraph to el paso for new
harness waitin here till the same comes
up on the train

  harrington and the boys who heard


the railroad mans magazine

this looked at one another significantly-
and forthwith went into executive ses-
sion with the following result

  when ash fork pete stepped into the
telegraph office at the station to send
his wire to el paso some twenty of the
tucson railroad men headed by har-
rington advanced upon the telegraph
office in a body and their leader stepped
tip to the teamster and said 

and  ash fork  bought

   ash fork we have decided that
home industry is worthy of the patronage
of all outfits headquartering along this
railroad for those who gallivant round
this metropolis of tucson in particular
we recommend a certain harness - shop
as is attended to capable by mrs
wheeler

   and what we have come to con-
cerning this matter is that folks that
send needless to el paso for harness
trappings is like to find this metropolis
some malarious hereinafter

    you sees we dont have no call for
sich harness we being railroad men but
when we finds others as do need it we
proposes to steer em on the trail of mrs
wheeler she has hames and collars good
as any from el paso and they can be
had without sending her no telegram

  but i dont want no home-made
hames and collars gents speaks up
ash fork pete

  yes you do ash fork twenty
guns were flashed into sight surrounded
by those twenty guns ash fork was
marched to the harness - shop of mrs
wheeler and not permitted to issue forth
until he had purchased what he needed

in the greasewood

   in its flight across arizona my train
was held up twice the first was at a
tank station in the desert and there we
stood for three hours all because of some-
thing unheard of in the east but com-
mon in the southwest

  there was not a drop of water in the
tank that would have been nothing
serious had there been any gasoline with
which to pump water for the lack of
a spoonful of oil we could not budge

  the second involuntary pause was in

the greasewood miles from nowhere be-
tween mescal and benson and a wreck
ahead was the cause here we stood for
seven hours

   i was glad of both these delays and
the chance to roam around in the grease-
wood because in these periods of train
idleness i had long talks with old man
streamer old-time cowboy and railroad-
er he was one of the excursionists in
the special train behind us which when
we stopped poked her nose right into
the platform of our observation-car

   the special was carrying a large num-
ber of southwesterners to mexico city
a one-way fare for the round trip with
the stopping of the trains the passen-
gers from the two trains commingled to
pass the time away with rambles on the
desert

    i shore am enjoying the big delight
at meeting you said old man streamer
in greeting  im traveling this away
now as a towerist i being out for a holi-
day  that towerists train yonder bound
for mexico city but days ive traveled
ini away though and he indicated the
men in the caboose of a freight that was
stalled near our own trains

old streamer chews the fat

    yes son after  quit cow-punchin i
went to railroadin and stayed at it till
i got some sixty-three wrinkles on my
horns i saved the money instead of
straddling it over the territories like
those yere softhorns you see around on
railroads and by savin that away im
rble now to travel as a towerist and see
things leisure-like before i close my lids
for the life everlastin

   during that stop in the greasewood i
strolled around with old man streamer
listening to his endless chain of tales
until he finally said

    lets camp right yere son seating
himself on the dobe and lighting his cob
pipe and ill tell you before i forgit
it about my friend frank baker and
how he come to be a bull-fighter

    franks a engineer on the colorado
midland i was traveling on his train
only a few days ago-out of new mex-
ico and going up buena vista way-
when frank allowed the time had come
when lie ought to turn toreador
riding the rail from coast to coast



    it was this a way all of a sudden
  the train stopped and we-all got out to
 see whats ailin frank whatever do
 you think was ailin of him why
 nothin less than a mad bull which was
 facin the pilot with planted horns and
 boldin us up for fair right in the middle
 of the rails

     that son of a sea-cook gored a
 track-walker down a piece says frank
  i saw the gorin i did and now here
 he is standin us off with that frank
 ups and heaves some coal at the toro but
 the toro acts like he enjoys the festivities
 and swishes his tail and snorts like lies
 saying as how hed like to chew some-
 bodys mane

in the matador business

     ill fix that cow swears frank
 jumping off his cab and advancing on
 the mad bovine with his firemans shovel
 in his hand

     that aint no cow says alf hogan
 the fireman  thats an infuriated male
 head of cattle

     i know it says frank an i in-
 tend to turn this yere desert into a bull-
 ring

    frank charges the bull just like the
 matador in the ring using the shovel for
 a sword also the bull charges frank
 -with results and consequences mighty
 painful to frank that bull pushes his
 horns into frank enthusiastic as if he
 meant to feed and bed down on engi-
 neers the rest of his life hut that hope
 was cut short by a shot from a gun in
 the hands of hogan the fireman

    we picked frank up decernin that
 he was -some unnatural from the gorin
 hed had hut im a mex if frank

 surrounded by twenty guns ash fork
 was marched to the harness-shop

 werent game all the same  lift me
 onto my cab says he instanter minute
 he come to

   afid hanged if he didnt seize hold
of the throttle and set out to run that
train to buena vista but soon he falls
off his box in a dead faint from loss of
blood and the fireman has to take the
train in

   we carried frank to his teepee on a
nice little reservation that he had staked
out for to live on and we thought he
was sure to come abreast of the bright
and shinin gates before night

   all the same he did have a hard
pull for life and i allow that the next
time his train is stood up by a mad bull
with the blood hunger frank baker will
remain in his cab instead of goin forth
to play matador

 highpockets  rattler

   nother friend of mine continued
old man streamer while still  camped 
on the dobe  is a santa fe engineer out
of lamv new mexico hes a rattle-
snake fancier he is his name is high-
pocket smith

   one day while lolling  a lonely
sidin highpocket sees a wounded rat-
tler and out of sheer good nacher to-


the railroad mans magazine

ward wild animals highpocket picks up
the rattler and carries him home and
nurses him back to health and long life

   and its gospel im tellin you son
as any railroader in new mexico will
tell you that highpocket never had to
say  how sharper than an infants
tooth it is to have an ungrateful serpent
that rattler showed his gratitude-he
did

   one night highpocket awoke out of

   the plan was this looping him-
self around jerrys bedpost the rattler
put his head in the --watch-pocket of
jerrys vest and the minute six oclock
ticked the rattler rattled his rattles till
jerry woke yes son you just arsk
jerry hell tell you-hes got the cheap-
est and best alarm-clock on the whole
santa fe system

  the old man remained silent awhile
during which time i neither spoke nor

frank charges the bull using the shovel for a sword

a sound sleep to hear rattlers rattling
right beside his bedside he jumps up
follows the windings and twistings of
the rattlers body through the house till
he comes down to the dining-room where
he sees the snakes body coiled round the
body of a burglar boldin th burglar
hard and fast sos highpocket could nab
him

and jerry woke up

   and then there was jerry muskovitz
rodman on the santa fe working at
helen new mexico jerry was a snake
lover too just like highpocket and he
too rescued a rattler in distress the
snake followed jerry home and lived
with him a whole lot and that time
when jerry got jacked up for not show in
up for work early enough of mornins
the rattler got to thinkin how he could
help his benefactor and at last hit onto
a plan

barely breathed for my experience has
taught me never to ask an oldster a
single question after a while as i had
banked he would do the old man cleared
his speaking-valves and opened up again 

   but serious son have you ever
heard of black jake the train-robber
sure you have i knowed it well
black jake was the only man in the
southwest that ever induced me to quit
my job voluntarily and take a vacation

   he made me lose a lot of pay black
lake did and when i think of the
money i might have saved while taking
that vacation in his behalf it makes me
nauseated

at third-drink time

   black jake was for awhile the terror
of all trainmen in these territories he
robbed trains right and left first on the
santa fe then on the espee and we
never knowed where hed show up next
riding the rail from coast to coast	

ned ride into a cow town at first-drink
time in the evenin take a swig of nose-
paint then go out arid stand up a train
and return to the joint in time for a bit
of nose-paint at third-drink time

   he was absolute fearless black
jake was and he swore hed never be
taken alive him bein one of those gun-
men that could shopt off the hip

    well i had a friend a pardner he
sure was to me who was express mes-
senger on the santa fe his name were
will yum klaber and he was as absolute
fearless as black jake or auy other ban-
dit known to us boys

   so when one night in june some
eleven or twelve years gone now when
black jake and his gang held up the
santa fe overland train west of gallup
new mexico and ordered willyum kla-
ber to fork over the sack of gold and
currency that was there present will-
yum klaber whips out his gun and be-
gins lettin fly permiscus

   the next time i saw willyum he
was dead of course for black jake
attended to him instanter on the occasion
when willyum refused to obey the ban-
dits-orders black jake  that occa-
sion also dynamited the express-car and
got the sack of gold and currency

lure for bandit-trailers

    immediate the santa fe posted five
thousand dollars reward for black jake
dead or alive well son that reward
brought more bandit-trailers and profes-
sional takers of train-robbers to new
mexico and arizona than we ever sees in
these territories before or since i reckon
there was fully a hundred men working
independent and in posses try in to run
down black jake dead or alive

    it was then that i myself knocked
off work on the line and allowed id de-
vote a vacation to takin black jake and
earnin that five thousand black jake
had killed my bosom partner willyum
klaber i would avenge willyum and
scoop in the reward shore too

    so i outfits and sets off on a mus-
lang gallivantin round the uninhabited
regions of arizona along the line of the
arizona and new mexico railway that
runs up to clifton arizona where it was
said black jake and his gang retired

after standin up the overland that time
at gallup

    i cavorts around bushwackin in and
 out of cow towns at first second and
 third drink times but never a smell of
 black jake do i get finally i hears that
 he has been trailed to some place mighty
 near to clifton i had been on the trail
 and off it for some six weeks then and
 i was dead sick of the job of avengin
 willyum and tryin to earn that reward
 but  decided that id make one more
 try up clifton way to get black jake

cornered at last

     after three days ift the saddle i rides
 into clifton red-hot on the very heels of
 black jake-only to hear one of the hun-
 dred professional bandit-takers employed
 by the santa fe say

     good news mr streamer black
 take is in that prison at clifton thats
 hewed out of the solid rock and is one
 of the most unique prisons in this or any
 other country  presume mr streamer
 that congratulations are in order from
 you you bein particular friend to will-
 yum klaber the same havin been slaugh-
 tered by black jake-since  am the one
 who landed jake prompt in the stone
  wickiup

    oh yes son i congratulated that
 feller you believe the hour bein sec-
 ond-drink time i allowed it was in order
 to proceed to the joint in the red light
 and there clink the crystal in token of
 his glad news we clinked and then i
 hiked back to the rails resolved never
 again to quit wages to avenge some
 friend not even if i found another will-
 yum klaber

    concernin of that same prison thats
  hewn in the solid rocks at clifton ill
 come again and then i guess ill get
 back to my fellow towerists which has
 arsked me to set in a game of poker

the clifton bastile

    before proceedin with what im now
 opening up on i must paint you a pic-
 ture of that prison it is composed of
 three big cells forming the letter  t the
 same having been blasted out original by
 a mining company for the incarceratin
 of miners that were needin punishment


the railroad mans magazine

   the prison has for entrance a dobe
hut that stands not ten feet from the
tracks of the arizona and new mexico
railway the tracks of the railway run
along there between the entrance to thfe
prison on one side and the san francisco
river on the other

   close to the dobe hut that forms the
entry to the prison there is a switchmans
hut and another hut where the prison

the spring of  the san francisco
river cut loose and flooded things per-
miscus it riz anct it riz till it reached
the dobe huts at the entrance to the
prison it riz-that is so quick-like-
that it carried off the guard and all but
drowned the switchman

    i think it pretty safe to say that in all
my born days i never see a river that riz
as high as that one

    in the mornin while
the flood was still ragin
the switchman he bein
perched on top of the dobe
hut at the entrance to the
prison became aware that
some men of the town of
clifton on the opposite
bank of the river was try-
in to attract his attention

   the switchman watch-
ed and presently he sees a
big sign-a board-raised
-on high bearing these
words writ with charcoal
by the sheriff of clinton
  get friday out of the
balliwax-

   friday son was the
lone and only prisoner
then in the jail he bein
in durance vile for seek-
in to make his fortune by
standin up a train of the
arizona and new mexico
railroad

   the switchman ac-
cordin now swims down
track to dry land and tells
the miners there what the
sign across the river says
the miners then takes
dynamite and jumps up to
the rock prison and sets to
work to blast out the pris-
oner friday

    they puts a charge into that cooler
that would have blown up a town making
a hole big enough to crawl through

but friday came not

     come out of the balliwax friday
the miners and the switchman cry in
chorus but friday came not neither
did he show up to take advantage of his
blessed liberty

it carried off the guard and all but drowned
the switchman

guard lives-that guards principal work
bein to pass food through the bars of the
prison window - bars fastened in the
rock on the face of the cliff-to the pris-
oners

   on the prison side of the river is
mostly the prison and the mines on
the other side of the river is the town
f clifton now have you got all that
fixed in your mind

    f so i may proceed to state that in
riding the rail from coast to coast



   so inwards step the miners and the
switchman to find friday wounded and
unable to move all on account of the
flying-stone effect resultin from the blast

    look here you-all moans friday
 what do you mean by trying to kill a
man in order to save his life 

   and now son did l say that would
be about all well this here poker-
game im scheduled to set into has re-
minded me of just one more and as
the trains give  sign nor signal smoke
of breaking camp  allow theres time
for me to frame up this supplement

   the poker-game reminds me of the
hand marshal moore drew up at phoenix
recent one of the railroad boys up there
phoned moore to come to the station on
a run and capture a lunatic that was
bucking and prancing around loose and
was frightening away possible patrons of
the maricopa and phcenix railway

   moore hikes down to the depot and
the boys there put him next to a mexican
known in the town as miguel ceres
miguel now looked tame enough to eat
out of the hand of almost anybody and
in reply to all moores questions he an-
swered rational-like and sane

dotty dialogues

    this yere aint no lunatic says
moore contemptuous addressing the boys

  and moore turns to go just then
up springs miguel and tags after moore
shouting what did you dowith all
those women-

    what women   arsks moore

    why all those ladies you sent up
in a balloon from this depot larst night 
 well son moore annexed that mexi-
can prompt but before he could get
away from the depot one of the boys out
of the ticket-office came runnin up to
him sayin

    marshal some one wants you  the
telephone

   moore goes to the wire and hears
some one arsk him to come at once to a
certain teepee in phcenix and take posses-
sion by right of eminent domain of a
crazy man the marshal thereby pinches
himself to make sure hes not in a dream
or sufferin from the treemers

   decidin that alls w-ell with him to
date-he takes the lunatic miguel in tow

and perambulates the nearest route to the
teepee at the street number mentioned on
the wire he enters the teepee and finds
a mexican lying on a cot and other mex-
icans standin round cryin

    take him prisoner marshal this
is antonio flores and hes got a fire in
his stomach

accordin to hoyle

   moore questioned antonio and an-
tonio answered accordin to hoyle

     this aint  crazy man announced
moore resultinly turnin to depart

   but just then the mexican  the
cot cried out

    oh this fire in my stomach i am
only a stove and some one has lighted a
fire inside of me

     are you a fire-eater  arsked moore
  no sc nor but im the fire-box of
a locomotive and soft eoal is making a
blaze inside of me

   hearing the which marshal moore
heaves a sigh despondent and gathers
in antonio flores alongside of miguel
ceres on the way up the street he
entrusts his two charges to the care of
the man at the cigar-stand while he calls
up the sheriffs office an says

    im sitting in the luny game lively
this morning i open the pot ive
drawn a pair

  after the seven - hour wait in the
greasewood we pulled on eastward
through benson cochise and boxvie in
arizona then to lordsburg new mex-
ico where passengers connected with the
arizona and new mexico railroad men-
tioned by old man streamer-that road
running up to clifton arizona

a dead sheep

  by the time i had passed through
the new mexico town of deming and
began running over the tail-end of the
division into el paso i was in posses-
sion of many stories of railroad life in
the last of the territories-of which the
following are given here as the most in-
teresting

  on the santa fe railroad south of
santa fe a train having engineer
reardon at the throttle was nearing the
arroyo chamez it was late in the af-


the railroad mans magazine

ternoon of july   as he rushecl
northward toward the arroyo reardon
saw a dead sheep lying on the right of
way

   looks like hed been drowned
reardon shouted to his fireman

  yes think the arroyo is spilling
over replied the fireman

  pretty soon they passed another dead
sheep and then a third

   there was more than one animal in
that arroyo when the spill came said
reardon slowing down they passed
two more dead sheep and then reardon
stopped dead remarking that a little in-
vestigation was in order

sixty cents a sheep

  reardon hated to stop his train for
he knew that every such stop cost his
company sixty cents that being the esti-
mated expense of bringing a train to a
full stop and of accelerating the speed
again to normal multiply sixty cents
by every dead sheep you pass and it
will amount to many dollars in time
nevertheless reardon decided that so
many carcasses were nothing less than a
warning of something unusual going on
at the arroyo chamez

   what i want to know is how did
these carcasses get here he said

    its mighty wet hereabouts said the
fireman  looks like the arroyo had
been sending a gush of water down the
line

  and as the two men advanced on foot
to investigate lo a wall of water was
seen approaching-a sight that made
them scamper back to their cab the
water rushed by flooding the floor of
the cab and putting out the fire in the
engine

  the water subsided quickly however
and when reardon and others of the
train crew walked up track again to in-
vestigate they found hundreds of dead
sheep moreover they found that some
three hundred feet of track had been
washed away this side of the arroyo also
that the trestle over the arroyo was gone

   cloudburst  announced a track-
walker  itll take twenty-four hours
to relay track and reopen communica-
tion by rail with santa fe so you fellows
might as well hit the hay

  its good i didnt mind spending
sixty cents to take a peek said rear-
don with a self-satisfied smile

a terrific tank

  the most novel load ever hauled by
rail was under the direction of emmett
stansel foreman of bridges and build-
ings with the assistance of engine 
engineer weedon and conductor mike

calls up the sheriffs office aw says-

murphy all of the new mexico divi-
sion of the santa fe

  the novelty of the load lay in the
height and width of the thing hauled
it was as high as eight ordinary men
it was as high as that four-and-a-half-
story office building in albuquerque it
was as wide as a city lot it weighed
 pounds

    it was one of our standard steel
tanks said my informant  now if
you want something clumsy to wrestle
with in the freight-traffic way justyou
attempt to move that fcind of a tank four
miles over two curves with an elevation
of five inches-for thats the distance
we moved that big tank and such were
the conditions of the same
riding the rail from coast to coast



   our foreman emmett stansel sure
knew his business he first lifted that
tank off its foundation then he raised
it up with jacks till it was high enough
in the air for us to back two steel flat
cars under it when the tank was all
braced and fastened down an engine
was hitched on and the novel moving
took place successful-from springer to
the new springer yards

   queerest load ive ever seen and

turing no end of desperate criminals
in july  he had been in williams
three years becoming a successful boss
contractor

  one day a stranger walked up to
frank sherlock and asked for a job
after a second look at sherlock the
stranger said  how  

  how answered sherlock peering
sharply at the stranger without an-
other word from either of the men sher-

- im sitting in the luny-game lively this morning

i open ti-ie pot

 ive drawn a pair

ive been in the traffic department of
the santa fe ever since we hauled the
first train through new mexico thirty
years ago nothing could get bv the
train pulling that tank you bet cause
we occupied abotft all the right of way
there was our load being some twenty-
four feet wide the diameter of the tank
and forty-three feet in the air it was
the clumsiest package of freight the
santa fe or any other toad has ever
had to carry

meeting sherlock

  before coming to williams frank
sherlock had for eight years served as
deputy sheriff of mojave county cap-

lock put the stranger to work under his
own eye

  in two weeks however sherlock dis-
charged the new hand-for good rea-
sons two days later the stranger was
seen holding whispered converse with
one of the youngest of the arizona
rangers named woods on the third
day woods rode up to where frank
sherlock was directing the operations
of his men pushed a pistol into sher-
locks abdomen and exclaimed

  youre under arrest-charlie bly  

   no necessity for the shootin-irons
said sherlock or blv quietly  that
discharged skunk has been talking to you
thats easy to see i guess youve got
me kid


the railroad mans magazine

  the next day conductor osgood on
the overland punched a ticket that read
 from santa fe to williams to
the holder thereofosgood said

bringing him back

   hallo captain christman youre
going some way from your corral im-
portant business 

  yep im ma-
k i n g passenger
traffic for this road

bringing back a
prisoner

  next day con-
ductor osgood
now east - bound
from williams
again went through

 good lord
exclaimed osgood

 you dont mean
that your prisoner is that contractor at
williams 

sure thing  replied the captain

   this man that you respect as frank
sherlock is charlie ely who rode away
from the pen in our territory eleven years
ago on the wardens horse

   an ex-convict from the same prison
whom sherlock alias bly employed a
few weeks ago and then discharged
recognized him and squealed  him in
the ear of that ranger young woods
at williams they told me that they in-
tend to petition for a pardon for their
fellow townsman-since for eleven years
he has lived an exemplary life

   well say cap remarked conduct-

does make queer bedfellows i hope
with the rest of the boys that the yap
that squealed on sherlock gets his

  and then without waiting for tireg-

he had been in the habit of occupying 
a certain stool and sat him down--only

chapter xiv	evidently trying to do something to post-

pone the torture

when the spokesman returned welch
left him to guard me and went in to see
captain hawson

 will you tell me what you have done
with the woman he asked

 i will not

 then well torture the boy until he
tells

you cowardly cur the captain
screamed  let the boy alone try to
torture it out of me

 i think the boy will be easier welch
said laughing

 you have no right to torture the
bov the captain said

if you insist well torture you first
welch replied angrily

 it will do you no good the captain
said

 well see welch cried  there is
nothing in the law to prevent me tor-
turing you you have given us enough
trouble why did you cut that hole in

began in the november  railroad mans magazine single copies  cents

                                       

 we create mysteries

        way hurried the man
           welch closed the door
           and sat down on one of
           the heavy chairs near it

                   go back to the bunk 
                he ordered me

  that order pleased me most the re-
volver captain hawson had taken from
the captured guard was in the bunk be-
neath the blanket

   lay down and pretended to sob
welch seemed sick and weak and once
he arose and opened the door and glanced
down the passage to see whether the man
was coming back as he did so i slipped
the revolver from beneath the blanket
and put it in my hip-pocket

  in the next cabin captain hawson was
cursing and trying to get free of the men
who guarded him he had heard welch
threaten to torture me of course and was


the railroad mans magazine

the cabin wall what have you done
with the woman  

  are there any more questions de-
manded the captain laughing mockingly

  welch cursed and ordered the men to
seize him when they had him in the
passage taking him to the temple-room
where the great aitu sat on his throne
the spokesman left me and went out and
locked the door

  welch was so intent upon the torture
that he forgot one thing-he had left the
door of the captains cabin open think-
ing -no one was in there and the hole was
still in the wall

  captain hawson fought them all the
way down the jjassage as soon as they
had gone some distance i crept to the
hole and peered through there was no
one in the captains cabin and  crawled
into it and ran to the door and looked
out there was but one man in the pas-
sage and as  watched welch called to
him and he-went into the temple-room

  i ran back to the panel  miss
ruth  whispered

   is that you roland 

   yes

-	what are they doing

   they are trying to make captain
hawson tell where you are

   you must let me out she said
 enough have suffered for my sake al-
ready

   i cannot do that i answered

   let me out roland please they
must not torture him

   i cannot let you out miss holland
 replied  they will kill you at sun-
rise if i do

   but we must not let them torture the
captain to save me she said

   the captain would blame me if i let
you out i said and uncle dick
would always blame me

   but we must try to do something
she said

   wait  i implored

  i ran to the door and looked into the
passage again all the men were in the
temple-room i went out quietly and
hurried in the other direction until i
came to the third cabin there i knocked
softly on the door

  who is there my uncles voice
asked

  it is roland uncle dick can you

break out they are torturing captain
hawson to make him tell where he has
hidden miss holland i have a revolver
and there is no one in the passage

    stand to one side he directed

  i stepped to one side and heard him
walking around in the cabin then there
was a crash as he hurled himself against
the door a second crash and the lock
snapped and the door burst outward
uncle dick stood beside me

  the noise of the breaking door had
been heard by those in the temple-room
and now they came pouring into the pas-
sage to see what it meant with uncle
dick at my heels i dashed into the cap-
tains cabin and together we slammed
the door shut and threw the table and
heavy chair against it

   quick  i cried to uncle dick

  i ran to the panel and opened it
 quick  get in with miss holland  
i whispered  that will puzzle them
more you cannot fight out here

   half pushed him into the alcove
dick i heard ruth holland say
and  saw him take her in his arms just
as i closed the panel

  the men were hammering at the door
forcing it open i ran to the hole in
the wall crawled through and threw my-
self on the bunk just as i did so the
door of my cabin opened and the spokes-
man hurried in he looked at me made
a peculiar noise in his throat then went
out again i heard him calling for welch

  as i lay upon the bunk i heard the
men jabbering in the captains cabin
welchs voice was raised in anger pres-
ently he came in to me

   you helped your uncle to get out of
his cabin he said

   what if i did i retorted

   where did you put him 

    he is not in here

   he is somewhere near the men saw
you enter the captains cabin hes with
miss holland where are they

   i have said they are not in this
cabin i said

   will vou tell me where they are 

   no

  he called two of the men and they
led me down the passage toward the tem-
ple-room there seemed no help for it
now torture awaited me unless there
was a chance for me to use the revolver
the daughter of the idol



  the men left the captains cabin all
except one left behind as guard and fol-
lowed us i was not used kindly as we
made that short journey down the pas-
sage welch grasped my injured arm
tightly so that the pain almost made me
cry out  but i did not give him the sat-
isfaction of hearing me do so

  captain hawson was standing just in-
side the temple - room door a man on
either side of him they stood me near
him facing the aitu

   will you tell what you have done
with your uncle and the woman  welch
demanded again

  i saw captain hawsons face light up
when welch mentioned my uncle

   they are together i replied to tell
the captain what had happened he
flashed me a look of commendation

  tell me where they are welch
cried  i have done with your nonsense
ill take your life-blood from you drop
by drop unless you tell 

   i will not tell i replied

  welch turned to one of the men who
was working at the foot of the steps
 get the hot iron  he commanded

  my uninjured arm was free i reached
to my hip quickly and got a grip on the
revolver the man started toward me
with the iron a wicked-looking instru-
ment white-hot

  my hand came up quickly the revolver
in it i fired not at any one of them
but into the roof of the cabin

  the shot had the desired effect the
men guarding us astonished at the shot
stepped aside for a moment that mo-
ment was all we needed i found the
captain beside me in the door found that
he was grasping the revolver tearing it
from my hand

   back to the cabin  he cried

  i took him at his word and turning
into the passage raced back toward the
cabin he came after me firing once
more as the first head showed at the tem-
ple-room door

  but we ran into more trouble as we
reached the cabin for the man left be-
hind as guard rushed at us captain
hawson fired again this time with effect
the guard toppled over in the passage
and the captain grasped his revolver and
ran on

  the others were coming down the

passage now uttering cries of rage urged
on by welchs screams and curses we
dashed into the cabin and slammed the
door the captain handed me my re-
volver and retained the one he bad taken
from the guard he had wounded

   into the alcove  he commanded

  the door swung back  we sprang in
and the panel closed again we heard
the others crash into the cabin shrieking
wildly and we heard their exclamations
of consternation when they did not
find us

   keep quiet the captain whispered
to us  this is a mystery that will cause
them some annoyance

  i felt some ones arm go around my
shoulders felt some ones lips brush my
cheek and heard ruths voice say

  boy boy

  and then a stronger arm was thrown
around me-uncle dicks and in the
position we were standing it must have
been around ruth holland too

      chapter xv
      we capture welch

vite heard welch come into the cabin

 where are they  he demanded

   they are gone master the spokes-
man replied

   gone where 

  i do not know when we entered
the cabin they were gone we saw them
run in here

   search the cabins  welch com-
manded

  we heard them rushing about opening
and closing doors running back and
forth through the passage and to the
deck after a time all of them returned

   we cannot find them master the
spokesman said  they are gone  they
have vanished we do not like this sort
of business

  the men were muttering among them-
selves

   silence  welch commanded  what
do you fear  they came into this cabin
and therefore they are some place aboard
the steamer there is no mystery about
it at all they simply have some hiding-
place that we have not discovered search
again

  we heard welch tell the spokesman
	the railroad mans magazine

to leave a guard on the cabins and that
he would have the ship searched from
one end to the other the men went
away and there was deep silence but
uncle dick whispered to me to remain
absolutely silent for one of the men
might be inside the cabin listening

  the alcove was very small and we
began to grow weary the air was get-
ting foul too it was daylight outside
now and the sea had calmed for the
steamer did not roll and pitch as for-
merly

  while we huddled there in the alcove
there was a tiny flash behind us and that
half-distinct crashing which i had heard
before when captain hawson worked at
the wireless now he uttered an excla-
mation under his breath

   what is it  uncle dick whispered
 it is the cruiser calling the captaiii
said  i gave them a private signal
when i was talking

   are you going to answer  ruth
asked

   it is risky business

   but they may have something im-
portant to communicate uncle dick
put in

 ill run the risk the captain said
we changed positions as noiselessly as
we could so that he could get to the
keyboard then he reached for the key
and answered the call

  his answer was acknowledged and the
message came he whispered it to ruth
and i for uncle dick could read it for
himself

  captain hawson

     on board steamer faraway
  cruiser will make island as rapidly as
  possible and land marines to protect
  you if you are already prisoners ashore
  when do you expect to arrive at
  island 

  captain hawson reached for the key
and replied

faraway should reach island within
forty-eight hours how near are you 

    we cannot reach island for at least
  three days

  the captain tapped in reply

    make it as soon as possible two of
  us are doomed to execution as soon as
  we are landed but well try to detain
  them

   o k wired the cruiser and then
the communication was broken

  no sooner had the message beenfin-
ished than we heard welchs voice in the
cabin again

   what was it he was asking

    some peculiar noise master so thi
guard says the spokesman replied  he
was standing in the center of the cabin
when he heard it it seemed to come
from the wall

    what sort of a noise 

    he said it sounded like tapping yet
not exactly lik that either he is be-
coming afraid all of the men are
becoming afraid these things must be
explained soon master or there will be
trouble if the men begin to fear-

   there is no cause for fear welch
said we are still searching the ship
they are somewhere on board

    but what is to be done master 

   jo up and take command of the
ship my wound weakens me welch
said and ill remain here on guard

   you want a man with you

    leave one man he instructed

  we heard the spokesman go away
heard welch talking to the one man left
behind he was trying to convince the
man captain hawson whispered to me
that our disappearance was not due to
any supernatural power

  another hour passed an hour in that
stuffy hole with its foul air and its dis-
tressing heat we were huddled so close
together that we could scarcely move

  if weonly had more room captain
hawson said once  id try another little
trick

  cannot one of us leave uncle
dick asked

    not miss holland for she is doomed
to die as soon as they find her the cap-
tain replied  the boy cannot go for
they will torture him they will torture
me too and you mr engle i fail to
see how any of us can leave in safety

    what is the little trick you want to
play   uncle dick asked

    i want to capture welch the cap-
tain answered

  and frighten the men to death
miss holland asked  is that your
idea

    yes

   but how will we gain anything by
the daughter of the idol



doing that she asked they would
only hurry to the island all the faster

    when superstitious men are frenzied
by queer happenings they make mis-
takes the captain said  a little mis-
take made at the right time may save
us if we could only remain in the
alcove until the cruiser arrives-

    that is impossible said uncle dick
it will be three days and well have
to get out of here within the hour the
air is foul already

    well have to fight for it then the
captain said

   then well fight for it my uncle
replied

  but what can we do the captain
demanded  if we could slip from the
alcove without any one seeing us and let
miss holland remain here with your
nephew all would be well we dont
want to betray miss hollands hiding-
place

  they ceased speaking for welch was
tapping on the panel it was evident
that he had either heard us whispering
-or had suspected the secret alcove his
investigation seemed to tell him nothing
however for we heard him leave the wall
and go back to the chair

    i-am growing faint he said to the
guard  jo to the medicine-chest and
get me liquor

  the man hurried away  now is your
chance my uncle whispered to the cap-
tain

  captain hawson touched the spring
and the panel slid back noiselessly in
a flash he and uncle dick were upon
welchs back and while captain haw-
son bound him uncle dick inserted a
gag in his mouth

chapter xvi

we receive a surprise

d efore any of us could make reply
we heard the guard hurrying along
the corridor ill never forget the look
on his face as he entered the cabin and
saw the four of us sitting against the wall
under the port-hole

he had a bottle of liquor in his hand 
and when he caught sight of us and saw
that welch was missing he dropped the
bottle on the floor then with an ear-
 r r

splitting scream that would have done
credit to an indian on the war-path he
fled up the passage

  we waited in silence while a chorus
of cries on the deck above warned us
that the guard had aroused all the crew
they came pouring down into the pas-
sage with the spokesman at their head
he came to a stop just inside the door
the others grouped about him his eyes
bulged his hands shook

  you have come back he gasped
none of us made reply

  where were you what has hap-
pened where is the master

  he shouted the questions at us as swift-
ly as his lips could form the words and
none of us made reply

   why dont you speak  he screamed
are you human beings or ghosts

  it was an unlucky word for him to
speak the men behind him looked once
screamed once then fled up the passage
again shrieking at each other

   come back come back  the
spokesman shouted at them in english
then realizing that they could not un-
derstand he shouted at them in his own
language and they came back one at a
time silently staring at us with fearful
eyes

  where did you come from the
spokesman demanded of the captain

   weve been in the cabin all the time
the captain answered

   where is mr welch 

   i am not keeping track of mr
welch replied the captain  perhaps
he is on deck

  he is not on deck - he was here
watching the cabin

   is that so the captain asked smi-
ling

  the spokesman took another step into
the cabin  however now that you are
here well attend to business he said
 there is a certain duty to perform and
it is already an hour past rise of sun

   you mean the execution of this young
lady the captain asked

   yes

   then there will be no execution
miss holland has reconsidered she is
ready to apologize before the great aitu
and to go on with the ceremony some-
thing displeased her before-that is why
she refused to be betrothed


the railroad mans magazine

  the mans face lit up what his peo-
ple most desired he knew was the mar-
riage of welch to miss holland

   what you say gives me great joy
he said  the ceremony shall be com-
pleted at once i will have you escorted
to the temple-room and will send a man
to search for the master perhaps he
was taken ill and retired to his cabin

  so we were taken down the passage
and to the temple-room again and there
uncle dick captain hawson and my-
self stood against the wall as before
while ruth went to the front of the steps
and stood ready and waiting

  the man returned with the intelligence
that welch was not in his cabin and
could not be found another man was
despatched and he too returned to say
that welch had strangely disappeared

  the spokesman seemed puzzled  why
do you not go on with the ceremony
the captain asked him  the great aitu
will be displeased if you postpone it
again

   the great aitu must have mercy the
spokesman muttered  there can be no
ceremony until the master is here to do
his part

   then let us go on deck and get fresh
air the captain said  send your
guards along the troubles of the night
have left us worn out miss holland
must have fresh air and rest or she will
not be able to continue the ceremony
when your master is found the wound
on her arm made by the hot iron has
sickened her do you want her to be ill
when the island is reached 

  his words seemed to bother the fanatic
for he ordered the men to take us on
deck and to serve us breakfast there
then the search for welch began again

  we really enjoyed those two hours on
deck after being confined below in the
alcove and i never relished a meal as
i did that breakfast we talked of or-
dinary things for the guards were al-
ways near us  and after we had finished
eating we sat back near the wheel and
watched the sunshine play upon the sea

  at the end of the two hours the spokes-
man came to us and addressed captain
hawson

   did you see anything of the master
where were you hiding why did you
show yourself again

   i havent time to answer questions
which do not concern me the captain
replied  are you going to continue the

ceremony  

   we cannot until the master is found
 then youd better hurry up and find
him the great aitu will be angry

  the spokesman hurried away crying
out his orders to the others another
hour passed and the guards squatting
on the deck near us prevented conversa-
tion except on ordinary topics finally
however when some of them were called
away to attend to other duties we found
that we could talk without being over-
heard

   what is to be our next move  un-
cle dick asked

  if we could get control of the ship-
the captain began

   you cannot uncle dick replied
 even if we conquer the men on deck
the engine-room force will learn of it
and will not obey your orders

   but we may be able to delay the
ship to give the cruiser a chance to over-
take us the captain said

  if we could do that- began uncle
dick

   we can try said captain hawson
  have you a plan

   we have two revolvers mine has
five cartridges in it how many has
yours roland  

    two sir i replied

   and we failed to get the one on
welch the captain said  that is what
comes of being in a hurry

  ruth holland smiled at us  i was
not in such a hurry she said  i have
welchs revolver i took it while you
were putting him in the alcove pie was
trying to hide it

   good girl  the captain cried

   there are six cartridges in it she
said

   that makes thirteen shots in all an
unlucky number the captain put in

   unlucky but perhaps not for us
said uncle dick now what is your
plan  

   let miss holland hand you the re-
volver she has when none of them are
looking he replied  well have to
make a fight for it theyll be careful
not to harm miss holland but the rest
of us will have to take our chances
the daughter of the idol



  he explained his plan at length and
then we arose and started forward as
though we were ready to go below again
the guard got up lazily to follow us
two other men moved toward us across
the deck

   wait the spokesman cried when he
saw us  i am not ready for you to go
below yet

  so we walked on toward the forecas-
tle for it suited our plans presently we
found ourselves forward of them all
with nothing between us and our old
barricade near the bowsprit

   now  captain hawson cried and
we made a dash for it

  those on deck realized our purpose
instantly before we had gained secur-
ity the bullets were flying about us but
none of them found a human target we
got down behind the barricade without
firing one of our precious shots

  the spokesman came running across
the deck toward us

  what do you mean he cried
 what are you doing up there  i am
ready for you to go below now

   we dont care to go below thank
you the captain said  we prefer it
up here

  ill send my men for you

   youll send your men below and
go with them and remain there the
captain said sternly  do so at once
or we open fire 

   you have no weapons the spokes-
man cried

   you see one replied the captain
holding up his revolver

   if you dont come down ill send
the men after you 

   send them  retorted the captain
the fanatic cried out an order and
the men swarmed toward us it looked
like the old battle over again when the
nearest man reached the barrier the
captain fired and the man fell the
others retreated but secured places of
safety and from their new positions
rained shots at us

   down all of you the captain or-
dered  let them waste their ammuni-
tion

  in a few minutes the firing ceased and
we looked over the barrier to see what
was taking place

   i give you one more chance to come

down   the leader cried  the great
aitu commands it death is to be pre-
ferred to dishonor and dishonor will
be my lot unless you are conquered so
come down or ill burn you out-burn
the ship with you-go out with you to
meet the great aitu in eternity 

  he held a firebrand in his hand and
as he spoke he waved it above his head

  will you come down he cried

  no captain hawson answered

   then ill burn you out 

   youll never live to apply the
torch   the captain cried

  he stood up and leveled his revolver
at the spokesman meanwhile watching
the others one of them fired and the
bullet whistled past the captains head

  he dodged behind the barrier

  and at the moment he dodged the
spokesman gave a scream and ran for-
ward with the burning brand in his hand
i saw it tossed above his head saw it
fall at the bottom of the mass of rope
and sail-cloth the flames sprang out
caught the cloth and began to eat their
way toward us

  then some one staggered forward
from the stern

  fools fools he screamed put
out the fire  

  it was welch

  whipped into action by his words the
men sprang forward to obey they threw
the burning cloth into the sea threw
the rope after it stamped out the flames
and while they did so we watched with-
out offering violence glad that we had
again been saved from death and won-
dering at the appearance of welch on
the deck

  we did not have to wonder long for
he was a natural boaster

   the next time you put a man in an
alcove he said  be sure that there is
nothing there on which he can saw his
bonds in two and be sure the panel is
so strong that even a wounded man can-
not crash through it 

chapter xvii
fair speech and false action

at first the full significance of what
welchs escape meant did not
strike us it was the spokesman who


the railroad mans magazine

running across the deck eagerly his face
lit up with a smile anxious to correct
himself in the eyes of the man he called
master for having set the fire first
brought to us a realization of what it
meant

   master master he cried  the
woman will go on with the ceremony
low that you have returned to us 

   ruth gave a little cry when she heard
him speak and i heard captain hawson
curse softly to himself

    now therell be a lot more trouble
uncle dick said this will be the
fight of fights

  welch was talking to the spokesman
but we could not hear what he was say-
ing captain hawson decided to take
the initiative and standing up behind
the barricade he called to those below

   miss holland absolutely refuses to
go on with the ceremony which is re-
pugnant to her the captain said

    then she must die immediately the
spokesman answered

   there are three of us here well
armed continued the captain  who
will fight to the death to protect miss
holland i serve notice upon you now
that if we are molested we shall shoot
moreover we are going to make an at-
tempt to get control of the ship again
and after one minute has passed well
fire on any one within range who tries
to oppose us

  welch turned to the spokesman and
talked rapidly in the mans own lan-
guage then they both went aft and we
saw no more of them for some time
the steamer continued on her way rush-
ing through the golden sea carrying
us to the strange land where there was
nothing to expect but death

   what do you think they will try to
do ruth holland asked of uncle
dick

   it is hard to tell he answered
 welch will try some bit of strategy
that is certain

   yes the captain said  but you
forget some things while welch is
angry enough to try any cruelty and
 though he wants to keep in the good
graces of the fanatics by pretending to
honor the laws of the great aitu yet
he does not wish to see miss holland
executed if he conquers us now and

we are captured he will have no excuse
for not ordering her executed immedi-
ately

   you think well not be molested
then my uncle asked

   i think well be allowed freedom un-
til the island is reached we ought to
reach the island by to-morrow morning
and it is now almost noon

  another hour passed and then welch
appeared again carrying a white cloth
fastened to a stick he stopped directly
beneath us

  what do you want  uncle dick
asked

   to talk with you may i come up 

   talk from where you are

   i dont want every one to hear he
said

   then one of us will come down
the captain said  but see that you try
no tricks for if you do youll never get
aft alive

    ill try no tricks- welch said

  uncle dick looked at the captain

   you go he said

  captain hawson left the barricade
and went to the deck below and stood
within a few feet of welch while he
talked uncle dick held his revolver
ready to use in case of treachery al-
though they spoke in low tones the wind
carried their words to us

   will you go to your cabins  welch
asked

  and be captured the captain de-
manded

   ill see that you are not molested
until the island is reached

   im sorry but i cannot rely  your
word replied the captain

   certainly you know said welch
 that i do not seek misshoilands death
and will do anything to prevent her exe-
cution before the island is reached i
have consulted the aitu before the men
and have told them that it is better to
let matters rest until we are at the island
and the high priest can judge you all
the men have agreed to that

   how do we know it is not a trick 
the captain asked

   youll have to take my word for it
if youll go to your cabins as prisoners
youll be treated with every courtesy
until the island is reached there the
high priest will judge you
the daughter of the idol



   you expect us to give ourselves up
to death without a struggle

   there is no way for you to escape
welch replied  from what possible
source could help come 

   perhaps even now it is very near
the captain said

   id advise you to go to your cabins
youll not be harmed while on board
ship we will leave everything to the
high priest

  we may retain our weapons the
captain asked

   of course i cannot allow that

   then we cannot think of returning
to the cabins the captain said firmly

   with weapons you may make an at-
tempt to regain the ship

   and without them we would be at
your mercy absolutely- i think well re-
main where we are

  just as you please welch said
 youll not be molested until we reach
the island anyway if you think joull
be more comfortable up there-

   well feel safer at any rate laughed
the captain

   ill send food to you in an hour
or so

   thank you replied the captain with
mock courtesy  and the food  pre-
sume may be eaten without any ill after-
effects

   you think id poison it  welch de-
manded

   my dear sir said the captain  i
think youd do anything on earth to
gain your personal ends this interview
should be terminated here i believe
why prolong it 

  as you please welch said again
 but youll be hungry before the island
is reached

   we had a very good breakfast

   but well not reach the island until
noon to-morrow

   then you are not sailing the ship
right the captain said  you should
be off the island at break of day

   if you are afraid  will poison the
food perhaps you will be willing to go
yourself to the galley and pick it out
said welch  there is a young lady in
your party it is not kind to her to make
her suffer from lack of food

   you expect me to walk into a trap 
the captain asked

   certainly not he answered  i
give you my word of honor that youll
not be molested

  your word of honor laughed the
captain

   i have tried to do the right thing at
this juncture welch said  youll not
accept the food i offer to send and youll
not go for it yourself

  captain hawson turned and looked
up at us then faced welch again

   will you clear the deck he asked
 and allow us to go to the galley as we
please to get this food will you send
all of the men below and go yourself
and let one of us guard the companion-
way while another reaches the galley
from the outside 

   yes welch answered

   very well then do so

  welch turned back to speak to the men
aft and the captain returned to us and
told his plans when the men had gone
below welch called to us and remained
standing near the mast

   mr engle  think it better for you
to remain here and protect miss hol-
land the captain said  ill take ro-
land with me

  do you not fear a trick uncle
dick asked

   i think we can take care of our-
selves the captain answered  at the
first sign of treachery ill send a bullet
through welch and this time it will be
the last wound hell ever receive

   very well said uncle dick

  the captain started down and i fol-
lowed him each of us holding a revolver
welch awaited us near the mast and
when we approached him he turned and
led the way aft to show us that his in-
tentions were good

  at the head of the companionway he
stopped for a moment

   go below and into one of the cab-
ins the captain directed  at the first
sign of treachery there will be trouble
welch did not reply but went below
i stood guard as the captain directed
watching to see that none of the men
came up captain hawson went to the
man at the wheel and searched him for
weapons finding none he went on to
the galley

  once or twice i looked forward but
there was no one on the deck there


the railroad mans magazine

was only the one way the men could
reach the deck forward and with uncle
dick watching there it was not likely
that any of them would try it

  just once i looked toward the stern
the man at the wheel had his eyes on the
open sea and so i turned from him and
watched the companiomvay wishing that
the captain would hurry for i did not
feel at all comfortable

  flow many minutes passed i do not
know but suddenly i heard the cap-
tains shout  look out boy  

   whirled toward him the man at
the wheel had lashed it and had crept
upon me as i turned he sprang hands
outstretched straight at my throat

  as captain hawson rushed toward me
across the dack fearing to shoot because
his bullet might strike me i threw my
revolver up before me and fired

  the man crashed to the deck at my
feet captain hawson reached my side at
the same instant from below and from
forward came a chorus of screams and
cries i heard uncle dicks revolver
speak saw the fanatics swarming onto
the deck forward and charging at the
barricade behind which my uncle and
ruth holland were entrenched

  and then i became aware that the cap-
tain was screaming something at me and
that more of the men were charging to-
ward us up the companionway

   with me roland it was a trick
after all  the captain cried

  we each fired one shot into the midst
of the swarm of men rushing up toward
us and then we started to flee aft if
we could reach the stern and drop down
the side and into the galley through a
port-hole we would be safe for a time
and could at least make a defense

  several bullets flew by us as we ran
but by dodging from place to place we
escaped harm we dropped over the
side safely the captain leading the way
he reached up to help me and we got
through the port-hole and into the after-
cabin a short run through the aft-
passage and we would be in the galley
they would have a hard time dislodging
us there

  but we were not able to reach the
galley some of the men were still in
the passage and seeing who we were they
opened fire welch had evidently told

them that the great aitu would be pleased
if the captain and myself were slain it
was only uncle dick because he was
doomed to execution and ruth hol-
land because they wanted her to wed a
priest that were exempt from present
death

  there was jio time then to reach the
galley and we dare not remain in the
passage the captain dashed before me
and fired and the nearest man dropped
without a sound the others held back

  the first door captain hawson
cried

  he fired again to cover our advance
and i crept through the passage at his
heels looking back to watch the com-
panionway we reached the door in
safety and turned from the passage into
the cabin the captain threw the door
shut

   bolt the door  i screamed

   there is no lock on this door he
replied  we are in their temple-room

  he struck a match and by its light we
beheld the priest on guard before the
aitu creeping upon us captain hawson
covered him with the revolver and he
held out his hands to show us that he
could do no harm

  up the steps the captain cried
to me

  once more i found myself at the foot
of the idol behind the draperies cap-
tain hawson remained at the bottom of
the steps holding the priest before him
in the passage outside the cabin arose a
bedlam of voices some one threw open
the door and showed a light

  back the captain cried when
the first man enters i kill your priest 

chapter xviii
a battle in the temple-room

vr our uncle cannot hold out long
the captain said  he has only
the one revolver and no extra ammuni-
tion

   and we have only two shots left sir
i said

   you are wrong there he said
 when i went to the galley i did not
look for food but for ammunition my
pockets are filled with cartridges

  he handed some of them to me and
the daughter of the idol



 i filled the cylinder of my revolver and
 put the remainder in my pockets

   a few minutes passed and then we
 heard the spokesman in the passage out-
 side

   will you come out and surrender
 he demanded

    no the captain cried

    then well come in and take you

    if you open that door ill kill your
 priest the captain cried  ill kill him
 at the feet of the aitu  

   screams and curses answered the cap-
 tains speech for the spokesman trans-
 lated it to the others there was silence
 for a time and then the leader spoke
 again

    miss holland and mr engle are in
 our hands unless you release the priest
 and come into the passage immediately
 they shall die 

    i do not believe you the captain
 said

    you do not hear any more firing on
 deck do you i say they have been con-
 quered and are in our power will you
 -come out

    no

    then your friends shall lose their
 lives

    very well the captain replied

    you still doubt that they are in our
 hands ill convince you thespokes-
 man said

   he gave a command in his native
 tongue and the captain whispered to me
 that he had told some of the men to
 bring my uncle and ruth plolland to the
 passage it was true then  they had
 been taken

   the captain seized the priest again and
 put his revolver at the mans head to
 prevent him crying out then we bound
 him with ropes and gagged him and car-
 ried him up the flight of steps and laid
 him across the aitus great wide lap he
 made a peculiar noise in his throat

    he is begging the aitu to save him
 the captain said

    what are we going to do i asked

   i did not relish the idea of my uncle
 and pretty ruth holland being slain be-
 cause of the captains stubbornness

    keep your eyes open and follow
 me the captain said

   we went to the top of the flight of
 steps crawled around the narrow ledge

of the pedestal upon which the aitu sat
and dropped down behind in the dark-
ness then i saw that there was a hol-
low space beneath the steps and that
from the front of it we could peer out
and see the entire interior of the cabin
between the aitu and the door it was
a small space but large enough to fire
through and the steps served as a for-
midable barricade

   wait and make no noise the cap-
tain said

  in a short time there were steps in the
passage and the words of the spokesman
came to us again

   will you come out he cried

  we did not answer  i have your
friends here to convince you that i have
not been speaking untruly he went on
 they shall speak to you

  we heard him command my uncle to
speak and there was no answer my
uncle was not the man to give himself
readily to the work of a decoy

  you speak to them woman we
heard the spokesman say

  still no voice came to us then one
of them must have seized her in an effort
to make her cry out for we heard her
scream and it cut into our hearts like a
knife and at the same time we heard
my uncles cry of rage the sound of
quick fighting of blows the door was
burst open and the mass of fighting
twisting men streamed into the temple-
room

  dont fire you may kill your un-
cle   the captain whispered

  some one brought a light and held it
high showing the scene of combat ruth
had run to the bottom of the steps and
was standing there watching the fray
sobbing in the center of the room my
uncle fought like a madman with the fa-
natics having some advantage because of
the smallness of the room

  but he was conquered in time and
held against the wall  seize the wom-
an the spokesman commanded  now
get the others

  two of them seized ruth and placed
her against the wall beside uncle dick

  where are the others master one
of the men asked in his tongue and the
captain translated it to me

   they are here find them was the
answer


the railroad mans magazine

  we heard some of them start up the
steps heard their cries as they discovered
the priest bound and gagged the
spokesman ran up to them and fell back
with them too for none of them dared
touch the aitu he sent one of the men
for welch

  welch was not long in coming

  what is it he asked

  the spokesman explained quickly
none may touch the aitu save you
master he said  we are not priests
welch made his way up the steps and
helped the priest down and unbound him
and took the gag from his mouth we
heard the priest jabbering

  he says the man and the boy went
beneath the aitu welch told the spokes-
man

   then we have them in a trap

   get them out welch ordered
 when you have them see that all four
are placed in separate cabins under a
strong guard vve must have no more
nonsenseuntil we reach the island
welch went across the cabin and
stopped in front of ruth holland and
uncle dick

    i promise you he said to my uncle
 that youll have a short time to live
when we get to the island

    perhaps my uncle said

    and i promise you he said to ruth
 that ill not forget your part in this
affair and that youll be made to suffer
for it

  uncle dick struggled to reach him
but the men held him back then the
captain and i had our own business to
attend to for the men were trying to
reach us from behind we opened fire
upon them one dropped down badly
wounded and the captain secured his
revolver and filled it with cartridges and
held it ready

   we cannot get to them master
they reported  they can kill us one
by one

   welch turned toward the aitu

    captain hawson he cried  unless
you and the boy come out and give your-
selves up ill take matters in my own
hands here and forget that these friends
of yours are entitled to courtesy

  the captain made no answer welch
bade the men carry ruth to the other

to be c

end of the cabin and then he had uncle
dick placed with his back against the
door

    ill give you one minute he cried

   you dare not kill a man in the pres-
ence of the aitu the captain replied

   i can kill him in the passage welch
answered

  he motioned the men to take uncle
dick outside ruth gave a scream and
tried to get to him but they would not
permit her

  will you come out welch cried
again

   yes the captain answered

  again he made me follow close behind
him and be on my guard we backed
out from beneath the steps and with
difficulty reached the ledge of the pedes-
tal then we crept around the aitu

   they were touching the aitu the
spokesman cried

  and as he spoke the captain opened fire
with both revolvers shouting into the
midst of them sending a hail of bullets
down the steps

   shoot roland   he screamed to me

  i joined in the fray the men burst
out the door fleeing welch and the
spokesman were gone we dashed down
the steps where ruth holland was lean-
ing against the wall almost at the point
of swooning

  the captain did not stop there but
ran to the door filling his revolvers as
he did so his continual firing unnerved
the men for they did not know we had
extra ammunition

  they were fleeing up the passage to-
ward the companionway we ran after
them keeping up the firing they fired
some shots in reply but none of them
took effect

  when the last one had gone on deck
we ran back again and got ruth and the
captain led us forward the way we had
gone that other time and so to the deck
there were men forward but when we
emerged and began firing at them they
ran aft quickly

  it was only the work of a minute to
get to our old position of security near
the bowsprit but there were only three
of us safe and secure

  uncle dick was in the hands of the

signaling without semaphores

by arno dosch

speed demands safety just as certainly as darkness demands light the
semaphore with all its various means of operation has done yeoman
service in this direction but something even more nearly perfect is
needed to meet modern conditions the visible signal on the track will some
day give way to the visible and audible signal in the cab with its accom-
paniment of the automatic stop this article describes the beginning of the
revolution read it some day it will be history

how an engineer will get his signals in the cab be automatically
controlled and be able to telephone all by
one third rail

  all the advantages of the automatic
  block in preventing collisions and goes
  a step further by stopping the train if
  the engineer does not heed the signal
  the fact that its method of cab signal-
  ing is simple as well as certain is also
  worthy of comment

first in england

    up to the time lacroix appeared with
  his device the most advanced form of
  signaling included only cab signaling
  and the automatic stop this combina-
  tion has been used moreover only on
  a few miles of road in england and is
  not thoroughly established as yet the
  difficulties encountered have been chiefly
  with the weather conditions necessitating
  the use of steam heat to melt the ice and
  snow at the points of contact between
  the engine and the signal arrangements
  on the track

    with lacroixs system a third rail is
  used and there is only such inconvenience
  as is caused by ice on a third rail any-
  where and that is not too great to obviate
  as shown by the success of third-rail sys-
  tems in the open country

    the telephone in the cab is entirely


telephone on the train
connecting with distant
cities so that a traveler
can conduct business
from a speeding coach
as if in his own office is
one of the striking features of a three
in one invention which fred lacroix
a young railroad man of twenty-four
has just placed in successful operation
on twelve miles of the erie railroad
in new jersey the two other parts to
the combination are a cab signaling sys-
tem and an automatic stop and the whole
proved its efficiency before half the signal
engineers and many financiers of new
york

  the inventor is staking his success
on the practical working of the safety
appliances but the appeal to the gen-
eral imagination is in the telephone for
though the public at large does not know
when it travels whether the road is au-
tomatically controlled or operated by
hand signals it can see a telephone and
feel a thrill of wonder when it is pos-
sible to sit in a car and talk with some
one a thousand miles away while the
train is whirling over the country

  as to safety lacroixs system has


the railroad mans magazine

new in signaling and has immediately
commended itself as a time saver it
provides a quick and direct means of
communication between engineer and op-
erator and permits the issuing of orders
to trains on the move at a distance from a
station

stopped from outside

  a light third rail does the work it
conveys the signals applies the brakes
when necessary and acts as a telephone
wire the mechanism is on the engine
where it is brought into the roundhouse
for inspection and all that can get out
of order along  the track is the track
circuit containing a battery and a track
relay if anything should happen to
these the train will be brought to a full
stop

  the engineer receives his information
as to the condition of the track ahead
from a green light which shows in his
cab as long as the right of way is clear
directly under it is an electromagnet
which derives its magnetic powers from a
shunt-wound dynamo driven by steam
pressure from the engine when it has
its full energy it is sufficiently power-
ful to hold up a heavy iron arm which
when in contact with the magnet does
not affect the air-brake valve

  if anything happens to the current
so that the magnet loses its power the
heavy iron arm falls opening the valve
and setting every brake in the train
and as the air escapes it passes through
a whistle which it blows in warning as
the current also supplies the light it goes
out simultaneously with the dropping of
the arm

  in the same circuit with the light and
the magnet is a shoe of steel brushes
made to scrape the third rail and com-
municate an electric current to its sur-
face as long as the third rail is in a
closed track circuit not broken by the
presence of another train the current
which is local to the engine flows out
through the third rail making a com-
plete circuit of the track wires and re-
turning through the wheels and body
of the engine

  if there is another train on the track
and the circuit is not closed the engine
circuit is abruptly broken by the same

opening in the track circuit which inter-
rupted the track current the magnet
loses its power the arm drops the brakes
are set and the train stops

  the whole mechanism of the signal
system in the engine is so constructed
as to respond promptly to the indica-
tions it receives from the third rail to
make it effective it is merely necessary
to have the track circuit closed if the
track is clear and open if it is occupied

  in doing this the principles of the
ordinary automatic block system are ap-
plied the wiring is different in order
to bring the third rail into the track cir-
cuit but there is no essential change for
this as for all automatic sems the
track is divided into blocks or sections
each of which is entirely separated from
the rest for signaling purposes

failure made safe

  a current of electricity generated at
one end passes down a rail to the other
where it goes through a relay contain-
ing an electromagnet which must remain
energized in order to keep the circuit
closed in other automatic systems the
current then passes to the other rail and
returns to the battery but in the la-
croix system a slightly more complicated
arrangement is necessary in order to per-
mit it to pass through the short sec-
tions of third rail at both ends of the
track and include them within the block
in both the track circuit depends upon
the magnet in the relay remaining ener-
gized but this it will only do while the
full current is passing through it

  as soon as an engine runs into the
block the wheels and axles form a short
path for the electricity and only a small
amount of it passes through the relay
not enough to hold the armature and
keep the circuit closed

points of difference

  on the ordinary automatic system the
opening of thecircuit whether from the
presence of a train a broken rail or a
landslide sends the signal on the sema-
phore to danger the working of the
lacroix system is quite different

  when a block is occujtied or in trouble
the approaching train first learns of it
signaling without semaphores



when the shoe strikes the third rail at
the end of the block previous to that
time while the-train was passing over a
clear track whenever the shoe struck a
section of the third rail the engine cur-
rent passed out through it to the track
circuit then through the track relay
which was closed back to the track and
home through the wheels and body of the
engine

  but as soon as it strikes a block where
the track current has been short-circuited
by the presence of a train or by other
trouble the current cannot make a com-
plete run through the track circuit on
account of the opening in the relay
caused by the lack of power in the
magnet

improvements to come

  the action is instantaneous the cur-
rent does not- leap from the shoe to
the third rail because it cannot return
the effect is to break the circuit in the
engine which results in extinguishing
the green light setting the brakes and
blowing the whistle

  each block is connected with the
third-rail sections at both ends of the
block so that trains can never approach
each other nearer than the length of
the block plus the lengths of the two
third-rail sections

  on single tracks such as the erie
branch on which it has been installed
the blocks overlap both ways so that
trains will not collide head on at the
end of a block at public demonstra-
tions it has been shown that head-on col-
lisions could not happen

  two engines-racing toward each other
with the throttles wide open and the en-
gineers leaning from the cab windows
were stopped at the ends of a block
which they both approached from oppo-
site sides as soon as each struck the
third-rail section the air-brakes were
set and both engines were brought to a
standstill within a few hundred feet al-
though the engines were still puffing
away with the throttles wide open

  the entire possibilities of the inven-
tion are not shown as yet because the
third rails are not continuous the sec-
tions are only long enough to give the
air-brakes a chance to stop the train

before the brushes have passed off which
is five hundred feet  the erie while
the train is passing from one third-rail
section to another it is entirely cut off
from communication

  there is however nothing to hinder
the third rails from being continuous
with only short breaks between blocks
and it will be a necessity if the telepho-
ning possibilities are used

  there is at present no provision giving
the engineer warning of the danger
ahead until suddenly the air-brakes are
opened and the train is brought to a
stop by an emergency measure this
can be remedied however by more ex-
tensive wiring and the use of distant
signals not unlike those in the automatic
semaphore system

  through them the engineer is in-
formed several blocks in advance of the
condition of the blocks he is approach-
ing at present the same electric cur-
rent which operates the signals also ap-
plies the brakes and before he can grasp
the throttle the train is being stopped
automatically the amount of jarring the
train -receives depending  the brakes

a switch for telephone

  there is as yet only one current gen-
erated in the engine and this must be
used for both the signaling apparatus
and the telephone obviously it can-
not be used for both at once this is
recognized by the inventor and he has
prepared a switch to be thrown whenever
the telephone is in use but this en-
tails the consequence that while the tele-
phone is in operation the signaling sys-
tem is dead to be running blindly ahead
witll  signals to guide would be
suicide as even the automatic stop is
out of commission

  a single current is feasible however
if the telephone is to be used for sig-
naling purposes only as the telephone
is only called into requisition when an
engineer receives information as to the
track but when it becomes a conve-
nience for travelers the telephone will
need a current all to itself this can
be taken care of by providing an al-
ternate current which can be used over
the same rails and wires without in-
terfering
 a pink-tea bo

by charles battell loomis

something might have happened if they hadnt
put on the binders while he was cutting the fat

h	yes uncle jabez is the
  most romantic of men
  why surely ive told you
  of the time that he put a
  new piano in stella wyn-
  graves hen-house as a
  wedding-present to her 

  i assured mrs dorkins that that par-
ticular manifestation of her uncle
jabezs ultra romanticism had never be-
fore been told me

   why yes you see stella and her
husband had gone into the poultry busi-
ness just after they married and she
had given up her
music uncle ja-
bez hadnt given her
any wedding - pres-
ent and she felt a
little hurt but one
night when she went
out to the hen-house
to lock up she found
in the big scratching
pen a brand - new
piano with the legs
lying beside it and
a card  from un-
cle tabe 

   i should think
that it might have
scratched the piano
somewhat

  it did and it
gave them no end of
trouble to get it into
the house but that
was uncle jabezs
romantic way and
so i say i never
know what hes go-
ing to do next and

now that weve heard hes- at last struck
it rich out in the klondike theres no tell-
ing how hell come back or when hell
turn up

   weve always been friendly with him
and we sort of hope that if he does come
back east hell take a fancy to marietta
ethella and give her a musical edu-
cation

  i was occupying a room and board-
ing with the dorkinses while pursuing
my medical studies they did not keep
a boarding-house but took me in because
my father and mr dorkins had been boys
together and mrs
dorkins thought it
 so romantic  for
me the second gen-
eration to be in the
way of having kind-
nesses s h o w n me
just because my
father and lester
dorkins had learned
swimming in the

hole

  mrs iolanthe
dorkins had a nose
for the romantic
that i have never
seen excelled her
own marriage to mr
dorkins was in the
highest degree ro-
mantic because she
had gone to buy a
pair of shoes in the
store where mr
dorkins was a clerk
and he had had the
hardihood to tell her

jgl

quite a graft my bov

a pink-tea 



she pinched her feet she had admired his
manliness in telling her what she con-
fessed was the truth and she had ordered
the next size larger and had fallen in love
with him at the same time

  mr dorkins had a vein of the roman-
tic in him which took the form of ad-
miring his wifes appreciation of things
removed from lifes humdrum and mari-
etta ethella lived in a dream of ro-
mance where every passer-by was a
potential prince and the grocers boy was
a kidnaped crown prince of the house
of ruritania

  knowing them as i did and being of
an age to enjoy a bit of practical joking
i set to work to devise some scheme by
which i could provide a little innocent
pleasure for myself and a bit of mys-
tification for them

  it was not long before  had decided
on a plan rich in promise i would get
some tramp to play the returned uncle
he should make a fat thing out of it in
the way of rich food and cigars and
when all was over i would confess my
complicity in the affair pay all damages
and take the whole family to some  ru-
pert of hentzau  sort of a play

   it so fell out that the following sat-
urday lent itself to my plan quite as if
the day had been prepared for me mr
dorkins being detained at home by a
slight cold i having the whole day free
and mrs dorkins beginning to wonder
when uncle jabez would return to his
home in the east

  i had kept him to the front as a
topic of conversation and had brought
out recitals of his many  romantic 
actions and the time was ripe for the
entry of jabez patchen romanticist

  the suburban villa of the dorkinses
covered a half acre and was mostly lawn
and old-fashioned  romantic  flowers
with one peach-tree which mrs dorkins
treasured as the apple of her eye because
the pit from which it sprang had been
given to her by a favorite nephew who
died next day of indigestion brought on
by eating the peach which was not fully
ripe

   this tree had never borne fruit before
but now was loaded with morris whites
which promised to be delicious when they
should have become ripe

   the house itself was one of the swiss

chalet order for obvious reasons and
while the furniture was not costly nor
the decorations rich the amount of bric-
a-brac with romantic associations fes-
tooned around it was remarkable knick-
knacks from mary lands fairly littered
center-table piano mantel and writing-
desk in the old-fashioned parlor

  it was to this home that i purposed
leading some fun-loving tramp who was
at the same time honest and that is why
i set out right after breakfast to search
for him

  mrs dorkins was preparing to do up
plums mr dorkins was nursing his cold
in a red wrapper covered with white roses
a gift from his wife and marietta
ethella was in a hammock on the ve-
randa reading  how prince florizel
came to his own

  a walk of half a dozen blocks brought
me on a tramp but he was so villainous
looking so destitute of any hint of re-
finement that i passed him by but two
blocks farther on i caught sight of a
trampish fellow looking at a map in the
window of a little real-estate office
perched on a knoll that commanded a view
of  highly improved  property

  the fellow wore a frock coat whose
better days must have been coeval with
the closing years of the civil war and
his hat looked older yet he had a red
handkerchief in place of a collar and his
shoes had not at any time been mates

  his trousers had surely first been worn
at an afternoon tea for they were of a
light material and of what had once
been a fashionable cut but they were
too tight for the sturdy legs that were
now within them

  here was the tramp i wanted-if
he had a sense of humor i hailed him
 good morning quite a boom in real
estate isnt there  

   yes said he turning and looking
at me with an insolent but whimsical
eye  i was thinkin of buyin a lot or
two an makin it over into a restricted
park

  mrs dorkins would have believed his
statement but i was delighted at his
chaffing power a tip or two and he
would play the part to perfection

  he looked to be about forty-five his
beard grizzled and wiry had been al-
lowed to seek the outer air for five days


the railroad mans magazine

at least and his hair had not known
the caressing touch of a comb in many
a day his hands were fairly clean and
he did not look like a drinking man
 made to order

   im sorry i cant sell you a block
said i  but i got rid of my last holding
a few days ago but say id like to have
a little talk with you if you have time
he rubbed his musical beard knotted
his eyebrows and said   have an ap-
pointment with a capitalist but it will
keep

  then without telling him who he was
supposed to be impersonating i told him
what i wanted him to do to make him-
self perfectly at home if mrs dor-
kins should invite him in and to throw
himself on her hospitality fervidly

  he hesitated perhaps he was think-
ing of parlor carpets and his rough shoes

 he gave me a keen half-suspicious look
 then i explained that i was a medical
 student bent on having some fun with
 friends of mine showed him a

good

dvitlopi

compjiwv

i was thinkin of buyin a lot or two

five-dollar bill that should be his if he
played his part well cautioned him
against any malicious mischief and
pausing for his reply got a poke in the
shoulder that nearly toppled me over
as with a gusty laugh he said  you
have picked a winner doc-what  

    good just be easy and natural you
know theyre a little bit dotty on
tramps plelp yourself to cigars-ill
make it good to them afterward you
understand-

    i dont giye a whoop in ohio wheth-
er you do or not but im the man for
the round trip and i want to say right
now that it appeals to me

  here he fetched me a good-humored
slap in the ribs that brought me to
the verge of the gutter and i had to
ask him to restrain his exuberance

  but i liked my tramp there was
no harvard reserve about him he
was human

   i explained to him that my friends
were long on romanticism and short
im humor and that  felt a little
good-natured practical joke at their
expense was perfectly legitimate

    yes and mild for a medical stu-
dent he said

   well ill hurry back to the
house and you come on in about half
an hour

   i was turning away when he said
 say were is this joint 

  to be sure i gave him clear
directions and went on my way re-
turning by another street so that
dork ins would not connect me with
the advent of the tramp

   i had been at the house a little
over half an hour before my tramp
appeared and he seemed about to
pass the house looking beyond as if
he had misunderstood my instruc-
tions

  i coughed significantly and he
looked up shrugged his shoulders
and shambled around to the side
gate mrs doxkins has what she
calls romantic palings enclosing the
place- as they used to be in the
old story books
a pink tea bo



  in a few moments i heard a whisper-
ed call in the hall  father marietta
ethella mr tompkins and i knew
that the curtain had risen

  marietta efhella tumbled out of the
hammock dropping the book i rose
from the rustic chair and mr dorkins
came down from his room in his fancy
wrapper

  oh said mrs dorkins breathing
heavily  theres a tramp in the kitchen
and while im not sure i can almost
was reminded of your uncle he looked
test us what shall i do

   did he just come down the side
street   i asked

   yes-

   why the minute i saw that man i
was reminded of your uncle he looked
sort of amateur theatrical ill bet a
hat he is

   just dress him up in your sunday
clothes mrs dorkins kill a fatted calf
or two and give him the time of his
life open a can of sardines and a keg
of beer and an oyster or two you wont
regret it

  she bit beautifully and if she had any
doubts of her uncles identity they were
now removed we all went into the
kitchen and on the way in i was sud-
denly inspired

  the tramp a born actor was stand-
ing in a very humble attitude drinking
a glass of milk which mrs dorkins had
poured out for him

  his back was to us but his pose was
one to win sympathy for he reminded
one of a peasant of the millet variety-
down-trodden and cloddish

  the world had been hard on the poor
fellow and i gave the dorkinss credit
for a feeling of real sympathy for tramps
in general-their very wanderings must
appeal to the good lady as somewhat  ro-
mantic

  my inspiration was to make it easier
for the dorkinses to do a rather unusual
thing by suggesting it to them on the
plea of the obligations of universal
brotherhood

   hallo my poor fellow said i
 arent you the man i was talking to
down the street a while ago

youre a beast thats

  what you are  




the railroad mans magazine

  lie turned his face lighted up and he
said in broken tones  thank you kind-
ly sir yes i am you said the first kin
words id heard in a week if all the
world was like you-

  i held up my hand to stop his flow
of praise and said  mrs dorkins here
is a man and a brother he is as good
as we are but hes never had a chance
why not let him have one

  mrs dorkins gave me a grateful look
i was making her action natural  why
not indeed  said she and ill do her the
justice to say that i think she was sin-
cere and perhaps forgot for a moment
that she supposed that this preposterous
looking fellow with the insolent eyes was
really her uncle

  as for me one can imagine my joy
i foresaw to what lengths this senti-
mental couple would go to make it easy
for this modern kit sly

   wont you have something moreto
eat asked mrs dorkins

  with what  considered a touch of
genius the fellow said no thanks
i had something to eat bright an early
an ony for walkin so far i wouldn
need this im not a great eater

  he felt that such sincerity on his part
would appeal to this kindly lady she
felt that  uncle  was acting his part
well and i felt that he was in his way
an artist

  while mr dorkins went up-stairs to
see if he could find a suit of clothes that
would do for the poor fellow and mrs
dorkins returned for the time being to
her plums marietta ethella showed the
tramp into the parlor and suffered him
to pat her head in a fatherly fashion
that made my gorge rise

  i was glad to see her leave him and go
out to her book i was also astonished
to see him slyly slip a little silver orna-
ment into his tail pocket i saw this
through the crack of the door and has-
tened into the parlor

  -ie stepped over to a box of cigars
and transferred at least thirty to his
breast pocket winking at me and saying
quite a graft my boy i owe you
something for this these folks are soft
enough for cushions heres where i
lay down on em for all im worth

  i did not mind the cigars but the
silver trinket was one that mrs dorkins

had obtained in one of her romantic
ways and i knew it was endeared to her
by associations so i said

   cigars are all right but i didnt
mean you to help yourself to bric-a-brac
this with a significant glance at his tail
pocket

  he laughed impudently  graft is
graft young feller and when i play a
game i go the whole hog

  as he spoke he went to the mantel
and helped himself to two silver candle-
sticks which his capacious pockets con-
cealed in short order

  quite forgetting that i had fostered
mrs dorkinss idea that this man was
her uncle i went out to the kitchen and
said  mrs dorkins youd better call
your husband and show this man to the
door hes a thief hes helping him-
self to bric-a-brac

  she laughed a silvery laugh  why
not said she the dear soul you
leave him alone when it comes time
for him to disclose his identity he will
take all those things out of his pockets
and well have a good laugh over it

   but said i  he isnt your uncle
she looked at me coldly  i dont
know what you mean

  i didnt know what i meant myself
i didnt know what i could have meant
to bring a disgusting old rounder into
a respectable house and give him a
chance to loot the place

  of course id have to make good and
id rather make good than confess to
these kindly people that i had put up
a senseless job on them it didnt look
funny to me any longer

  i went back into the parlor the
tramp was not there a little silver
traveling clock was also missing

  i hurried out onto the veranda and
saw to my horror the tramp fondling
the hair of the innocent child who sup-
posing it was her great-urcle let him
do it although  could see she shrank
from the greasy coat

   come here  said i in peremptory
tones and with mock contrition he lum-
bered up to me

   arent you ashamed of yourself 
 shame died in me in me third year
young feller i regretted the loss but i
didn go into mournin

  his pockets were positively bulging
a pink-tea bo



and every bulge meant several dollars
out of my pocket unless  could get him
to disgorge

   nice location this he said look-
ing out over the rolling country to a
branch of the hackensack in the dis-
tance  and early peaches too say
cull whats the matter with us havin
some fruit fruit in the mornin-whats
the sayin

   then dont butt in lorenzo the
lady of the house  - he broke into a
laugh- the lady of the house is doin
up plums how can i show her me
gratitude wy i can pick her peaches
for her to do up unripe for eatin--
just right for cannin

  he started down the steps that led
to the garden marietta said  unc-er-
mr man please dont pick those

we all went into the kitchen

   you leave that fruit alone i
growled  it isnt ripe and mrs dor-
kins sets great store by it

  u when a feller tramps as i do said
he blandly  his digestion laughs at a
little thing like unripe fruit i like
peaches and im gon to help myself
have some flossy

   no thank you sir she said-trying
to control a tendency to giggle

  will you keep out  asked earn-
estly

   do you own this fruitery said he
mimicking my tones

   no

     r r

peaches my mama is keeping them for
papas birthday week after next

   flossy- said the horrible man
 what if some one broke in here in the
night and stole those peaches-then where
would your pas birthday treat be i
will pick them now and they can be made
into brandied peaches for his birthday
lightly lie ran down the steps and
over to the tree with its bushels of fruit
as for me i went into the house and
called mr dorkins but he was up in
the attic and did not answer i went to
the kitchen mrs dorkins was not there
but i heard her in the cellar


the railroad mans magazine

  down to the cellar i went and said to
her  mrs dorkins that man is out pick-
ing your peaches

  she shook her head calmly  uncle
tabez wouldnt do that even in joke

   but how do you know this is uncle 
 because he acts like him-because
his disguise is so splendid its just the
way he would act and hed be sure to
make up so that i couldnt see any re-
semblance to him

  i left her hurriedly and ran out of
doors determined to appeal to the tramps
finer feelings

  but he had none when i reached
him he had actually half stripped the
tree putting the peaches into a basket
he had found there by cursed luck

   look here youre a beast thats what
you are  youre a vandal what kind
of return is this for these people

  he looked -at me insolently  the
glass of milk and the cigars-not for-
gettin the bric-a-brac

  as he spoke he went on picking the
morris whites - peaches that were the
apples of mrs dorkinss eyes suddenly
i heard a hoarse laugh at mr dorkinss
bedroom window we looked up he
was watching us and yet thanks to his
fatuous belief in the identity of this
tramp with his wifes uncle he was mere-
ly amused at this act of rapine

  i yelled up to him filled with shame
and contrition and ready to eat dust in
my humiliation  mr dorkins i must
apologize to you for this hold me per-
sonally responsible i put up a joke on
you this man is a tramp

   yes he looks the part but wheezed
mr dorkins his sore throat preventing
fuller tones  i think that he will ad-
mit that he is my good wifes uncle and
he knows that when he comes back were
only too glad to let him do what he wants
with our things i cant find that suit
uncle jabez but now that the cats out
of the bag it doesnt matter

  great scott said i running un-
der the bedroom window  i tell you
that this fellow is my tramp i hired

him to come here and take all that was
coming to him and hes turned out a
thief hell go to jail for this 

  the noise of my voice had brought
mrs dorkins out and marietta ethella
had again dropped her book and was-
leaning over the veranda-rail all eyes

  the tramp sunk his teeth into a morris
white and then ejected the unripe fiber
on the ground lie also gave the basket
a kick beast

  but nothing would shake the faith of
these people in the man they had be-
friended and i saw that i would have
to pretend to give up and go away after
which i would telephone for an officer

  i felt sure the fellow had audacity
enough to stay there over at least one
meal perhaps he would again fawn over
that innocent if sentimental child

  suddenly the fellow straightened him-
self threw his hat on the path ran his
hands through his tangled hair a few
times reducing it to order in a remark-
able manner then in tones that be-
spoke gentility he said

   young man you would have had
more fun if you had picked out a real
tramp but he couldnt have had half as
much fun with you as ive had

  he took out of his pocket a clock a
paper-cutter and a candlestick

   these go back where they belong
said lie  also the rest of the things i
picked up the peaches unfortunately
i cant restore but ill set out a young
orchard this fall if iolanthe will let me

    told you young manyoud picked
a winner and you have i won enough
the last year in the klondike to make all
of us happy-and if youll forgive me
ill let you come in

  i looked at the dorkinses mrs dor-
kins was hugging herself at the roman-
ticism of the morning mr dorkins was
looking ruefully at the peaches

  from a waistcoat pocket the tramp
took a card-case out of which he ex-
tracted a card which he handed to me
it read jabez patchen

  the joke was on me

even a yard engine needs steam dont forget the grub-bucket-

 old-timer tales

 with the first vanderbilt

by c p greneker

the old-timers are the most appealing the most romantic the most
interesting section of the railroad community men who have helped
to make history which we are living upon will always have a charm
for the popular mind that cannot be described and is held by no other set of
men here we are presenting the first of a series of old-timer tales which
we feel pretty sure will be one of the hits of our career turn to the editorial
carpet and see what else we have to say about this feature

     there is still alive and active a man who was in the employ of the late
commodore vanderbilts first railroad he was a railroad man even before
the famous commodore came on the scene and for four years he was one of
the magnates right-hand men

     the stories that he tells of the old days are not tragic nor are they of
great historical value there is not much mystery or romance concealed in
them but they do show one thing that is sometimes too much neglected in
the little stories of the great-the human side of the founders and guardians
of great industries and colossal fortunes their faults and virtues that make
them kin to the rest of us

     it is for the sake of the light that they shed on the purely human quali-
ties of the first vanderbilt that these stories are related

the old freight-agent on the harlem tells stories of the early days
when commodore vanderbilt was rising to power
in the railroad world

ing was comparatively new to him he
had just got hold of the harlem road
but he had a faculty of asking questions
and it was with this object in view that
he sent for me to discuss freight-rates

   i was ushered into his bedroom the
old commodore pulled himself up and
began firing queries at me

    what does it cost to ship a ton of
coal from here to white plains he
asked pointing his index finger first to
the right and then to the left he had
a habit of doing that when he talked

was ten oclock of a sunday
morning in june s the
place was the bedroom of com
modore vanderbilt the new
president of the harlem rail-
road the speakers were com-
modore vanderbilt still in bed and i
d barton his first freight-agent for-
merly a harlem railroad conductor the
story is told in bartons words

   tlie commodore had a habit of lying
in bed late sundays although he was an
early riser week-day mornings railroad-


the railroad mans magazine

   i told him

  umph huh he sort of groaned
and after a pause  and how much for
a horse and buggy

   again  gave him the amount

  there was another pause finally
 and how much fer a barrel of flour to
white plains   i told him the rate
without hesitation the old commodore
now in a sitting posture said gruffly

    put your rates down on flour and
oal poor people use those things but
anybody that can afford to have a horse
and buggy can afford to pay high freight-
rates put your rate up on horses and
buggies

   that ended the  freight meeting 
commented barton  and the next day i
had a new tariff when i read of this
teapot tempest which is being raised over
rate legislation i often wish that the old
commodore with his common sense were
here to spread oil on the troubled waters
horse sense is what he had and a heart
as big as this sofa

vanderbilts first pensioner

  we were seated on a plush-covered
divan of tremendous proportions in one
corner of which half reposed the figure
of the commodores first freight-agent a
man now seventy-six years of age who
has seen service on several roads as gen-
eral superintendent his last position
which was given up on account of ad-
vanced years was in charge of operation
of the brooklyn rapid transit

   yes he had the kindest disposition of
any man i ever knew continued the
veteran  one day we were standing
near the ticket window at the twenty-
sixth street station-that was at fourth
avenue-when a woman with four or five
children came up and asked for tickets to
chatham she lacked one dollar of hav-
ing enough money

   the commodore never missed any-
thing he overheard the womans con-
versation with the ticket - agent and
calling me aside told me to pay the dif-
ference and charge it to  profit and loss
before carrying out his wish i ventured
to ask the woman why she wanted so
many tickets and the cause of her finan-
cial embarrassment

   she replied that her husband could

not get work in new york or at least
i should say she began to tell me that
when the commodore who i thought was
some distance away broke in with

  what cant get work in new
york your husband must be a fine
specimen he thundered he had fol-
lowed me up to hear what i said

    no yure rivirince explained the
woman   it was this way and with
that she led up from around the comer
of the station a one-legged man who was
her husband  he wure run over by er
train on this very road the man
nodded as though to confirm his wifes
story

  when demanded the commodore
with some passion he had just taken
possession of the road

    some years ago answered the wom-
an  and he niver got a cint

    theji hell be my first pensioner
said the commodore  and he added
thoughtfully  i trust my last

   yes indeed commented barton
heaving a great sigh  those were great
days dick croker tammanys old boss
was a machinist in the harlem shops at
thirty-second street his brother george
drove a horse-car on the fourth avenue
line and another brother ed was an
engineer on the harlem

   in those days just after the commo-
dore got hold of the road his son w h
vanderbilt was farming over on staten
island-a regular country farmer-and
he used to sell hay to the harlem road
for the horses that pulled our trains
from tryon row

dropping mule-power

   i cant just recollect the year but
the commodore got tired of mule-power
through the tunnel and ordered me to
run the trains from twenty-sixth street
up with engines yes i was general
freight-agent at the time and i was also
assistant superintendent but for both jobs
i got onlyseventy-five dollars a month

    i did as i was told and soon the city
authorities were after us as all of the
property-owners objected to the smoke
and noise from the engines this tunnel
was the one under fourth avenue and
both sides of the avenue were lined with
fine dwellings
with the first vanderbilt



   the commodore defied the authori-
ties until at last a squad of policemen was
sent to capture any engine that went
through the tunnel pulling a train the
commodore saw to it that i was on that
engine there were about ten police-
men and they started for us at twenty-
sixth street  four or five were daring
enough to climb on the tender and i
tell you we gave them the ride of their
lives and a free bath from the tender
tank into the bargain when we reached
forty-second street there wasnt one of
them left to tell the tale

-i- at the end of the tunnel the com-
modore was waiting for us i jumped
off and the train went on presently the
police squad came charging through the
tunnel with an irish sergeant in com-
mand he was one of the four whom we
had first drenched and then discarded
he was a sorry spectacle

   there the commodore was in white
stove-pipe hat and long black frock coat
a most commanding figure he was at
the sight of him the policemen halted
before the sergeant had time to say any-
thing the commodore turned upon them
with

    what do you impertinent rascals
mean by trespassing in this tunnel 

    trespassing do ye call it  snorted
the irishman  a dum foine naime it be
for murther

   the remark so amused the commo-
dore that he laughed until i thought he
would burst the bedraggled appear-
ance of the drenched policemen helped
matters along and soon the sergeant
realizing how he had been worsted join-
ed in the laughter- the situation sud-
denly dawned upon the irishman he
walked up close to the commodore and
in a whispered tone said

    ye wont mintion it will ye yure 
honore-between two gintlemen

the question of salary

   the latter remark i thought would
result fatally with the commodore-he
laughed so long and heartily but  be-
tween two gintlemen enough had been
said and the incident was closed the
secret was not divulged

   i was saying i got seventy-live dol-
lars a month i was handed down as it

were when the commodore bought the
harlem road for i had served under five
presidents of the same company before
cornele-thats what we sometimes called
the commodore-got hold of it he
never thought to inquire as to my salary

   the road was making money-you
remember a year after the commodore
was elected president of the new york
central he declared a stock dividend of
eighty per cent-and one day while out
driving with him he asked somewhat
abruptly what salary are you getting
young man

    i told him  seventy-five dollars  as
meekly as i possibly could  more than
youre worth  was his curt reply but
at next pay-day i think it was less than
a week off i found that my salary had
been doubled

a ride with cornele

   i shall never forget this particular
ride i took with cornele i think it was
a sunday morning at any rate we were
going up to one hundred and third
street to look at the new stock-yards i
got in the buggy at twenty-sixth street
and before we started the commodore
says to me young man they tell me
that tunnel leaks

   i knew it only too well but i
wouldnt admit it so i thought by giv-
ing an evasive answer he would forget

    i think ill drive through and see
for myself said he

   i remonstrated with him not that i
cared so much about the leaks but on ac-
count of the danger of driving a blooded
pair and a light runabout through the
tunnel he appeared not to hear me

   whipping up his horses we started
bumping over the ties did he find any
leaks if you had known thecommo-
dore you wouldnt ask as i said the
leaks were there and he found them

   after emerging from the tunnel at
forty-second street the commodore
turned into fifth avenue it was then
a dirt road above forty-second street
and the thoroughfare was lined with
boulders he drovearound them so-reck-
lessly i feared that we would meet with
an accident but he simply laughed when
i told him to be careful they were very
fine horses that team and i compliment-


the railroad mans magazine

ed the commodore on owning such fine
stock

    by george  he replied  i
wouldnt swap them for the whole long
island railroad at that time i dont
know that the commodore was putting
too high a valuation on his horses

money in milk

   i asked barton to give me some of the
harlem freight - rates  we changed
them so often he replied  that i cant
remember a single rate it was a long
time ago you know our biggest traffic
however for a long time was the trans-
portation of cattle and milk

    in the early sixties the harlem road
handled as much as three thousand dol-
lars worth of milk-i mean in rates-
a day we charged i think a cent and
a half a quart and we collected every
nickel before the milk was loaded we
had agents for that purpose

    i believe it was the milk and cattle
business that attracted the commodore to
the harlem railroad i first met him
when i was a passenger conductor on the
harlem in  and  believe that the
trips he used to make on my train had a
great deal to do with his purchasing the
line

    he always drove to the station and
had me take the wheels from his buggy
and load it in the baggage-car then id
place chairs for him in the baggage end
of the coach thats the way he would
ride to chatham he always carried his
lunch and a bottle of cider with him

   after i had made my collection the
commodore would ply me with questions
about the harlem road how many gal-
lons of milk did we haul a day how
many engines had we were they good
did the farmers patronize the road  and
a hundred and one similar questions i
never realized what he was after until i
learned he had bought the road

  in my opinion the harlem railroad
-the new york and harlem its called
-is the greatest asset of the vanderbilt
fortune to-day it is the key to the new
york central situation while the van-
derbilts have sold thousands and thou-
sands of shares of new york central
stock they could even were they to dis-
pose of all their holdings still dominate

the new york central on account of the
harlem road

   it is the very necessary tail to the
dog and the new york central pays well
for the lease of the tail

   going back as far as  led me to ask
barton in what year he began railroading
he said that he became agent of the
harlem road at mott haven in  and
six months later resigned to take a freight
run on the same road russell sage he
told me was then running a general store
 up state  and frequently rode with
him

stealing a freight-train

    i recall back in the fifties he con-
tinued  when five hundred people seized
one of our trains and compelled the crew
to bring them to new york there was
a famous prize-fight at boston corners
one night-the place gets its name from
the fact that three states new york
connecticut and massachusetts meet
there-and we carried up the noisiest and
rowdiest lot of passengers i have ever
seen

    we felt very much relieved when we
put them off at boston corners and wired
headquarters not to stop the incoming
night express at that place the  sports 
had intended catching this train back to
the city

   when the fighters and sports found
themselves high and dry at the corners
with no place to sleep they marched on
millerton and after drinking all our
milk and roasting five or six pigs which
belonged to our agent they compelled the
crew of the millerton local to fire up

    there were five cars but the gang
determined to get revenge made the crew
couple on all of the freight-cars at mil-
lerton poor old john birchall was the
conductor it was nearly four oclock in
the morning when he finally got his train
made up and he brought those five hun-
dred people to the city without collecting
a cent

blowing them off

    it was at boston corners you know
that the treacherous blow hole was lo-
cated it was nothing more than a bre 
in the cliffs but the rocks were so situate
with the first vanderbilt



that the winch-used to blow through the
gap with terrible force they had a
saying that the winds from the three
states met at the  hole

    they evidently did one day in 
when tom hyers came along with a train
of sixcoaches as soon as the train got
opposite the  hole  the rush of wind
blew all the coaches into the river
everything left the track except the en-
gine it was a miracle that everybody
was not killed but i believe only one life
was lost

   hyers always swore that the only
thing that saved the engine from toppling
over was the fact that the engineer carried
a huge jack-knife one of the blades of
which he had magnetized by slipping it
in the rail joints	

    the most peculiar railroading in my
experience was out in ohio on the at-
lantic and great western railroad
which ran from meadville to salamanca
and thence to cleveland and cincinnati
it is now a part of the erie i was gen-
eral manager of the united states roll-
ing stock company an english concern
when general george b mcclellan the
father of new yorks present mayor was
president the general was also presi-
dent of the great western

   in  the general called me into
his office one morning and told me that
he wanted me in meadville next morning
to take charge of the great western
there was nothing to do but go

a three-gage road

    i found the road a six-foot gage and
to further add to my horror and burden
the connecting lines were either narrow
gage or standard this was the case all
through the mahoning valley there-
fore in order to handle traffic-we didnt
use the ramsey transfer-we had three
rails and every switch of course was
double  jinted

    the irish section-boss who after be-
ing warned about his verbose accident re-
ports wired after a derailment  off
agin on agin gone agin finnegin
must have been a switchman on the great
western at some time there were so
many derailments that the splintered and
broken ties made the track look like a
corduroy wagon-road

   i have seen a six-foot-gage engine
pulling twenty-five cars half of which
were of one gage and half of another
this of course required four couplings
for every car then on some stretches of
track where we had three gages i have
seen a narrow-gage engine hauling stand-
ard six-foot-gage and narrow-gage cars
imagine trying to switch a train made up
of different gage cars

    the most apt comparison i can think
of is the old drop hook link motion en-
gines when you pulled the throttle of
one of these engines you never knew
whether she was going ahead or back
so when one of these trains struck a
switch there was such a difference of
opinion between the cars that some would
go one way and some another

      -	held up by friends

    one day the division superintendent
at meadville got this wire from a freight
conductor who had tried to run his train
into a siding west of meadville  five
cars off on narrow-gage track  ten off on
six-foot eight off on standard unable
yet to determine location of engine what
shall i do   back went the wire

 sending ton of dynamite

   i had a funny experience one night
with general mcclellan we were
bound for cincinnati and our train was
held up about two oclock in the morn-
ing-i thought at first by train-robbers

 got a good scare

     little mac as the old  vets  called
the general dropped into meadville one
afternoon and told me to get my car
ready as he wanted to go west on number
three which left meadville at nine
oclock at night there was no one on
the car except the general myself and
the colored porter we talked until
about midnight and then turned in i
was riding forward and the general oc-
cupied a stateroom in the rear of the car

   suddenly  was awakened by some
one pounding on my door i demanded
to know the cause of the knocking and
the train conductor evidently agitated
as i could judge from his voice said

     were held up and they wont let
us proceed theyre on the engine and
iii front of us

     by the great boot  i yelled get


the railroad mans magazine

ting into my tilings  shoot em  shoot
em down 

     its not that at all explained the
conductor  theyre a lot of old soldiers
in uniforms and with banners flags and
torches who demand a speech from gen-
eral mcclellan

    this is certainly a pretty mess i
mused as soon as  had dressed  went
forward to explain that  little mac 
was undressed and in bed that didnt
make a particle of difference to the vet-
erans they had heard early in the
night that the general was on the regular
cincinnati express and their presence was
due to love for the war hero and more-
over they were there to stay finally i
told them that it would be impossible

    then youll spend the night here
shouted a dozen old fighters

   i realized that they meant it and
went back to arouse the general i must
confess he wasnt pleased at first but
after he got a glimpse of the great crowd
of soldiers and citizens-there must have
been four hundred-he relented when
he had dressed i ran up to the engine
and told the soldiers who were on the
track that if they would step aside i
would have the train pulled up until the
private car which was on the end of the
train came up to them

    go wan ye rebel  yelled a man
with a torch  ye cant trap us as aisy
as ye think weull go back to the caar
but a body-guarrd will stick to tlr en-
gine

early days on long island

   i had to submit to the arrangement
in spite of the implied treachery the
general made a brief speech from the rear
platform and at the conclusion of his re-
marks i signaled the conductor to go
ahead but we were again held up the
irishman and his companions who had
doubted my sincerity refused to let the
engineer start until he and his friends
had shaken hands with general mcclel-
lan

  barton told me that he had served on
the long island railroad at three differ-
ent times always as general superintend-

ent the first time was in  when
oliver sharlock was president again
in  he took the general superintend-
ency of the old north shore railroad
and in  when austin corbin got
control of the road barton was placed
in charge of operation

   when i first went to the long is-
land railroad under sharlock contin-
ued barton  the road ran from hunters
point now long island city to green-
port i spent a week walking over every
foot of the track and every step i took
i couldnt help thinking of old commo-
dore vanderbilts remark about swap-
ping his horses for the long island rail-
road

the lost rails

   i never in my life saw worse track
accidents were so frequent that no one
depended on the railroad and yet the
long island is one of the oldest steam
roads in this part of the country

   after i had finished my inspection
tour i surprised sharlock by announcing
the immediate need of twenty thousand
ties and ten tons of rails on hearing
my demand he all but expired

    then what in the name of heaven
has become of our rails he dramatic-
ally and excitedly cried the rails had
been in use since about 

    you cant prove it by me i replied

 ive been out on the line for nearly two
weeks and i havent found any rails

    then what are our trains running
on  he asked in an injured manner

    on the sod i answered

   and it was a fact the earth had
risen over the rails and had been packed
so firmly and so hard that the wheels of
the cars made grooves in the sod and
they were running on this more than on
the rails

   i say rails but i never saw them
until sharlock bought the ten toils i
wanted when i had laid the new rails
sharlock says to me

    well barton i give you the credit
for having built the first railroad on
long island what we had before was
a hole in the ground 

   the next old-timer tale will tell of the jarratt-palmer special which was a sensa-
tion in  when it made a record-run from new york to san francisco
 recent railroad patents

by forrest g smith

the vast network of railroad efficiency and railroad equipment has
been built up by eighty years of such
efforts as these

    we have decided to slightly change the form of our monthly article on railroad
patents and to add another feature for a long time we have been receiving queries from
readers seeking advice about patent procedure and heretofore mr smith has answered these
queries by mail in future we shall run these queries and the answers to them as an appendix to
the monthly article every reader who has a problem of this nature is welcome to the services
of the department and a letter addressed to mr forrest g smith or to the editor will re-
ceive attention as early as possible

torpedoes-ordinarily railroad tor-
pedoes are highly efficient as signals but in
rainy or snowy weather the explosive mix-
ture which they contain becomes damp even
after a few moments exposure so that the
proper signal will not be given an ex-
tremely simple but very effectual remedy
for this evil is shown in a patent no -
 november   issued to frank
dutcher of versailles pennsylvania mr
dutcher provides a torpedo in which the
explosive-containing portion is sealed with a
water-proof substance

j

convenient brake-it is now

customary for trainmen in setting the
brakes on a car or a train of cars while they
are at a standstill to climb onto the car
platform in order to set the brakes but a
device patented by henry c ostermann of
chicago illinois no  november 
 obviates this necessity when the car
or cars are at a standstill the device is
embodied in an ordinary brake-mast such
as now has mounted at its upper end the
usual hand-wheel but in this device the
wheel-mast is swiveled so that it may be
swung down to extend behind the car and
be turned by means of the wheel while

the brakeman is standing on the ground in
other words the brake may be applied 
any car whether the brakeman is standing
on the ground or is on the car

spring journal lid-spring

controlled journal-box lids have often
been suggested but nearly all of them pos-
sess the disadvantage of being liable to seat
improperly leaving a space for dust to enter
to prevent this thomas h symington of
baltimore maryland has patented no -
 november   a journal-box lid
which is held in place by means of a heavy
spring which while it is arranged in the
usual manner cooperates with a cam mem-
ber  the hinge of the box and lid so as
to guide the lid to its seat and insure a close
fit between the parts

automatic stop-an entirely
automatic system for controlling trains is
disclosed in patent no  november
  issued to william g daring of
pittsburgh pennsylvania his system is de-
signed to prevent the entrance of a train
into a block occupied by another train

  it is embodied in automatic means carried




the railroad mans magazine

by the engine or tender which is actuated
through the closing of a circuit through the
medium of contacts arranged beside the
tracks the system is so arranged that the
air-brakes will be applied on any train
entering a block occupied by another train
after stopping the train on which the mech-
anism is arranged the actuating device for
the brakes is automatically reset

lumber-loader-ordinarily
lumber is loaded into cars by the aid of a
man in the car a device shown in patent
no  november   however is-
sued to edgar l stocking of buffalo new
york makes it possible for lumber to be
loaded without this help

  the device consists merely of a bar struc-
ture which is so constructed as to be ar-
ranged within the doorway of any car and
which supports a roller which is of such
breadth that lumber may be readily shoved
over it and into the car the support for
the roller is moreover swiveled so that the
lumber may be guided into the car toward
either end and disposed according to the
wishes of the operator of the device



new rail process-as the or-
dinary form of rail is rolled the strata
of the steel in the tread of the rail is posi-
tioned in layers parallel to the strata in the
web of the rail in other words the grain
of the rail if it were of wood would run
the same in the head of the tread as in the
web of the rail

  as a result rails soon become worn in
their tread surfaces and have to be replaced
by new ones to overcome this disadvan-
tage norman randleman of knoxville
pennsylvania has devised a method of man-
ufacture which is simple in the extreme
but which will result in the rail manufac-
tured by the process having the grain of its
head run at right angles to the grain of its
web

  as a result the life of the rail is pro-
longed and it will not pee as does the ordi-
nary rail after a short period of use

rail-bender - a novel form of
rail-bending tool is disclosed in patent
no  november   issued to
tames r james of ridley park pennsyl-
vania usually such devices are not adjust-
able to every size of rail and are conse-
quently limited in their usefulness

  the device disclosed by mr james how-
ever includes a bracket member which is
adapted to be applied to a rail and has
mounted upon it an arm which is adjustable

so as to bring the rail engaging and bending
members into proper engagement with the
rail as a result a rail may be bent by
means of this device at any desired angle
regardless of its size

controlled headlight

-numerous devices have been proposed
for the purpose of keeping the headlights
of locomotives in alinement with the tracks
but such devices have usually included mech-
anism connected with the trucks of the car
to which they are applied

  a device patented no  november
  by silas w pomery of big run
pennsylvania discloses an extremely simple
idea which is adapted to this use and
which includes  mechanism of this char-
acter the device is embodied merely in a
reflector for the usual headlight which is
pivotally mounted and is controlled solely
by means of weights so arranged as to
direct the rays of light from the reflector to
the tracks regardless of curves and inclines

street-car doors-as pay-

as-you-enter cars are at present construct-
ed the conductors are exposed to the cold
or where the doors are so arranged as to
be normally closed to enclose the rear
platform they must be manually opened by
the conductor at each stop

  mr harold rowntree of chicago illi-
nois has conceived the idea of providing
means operable from the movement of a
crank-handle at the inner end of the bar
behind which the conductor stands for auto-
matically swinging the entrance door in-
wardly and the exit door outwardly the
patent disclosing this device no 
october   has been assigned to one
of the principal manufacturers of this class
of cars

grain-door escape-it is de-
sirable that grain-car doors be so con-
structed that they may be partly opened so
as to allow the escape of a greater or less
quantity of grain before the entire door is
opened or removed ordinarily a small
door is arranged in the main door for this
purpose but such doors permit the dis-
charge of grain in too great a volume-tind
over too large an area to be satisfactory

  richard r reaveley of fort william
canada has secured a patent no ss
november   on a car door of this type
consisting of three sections two of which
when arranged in closed position in the
door opening leave a v-shaped opening
which is closed by the third section this

i


recent railroad patents



latter section may be opened to a greater
or less degree as may be desired so as to
allow the discharge of a small stream of
grain through the v-shaped opening at the
narrow end thereof

a stronger frog-a railway

track frog naturally receives considerable
thrust which is usually transmitted to the
rails leading from the frog rails causing
abnormal creeping of the rails this creep-
ing is overcome by a means disclosed in
patent no  november   is-
sued to william h dotter and raphael s
hays of carlisle pennsylvania and as-
signed to a large switch-manufacturing con-
cern of pennsylvania

  the frog shown in this patent is formed
with pairs of spaced reinforcing ribs between
which seat the usual braces provided for
securing the frog to the ties not only do
the ribs reenforce the frog rails but they
also cooperate with the braces to hold the
frog against creeping

better rails-a novel process in
treating railway rails so as lo prevent peel-
ing and render them practically proof against
shocks and wear except after lengthy use
is disclosed in a patent no  novem-
ber   issued to fred h daniels of
worcester massachusetts in this method
the blanks are first heated to a high degree
and then suddenly cooled so as to impart a
very fine crystalline structure to them

  they are then heated again and cooled
gradually so as to eliminate internal strain
after which they are cold rolled so as to
lengthen and flatten the crystals throughout
the entire exterior surface by this method
a kind of fiber is formed at and near the
exterior surface of the rail rendering it
tenacious so to speak and calculated to ma-
terially prolong the life of the rail



hose-coupling-n u merous

automatic air and steam couplings have been
devised for railway cars but nearly all of
them have lacked the one thing which will
render their adoption really practicable that
is they nearly all are rigidly mounted so
that a slight difference in elevation between
the cars to be coupled will be liable to result

in leaks or imperfect engagement of the
couplings

  to obviate this disadvantage joseph v
robinson of salem oregon has patented
-no  october   a coupling
of this class which will be effectual whether
the cars to be coupled are in or out of direct
alinement as regards their couplings

  the coupling employed may be of the
ordinary form which includes centering
wings to bring the terminals of the pipes to
be coupled in mutual engagement but
whereas such devices have before been rig-
idly supported the heads of this coupling
are held in position solely by stout springs
which serve to support the same from the
main air and steam-supply pipes

  these springs will of course yield when
the heads upon two cars contact so as to
insure of proper mutual engagement

                                          through a sleeping countryside

under a moonless starlit sky

                                        where the whirling winds have died

                        from my place in the swelling foot-hills

                      far out toward the rim of night

                      i know that the mail is straining

                                               and feels the cool caressing breeze
                                               as the citys lights drop by

                        into the open country

                          with ever-increasing speed

song of the night mail

                     from my seat in the swelling foot-hills
                     i can hear a muffled throb

                     like the march of a distant army

                      or a restless seething mob

                                      i know that the mail is coming
                                      ere  see the light at the head

                                       for the muffled throb is the mighty wheels

                    then from the edge of darkness
                    comes a steady speck of light

                    the throb becomes a muffled roar
                    far out in the eastern night

flew the coop and hotfooted it to mexico where he had some esca-
pades which were so hot that a chile con carne factory would be an ice-house
in comparison

    it seems as if every railroad man wants to have a fling at mexico and
if the experiences of any who have emigrated there are at all like those of
mr herrs hero we dont wonder that its better to keep this side of the
gringo-belt

    our boomer has hustled back to his native heath-lie has gone home to
help father milk the cows and wean the pigs thus ends a brief but varied
railroad career we are not sorry having read about it-are you 

-gets his clearance for keeps

showing the marvelous independence of the stinger who thinks that
one hundred cents will buy the sun moon stars the
stellar spaces-and a few drinks

                             v

are forty men for every job and a card
isnt good for a look-in at a square meal
i went down there thinking i would catch
on as manager of the southwestern or
some other easy money but there was a
nothing-doing sign hanging over the en-
tire place

  i	went onto the g h and s a extra
board but you couldnt get a trip down
there for love nor money those fellows
get a job and never leave it until they are
ready for the soldiers home

  then i went to shuffling cars in the
yard the first string they cut off on me
when i was in the field ran down and
hit the rear end of a switch-engine put
the tank over the smokestack and it was
me for the time-check and out of the job
again a private in the great army of the
unemployed

  one week more and i was looking for

began in the octobcr  railroad mans magazine single copies  cents

                                      i

          id you ever notice how inde-
pendent a fellow gets when
he has a dollar in his
pocket he will rise up in
his dignity and tell a rail-
road to go to the under-
world  then hell fly the job apparently
in the belief that that one dollar will
buy the sun moon and stars when the
last penny is gone and he hasnt any-
thing in his pocket that will make a rat-
tle hes mighty glad of the chance to
fight the cinders  the head end and
lug chains in order to get back on the
pay-roll

  i flew the job on the in and out and
decided that i would quit railroading for
some other occupation a little less strenu-
ous i might have kept the resolve if i
hadnt drifted into el paso texas

  el paso is a wonderful town there
being a boomer brakeman



a hand-out looking hard with a magni-
fying-glass and there was still nothing
doing every one appeared to be on the
side or running light and i had to flag
the meal-stops until i got so thin that i
looked like the imported living skeleton
in a side-show

  then i began to cast longing glances
across the rio grande to the land of the
 quien sabe 

land of lead dollars

  mexico for me where the lead dollars
come easy and go twice as fast where
the last summers clothes are plenty good
enough and a sandal-foot peon is the only
one you have to look out for without
the price of the toll-bridge i got over
to juarez out-talked a conductor on a
south-bound drag and climbed aboard
bound some place i didnt know where
but content to feel that i was on my way

  i woke up in chihuahua a beautiful
village with a popula-
tion of two hundred	
thousand-counting the
dogs - but there was
nothing doing there
not even a free lunch

it was back to the dog-
house for me and the
next stop was torreon

at torreo n things
looked better

  i heard that there
was a chance down at
jimulco and that night
i rode the sky-side of a
water-car into jimulco

the next day i walked
into the trainmasters
office and asked for a
job running a train

  no more stinger stunts
for me whats the use
of being modest  i
knew that i could handle
the bills and sign the
orders and  couldnt
see the use of working
for eight mex when i
could pull down two
hundre cl and work
less

  nothing doing as a
conductor so i took

the next best thing and woke up to
find that i was again the proud possessor
of one of those brass keys and a badge
when i climbed onto vernons caboose
ill admit that i heaved a sigh of relief
even though my braking pardner was a
greaser for i saw square meals looming
up again and i was more than anxious
to see if the corners would really hurt me

  now ill say a few things about rail-
roading in mexico you can pick up
most any old newspaper and see start-
ling accounts of how the entire crew of
some train has been taken to jail for
somp trivial offense the blood-and-
thunder stories which come out of the
south would fill several volumes

fine jail service

  take it from me straight that there
are worse places than mexico mexican
law is-all right in fact the mexican law
has some few points of superiority over

my mexican pardner said
that it was a good job


the railroad mans magazine

the same brand in the united states but
the way they have of administering their
legal medicine is something fierce

  in the outlying and isolated districts
petty judges are so ignorant that they
couldnt read a law-book even though it
was printed in words of one syllable and
illustrated with signs they never saw
a law-book and never want to their
personal feeling is the only law they
recognize and a gringo american is
legitimate prey	

  in the united states about the first
thing a conductor buys is a good watch-
in mexico his first purchase is generally
a forty-four revolver all you want the
gun for is a bluff for nine-tenths of the
gringoes wouldnt use the gun if they
had a chance

  you see its something like this the
road says that it will hold you responsi-
ble for the merchandise-cars they put
them right next the caboose where you
can watch them  and if some thieving
son of mexico gets busy and steals some
of the imported silk you have to answer
for it to the company

  suppose you catch the fellow in the
act and take a shot at him and get him
then you are up against the mexican
law as it is and a gringo never gets any
of the best of it in court

chile coal and poor water

  braking in mexico isnt just like a
sunday - school picnic by a great deal
about fifty per cent of the trunk-line
traffic is in ores they have the big en-
gines down there now just as they have
in the united states and chile coal and
poor water make the hog-heads life a
burden

   in the first place the fireman cant put
the coal-dust into the fire-box fast enough
to keep her hot and when he does get a
fire just about the place he wants it he
has to open the fire-door and put in the
rake by the time he has the fire-bed
raked the cold air has reached the flues
and they are leaking a steady stream

  water goes to working through the
stack and if its not one thing its an-
other if ever a train-a freight-train
at least-made running-time in mexico
it is not recorded on the books of national
history

  if it happens that an engine is in con-
dition to permit of its making the run-
ning-time the conductor wont let the
engineer speed it for fear he will heat the
boxes a real brass is almost a stranger
down there

a  good  job

  every ore-car is equipped with shell
brasses and as soon as the babbitt has
melted you know what happens if you
find it before the journal drops youre
mighty lucky its easy during the night-
time for every time you hit a curve you
can look along the string and if you
see one blazing you can pull the air and
go over and cool it off

  during the day you have to depend on
your sense of smell or stop every twenty
kilometers and go feel them over my
first trip out of jimulco was south to
la colorado and it took just thirty-two
hours to make the two hundred and ten
kilometers

  on that trip i put on one new air-
hose one gould knuckle chained up
twice packed fourteen hot boxes and put
in three new brasses when i got in on
that run the pay looked mighty poor-
eighty mexican  dobies  a month for
such work as that but my mexican
pardner said that it was a good job
perhaps it was for him but i never did
think much of his tastes

  then the men began to tell me a few
of those choice little stories of the men
who had gone the route there are tw-o
dreaded routes in mexico one is the
wreck route the other is via the little
adobe with the barred door sometimes
called the jail the  hoosgau or any-
thing else you want to call it

into the canyon

  there was skinny farris who had his
little experience with the mexican law
and tim lee of denver who was then
over at zacatecas doing time for the za-
catecas wreck in which sixty mexicans
were killed he was a steady patron at
the national boarding - house for over
thirteen months without a trial and then
they turned him out because it was so
expensive to keep him

after i had finished my time braking
being a boomer brakeman



and had been set up to running a train
i was one of the boys who carried tim
over the pike to theborder at el paso
when he came out of that town he was a
wreck physically and mentally and here
is the straight of how he went there

  lee was an engineer running between
zacatecas and la colorado one eve-
ning he coupled onto a passenger-train
coming out of zacatecas and when the
conductor brought the orders over for his

  when he hit the first bend on that
mountain and gave them about five
pounds to settle them on the rails before
taking the curve he found that his train
line which commands the brakes was
cut off he called for hand-brakes but
what could a few haild-brakes do after
a train had such a start

  he took the next curve all right but
the third one - well they shot out into
a canon like a greased rocket

signature he brought a message from the
despatches asking if lie could make up
fifteen minutes  the running-time from
zacatecas to calero

  tims reply was  if they stay  the
rails i can make it

  from zacatecas to calero is down the
side of the famous zacatecas mountain
and five coaches need a lot of air to
hold them when they are dropping down
a heavy mountain grade mexican car
repairers and inspectors are supposed to
look over every train which pulls out of
zacatecas and when they gave lee the
high sign he supposed that his train was
all right

     rr

  engine tender baggage-car and two
coaches went along sixty mexicans
didnt get home to their beans that night
and lee was picked up from the bottom
of the pile of scrap-iron leg and arm
broken and badly scalded and hurried
off to jail he never came to trial and
he was  more to blame for the accident
than was i or any one else who was a
thousand miles away

what one woman did

  heres another one like it plummer
was a conductor on the chihuahua divi-
sion running between jimulco and la

i climbed into the baggage-
 car and hid under a big
 pile of burlap for eigh-
 teen hours


the railroad mans magazine

colorado he had one american brake-
man on his crew who was a mighty good
man one evening they came to ji-
mulco and when they stepped off the ca-
boose a flossy little greaser policeman
wearing the authority of the law and a
saber led them over to an x jail the
dirtiest little hole you were ever in

  there they stayed for seventy-two
hours with nothing to eat except the
grub which the rest of us were able to
slip through the bars while his -royal
nibs the  hombrey  with the saber was
down at the corner cantina accumulating
a train - load of tequila finally they
brought them into court to try them

  some woman had complained that the
two of them had put her off a freight-
train when she was endeavoring to bum
her way to town to buy some supplies
they had never seen the woman before
and the evidence showed conclusively
that they were not guilty and that the
woman had jumped off a moving train
and broken a leg

   not guilt was the verdict and
then the judge fined them sixty-four dol-
lars thats going some now isnt it
can you beat it if they had been guilty
of that heinous crime they would have
been digging in the salt-mines still

  after that  decided that if i ever
caught up with trouble before trouble
caught up with me i would make the big
hike for the line without the formality
of kissing my mexican friends good-by
and never take a chance with mexican
justice outside the city of mexico

  i am awful glad i decided that way
for it was just a month after that when
i got into it never mind what it was
i didnt take my bills down to the office
when i got in that trip i had the brake-
raan register in for me

  he was a mexican and the mexican

the

 law isnt made for the native-its made
 for the gringo he took the bills and i
 took the second section of a passenger-
 train which happened to be pulling out
 for the states

   i climbed into the baggage-car and hid
 underneath a big pile of burlap for
 eighteen hours until my friends the bag-
 gage-master and the conductor came over
 and dug me out and pointed through the
 open door to where i could see old
 glory waving from the flagpole of port
 bliss near el paso

    half an hour later i was over the line
 making naughty faces at mexico and
 vowing that  would never visit that
 beautiful country again one trip was
 enough - especially under the circum-
 stances-and i hardly believe that even
 in time i would ever get used to eating
 beans and tortillas three times a day

   so far i have kept that vow i wait-
 ed around el paso until the pay - car
 came over the line some twenty days
 later drew my mexican pesos had them
 changed into real money and then while
 i had the coin i bought a ticket back to
 the dear old east and went prospecting
 for a job-not a railroad job but a place
 where you are home every night and
 as long as you -work and duck the street-
 cars you are reasonably sure of meeting
 yourself at the supper-table every evening

   while i have the greatest respect for
 the men who follow the railroad game
 a grae full of more danger and real ro-
 mance than any other calling in the
 world oiill i would rather lie on the out-
 side looking in than on the inside where
 you cant see at all and i guess a fel-
 low will reach that stage soon enough
 where all the friends pass by and say
  how natural he looks  without tempt-
 ing fate by hanging around a baldwin
 hog or a dog-house

end
 the death of  dread 

by ralph c mulligan

this is the story of the most unfortunate locomotive that ever turned
a wheel- dread  -cursed by every man who ever had anything
to do with her we have never heard of a locomotive history to equal
hers if so-if any of our readers can tell a more remarkable story of wreck
and ruin-we want to see it and we cordially invite them to submit it for
our consideration

    it seems strange almost uncanny that one disaster after another ac-
companied by loss of life should have followed with such regularity
is it a wonder that engineers absolutely refused to take her out

after twenty years of appalling disaster the old man-killer of the
rockies whose name was a byword adorns
a scrap-heap

read  the fiend-driven
locomotive which has
launched into eternity a
dozen of her train crews
and has been in twice that
many fatal wrecks the
locomotive which superstitious firemen
and engineers swear was haunted by ffie
fantom spirits of her victims who could
be seen at night awful in aspect sitting
in the engine cab or gliding up over the
pilot is in the scrap-heap  dead after
twenty years of terrible service

  hearts of railroad men on the denver
and rio grande beat slower for all
along the line she-was known as a man-
killer death sat at her throttle

  after her last fatal wreck eight years
ago she was virtually abandoned with

a death roll of seven engineers six fire-
men and almost two scorc of passengers

  she earned her name during the first
two years she was in service when one
disaster after another occurred in rapid
succession always fatal to the engine
crew and frequently to the passengers
railroad men soon believed the  was
hoodooed and it became increasingly dif-
ficult to persuade an engineer to run her
she was transferred from one division
to another leaving destruction in her
wake and bearing such an ominous his-
tory that among the more superstitious
ii was like getting a death-warrant to
be called to take her out

   dread   was one of three
anthracite burners the first of such type
to lie used in the rocky mountain coun-


the railroad mans magazine

try sent out in  and put on the
passenger run between gunnison and
grand junction in western colorado

  it was a narrow-gage line which had
been built in  and followed a
treacherous tortuous path-through moun-
tain gorges and across deep canons-the
only route through the rockies at this
point until the tunneling of marshalls
pass a year later

  on the night in early spring when 
left grand junction on her first trip
over the division bill duncan who was
the first man to pull a train over the
continental divide was at the throttle
and josh zoogley was firing

  they were well on their way toward
gunnison the new locomotive running
without a hitch duncan opened her
up on a straight stretch down black
eagle canon

  he did not know that part of the
bridge had been carried away without
warning the train plunged into the river
bearing the engineer and fireman to their
death to this day the exact number
of passengers who lost their lives is not
known

   dread   lay at the bottom of the
canon until late in the summer when the
river receded and she could be raised
she was taken to the yards at salida
and put in condition she went back
to her run again in november and for
two months -nothing happened

bill godfreys end

  bill godfrey was the next engineer
to whom she was assigned with a fire-
man named bell who was making his
first run on the division godfrey left
gunnison on christmas eve both train
crew and passengers eagerly anticipating
their arrival at grand junction to spend
the holiday

  it was bright moonlight but just
around blindmans curve between esca-
lanta and domingues a ten-ton boulder
which had loosened and fallen obstruct-
ed the path of the train it was going
at a high rate of speed and the impact
of the collision was terrible godfrey
and bell were instantly killed and several
passengers were added to the list of fa-
talities

  it took nearly two months to repair

the engine and she was not put in service
again until early in march  al-
ready old engineers were fighting shy of
her and frank bratt a new man on the
road offered to take the run

  pie made only two round trips on
another bright moonlight night the th
of march  dread   and bratt left
gunnison passed blindmans curve
where godfrey and bell had but recent-
ly been killed and started down the
black eagle canon which had been the
scene of the first disaster

  between thapaniro and currecanti
one of the worst snowslides for many
a season was encountered when 
struck it she turned turtle and both en-
gineer and fireman were crushed to
death in this case the passengers es-
caped unscathed

few would take her out

  after this accident the locomotive
had such a name that few men could
be persuaded to take her out for over
a year she lay in the yard at grand junc-
tion and then an attempt was made to
put her back on her old run but so firm-
ly implanted in the hearts of all the en-
gineers was the belief that  was hoo-
dooed that all sorts of excuses were made
for refusing to run her

  it was at this time that she was nick-
named  dread  which has clung to
her even until to-day when she lies a
mass of battered and rusty iron

  uncanny stories were circulated about
her tales of spirits that were seen at
night clambering in and out of the cab
as she lay in the roundhouse premoni-
tions which all six of the crews who
were on her death roll were said to have
told them of their fate

  in despair at the reports from division
headquarters the locomotive was ordered
transferred to salt lake city to run
between that city and ogden a distance
of about eighty miles over prairie coun-
try

  at first there were only minor acci-
dents two rear-end freight collisions in
which no one was hurt and a derailment
that killed an unknown hobo who was
riding back of the tender

   mad ole  gleason was her engi-
neer and in the remembrance of the old-
             

the death of  dread 	

est railroader in the west a more dare-
devil hand never held the throttle for
fifteen years mad ole  had been in
an engine cab and in a half-score wrecks
but never once had he been more than
scratched

  his friends said he had a charmed
life and the old engineer believed it him-
self within six months from the day
when he set foot inside  dread  
he was picked up a corpse

into a stock-train

  it was a head-on collision with a
train of live stock the engine crew of
the freight jumped before  with
 mad ole  in the cab piled on top
of them in all five persons were killed
in this wreck the cause was never satis-
factorily explained people merely said
 she collided with 

  although now only three years old
 was so battered up when she came
out of this collision that after she had
been repaired she was relegated to
freight service

   for over two years her history was un-
eventful and many thought that the
hoodoo had been broken during that
time her name lost some of its former
terror and then one night lest her old
record be entirely forgotten some un-
known hand carved in the woodwork of
the cab the names of the eight men who
had met their death there and the list
and dates of the various wrecks in which
she had figured

  from that time although there were
still no new accidents misfortune seemed
to follow all those connected with her
sickness and death among the train crew
and their families ill luck of various
kinds which was all traced by the su-
perstitious victims to the old locomotive

when flynn went crazy

   fread   celebrated her sixth
anniversary in a startling way which
as told by old railroad men is half fact
and half legend

  it was a sunday morning and she was
standing in the ogden yards with steam
up ready for her eighty-mile haul en-
gineer tom flynn was in the cab and
liis brother was fireman suddenly flynn

opened the throttle and the locomotive
sprang forward and was a hundred yards
down the track before the yardmaster
or anybody realized what had happened

   she did not stop until she rolled over
an embankment on a curve twelve miles
away two trains which were in her
path were flagged and got on sidings
without a second to spare

  fireman flynn was picked up uncon-
scious beside the track several miles frrm
where  engine had been ditched he
died next day as a result of internal in-
juries but not until half delirious he
had told of a mad tussle with his brother
and how he was finally thrown backward
from the cab

  the engineer was found pinned be-
neath his overturned engine a raving
lunatic as this story is told in smoky
cabooses on stormy nights it is declared
that flynn went mad while staring at
the death roll of the victims of 

   if it had been difficult before it was
impossible now to get an engineer to run
her she was once more transferred-
this time to alamosa in southwestern
colorado on the other side of the moun-
tains she was sent deadhead from og-
den across the divide to her new home
so unwilling were those who knew her
history to ride in her cab

her dumber changed

  before starting on her new run she
underwent a thorough overhauling and
painting the offensive death roll in the
cab was removed and most important
of all her number was changed to 
in the hope of forever burying  dread
  and all the superstition which sur-
rounded her

  during the next few years little is
known of her history although gradu-
ally her former identity became known
and she was regarded with curious in-
terest then came tales that fantoms
had been seen on moonlight nights riding
on the pilot as she puffed slowly up the
mountain grades and these fantoms al-
ways had one hand upraised toward the
number as if trying to change the   
to a  

   one spring during the freshets the old
locomotive once more rolled into a ditch
scalding to death an engineer named


the railroad mans magazine

peters and maiming her fireman but
strangest of all when she was brought
into alamosa again there was her right-
ful number   back in its old place

  who changed it it was the spooks
some of the superstitious claimed but
after that she kept her number and her
old name  dread 

  for the next five years she remained
in the alamosa roundhouse used only
on occasional emergencies gradually
growing more antiquated and dilapi-
dated feared and hated by all from the
oldest eagle-eye to the youngest call-boy

  before making her last journey to
join her less famous sisters in the burial-
ground of scrap-iron at the burnham
station  was destined to be in an-
other wreck more horrible in its conse-
quences than any in her evil history

  it was a long winter on the alamosa
division-a hard winter with wrecks
snow-slides and washouts that nearly par-
alyzed traffic during that winter not
one fire was built beneath its boilers

  then one june morning she steamed
out in the yard in charge of frank mur-
phy an engineer who alone of all who

knew her record scoffed at bad luck
jenkins his fireman had just finished
eight weeks in the hospital the  was
to take a string of empty gravel-cars
to mears junction to load and every
operator along the line shuddered with
dread as he sent the number

  that night frank murphy started on
the return trip to alamosa with a heavy
train of gravel it was all down grade
and only two trains to meet six miles
out of mears junction on the worst
piece of track on the whole division
murphy suddenly realized that his train
was running away

  he shut off steam applied the worn-
out air and whistled for hand-brakes

  no one lived to tell what- happened
at the foot of the mountain the runaway
crashed into a light mixed train the
wreck caught fire and murphy jenkins
and the conductor the engineer and a
brakeman of the mixed train were killed

   dread   never made another
run the man-killer locomotive which
had more deaths ai d more wrecks to her
credit than any other in the intermoun-
tain country was abandoned forever

           a smooth game is checked by a dupe
           who happened to be waiting for a local

was  pm when the toledo
train left pittsburgh  dis-
posing my baggage i re-
moved my coat and opened
the window then with my
pipe for solace  lay back in
the serene consciousness of having ar-
ranged for the comfort of the all-night
passenger in a day-coach mine was the
third facing seat on the right of the car
the first being occupied by two men who
seemed to have already traveled some
distance on the train opposite them
were two railroad men deadheading

  a few other yawning travelers were
scattered through the car behind me

  when we had made some fifteen miles
i finished my smoke and started to doze
but my time was not yet

   smoke these on me i heard one of
the men on first seat right say as he
tossed two cigars to the railroad men op-
posite he leaned over and i saw his
face-lean even to sharpness with thin
but overly loose lips

   boys he went on to the two across
 two days ago i was flat on my back-
hadnt even a feather for the aborigines
head on a red cent now ive come into
something thatll make the success of
rockefeller and carnegie look like that
negative virtue which is often referred
to as being the color of verdigris they
all thought i was good for nothing-the
folks in toledo  mean-but ill show
em by agreeably making the fortunes of

 some forty or fifty relatives giving em
 all jobs working for me

    it sounds fishy doesnt it but its
 true i say gus turning to his com-
 panion   cant hardly believe in such
 good luck-that im really president of
 this new company were organizing
 hoo hoo hoc hee hee

   presently he and gus got out pencil
 and paper and commenced figuring in
 the lull i dozed off

   next thing i knew i was awakened
 by the words  ill give you two hun-
 dred a month and expenses and found
 the man of the financial bonanza in
 earnest converse with a man who occu-
 pied the seat in front of mine

    rent an office and storeroom in
 mansfield your home town he contin-
 ued in tones husky with enthusiasm
  and store white lead and oils by the
 ton

   he came back and sat with the stran-
 ger in his desire to explain more fully

     now ill furnish you with an auto-
 mobile-steam or electric-and you can
 equip your office to suit yourself as our
 manager dont stint get good fur-
 niture-put a brussels rug on the floor
 if you want it advertise freely and
 above all get good men-and hold em
 this he added with insistent emphasis
 and went on

     f some other company pays its
painters and decorators five dollars a
day pay yours five and a quarter or



the railroad mans magazine

five and a half-but hold em if you
have to pay six

   began to throw my sound-receivers
wide open about this time-for a capital-
ist who is hiring men at high salaries for
a new concern has a most absorbing at-
traction for a clerk who like myself has
not yet reached the century mark in his
monthly stipend

  i began to cast about for a pretext to
talk to this man maybe this stuff about
 opportunity once gone is lost forever
was no stuff after all here seemed to
be a chance for me to better myself if
i sat still and did nothing i might never
see another-surely never a better just
then the man who hired rose to return to
his own seat and the stranger moved to a
seat across the car

   dont forget f h andrews 
victoria building toledo ohio said
the former injparting  and wire or come
to see me personally when you get things
in shape and he and gus returned to
their pencils and paper

  i must have dozed again for when i
was next conscious we had stopped at
alliance and a man came through with
hot coffee and sandwiches the man who
hired bought some and set about demol-
ishing them

  it struck me as queer that one who had
fallen into sudden opulence should ride
all night in a smoker and lunch on coffee
and sandwiches but i concluded that
either he must be a man of hard demo-
cratic sense or had not as yet come into
possession of much ready money i ob-
served that the railroad men had moved
my traps to the left front seat where was
a most promising field for stretching my
six feet one for slumberous purposes

  i hadnt settled long before the man
who hired looked at me and whispered to
gus then he came across and i was
glad i had not made first advances for
now i was in a position of greater ad-
vantage

   can i talk to you a little while  he
began and at my acquiescence dropped
beside me

   my names andrews he com-
menced- f h andrews president of
the andrews decorating company of
toledo

  i felt a chill at the nearness of so great
a person but the american in me rose

up - diogenes i believe was the first
american-and i disclosed my name with
some sonority

   were just organizing said an-
drews- going to have branches in all
the large cities of the country want
men-good men-every class what is
your business and what does it pay
he ended in crisp tones that admitted of
no application of the word inquisitive

   bookkeeper thousand a year i
replied with equal telegraphic direct-
ness

   we need you give you twenty-four
hundred a year if you will act as our man-
ager gus turning to his companion
who came across  shake hands with mr
nichols mr nichols mr wilson my
brother-in-law mr wilson he went
on to me  has left a job that paid him
two hundred and a quarter to help
me systematize my new company so
gus he questioned and gus nodded

   how do you want me to begin and
where  i inquired

   rent a place-storeroom and office
-in pittsburgh your home town he
replied tapping my knee  store it with
white lead and oils furnish your office
well hire good painters and decora-
tors-good mind you-at five and a half
or six a day if necessary but dont hesi-
tate to overbid other companies in wages
and underbid for work in order to hold
your men and secure the contracts you
can refer all bills to me-f it andrews
president  victoria building toledo

   ill send you an automobile-steam
or electric-or you can come on through
with me to toledo and well buy it now
and you can take it back with you think
it over and tell me how you like the of-
fer and he and gus returned to their
pencils and paper

  well i want to tell you the thoughts
whirled in and out upon me about then
two hundred a month a practically
independent position  my own boss  but
where was i to find credit to store white
lead and oils by the ton to buy furniture
or even pay the first months rent and
he had said- nothing about advancing
anything nor offered to establish my
credit in pittsburgh the matter began
to look to me like a newspaper advertise-
ment for managers with some capital to
invest
the man who hired



  well what do you think about it
called andrews across the car  will
you take it 

   dont know whether i will or not
i replied  i dont know you nor you
me but ill think about it

   says hell think about it hoo iioo

cause the ravings of a harmless lunatic
were such

  wilson looked back to see if andrews
could see him but he had gone through
the swinging-door into the second com-
partment of the smoker so wilson came
over and sat by me

men

hoo hee hee spurted the man who
hired to gus

   why man he went on  its a sur-e
thing make your fortune well buy
materials in such quantities that we can
underbid them all well get the con-
tracts for all the great amusement parks
in the country - painting their scenery
and ornamentation

   well theres time yet and if you de-
cide later to accept you have my address
and can write me and he moved down
the car-to make more managers  sup-
posed

  i was beginning to wonder why  gus 
wilson said so little for to my mind he
looked as if he knew more than president
andrews i was startled to hear the
mans voice just then speaking to me in
a low tone across the aisle

   dont mind him he said- hes
crazy im taking him from reading to
toledo asylum easiest way to get him
there is to keep him in a good humor
with this rot of organizing a company

  well i just wilted you could have
knocked me out of the window as easy
as puffing a pipe the bubble was
busted and here was i disappointed be-

   yes hes crazy-but harmless if
kept in a good humor i wonder im not
as bad as lie is considering ive hashed
over this rot of his since  pm yesterday
-almost twelve hours

  we talked a while and he told me his
companion had paresis the fruit of a
wild young life he was about thirty-
five now he said i became mighty sor-
ry for the fellow and more so for the
mother to whom he was going-wilson
said she lived in toledo

  pretty soon he rose and gathered up
their traps for as he said they hadnt
long to ride now and he might as well
go out where andrews was to keep an
eye on him

  for a few minutes  watched the
lessening blackness without and knew
that dawn was not far off although it
was still dark in the fields and along the
sky-line

  andrews looked in at the door

   better accept mr nichols said he
 well have a booming concern in a year
from now

  i was sorry for the poor fellow and
humored him assuring him i would ac-
cept  and then with another of his


the railroad mans magazine

laughs and a good-by he dramatically
departed leaving me to sadly contem-
plate the misguided actions of a man yet
young bereft of what was in all proba-
bility a bright and enterprising mind-
a mother doomed to bitter disappoint-
ment in the hope of her boys achieve-
ments

  the train stopped the brakeman
called wagerstown and i knew the next
stop was mine-goonburg as we start-
ed again i was wondering how many in
the other car were enlisted as poor an-
drewss managers for he had talked to
every one in my part of the car the
swinging-door flew open admitting a red-r
faced conductor

   have any of you gentlemen lost
money or valuables asked he un-
steadily

  with one accord we all began to feel
for watches jewelry and money i felt
in my right-hand pocket where should
be fifty dollars and some odd silver it
was empty

  i felt in the left-hand pocket and
found i still had forty dollars in bills
having luckily divided the bulk between
the pockets

  several others reported money gone
and some both money and watches

   its those scoundrels that i thought
were a lunatic and his keeper yelled
the conductor  they picked my pocket
of all the cash fares and left the train a
minute ago at wagerstown

  he pulled the emergency cord and
when the train stopped we ran the quar-
ter-mile back to the station in a body

  but as might have been expected there
was no trace of the rogues and id lost
a lot of sentimentality and pity on one
of the wretches-as well as fifty dollars
of tj s treasury output

  we piled sorrowfully back on the
train and in a few minutes i alighted at
my destination-pro tern-two miles far-
ther on

  for fear some one should desire some
sort of description of goonburg i give
my own impressions  arrived at 
am and may possibly be inclined to
give too much of a gray-carbon tone to
the picture goonburg is situated some-
where on the fag-end of nowhere not-
withstanding its being a junction for two
railroads and having a respectable frame

station and baggage-room-joint of
course

  the only water-tight surmise i could
conjure up explaining the beginning of
goonburg was that perhaps there yet re-
mained some odd lumber after building
the station and shelters were built to
house the male incumbents at such times
when each left his favorite roost on the
station-platform

  the waiting-room as i saw on enter-
ing was ell-shaped with the office and
ticket-window on the inner angle two
doors led from the extremes of the ell
one giving out on the main-line platform
the other on the branch-line track a
light-the only one save those in the of-
fice-burned at the corner of the office
wall but on the p t and q side by the
ticket-window leaving the branch wait-
ing-room in comparative gloom

  i deposited my effects on a seat mean-
ing to try for some sleep for i knew
of no train to freeport before eight

   what is the quickest way i can take
to get to freeport i asked going to
the window

  the night-operator yawned and ap-
peared to consider

   walk i guess he said and grinned
no train till eight and you cant reach
any trolley lines from here

  so i went back and tried to sleep
stretched out on that bench it was no
go and i lit my pipe and strolled out
into the night when i got tired of
this i sat on a ladder that lay against
the front of my waiting-room

  i had been out about half an hour
when i heard voices coming from down
the track toward wagerstown present-
ly the forms of two men carrying satch-
els loomed dimly through the early
light and passed on into the station by
the other door they had not seen me
because of a window that bulged out
from the office deepening the shadow
where i sat

  the windows were open-it was july
-and i heard them set down their bags
and one of them struck up a conversation
with the operator the voice sounded
reminiscent

   pretty lonesome staying here all
night isnt it  the voice was casual

   oh sometimes yes and sometimes
no came the answer  i go on at
the man who hired



eleven and im relieved at seven in the
morning always some chore to do
though-settin signals answerin the
key and so on when i get a half-hour
or so i cat-nap or read a magazine
story

  i looked slantwise through the win-
dow being curious about the
strangers voice and saw the
operator leaning on the win-
dow-shelf one hand under
his chin supported by his
elbow the other hanging
down inside the strangers
i couldnt see for the
agents body blocked the
window

   excursion up to cedar
point to-morrow isnt
there remarked the strain
ger-again casually

   sure w ant tickets 
asked the key-tapper and
ticket-seller combined

 not now we may go
up in the morning though

many going 

   yep sold a hundred
and five to-day guess
therell be more sold before
train-time

  just then a smith  wes-
son appeared - through the
window and the stranger
made another casual remark

   better pass out that
coin for the hundred and five
tickets lie said adding

 and any more you may
have that isnt tacked down

neednt trouble about re-
fusing for theres another
gatling covering you and he nodded to-
ward the door where the other stranger
appeared leaning through the window

  i looked too and saw gus wilson
the lunatic-keeper i had no doubt then
who the other was-the man with the
reminiscent voice

  i had no weapon and was casting
about for some way to aid the operator
the loss of that fifty dollars and all that
pity and sentiment still rankled deep

  suddenly the agent dodged and as his
arm shot up there came a flash and re-
port followed by two more that sounded
as one gus fell with a thud that made

me think he was dead and the operator
staggered back into a chair his revolver
falling to the floor the other man-
andrews-slipped in through the win-
dow and was picking up the agents gun
as i crept softly around toward the other
door

  when i got there i heard no move-
ment from gus so i peeped carefully
around the jamb he was unconscious-
dead maybe-and his gun lay a foot in-
side the door

  i secured it quietly and made sure gus
had  more weapons in case he should
come to i could hear andrews presi-
dent of the andrews decorating com-
panyransacking the cash drawer and
then he moved over to the open safe

  lights began to move in the houses
down the road so help in some form
would doubtless arrive soon i crept
along the office wall to the ticket-window


the railroad mans magazine

then rising suddenly i leveled the gun
at andrewss back

   mr andrews i said  you are
abroad a trifle early however i al-
ways admired early risers and you ap-
pear to be engaged in catching the pro-
verbial worm

bat he sprang toward me cool wasnt
he well i was too hasty for him and
fired as his hand was diving under the
shelf boring an awful hole in his arm
and plowing up that good yellow-pine
floor deep enough to plant a potato in

  he sprang back with a cry then stood

i was too hasty for him
and fired as his hand was
diving under the shelf

  he whirled around and eyed the muz-
zle of guss thirty-eight-well not ex-
actly with eagerness but still with self-
possession

   well ill be gashdoodled he re-
marked  if here isnt one of those deco-
rating gulls on top after all and with
guss gun too so i suppose the poor boy
is down and out

  his eyes dropped to a point just inside
and under the shelf and quick as an eye-

coolly stripping up his sleeve and wrap-
ping a handkerchief around the hole

   good shot he vouchsafed knotting
the bandage tightly  much obliged
for sparing my head-piece

  it is personal inconvenience i am
eliminating i returned reaching over
and securing the two guns from the
cash drawer beneath the shelf  no ob-
ligation due on your part i continued
 your errors in not making certain that
the man who hired



the agent was alone and then in sepa-
rating yourself from your gun are re-
sponsible just sit down over there and
be quiet and some of your friends will
soon see you comfortably housed for the
night-what there is left of it dont
crack your etiquette again for i only hit
twice out of three where i aim and the
next one may go higher and a little to the
left

  he did as i ordered but seemed hurt
that a former dupe had got the upper
hand of him

   throw up your hands durn ye

   turned to see the town marshal and
two farmers with leveled guns

   pull that body out of the way i
rejoined  and open that door your
man is sitting in there waiting for his
wristlets

  their jaws dropped at my tone but

the railroads

that there has been a decided change
in the attitude of the public especially
in the west toward the railroads and the
questions arising out of railroad operation
is frequently made evident nowadays

  the radical intolerance which character-
ized public sentiment two or three years
ago is giving place to a rational desire to
see the relations of public and railroads put
on a better basis there is recognition of
the interdependence of the agenciesof trans-
portation and the communities they serve and
the corollary of that interdependence is that
fair treatment on both sides is necessary
says the minneapolis journal

  evidence of this changed attitude is usu-
ally apparent when some great railroad
builder like james j hill appears on the
platform at a public gathering mr hill
busy man though he is readily responds to
such calls and is usually received with the
utmost enthusiasm his plea that the farm-
ers of the west ought to remain good
neighbors with the railroads was enthusias-
tically received the incident would have
been almost impossible at any farmers gath-
ering four or five years ago although mr
hill himself by reason of his intelligent
interest in farming and far-sighted under-
standing of its needs has always been a
welcome guest at farmers gatherings

  nor has the change been entirely on the
part of the public the railroads them-
selves have moved over to a position that
has made the publics altitude possible

they did it and soon the promoter of-
financial ventures that made rockefeller
and carnegie look green was under guard
and on the way to the calaboose the
plucky operator was shot through the
shoulder but a dash of water wakened
him

  he wanted to know how they caught
the fellows and looked astonished when
they pointed me out having actually be-
lieved me to be one of them

  well i got that fifty dollars back and
the conductor got his cash fares all
the other passengers who could be found
were reimbursed

  gus was dead-the agents bullet
struck him right between the eyes and
 was glad when my train came for i
had to repeat the telling of that  daring
attempt to hold up a night-operator 
at least forty-nine times

more friendly

 they have abandoned such ancient and
revered principles of rate-making as that
expressed by  all the traffic will bear
they have come to a realization of the fact
that deriving their rights to act as common
carriers from the public they are charged
with certain duties toward the public that
created them

  the more enlightened and practical rail-
road men are sparing no effort to establish
better relations with the public at all points
of contact station agents and trainmen
are instructed to be polite and accommoda-
ting to patrons

  they re to exert themselves to the utmost
in this direction for the great managers
realize that on such little things is public
sentiment founded

  mr harriman himself before his death
completely changed his attitude toward the
public and toward the publics humble serv-
ants the reporters this change sprang from
a realization that the success of his plans
were impossible if he permitted the hostility
and prejudice against him which his reti-
cence no less than his policies had aroused
to continue and to grow

  the great railroad problems are largely
unsolved as yet we are again approaching
their serious consideration in congress the
president has outlined far-reaching con-
structive legislation in the changed attitude
of public and railroads toward each other
there is promise of solutions of these prob-
lems with justice to both sides

persistent gratitude

smith the railroad agent at a suburban
station saved the life of a dignified
gentleman waiting for a train by pulling

him from in front of a through train on
another track

  the dignified gentleman lost all his dig-
nity for the moment and was much con-
fused but not so much as to forget that
something was due to the agent follow-
ing a grateful impulse lie thrust his hand
into his pocket and drawing it forth ex-
claimed

a line of talk

according to the philadelphia ledger
- two telephone girls were talking over
the wire the subject was a lawn party
which was to take place the next day both
were discussing what they should wear and
after five minutes had come to no decision

  in the midst of this important conversa-
tion a masculine voice interrupted asking
humbly what number he had the lack of
any reply did not squelch the inquirer for he
asked again for the number

  one of the girls became indignant and
scornfully asked

   what line do you think you are on
anyhow  

  well said the man i am not sure
but judging from what i have heard i should
say i was on a clothes-line-express ga-

one cold winter morning a man of tall
and angular build was walking down
a steep hill at a quick pace a piece of ice
under the snow caused him to lose control
of his feet he began to slide and was
unable to stop

  at a crossing half-way down he encoun-
tered a large heavy woman the meeting
was sudden and before either realized it
a collision ensued and both were sliding
down hill the thin man underneath the
fat woman on top

  when the bottom was reached and the
woman was trying to recover her breath
and her feet these faint words were borne
to her ear

classical paintings

 a classical education said the en-
gineer who could read latin when
lie was eight years old and had mastered

hebrew before he was ten  should be
given to every boy no matter what his sur-
roundings are

   for instance a sign-painter should re-
ceive a classical education he has often
to do with subjects taken from the classics
and if ignorant of classical history then
his value is so much the less

   i was once connected with a railroad
company which had a number of barges
and the first one was named ajax after
a short time we built another barge and
we decided to have it also named ajax

    sent for our painter and told him we
would have a series of these boats and
would give the same name to all

    did you say you was going to have a
series of them ajaxes he asked

     yes

   a few days after we went to look at the
barge and he had painted on it  bjax the
next vessel he named  cjax and then came
and asked us what the tom-fool words
meant-san francisco call

ike flannery the express-agent
whose experience with pigs and the
multiplication table are recited in  pigs
is pigs is not the only humble agent to
become entangled in the complexities of
live-stock transportation

  the prosy reports of the interstate com-
merce commission hint at a story with
somewhat similar possibilities

  the agent of a shipper not knowing the
value of a dog to be sent by express never-
theless named a valuation of  and the
resulting charges to destination amounted
to  the dog was actually worth 
and at this valuation the express charges
would have been  the consignee de-
clined to accept delivery and pay the
charges demanded upon inquiry whether
charges may be collected  the basis of the
actual value of the dog it was held that the
shipper is responsible for the act of his
agent and that the charges at the valuation
given must be collected

 what we wonder has become of the
dog during the time that this appeal has
been traveling to the interstate commerce
commission 

 has some humble mike flannery been
buying it biscuits out of his slender wages
and if the owner still refuses to pay 
charges  a  dog what will become
of the dog under what account could
his up-keep be entered

less its officers will decide to leave to

ome fifteen minutes afterward
  the door of the back room
  opened and mr peter marsh-

    run to earth said he a note of
 triumph in the low voice  steve told
 you a story this morning you wouldnt
 listen to father it was true just the
 same and youve got to listen to me now

    thats what i came here for re-
 torted marshfield what is it
 leaning against the table his hands
 behind his back he heard his son through
 without a word or a gesture of surprise
 only when i laid the map and the deeds
 before him did he move then he took
 his glasses from his pocket placed them
 deliberately on his nose and leaned
 down to examine the booty even then
 his face revealed nothing as he studied
 the papers one after the other when
 he had finished hestraightened up re-
 placed the glasses in his pocket antf-
 turned to me

    all of us make mistakes he said

  i made one this morning i was busy
 and you irritated me at the time i re-
 member i thought it was all moonshine
 of course i might have known that if
 rocca had had the papers he would have
 come up with them before still they
 are not much good without the key and
 roccas got that you say

   confound the key i broke out

  hes got miss bigontina 

    so i understand old marshfield
 raised his handto stroke his mustache
 with a hesitation that sat strangely on
 him  i suppose you are in love with
 her and you dont like the idea we
 might try a trade-the papers for the
  magazine single copies  centi


the railroad mans magazine

girl i dare say youd think it a good
one

  david shot one quick glance at me

   how do you propose to find the man
to make the trade with  he asked  we
cant take the police to the house with-
out killing miss bigontina how are
you going to see rocca

  his father reached behind him for his
stick  by sending in my card he an-
swered  thats one way of seeing peo-
ple  and if i do see him ill get the girl
-but im not so sure he will get these
papers

  i was too amazed to question how
truly i had not known davids father
well the man who would not even lis-
ten to me when i intruded upon him in
his office was now of his own accord
about to venture alone where no other
man in the city knowing what he knew
would have dared to go

  it was quite true that he was safer
than any other man would have been
peter marshfield was too big a figure in
america to be attacked with impunity
and in this case he was roccas last hope
for the wealth he had snatched at but
it takes nerve to remember such things
when one is defenseless in the castle of
ones enemies

  unbounded admiration for the stern
fighter in front of me was the one defi-
nite thought in my brain as we roiled
away from the saloon in the cab the
cabman had agreed to take us as near as
he dared to the house from there the
banker would have to trust to his own
resources they had never failed him
yet as my gaze drank in the strength
of the jaw and mouth the heavy fore-
head -and deep-set eyes i did not be-
lieve that they would fail him now

  the cab rolled down fifth avenue
and into washington square under the
white arch when i first passed it that
day on my way to maria the morning sun
had been high above it now the white
marble was bathed in the glory of the
flaming west already the memorial cross
had sprung into light over the bare trees
and crowded pavements the day was
dying the longest i have ever lived
with unspoken thankfulness that it was
over at last i leaned forward to see its
farewell

  the cab stopped with an abruptness

that flung me onto the knees of the
startled banker the door was wrenched
open a man shot in upon us slammed
the door behind him and cried out to the
driver   go on  go on   the next
instant david and i held him gagged
and helpless at our feet

   what the deuce- my friend began
when i knocked his hand from the fel-
lows mouth it was the violinist of the
auvergne and he was struggling hard
to speak

   i have come back he spluttered in
breathless foreign english as i helped
him to the few inches by my side on the
narrow forward seat  i have come
back to help you i ran before but i
am no coward- i will fight

  good for you and how david
spoke in light-hearted joy of battle as
he faced our unexpected ally  whom
are you going to fight my friend

   i fight them all they have been
worse to me than to you why should
i leave you to fight then

   search me returned young marsh-
field  but you didnt come in here as
if you were spoiling for a fight

   the violinist spoke with inborn dignit
 i fight sir he said   but i fight
with my head as well as my hands i
wish to aid mr paget who has much
befriended me not betray him there-
fore i waste no time where spies may
watch

   you are wise as well as brave i put
in in haste to intercept whatever ill-
judged jest david may have meditated
 but what brings you back you told
me that you were a doomed man in new
york

   i met rosa he answered  i met
her as i went to take my train i knew
her years ago when we were both young

   we talked and she told me things
that i did not know-that it was the si-
gnorina bigontina that they pursue that
rocca himself may be here that now is
my time to strike for the daughter of the
dead signor bigontina the man who
helped me to strike at the man who mur-
dered my brother i come to fight sir
 well youve come to the right
shop cried david startled out of his
humor by the intensity of the mans emo-
tion  at least you have if this cab-
man is telling the truth
the spider of palermo



   where are you going

  the violinist leaned forward his eyes
bright with the fire i had seen in them
when music carried him beyond himself

  to jefferson street- jefferson
street at least my father is were-
now whats the matter  

   it is the house-i have heard them
talk of it ah do you think i sang with
my eyes and ears shut in the auvergne
all these years-i who knew their devil-
try they did not know me-only
ghedina-and him i never thought to
see again so i watched and listened and
learned

   what did you learn

  old marshfield spoke as he might have
spoken to a clerk in his office he was
going to risk his life in that house but
there was no quaver of fear in the per-
emptory demand for information

  it is their most secret place sir
they have several inthe city but this is
their most secret i have known of many
who went there but never of any who
came away

   you will know of one soon re-
turned mr marshfield as he settled back
into his seat  is that all 

   no sir i have investigated myself
-quietly you understand-for always i
have dreamed of my revenge it is not
all the house is on the heights the
water is below  but from the house to
the water there is an alley running down
to a dock

  he paused for a second as though to
give due weight to his next words

   a few days ago a steamer came to
that dock it is a fruit steamer the
cavour from palermo it is one of
roccas there are lumber and coal-
yards near that dock  the cavour is sup-
posed to carry fruit why is she there 
 lemons grunted david  by
jove more lemons  but his father and
i sat silent

  it is quite plain marshfield spoke
at length with cold precision  lie in-
tends to take the girl away on the
steamer we could have the house and
the boat searched we might find some-
thing but it would not please you ste-
phen if you really care for her i will
try him with these papers there is the
chance that lie will bite if he does not
we will try something else

  he put the cigar back in his mouth
as though the last word had been said
smoking steadily on as we drove toward
the bridge there were a thousand ques-
tions we might have asked a thousand
things that i would have been eager to
learn at another time now with all
my life staked on one wild throw i had
no interest in the shape of the dice

  the violinists long fingers twined
nervously together and his lean face wa
blazing with the thirst for vengeance
but he said nothing in absolute silence
the four of us crowded in the cab jolt-
ed onward through the swarming streets

  only when we were high above the
river in the center of the bridge the
musicians hand closed on my arm
look he breathed it is the ca-
vour

  his arm pointed downward through
the open window of the cab to the
brooklyn water-front a tramp steamer
lay at a pier below us a thin trail of
smoke rising from her funnel into the
softness of the coming night on the
heights above clear against the evening
sky stretched a row of commonplace
brownstone houses in one of them or
in that steamer was maria bigontina
the cab rolled on over the bridge as we
peered through the narrbw window until
houses and steamer were shut from our
sight

  a minute later we came to a halt and
the driver appeared at the window

   this is near enough he said any-
body can show you how to get to jeffer-
son street im not going there i can
tell you

  peter marshfield stepped heavily down
to the sidewalk for a brief second he
stood motionless then turned with out-
stretched hand

   good-by dave he said  good-
by steve ill do the best i can for
you he started across the street and
a passing trolley-car hid him from our
sight

chapter xxii
in an hour or not at all

 co now you comprehend gentlemen
 why every foe of roccas is a
friend of mine the musicians story


the railroad mans magazine

was ended-a story of cold-blooded vil-
lainy persecution and suffering into
which it is not necessary to enter again
he had told it to us in the cheap res-
taurant outside of which the cabman had
stopped

  nothing short of that tragedy of blood
could have held our attention as we sat
there waiting hearing in every sound the
heavy tread of the banker hoping for
his return before he had even had the
time to meet his peril but the musi-
cian had held us fortune had brought
him and his brother years before to pa-
lermo to be befriended there by the dead
luigi bigontina for a while the fates
smiled and then came the crash

  somehow his brother had permitted
himself to be swept into the net of the
mafia-there was at times something to
be said in its favor but not as rocca
ruled it and rocca ruled it absolutely
when the boy learned what was expect-
ed of him he mutinied and to mutiny
against the mafia there is but one end

  in trying to save his brother the vio-
linist had drawn on his own head the
same doom he had escaped it is true
but for the moment only at the au-
vergne with his soul eaten with ungrati-
fied vengeance he had fiddled and lis-
tened

   i was as safe there as anywhere
he said   and a man must live gentle-
men i had only my violin

  the coming of ghedina had thrown
him into a panic only too well justified
but his conversation with rosa the old
servant of the bigontinas had fired all
his lust for revenge as he told us in
the cab he had come back to fight

  so rocca was head of the mafia and
it was the mafia we had been fighting
it was hardly a surprise but it was none
the less appalling i knew something of
sicily and how helplessly it lay in the
grasp of its secret tyrant even if
marshfield returned in triumph with
maria bigontina herself it would not be
victory the shadow would be upon our
lives until the end as it was upon the
musician-and the end was almost in-
evitable it was he who voiced my
thought

   if rocca gets back to sicily we are
as good as dead no one can touch him
there

   he wont get back growled david
between clinched teeth and at that
moment the door of the restaurant
opened peter marshfield had returned
-and returned alone he walked stead-
ily up to us and sat down his face as
rigid as a bronze cast

   get me something to drink he or-
dered  i think i need it

   where- i broke out but marsh-
field waved his hand impatiently

   wait you might as well hear this
from the beginning and it was from
the beginning that he told it to us omit-
ting nothing dwelling on nothing speak-
ing as though he were expounding a
problem of finance

   when he left us he had found his way
without difficulty to jefferson street it
wasa quiet brooklyn street lined with
houses of the better sort and  was
like its neighbors substantial unpreten-
tious uninteresting he walked up the
steps of the stoop and rang he waited
for an answer

  there was no answer and again he
rang still there was no answer then
marshfield pressed his finger against the
button and held it there while the bell
clamored its summons throughout the
house and out into the street

  as usual marshfield had calculated
accurately visitors were unwelcome at
 jefferson street but an obstinate
old gentleman attracting the attention of
the entire neighborhood by his persistent
demand for admission was more so in
an instant a key turned the door was
opened on the chain and a surly face
peered out

  what you want demanded its in-
hospitable owner

   i want to see mr rocca returned
marshfield

   not here and the man attempted
to slam the door he succeeded only in
closing it upon the broad sole of marsh-
fields shoe

    yes he is said that gentleman  i
-know better give him this pard look
sharp now for the fellow was hesita-
ting perplexed by the visitors assurance
 look sharp or it will be the worse for
you when rocca hears of it

  i suppose it was the air which years
of unquestioned authority bestow that
overawed the man muttering something
the spider of palermo



about inquiring within he departed with
the card leaving marshfield with his
foot in the crack of the door the victor
in the first skirmish in a minute or two
the man returned transformed into an
obsequious servant

    will the gentleman please to enter 
he asked swinging wide the guardian
door	

   he escorted marshfield across the hall
to a small reception-room flung open the
door for him and departed in the cen-
ter of the room his hands behind his
back and a forbidding smile on his heavy
lips was signor rocca

   good evening mr marshfield i
had hardly expected this honor

    i had hardly expected to pay it re-
turned marshfield unruffled   but busi-
ness is business mr rocca

    quite so and how did you know that
i was here

  it is my business to know many
things for instance -marshfield delib-
erately drew up a chair and sat down-
 for instance i know why you did not
produce the evidence i demanded

   roccas lips tightened and his eyes nar-
rowed  indeed and why was that 

   for the good reason that you did
not have it i have rocca stepped
between marshfield and the door but the
banker merely followed him with his
eyes  i didnt bring it with me mr
rocca i was not born yesterday

  the italian laughed shortly you
seem rather suspicious mr marshfield
are you in the habit of doing business
with pickpockets

   sometimes answered marshfield
and i can picture the figure of the grim
old man sitting quietly in the chair ga-
zing straight into the scoundrels eyes

  roccas face darkened at the thrust
and he frowned down on his visitor

 did you come here to insult me mr
marshfield that is likely to be a dan-
gerous amusement also i may remind
you that you do not own this evidence
of which you speak

    bosh   the banker crossed his legs
settling back comfortably in his chair as
though for a prolonged session  bosh
you dont own it either the differ-
ence is that i have it and you havent
thats the difference the question is
what are we going to do

   i see roccas face cleared you
come to propose what you call a deal

   i did not come for the pleasure of
your society retorted marshfield and
for a while there was silence in the lit-
tle reception-room

    well said rocca at length and he
walked carelessly away from the door
what do you propose you have seen
the evidence is it satisfactory

   quite there s only one thing
lacking

    ah and what is that  

   the key

   oh  roccas face was fairly
wreathed in smiles as he beamed down
on his visitor  oh you have found
that out the papers arent much with-
out that are they

    no just a little more than the key
without the papers for a minute the
two men eyed each other before the bank-
er went calmly on  under the circum-
stances i think we might as well go back
to where we began

    you see we really have to give this
man paget something he knows too
much not to i dont care about giving
him money so we had better give him
the girl

  the assured impudence of the sugges-
tion was too much even for roccas com-
posure he started forward with an ugly
scowl and raised voice

  what girl what talk is this
paget- he controlled himself with
an effort in front of the chair where
the banker sat impassive you are
crazy mr marshfield he ended with
a belated attempt at a sneer

    oh no merely prudent as you re-
marked neither you nor i own these pa-
pers and paget knows it it would be
awkward if he talked give him the girl
and he wont its all quite simple if
you would scowl less and think more
roccas face was black and his fists
clenched but the outbreak did not come
instead he glared impotently at his vis-
itor in a tumult of indecision that choked
his rage gold was the god he wor-
shiped and marshfield held it out to
him but on the other hand there was
maria surely there was some way to
win and keep both-only at the minute
he could not see it

  peter marshfield read the man as


the railroad mans magazine

plainly as he might have the newspaper
head-lines that told of his latest finan-
cial coup but he said nothing only he
swung his foot idly and waited his gray
eyes relentlessly tearing the mask from
the scoundrel before him

  the italian made up his mind at last
with a forced laugh he turned away
from the banker to lean with outstretched
hand against the wall close to the door

   you are crazy he sneered  i
know of no girl

  nor i of any papers marshfield
rose quickly to his feet in stern com-
mand  dont ring that bell mr roc-
ca you dont dare touch me

  and rocca did not his audacious
eyes met marshfields unflinchingly but
his hand did not press the hidden signal
whose existence the banker had divined
it still lingered there however when he
snarled and why not

   it wouldnt pay said marshfield
quietly  you would lose your abys-
sinian mine and you would get the whole
united states at your heels stephen
paget is an unknown newspaper man
mr rocca he may-disappear with
every girl he ever knew and it is no ones
business but i-well there are men
who know where i have gone and i am
peter marshfield

  roccas hand crept slowly downward
to his side it was perfectly true if
he had touched marshfield he would
have been a hunted man all the rest of
his life it was not worth it the bank-
er nodded his head in satisfaction as he
watched 

   that is better now do you think
you could find this girl if i should sud-
denly discover the papers after that
we might continue the negotiations you
were kind enough to begin with me a
few days ago

   you take a deal of interest in this
girl replied the italian  what is it
to you where she is

   i thought i had told you once said
marshfield wearily  paget is not to
talk now are you going to give her
to me or not

  rocca did not answer at once he
was thinking hard his keen mind striving
to wrench some advantage from this new
situation involuntarily he stepped
across the room to a side window and

looked out marshfields tireless per-
sistent eyes followed looking out too

  beneath the window the ground fell
abruptly away a steep hill tumbling
down to the yards of the river-front
through the dusk shone the lights of a
steamer and a smudge of rising smoke
was dimly outlined against the sky

  rocca turned sharply on his heel  in
an hour he said  if you bring me the
papers i will give you maria bigontina
she is not here but doubtless my friends
will oblige me by bringing her but
they will bring her nowhere but here
therefore you must bring the papers
here

   i am here already answered marsh-
field  one hour is as good as another
give me the girl you have the key al-
ready the rest you can have for the ask-
ing at my office

  the italian shook his head  pos-
sibly  i run no chances bring me the
papers in an hour and come alone be-
sides marie is not here

   oh rot  began marshfield  but
rocca interrupted him with a loud call
 giuseppe the door for this gentleman
in an hour mr marshfield or not at all
-it is my last word

  the burly figure of the doorkeeper
loomed beside my friends father his
errand was over rocca bowed farewell
to him and the door of  jefferson
street was locked behind him

chapter xxiii
drawing the net

as he finished his narrative mr

      marshfield reached across the table
of the little restaurant  give me those
papers steve he said the map and
the deed were in his hands before i
grasped the meaning of his request

  youre not going back i gasped
 theres no faith in the man if you
had had these things the other time you
would never have got away

  old marshfield smiled grimly  quite
right stephen i never would have
nevertheless i am going back excuse
me a minute he stalked to the rear
of the room and we saw him busy in a
telephone-booth

   hes got something up his sleeve
the spider of palermo



muttered david as we watched the gray
head bending over the instrument  i
wonder what the dickens it is

   theres no faith in rocca i re-
peated  we cant let him go back we
oughtnt to have let him go at all

   dont worry about the governor
retorted dave  he knows what hes
up against i wish we knew as well
his father may have known but he
was in no hurry to inform us when he
returned he seated himself again at the
table laying his watch before him with-
out a word once i opened my mouth
to speak but closed it again the least
i could do in gratitude was to respect his
silence

  the strain told however it seemed
as though i could not keep my seat could
not maintain that horrible silence another
second when the door of the restaurant
opened to admit three men they were
all big inclined to corpulence but still
strong and active and endowed with ob-
vious aggressiveness after one quick
glance about the room one of them
stepped up to us

   this is very strange mr marsh-
field he began but the banker cut him
short

   you ought to be used to strange
things inspector we have been wait-
ing for you

   i came quickly enough said the
other and i recognized the gruff tones
at once as those of inspector mccor-
mick the head of the detective bu-
reau  lucky i was in my office its
not every policeman who would chase
over the city for a telephone message
 it wasnt every policeman i was tele-
phoning to retorted marshfield  did
you do as i asked  

  of course snapped the other  i
know my job but what are we up to
now  

   waiting answered marshfield if
you have those guns i asked for you
might -iiand them over to my son and
mr paget here

  mccormick regarded us doubtfully
 this is very unusual mr marshfield
he said  what is this affair 

   ours said the banker curtly  i
dont ask many favors mccormick but
i ask this you wait here half an hour
if im not back by then go round to 

jefferson street and break the place
open until then it is our affair after
that do what you like you know me
will you do it  

    i dont like it mr marshfield-

    neither do i interrupted the bank-
er rising to his feet  but its got to be
done come along you three

   clutching the revolvers the policeman
reluctantly handed to us we followed
him to the street in a daze there he
halted to give us our instructions

   you three go down to the pier by
the steamer and wait in the alley this
fellow told us of in the cab if anybody
comes along stop him i fancy myself
it will be rocca and in a hurry if it
is make him take you to the girl the
police will be round in the neighborhood
somewhere if you need them but i pre-
fer to trust you somebody may have to
think you know good-by

  he was a rod or two up the street
when david sprang after him and
grasped him by the sleeve

   by heaven you shant go  he
cried hoarsely  give me those papers
and let me take them

  wrenching himself free peter marsh-
field wheeled roughly upon his son
 do as youre told he growled  go
fight with your hands and let me fight
with my head

  turning his back upon us he strode
up the street i heard david give a
choking little gasp and there was a
queer lump in my own throat but it was
the violinist who spoke

   he is a brave gentleman come i
will show you the alley

  by a labyrinth of devious byways he
brought us out at length upon the river
close to the uncovered dock where lay
the fruit steamer it was quite dark
now and as far as we could tell there
was no one about to observe us as we
clung to the shadow of a high fence

  far above us many lights marked the
row of quiet houses on the heights be-
tween their solid respectability and this
obscure section of the citys water-front
there seemed no possible connection yet
there was one the fence on our left
stopped suddenly to begin again a pace
or two beyond

  the gap between was the mouth of the
alley which the musician had discovered


the railroad mans magazine

in his midnight prowlings about the for-
tress of his unsuspecting enemies we
dived into it and were swallowed at once
in the dense shadow

  it was too dark to do more than inch
our way slowly forward we felt the
ground rise sharply under our feet and
knew that we were climbing toward the
house but of what lay on either side
we could form no idea the alley was
narrow however when we halted well
up the slope there was no chance for any
one to pass us one exit from  jef-
ferson street was effectually barred

  but what was happening at the en-
trance in the darkness i still saw peter
marshfields broad back as he swung
away from us to he knew not what
there was no faith in rocca and now
he had the papers with him there was
no faidi in rocca how many times i
said that to myself i do not know i
was still repeating it when the words
were driven from my head

  through the blackness above a man
was coming down to us--coming as fast
as the steep slope and slippery path per-
mitted we heard his heavy footsteps
and then a dark form shot in front of
us i dived at his knees as he came
struck them with my shoulder and
with my arms twined about his legs
brought him to the ground a helpless
mass while i clung to him blindly
obeying old marshfields instructions to
stop whoever came from the house david
struck a match in the shelter of his
hands

   by all thats holy it is rocca  he
cried holding the little flame close to
the fallen mans face  get up you 

  grasping the italian by the collar he
dragged him to his feet still dazed by
the violence of his fall  where is
she he snarled speak or ill-
the threat was the more significant for
its not being finished but rocca could
only gasp for breath

   shes on the steamer i breathed in
his ear my very hope warning me to
caution  your father guessed it roc-
cas got the papers and hes trying to
get off himself

  youre right but what then

   this the time had come for the
last chance the last charge of the old
guard that would win or lose it all i

slipped my arm part way through roc-
cas and the muzzle of inspector mc-
cormicks revolver pressed agatnst the
villains side  you feel that mr
rocca thats a pistol march

  the italian did not hesitate he had
seen too many men killed in his life to
count on my possible reluctance to shoot
down a man in cold blood and my
blood was not cold at that moment i
believe i-would have killed him with as
clear a conscience as ever a soldier
fought the battles of his country for
tunately for my future peace of mind it
was not necessary

  we emerged from the alley a little

	knot of men shutting in our captive the
revolver pressed with convincing force
against his side straight across the
street to the pier and up the gangplank
we walked to the deck of the steamer
there we stopped to confront as bewil-
dered a gang of seafaring ruffians as it
has ever been my fortune to behold

    order her up i whispered and the
revolver forced its way still farther into
the folds of his coat

   on the face he turned to me was writ-
ten all the black evil of the man
 you he began but the steel was
jammed against his side and he was si-
lent

  order her up i repeated and
before i count five one-two-three-

   bring the signorina on deck the
voice was thin and broken like the ring
of cracked crockery it was a different
man that david and i held between us
from the suave self-confident host who
had entertained us at luncheon that
morning

  changed though he was the mans
power was still unbroken at the order
one of the least ruffianly of the crew be-
fore us disappeared in the companion-
way the others remained staring at us
in undisguised astonishment

   they could not see the revolver they
did not know who we were and they
must long since have grown accustomed
to the unexpected but certainly they had
been prepared for no such scene as this
standing by the other side of rocca
david took advantage of the pause to
slip his hand unobtrusively into the
scoundrels pocket he drew out a bun-
dle of papers and stuffed them into his
the spider of palermo	

own coat then we stood motionless
waiting

  she came at last at sight of the frail
face even whiter now and more drawn
than when it had first glorified the chill
desolation of washington square the re-
volver in my hand shook it was rocca
who had done this and his life was mine
to take or give i sometimes wonder how
it was that my finger lay quiet on the
trigger

  for a second she stood bewildered at
the change of scene  then catching sight
of the four men who watched her she
sprang back

   no no  and her hands were flung
out as though to blot us from her sight
 not you again  

  the cry struck into my heart in the
joy of battle for her sake i had for-
gotten that it was as roccas friend she
had last seen me that it was as roccas
friend she now saw me standing by his
side on the deck of his steamer even
with death before his eyes the keen ital-
ian grasped something of the situation
the mud-bespattered visage he turned
to me bore a hideous leer

   you see your welcome he jeered
but the next instant his face blanched at
the sudden stab of the revolver it was
not now as it had been in eleventh street
i must play the brute a minute longer
then the nightmare would be at an end

   come here i cried out harshly to
the girl  come here or pietro dies 
her hands dropped and she stared at
me with wide terror-stricken eyes she
could not reason that it was an empty
threat horror had been heaped too
heavily upon her for her to question
new disaster

  slowly reluctantly as though drawn
by an irresistible magnet she crept across
the deck nearer and nearer she came
until my breath stopped in the suspense
of the final moment

  my eye measured the distance she
was within my reach the revolver was
still against roccas side when my left
arm shot out and grasped her

   move and youre dead rocca 

  my shout of triumph rang through
the night as i sprang backward toward
the gangplank maria bigontina within
the circle of my arm the wavering aim
of my weapon mattered nothing planted

like a rock before us stood david marsh-
field his leveled revolver steady in front
of him

  how we staggered down that gang-
plank i do not know-nor did i ever
know only i remember that as i stood
upon the dock i saw david backing
slowly down and the light from the
lamps of the deck shone upon the steel
in his hand

   from the darkness of the alley behind
us came the shrill whistle of a police
signal the sound of running men and
the roar of inspector mccormicks com-
mand  on the steamer men theyre
on the steamer  

  then chaos was let loose above the
inferno of italian shouts and oaths rose
roccas order down with that gang-
plank cast off full speed ahead 

  the gangplank crashed down by our
feet the end of a heavy hawser splashed
into the water the steamer had started
on her way to sicily and safety but
while only a foot or two separated her
from the dock the figure of a slender
man shot abruptly into the center of the
ring about rocca the light fell full
upon his face and we saw that it was
ghedina

    who are you he screamed  to give
us orders clumsy fool you betray
us but once  

  he flung himself straight at his de-
feated chief there was the flash of
steel and the dark form of a man falling
the police found rocca afterward-
flat on his back on the deck of his fruit-
steamer his unseeing eyes turned up to
the stars a knife thrust downward
through his throat under the protruding
sensual jaw

   so die many of the chiefs of the mafia
i am told unquestioned despots while
they reign death is the penalty they ay
for failure

  ghedinas triumph was short - lived
while we stood aghast at the tragedy be-
fore the cavour could gather way a po-
lice-boat dashed out from the shadows
of the neighboring pier there was a
sharp command the crack of a pistol
and then we saw men swarming over the
low sides of the fruiter old peter
marshfield had fought with his head to
good purpose


the railroad mans magazine

  the pier was filled with policemen
now but i did not notice them a hand
fell on my shoulder and i turned to find
him panting beside me

   thank heaven   i gasped  youre
safe  but not even to shake hands
with him would i release my arms from
the prize they clutched so fiercely

   safe of course im safe they
grabbed the papers and gagged me-
thats what i expected you got her i
see  and now i suppose you will think
yourself happy

   i suppose so-i-you-i want to
thank- the silly words stuck in my
throat as i looked from the gray-haired
banker who had wrought this miracle
into eyes that glowed up at me from
a white face  will i    asked ab-
ruptly

  for a second my eyes held hers bla-
zing with a light i could not read she
did not answer the question instead she
lay quiet and inert upon the arm that
pressed her to me she had offered no
resistance as i carried her down the gang-
plank  she offered none now but the
fire flaming in her dark eyes burned its
way into my soul and seemed to lay it
bare before her

  will i i asked again for still she
had not answered

  what do you want she breathed
 why have you done it 

   want  my voice rang through
the noise-filled pier above the commands
of policemen and the shouts of excited
angry men  want i want you-and
i have you now

   with a fierce instinct of protection my
arm tightened about her but this time
she did not yield her slender hands
pushed hard against my breast all her
helpless strength fought me and for
very shame iny arm dropped to my side
i could fight for her- could not fight
against her

  she fell away from me her gaze roam-
ing without comprehension over the sud-
den tumult the pier was thronged
with shouting men between the dock
and the steamer was open water on the
deck of the cavour the clubs of the men
from the police - launch were making
short work of the crew demoralized by
the death of their master and the mu-

the

 tiny of his lieutenant we had won and
 she was free-but she knew nothing of it

   suddenly she drew herself erect in
 tense courage she could not reach the
 steamer-one glance had told her that
 she was a prisoner in my hands and she
 faced me fearlessly

  you betrayed me to rocca now
you have taken me from him and you
have killed my brother

   the blank wonder in the voice was
 that of one who has outlived hope in
 that loud chaos of battle and victory she
 stood alone and undaunted facing the
 end

    your brother is safe with mrs
 noyes i never betrayed you

   i did not recognize the words as my
 own-i hardly knew that i had spoken
 in my head was the conviction that it
 was all a dream that some time we
 would awake and i would find her sit-
 ting before the fire as she had sat that
 first afternoon

    my brother pietro  he is safe 
 the cry brought me sharply to myself
 -but it is impossible

    signorina your brother is in the
 house from which you fled in half an
 hour you will be with him and free

   she stood motionless upon the dock
 her eyes searching mine and slowly i
 saw a new glory arise from their depths

    i almost believe you she mur-
 mured  and oh if i could  

   one step forward and my arms were
 about her  he is safe i breathed in
 her ear and then with the blessed awa-
 kening marshfields last words came to
 me  am i to be happy  i asked

   the long black lashes closed softly
 down upon her cheek  i do not under-
 stand it all whispered maria bigon-
 tina  but i know that i am very happy
 i do not think i ever quite believed it
 for the second time that evening the
 heavy hand of peter marshfield fell on
 my shoulder the banker was still
 standing by my side  but he was not look-
 ing at us and his eyes blinked strangely
 when he turned them at last from the
 lights in the sky-scrapers of manhattan

   if you are going to marry her pa-
 get he muttered gruffly  youll manage
 her property how much will you take
 for that abyssinian stuff

on the editorial carpet

      side-talks with the man who sits in the cab of
      the magazine and is commonly called an editor

just completed our march time-card
therefore we feel that we can load our
think-tank with pride lay back light the
pipe and chew the fat like a bake-head who
has spent half his life on an old wood-
burner

  but any motive-power that can pull along
a train of a few hundred thousand cars such
as we pull every month isnt much like the
woodburners we remember

  we hold all long-distance and tonnage
records and the length of time we keep out
of the repair shops would we think delight
the heart of any master mechanic

  but one thing we must say-it isnt any
cinch we do it because we are always
overhauling and oiling and cleaning and
adjusting and because we use nothing but
the finest oil and the best fuel might as
well quit cold as try to make a limited
schedule on lignite or some kind of grease
that looks like molasses and smells like a
hot box long neglected

  we have just given this february number
the high ball and sent it on its way if any
of the crew deserves a brownie the captain
who sits back here and does the heavy think-
ing wants to know about it-and as quickly
as possible and its up to you boys

  we want particularly to assure you on
these points this month because three of our
splendid serials come to an end in this
number

  maybe you think we talk like a pinhead
who has just been made private secretary
to the g p a if so call us down

  in march we shall start on the trans-conti-
nental run a railroad novel  without
lights it is the story of a young railroad
mans fight in the dark and it is hot every-
where except at the journals its author is
j aubrey tyson

  to take the place of another serial and
by way of a little variety we are going to
run a complete long story about a bear fight
in a western railroad town it is by c w
beels and it is full of the stuff that makes
your mental rails curl up

  in the matter of short fiction we have not
closed the throttle a notch over the febru-

ary speed and this we consider one of the
fastest fiction numbers we have sent out

  we have not neglected humor as you will
admit between laughs when you read  the
man from texas by james francis dwy-
er and the rebate by frank packard
but we have four tense dramatic stories
-one by robert fulkerson hoffman one by
harry bedwell and the others are by new
writers-robert t creel and earl c wight

  riding the rail from coast to coast
slides onto its last rail length next month
and comes to a stop we dislike to state
that the board is placed against this bully
series but we have another series by mr
willets ready to couple onto the train of
his popularity which will haul it over the
steel at the same old gait look out for it

  a clever new series that we hinted at a
month or two ago the evolution of al-
most by horace herr will also start out
in march did you ever see a dog carrying
a dinner-pail thats how proud we are
almost

  e l bacon will tell how a record-break-
ing special is put on for a long run when
some millionaire suddenly decides that he
must cover the ground quickly

  arno dosch will tell of the conquest of
new york by the pennsylvania railroads
new entrance to the metropolis a big
gripping article told in a big way

  we have one of the niftiest yarns for the
true stories series you ever read it is
called  neath the shade of the old water
tank its a bully tale too

  robert h rogers one of the most inter-
esting writers on railroad subjects that ever
steamed into our depot will have a special
 the nerve of the eagle-eye

  we think that our old-timer tales are
going to hit the boys just right the second
one will tell about the famous run of the
jarratt-palmer special back in s when
most of us youngsters were playing with tin
engines tied to strings	-

  but that isnt all its time for us to
throw the jolly switch and get  another
track

  our march number will be like the new

asleep at the switch

some time ago a reader asked us to re-
print the poem asleep at the switch
and another reader has since asked us for
the name of the author we are indebted to
a lady reader for the following copy the
name of the author is george hey as we
stated in this department in the october
number

the first thing i remember was carlo tugging
    away

with the sleeve of my coat fast in his teeth
    pulling as much as to say

 come master awake and tend to the
switch-lives now depend upon you

 think of the souls in the coining train
    and the graves youre sending them to

 think of the mother and babe at her breast
    think of the father and son

 think of the lover and loved one too
think of them doomed every one-

to fall as it were by your very hand into
    yon fathomless ditch

 murdered by one who should guard them
    from harm who now lies asleep at the
    switch

i sprang up amazed scarce knew where i
stood sleep had oermastered me so

i could hear the winds hollowly howling and
    the deep river dashing below

i could hear the forest leaves rustling as the
trees by the tempest were fanned

but what was that noise at a distance  that
    i could not understand

i heard it at first indistinctly like the rolling
     of some muffled drum

then nearer and nearer it came to me and
    made my very ears hum

what is this light that surrounds me and
    seems to set fire to my brain

what whistles that yelling so shrilly oh
god  i know now-its the train 

we often stand facing some danger and
seem to take root to the place

so i stood with this demon before me its
heated breath scorching my face

its headlight made day of the darkness and
glared like the eyes of some witch

the train was almost upon me before i re-
    membered the switch

the switch resisted my efforts some devil
    seemed holding it back

i sprang to it seizing it wildly the train dash-
     ing fast down the track

on on came the fiery-eyed monster and
    shot by my face like a flash

i swooned to the earth the next moment and
    knew nothing after the crash

how long i laid there unconscious is im-
    possible for me to tell

my stupor was almost a heaven my waking
    almost a hell

for i then heard the piteous moaning and

shrieking of husbands and wives

and i thought of the day we all shrink from
when i must account for their lives
mothers rushed by me like maniacs their
eyes staring madly and wild 

fathers losing their courage gave way to
    their grief like a child

children searching for parents i noticed as
     by me they sped

and lips that could form naught but  ma-
    ma  were calling for one perhaps dead

my mind was made up in a second-the river
    should hide me away

when under the still burning rafters i sud-
denly noticed there lay
a little white hand-she who owned it was
doubtless an object of love
to one whom her loss would drive frantic
tho she guarded him now from above

i tenderly lifted the rafters and quietly laid
     them one side

how little she thought of her journey when
she left for this last fatal ride

i lifted the last log from off her and while
searching for some spark of life
turned her little face up in the starlight and
recognized-maggie my wife

oh lord thy scourge is a hard one at
a blow thou hast shattered my pride
my life will be one endless night-time with
maggie away from my side

how often weve sat down and pictured the
    scenes in our long happy life

how id strive through all my lifetime to
    build up a home for my wife

how people would envy us always in our
    cozy and neat little nest

when i would do all of the labor and maggie
     should all the day rest

how one of gods blessings might cheer us
    when some day i perhaps should be
    rich-

but all of my dreams have been shattered
    while i lay there asleep at the switch

i fancied i stood on my trial the jury and
     judge i could see

and every eye in the court-room was stead-
    fastly fixed upon me

and fingers were pointed in scorn till i felt
     my face blushing blood-red

and the next thing i heard were the words

 hung by the neck-until dead

then i felt myself pulled once again and my
hand caught tight hold of a dress

and j heard whats the matter dear jim

     youve had a bad nightmare i guess
and there stood maggie my wife with never
a scar from the ditch-

id been taking a nap in my bed and had not
     been asleep at the switch

bouquets

while we heartily believe in that good
american motto  every knock is a
boost we regret this month that we have
on the editorial carpet	

no knocks from our readers to liven up this
little part of the carpet they are all bou-
quets and they- are pretty fragrant to us
here are what some of the boys say

  h	stielson durham concord cali-
fornia-i have intended writing you for
some time to express my appreciation of the
value of the railroad mans magazine
i have been a reader since your first issue
and always watch the news-stands impatient-
ly for its appearance

  c l baxter cleveland ohio-though
i am not a railroad man i like your maga-
zine very much and get it regularly from
the news-stands

  j p smith reading pennsylvania-
i have been a constant reader of the rail-
road mans magazine for more than two
years it is the best and most classy maga-
zine ever published and contains everything
of interest to railroad men being a tele-
graph operator i find it very interesting
while on duty at night 

  b	c parkfr colton california-i have
never missed a copy of your magazine since
it came out and if it continues as interesting
in the future as in the past i never will

  c	l miller tampa florida-i think
the railroad mans magazine is nearly
perfect and improves with each issue

  p s meacham duluth minnesota-
my sister and i had a scrap about the rail-
road mans magazine this month and the
little kids cry every time we take it away
from them it is the one magazine that can-
not be kicked and the person who makes a
kick about it must have a severe attack of
brainstorm the tonnage it carries is up to
the standard

  george f babb shreveport louisiana-
while i am not expert at throwing bouquets
i think we should  toss a few buds  to ye
editor when we have received so many
from him i have been a regular reader of
the railroad mans magazine from the
first issue and i can say that it has filled a
long-looked-for link in railroad literature

  while i have not guided a hog for over
eight years i sure do appreciate the rail-
road mans magazine for it is railroad
from cover to cover

  while some one-sided readers occasionally
 set your packing out  for you i surely
get the worth of my money while it may
not be as good as the one-sided reader could
do it is better than i could do so i get even
by sitting up late to read my copy

  let the good work go on i remain a satis-
fied jreader of the railroad mans maga-
zine

  f ii cirnns melrose new mexico -
i have been reading your magazine for the
last three years i think it is chock-full of

human nature the contents of each num-
ber are like what the irishman said about
the whisky it is all good and some better

  bert smith tombstone arizona-i am
a constant reader of your magazine and
think it the best

  percy neister richmond virginia-
been a constant reader of your magazine
and now let me register a kick i want it
every week-or twice a month anyhow-as
oncc per is so long to wait may your maga-
zine run for many more years to come dont
try to improve it any more as it is o iv
just give it to us oftener

hauling nitroglycerin

here is an interesting and important
letter from a man who evidently is
in a position to know just what he is talking
about if as he suggests any of our read-
ers want his assistance to further hisidea
we will be pleased to furnish his name and
address  application 

editor the railroad mans magazine

   have been engaged in the manufacturing
and shooting of nitroglycerin for oil-well
purposes for a number of years so i do not
expect recognition from your very popular
railroaders except where human life and
property are at stake

  now i have been a very eager patron at
the news-stands on the tenth of every month
for a year and a half to get t ii railroad
mans magazine as i consider t the most
interesting publication ever put out in your
december number i find an article entitled
the dynamite division by d a stovall
and it recalls a good many similar cases that
have happened in the eastern states some
of which have been mentioned by writers in
your magazine

  as i am a great lover of fair play i be-
lieve those train crews have enough risks
to take without having to handle cars of
dynamite packed as they are there are
plenty of men in their line who would be
willing to show up the cause of these ex-
plosions but who hold back with the fear of
being known as a  butter-in

  now if facts will be the means of stopping
this useless slaughtering of innocent lives i
am willing to accept the above title and
more if need be

  the only cause for those explosions is seep-
age of the nitroglycerin from the absor-
bent caused by too vvarm a temperature being
kept in the car or by the carelessness of the
employees of powder companies in not get-
ting the nitroglycerin equally distributed
with he absorbent or by the compression of
the sticks forcing or squeezing out the gly-
ccrin which comes in contact with the nail-
heads on the boxes or any other iron plates or
holt-heads on the inside of the box cars
	the railroad mans magazine

  this seepage can be stopped by placing
light tin pans  the inside of each case of
dynamite and which should have a depth of
at least one-third that of the case this pre-
caution will hold the seepage from coming
in contact with hard substances the top
of each case should be plainly marked  this
side up

  having taken into consideration that some-
times these cases are smashed open and even
the car upset the danger is almost entirely
eliminated by the glycerin being in its proper
place at the time of the shock the railway
companies or the government could make
the demand for this precaution and get it

  i do not care for notoriety but if any of
your boys should become interested in this
and wish a detailed description of the nature
of this explosive they may get my address
through you and write me personally i as-
sure them that i will do all in my power to
help their cause	x y

 more verse from atlanta

james a crowell the railroad bard
of atlanta author of  oh you ham
first section is again in our midst-as
the real country editor would say he con-
tributes one more heart-touching poem to the
carpet a gentle tribute and plaintive psean to
that much-written much-mooted person the
poor old bo

contented

up on the top mid the sleet and snow

of an east-bound freight lay a poor old bo
his legs were numb his clothes were old
and he could hardly keep his hold

he thought about the birds and bees

and back beneath the maple trees

when he sat with katie by the brook-

the sunshine glowed in every nook

he called her  pet she called him  dear
and they were married in a year

the biscuits that his katie made
he thought of too as there he laid
upon the train so wan and bare

and then thanked heaven that he was there

another old-timer

our good friend e f jackson sends
us a pleasant letter from his home in
florence minnesota in which he refers to
william g king an old-timer mentioned
in our december number mr king began
by braking on the northern central out of
baltimore in 

   i can go him six years better writes
mr jackson  having commenced as a mes-
senger boy in  at appleton wisconsin
i have worn the railroad harness ever since

filling positions as messenger operator sta-
tion-agent track-despatcher and chief des-
patcher

   when i commenced a sound operator
was a rarity we all worked the old regis-
ter the engines were wood burners with
the old petticoat smoke-stacks keyed on ec-
centrics and slipping out of place in some
places the track was made of x wood
with strap iron and snake heads twelve
to fourteen cars was a big train and a
-capacity car was  a large one 

  now who can go farther back than
brother jackson

ballads in demand

a distinctive thing about railroad-
ing a distinction which it does not
share with any other business  land but
in which it resembles the free life of the
seafarer is the way the days work and the
days play lends itself to song there are
considering the comparatively short time
that railroads have occupied the attention of
poets and singers perhaps more songs deal-
ing with the rail than there are dealing with
the sea

  this department has proved that there
is an unending demand for railroad songs
and that there is an unending supply of
them one friend has written asking that
some reader will supply the song  the
train that never rolled in it begins

  i was speeding on the train

  that would bring me back again

to the girl i loved in sunny tennessee

  another reader would like to be supplied
with the words of  life is like a mountain
railroad we also have a request for a

song which begins

on a sunday morning it began to rain
around a mountain came a passengpr-train

  still another reader has asked us fota
poem written by a brakeman who was dis-
charged from the southern railway at
knoxville tennessee several years ago it
begins

tell me not in box-car numbers
life is but ail empty dream

  two bold gentlemen with weird tastes
inform us that they have long been looking
for songs entitled respectively  the hell-
bound train and when billy higgins
used to wiggle his ears if anybody has
seen any of these ballads in the course of
on the editorial carpet



his wanderings and can remember enough
of them to make readable lines when set
down on paper we shall be glad if he will
take his stub of pencil and a scrap of paper
and send them on



the identity of dugan

dugan has owned up we labored with
him long before he would confess in
public he pleaded modesty shame poor
relations and the police-but as we pointed
out to him what is sorrow compared with
the applause of posterity

  he decided to take the applause and can
the sorrow comforting himself with the
hope that perhaps somebody who owed him
money seeing that he was reduced to wri-
ting for a living would repent and send him
a remittance

  with this frank explanation we beg to
announce that in future the author of the
jolly dugan stories will leave the euphoni-
ous shelter of his notn de plume  e flor-
ence and come out under his real name-
augustus wittfeld he is too good a story-
teller to remain unknown

  tf you will turn to the story  dugans
pal goes dippy in this number you will
see that we speak the truth in the letter he
sent us admitting his identity he says

there are dugans at work on every road-
  dugans with yarns worth while

and i trust that the dugan i write about
  will cause the many to smile

his mission on earth is a mission of fun
  may he never be known as a bore

for his object in life is to make two grow
  where only one smile grew before



carpeted again 

editor the railroad mans magazine

 noticed in the december number of
the-railroad mans magazine in an
article entitled  making the lightning hus-
tle that the average speed of an operator
is nine words a minute

  i greatly differ with you on this subject
i am an operator myself and would consider
nine words to the minute very slow for the
average telegraph operator

  most any ham can copy twenty words with
ease and a good operator generally takes
from thirty-five to forty words to the min-
ute surely this must have been a misprint

  i am a regular reader of the railroad
mans magazine and think it simply great
i am not a subscriber but always get a copy
of it each month

  i may be mistaken in my charges but i
know a great many operators and am almost
positive that nine words a minute is far
below the average yours truly

as to our monacher

we have had a great many serious and
puzzling problems put up to us at
various times but here is one that taxes our
gray matter so that the gage is way beyond
the limit

  a reader who evidently has better inten-
tions wants to know why we write young
mens christian association and the rail-
road mans magazine in our editorial
capacity we have done most everything from
telling a tallow-pot how to propose to solv-
ing the modulus of elasticity in steel springs
we have forgotten a good deal about gram-
mar especially that part which relates to the
construction of plurals and possessives and
suchwthings

  so far as we know-mens or mans-it
is simply a matter of choice we could have
called it the railroad mens magazine had
we wanted to but it is our belief that a great
many noted authorities such as goold-
brown and edgar allan poe always held
that the singular was the most forcible and
effective

  however as living examples we refer to
our esteemed sisters the ladies home
journal and the womans home companion

oh you ham

second section

the ham is the most popular man on a
railroad-not in the december num-
ber we published a fine poetic tribute to this
most expert of ear-pounders written by mr
james a crowell that poem met with
approval it inspired the muse of another
gentleman mr e logsden of shawnee
oklahoma who evidently has bitter proof
that the only thing a ham can hit is the hay
-except when he is hitting the pike looking
for another job the result of the inspira-
tion was section two of the ham sandwich
which runs along thusly

this ham he got another job
  on the grand old b  o

and the way that he osd the trains
  was something fierce to know

but as the night passed onward

  from midnight unto dawn

this ham got very sleepy
  and soon began to yawn
	the railroad mans magazine

and soon twas dear old slumberland

that he had drifted to

and how he dreamed and dreamed and
dreamed
from twelve midnight till two

he thought hed been promoted

in an awfully short time

and now he was despatching
on the b  os main line

he dreamed that hed been boosted
in another shorter time

and now he was superintendent
of the b  os main line

and so he still lay dreaming
as the fast express pulled in

the despatcher he was calling-

calling that ham like sin

still he dreamed that he was standing
midst a mighty throng of men

and a big white-headed gent said

 i guess well promote you again

and just as they were drinking
to the health of this king-pin

old humpy boomer brakeman

poked him hard upon the chin

he awoke in awful panic

and he looked around with fright

and he heard the c d calling

their woes in verse

oh ye casting buffer shades of ye
main crank pin hail glorious
injector steam-valve-and all the other
muses but the manner in which every
railroad man from captain to end-shack is
breaking into poetry is enough to make any
man in an editorial cab yell for the binders

just as we were drawing the fires and
locking the old steamer up for the night
just as we were picking up our dinner-
pail and starting home along came a bunch
of letters from the boys telling us about
their troubles and-holy headlamp -tell-
ing them in verse

we began reading them we wish we
might print them all but we have only space
for one here on the last page the author
is w c deuel of birmingham alabama
he says

they started us out the other am
with a little old engine leaking and in very
poor condition to tackle the day ahead of us
we were disgusted when she came to the
cab-track

the engineer the brakeman the fireman
and myself gave voice to some of the state-

ments in the following verses in which the
meter changes without notice and the rime
at will but they express our opinion of the
machine we had to do business with that day

 your november number eulogizes the
  tallow-pot in a well-written piece of poet-
 ry the engineer suggested i write up the
  and send the result to you so this crime
 is as much  him as  any one else and
 we know you will picture that deal we were
 up against that day as probably your experi-
 ence has thrown you in a like dilemma

 we respectfully submit our  to you

 the 

  what engine have you   the operator
     sked	

 as we rolled into c s

  my boy you must have been in the hay
 or youd have heard n b o s

 the engine we have is a la-la my lad

 shes the pride of the hills and dales

 but the poor old girl has seen better nights
 and weathered many hard north gales

 they built her way back  befo de war
 she has served them faithfully too

 the men that have run her and filled her
      with coal

 would number far more than a few

 i recall the day in my box career
 when she was mentioned as  big

 she was a real consolidator-

 sometimes we called her a pig

 but that day has floated into the past
 and will come this way no more

 engines like her are now counted out
 with a tag for the beautiful shore

 shell pull her tonnage down any old hill
 and pop like a fiend gainst her blower
 she oertook a snail-twas dead they aver
 so say the  old heads that know er

 she bucks like a broncho kicks like a mule

 the head brakey wont stay inside her

 i	never saw anything quite so tough
 as this flat-wheeled rough rider

 baldwin built her and a bald one she is

 likewise a tartar a pippin-

 shell delay the game pulling a sand-pit

 if she aint blowin up shes slippin

 she is so antiquated and useless now
 that whenever i discuss her

 well i accent that last syllable
 so hard that it ought to bust her

 but enough of this airy fairy talk

 ive got her and ive got to go
 over and benevolently assimilate
 the coke ovens at d o

 tell that third x to fix er

the greatest home charm

warm and comfy to talk
things over with your guest
if the home is steam or
hot-water heated and
ventilated by

common hospitality demands a warm home

heart confidences-the pearls of friendship-are born only where
there is warmth and coziness ideal boilers and american
radiators help so greatly to give a home its greatest charm-perfect
freedom day and night to enjoy every nook and comer of it no matter
how blizzardy the weather ideal boilers circulate their soft
warmth for hours after the fire in the boiler has been banked for the
night and the house is kept cozy for the rising time and breakfast hour
on the single charge of coal put in the evening before

advantage  burning coal liberates certain gases which burn readily and
make intense heat if permitted to take fire the chambers and the flues opening

out of thesespaces are so arranged in ideal boilers that
they bring in the exact amount of air required
for completely burning these gases as fast as
freed from the coal there can be no undi-
gested coal-every ounce of fuel is made to
yield its utmost heat-none of its heat-making
power is wasted up the chimney

holstein milk

for both mother and baby

if you have a new baby of course you will nurse it for
remember there is nothing as good for the baby as
mothers milk

if you will drink the milk of the large vigorous holstein
cow you cannot help imparting vitality to baby as well as
gaining strength yourself this seems a simple way to
get strong try if it cosls little and you will find your-
self gaining rapidly as well as your baby

if you do not nurse your baby drink holstein milk
yourself and get your physician to tell you how to modify
it for baby if baby is well and strong the milk will
probably not need modifying nearly all milk supply
stations laboratories sanitariums hospitals etc use
holstein milk exclusively for infant and invalid feeding
many of them have their own herds of holsteins

what is navy training worth to you

 in learning to care for and operate the scores of battleships cruis-
 ers and torpedo boats of the navy the bluejackets undergo
 systematic training which results in promotion and increased pay so
 perfect has this system been made that only a few each year out of
  enlisted men fail to advance much of the training is techni-
 cal and makes men proficient in the trades-more proficient than the
 average man gets to be in a large plant ashore in the same period-
 four years

   even the routine duties have been planned as far as possible to fit
 the bluejackets for more difficult and more important work

   the navy does not want the bluejacket to leave the service at the
 end of four years because he has become proficient last year j per
 cent who were entitled to re-enlist returned to the service doesnt
 this prove that the bluejackets training is worth a lot to himself and
 that the navy appeals to him as a good proposition

   look for the address of the navy recruiting office in the want columns
 of your sunday papers if you dont find it write for illustrated booklet
 describing duties pay privileges etc and learn how and where to apply

a living from poultry

 from  hens in ten months
on

to the average poultry-
nian that would seem
impossible and when we
tell you that we have
actually done a 
poultry business with 
liens  a corner in the
city garden  feet wide
by  feet long we are
simply stating facts it
would not be possible to
get such returns by any
one of the systems of
poultry keeping recom-
mended and practiced by
the american people
still it is an easy matter
when the new

philo
system

is adopted

the philo system is unlike all other
ways of keepinc poultry

and in many respects just the reverse accomplishing things in poul-
try work that have always been considered impossible and getting
unheard-of results that are hard to believe without seeing

the new system covers all branches
of the work necessary for success

from selecting the breeders lo marketing- the product it tells how
to get eggs that will hatch how to hatch nearly every egg and how
to raise nearly all the chicks hatched it gives complete plans in
detail how to make everything necessary to run the business and at
less than half the cost required to handle the poultry business in any
other manner

two pound broilers in eight weeks

are raised in a space of less than a square foot to the broiler almost
without any loss and the broilers are of the very best quality bring-
ing here three cents per pound above the highest market price

our six-months-old pullets are laying
at the rate of  eggs each per month

in a space of two square feet for each bird no green cut bone of
any description is ted and the food used is inexpensive as compared
with food others are using

 our new bctok the philo system of poultry keeping gives
full particulars regarding these wonderful discoveries with simple
easy-to-unaerstand directions that are right to the point and  pages
of illustrations showing all branches ot the work fromstart to finish

dont let the chicks die in the shell

  one of our secrets of success is to save all the chickens that are
fully developed at hatching time whether they can crack the shell
or not it is a simple trick and believed to be the secret of the
ancient egyptians and chinese which enabled them to sell the
chicks at  cents a dozen

chicken feed at  cents a bushel

our book tells how to make the best green food with but little
trouble and have a good supply any day in the year winter or sum-
mer it is just as impossible to get a large egg yield without green
food as it is to keep a cow without hay or fodder

our new brooder saves  cents on
each chicken

no lamp required no danger of chilling overheating or burn-
ing up the chickens as with brooders using lamps or any kind of
fire they also keep all the lice off the chickens automatically or
kill any that may be on them when placed in the brooder our
book gives full plans and the right to make and use them one
can easily be made in an hour at a cost of  to  cents

    dear sir-i just want to tell you of the success i have had
with the philo system in january  i purchased one of your
philo system books and i commenced to hatch chickens on the
third day of february  i succeeded in hatching ten chicks i
put them in one of your fireless brooders and we had zero weather
we succeeded in bringing through nine  one got killed by accident
on tune  one of the pullets laid her first egg and the most re-
markable thing is she has laid every day since up to thepresent

my dear mr philo-i want to tell you how pleased i am with my
use of the philo system during the past year the fowls laid
exceptionally well in the new economy coop much better in pro-
portion than those in my old style house the fireless brooder has
solved the problem for me of raising extra early chicks i am going
into your methods more extensively this coming vear wishing you
success i am sincerely yours	rev e b templer

mr f r philo elmira n y	south briai conn april  

    dear sir-i have followed your system as close as i could the result is a complete
success if there can be any improvement on nature your brooder is it the first
experience i had with your system was last december i hatched  chicks under
two hens put them as soon as hatched in one of your brooders out of doors and at
the age of three months i soid them at c a pound they then averaged  - lbs
each and the man i sold them to said they were the finest he ever saw and he wants
ail i can spare this season	yours truly	a e nelson

    dear sir-no doubt you will be interested to learn of our success m keeping
pou try by the philo system our first years work is now nearly completed it has
given us an income of over  from six pedigree hens and one cockerel had
we understood the work as well as we now do after a years experience we could easily
have made  from the six hens in addition to the profits from the sale of
pedigree chicks we have cleared over  running our hatchery plant consisting
of  cycle hatchers we are pleased with the results and expect to do better the
coming year with best wisheswe are very truly yours mrs c p goodrich
