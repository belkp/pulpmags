we ran into a driving
rainstorm i couldnt fly over it

i didnt have proper instru-
ments for flying through it so
the only thing to do was to get down
low and keep visual contact with the water but
it kept getting darker the rain fell harder and
harder till we couldnt see the water below us

i handed my big eveready five-cell flashlight to
the fellow in the co-pilots seat told him to hold
it out the window and flash it below

  and there was the sea only four feet be
low us those long pacific rollers were almost lapping at the wheels my heart
skipped a beat to think how i had brought five people within inches of their
doom certainly it was the power of those eveready fresh dated batteries
tht saved us all and that kept us safe above the sea for the next half hour till
the storm lifted you can take it from me igms

thousands now play who
never thought they could

read this typical letter
from one of our students

 es just like thousands of others who thought
  music was hard this man srot the surprise of iis
 life when he tried this easy way to learn music at
 home and no wonder instead of months of tedious
 study and practice he found himself actually playing
 real tunes in the very first few weeks he didnt be-
 lieve it was possible-and his friends could hardly
 believe their cars when they heard him

  but read this unsolicited letter for yourself he writes
  i ordered your piano course junt to have somethin
  to do to pass the time evenings when i was home i
  didnt even dream that i eouid actually learn to
  play without a teacher because i had always heard
  that it couldnt be done i couldnt afford a teacher
  so i didnt think it would do me any harm to take
  your course

  when  received the lessons i took the instantaneous

  rote finer and etruck the noto right off i con-
  sidered this just killing time but you can imagine
  my surprise when after three or four weeks i found
  that i could actually play real tunes something 
  would never have believed possible without previous
  knowledge of music

  now when i play for people they will hardly believe
  that i learned to play so well with just a correspond-
  ence course in so short a time

  i am getting now to the point where even the hard-
  est music holds no terrors for me any person who
  takes your piano course and studies it cannot help
  but learn to play because it covers everything they
  could ever want to know on the subject

this atom- earth

   a guest editorial
   by ray cummings

                famous scientifiction author

have you ever seen a man strutting
with his own importance one of those
fellows bursting with the consciousness of
his tremendous knowledge you gaze at
him perhaps with amusement he reminds
you of oliver goldsmiths lines

and still they gazed and still uielr wonder

    grew

that one small head could carry
    all he knew

  perhaps if you come to think
of it were all a little like that

to each mans consciousness
himself is the center of the
universe thats a natural
human feeling and this earth
of ours is quite a big place it
has lots of acres of land and
quite a few leagues of ocean

justifiably were proud of the
wonders we put here on earth
we gaze around and were mon-
arch of all we survey

  but its nothing to get puffed up about
pseudo-scientific fiction demonstrates that
to us very clearly now i think that the
last thing in the world that pseudo-scientific
fiction is designed to do is to point a moral
yet from it one may glean many great moral
truths if by any chance you are a fellow
wondering how one small head can carry
all you know give a thought to a fish

  doubtless to a fishs consciousness him-
self is the center of the universe there is
a little gray blur of water which he thinks
is about all of everything that exists unless
he jumps momentarily out and sees a few
trees on the bank of the stream or if he

ray cummings

swallows a fish-hook which hurts and puz-
zles him-until death relieves him of the
puzzlement

  it seems to me that were all very much
like that our telescopes show us spiral
nebulae maybe a trillion light-years away
and we pat ourselves on the back because
we can see so much but isnt that like the
fish who saw the trees isnt
it more probable-as pseudo-
scientific fiction depicts-that
our earth the solar system
all the stars and remote ne-
bulae-that all of it is just a
group of tiny whirling elec-
trons within the atom of some
gigantic world a being on
that other world might be
walking on a beach that beach
would have a lot of grains of
sand-and just one grain would
have a trillion-triluqn atoms
just one atom of which would
hold the iant distances of all
our celestial universe

  that being balancing that grain of sand
on the end of his thumb if you could imag-
ine that he would bother to think of us at
all certainly would indeed wonder what we
had to be puffed up about

  thats just one of the things that all we
followers of pseudo-science fiction realize
fully of course its all very simple to us
as a matter of fact because we read avidly
and understanding this greatest of all
types of fiction we are in truth just a little
above other mortals in the intelligent under-
standing of many many things we all know
that of course

  and come to think of it thats something
to get puffed up about

ancestral voices

philip crain had no pre-
monition on this october sun-
day evening of the strange
chance that was about to hurl him into
unparalleled adventure he had
called at the apartment of dr john
martin simply because the geologist
and his daughter were the only friends
the lonely young engineer had made
since he had come to new york

   crain had been lonely all his life
 that was partly due to the odd mys-
 tery that had always clung about him
 the strange something in his brain that
 had set him apart from other men
 and partly he knew it was due to the

space to steal the oceans of earth




startling stories

alien quality of his physical appear-
ance

  his tall rangy figure and his lean
dark face were not unusual but his
eyes were of a deep blue-black shade
that most people found disturbingly
strange and his hair was of that same
queer blue-black

  as he sat now beside dr martin
watching kay martin and scott ful-
ton red-headed young airplane pilot
dancing to the radio music crain was
wishing wistfully that he could join
in their youthful gayety

  the music from the radio suddenly
died and was replaced by an announc-
ers excited voice we interrupt our
program for a special news bulletin
ladies and gentlemen

  whats happened now wondered
john martin

  perhaps its another european cri-
sis crain suggested

  darn it we just got that orches-
tra a minute ago kay martin was
complaining disappointment on her
vivid pretty face

  but it may be important news her
father said listen-

 the announcers voice was now
rushing excitedly from the radio

  -and so it appears that the meteor
that fell tonight is not a meteor at
all but some kind of projectile a
ship from space it seems impossi-
ble but it may be true we will con-
tinue to bring you news bulletins on
it at frequent intervals

  kay looked startled a ship from
space do you suppose-

  its probably some kind of hoax
said john martin his massive face
thoughtful theres not much like-
lihood of    why philip whats
the matter

  philip crain was utterly rigid his
dark eyes dilated and fixed in a hyp-
notized stare upon the radio he sud-
denly realized that and relaxed with
a shaky sigh his whole body was
trembling

  philip whats wrong kay ex-
claimed

  i-i dont know he said bewil-
dered when i heard that announce-
ment it was as though i started to
remember something-something ive
been trying to remember all my life

they stared at him puzzled and
crain flushed but every fiber of
his brain was throbbing with queer
excitement that radio announce-
ment-it had somehow stirred to
quickened life the shadows in his
mind that had haunted him since boy-
hood as crain fought to appear calm
the announcers voice came again in
an excited shout

  the projectiles end is opening-
creatures coming out creatures from
space theyre using strange weap-
ons-theyre invading earth-

  a wild ringing shout burst from
philip crains lips a bull roar ut-
terly unlike his usual diffident voice

  his blue-black eyes were blazing
and his white face was the hard harsh
face of a stranger his whole body
was quivering his fists clenched

  philip cried kay terrified

  her scream broke the spell the
blazing madness fled from his dis-
tended eyes and he stood shaking
his brow damp with sweat his eyes
wild

  frantic anxiety was on kays face
as she clutched his arm scott ful-
ton was staring at him startled and
john martin was rising astonish-
ment was on the geologists face

  the radio announcers voice sud-
denly shattered the scene to common-
placeness

  you have been listening to our
regular sunday evening play-

  a play i knew it scott fulton
exclaimed ill bet it caused panic
in lots of places

  philip what on earth made you
shout like that kay cried that
bellowing voice and the way you
glared and shook your fist you
looked like a different man

  crains eyes stared hauntedly at
them out of depths of pure misery

  i dont know what made me do it
kay he whispered unless- the
dull aching misery in his white face
was raw quivering as he met their
gaze ive been afraid all my life
he muttered dully that theres some-
thing wrong with me mentally now
this-

  nonsense declared john martin
forcefully you just let yourself get
too excited by this fake radio an-
the prisoner of mars



nouncement philip and lost your
head for a moment thats all

  it didnt make you people lose your
heads crain reminded heavily but
i-ive always feared that i inherited
a queer mental taint

  you mean said the geologist sur-
prised that your parents were not
normal 

a son-myself and he never remem-
bered anything about his past he
died five years ago-without remem-
bering

  a sick agony was in philip crains
voice as he concluded

  so many times ive seen my father
sitting staring trying to remember
and he couldnt it was a shadow

  my father wasnt crain answered
dully people thought him a little
crazy you see he didnt know who
he was

  crains haunted eyes looked brood-
ingly into the past he spoke in a
slow heavy voice

hirty years ago some hunt-
ers up in the canadian wilder-
ness south of hudson bay found a
crazed man wandering in the wilds
a giant of a man naked exhausted
starved and near death from a bad
wound on his head he knew noth-
ing remembered nothing-not even
his own name not even a word of any
language his mind was an utter
blank

  they took him to the nearest trad-
ing post and the priest there cared
for him taught him how to speak eng-
lish and give him the name of john
crain in time john crain came to
the united states married and had

on his life and its been a shadow on
my life too for ive feared that i
have inherited fathers-queerness
ive always felt somehow that there
were important things that i ought to
remember and yet couldnt some-
times when something has excited me
as this radio hoax did tonight ive
seemed on the very verge of remem-
bering i cant get those shadowy
things out of my mind

 crains deep eyes were almost
pleading as he looked up at them

  do you think its because im-
queer mentally he whispered id
rather be dead than that

  philip no kay cried youve
just brooded too long about your fa-
ther

  kays right declared john mar-
tin philip you should have told us
about this long ago wed have made
you see what nonsense it is

  there is not a chance in the world
that your father was mentally defec-


startling stories

tive philip john martin said em-
phatically amnesia generally a re-
sult of shock mut have been what
happened to your father but it is
not a form of insanity and it could
not be passed down from father to
son

  then why is it crain cried that
all my life i too have felt as though
there is something i cant remember
its all unconscious imitation on
your part-imitation of your father
martin declared you saw him try-
ing to remember his past and it made
you think you had something you
couldnt remember

  i wish i could believe you crain
muttered but if i were really nor-
mal why should i have lost my head
when that radio hoax startled me
philip this obsession would leave
your mind if you knew who your fa-
ther really was john martin de-
clared earnestly its just that old
mystery preying on your mind thats
unsettled it

  but i dont know philip crain
said hopelessly and theres no way
of finding out

  did you ever go up there to can-
ada where your father was found
and try to get a clue to his identity
the geologist asked

  no but father went up there
twice and he couldnt find anyone up
there who had ever seen him or heard
of him before he was found in the
forest

  but you could comb the wilder-
ness country and remote posts better
than your father was able to by air-
plane travel martin persisted

for the first time there was faint
hope on crains white face

  do you really think theres any
chance of learning something he
asked earnestly

  of course i do john martin de-
clared and whats more kay and
i will go with you weve been plan-
ning a northern vacation this fall and
it will fit in fine

  dad i was hoping youd suggest
that j exclaimed kay her brown eyes
shining

  say count me in on this party
put in scott fulton ive got a va-

cation coming too and we can all go
up there in my plane

   scott thats fine of you to do this
for us declared kay happily

  for you repeated the grinning
pilot im thinking of the swell fish-
ing up there

  black hopelessness swept back on
philip crain for a moment it was all
so futile to try solving a mystery
thirty years old yet if he only could
solve it-

  those shadowy half-memories in
his brain made him suddenly strangely
eager for this quest to attain some-
thing he dimly felt had lain up in that
far northland for years something
mysterious and tremendous that was
waiting up there-waiting for him

        chapter ii
        mystery wreck

ffoeres the place scott ful-
mm ton called over the motor
roar down there east of those river
forks

  the place where john crain had
been found philip crain gazed
tensely down

  the vast forest of northern que-
bec that lay below in the morning
sunlight stretched limitless as a
shaggy sea a whispering dark green
immensity of hemlock and pine the
nearest trading post was two hours
flight to the south how had his fa-
ther come into this remote wilder-
ness naked and wounded from
where had he come

   crain felt hopelessly that this was
his slim last chance this visit to the
remote wilderness spot where his fa-
ther had been found

   there may be some clue there the
geologist had insisted but in his own
mind crain had felt that the mys-
tery would never be solved-the shad-
ow on him would never be lifted

  his mind took him back to nights
when he had seen his fathers giant
figure standing dark and motionless
outside the house staring yearningly
up at the glittering sky as though try-
ing to read in the heavens the secret
the prisoner of mars



of his identity he remembered times
when john crain in the midst of work
or play would suddenly stop and
stare in baffled wistful perplexity as
though he had been reminded of some
other life some other existence re-
minded of-what

 look theres something down
there kay suddenly cried excitedly
there

  crain saw it his heart jumped it
was a dull-gleaming crumpled metal
bulk lying at the bottom of a small
wooded ravine

 some sort of crumpled metal
wreck crain cried

  well investigate then declared
john martin that ravines only a
dozen miles from where they found
your father this may mean some-
thing

  scott fulton had already spotted a
tiny lake where he could land the am-
phibian in ten minutes they were
backtracking through the forest to-
ward the wreck

  dont build up too big hopes on
this philip advised the geologist
it may be nothing at all

  i know answered crain yet his
dark eyes were vibrant with new hope

  the giant pines and hemlocks had
choked out underbrush and they
walked in the solemn cathedral shad-
ows of the huge trunks upon a yield-
ing carpet of dead pine needles the
air was chill with the nip of fall

  but the narrow ravine was filled
with saplings and brush their
clothes were torn and they were out
of breath by the time they climbed
down into it and started forcing their
way along the bottom of the ravine

  in five minutes scott fulton yelled

  there it is ahead

  a dull-gleaming crumpled silvery
bulk was showing through the dense
brush and saplings

  philip crain crashed forward his
heart pounding with excitement the
others were close on his heels they
all stopped short as they reached the
metal bulk

 what a crack-up fulton ex-
claimed

  its no airplane as i supposed
john martin said his brows knitted
but what is it

crains eyes were brilliant as he
stared at the wreck-for now the
shadowy half-memories in his brain
were stirring and seething wildly
this atrange-looking wreck seemed
somehow familiar to him

  it had been he saw a cylindrical
metal craft twenty-five feet in diam-
eter and sixty feet long but the
whole front half of it had been
smashed by terrific impact the rear
part of the silvery ship was more in-
tact

  this things has been here for
years john martin declared see
how the saplings have grown up
through the wreckage in that front
part

  it looks to me like one of the freak
airships they used to build back in
the early days of flying scott fulton
affirmed plenty of weird ones were
tried then

  that would date this at thirty
years or so ago if youre right mar-
tin said thoughtfully

  and it was thirty years ago that my
father was found wandering near
here philip crain cried excitedly

  the geologist nodded if your fa-
ther was in this thing when it crashed
that accounts for the wound on his
head the shock that snapped his mem-
ory

  then maybe we can find in this
wreck some clue to who my father
was crain cried eagerly

  he was already moving excitedly
around the wreck trying to find en-
trance in a moment he found a door
in the undamaged rear of the craft he
climbed in quickly

  the others followed they found
themselves in a corridor leading to-
ward the stern it was littered with
pineneddles dry leaves and dust that
the winds had blown in it ended in
a wide metal door without knob or
key

  the whole darned ship is of solid
metal fulton marveled no won-
der the blamed thing crashed

  its an extremely light and strong
metal said john martin fingering
a fragment of it he had picked up
whoever designed this ship must
have known a few things

  crain paid no attention he was


startling stories

reaching up and pressing a plate
above the closed door the door slid
open

  how did you know that was the
way to open it philip kay asked in
astonishment

  crain stopped queerly chilled by
realization how had he known

  i dont know he said bewildered-
ly i just seemed to remember-

  scott fulton was staring beyond
the open door he uttered an excla-
mation

  what the devil is this thing

  the whole rear of the ship had been
a single metal chamber it had ap-
parently been designed to hold in a
shock-absorbing framework of heavy
girders a large machine

  it was a mechanism of grotesque un-
familiarity its most striking feature
was a disk-shaped platform of thick
milky crystal ten feet in diameter
and standing on foot-high insulators
underneath the crystal disk was a web
of wires connected to the apparatus
which was grouped around it

six objects like big beehives
wound with silvery wires nd
each topped by a crystal ball were set
at equidistant positions around the
crystalline platform at one point
on the edge of the platform rose a
metal switchboard bearing a row of

eight turn-switches a bright red but-
ton and a cluster of small glass bulbs

  directly above this switchboard
hung a large black metal cone hol-
low its base pointing downward to-
ward the disk of crystal

  what is it kay exclaimed

  ive no idea her father answered
frowning ive never seen an appa-
ratus or machine like this

  philip crain did not hear them he
was staring at the mechanism with his
blue-black eyes wide brilliant with
excitement this machine-he vague-
ly remembered it

  he had no memory of what its pur-
pose was but something seemed to
tell him that the mechanism was of
vast importance something upon
which colossal things depended and
with which he was connected

  lets get it out of here into the
open and try to find out how its op-
erated he cried if we can find out
the nature of this apparatus that will
inform us as to the purpose of this
old airship expedition we can then
try to find out where such an expedi-
tion started from thirty years ago and
who was in it

  john martins massive face was
doubtful but can we get the thing
out philip he demurred

  those doors are all wide crain
pointed out obviously they were
made so to facilitate getting this ma-
chine in and out with a little effort
we can get it out

  seeing the eagerness in crains face
john martin assented

  very well well do it kay you
might look around for papers or any-
thing like that

  there began a period of arduous
toil they cut saplings trimmed
them and used them for skids and
levers with which to force the heavy
squat mechanism out of the wreck
by the time they finally had it out
and resting in a little grassy clear-
ing it was late afternoon

  scott fulton grunted with relief
glad thats over now im going to
give the wreck itself the once-over
while you fiddle with this do-funny
kay with a troubled glance at
philip crain accompanied the pilot
when they returned an hour later
the prisoner of mars



crain was still fascinated with his ex-
amination of every detail of the queer
machine

  i cant understand the design of
that craft fulton told them puzzled
there are big tubes running the
whole length that might have been ex-
haust tubes or rocket tubes but who
ever heard of rocket experiments
thirty years ago

  john martin shook his head frown-
ing everything about this wreck is
queer i wish i understood it

  have you found out what this ma-
chine is for and how it works ful-
ton asked

  philip crain turned his excited face
up to them no we havent yet the
thing is a complete mystery but we
did find out something

he rose and stepped upon the
crystal disk and pointed to the
red button on the switchboard

  see theres a tiny silver hand on
the board pointing to that button
put there i believe as a reminder that
the button was to be pushed first when
the machine was put into operation
were going to try it out

  i dont like this thing kay said
suddenly her brown eyes solemn and
distrustful it looks so-alien

  but crain had already eagerly
jabbed the red button inward it
caught with a click

  two little red lights flashed alive
on the switchboard and a slow
humming came from the beehive ap-
paratus around the desk

  martin and philip crain stared
amazedly at the humming beehive
things

  wheres it drawing power from
the geologist muttered in astonish-
ment it must have some self-con-
tained source of power yet theres
nothing in it that looks like a bat-
tery

  the apparatus hummed on but
there was no other change crains
face showed his deep disappointment

  there must be some purpose to
the thing he exclaimed

  the shadowy half-memories in his
mind were loud strong as he stared
at the machine they seemed whis-
pering pleading begging him to do

something with this mechanism some-
thing for which it had been designed
something vitally important

  if the thing is purposeless he at
last said slowly then we cant-

  it happened at that moment an
overwhelmingly unexpected thing
that smote his lips to silence

  a voice shouted from the hollow
cone above the switchboard a shrill
emotion-laden voice choking with ex-
citement rising to a scream

  tharkol called that shrill voice
wildly tharkol ryaa rire

  they stared at each other faces
white in the dusk from the cone the
trembling shrill voice called on
tharkol tharkol

  shrill quavering voice of an old
man calling as though from far
away with wild superhuman emo-
tion

chapter iii
voice from the void

john martin was the first to
speak

  this thing embodies a radio of
some sort he declared but who is
calling us that wasnt any language
i ever heard of and i know many
startling stories

  tharkol is a name crain ex-
claimed i seem to have heard it and
that language before

  crains tall figure was quivering
his black eyes brilliant that voice
that strange language he had almost
understood them and the name
tharkol had for an instant plucked
with strong fingers at a fiber of his
brain

  again the excited emotion-charged
voice shrilled from the cone

 tharkol su dandor dandor

  dandor must be his name philip
crain cried hes expecting an an-
swer

  with swift impulse crain stepped
forward and shouted loudly up into
the hollow cone

  philip crain speaking who are
you where are you calling from

  silence then there was no an-
swer as the minutes went by

  the thing must not be able to
transmit fulton muttered finally
your call didnt get through

  abruptly contradicting him he
aged voice came shrilling from the
cone it was puzzled now still quiv-
ering with frantic excitement

 krayn it repeated feejip
krayn

  he doesnt understand english
exclaimed crain ill try other lan-
guages

  philip crain speaking he called

again and repeated it in spanish and
french john martin added transla-
tions in five other languages

  they waited again there was a
long silence of minutes before the an-
swer came from the cone

  krayn repeated the aged voice
more puzzled now quir tharkol
su dandor

  he didnt understand any language
we used crain cried thats unbe-
lievable

  theres something a lot more un-
believable about this john martin
said pale and stunned have you no-
ticed how long it has taken each time
for our message to reach this dandor
whoever he is and for his to get back
more than ten minutes each way

  so what fulton said uncompre-
hending

  but philip crain understood and
he stared frozenly at the geologist

  that- its impossible he ex-
claimed

  whats impossible kay asked
anxiously

  her father explained radio sig-
nals travel with the speed of light-a
hundred and eighty thousand miles a
second yet they take more than ten
minutes to reach this dandor and
more than ten minutes to come back
from him he must be more than a
hundred million miles from us

  a hundred million miles re-
peated scott fulton incredulously
why theres no place- he stopped
his jaw dropping a look of awe came
into his face you mean-another
planet another world

  the planet mars is more than a
hundred million miles from earth
right now john martin said a little
thickly

 mars cried kay dad you
cant mean-

stricken to silence their eyes
turned up toward the heavens in
which the glittering hosts of the stars
shone calmly bright and philip
crain felt wild tumult inside his
breast as though after all these
years dim certainty was crystalizing
in him

  yes mars he whispered that
voice is from there i know it
the prisoner of mars



  but this machine this radio or
whatever it is couldnt have come
from there scott fulton objected
incredulously how could it come to
earth

  you said the wrecked airship has
rocket tubes muttered john martin

  you mean its a rocket ship that
came here thirty years ago from
mars fulton exclaimed

  kay martin was gazing at crains
brilliant eyes and transfigured face

  philip she whispered if your
father was really in that ship if it was
the wreck of its landing that wounded
him and caused his amnesia then he
came from-

 good god john martin was
shaken as he stared at crain your
father couldnt have come from there
philip

  i dont know crain said in a
heavy whisper but that radio hoax
about space ships landing-why did
that excite me so why did it al-
most make me remember - some-
thing

  oh this is all crazy scott ful-
tons voice was a little raw the idea
that your father could have come from
that world out there

  listen crain said suddenly

  the voice the shrill aged voice of
dandor was coming again from the
cone above their heads

  krayn feel ip krayn

  calling to them across unthinkable
gulfs of space from far out in the
starry heavens

  su dandor it called quir thar-
kol

  then began a period unreal as a
dream a time in which for hour after
hour philip crain called back and
forth to that aged voice of the entity
that called itself dandor strange
baffled attempts at understanding each
other and a strange feeling in
crain that he could almost understand
dandors speech he felt nothing but
the feverish urge to understand that
shrill voice with its terrific appeal to
him to understand

  listen crain ordered excitedly

  dandor was sending bell notes
through to them now clear liquid
tones one after another until eight
of them had sounded

  and then dandors voice calling
loudly a hi nan zor xel kuru
wee fin oro

   again the eight bell notes and then
the eight strange monsyllables

  the numbers from one to eight in
his language muttered john martin
thats clear enough-but why
the eight switches on the control-
board of this machine cried crain
suddenly thats what hes trying to
tell us about

  zor dandor called urgently from
the cone zor feelip krayn-zor
three-the third switch crain
shouted hes telling us in what or-
der to turn on these switches so as to
put this machine into operation

his hand flew toward the third
switch but john martin
grasped him and dragged him back

   we cant go into this thing blindly
philip he protested we still dont
know this machines purpose

  crains eyes were blazing with ex-
citement but that old man - hes
pleading with us-has some great pur-
pose that we dont understand
philip martin declared we
mustnt go ahead with this until we
have learned dandors language know
where he is and what he wants
philip crain hesitated he recog-
nized the force of the geologists argu-


startling stories

ment yet he was torn by that plead-
ing shrill old voice and the urge
from the depths of his mind to obey

   well wait then a little while he
finally said reluctantly until we un-
derstand

  zor krayn - zor called the
shrill tense voice from the cone

  crains eyes clung to that third
switch what would happen if he
closed it

  lets leave this until tomorrow
john martin was saying earnestly
we all need sleep rest tomorrow
well start trying to fathom this mys-
tery

  crain stepped off the crystal disk
and followed the others to the tents
but he kept looking back torn by the
strong impulse to return

  they talked little before they re-
tired all were too stunned by the
tremendous possibilities opened up
and there was constraint in the way
they looked at crain as though he had
suddenly become alien his own
thoughts were whirling incredible
vistas had opened before him and
the shadowy memories in his brain
were clamoring

  lying on his cot a little later
philip crain heard the heavy breath-
ing of fulton and the geologist as
they slept but he lay looking up
through the open tent-flap at the
starry heavens at the red spark of
mars that now was rising

  that red speck twinkled like a fiery
eye hypnotic luring yes calling to
him

  he could lie like this no longer in
his feverish condition of mind he
rose silently slipped on his boots and
moved through the starlight toward
the wreck

  in the thin starlight the squat ma-
chine bulked darkly the crystal disk
platform gleaming vaguely the red
eyes on the switchboard still glowing
he stepped up onto the disk and he
heard dandors voice still coming
from the cone

  krayn zor-zor-zor-

  the voice was exhausted worn and
laden with deepest emotion reduced
almost to a husky whisper swift sym-
pathy rushed through crain as he real-
ized that for all this time the aged

dandor must have been calling plead-
ing

  i cant do what you want crain
spoke miserably into the cone know-
ing he could not be understood they
wont let me

  in minutes the voice of dandor
came back louder tremulously beg-
ging

  zor krayn rop tharkol - zor
rop tharkol

tharkol why did that name
set every nerve in crains body
quivering he could not understand
he only knew that it made something
inside him wildly alive and eager de-
cision rushed upon him whatever
came of it whatever happened to him
he must do what dandor asked

  zor dandor he cried into the
cone with udden soaring exaltation
of spirit zor

  and his hand with a convulsive ef-
fort turned the third switch

  for an instant nothing changed
then as crain stood tense he per-
ceived that deep inside the thick crys-
tal disk on which he stood a pale blue
radiance was gathering a shimmer-
ing elfin light that grew slowly until
he seemed standing on an opalescent
platform of pearly blue fire and the
beehive transformers were humming
louder

  dandors voice came wild with
frantic joy and relief

  ni xel krayn xel

  four bell notes repeated over and
over and then the command again

  xel

  crain eagerly flung the fourth
switch shut the beehive apparatus
hummed still louder the opalescent
light inside the crystal seemed to
seethe and swirl like coiling snakes
of blue luminescence and philip
crain felt a strange weird shuddering
through his whole body as though
superhuman forces were streaming
through him

  a hi krayn-ahl cried dandors
voice quivering unutterably tense a
single bell note sounded ahl

  crain shaken by that streaming
force that flooded him reached toward
the first switch

  philip dont
the prisoner of mars

  kays scream she was running
toward the crystal disk now ablaze
with light she leaped up onto it
clutched his arm wildly her face was
frantic with fear brown eyes dilated
by terror of the supernatural

  kay get back he cried his face
strange wild ive got to do this
something out there calling me

  father scott she called franti-
cally

  crain heard john martin and ful-
ton answer in startled voices come
running they mustnt stop him now

  ahl dandors voice was calling
in desperation ahl

  crain thrust kay roughly off the
disk then he leaped to the switch-
board

  his hand flung the first switch shut
even as he closed it he heard a scream
and whirled to see that kay had leaped
back up onto the shimmering disk
and in the next heart-beat the thing
happened

  a terrific blaze of blue force ex-
ploded upward crain seemed to feel
every atom of his body inconceivably
wrenched and riven by that awful
force

  he felt himself hurled into dark-
ness he could not see or hear but
he had the weird sense of flying out
into space at a velocity inconceivable
rocketing out into the void as fast as
light itself

  in that terrific moment he was
aware of kay somewhere near him
flying out like himself into unimagin-
able abysses he sensed approach to
some vast body then he felt another
terrific wrenching shock and then
darkness

chapter iv
son of mars

crain opened his eyes his brain
was so stupefied by unearthly
shock that for a moment he did not
appreciate the full startling nature of
his situation

  he was lying upon a crystal disk
and kay lay unconscious beside him
this disk was dull dead not blazing

with light crain thought at first that
he and kay had only been stunned by
some strange force from the machine

  krayn cried a shrill astounded
voice and that voice came from be-
side him

  crain looked dazedly up an old
man with a withered face was bend-
ing over him his brow was high his
hair scant and white with years but
his eyes were wonderful - black
large expressive of immense intelli-
gence

  this oldster wore a short white
silken tunic over which a long gray
silk cloak was flung and he was
looking down into philip crains face
with an expression of stupefied amaze-
ment

  you-who are you crain mut-
tered hoarsely

  dandor cried the oldster eagerly
touching his breast su dandor

  dandor the man who had called
to him across the void crains heart
jumped wildly how had he come
to be here at dandors side where
was he

  he scrambled to his feet momen-
tarily unheeding the unconscious girl
his tall figure swayed his dark eyes
dilated as he gazed wildly around
him

  this place he choked where
am-

  he was in a big round room whose
walls were of time-worn blocks of pale
red stone it was lighted by a flaring
section of the ceiling like an artificial
sun the mechanism on which crain
stood and kay lay was at the center
of the room around the walls rose
machines of unfamiliar appearance
some seemed telescopic and spectro-
scopic apparatus another looked much
like a dynamo and still another was
oddly manlike with huge silvery
metal body arms and legs and a bul-
bous head with two glittering lenses
like eyes

  crains dazed gaze fixed on an open
window he stumbled toward it his
body felt unusually light weightless
cold wind hit his feverish brow as he
looked from the window-cold pun-
gent dry air laden with fine sand
particles his mind was reeling at
the strangeness of the scene outside




startling stories

  he looked out upon an alien world
a vast undulating plain of moonlit
sand stretching to dim horizons
strange little flickers of light like
ghostly will-o-the-wisps drifted
above the solemnly silent sands low
in the southern sky in a canopy of
brilliant stars hung two silvery
moons one high and small the other
a brilliant shield moving perceptibly
eastward

  it was a vista of alien enchantment
and lonely beauty upon which he
looked from the topmost chamber of
an ancient massive round stone tow-
er but most vonderful of all this
outlandish vista was vaguely familiar
to philip crain he knew suddenly
where he was even though the
knowledge was incredible

  mars he cried thickly my
god another world

he swung wildly around his
burning gaze probed dandor

  how did i get here he cried
hoarsely you-whoever you are-
speak

  he stopped his eyes had wandered
to the machine of the crystal disk on
which kay martin lay stirring

  in an appalling flash of perception
philip crain understood that ma-
chine and the one like it in the
canadian forest back on earth bridg-
ing the abyss between worlds-

  philip

  kay was sitting up her eyes brown
pools of terror he stumbled to her
side and took her into his arms

  philip whats happened to us
she cried

  he tried to make his voice calm to
fight down his own rising hysteria

  its unbelievable kay but that
machine we found and experimented
with back on earth has somehow pro-
jected us to this world to mars

  her face went white her cry was
frantic then weve got to get back
to earth

  yes crain said hoarsely he
swung toward dandor and gripped
the old mans thin shoulders frenzi-
edly

  youve got to send us back under-
stand back to earth-now

  there was a swift ponderous clank

of metal from a corner of the room
and kay screamed wildly the huge
manlike machine was moving a liv-
ing machine a great robot that was
lunging straight toward philip crain

  crain let go his hold upon dandor
with a cry of horror but the robots
metal hands were already grasping
crain lifting him from his feet to
dash him down on the floor

  raised aloft crain fought furi-
ously but his wild blows only bruised
his fists upon the impervious metal
head and body

  kto-leor cried dandor franti-
cally

  the robot kro stiffened holding
philip crain in mid-air dandor
shouted another sharp command and
kro in obedience put crain gently
down on the floor but the robot still
stood watchful unhuman lens eyes
watching every move crain made

  crain was dizzy trembling he
realized that the robot had thought
he was attacking dandor

  dandor spoke swiftly to the robot
crain heard the names lanu and
ingomar repeated several times

  ni rala said the robot finally in
a metallic voice that issued from the
orifice under its staring lenses

  and the monstrous metal creature
stalked past crain and kay opened
a door and clanked down stone steps

  crain heard a humming drone
somewhere in the base of the old stone
tower then through the open win-
dow he glimpsed something speeding
away across the moonlit desert a
thing like a giant silvery snake mov-
ing with incredible speed he real-
ized that it was a vehicle that kro the
robot had gone in it

  dandor his withered face taut with
excitement began to speak rapidly to
crain he pointed to objects and per-
formed little actions each time speak-
ing a word he was quite obviously
endeavoring to teach crain his own
language

to philip crains amazement he
learned almost as rapidly as
dandor taught him each word each
name that dandor uttered crain felt
engraved at once on his mind it was
as if he were learning a language he

once knew but had forgotten

  kay clung to him eyes in fasci-
nated fright on dandors face her
slender body was quivering

  hours must have passed one of
the two moons had already swiftly
set but now crain was speaking
with dandor haltingly stumblingly
yet with more and more facility

  the matter-caster on cholu -
there are others there by it who can
operate it at our instructions was
dandors first eager question

  you mean the machine back on
earth crain asked in bewilderment
yes there are others there

  good exclaimed the old scientist
triumph shone in his withered face
and glowing eyes now at last the
gulf between bara and cholu be-
tween this world and that is
bridged

  philip ask him to send us back to
our own world on that thing begged
kay

  but when dandor understood he
shook his head decisively

  your bodies would not stand an-
other shock of transmission so soon
he told crain who interpreted to her
you must wait but you can speak
to those others on cholu

  the old man touched the red button
on the switchboard of the matter-
caster a humming arose from it
dandor motioned for them to speak
into the cone above the switchboard

father cried kay frantically
father can you hear me its kay
minutes of silence then from the
voice-cone came john martins voice
choked with relief

  kay my god where are you
we thought you and philip were an-
nihilated by the blazing force of the
machine where are you

  on another world

  her voice broke philip crain
shouted explanation into the cone
martins voice was still more awed
when it came again

  this is incredible awful

  tell him dandor said quickly
that he must remain at the matter-
caster ready to turn it on when we
call him and that he must not tell
others on cholu of this

  crain hoarsely conveyed the old

scientists instructions

  its our only chance to get back
martin he added for you to be
there ready to turn the machine on
when we call you

  all right philip well wait here
martin grimly agreed but for
gods sake bring kay back safely

i will crain promised fervently
dandor shut off the voice-cone
then he laid a trembling hand on
philip crains shoulder his eyes
shining

  all is well and the gulf is
bridged he exclaimed and you
krayn have finally succeeded in com-
pleting tharkols great mission
tharkol the name rang again
through philip crains memory
who is tharkol

  tharkol was the great hero king
of our race dandor answered fer-
vently the king who thirty of
your years ago attemped to throw a
bridge across the abyss between
worlds by taking a matter-caster to
cholu in a rocket ship for ages we
of bara have dreamed of spanning the
gulf between this world and cholu
finally we devised the matter-casters
they make use of a secret long known
to us-a process by which living crea-
tures can be translated into clouds of
non-material photons into electrical
energy and can later be translated
back into solid matter unharmed

the old scientist saw the incre-
dulity in philip crains face and
stopped to explain he may have
thought crain not yet had full com-
mand of this baran language but al-
ready memory had opened it up to
philip crain as though he had spoken
it all his life

  it is simple enough dandor said
there are three fundamental kinds
of particles-the electron and the pro-
ton which are particles oi matter and
the photon which is the particle of
radiation the chief difference be-
tween them is that the electron and
proton possess an electric charge
while the photon possesses an electric
field electrons and protons can be
made into photons by changing their
electric charges to fields

  when that is done the solid mat-
the prisoner of mars



ter which the electrons and protons
composed becomes a photon cloud a
thing of pure immaterial energy a
human being can be changed thus into
a cloud of photons and the relation
between these photons will be the
same as that between that beings
electrons formerly and so that per-
son even as a photon swarm will re-
tain a shadowy kind of life and con-
sciousness and the photon swarm
can easily be changed back into a solid
human being

  the matter-casters were designed
to take advantage of this secret a
human being could step onto one be
converted by a blast of force into an
immaterial photon cloud and that
cloud could be projected along a tight
beam with the speed of light to an-
other matter-caster where it would
again be solidified

  we knew if we could get a matter-
caster to cholu we would have an
open road from bara to cholu we
would be able to flash from world to
world in moments through the matter-
casters but first we had to get one
of the machines to cholu and of
course it would have to be taken there
physically in some sort of rocket
ship

  finally after many trials we
scientists devised a ship that would
have a chance to reach cholu it
would be a suicidally risky attempt
and our great king tharkol chose to
lead that hazardous expedition whose
success would mean so much to bara
tharkol set forth thirty of your years
ago with a small crew on the heroic
attempt he carried a complete
matter-caster in his ship

  all bara waited tensely for word
that tharkol had reached cholu
safely in this desert laboratory i
dandor waited beside this other
matter-caster for tharkol to speak to
me through the voice-cones and re-
port success but no word came from
him and as the months passed all
bara believed he had perished and
all mourned our great king who had
died in the attempt to achieve this
thing for his race

  only i dandor never quite gave
up hope amid this general despair
but kept watch here through the years

hoping that some day tharkol would
call me and at last today my hope
was rewarded for you called krayn
-and you turned on the matter-
caster on cholu at my instructions
and at last our age-old dream of a road
to cholu is realized

dandors eyes flashed with al-
most superhuman happiness

  the road to cholu open at last
he repeated now comes baras
great hour of destiny now shall our
world bloom again and the pitiful
doomed ones be freed

  philip crain stared with wild sur-
mise in his eyes

  then that wrecked ship we found
on earth he said hoarsely is the
ship that tharkol piloted there thirty
years ago and wrecked in landing
and on that ship- he asked dan-
dor tautly have you any picture of
tharkol

  dandor nodded and took from a
cabinet a small curiously perfect
statuette

  this is a stereophot of tharkol
he said

  the statuette had obviously been
made by some process of three-dimen-
sional photography it was the figure
of a giant man dressed in baran
costume of tunic and cloak his great
head bare and that powerful leo-
nine face was unmistakable

  that philip crain choked blood
roaring in his ears is john crain
my father

  yes dandor agreed his eyes
glowing i knew it krayn the
moment i saw your face you are
the son of tharkol our great hero
king

        chapter v
        the doubles

philip crains mind rocked at
the revelation john crain his
father a great martian king

  no wonder that john crain had all
his life on erth been trying to re-
member a former life no wonder that
the giant man had stared night after


startling stories

 night into the starry skies dimly try-
 ing to remember that other world
 where he had been a great ruler

  your father tharkol dandor
was asking tensely he is dead he
must be since he never called me
he died but a few years ago crain
told the old scientist and he never
called you because he had no memory
of his life on this world

  he told dandor the story of his
fathers amnesia the mystery that had
clouded his life and he saw tears
mist the old scientists eyes

  tharkol our great king my friend
dying far away on cholu without
memory of his people and his world
whispered dandor living among
that alien people while we mourned
him here as dead and you his son
by a woman of cholu it is fates
work that you tharkols son should
at last have brought success to your
fathers heroic attempt

  you said you knew i was tharkols
son as soon as you saw my face
crain said but i dont look like him
except for my hair and eyes how
could you know

  you will understand that when
you meet lanu your half-brother
king of bara dandor replied

  my half-brother philip crain
cried

  dandor nodded yes when your
great father tharkol left bara on his
hazardous attempt he left here his in-
fant son lanu if tharkol did not
return lanu was to be king under my
regency until he attained his ma-
jority he is now the king of bara
i have sent kro my robot servant to
ingomar to bring lanu here i dared
not call by ordinary voice-cone for
the message might have been heard by
surp

  surp crain repeated his bewil-
derment growing who is he
dandors face clouded surp is a
powerful noble who has been intrigu-
ing against king lanu and has turned
the people against him if surp knew
the king was here in this lonely desert
tower he might seize the chance to put
him out of the way for surp aspires
to the throne himself-the traitor

  a martian king-my half-brother
philip crain gasped dazed and i-

half martian i cant believe it yet
all my life ive had vague memories
of some other place some other life

  aye you would have dandor
said for we barans possess a cer-
tain faculty of hereditary memory
passed down from father to son the
synaptic pattern of the fathers brain
tending to reproduce itself in the
sons brain had not your fathers
synaptic mental pattern been snapped
by shock you would have inherited
complete remembrance of this world
from him

  half-martian philip crain
breathed again

  kays face was white her brown
eyes appealing as she looked up at
him

  philip this wont make any dif-
ference to you-this finding out about
your martian blood she asked earn-
estly youll still want to go back to
earth with me

  yes of course he said slowly
im still dazed but i promised to
get you back safely

dandor had gone to the window

 was peering worriedly into the
night

  kro should have been back with
lanu by now he muttered if surp
has stopped them- then his eyes lit
here they come now see their
worm in the distance

  crain peered across the rolling
ocher desert dimmer now for before
long the nearer moon would set still
a plain of enchantment infinitely des-
olate alive with those strange flicker-
ing will-o-the-wisps that danced
drifting to and fro

  topping a ridge miles away a great
snakelike metal thing gleamed in the
moonlight the serpent-shaped ve-
hicle that dandor called a worm
with immense speed it was rocketing
across the sands toward the old stone
tower

  they heard it stop beneath then
heard steps coming up the stone stairs
the heavy clanking tread of the ro-
bot and the lighter step of a man

  philip crains tall body tautened
his half-brother king of this other
world was approaching

  lanu entered the room first he was
the prisoner of mars

a tall young man tall as philip crain
his dress was a brilliant crimson cloak
over a white tunic high strapped
sandals of soft leather were on his
feet and his blue-black hair was bare
at his belt hung a silver tube several
inches long

  dandor he cried as he entered
kro told me that the great plan has
finally succeeded his voice rang
exultant if it has it means new life
for our dying world and it means
the end of surp and his traitorous
schemes

  lanu was suddenly stricken silent
as he saw philip crain his dark eyes
bulged as he looked on the earthmans
face philip crain too was frozen
with the rigidity of utter stupefaction
as he looked at his royal half-brother
and from kay came an incredulous
cry

  philip its-you

  the face of lanu king of bara was
identical with the face of philip
crain

  it was more arrogant and petulant
in expression a little weaker in out-
line but otherwise the mirror of
crains face the two half-brothers
were doubles

  what devils magic is this cried
lanu his hand darting to the weapon
at his belt this man-hes me

 dandors withered face wore a
smile the old scientist looked at the
stupefied crain

  now you understand why i knew
you were tharkols son as soon as i
saw you he said

 my fathers son lanu cried
amazedly you mean that his fel-
low is my brother

  your half-brother dandor cor-
rected

  rapidly the old scientist explained

  and philip crain during that ex-
planation stood like a man amazed
this martian ruler his half-brother
and his double it added the final
touch of incredibility to all that crain
had experienced

kay was staring from one to the
other of the two men as though
unable to believe her eyes the one
in stained khaki earth clothes the
other in royal martian garb but



the robot grasped crain chapter iv


startling stories

facially physically exact replicas of
each other

  a half-breed brother from cholu
eh lanu muttered then he told
crain suspiciously you understand
that i am the eldest-that i rule bara
by right

  philip crain nodded spoke with
difficulty

  ive no ambitions to rule bara

  we shall find some place for you
at the court lanu continued patron-
izingly to crain even though you
are only half of baran blood and
youll be useful to us in helping oper-
ate the choluan end of the great
plan

  crain did not understand the refer-
ence but lanu was continuing ex-
ultantly his face lit with vengeful tri-
umph

  now i will crush surp and all his
schemes the people will turn from
surp back to me when they hear that
i have succeeded in achieving the
great plan at last that i am going
to bring water to bara from cholu

  water from cholu-from earth
philip crain cried incredulously do
you mean that that is your great plan
-to take water from earth for this
world

  aye that is the great plan krayn
dandor said the plan your father
risked hie life for he rushed on in
eager explanation this planet bara
has long been a dying drying world
for ages its hydrosphere has been
steadily deserting it for it is a law
of nature that small worlds with their
lesser gravitation cannot hold the
dancing molecules of their air and
water envelopes as well as can larger
worlds where the molecular velocity
of escape is higher

  once long ago we barans num-
bered hundreds of millions we had
built great cities upon the shores of
our seas had risen to a proud peak of
civilization but we could not master
nature we could not halt the drying
of our world slowly teadily re-
morselessly the seas shrank as our
water was dissipated into space

  the seas shrank to small lakes and
then those dwindled deserts appeared
where had been fertile lands and al-
ways the deserts spread the fertile

lands diminished bara could not sup-
port all the numbers of our people
every year many thousands of our
race had to be-disposed of so that
the rest of the race could live

  we moved to cities near the
shrinking snows of the north and
south polar caps our last water sup-
ply great underground aqueducts
were built to transmit that precious
water without loss by evaporation to
our cities but the snow-caps have
steadily failed too and now our pop-
ulation has been reduced to less than
a million people and our scores of cit-
ies to five cities only

  but if water could be brought in
great quantities from another world
it would revivify our dying planet it
would make bara green and fertile
able once more to support a great race
it would make possible the release of
the millions on millions of doomed
ones who pray through the years to
live again

  the doomed ones philip crain
could not understand but before he
could ask dandor was speaking on

       ong ago we barans saw in the
jla world cholu a source of the
water we needed we could perceive
that on cholu were vast seas rutha
the second planet from the sun we
knew to possess much water also but
it was so admixed with certain chemi-
cal elements that if brought to our
world would set up a reaction that
would produce a poison that would
vitiate our whole planet but cholu
possessed pure water and in more
than sufficient quantities to revive our
world

  that is the dream that we have
cherished for ages to hurl trillions
of tons of water from cholu across
the void to bara it can be done all
that is needed is to set up a great num-
ber of matter-casters along the oceans
of cholu and they will hurl ceaseless
streams of water in the form of de-
materialized photon swarms across
the gulf to this world

  that is why we have hoped to get
a matter-caster to cholu so that men
and materials could pour through-to
that other world and build many mat-
ter-casters and start the waters of
the prisoner of mars



that world streaming across space to
bara that is why your father thar-
kol risked his life to take a matter-
caster to cholu he knew that it meant
salvation for this world

  philip crains lean face was a stiff
mask of conflicting emotions as the
old scientist finished

  and you expect me to help you in
this plan he cried why it would
shrink earths seas to ponds would
condemn my own world to water star-
vation would bring disaster on earth
and my people

  your people exclaimed dandor
amazedly those choluans are not
your people krayn your people are
your fathers race the baran race
whose royal blood flows in your
veins

  but im still half earthling
philip crain exclaimed and to cause
such a disaster to earth- he stop-
ped his mind a seething chaos of be-
wilderment

  this plan that would rob earth of
water to revivify dying mars - he
couldnt let that be carried out the
green smiling earth made a desert a
disaster-stricken world-no

  yet even with that resolve firm in
his mind crain was strongly con-
scious of the martian blood in his
veins and his father had risked
death for this plan if he philip
crain was loyal to earth as he meant
to be he would be disloyal to his mar-
tian blood

  lanu was watching him narrowly
suspicion on his face

  i fear this half-brother of mine has
too much alien blood to be a true
baran he said

  he will be a loyal son of mars
dandor assured the young king he
is stunned by all he has learned now
and no wonder but be sure that no
son of tharkol will ever prove enemy
to his fathers people

  he turned to philip crain and kay
you need rest now he said solici-
tously later we will talk of these
things

  crain could see that the old scien-
tist was confident of winning him
over but lanu with the face so
weirdly identical with his own was
still suspicious

  dandor spoke a few brief words to
the robot kro the great automaton
answered metallically yes master

  kro will take you to a chamber
where you can rest dandor told
crain

crain had to support kay as they
followed the robot she seemed
unable to walk steadily against this
lesser gravitation and her eyes
showed her giddiness from its physi-
cal effects puzzled she had not been
able to understand all the astounding
things that had been told to crain un-
til now quickly he explained to her in
answer to her swift nervous ques-
tions she took it valiantly though-
at first-as crain had known she
would

  crain himself found his muscles at-
tuning themselves with amazing
swiftness to the new conditions and
the cold pungent air no longer rasped
his lungs

  the clanking robot led them down
the dark stone stair through a lighted
hangar or garage in the base of the
tower where two of the great worms
or snakelike vehicles stood under
this was a subterranean level of dry
well lighted living rooms kro opened
the door of one and then clanked
away

  the room was a square stone cham-
ber lighted by one of the little artifi-
cial suns in the ceiling the metal
furniture was simple - a couch and
chairs silk-covered and a table

  kay sank down into a chair and
covered her face with her hands

  millions of miles from earth she
whispered shakenly well never get
back-never

  buck up kay begged philip
crain dandor will send us back
when weve rested

  she shook her head her brown eyes
strangely bright as she uncovered her
face

  no they wont send us back she
whispered they want to win you
over to that horrible plan of looting
earth of its water they think be-
cause your father was a martian
youll join them you wont will you
philip

  of course not he answered slow-


startling stories

ly i couldnt do a thing like that
im afraid of your forgetting
earth philip she said chokingly
youre so exactly like your half-
brother so much a martian in appear-
ance

  you neednt fear me being disloyal
to earth he told her then his eyes
narrowed if we could get back up to
the matter-caster in the tower room
and hurl ourselves back to earth we
could destroy the matter-caster on
earth and cut the martians off from it
forever

  can we kay asked hopefully
not now he answered i might
overcome dandor but that robot -
hed be too much for me maybe later
crains face was pale with emotion
he must avert disaster to earth-and
in doing so he would doom his
fathers world

  through the silent chamber drifted
little floating flickers of hazy light
such as he had seen dancing in
myriads outside

  what are they kay asked puz-
zled they seem able to pass right
through the stone walls

  theyre probably just some elec-
trical phenomenon peculiar to this
world- crain started to say when a
sudden loud burst of shouts from the
tower brought him and kay both to
their feet

  men were pouring up the tower
-fiercely yelling men there was the
clash of metal against metal from
overhead then choking death-screams
echoing hideously

  mb i   i i  	 

       chapter vi
       dandors plan

kays hand flew to her throat
with those ghastly death-
screams had come a chorus of furious
cries of rage

  fighting up there philip crain
exclaimed his tall form stiffening he
raced to the door of the chamber
you wait here kay

  but she reached his side before he
could open the door

  no philip im going with you i
wont be left alone in this terrible
place

  you cant go he cried please
kay-

  crain stopped listening there had
come a loud shout of triumph from
above and then the noise of men rac-
ing hastily down from the tower
chamber crain flung open the door
and rushed down the little corridor
toward the stair with kay close be-
hind him

  outside in the silvery light of the
single moon now setting a half-dozen
men were climbing hastily into a big
snakelike worm that stood waiting
even as crain emerged the serpent-
shaped vehicle started with loud
drone and sped away across the moon-
lit desert through the dancing will-o-
the-wisps

  theyve gone crain cried
somethin gs happened those
screams-

  he raced up the stone stairs toward
the tower at the entrance to dan-
dors brightly lighted laboratory he
stopped appalled

  two men lay dead across the door-
way baran soldiers dressed in tunics
of woven scales and caplike silver hel-
mets their faces had been hideously
battered in

  another dead baran lay inside the
laboratory and beside that corpse
sprawled the enormous metal form of
kro a section of the robots torso
had been eaten away in some manner
exposing the intricate bulbs wires and
transformers of his vitals

  old dandor was just staggering to
his feet the scientists forehead
streamed blood from a bad wound and
his wrinkled face was ghastly he
gripped a long silver tube in his shak-
ing hand

  what happened cried philip
crain while kay stared over his
shoulder in horror

  lanu croaked the swaying old
man theyve taken him they dis-
abled kro with a gas-gun after hed
killed three of them and they struck
me down and left me for dead

  the king - kidnaped philip
crain exclaimed who did it
the prisoner of mars



  surps men choked the old scien-
tist they were masked but i recog-
nized the voice of ligor that hell-
spawned son of surp it was he who
struck me down

  surp repeated crain the noble
you told me about who wants to sup-
plant lanu on the throne

  yes answered dandor he was
tottering a terrible fear in his eyes
surps spies must have seen lanu
come here with kro and reported to
their master he sent ligor and the
others to kidnap the king and now
surp will strike to seize the throne
utter agony of spirit was in dan-
dors face crain sprang toward him
with quick sympathy

  get me the vial of orange liquid in
that cabinet said dandor thickly
motioning with his weapon

crain hurriedly obeyed he saw
dandor wince with pain as he
poured the orange fluid into the gash
on his temple but with incredible
speed the wound dried and closed in
a few minutes it was a brown scar

  our most powerful therapeutic
muttered the scientist it has the
power to clot blood and dehydrate
surface tissue almost immediately
now stand aside while i rid ourselves
of these dead with the gas-gun
crain drew kay back as the old
man pointed the silver tube in his
hand three tiny clouds of green va-

por puffed from the tube striking the
three bodies they instantly disinte-
grated crumbled vanished-and part
of the floor with them

 good lord crain exclaimed
astounded by the deadly power of the
weapon what kind of gas is that

  it is a secret synthetic gas that acts
as an instant solvent of almost all sub-
stances dandor said only the
specially synthesized metal of these
tubes can resist its dissolving action
we store it in the tube under tremen-
dous pressure and it forms our most
powerful weapon

  dandors strength seemed to be re-
turning now he bent over the mo-
tionless metal body of the faithful
robot

 only a few of kros electrical
nerve-fibers are damaged he mut-
tered their gas-guns did not hit
him squarely

  swiftly he began working with deft
fingers on the complexities of the ro-
bots interior mechanism then with
 tiny flame-jet from a small machine
he welded a new plate over it

  kro stirred his huge metal limbs
and rose to his feet with a ponderous
clanking the robot seemed un-
harmed by his experience

 are you hurt master he asked
metallically his expressionless lens-
eyes fixed on the old man

 not now kro dandor answered

startling stories

but agony was in his voice as he
turned to crain and kay i wish that
ligor had killed me better far to
be dead than live to see that upstart
surp ascend the throne of bara
what will surp do with lanu
crain asked tensely kill him

  he was feeling a surge of strange
emotion lanu arrogant and spoiled
as he had seemed was after all his
half-brother

  no surp is too crafty to kill lanu
at once dandor answered miserably
tomorrow morning in ingomar
capital of bara is a great annual cere-
mony-the drawing of the lots the
king must preside at that ceremony
when lanu does not appear surp will
undoubtedly declare the king missing
and proclaim himself regent

  once regent he will quickly con-
solidate his power when he feels he
has the reins safely in his hands then
he will have lanu killed until then
he will keep lanu a prisoner in some
secret place so that should anything
go wrong with his plans he can use
lanu as a hostage to save his skin

  he paused a moment with drooped
head then added achingly and the
danger of surp succeeding is greater
because lanu knows that the gulf be-
tween bara and cholu is now bridged
if surp learns that he will tell the
people that he has succeeded in bring-
ing the great plan to fruition he
will lead the baran forces to cholu
and then he will be firm on the throne
for the people will worship anyone
who finally brings new water to
bara

philip crain was appalled
this ruthless noble surp carry-
ing out that ominous plan speeding
across the void with martian forces
to loot earth of water using all the
weapons of martian science the
worms and gas-guns and probably
many more against earth when it
resisted the thievery of its water

  for a wild moment crain thought
of forcing dandor to send him and
kay back to earth so that they could
destroy the matter-caster there but
he realized that was impossible dan-
dor still had the deadly gas-gun in

his hand and the robot kro was stand-
ing ready to act force could achieve
nothing

  cant you go to ingomar and ex-
pose surp as the kidnaper of the
king he demanded of dandor

  the old scientist shook his white
head it would be useless surp
would simply deny it and what proof
would i have the men in the raid-
ing party were all masked his voice
quivered no it means the end of
lanus rule if he does not appear to-
morrow at the drawing of lots the
end of the long line of the rightful
rulers of bara

  dandors voice trailed off as his
great black eyes widened he stared
at philip crain as though he saw him
for the first time

  krayn he shouted exultantly
why did i not think of it before a
way to save the throne for lanu he
cannot appear for the drawing of the
lots tomorrow-but the king can-
you can you can impersonate him
you are almost an exact double of
your half-brother you can hold the
throne for him until we are able to
find and rescue him

chapter vii

under martian moons

philip crain reeled from the
staggering shock of the incred-
ibly audacious thing dandor was sug-
gesting

  to double for lanu-for the king
of this world he cried aghast no
i couldnt do it

  you can dandor insisted fiercely
and no one on bara except us
knows that lanu has such an identical
halt-brother no one will dream of
questioning your identity

  but i a man from another world
to dare such an impersonation
crain cried speaking in a language
which i have only just learned its
impossible

  you speak the aran language now
as well as lanu dandor declared
for you did not learn our tongue to-
the prisoner of mars

night you remembered it complete
knowledge of it was in the hereditary
synaptic pattern of your brain and i
recalled that

  still im utterly ignorant of your
world and customs crain declared
id betray myself in a moment
ill be at your side to coach you
dandor assured him eagerly

  yet surp and his son ligor-they
hold the real lanu prisoner some-
where crain reminded they
would know that i was an impostor
theyll know yes-but they wont
dare tell dandor retorted they
would not admit they had kidnaped
the king

  dont do what he asks philip
pleaded kay clinging to his arm
whatever it is dont let them
make a martian of you

  philip crains brain was spinning as
he considered a new idea that had
rushed into his mind this great
imposture that dandor proposed-it
might give him a chance to avert the
thing the martians planned to do to
earth

  crain knew that as a lone stranger
with a whole world pitted against
him he could not hope to thwart the
great martian plan but posing as
the martian king holding the reins of
power he might be able to thwart the
martian dream and he must do that
for strong as was the pull of his
martian blood he could no-t let disas-
ter come to earth

  swiftly he decided to take this one
chance open to him

  ill do it he exclaimed

  i knew tharkols son would not
fail me dandor cried joyfully

  kays eyes were wide with stunned
disbelief as crain hastily explained to
her translating what dandor had said

  youre becoming one of them-be-
coming a traitor to earth she angrily
accused crain

  its for earths sake im doing it
kay he told her swiftly in english
its the only way open to me to de-
fend our world

  will it help earth for you to join
her attackers she flamed youre
betraying your world for a throne
youre not the philip crain i knew

youre one of these martians-

  she swayed almost fell her face
colorless crain sprang anxiously to
support her

  she is feeling the effect of the
lesser gravitation and thinner air of
bara dandor said quickly you
who are half of baran blood have not
been affected so much

  he made kay swallow a few drops
of milky fluid and led her to a chair
she sat her face in her hands

  now we must start for ingomar
dandor exclaimed the night is
wearing away and the drawing of
the lots takes place soon after sun-
rise but first your garments must be
changed

he took from a cabinet a suit of
the silken martian garments in
a small closet philip crain divested
himself of his khaki clothes and boots
and put on the strange dress there
were white silk sleeveless shirt and
shorts a short white tunic belted over
them high soft leather sandals and
lanus brilliant crimson cloak

  lucky that the kidnapers left
lanus cloak here dandor muttered
the king must wear the royal crim-
son

  the old man gasped when crain
finally straightened for inspection

  youre the image of lanu

  crain glimpsed himself in a wall
mirror he stiffened was this be-
this tall resplendent figure crimson
cloak flaring behind him dark lean
face proudly lifted

  tharkols blood dandor was say-
ing his eyes glistening it shows in
you krayan you look every inch a
king

  sudden excitement throbbed like
strong wine through philip crains
blood he the lonely young engineer
-a king on mars and suddenly he
felt a heady tide of confidence and
authority after all he was tharkols
son

  his vaulting emotions chilled he
was letting his martian blood get the
upper hand and that must not hap-
pen he must keep remembering
earth and what threatened earth
that was his one reason for playing
startling stories

this dangerous game of impersona-
tion start the worm kro dandor
ordered we must hasten

  the great robot clanked down the
stairs crain put a martian cloak
around kays shivering shoulders and
pulled the girl gently to her feet

  kay made no resistance but her
brown eyes were bitter as they met
his he knew she was hating him for
his apparent desertion to the mar-
tains

  the three emerged from the stone
tower into the sharp chill of the open
air both moons which dandor had
called kabu and noru were now set-
ting one westward the other east-
ward

  the waiting worm was a flexible
annulated cylinder of silver metal
eight feet in diameter twenty feet
long its ring-shaped sections were
fastened by sliding joints so that they
could contract or expand longitudi-
nally

  it advances over the ground just as
a real worm crawls dandor ex-
plained by expanding the fore part
of its body straight ahead then con-
tracting it pulling the rest of the
body after it this motion repeated
with great swiftness gives the worm
great speed only such a vehicle as
this is practical on bara where the
deep desert sands would choke wheels
and where the atmosphere is too thin
for practical flying

  where does its power come from
crain asked staring at the thing

  from the sun dandor answered
surprisingly we barans have for
sole source of power the photo-electric
effect of the suns rays our mechan-
isms are all so constructed that when
the sunlight strikes them it builds up
photo-electric energy in them which
is automatically stored as a potential
in the machine itself the matter-
casters operate from the same power

  they entered by a small door in the
side of the worm metal chairs
swung in gimbals inside kro al-
ready sat in the control-chair by the
window in the nose of the vehicle a
hidden motor in the rear was droning

  to ingomar the scientist ordered
kro

  yes master answered the robot
flatly

kro jerked back a lever and the
strange vehicle began to slide
smoothly over the desert there was
no bumping for the flexible body
adapted itself to the ground soon
the worm was gliding at high speed
across the moonlit plain of sand

  over this vast plain dancing drift-
ing floating like little ghosts of light
hung the numberless will-o-the-wisps
that crain had noticed before like
a scattered host of glowing fire-flies
they wandered

  what are those shining things
he asked dandor some kind of elec-
trical phenomenon

  at the question there came into
dandors face a dim horror

  they are-the electrae he an-
swered an overwhelming sadness and
dread in his haunted eyes as he gazed
at the drifting things of light

  the electrae repeated crain un-
able to comprehend the dark horror
he saw in dandors face

  before dandor could answer the
robot kro turned and addressed him

  the sun is about to rise master
and we will reach ingomar soon
where in the city do we go
straight to the royal palace kro
ordered the old man to the rear
court

  philip crain stared at the huge
metal figure that sat so stiffly driving
the speeding worm and peering with
glassy emotionless lens-eyes out
through the window

  is kro really only a machine he
asked dandor incredulously he
seems so intelligent so human-

  he is but a robot whom i myself
constructed years ago dandor as-
sured him he has been the most
faithful of servants to me because
of my great services to the royal
family kro was permitted to exist
when all the other robots on bara were
destroyed some years ago

  why were they all destroyed
crain asked wonderingly

  dandor explained the people had
a bad experience that caused them to
be apprehensive of robots a com-
the prisoner of mars

s

thousands of men and worms were shot from the great matter-caster in the plaza

chapter xviii

mittee of scientists of which i was
chief had constructed a special
thinking-robot a great metal brain
with more than human aptitude in
mechanical matters we hoped that
this brain would be able to help us
design a rocket ship that would reach
cholu safely because for vital rea-
sons we had specialized in atomic
physics for so many generations that
we had neglected mechanical science

  the brain did in fact help us
greatly in the design of the rocket
ship in which your father tharkol
flew to cholu but shortly after this
the brain showed signs of feeling that
it was superior to men and its cunning
and its aptitude in invention were so
great that we decided that it and all

other robots should be destroyed
they were all taken into a remote part
of the desert and destroyed with gas-
guns

  philip crain glanced at the white-
faced girl in the chair behind him

wit ay you feel better now he
  jkm asked anxiously

  what difference does it make to
you she retorted bitterly you
and i-were not of the same races
any more since you chose to become
a martian

  kay please- crain began but
seeing that he could not now convince
her he gave up and stared moodily
ahead

  the sun was rising it seemed
startling stories

small and shrunken to crains eyes
yet blazed brightly in the cloudless
sky under its flaring light the sandy
wastes btretched in brooding somber
crimson marching to the horizon in
great ridges and dimes it was an
arid deathly landscape

  upon this limitless red desert the
hosts of drifting will-o-tfie-wisps
that dandor had called the electrae
and that he had regarded with such
mysterious dread were visible only
as vague flickers in the sunlight

  crain glimpsed green lands ahead-
a narrow fertile region that he knew
must overlay one f the hidden aque-
ducts that brought water from the
polar snow-cap when they reached
the fertile land kro drove the worm
onto a smooth road of pale red stone
that led through the cultivated strip

  on either side of them were inten-
sively cultivated fields of waving
green grain and low bushes of pale
yellow fruits no workers were visi-
ble nor was any animal life except
such few insects as would be needed
for pollenizing long ago crain
guessed the struggle for existence on
dying mars must have forced the
elimination of such comparatively
wasteful food-raising devices as do-
mestic animals

  this is the fertile strip in which
lies the capital ingomar dandor was
saying pitifully small it is no
wonder that each year we must have
the drawing of the lots

  kro pointed his great metal arm
ahead

  ingomar rasped the robot

  ingomar philip crairts heart beat
faster as he peered ahead the city
where he must carry out his great im-
posture for earths sake the city
where his father had reigned as king
and where today he must impersonate
a king

  aye ingomar our capital and one
of our five last cities dandor was
saying somberly all the others are
now but ruins in the desert tenanted
only by the electrae

  dim and rosy upon the horizon
reared a duster of incredibly slender
and lofty towers it looked like an
elfin city out of legend to the earthly

eyes of philip crain and kay and
as they drew closer the splendor of
ingomar seemed to grow greater
built all of pale red stones it was a
rosy city of the dawn

ingomar covered several dozens
of square miles many buildings
were no more than three or four stor-
ies high but everywhere from these
lower buildings aspired the slender
towers some of them two or three
hundred feet high and the towers
were ringed with giddy spiral stair-
ways and wide unsupported balcon-
ies that gave the whole rose-colored
metropolis its elfin fairy appearance

  crain realized that this fairylike
architecture was possible on mars be-
cause of the planets lesser gravita-
tion yet it still seemed to him that
those high balconies and unsupported
spiral stairs must crash at any mo-
ment that the whole city must fall of
its own weight

  far within the forest of fairy towers
rose two huge spires topping all
others pale red columns tipped with
flashing silver kro was driving the
worm straight through the wide
smooth-paved streets toward them
and they saw no human being in all
the streets and shops and stalls

  the place looks utterly deserted
said crain in astonishment

  the people are already gathered
outside the palace for the drawing of
the lots dandor cried hurry kro
-hurry

chapter vin
the droning of i he lets

hile the worm shot with ac-
celerated speed through the
deserted streets philip crains heart
pounded each moment this imper-
sonation that he had undertaken
seemed more fantastic and impossible
of success and dandor too seemed
wrought to a high pitch of tenseness

  many of the stone buildings of this
city of elfin rosy towers had an un-
occupied abandoned look whole sec-
the prisoner of mars

 

tions of the city were apparently un-
inhabited beginning to crumble mute
evidence of the dwindling of the mar-
tian race and their dying world

  what is this drawing of the lots
at which i must preside crain
asked dandor suddenly remembering
that in all the other excitement he had
not thought to ask

  no time to explain it now - we
near the palace the old scientist an-
swered tautly now comes the test
of our scheme he added urgently
i will be at your side telling you
what to say and do every moment
but be sure that your mien is proud
and haughty

  the twin lofty towers of the palace
lay now to their right as they circled
to approach it from the rear the
palace itself was an enormous oblong
structure of rosy stone a half-dozen
stories high the two soaring towers
rising from its east and west wings
flanking these wing lay green gar-
dens with small trees and shrubs of
blooming flowers

  the broad facade of the palace faced
upon an immense oval plaza in which
milled a vast throng of people at the
south end of this oval plaza facing
the great palace rose another massive
structure a domed round building
with walls of immense thickness

 the worm with kro expertly
handling its controls approached the
rear of the palace and passed through
opened gates of silver metal into a
paved court baran soldiers stood on
guard here dressed in tunics of silver
scales and gleaming helmets and
wearing gas-guns they sprang to at-
tention as crain emerged from the
worm

  dandor and kay followed crain
in the white silk cloak that dandor
had put on her shoulders the girl
looked as much baran as her compan-
ions the great robot clanked after
them

  through the left door and down
the corridor inside muttered dan-
dor to crain disregard the sen-
tries

  philip crain strode forward scarlet
cloak swirling brilliantly behind his
tall figure his lean dark face gazing

impatiently ahead as though not see-
ing the sentries

  the guards saluted with their gas-
guns and an officer bowing to crain
spoke respectfully

  the ceremony is ready to begin
highness

  philip crain nodded and strode on
through the door dandor had in-
dicated he found himself in a wide
rosy corridor aglow with the light of
tiny artificial suns in its ceiling down
this he went dandor hurrying kay
after him the huge clanking robot
following imperturbably

  the next door to the right-the
lift-cage of the west tower dandor
said in a low voice

   the lift-cage was a small cylindrical
metal chamber inside it dandor
touched a stud the cage shot up-
ward with a swift smooth and sound-
less rush it came to rest locking
automatically at a level high in the
tower this whole floor of the tower
was a single ring-shaped apartment

ou have passed muster so
far declared dandor ex-
ultantly now if you can deceive the
nobles and the people all will be well
for the time being

  philip crain wiped damp perspira-
tion from his brow i thought theyd
challenge me any moment he ex-
claimed

   this is my private suite in the pal-
ace dandor explained we will
leave the girl here under kros
watch

  so i am your prisoner now
philip the white-faced kay said
bitterly

  please kay try to reserve judg-
ment on what im doing he pleaded
i tell you im only thinking of earth
in all this-working for our world

  kay turned away unbelieving
though crain had spoken to her in
english he saw that dandor was
watching him so he desisted

  the rooms of the scientists ring-
shaped apartment were large lighted
by tall windows with silver gratings
the rooms were obviously the old
mans laboratory here the others
were hung in bright silks and the


startling stories

metal furniture was gracefully beauti-
ful

  the windows on one side looked
down upon the great plaza looking
down at the crowd that packed it
crain felt himself shrinking from this
adventure all those tens of thou-
sands waiting for their king  and he
was to deceive them

  now for the ceremony dandor
cried i crave to see surps face
when you make your appearance

  we cant fool them all crain
muttered his face tense

  you cannot back out now dandor
told him strongly come-we must
not delay longer

  they stepped back into the lift-
cage and shot downward as they
emerged into the corridor upon the
ground level silken-clad chamberlains
hurried forward dandor waved them
aside and without seeming to do so
led crain forward through the palace

  crain got but glimpses of great ma-
jestic halls hung with the royal crim-
son antechambers and broad corridors
leading in all directions balconies
opening upon the green gardens and
even here there floated the firefly im-
material things that dandor had called
the electrae drifting and dancing
through passages and rooms

  then crain found himself with
dandor in a small antechamber a
door in front of them was pierced with
a tiny window through which came a
shaft of bright sunlight

  wait dandor commanded it is
not yet the moment for the king to ap-
pear the nobles are still gathering

  philip crain peered through the
tiny aperture just outside the door
lay a broad stone terrace flanked by
solid ranks of soldiery their helmets
gleaming on the terrace were gath-
ering the nobles of bara-brilliantly
cloaked men and women in silks of
every color except crimson the
women wearing long gowns instead
of tunics under their cloaks

  one great object on the terrace
challenged philip crains attention it
was a metal pedestal upon which
rested two huge transparent spheres
whose curving edges touched one
sphere was a quarter filled with a mass

of tiny black balls and the other
sphere was empty

beyond the terrace stood the
great throng of people men
women and children-mostly dressed
in cloaks and tunics and gowns of
plain white or gray each man wore s
small black badge upon his breast and
this great mass of humanity unlike
the nobles stood in an utter dead si-
lence the two transparent spheres
on the terrace were holding their at-
tention

  see-surp and ligor come whis-
pered dandor indicating two green-
cloaked nobles who were coming up
onto the terrace with a numerous
retinue

  surp the ambitious intriguing
noble who aspired to the throne

  surp was a massive figure with a
face that combined brutality and the
shrewdness of experience a hard griz-
zled mask stamped with relentless
force ligor his slender indolent-
looking son was a handsome droop-
ing-eyed and foppish-looking young
man

  that devils cub ligor will be sur-
prised too to see me whom he thinks
he slew dandor exulted be not de-
ceived by his foppish appearance
krayn-he is a deadly antagonist

  they look damned confident
crain muttered and listen to the
people

  as surp appeared on the terrace a
low chorus of voices hailed him from
the plaza it was unmistakably a
chorus of approval

  surps massive brutal face and
shrewd eyes glistened with satisfac-
tion and ligors insolent eyes were
complacent

  i cannot guess by what means surp
has won the people over so far dan-
dor muttered every year it seems
the supporters of surp grow more nu-
merous and the supporters of lanu
fewer

  a chamberlain out on the terrace
raised his voice

  the princess mara

  the girl who was coming out of the
palace followed by two women wore
the crimson of the royal house - a
the prisoner of mars



flaming scarlet cloak over a silken
white gown that reached to her ankles
she wore white leather sandals and
her dark head was bare

  crain thought he had never seen so
proud so vital a figure her beautiful
clear olive face was composed but he
detected shadows in her blue-black
eyes she took her position and faced
the crowd in silence the dandified
ligor leaned and spoke to her eagerly

  princess mara is lanus financee-
your fiancee for the time being dan-
dor was saying tensely you are sup-
posed to be madly in love with her
remember that

  good lord exclaimed crain
aghast you didnt tell me that-

  blast of silver trumpets shattered
his words and after them the loud
voice of a chamberlain

  the king

  the eyes of all the vast crowd and
of all the brilliant nobles on the ter-
race turned toward the door behind
which philip crain and dandor stood

  remember speak as i whisper to
you dandor said

  crain caught the old scientists arm
kept him from opening the door his
courage was suddenly gone

  i cant do it he said hoarsely
not before that whole crowd and
court theyll know im not lanu

  you must do it exclaimed dan-
dor frantically think of what de-
pends on it-your brothers throne
see even now surp advances to de-
clare himself regent

there had been a low whisper
among the nobles and the crowd as
the king failed to appear the mas-
sive figure of surp was advancing to
the center of the terrace a triumphant
gleam in the nobles eyes

  that triumph in surps hard face
fired philip crains blood and
steadied his quivering nerves he
couldnt tamely allow the upstart
noble to seize the throne of his father
and crain was suddenly remember-
ing too all that depended on him-
the martian threat to earth that he
must thwart

  since king lanu does not ap-
pear- surp started to announce

loudly to the puzzled crowd and
philip crain flung open the door he
strode out onto the terrace in the sun-
light his dark head haughtily high

  the king came a shout of greet-
ing from the crowd though it sounded
forced and hollow the nobles bowed

  all except surp and ligor they
stared as though they could not be-
lieve their eyes ligors jaw was drop-
ping ludicrously and surps massive
face was white

  lanu and dandor ejaculated
surp but you cant-

  philip crain felt a sudden rush of
confidence of hard authority as he
faced the conspiring noble in that
moment he was tharkols son

  you were about to speak to the
crowd surp he said ironically
what do you wish to say

  nothing highness stammered
surp his face grey with shock i
thought-

  then why not go back to your
place with the other said crain

  the hard sharp tone of his voice
the flash of his eyes seemed to amaze
surp even further the thunder-
struck noble moved dazedly back to
the side of his son

  philip crain glimpsed the princess
mara gazing at him with dark eyes
wide with astonishment her red lips
parted amazement at seeing lanu
take that tone with surp he knew

  but now crain stood gazing into
the great sea of white faces that filled
the plaza faces that were blurred
with strange dread

  dandor was whispering and crain
spoke forth loudly repeating the old
scientists words

  people of bara another year has
passed and in it as in all the years
of the past our world has become still
more arid its water and fertile land
scantier so we must do what we have
had to do every year for ages-we
must decrease our population this
time by four thousand families that
many must pass that the rest may be
able to live

  four thousand men shall be chosen
in this drawing of the lots today
and those chosen shall with thir
wives and families depart tomorrow
startling stories

the day of passing and now i the
king in all justice and impartiality
draw the lots

  crain loudly repeating dandors
whispered words felt an inward
amazement these words that he was
saying-did they mean that four thou-
sand families were going to be killed
that was impossible surely yet-
the button on the pedestal of the
spheres dandor was whispering
tensely press it

crain pressed the black button
inside the sphere of the tiny
black balls air hissed the ebony balls
suddenly whirled with mad speed

  the packed populace on the plaza
were watching the whirling balls with
faces in which life and death seemed
to struggle for supremacy

  then crain noticed that there was
a small aperture between the two
touching spheres through this aper-
ture some of the swirling little balls
were constantly being thrown by ran-
dom chance into the empty sphere as
they entered the empty sphere the
tiny balls glowed with sudden light

  and crain perceived that almost
every time this happened to a ball the
black badge of one of the men in the
throng before him glowed also with
light he began to understand at least
the method of this great lottery

  those tiny black balls-there was
one of them for each man on mars-
and each ball were somehow in elec-
tro-magnetic rapport with the badge
word by that man when a ball was
thrown at random into the empty left-
hand sphere forces there caused it to
glow with light and the corresponding
badge of some man immediately
glowed also showing that the man and
his family had been chosen in the
drawing of the lots

  chosen-for what

       chapter ix
       palace of peril

an utter and awful silence held the
vast throng as this weird lottery
proceeded the tiny black balls in the

righthand sphere continued to swirl
and seethe but philip crain bewil-
deredly watching this strange lottery
over which he was presiding noticed
that some of the balls thrown into the
sphere of the chosen caused no badge
in the crowd to glow crain guessed
that those chosen in such cases must
not be in this crowd but were citizens
of the other four cities

  crain heard a man in the crowd ut-
ter a hoarse raw cry of despair as his
badge glowed a woman sank into a
dead faint as the man beside her was
chosen and another screamed chok-
ingly as her husbands badge broke
into fateful light but except for these
few the chosen ones in the throng ac-
cepted their fate in deathly hopeless
silence

  the machinery in the pedestal of
the spheres ceased to hum four
thousand balls had been thrown into
the lefthand sphere the drawing of
the lots was over

  dandor was whispering again be-
hind crain and philip crain speak-
ing slowly to that deathly-faced
throng repeated the words

  tomorrow is the day of passing
as you know tomorrow at noon the
chosen among you will gather with
your families in the temple where
they will pass that the rest of our race
may live

  slowly in deathly silence the great
crowd began to stream away and it
seemed to crain that as the throng
dispersed their horror-laden eyes
were fixed on the drifting firefly
things that flickered in the air-the
electrae

  as the crowd dispersed the nobles
left their positions and began to chat
and laugh together

  will all those chosen be at the
temple crain asked dandor incred-
ulously wont they try to es-
cape

  they cannot escape dandor an-
swered no man can live in the
desert and in the cities their glowing
badges would betray them

 they could throw away the
badges crain objected but the old
scientist shook his head

  no every man on bara must wear
the prisoner of mars

his badge always the nobility and
the scientist class wear no badges be-
cause they are exempt from the draw-
ing of the lots

  but what will happen to those
chosen ones tomorrow crain asked
they surely wont be killed

  no said dandor sadly it is a
fate far worse than death that- he
broke off the princess approaches
he muttered be careful now
krayn

  the eyes of the princess mara as
she came toward crain were fixed on
his face inquiringly

  where did you go in such haste
last night lanu she asked you
promised to tell me today

  so lanu had been with the princess
when dandor had summoned him to
the desert tower crain realized with
a chill that he might easily betray
himself to this girl

  i cant tell you yet mara he said
trying to smile later on youll
learn

  maras beautiful face showed aston-
ishment it is the first time you ever
refused me anything lapu

  crain abruptly remembered what
dandor had said-that lanu was
deeply in love with his fiancee he
was racking his mind for a reply
when there came an interruption

inside the sphere of the tiny black balls air hissed chapter vlll


startling stories

surp and ligor were approaching
him and all the nobles on the
terrace became silent intently watch-
ing as the powerful noble and his son
crossed the stone platform

  surps grizzled face still wore an
expression of dazed surprise and his
shrewd small eyes were calculating
as he bowed to philip crain ligor
his handsome countenance warped
with hatred was glaring at crain as
he also bowed

  i beg leave to depart highness
surp said his voice unsteady i
have urgent business

  a cold flame of wrath rose inside
crain he spoke without considering
his words

  urgent plotting against my throne
you mean he told surp harshly

  a gasp of surprise went up from the
nobles and mara who had stepped
a little back looked on with unbe-
lieving eyes

  surp seemed doubly stunned by the
sudden savage indictment his mouth
opened he tried to speak

  if you doubt my loyalty high-
ness he choked i-

  i know what your loyalty is
worth crain cut him off contemptu-
ously go if you wish your plots
do not worry us

  surps face had gone dull red at the
cutting rebuke but when ligor hate
twisting his handsome features
stepped forward as though to speak
his father held him back the older
man muttered in ligors ear then
they bowed and moved brusquely
away

  what possessed you to talk to surp
like that dandor whispered to
crain lanu would never have done
that he was too afraid of surp

  i couldnt help it muttered crain
now surp and ligor will speed at
once to wherever their men are hold-
ing lanu prisoner dandor said his
eyes narrowing they will want to
know how lanu escaped and they
will discover you are an impostor
the old scientists eyes flashed wait
-i will be back quickly

  and before crain could protest
dandor was gone pushing excitedly
through the throng of nobles

  philip crain felt a tremor of appre-
hension as he was left to himself sur-
rounded by the nobles who were all
gazing at him in puzzled surprise
without dandor at his side could he
hold up this impersonation

  the princess maras beautiful face
wore an incredulous expression as she
came closer to him

  i never thought that you had the
courage to beard surp to his face
lanu she exclaimed

  are you sorry that i did crain
asked

  sorry there was a flash like
lightning in her deep-blue eyes you
know how many times ive tried to
make you stiffen your attitude to
surp how often ive pointed out to
you the conspiracies against you
which he has fostered

  crain laughed with sudden reckless-
ness yes i know you have he said
but surp and his plots are the least
of my worries

  yet surp has the support of a
great part of the people rara re-
minded him they grow tired of
this yearly drawing of the lots-
tired of the shadow of horrible doom
under which they live and surp
makes them smooth promises that if
he is king he will abolish all that

  i can turn the people to my side
all of them whenever i wish crain
told her proudly and confidently

he was suddenly amazed to real-
ize how much unconsciously
he was stepping into the part of the
martian king he almost felt as if he
were king of bara by right

  crain knew whence that feeling
came-from his father that heredi-
tary memory-pattern that he had in-
herited from tharkol or john crain
-though once it had been broken it
was now waking further to life under
the stimulus of his present position
he mustnt let it wake too much he
must remain philip crain working
secretly for the cause of earth

  mara seemed puzzled at the power
and authority in crains confident
words

  you are different today lanu
she said thoughtfully
the prisoner of mars



   a tiny chill ran down crains back
had he overdone his part then he
saw in maras deep eyes the slow
kindling of something that stirred his
blood left him breathless

   i think she said that i shall not
 regret next weeks ritual so much
 after all

  what ritual takes place next
week crain asked before he
thought the next moment he could
have bitten out his tongue for
amazement showed in maras face

   our marriage of course she said
 in astonishment you cannot have
 become so absent-minded lanu
 crain floundered for an answer i
 was only jesting mara he said try-
 ing to laugh how could i be absent-
 minded about that when i have been
 urging it so long

   the princess said nothing but she
seemed intensely perplexed doubt-
ful crain realized that he had come
very close to complete betrayal of
himself

  he thanked his stars when he saw
dandor returning the old scien-
tists face showed suppressed excite-
ment as he asked mara

  youll pardon me princess if i
take the king from your side we
have an important matter to discuss
mara inclined her dark head word-
lessly her puzzled eyes still on crains
face awkwardly philip crain re-
turned the bow and let dandor lead
him toward one of the palace doors

   the old scientist was quivering with
 emotion something important must
 have happened but crain could not
 forget that dawning doubt in maras
 eyes even now she was looking after
 him with a little frown of perplexity

   crain felt a sudden stab of appre-
hension did mara suspect his im-
posture did she

the electrae

dandors voice was vibrant as
the old man led philip crain
hurriedly along one of the rose-walled

corridors of the palace

  we shall soon know where surp is
holding lanu prisoner he declared
i knew that surp and ligor would
hurry straight from here to the place
where they are keeping the king
and youve arranged for a spy to
follow them crain said quickly

  no dandor replied surp and
his men will be on the lookout for
spies i did better than that i put
a tracer into surps worm

  a tracer crain repeated uncom-
prehendingly

  dandors white head bobbed yes
a tracer is a tiny ball like those used
in the drawing of the lots contain-
ing a miniature transmitter of electro-
magnetic vibrations by means of its
constantly emitted signals we can
learn the tracers exact whereabouts
from an apparatus in my apartment
here

  they had reached the lift-cage and
in a moment were shooting upward

  when they entered dandors sun-
lit apartment kay was standing at a
window looking down upon the crowd
still dispersing in the plaza the
robot kro stood in watchful silence
exactly where they had left him

  dandor hurried into his laboratory
but crain paused anxiously at the
girls side

   i didnt like to leave you kay he
said but i had to

  her face was set and composed but
her eyes were full of scorn 

  yes i saw you down there among
your nobles speaking to your people
she said bitterly you looked a true
martian i congratulate you on the
speed with which youve adapted
yourself

  kay please try to understand he
groaned its as i told you-the
only chance i have of working for
earth against this martian scheme is
to play this part i dont like to do it
but ive got to

  i dont believe you she said
slowly you like being a martian
philip youve forgotten your earth
blood you forget it more every hour
were on this world

  crain could not deny the partial
truth of that indictment he had


startling stories

been forced to fight every moment
against the strong pull of his martian
inheritance

  youre a king on mars now kay
was adding scornfully the philip
crain who would have died rather
than join the enemies of his own
earth people is dead

  krayn-come here dandor called
from his laboratory

  with a hopeless glance at kays set
embittered face philip crain turned
and entered the room where dandor
was hanging over a big globe that
represented the planet most of it
was blank red desert but at the poles
were the little white snow-caps and
branching from them the canals that
carried water to the scant fertile lands
around the few martian cities

 not far from ingomar upon the
globe-map shone a tiny spark of white
light it was moving slowly south-
eastward crawling into the blank red
desert

he signal light from the trac-
er dandor explained the
tracers emitted electromagnetic vi-
brations are received by the apparatus
inside this globe and automatically
plotted by direction and intensity so
that that little spark shows the trac-
ers exact position at any time
then surp and his men are holding
lanu somewhere in the deserts south-
east of here muttered philip crain

 dandor nodded we shall soon
know exactly where and then we
can make an attempt to rescue lanu
rescue lanu crain wondered as
he stared at the crawling little light
what he was to do then it might be
that if he saved lanus life and throne
lanu would be grateful enough to
abondon the plan of looting earth
of water but crain doubted it from
what he had seen of lanu he doubted
that he could count much on his
spoiled and arrogant half-brothers
gratitude and even if lanu were
willing to abandon the great plan no
one else on bara would be willing to
do so once dandor made the fateful
announcement that the way to earth
was open

  i thought he said to dandor

that you were going to announce at
the drawing of the lots that the way
to chola is open

  no krayn said the old man earn-
estly i plan for you to make that an-
nouncement tomorrow in the temple
coming from you the supposed lanu
just before the chosen ones pass to
their fate it will set the people wild
with joy and will make them all firm
supporters of lanu

  crain was dismayed he didnt want
to make that announcement that em-
bodied such a dire threat to earth

  why not wait until after we have
rescued lanu he suggested

  we cannot afford to wait dan-
dor said for should surp learn from
lanu that the great plan nears success
surp might announce it to swing sup-
port to himself

  crain dared not oppose the scien-
tist further without the risk of arous-
ing dandors suspicions he must
keep dandor convinced that he was
loyal to bara

  he would make the announcement
crain decided swiftly but every mo-
ment he would be scheming and work-
ing to thwart the great plan

  but dandor he asked this time
determined to get an answer whats
going to happen to those chosen four
thousand families in the temple to-
morrow you said they wouldnt be
killed

  into dandors face came that quail-
ing horror that shadow of icy dread
that had been there before at that
question

  no krayn they will not be killed
he said heavily but a dreadful fate
hangs like a sword over every person
on bara with the exception as i told
you of the nobles and scientists

  what fate crain insisted tightly

  dandors black eyes were somber as
he looked at the younger man krayn
do you remember asking me about the
little things of floating light that are
everywhere on bara-the electrae

crain nodded they had puzzled
him ever since his coming to
mars those weird little firefly enti-
ties

  what about the electrae
the prisoner of mars



  the four thousand chosen ones and
their families dandor answered
solemnly will tomorrow become
electrae

  what crain exclaimed shocked
to the depths of his soul you mean
that all those human beings will be
changed into those things of elec-
tricity or light

  only too terribly true krayn
dandor admitted sadly it has been
going on upon bara for long years
everyone of the countless electrae
you have seen everyone of those drift-
ing and immaterial electric things
was once a human being

  philip crain was appalled unable
to credit the vista of horror that dan-
dors words opened up

  it began dandor was saying
somberly when we realized that our
drying dying world could not support
all our numbers yet we could not put
some of our people to death to solve
the problem that would be murder
would plunge our world into riot and
war

  then one of our scientists ad-
vanced a solution they had concen-
trated upon atomic physics the inner
structure of matter hoping to find a
method of transmutation of elements
which would permit the synthesizing
of artificial food and water their
hope was shattered for they learned
that transmutation on a large scale
would release uncontrollable atomic
energy which would destroy our
world they had to give up that hope
but they had learned much about
atomic structure

  they had learned that the elec-
trons and protons of which matter is
composed can be transformed into
non-material photons or corpuscles of
radiation by converting the electric
charge of the electron or proton into
an electric field even a living crea-
ture could be transformed thus into
photons

  a living creature so changed into
a photon cloud retained a certain life
a certain consciousness since the pat-
tern of his photons remained relative-
ly the same as his former electronic
pattern though now a mere cloud of
photons those immaterial particles

retained the vital patterns of life and
mind as immaterial electric clouds
such changed beings could live eter-
nally needing no food or air or any-
thing else and could be translated
back into solid human beings at any
future time

  the scientists proposed that our
surplus population be changed into
such immortal and immaterial crea-
tures of electricity-the electrae as
electrae they would not be living as
we know life yet neither would they
be dead for they could always be
changed back into real people they
would merely drift about our planet
eternally and some day when the
great plan to revivify bara with new
water succeeded the electrae could
all be transformed back into human
beings

  since then thousands on tens of
thousands of barans have become
electrae there are now millions of
the blind dumb shadow things float-
ing aimlessly about our world living
out their deathless existence waiting
for the hoped-for day when they may
again become human beings

he existence of the electrae is
a hollow mockery their dim
consciousness is unable to see or hear
or feel anything since as photon
clouds they have no sense organs
they are sensitive to electrical ema-
nations of certain kinds and can com-
municate dimly with each other by
means of impinging waves from their
own photon beings but they can hold
no communication with any living be-
ing on bara they are mere ghosts
floating dancing drifting in a blind
darkness in which they can feel noth-
ing hear nothing see nothing

  and that krayn is why we people
of bara have for so long hoped and
dreamed of getting water from cholu
that is why your father tharkol
dared everything in the heroic at-
tempt to reach cholu those millions
of lonely bodiless electrae who drift
forever around our world-we all have
friends loved ones among them
whom we pray may some day be re-
leased from their horrible state

  good god crain whispered all


startling stories

those flickering things-once men and
women-

  aye the electrae are the tragedy
of this world dandor said solemnly
searing pity and sadness in his eyes
every baran dreads each year that
he may be chosen in the drawing of
the lots that he and his family may
be called upon to enter that dim state
of bodiless immortality

  crain shuddered deeply as he
looked out of the window and saw
even now amid the sunlit towers of
the rosy city vague flickers of light
drifting aimlessly to and fro

  immaterial electric things that had
been men cut off from all life all
reality floating through dim eons

  it was the process used in chang-
ing people into electrae dandor was
saying that we adapted to use in the
matter-casters the matter-casters
make use of a differently tunsd force
but they too translate matter into a
photon cloud that is projected to an-
other matter-caster which re-trans-
forms it into solid state just as
some day all the electrae may be re-
transformed

  and now he added his tragic
eyes lighting with new hope the day
of the release of the electrae cannot
be far off-now that you have helped
us open the way to cholu and its
watet when bara is revived and the
electrae become men and women
again they will bless your name
krayn

  philip crain shrank from the old
mans fervent praise he didnt de-
serve it-he who was working se-
cretly not to achieve the great plan
but tp thwart it

  crain felt himself caught in a tragic
and terrible dilemma he must be
loyal to earth the world of his birth
and breeding he couldnt let the
martians loot earth of its water and
make of earth a devastated planet

  yet if loyal to earth if he succeed-
ed in thwarting the martians then he
was dooming the electrae to remain
forever in their unthinkably horrible
state was sentencing men and wo-
men whose blood flowed in his own
veins to remain in that terrible im-
mortality forever i

       chapter xi
       princess of bara

bewilderly crain psced to
and fro distraught his mind in
turmoil he told himself fiercely that
he must not let sympathy for the
tragic electrae distract him from his
purpose he must fight for earth

  see the tracer has stopped dan-
dor exclaimed bending more closely
over the globe

  crain hurried back to his side
upon the glqbe the tiny spark of the
tracer was stationary in the blank red
desert far southeast of ingomar

  i know that place dandor said
there lies the ruined city llon
one of the many great cities when the
seas shrank ages ago

  then surp and his men are hold-
ing lanu prisoner in the ruined city
they must be dandor affirmed
no one ever goes there and surp
must have some secret place there
the old scientists eyes narrowed in
thought we shali have to go alone
to rescue lanu he said we dare
not take soldiers with us for no one
must know of this impersonation of
yours somehow we must get lanu
away replace him on his throne with-
out anyone knowing what has taken
place and it will be hazardous
philip crain said nothing he was
trying to decide his own course of
action in the face of this situation

  lanu was his half-brother-yet if
he himself was killed trying to rescue
lanu it meant all chance of averting
the martian onslaught on earth would
be gone

  still if he refused outright to at-
tempt a rescue of lanu dandor would
at once begin to suspect him

  dandor postponed crams decision
we must wait until after tomorrow
to attempt our rescue of lanu he
declared for tomorrow is the day
of passing when you must be in the
temple for the dreadful ceremony
only those of royal blood are allowed
to approach the altar which trans-
forms the chosen ones into electrae

the scalpel stabbed

flesh of craint body chapter xv

   tomorrow night we shall go to
ruined llon

  crain nodded hoping that before
the next night he would have found
some way to strike for the cause of
earth he had formed a vague plan
that he hoped he might be able to put
into effect if he could slip out of
this city with kay speed to dandors
desert tower where the matter-caster
was and flash back from it to earth
then they could destroy the matter-
caster on earth and end the threat

  he felt a pang at the thought that
he would be cutting himself off for-
ever from this world that he was com-
ing somehow to love this world of his
fathers kingship and that he would
be sealing the doom of the tragic

hordes of electrae for all time

 you must go now to the kings
apartments krayn dandor was say-
ing it might cause wonder if you
remained in my rooms ill go with
you to be at your side should you
need my coaching

  but kay crain asked anxiously

dandor looked thoughtful the
girl is still loyal to cholu is she
not i have guessed that from her
talk with you though i cannot under-
stand that choluan language

  yes she is loyal to cholu crain
said slowly she thinks that i too
should remain loyal to that world

 as though the son of tharkol
could own loyalty to any world but
startling stories

bara dandor exclaimed unsuspi-
ciously the girl must be kept under
watch krayn she might do or say
something that would betray you we
shall take her with us to your royal
apartments and kro can guard her
and he added she must wear the
baran cloak we want no suspicion
of her identity

  but kay refused to wear the cloak
i have not turned martian philip
she said her eyes hard and hostile
i wont wear their clothes

  tell the girl that i can have kro
wrap her in the cloak and carry her
dandor said emphatically

  the threat had its effect angrily
kay wrapped the silken cloak around
her

  the lift-cage took them down to the
ground floor of the palace chamber-
lains ushered philip crain toward the
apartment of the king guards out-
side its door raised their silver gas-
guns in salute to him as he entered
dandor kay and the clanking robot
followed him

  the royal apartment was a series of
magnificent rooms high-ceiled cham-
bers with walls of rosy stone hung
with brilliant crimson silks upon
which were worked golden portraits
all the furniture was of metal for in
this world wood was a rarity upon
the floor were thick soft dark green
rugs

  tall windows admitted the sunlight
it was sinking toward the horizon for
hours had passed while they watched
the tracer as shadows gathered lit-
tle flaring artificial suns automatically
glowed in the ceilings waxing in
brightness as the daylight waned

  they are simply areas of the stone
ceilings dandor answered crains
question about the lights in which
an electric excitation of the atoms of
the stone itself is induced causing
them to emanate light-waves

  he pointed to the golden portraits
that were worked into the crimson
hangings

those are portraits of all the long-
dead kings of bara he told crain
all of them your ancestors krayn
philip crain could not restrain his
eager interest as he moved along the

walls staring at those golden faces
his ancestors kings of bara whose
blood throbbed in his own veins

  he uttered an exclamation when he
came to the last portrait that great
leonine head that powerful face-
how well he knew them

  my father he exclaimed

  dandor nodded yes the great
king tharkol father of lanu and
yourself his portrait was added
when he was believed to have per-
ished the old scientist stared sad-
ly into memory how many times
have i sat in this very room with
tharkol working for the furtherance
of the great plan how i waited and
hoped for the word to come from him
that never came his eyes bright-
ened but you finally called and
came krayn-you tharkols son it
is almost like having tharkol himself
beside me again for you have your
fathers strength and purpose as lanu
has not i wish that you were really
the king krayn

the simple wistful words touched
philip crain brought a lump to
his throat impulsively he grasped
the old mans hand

  no matter what comes he said
im glad that ive known you dan-
dor my fathers friend-and mine
his conscience hurt him for it was
his duty to thwart dandors dearest
purpose to wreck the old scientists
lifelong work and hope

  a servant obsequiously entered the
softly-lit apartment and bowed low
to crain

  a message from the princess
mara highness he said she asks
you to dine with her tonight

  philip crain glanced inquiringly at
dandor who nodded imperceptibly

  tell the princess mara that ill
come crain said

  when the servant had gone crain
turned to the old man his lean face
worried and anxious

  i dont like to meet that girl
again he exclaimed dandor im
afraid that she half suspects me
she would suspect you even more
if you did not come dandor de-
clared lanu was madly in love with
the prisoner of mars



her and spent most of his time with
her more time than mara cared for
since she has never loved lanu

  then why is she marrying him
crain bluntly demanded

  dandor shrugged the king must
marry only the highest blood and it
was felt that this marriage would
strengthen lanu with the people
against the plots of surp

  youll go with me crain asked
anxiously

  the old man shook his head em-
phatically i dare not krayn it
would infallibly make mara suspect
something for lanu would never
have me accompany him you must
rely on your own wit to keep from be-
traying yourself keep to generali-
ties and get away as soon as you can

  kay watched philip crain with a
shadow of heartbreak in her bitter
eyes as he prepared to go though she
had understood nothing of the con-
versation that told where he was go-
ing yet when he spoke to her anx-
iously she stared stonily past him

   he felt oppressed by the girls atti-
tude as he started through the palace
behind two obsequious chamberlains
kay thought him a traitor to earth-
and dandor would think him a traitor
to bara when the old man learned his
real purpose and he would in some
sense be a traitor to bara to the elec-
trae if he succeed in doing what he
must do

  the rose-walled corridors of the
great palace beamed with light serv-
ants and guards sprang to stiff atten-
tion as philip crains tall crimson-
cloaked figure strode through the
halls

  men and women of the nobles
stepped to one side and bowed as he
passed he inclined his head toward
them without speaking

  his chamberlains flung open two
wide silver doors and made loud an-
nouncement into the rooms beyond

  the king

  crain stepped uncertainly forward
this was an apartment in the east
wing of the palace much like his own
except that the chambers were small-
er the hangings daintier the whole
place breathing a feminine atmosphere

mara was coming to meet him
the baran princess had dis-
carded the royal crimson and wore
both cloak and gown of white a sin-
gle brilliant green jewel blazing in
her tightly-coiled blue-black hair

  her deep eyes clung steadily to his
and there was an expression of queer
interest on her beautiful face as she
bowed slightly to him

  i am surprised that you came
lanu she said a little mockingly i
have heard that there is a strangely
lovely girl in your apartments to-
night

  how did you learn that philip
crain asked startled

  can anything remain secret long
in this gossip-ridden palace she
countered who is she

  a niece of dandors crain an-
swered with assumed indifference
then a devil in him made him ask
youre not jealous darling

  of course not mara answered
with cool detachment she nodded
toward a small metal table set beneath
soft lights shall we dine now

  crain was suddenly conscious of an
amazing hunger he realized that he
had eaten but little for many hours
and the martian food was good
there was no meat but a half dozen
different vegetables had been blended
by skilful cookery into delicious fla-
vors

  there were queer-tasting yellow
fruits also and a flagon of thick black
wine the wine warmed him and he
filled his glass again he felt the
superhuman strain under which he
was laboring drop a little from his
shoulders

  you seem more interested in the
food than in me mara said studying
him youve changed lanu

  a warning note rang in philip
crains brain but he looked at her
calmly over his wine-glass

  in what way he asked as they
rose

  in-many ways maras black
brows knitted in puzzlement

  crain sensed that this girls half-
formed suspicions were dangerous

  i havent changed in one way
mara he said and deliberately took


startling stories

her into his arms before she could
speak or move crain bent to her lips
hell hed prove to her that he was
lanu

   the lips of the baran princess were
soft and sweet her midnight hair
breathing fragrance into his nostrils
her willowy body suddenly yielding
a dizzying shock rocked crain and
he was trembling a little as he drew
his head back and mara was breath-
less

  lanu you never kissed me like
that before she exclaimed

  hed overdone it then crain
thought dizzily but he hadnt been
able to help himself mara was still
inside the circle of his arm her blue-
black eyes glowing with new light

  crain fought down the strong im-
pulse to repeat that kiss mara was
his half-brothers fiancee he must
play a part but he mustnt let himself
play it too well

  they moved out of the room onto a
broad balcony standing there in the
darkness his arm around maras slim
silken figure crain stared fascinat-
edly into the night-shrouded gardens
below

both of the two silver moons
were in the heavens the farther
one shining high and remote in the
east the nearer one visibly creeping
across the star-shot sky above the
southeastern horizon twin moons
whose shifting silver rays fell in un-
real beauty upon the soaring towers
of ingomar and upon the low shrub-
like trees and massed flowers of the
gardens

  the air thin and cold but laden
with pungent scents further waked in
crain the haunting hereditary memo-
ries in his mind for the moment he
felt himself wholly of this world and
people standing here with mara close
beside him looking out upon his
world his city

  mara shivered slightly and her
voice held brooding sadness

  always when we are most happy
we must remember the doomed ones
the electrae she whispered

   sadly she gazed at the flitting hosts
 of beautiful glowing things like fire-

flies drifting through the gardens
and through the elfin towers of the
city around them drifting dancing
floating on in their eternity of dim
and unhuman consciousness men
and women once and now those beau-
tiful terrible things of drifting light

  they poison our happiness al-
ways mara was saying somberly
she pressed closer against him with
a shudder i cannot keep from
thinking of those thousands of the
chosen who tonight know with sad
hearts that tomorrow in the temple
they must become electrae

  i know philip crain said heav-
ily i cant forget them either

  no he could not forget them for
he knew that on the morrow it would
be his own hand that would hurl those
chosen victims out of life into that
terrible immortality

       chapter xii
       the day of passing

through the brilliant noonday
sunshine of ingomar echoing in-
to every nook and cranny of the citys
rosy towers throbbed the slow and
heavy tolling of a great bell deep
low notes speaking out of a hoarse
iron throat to a city that dreaded its
summons

  from every quarter of ingomar
people were streaming toward the
low domed temple at the south end
of the great plaza philip crain
watching from the window of his
royal apartment could see the slow-
moving silent throngs converging up-
on the temple and they moved in a
dread and deathly silence

   it is time to go krayn said dan-
 dors low voice the passing of the
 chosen must begin

   do i have to do this thing philip
 crain asked distractedly change
 those people into the horrible elec-
 trae

  you must yes dandor said sadly
there is lack of food even now un-
less those chosen go into the electrae
today many will starve tomorrow
the prisoner of mars



the old mans eyes lighted a little
as he added yet they will not be
electrae for long you shall tell
them today of the imminent success
of the great plaiv and once we have
rescued lanu it will not be long be-
fore our expedition goes to cholu to
bring to us the water that will make
possible the release of all the pitiful
doomed

crains wide shoulders sagged
all right-im ready he said heav-

ily-  

kay stood at the window gazing at

the crowds entering the temple crain

went to her side

youll be safe here with kro he

said earnestly in english and kay

soon you and i may be able to get

back to earth and cut the connection

between worlds

she looked at him with no belief

in her white set face you tell me

that tell me youre working for earth

while you sit on the very throne of

this world she said

kay you must believe me crain

urged

her brown eyes flashed why do
you stay here with me when your
martian princess is waiting

crain had already told her who
mara was and that the princess was
affanced to the baran king

come krayn dandor called im-
patiently

hopelessly philip crain turned
and followed the old scientist the
robot kro a motionless statue of
metal still stood where he had
stopped the night before his lens-
eyes fixedly watching the girl by the
window

crain and dandor passed through
the rosy corridors of the palace to-
ward the south facade and dandor
was talking earnestly lowering his
voice so that they could not be heard
by the half-dozen servants respect-
fully following them

remember my instructions on
what you are to say and how you are
to operate the altar krayn the old
man said i cannot be beside you
when you do that for only those of
royal blood may stand upon that spot
if you forget you are lost

  i wont forget crain promised
remembering the minute instructions
dandor had given him that morning

  if you can continue your imper-
sonation unsuspected today dandor
added eagerly we will have a chance
to rescue lanu tonight and end this
perilous situation

they emerged onto the stone ter-
race that fronted the palace
princess mara and her ladies were
coming out of another entrance mara
again wore the royal crimson cloak
her face was pale with tragic antici-
pation and her eyes were shadowed
as she greeted philip crain

  trumpets of guards upon the ter-
race blared as crain and the princess
started with their small retinue to-
ward the temple the shrinking hor-
ror that all day had possessed crain
increased as they approached the mas-
sive arched entrance of the great
domed building

  courage lanu whispered mara
clasping his hand this is the hard
duty of the kings of bara

  the warm clasp of her fingers
strengthened him ill try to do-my
duty he muttered

  a heavy company of guards was
posted outside the temple entrance
they passed between the saluting sol-
diers then crain halted shaken
staring into the place

  the interior of the temple was a
single vast shadowy hall it was a
huge circular amphitheater with
many tiers of stone seats rising steep-
ly from a large round black-paved
stage

  at the center of this stage was the
altar it was simply a disk of white
crystal set in the black stone floor
near it rose a standard of red metal
that bore six little wheels which were
the controls of the altar

  grouped around the outer part of
the great stage stood some thousands
of men women and childen all were
dressed in white and the badge of
each man among them was glowing
they were deathly silent

  the chosen

  in the rising tiers the first rows
of seats were occupied by the bril-


startling stories

liant nobles the other tiers far up
into the lofty shadows were filled
with the people of ingomar leaning
tense and spellbound watching

  and most horrible of all to philip
crain through the shadowy interior
of the vast and silent temple scores
of firefly things of light drifted aim-
lessly scores of electrae floating
here as everywhere before the eyes of
the thousands who were soon to enter
that living death themselves

  crain felt his courage crumbling
like sand he felt a wild desire to
flee from the coming horror

  steady krayn whispered dan-
dor tautly

  i cant do this thing-i cant
crain muttered thickly his lean face
pale as death

  you must the old scientist whis-
pered frantically remember these
victims will not be electrae long-
soon the great plan will make possible
their release

  his words were no comfort to
crain for he knew that if he were
successful in his own intentions that
plan would never be achieved the
electrae never released

  see-surp and ligor approach
dandor whispered you must not
show weakness now

  the massive surp and his handsome
son were coming along the aisle to-
ward the royal party crain stiffened
surp must know now that he was an
impostor that the real lanu was still
their captive what would the no-
ble do

  secret satisfaction was written
plain on surps hard brutal face his
shrewd eyes had a glint of ironical
mirth in them as he bowed with exag-
erated respect to crain

 greetings highness he
said loudly you tarry long
here it is almost as though you had
never seen the temple before

  yes drawled ligor insolently
amusement in his drooping eyes as he
watched crain a man from another
world could not be more amazed than
you seem-highness

  they knewl they had learned
from lanu that he was from earth

and were taunting him with their
knowledge mara and the others
stared astounded by their effrontery

  crains lean face hardened as his
anger rose white-hot for a moment
he felt all martian all king these
two upstarts daring such words to
him

  you forget yourself surp he
said stingingly you and this inso-
lent cub of yours should be in your
seats like my other nobles must i
have guards escort you there

  surp went purple with rage you
dare talk so to me he cried you
a mere-

  he checked the raging words on his
lips checked them crain knew be-
cause accusation of crain as an im-
postor would be accusation of himself
as kidnaper of the king

  bursting with baffled rage surp
glared and ligor all his drawling
insolence dissolved in fury was show-
ing his teeth like a maddened panther

  to your sets crain commanded
roughly you are delaying the cere-
mony

  surp controlled himself with a
great effort

  very well highness he grated
making the title of respect sound like
a curse

  there was deadly menace and mal-
ice in the nobles hard face and in the
raging eyes of ligor as the two went
down to take their places with the
other nobles

  lanu it seemed to me that surp
and ligor were threatening you
openly exclaimed mara anxiously

  they are too insolent that is all
crain answered though he was still
tense from that deadly clash

  be careful lanu pleaded the
princess her dark eyes deeply wor-
ried you know how much surp
wants your throne and how much li-
gor wants-me

  crain started so ligor was in love
with mara he might have guessed
it from the eager way in which ligor
had hung about her before the draw-
ing of the lots

  i wish i knew what devils web
surp is weaving dandor was whis-
pering forebodingly hes got some-
the prisoner of mars



thing planned now that he knows the
truth about you

  crain moved down the steps toward
the great central stage as he reached
its edge the nobles behind him
stopped forbidden to go further
only royalty could stand on that
stage dandor had said-only royalty
and the chosen victims crain and
mara their royal crimson cloaks
gleaming brilliantly under the hood-
ed lights walked slowly across the
stage toward the altar

  crain took his place by the red
metal standard that rose near the crys-
tal disk of the altar mara stood near
him her dark head erect and her beau-
tiful face white

and the whole great temple was
silent silent the stillness of
death had invaded the vast shadowy
fane no one spoke no one moved
only the drifting glowing electrae
wandered aimlessly through the semi-
dusk

  philip crain felt a slow cold chill
of deeper horror invade him as he
looked at the great crowd of victims
that stood near him on the stage if
they had been weeping protesting
raging it would not have been so bad
he felt

  but they were utterly still and si-
lent men women and children their
faces a white blur in the shadows
watching him with dull apathetic
hopelessness a little child among
the doomed ones whispered and its
mother soothed it and the tide of
awful silence rushed back over every-

thing

  philip crain started to speak the
words that dandor had taught him
they came thick and hoarse

  you who must now pass into the
electrae he said to the white-faced
band must not feel that you are
doomed to stay everlastingly in that
state no when our world is revived
by new water then will you and all
the rest of the electrae be trans-
formed by this very altar back into
living men and women let that
thought comfort you now as you pass
out of life and be comforted also by
the knowledge that you are saving the
rest of our race by leaving us and
in a day to come when our world is
again green and fertile when you
electrae are made living men once
more all our world will be grateful
to you for this that you now do

  crain ended the speech the ritual
speech that the kings of bara had
spoken for many years to the doomed

  the doomed ones were still silent
still watching him with that dull
apathetic stare that made philip crain
shiver to the soul by its icy utter
hopelessness

  and then breaking the accustomed
ritual crain made the announcement
that dandor had said he must make

  and the time when all the electrae
will be released comes soon he de-
clared yes my people the great
plan that has been the dream of all
bara for ages shall soon be achieved
the road to cholu is now open at
last at this very moment a matter-

startling stories

caster is ready upon cholu for us to
use soon our expedition will flash
across the void to set up on cholu the
matter-casters that will hurl water
from that world to bara soon bara
will once more be a world of great
seas and fertile lands and then at last
all the millions of the electrae shall
pass through this altar and become
once more living men and women

 for a long moment there was a
dead frozen silence in the great tem-
ple a silence of stupefaction and
then from every throat in the vast
fane there ripped a colossal deafen-
ing shout of frantic joy a mighty cry
that beat upon philip crain with stun-
ning force

  king lanu yelled those thou-
sands of frenzied voices king lanu
our liberator

 mara was clutching wildly at
crains arm

  is it true lanu she cried over
that deafening joy-mad uproar is
it true

  its true mara he said dandor
and i have opened the road to cholu

tears shone in her dark eyes
bright tears of gladness

  our people-the electrae-saved
she choked

  still the joy-mad frantic uproar of
shouts beat wildly down upon crain

 lanu lanu the people were
crying hoarsely and the doomed
ones who a moment before had been
apathetic with dead hopelessness
were shouting loudest in their fren-
zied joy

  and philip crain felt-increased
horror for he knew that if he suc-
ceeded in what he meant to do all
these wildly rejoicing people were
doomed to agonizing disappointment

 he must himself destroy their
dream whose promised fulfillment had
sei them mad with gladness he
whom they were wildly hailing now as
their savior must be the one to shatter
their frenzied hope

  tortured by that knowledge unable
to bear more of their frantic acclaim
he raised his hand for silence

  soon he repeated the great plan
will be achieved and then all the elec-

trae will be released but now these
of the chosen must pass into the elec-
trae since we will need all the re-
sources of our dying world for the
expedition to cholu

  a big man among the chosen his
face flaming with joy shouted in an-
swer we go gladly now into the
electrae highness yes now that
we know we are soon to be released
we do not flinch from the altar

 aye king lanu chorused the
doomed men and women around him
faces shining we know that soon
you will release us all

  philip crain shuddered this glad
trust in him was almost unbearable

  your trust in me will be fulfilled
he said hoarsely hating himself for
the lie now let the ceremony
begin

  he reached to the little wheels
mounted on the red metal standard be-
fore him he turned them setting
each at a certain position as dandor
had carefully instructed

  as he set the last wheel the crystal
disk of the altar blazed suddenly with
violent purple light an upward-
shooting shaft of deep violet bril-
liance that cast a quivering glow over
the faces of all in the temple

  the altar is ready said crain his
voice thick and unsteady pass into
it in the order established among
you

  the doomed ones began to move in
a single file toward the blazing purple
shaft men and women with babies
in arms toddling children advancing
to the altar

  as the first man reached it he
paused and looked toward crain his
quivering face shining with gladness

  bless you king lanu for giving
us promise of early release before we
enter the altar he cried

  and then he stepped into the blaz-
ing shaft of purple force instantly
his bodys outlines wavered were
misty were gone from sight he
vanished-and out of the blazing
shaft drifted a thing of glowing light

  an electrae-that had been that liv-
ing man drifting aimlessly away
now with the other electrae in the
shadowy temple
the prisoner of mars



crain found himself shaking with
horror as he witnessed that in-
credible and awful transformation
and his horror increased as one by
one in single file the rest of the
doomed marched into the purple shaft
of the altar

  for as they entered the deadly
force the faces of them all were
turned toward him with beaming trust
and joy and they were crying out
their blessing on him blessing him
who meant to shatter their joyful
hopes blessing him with their last
words as they entered the living
death

  dozens scores hundreds of them
were passing thus into the altar each
of them as they entered the brilliant
purple shaft disappeared almost in-
stantly-changing into one of the fire-

men once more

  again the terrific clamor of acclaim
crashed down upon him to crains
self-tormented soul it was like the
howling of mocking demons

  all the way back across the plaza to
the palace the throng that had poured
out of the temple were shouting in
hoarse acclaim hailing crain guards
struggled to hold them back

  when crain and dandor and mara
entered the palace the princess looked
up at crain her dark eyes tear-misted

 lanu you and dandor will be
blessed by every soul that is ever
born on bara she said a throb in
her voice for opening the road to
cholus water for renewing our
world and freeing the electras

  her warm arms went impulsively
around his neck her eyes were

fly things that floated off into the

  electrae were thick now in the great
temple horde of them drifting about
electrae that moments before had
been men with wild eyes philip
crain watched the last of the trustful
joyful victims pass into the altar saw
those last ones float off as immaterial
electric things

  then his hand shaking he reached
and turned the little wheels the
blaze of the altar died

 the ceremony is ended he said
hoarsely and continued as dandor
had instructed him and it will be
the last ceremony of its kind ever to
take place here no more of baras
children shall pass into the electrae
and soon all the electrae shall pass
back through this altar to be living

shining as she raised her face to his

  i did not think that i could ever
love you lanu she whispered but
last night-i learned differently and
now i know that you are worthy of
my new-found love

  even in his torment of soul a thrill
shot through crain it was he who
had won her love not lanu he
kissed her hungrily she clung to
him till dandor began to cough warn-
ingly

  she stepped back then her face
glowing tonight she whispered
and was gone crain stared shakenly
after her until dandors voice broke
the spell

your brothers fiancee remember

  i know crain said hoarsely then
suddenly cried i wish to god id
never entered this crazy imposture
you were magnificnt in the tem-
ple dandor approved the people
worship you as their savior now if we
can rescue lanu and get him back onto
the throne no plot of surps will ever
be able to shake his popularity the
old scientists face clouded as he
added surp and ligor left the tem-
ple before the ceremony ended i
wonder why

 to hell with surp crain ex-
claimed in abandon startling dandor

  when they entered the royal apart-
ments the old scientist uttered a sharp
cry

  something has happened to kro
the huge robot lay unmoving on
the floor nearby a small unfamiliar
triangular mechanism was buzzing

 someones been here dandor
cried in alarm that little mechan-
ism-they overpowered kro with it
somehow

  wheres kay cried crain

  he dashed through the rooms he
came back his face dead white

  shes gone dandor shes been
kidnaped like the king

       chapter xiii
       in ruined llon

stunned by this new blow
philip crains lean dark face
was suddenly haggard with anxiety
kay gone kidnaped

  surp is behind this dandor was
shouting the old scientists black
eyes were flaming

  but why in gods name would surp
want to kidnap kay crain cried

  dandor did not answer at once he
was bending over the small triangular
mechanism that buzzed steadily on
the floor with deft skilled hands he
began dissembling the buzzing little
machine

 as i thought he exclaimed
this mechanism emits a field of force
which dampens and neutralizes the

electric nerve-currents of kros body
kros brain and nervous system are
electrical you see krayn his artifi-
cial brain is a complex of metal neu-
rones which controls the photo-elec-
tric power that animates his body
and the field of this little mechanism
effectively dampens his electric men-
tal currents

  dandor paused suddenly in his dis-
sembling of the little machine and
looked up his wrinkled face startled

  but who upon bara could have de-
vised a super-cunning mechanism like
this he muttered in perplexity
there is no baran scientist except
myself in these decadent days who
could have done it is it possible that
there is some great baran scientist of
whom i do not know who is working
for surp

  as dandor completed dissembling
the little mechanism its buzzing
stopped instantly kro rose to his
feet

  ligor and some of surps men did
this the robot declared i saw them
enter-then i knew nothing

 why would surp kidnap kay
crain cried again how did he even
know of her existence

  he must have learned from lanu
that a girl came with you from cholu
dandor muttered thoughtfully his
eyes flashed i begin to see now
surp holds lanu but while you fill
lanus place surp cannot seize
power so guessing that this choluan
girl is dear to you surp has seized
her so as to have a hold on you he
will doubtless threaten to kill the girl
unless you do as he wishes

  crain was appalled haggard and
pale with anxiety kay little kay in
black danger-and it was he who had
unwittingly brought her into this
peril

  im going to llon he said his
face set surp will have kay there
with lanu

  she will be there with lanu yes
dandor agreed and we will have
the advantage of surprise for surp
cannot guess that we know where his
secret stronghold is

  i will go there alone dandor
crain declared one man can do as
the prisoner of mars



much as two and you must stay
here so that if surp tries to seize the
throne therell be someone to prevent
it

  crain was thinking desperately that
if he could get kay out of that hell-
nest in llon he would speed with
her to dandors desert tower and use
the matter-caster to flash back to
earth once there he could see to it
that earth and its coveted water was
safe forever

  he forced from his mind remem-
brance of the pitiful electrae those
tragic hordes of drifting electric
ghosts who had been men he must
think of earth he told himself
fiercely that was why he did not
want dandor with him for the old
scientist would oppose his plan with
all his might

ou are right krayn dandor
said worriedly i must remain
here to ward off any coup that surp
might attempt in your absence but
kro shall go with you

  crain made no objection to that he
felt that he could get rid of the robot
without difficulty when necessary

  the sun was setting the old man
sent kro out to make ready a worm
while crain hastily changed into a
metal tunic and helmet like those of
the baran soldiery flinging the crim-
son cloak over them

  dandor gave him a gas-gun and a
tiny watchlike mechanism whose use
the old scientist explained

  you must go secretly by the win-
dow dandor said surps spies
must be watching your movements
his voice broke a little and my
hopes go with you krayn if you
and kro save lanu tonight you save
the throne of your fathers the new
bara that is to be from surp
goodby dandor crain said
hoarsely if we dont meet again
try to remember me as a friend

  he dropped from the window into
the darkness silently he moved along
the shadow of the vast palace wall to
the rear courts

  the chill of the martian night was
nipping to his left the west gardens
lay dark and silent drifting electrae

moving through trees and flowers like
wandering stars kabu the nearer
moon was hurtling up into the south-
western heavens

  crain glanced back at the vast pile
of the palace its twin spires looming
against the fretted stars palace of
his fathers that he was looking on for
the last time he saw the glowing
windows of the east wing and felt
sick heartache at the thought of mara
waiting there for him never to see
her again never again to hold her in
his arm-

  he forced that thought from his
mind kays safety and the safety of
earth depended on him

  in an outer court a great worm
glistened in the moonlight he
climbed in and found kro already at
the controls

  start at once crain ordered for
llon

  the streets of ingomar were flaring
with light crowded with rejoicing
people tonight as the worm glided
rapidly through the city

  hail king lanu savior of bara
hundreds of voices were shouting in
jubilant excitement lanu

  crain felt his heartsickness deepen
these people little dreaming at this
moment that he was leaving ingomar
with the ultimate objective of shatter-
ing their age-old dream by cutting
them off from earth and its water for-
ever-

  the dim expanse of the desert
stretched before them as they passed
out of the city it was a dreamlike
vista under the nearer moon with
scattered electrae wandering above it
kro opened up the power and the
worm shot like a great rushing snake
over the vague sands

  crain leaned toward his unhuman
metal companion

  teach me how the worm is driven
kro he commanded he had sud-
denly remembered that he would need
to know that if he and kay were to get
to dandors tower later

  kro instructed him crain found
the controls of the worm simplicity
itself-one lever that controlled the
direction of its movement another
that controlled its speed through the

startling stories

power-plant and a third lever that
could cause the worm to rear its front
half erect into the air like a cobra for
purposes of observation or to pass
over obstacles

two hours passed as man and
robot sped southeastward in the
machine kabu changing phase with
bewildering rapidity as it hurtled
across the sky was already sinking
eastward and noru the farther
smaller moon was rising slowly to re-
place it

  far ahead against the bright silver
shield of setting kabu stood out a
cluster of tiny black towers

  llon breathed crain his body
tensing go slowly now kro and
try to keep out of sight

  like a hunting serpent the worm
crept toward the distant towers the
robot kept it as much as possible
under the shadow of sandy ridges and
dunes out of the moonlight

  stop here crain ordered finally
well go ahead on foot

  leaving the worm in the shadow of
a tall ridge he and kro emerged
they moved cautiously up to the ridge
and crouched there a moment survey-
ing the ruined city

  llon lay black and lonely beneath
the silver moons far to east and west
stretched the unlighted mass of its
crumbling towers and streets perched
upon the edge of a great depression
in the desert that had once been a deep
sea time had shattered its proud
towers choked its streets with fallen
masonry made dust of those who once
had walked its busy ways

  the spell of the solemn ruined city
clutched at philip crains heart for
through the shattered towers and
black streets moved the drifting stars
of many electrae floating aimlessly
it was like an epitome of the tragedy
of mars this dead metropolis of long
ago that now was peopled only by the
electric phantoms

  he drew from his pocket the little
watchlike instrument dandor had
given him it was a tiny direction-
finder super-sensitive to electro-
magnetic emanations if the tracer
that dandor had put in surps worm

were still there this finder would lead
him straight to surps hidden strong-
hold

  a tiny arrow of light glowed on the
transparent face of the finder as he
touched its stem a little shining ar-
row that pointed into the left section
of the abandoned city

  this way kro whispered crain
rising

  kros metal body gleamed like silver
underneath the moons as he moved
with crain through the ruined city

  keep in the shadows crain
whispered

  they clambered over piles of fallen
stone broken pillars and columns
corroded metal wrecks following the
finders shining arrow then a square
black castlelike structure that still
seemed in fair preservation bulked
darkly ahead and the shining arrow
of the finder pointed straight toward
it

  surps stronghold crain whis-
pered excitedly and itll be
guarded

  he drew his gas-gun clutching the
silvery tube by its trigger end then
he and kro moved on toward the
brooding lightless castle

  studying it from behind a nearby
ruin crain could see no guards at its
entrances he decided that surp was
so sure of the secrecy of his strong-
hold that he had been negligent that
made things easier

  more boldly philip crain moved
toward the building gas-gun ready
to fire he approached its open dark
arched entrance he and kro entered
a dust-covered broad stone corridor
dark except for the floating glow of a
few electrae

kro stopped suddenly i sense
someone here the robot said in
metallic whisper

  men asked crain anxiously

  no not men answered the robot
i cannot sense men this is someone
electrical like myself i cannot under-
stand it

  we mustnt dally here crain said
tautly come on

  something big and vaguely gleam-
ing showed in the darkness ahead it
the prisoner of mars



proved to be three worms parked in
a court in one of them crain knew
must be the tracer that had guided
him hither

  see-tracks in the dust kro was
whispering they lead down those
stairs

  the stairs descended into an utter
darkness but kros lens-eyes were
capable of seeing by infra-red light
he led the way his metal feet sound-
less now in the maze of dark corri-
dors they groped forward

  here are tracks of the girls feet
kro murmured this way

  his left hand touching the robots
cold metal side crain went forward
he could see and hear nothing his
heart was beginning to pound

  kro stopped crain felt a closed
door

  she is in here the robot whis-
pered i hear her breathing

  crain could not hear but he had
faith in the robots super-sensitive
senses

  kay he whispered frantically

  a sudden stir beyond the door came
to his ears then a choking voice

  philip j

  he tried the door it was locked

  kro try to open it he said tautly
then whispered again to the girl be
quiet kay well have you out in a
moment

  philip to think i doubted you he
heard her sobbing i thought you
had turned martian had forgotten
earth and me

  listen kro whispered suddenly

  crain heard a dim rustling sound in
the darkness strangely blood-chilling
something cold touched his leg

  he reached down in the darkness
his fingers felt the thing as a long
thick rope of flexible metal it was
moving of its own accord was wrap-
ping itself swiftly around his legs
and others were gliding up like metal
pythons to encircle his arms

  uttering a choking cry of horror
crain sought to free himself from
those weirdly living tightening metal
ropes he heard kro struggling furi-
ously against similar things and
more and more of them were coiling
around the two

  crushed by those tightening
strands crain could not move a
muscle the gas-gun had been
squeezed out of his hand he fell
helplessly and heard kros great
metal body crash to the floor beside
him

  lights blazed suddenly around
them and crain lying hopelessly
bound by those metal ropes that still
sought to tighten on him glimpsed
kro lying near him similarly bound
making herculean efforts to break his
bonds

  caught cried crain it was a
trap

  a mocking laugh fell upon his ears
ligor and a half-dozen armed men
were approaching along the corridor
the handsome young noble stood
hands on hips looking down at crain
with triumph  in his heavy-lidded
eyes

ltes it was a trap sir impos-
jl tor ligor laughed taunt-
ingly and you walked right into it
the brain said that you would and it
was right as always

  the brain where crain swiftly
wondered had he heard that strange
name before

  he was feeling the bitterness of
death not for himself for death
might almost be welcome since it
would solve for him the problem of
loyalty to two conflicting worlds that
had tormented him but kay-kay
helpless here-

  pick him up and bring him along
to my father ligor ordered his men
put the robot in one of the cells the
tighteners will hold him

  crain felt himself lifted roughly
and carried along the lighted corridor
he heard kay cry frantically

  he was taken through several dusty
corridors and chambers ligor strid-
ing ahead they emerged into a large
octagonal stone hall blazing with
lights

  there were more men here-surps
guards at the door and a dozen other
pale men dressed in cowled gray robes
busy at unfamiliar mechanisms and
apparatus that crowded the hall on a
platform at one end of the hall stood


startling stories

what crain at first glance took to be a
huge complex machine in front of it
surps green-cloaked massive figure
waited

  so the tighteners snared our man
ligor surp said his hard face light-
ing with grim pleasure

  easily ligor laughed carelessly
the people of cholu cant be very
clever if this half-breed is an example
he walked right into the castle

  a deep hollow and booming voice
spoke from behind surp

  bring the choluan closer it com-
manded flatly

  crain felt a chill of amazement
that boomng voice had come from the
huge machine behind surp

 now he saw in the front of
that machine five glowing disks
mounted on flexible stalks they had
turned toward crain like watching
eyes and from a large diaphragm
beneath those quintuple glowing eyes
had come the booming voice

 do as the brain commands
snapped surp

 the brain hearing that name
again crain suddenly remembered
what dandor had told him of a super-
robot a tremendous thinking-machine
that had been constructed long ago
and then destroyed because it had
grown too crafty

  was this it-this vast and complex
mechanism that loomed behind surp
this mighty machine that seemed liv-
ing thinking watching him

      chapter xiv
      cunning of the brain

rigid his bound form held help-
lessly erect by the guards
philip crain stared at that vast enig-
matic thing

  the brain he whispered the
thinkingmachine dandor told me of
but that was destroyed he said
surp laughed with hard complacent
satisfaction

  no not destroyed the nolle said
the brain was too valuable to be
destroyed when the destruction of

the robots was carried out i substitut-
ed a lifeless dummy mechanism for
the brain and brought the real brain
here it has lived here my ally ever
since

  yes spoke the booming unhuman
voice from the diaphragm i have
helped you much surp never would
you have climbed within reach of the
throne but for my craft to aid you

 i have kept my part of the bar-
gain surp shrugged facing the five
glowing eyes of the machine i have
given you the leisure and facilities for
experiment you desired have given
you these servitors you agreed that
facilities for experiment were all you
wanted

 that is all that is desirable
boomed the brain only stupid hu-
mans plot and sweat for silly power
over each other a pure immortal
intellect like myself has no desire for
power but only for truth

  sweat stood out on crains brow as
he stared at the colossal incredible
entity that was speaking dazed his
eyes were taking in its details

  the core of the brain appeared to
be a great ovoid mass shielded by a
strong metal cover crain guessed
that it consisted of a complex of
metal-neurones like kros brain but
one infinitely more complicated pos-
sessed of potential intellectual capa-
city and memory beyond those attri-
butes in any human

  upon this ovoid core played strong
white light or force from four tilted
projectors a soothing spray of vibra-
tions heavy cables led upward
through the ceiling to some hidden re-
ceiver of photo-electric power and
around this central scheme of ovoid
and projectors and cables rose the in-
t r i c a t e metal body of the brain
-a network of girders and joints
from which projected a full dozen
powerful jointed arms some ending
in claws others in fingers still others
in various tools and scientific instru-
ments

  all of these arms were now working
skillfully upon the assembling of a
large hemispherical machine the
enormous mental capacity of the
brain was evidenced by the fact that
the prisoner of mars



even while it was talking its many
arms were busy upon this task

  it could do several things at one
time as easily as a human genius
could play a number of chess-games
at once and crain now perceived
that of its quintuple glowing eyes one
appeared to be telescopic another
spectroscopic still another a micro-
scope and the remaining two de-
signed for ordinary stereoscopic
vision

  it was the brain choluan surp
was saying mockingly that devised
the little trap you have been caught
in the brain when it heard our
problem advised that we steal the
choluan girl lanu had told us of and
that you would come here to save her
we knew you would know where to
come for the brain had detected the
presence of that tracer dandor put in
my worm

crain was stunned overwhelmed
was any human ingenuity of
avail against that monstrous metal
mind

 and now we have you surps
voice flared triumphant now the
way is clear for me to return to ingo-
mar and seize the throne it is i not
tharkols spawn who will lead the
forces of bara to cholu by the road
that is now open it is i who will
procure from cholu the water that
will make bara green and great
again

 youre not on the throne yet
surp he spat hotly the people are
still to be heard from

  the people surp repeated smil-
ing confidently why choluan the
people will flock to my standard when
i tell them that lanu has been acci-
dentally killed the dear people will
follow anyone who would bring new
water to bara so that the electrae
can be released

 he laughed uproariously as
though i would ever release the elec-
trae but theyll think that i will

  crain stared at the massive nobles
brutally triumphant face in new
horror

  you mean crain cried unbeliev-
ingly that even if bara is revived

you wouldnt release the electrae
of course i wouldnt surp de-
clared why man the electrae are
full of my enemies for years and
years ive seen to it that the people
who supported tharkols house the
people who hated me were chosen to
be electrae and that none of my sup-
porters were chosen thats why my
popularity has increased i let it be
whispered that surps supporters
were never chosen

  i dont believe you crain ex-
claimed you could never devise any
way to tamper with the drawing of
the lots to achieve such a fraud
surp grinned i couldnt devise a
way no he admitted but the brain
could and did a cunning apparatus
that interferes with the secret wave-
lengths of the little balls used in the
drawing so that no matter what balls
are cast into the sphere of the chosen
it is the badges of my enemies that
glow forth thats how for years
ive filled the electrae with my
enemies and thats why the electrae
will never be released if i have any-
thing to do with it

  crain felt a sick horror worse than
any he had yet experienced this
disclosure by surp of the monstrous
fraud in the drawing of the lots the
open avowal of the noble that he
meant to betray the electrae chilled
crains blood

  he saw now the dreadful future in
store for both earth and mars for
earth the looting of its water the
making of it into a desert world and
for mars the revival of the planet but
with the rule of surp fastened in iron
tyranny upon it and the electrae
doomed to remain forever unfreed

  crain shook to a rage that was like
a white flame inside he tried madly
to break his bonds

  work away sir impostor drawl-
ed ligor with indolent amusement
youll never break the tighteners
ligor we go now to ingomar
surp said his shrewd eyes flashing
neither lanu nor this impostor half-
brother of his now sits on the throne
of bara now we strike he
turned to the guards you will do
with this choluan impostor as the


startling stories

brain directs our metal friend is
anxious to learn more about choluan
physiology

philip crain understood he
was to be given to that merciless
metal intellect as a subject for experi-
ment but in his rage he could not
now feel concern over his own fate

  wait surp boomed the hollow
voice of the brain you have for-
gotten dandor

  dandor surp exclaimed turned
to his son was dandor not with
this choluan and the robot

  ligor shook his head no father
surp cursed that old fox of a
scientist-too wary to come into our
trap

 dandor knows you hold lanu
here the brain reminded him if
you try to take the throne now dan-
dor will rouse the people with the
story of your kidnaping of lanu and
in spite of your many supporters the
issue may go against you

  surp glared in baffled anger it is
true he said tightly if dandor
cries to the people that i abducted
lanu the populace will turn against
us

  let us take the chance anyway
ligor exclaimed he was unafraid

  but his father turned back toward
the watching glowing eyes of the
massive machine

  what do you advise surp asked
the brain

  this is my advice boomed the
brain when you go to ingomar
take the real lanu with you put him
on his throne again let him lead the
expedition to cholu once on cholu
you can kill him and return to bara
with the story that he was killed in
fighting you will then be acclaimed
king without opposition

  crain saw surps eyes narrow it
would be a good plan surp said but
we dare not take lanu back to his
throne now after kidnaping him his
first act would be to order us arrested
for having abducted him

  not if you do as i say the brain
boomed tell lanu that you abduc-
ted him only to save him from a plot
made by dandor and this choluan to

put the choluan on the throne as
loyal subjects you kidnaped lanu to
save him from the plotters lanu will
believe that and you will also turn
him against whatever dandor may
say

  as always you clear my path
surp cried to the monstrous machine
then he shouted to the guards
bring king lanu here-with re-
spect

 philip crain stood helpless
astounded by the diabolical ingenuity
of the scheme the brain had proposed

  the guards reentered and with
them walked lanu his white tunic
was soiled and torn and fear was in
his weak irresolute face as he faced
surp then surprise flashed over
lanus features as he saw crain stand-
ing bound and helpless

  my half-brother from cholu he
exclaimed has surp caught you
too

  before crain could reply surp
stepped quickly forward and bowed
respectfully to lanu

  your pardon highness for the
roughness weve had to use with you
he asked we could not be too con-
siderate for there was little time in
which to save your life

lanu laughed bitterly you
abducted me then and have kept
me prisoned in that dusty cell for two
days to save my life a likely story

  it is the truth highness surp
swore had we not brought you here
forcibly without taking time to ex-
plain to you you would have been a
dead man now

  theyre lying to you lanu crain
shouted furiously they plan to get
you to earth and then-

  silence that half-breed i snapped
surp a guard swiftly clapped a big
hand over philip crains mouth

 that mongrel half-brother of
yours and the old scientist dandor
highness surp said were in a plot
to kill you and put the half-breed on
the throne

  i dont believe it lanu declared
dandor has been the most loyal sup-
porter of our house since long be-
fore i was born
the prisoner of mars



  yet its the truth highness surp
insisted dandor has long been pre-
paring it communicating secretly
with your choluan half-brother and
finally bringing him to bara then
dandor summoned you in secret to his
desert tower he meant to murder
you there and put your half-brother
on the throne as you but i had
heard rumors of the plot i sent my
men and they snatched you out of
dandors tower in the nick of time
as it is dandors plot almost suc-
ceeded anyway for dandor went
boldly ahead and put this krayn this
mongrel choluan on your throne
yes for two days your half-brother
has been taking your place in ingo-
mar impersonating you see he still
wears your royal cloak

  lanu stiffened as he saw the crim-
son cloak that hung from the shoul-
ders of the helpless crain

  by the gods if this is true lanu
swore anger creeping into his eyes
if this by-blow of my fathers has
dared trade on his resemblance to me
to sneak onto my throne-

  you will learn its truth when you
reach ingomar surp declared
youll learn that while we kept you
locked up here for safety this krayn
has strutted in your place

  aye drawled ligor he has even
dared take your place with princess
mara our spies saw them upon her
balcony last night in each others
arms

  lanus anger exploded into blind-
ing rage when he heard that

  you dared do that he snarled at
crain you a creature from cholu
unfit to touch maras sandal

  he would still be sitting on your
throne surp declared if we had not
struck for your cause tonight we
kidnaped him secretly from the palace
and brought him here and now you
can go back highness-the true king
returning

  crain heard the diabolically in-
genious lies that the brain had de-
vised without ability to contradict
as he struggled vainly to free himself
he saw that lanu was accepting the
whole fabric of deception for lanu
turned to surp gratitude in his eyes

  you have saved my throne from a
hellish plot surp he declared
you whom i always deemed an
enemy to my house well i know
now who my real friends and enemies
are dandor shall die for his part in
this

 and your half-brother surp
asked quickly as lanu hesitated
remember highness his resem-
blance makes him a danger to you as
long as he lives

 keep him captive here lanu
ordered until i decide his fate i
cannot order his death too hastily
for after all he is my fathers son

surp nodded he shall be kept
safely prisoned here then surp
agreed smoothly now we go to
ingomar highness for we must begin
preparations for the expedition to
cholu

  lanus eyes lit yes now that the
road to cholu is open through the
matter-casters we must not delay
philip crain saw the hidden smiles
on the faces of surp and ligor and he
groaned if he could only tell lanu
that they meant to kill him on earth
that they meant never to release the
electrae-

  suddenly the hollow voice of the
brain boomed out through the octa-
gonal hall

  one thing more said the great
mechanical intellect you know
surp that i probed the mind of the
choluan girl today so that i might
learn from it the nature of choluan
weapons and devise a mechanism that
would render them useless

  i know surp said impatiently
glancing at the great hemispherical
thing on which the brains arms were
working you will have the anti-
catalyzer ready before we leave for
cholu will you not

  it will be ready yes the brain
promised but what i wish to tell
you is that when i probed the girls
mind i learned that those who stand
by the matter-caster on cholu will
only turn it on upon hearing her voice
or this mans you must take the girl
with you therefore so that she can
speak to those on cholu and have them


startling stories

turn their matter-caster on when you
are ready

  bring the girl then surp
ordered

  two of the gray-cowled servitors
of the brain hastened out when they
returned with kay her face blanched
as she saw crain bound and gagged
but when surp told her what they
expected of her she flamed defiance

  i wont do it she cried ill die
before ill call to father to turn on
that machine so that you martians
can go through to earth with me

  a little torture will soon bring her
around ligor drawled

  crain writhed in fury but the
brains hollow booming voice broke
in

  no torture will break this girls
spirit but i can make her do the
thing willingly bring her before
me

  horror was in kays white face as
the cowled servitors thrust her in
front of the five glowing eyes of the
monstrous mechanism

  look into my eyes boomed the
brains heavy voice look- flecks
of red swirled and seethed in the
glowing eyes of the brain

  the cowled servitors released her
but she remained standing staring
fixedly into the quintuple shining
eyes of the mechanical mind

  you will obey my commands
boomed the brain

  i will obey repeated kay her
face mask-like her eyes blank

  when these men order you you
will call those on cholu to open their
matter-caster the brain said

  i will call them kay repeated
stonily

  now go with your masters the
machine told her she turned obedi-
ently empty eyes staring unseeingly

  lanu was gazing in horror at the
massive machine that had just hypno-
tized the girl

hat thing he muttered is
it not the thinking robot the
brain that was supposed to have been
destroyed years ago

  it is highness surp said quickly
and well for you that it was not

destroyed since the brains help en-
abled me to foil dandors plot that
was why dandor ordered the brain
destroyed he feared it might be able
to thwart his plots against your
house

  if the thing has aided me very
well lanu said yet he shuddered i
do not like such monsters then his
eyes were alight again we go now
to ingomar-and soon to cholu
come

  helpless unable to voice a word
philip crain watched his duped half-
brother stride out followed by surp
and the stiffly-moving hypnotized
kay and the guards

  he had lost everything both the
worlds to which he owed loyalty were
destined to disaster-earth to become
a looted desert mars to become sub-
ject to the tyranny of surp

  ligor had remained behind and
there was a taunting smile in his
heavy-lidded eyes as he said
farewell sir impostor i leave you
to the mercies of the brain and i
tell you one thing-when lanu is dead
and my father rules bara i am to
have the princess mara whether
she wills it or not she is to be mine
let that thought comfort you as you
die

chapter xv
creature and creator

feeling hands lifting him crain
came slowly out of restless tor-
mented sleep he was still in the
dusty cell in which he had been pris-
oned for the last four days and the
gray-cowled servitors of the brain
were now lifting him upon a wheeled
table

  he struggled but without avail
his arms and legs were still tightly
bound with the self-contracting metal
ropes called the tighteners crain
had learned that the tighteners were
really nothing but ingenious magnetic
mechanisms controlled by the brain
itself

  the brain is ready to examine you
the prisoner of mars



now choluan one of the gray-
cowled servitors told him

 damn you muttered crain
thickly if my hands were loose-

  he knew that it must be night again
for he had kept track of hours and
days during his captivity and as
they wheeled him along dusty lighted
stone corridors he could hear a wail-
ing and groaning coming muffled
from overhead speaking of a great
wind-storm that was buffeting ruined
llon

  crain had known a torturing agony
of spirit in his cell thinking of what
must be going on in ingomar the
great expedition would be preparing
to flash across the gulf to earth lanu
going blindly to his doom and surp
ready to grasp the power

  crains eyes were blinded by the
blaze of light as he was wheeled into
the great octagonal hall the gray-
clad servitors wheeled him to the
stone dais on which the brain rested
the hemispherical mechanism on
which the brain had been working
was gone now its five glowing eyes
stared at crain and its booming voice
reverberated above the muffled roar of
the storm

  i am now able to examine you
choluan it boomed to the helpless
earthman since i have now finished
the anti-catalyzer that surp will take
with him to cholu i expect to learn
much about that worlds creatures
from you

  damn you why dont you kill me
and get it over with raged crain
glaring up into the quintuple shining
eyes

  because the brain explained
coolly your dead body interesting as
it will be to dissect will tell me much
less about choluan life and its differ-
ences from baran life than your liv-
ing body can tell me a man in my
position might possibly feel the emo-
tion called pity and grant your desire
for a quick death men are ruled by
their turbid emotions and that is why
they learn so little in their short lives
but to me an immortal intellect un-
encumbered with distracting emo-
tions nothing is of importance but the
search for truth which will occupy

me long ages after all your ephemeral
race has vanished

  four of the intricately-jointed arms
of the brain were reaching toward
crains helpless form one arm ended
in a glittering scalpel another in a
fine crescent - shaped saw and the
other two held swabs

  i want samples of tissue and bone
from you first the brains metallic
voice said they may help substan-
tiate an interesting theory which i
have formed since i learned that
cholu is inhabited by a race of men
essentially similar to the baran race

crain closed his eyes to stand the
agony as the scalpel stabbed the
flesh of his upper arm and the brains
hollow voice boomed on as the thing
worked

  it is coming to be my theory the
brain was saying that the men of
cholu and the men of bara are
branches of the same parent human
stock the resemblances between the
two species are so great as to tolerate
no other solution but where did that
parent human stock originate

  i believe it originated upon a
planet which once existed between
bara the fourth world from the sun
and orkol the giant fifth world the
great numbers of asteroids in that belt
of space are clearly the fragments of
a planet that was shattered by internal
cataclysm upon that planet long
ago must have originated the ances-
tors of both choluans and barans

  my telescopic investigation of the
fragments of that shattered world have
convinced me that that planet met its
end from a cataclysmic release of un-
controllable atomic energy this ar-
gues a high state of scientific powers
for its inhabitants and such a race
would have had no difficulty in col-
onizing both bara and cholu when
the parent world was destroyed the
colonists upon these two worlds
doubtless sank into such savagery that
the memory of their racial past disap-
peared and thus-

  the fine saw was rasping at crains
bone scraping away a small sample
the nauseating agony of that made
crains consciousness whirl and fade


startling stories

  through dimming ears he heard the
brain boom an order to the cowled
servitors

  revive the subject before i take
the next samples of tissue he must
not sink into coma

  crain dimly realized that he was be-
ing wheeled to a far corner of the
great hall then a sensation of cold in-
vaded his pain-racked brain as a cool-
ing chemical spray was played upon
his face and that sensation suddenly
detonated a terrific idea in his dizzy
brain a tremendous inspiration that
burst like a starshell in his mind as he
felt that snowlike cooling spray

 he opened his eyes the brain
was already making microscopic anal-
ysis of the samples of bone tissue
while it awaited crains revival

  the two cowled men had left crain
for a moment his mind whirled with
crazy soaring excitement

  my god ive found it he whis-
pered hoarsely and it means life to
both worlds

  yes it had crashed into his dimmed
brain as he revived from the torture
-that tremendous inspiration a way
that would give water in plenty to
mars without harming earth in the
slightest

  crains mind rocked with the joy of
his discovery the conflict of loyal-
ties in his mind the conflict between
his terrestrial and martian blood was
over mars could be revived the elec-
trae could be freed without harming
earth he could be loyal now to both
his worlds

  and then black reaction crushed
down on him the inspiration had
come too late he was doomed to a
torturing death in this ghastly cham-
ber and his plan would never have a
chance

he closed his eyes to keep back
the bitter tears he felt one of
the cowled servitors bending over him
again but in his crushing despair he
paid no heed

  krayn open your eyes it is i

  that stealthy whisper galvanized
crain like an electric shock he knew
that voice

  he opened his eyes the cowled

 man bending over him-the face hid-
 den by the cowls shadow was wrin-
 kled old with burning black eyes

    dandor he choked

    quiet dandor whispered glanc-
  ing toward the end of the hall where
  the brain was busy with its absorbing
  analysis

    dandors hands were tugging at the
  metal tighteners around crain striv-
  ing to unloosen them

   i came for you krayn dandor
 murmured hoarsely i had to flee for
 my life four days ago when lanu re-
 turned with surp there was agony
 in the old mans whisper surp had
 turned lanu against me made him
 think i had plotted with you against
 him he would not listen to me but
 sentenced me to death i escaped be-
 fore the guards could seize me and
 hid for these four days in a secret
 place in ingomar a great sand-storm
 is blowing over bara tonight i
 escaped the city under cover of the
 storm and came here to free you and
 kro so that you could help me foil
 surps plot before the expedition goes
 to cholu

    as dandor frantically sought to un-
  loosen the tighteners crain anxious-
  ly whispered when does the expedi-
  tion leave

   tomorrow morning dandor an-
 swered an advance guard of baran
 soldiers has already gone through to
 cholu and holds the matter-caster
 there they used the hypnotized cho-
 luan girl to call those on cholu to turn
 on their matter-caster then the ad-
 vance guard went through with the
 girl they took with them parts with
 which to build a far bigger matter-
 caster on cholu a similar huge mat-
 ter-caster has been set up in the plaza
 of ingomar the equipment has all
 been ready for years-matter-casters
 worms mounted with great gas-guns
 everything lanu and surp will lead
 the expedition to cholu in the morn-
 ing

    crain blanched at that information

- barans already holding the earth end
  of the space-bridge lanu and surp
  and the main martian forces ready in
  a few hours to flash to earth

   the expedition must not start
the prisoner of mars



dandor crain whispered frantically
i have thought of a way by which
bara can be revived without robbing
cholu of water

  dandor froze staring down at him
you have such a plan he whis-
pered his eyes lit then we must
put it into effect we must not dev-
astate cholu if we can get water with-
out doing that

  he was hoarse with emotion if i
can get you out of here and we can
convince lanu-

  dont wait to free me you cant
loosen these tighteners for theyre
controlled by the brain itself go
back to ingomar and beg lanu   
look out dandor

  three cowled servitors had softly
approached behind dandor were fling-
ing tighteners around him the
metal strands instantly contracted
around the old scientist pinioning his
arms and legs

  caught groaned dandor

  the voice of the brain boomed from
the end of the hall

  bring them here it ordered

the cowled men wheeling crains
table and carrying the helpless
dandor obeyed in a moment dandor
and crain were helpless in front of the
brain

  the mechanisms quintuple glowing
eyes contemplated them crain felt
black despair this the chance that
for a moment he had hoped would suc-
ceed gone

  you are dandor the scientist
boomed the brain you were chief
of that committee of scientists who
created me long ago

  yes dandor said thickly his
wrinkled face deathly as he stared in-
to the glowing eyes

 you underestimate my powers
dandor when you seek to employ such
a crude stratagem as that the brain
declared if you had known that i
have so improved my senses that i can
hear every word spoken in this whole
ruined city you would not have been
so foolish as to whisper to your
friend

  dandor made no answer his burn-
ing eyes held by the five glowing orbs

of the metal monster in the taut si-
lence the shrieking clamor of the sand-
storm could be clearly heard raging
across the ruined metropolis above

  you understand of course said
the brain that your life is forfeit
for this intrusion

  i understand dandor said quiet-
ly yet i want to remind you of one
thing-it was i who directed your
creation more than any other man i
am responsible for your existence

  i am aware of that the brain re-
plied coldly but i trust that you
are not going to beg me for your life
on that ground you best of all men
should know that such emotions as
gratitude are wholly alien to my men-
tality

  i know that you have no emotions
dandor said coolly but i know
also that you have a super-logical
mind brain it is logic that will make
you spare the lives of myself and my
friend

  what logical reason can you ad-
vance to make me do such a thing
the brain inquired

  i am going to bargain with you
dandor answered tautly my life and
the lives of krayn and kro for some-
thing which i alone can tell you some-
thing that is of utter importance to
you

  the booming voice from the dia-
phragm came hollow and toneless as
ever but the words were derisive

  you bargain with me you an ag-
ing feeble creature of flesh and blood
bargain with me the immortal and age-
less intellect whose powers are beyond
even your comprehension

       chapter xvi
       chamber of death

lying helpless upon his table
crain felt the derision of the brain
echo through his own mind what
could dandor say or do to change the
monstrous mechanisms will

  dandor as he stood swaying with
arms and legs bound his thin form un-
steady his white hair disordered where


startling stories

the gray cowl had been pulled off
looked pitifully tiny and feeble beside
the huge complex metal mechanism
whose glowing eyes stared at him yet
in the old scientists face was calm
confidence

 you wish to bargain the brain
was booming then what can you
offer me for your lives

  i can offer you life brain was
dandors answer mental life the
only kind you care about

  you talk foolishly man said the
cold metallic voice how can you offer
me life when i am already immortal
my metal body watched over and re-
newed by myself at necessary intervals
cannot rot or die like a human body
and my mind embodied in the com-
plex metal neurones which you your-
self devised cannot die any more than
my body

 your mind cannot die i agree
dandor said calmly his eyes nar-
rowed but brain your mind can
cease to grow

  crain saw the flexible eye-stalks of
the brain twitch slightly as though
that suggestion had astonished even
the cold intellect of the machine

 what do you mean the brain
quickly demanded the cortex of
metal neurones that holds my mind is
of vast size and complexity there is
room in it for billions more synaptic
patterns vastly more knowledge how
can my mind cease to grow when there
is so much room in my brain for it to
grow in

  there is room yes dandor again
agreed but suppose the neurone
structure of your brain slowly crystal-
lized became rigid fixed unable to
record any more synaptic patterns any
more knowledge

  that cannot happen exclaimed the
brain

  it can happen and it will happen-
soon dandor affirmed with positive-
ness for you were so designed when
we created you brain that provision
was incorporated into you just as in
every other robots brain we ever made

  it was a provision inspired by cau-
tion the old scientist continued rap-
idly we wanted our robots to be able
to learn but not to learn too much so

we constructed the neurone structures
of their brains of a metal subtly al-
loyed so that after a certain period of
years it would crystallize and be un-
able to record further impressions in
that way we were sure that our robots
while they might be immortal physi-
cally would not go on learning and
acquiring power indefinitely

 your own brain dandor con-
cluded is so large and complex that
you have been able to acquire in these
years far more knowledge than any
robot we ever built you acquired so
much indeed in those first years that
we deemed it advisable not to wait for
the inevitable crystallization of your
brain but to destroy you and all the
other robots at once you have been
learning growing more powerful and
wise ever since you escaped that de-
struction but the time is almost at
hand when the metal neurones of your
brain will inevitably crystallize and
then you will be able to learn nothing
more

the quintuple eye-stalks of the
brain blinked in an almost human
horror

  to learn nothing more rasped
the great voice but that must not
be my life is of the intellect my
only motives for existence the endless
unfolding of new truths my immor-
tality would be a mockery if i ceased
to learn if what you say is true but
i do not believe you speak truth you
seek by a lie to persuade me to spare
you and your friend

  if you prove to your satisfaction
that i am speaking the truth dandor
asked calmly will you spare me and
my friend if i advise you how to avoid
this crystallization of your neur-
ones

  yes agreed the brain if you
are telling the truth about this i shall
let you and your companion and the
robot go free in return for your advice
as to how i am to avoid this fate
you have only to examine the cor-
tex of your brain dandor said and
you will find that the crystallization
has already begun

  i shall do that said the brain
we shall if you speak truly
the prisoner of mars



  the brains jointed metal arms
moved swiftly the sprays of vibra-
tion playing upon the huge ovoid mass
at its core were suddenly turned off
the jointed arms reached into the
complex metal body and began to re-
move the front plates of the ovoid
brain case crain felt a weird repul-
sion when the cortex the inmost mind
stuff of the brain lay naked and re-
vealed a huge spongy metal mass it
seemed wrinkled with numberless
folds and corrugations

  the brain turned the stalk of its
miscroscopic eye inward that glow-
ing magnifying eye scanning the
spongy metal mass of its own cortex
from a distance of a few inches dan-
dor was standing rigid

  i think you lie the brains deep
voice rumbled i can find no evi-
dence of-

  dandor acted the moment for
which the old scientist had waited had
come he threw his bound body for-
ward with frenzied effort

  his shoulder hit the curved metal
stalk of the microscopic eye with
which the brain was examining its
cortex and the impact drove that
eye and stalk deep into the spongy
metal mass of the great cortex

  ah-h-h-h screamed a horrible
booming uluation from the diaphragm

  death scream of the brain as its
cortex was riven by its own eye-stalk
the creatures myriad jointed arms
threshed furiously in crazy death
throes

  those metal arms flung dandor
across the hall as if he were a puppet
he struck the stone wall with a thud
and then the arms ceased their thresh-
ing the other glowing eyes of the
brain went black the unhuman death
scream ended

  and as the metal monster died
crain felt the metal bonds of the
tighteners relax no longer controlled
by their unhuman inventor

  they have killed the brain
screamed one of the gray-cowled
servitors

  slay them-the brain is dead
the others cried hoarsely as they
charged upon crain and the aged dan-
dor

 though his body was so stiff
 from long days in bondage that
 he could hardly stand crain hit out
 wildly and knocked down the first two
 of the onrushing maddened servitors

 he saw one of the others raising a
 gas-gun pointing it toward him

   then the door of the great hall
 crashed open and a terrible metallic
 cry rang through it the huge silver
 figure of kro the robot was bursting
 in kro who also had been freed of
 the tighteners when the brain died
 and who had smashed through doors
 like a battering-ram

   kros metal fist crashed down like
 trip-hammers pulping the skulls of
 the gray-clad servitors the robot
 had seemingly gone mad with rage
 was whirling his arms like giant metal
 maces killing killing killing   

   screaming the remaining servitors
 fled but with greater swiftness kro
 leaped after them and smote them
 down the last scream died and the
 robot came stalking back his metal
 arms red with blood

   crain had stumbled to where dan-
 dor lay against the stone wall the
 old mans body was broken and limp
 but his eyes were open black large
 strange they looked up at crain from
 his deathly face

   the brain he whispered from
 lips that hardly moved

   dead crain cried tears were
 running down his face

   a ghostly smile came into dandors
 pallid face i thought that i could
 trick it the dying scientist mur-
 mured with that lie about crystalli-
 zation of its cortex he might read
 the minds of others to know it was a
 lie but i who helped make his me-
 chanism knew how to close my mind
 to his probing

   dandor crain said hoarsely i
 must get you to help

   krayn listen whispered the old
 man trying to raise himself this
 plan of yours to renew bara without
 harming cholu-you must put that
 into effect my conscience has hurt
 me these last days at the thought that
 we must bring destruction to the
 people of cholu for the sake of our
 own world i can die easily now if i


startling stories

know that you will not allow that to
happen and that you will save bara
from surps tyranny you must go
quickly to ingomar before the
expedition leaves

  i will crain cried but you-

  dandors dimming eyes shifted to
the great robot

  kro he whispered

  yes master answered the metal-
lic voice was there something ach-
ing something almost human in it

  kro my most faithful friend and
servant you must take krayn as your
master now dandor whispered you
must obey him as you have obeyed
me

  yes master came the robots
reply

  dandors thin cold fingers touched
crains hand

  kfayn you are a worthy son of
tharkol i wish that you instead of
lanu-

  his voice trailed away in a sigh
his half-closed eyes stared emptily
his body suddenly still

  he is dead said crain fighting
back the blinding tears

  yes master said kro standing
motionless

  crain staggered to his feet we
shall give him burial later kro he
choked now we must hasten to
ingomar

the robots metal arm supported
crain as he stumbled out of that
chamber of appalling death as they
climbed the stairs toward the surface-
level the howling of the storm came
louder to their ears a shrieking and
wailing of winds almost deafened
crain as he and kro emerged into the
dark stone court where two worms
were parked

  kro helped him into one of the
vehicles and then the robot drove it
out into the night the full fury of
the storm bellowed down on them
drowning every other sound in its in-
sensate roar scourging the gliding
worm with blasts of wind-driven sand
that almost overturned it

  ruined llon towered ghostly
about them the two moons and the
stars were obscured by the screaming

sand that filled the air yet as the
worm groped blindly through the
tempest crain glimpsed scattered
hosts of the drifting firefly electrae
about them unaffected by the wind
and raging sand

  everything depends on my getting
to ingomar before the expedition goes
to earth kro crain cried hoarsely

  kro opened the power to the limit
like a shooting serpent of metal the
worm rushed forward through the
black blind fury of the tempest that
howled across the dying world

  as they raced through darkness
across the storm-swept desert crain
felt the agony of complete circulation
returning to his stiffened body he
fumbled to bind up the wound in his
arm

  his whole life seemed focused now
upon one possibility if the expedi-
tion had not gone yet-if lanu could
be made to listen-

  the minutes seemed like hours the
hours like eternities as the worm
fought on through the raging storm
anxiously crain peered ahead
would the lights of ingomar never
appear

      chapter xvii
      into the phantoms

vaguely crains haggard eyes
finally discerned lights shining
through the storm-driven sand and
night

  ingomar he cried faster
kro

  but the worm could go no faster
soon they were entering the city its
streets were deserted its looming
towers scourged by blasts of sand and
shrieking wind

  crain had told the robot to drive
toward the palace presently they
were circling around the great plaza
lights were flaring there and crain
saw the huge matter-caster that had
been set up on the plaza a colossal
crystal disk ringed with enormous
transformers it gleamed brightly
through the obscurity
the prisoner of mars



  around the matter-caster waiting
to be flashed from it in detachments
to the identical mechanism on earth
stood thousands upon thousands of
baran soldiers their helmets and
metal tunics gleaming under th-
lights many hundreds of the great
worms the ugly snouts of big gas-
guns protruding from their heads and
sides great piles of matter-caster
parts which had been ready for years
and which would form the machines
to hurl earths water to mars and a
big hemispherical machine which
crain recognized as the device the
brain had constructed to nullify
earth weapons the thing called an
anti-catalyzer

  thank god were here before the
expedition starts crain said hoarse-
ly theres still time to stop it

  to the palace door master kro
asked

  no drive to the gardens on the
east side of the palace crain ordered

  presently the robot stopped the
worm at the edge of the dark storm-
whipped gardens philip crain
hastily climbed out

  wait here in the gardens kro he
swiftly commanded and keep hidden
since the death sentence was passed
on dandor you his robot would be
destroyed if you were seen

  i will wait master answered the
robot imperturbably

  wind-whipped branches lashed his
face sand struck him in stinging
blinding blasts as crain plunged
toward the palace the gale tearing
through ingomar was a steady roar
around him as he staggered on
floated the wandering stars of the
drifting unaffected electrae

  at the rear entrance of the palace
guards flashed up their gas-guns as
crain approached

  halt there

  crain only came on so that the
light from within the entrance fell
upon his face

  the king cried an officer but
i thought you were inside with the
others highness

  stand aside crain ordered

  staring in amazement at his bloody
face and torn tunic the officer obeyed

  crain pitched through the entrance
down rosy soft-lit corridors toward
the royal apartment he heard a hum
of excited voices from within it as he
reached its door

  he flung the door open stood stag-
gering on its threshold every head
in the apartment turned toward him
there was a moment of frozen silence

  lanu stiffened with amazement
and surp and ligor who had been
talking earnestly to the king glared
at crain as though they could not be-
lieve their eyes a half dozen guards
nearby seemed even more struck with
consternation

but it was the princess mara
standing near lanu who seemed
most staggered by the shock of crains
appearance her hand went to her
throat her dark eyes dilated as she
saw the disordered bloody crain
standing there identical in face and
figure with the king

  crain pitched forward toward
lanu

  lanu wait he cried hoarsely
hear me before you lead that expedi-
tion to earth

  my half-brother lanu exclaimed
he has escaped from the brain
surp

  maras face paled as she heard the
kings words she looked distractedly
at lanu

  your half-brother she whispered

  crain saw now that she had known
nothing of the imposture lanu had
kept that secret even from her and
now seeing crain with lanu for the
first time understanding leaped into
her dark eyes

  your half-brother she repeated
then it was he who was king for
those two days when i-

  yes he dared impersonate me for
two days lanu exclaimed his amaze-
ment changing to rage at the remem-
brance he a half-breed from cholu
dared sit on my throne and even dared
make love to you mara

  hell not escape again declared
surp raging as he drew out his gas-
gun

  wait surp lanu exclaimed i
told you that he was not to be killed
startling stories

yet after all he is my fathers son

 crain disregarded the menacing
weapon in the hand of the raging no-
ble

  lanu listen to me he pleaded
hoarsely you must not take that ex-
pedition to earth it means your
death and it means devastation for
earth and slavery for bara i have a
plan-

  seize him surp cried to the star-
ing guards and men hastily gripped
philip crains staggering figure

  mara was still staring from crain to
lanu as though she could not credit
what she saw

  i will not listen to any more of
your lies lanu shouted at crain
you who dared usurp my throne
you expect me to believe your false-
hoods

 he nodded to surp send him
back to llon to the custody of the
brain

  crain laughed savagely too late
for that the brain is dead-slain
by dandor

 from surp came an unhuman bel-
low of rage

 the brain dead my great ally
slain diabolical fury was in his face
as he whirled toward lanu let me
kill this mongrel for that highness
he cried gods to think that he and
that old fox dandor should have slain
the mightiest intellect on this world

  yes highness ligor urged tense-
ly while this choluan half-breed
lives there is no safety for you since
he may again escape and impersonate
you

  i cant have my own half-brother
killed like that lanu said with deep
reluctance no matter what his crimes
have been he must be kept in some
safe prison

  what prison will hold him when
the mighty brain could not ligor
pointed out

into surps hard face suddenly
came an expression of ferocious

jy

  i know where we can put him so
that he will be safe surp declared
among the electrae

  make him one of the electrae

the king cried that would be more
horrible than killing him

  it is the only place where we can
keep him safe highness surp urged
we can take him secretly to the tem-
ple and do it and no one will know of
his existence but ourselves and these
guards of mine whose silence ill
vouch for he cannot escape from the
electrae and when bara is revived
and the electrae all made real again
then you can decide his fate

  horror invaded philip crains mind
as he perceived surps diabolical in-
tention the noble well knew that
lanu would never return from earth
that the electrae would never be
freed he would leave crain with the
other electrae a drifting electric
ghost until the end of time

  no lanu mara cried terrified
you cant do such a thing

  lanu had seemed to be on the verge
of denying surps wish but the pro-
test of the princess stung the king

   you plead for him mara he cried
angrily then perhaps it is the pre-
tended lanu and not the real lanu
whom you love

  a flash of defiance lit up maras
blue-black eyes

  yes it is she declared unhesi-
tatingly

  the joy that rocked philip crains
mind at that passionate avowal was
crushed in the next moment by lanus
raging cry

  then your lover goes into the
electrae as surp wishes the king
exclaimed ill not leave him here
to sneak again upon my throne and
take my place with you

lanu hear me crain cried des-
perately if you go to earth youll
never come back surp plans-
silence him shouted lanu his
face flaming with jealousy and rage

  the words were stifled in crains
throat by the brawny hand of one of
the guards who gripped him

  well take him to the temple at
once in secret lanu declared his
-black eyes still flaming anger once
he is safely in the electrae we can
start to cholu leaving ligor here as
regent of bara as you suggested
good surp was exultant wrap
the prisoner of mars



him in a cloak men no one must see
his face

  a smothering cloak was wrapped
around crain and he was picked up
bodily he struggled but futilely to
break free he could hear mara still
pleading frantically with lanu as he
was carried from the room

  in a few moments crain felt the
chill of cold air heard the roar of the
storm and knew they were in the open
air from far to the left came the thin
voices of the soldiers in the plaza he
knew then that he was being taken by
a secret circuitous route to the tem-
ple

  crains mind had room now for
nothing but horror as he thought of
the ghastly state into which he was
to be hurled to become an electrae
a drifting electric phantom doomed
to haunt this world forever-it could-
nt happen to him surely not when
he had just found the one way out for
both his worlds

he heard a challenge of peremp-
tory voices as his bearers
stopped

  who comes no man can enter
the temple at night then the voice
exclaimed in altered tones the
king

  stand aside crain heard lanu tell
the guards raising his voice over the
howling winds we take to the altar
one of the chosen who escaped the last
day of passing

  crain felt himself carried forward
and the storm roar became muffled as
they entered the temple he felt him-
self taken down many steps then
his arms still held by guards the cloak
was whipped off him

  he stood upon the sunken stage of
the great temple and through the
dusky darkness he could see figures
standing nearby then from the
crystal disk of the altar sprang the
shaft of blinding purple force it cast
a quivering glow outward the light
fell on lanu standing by the red
metal standard where he had just
turned on the dematerializing purple
force

  surps eyes were gleaming in tri-
umph and ligor was regarding

crains desperate face with a smile

  lanu dont do this crain cried
hoarsely youre being duped de-
ceived

  again lanus face showed irresolu-
tion and a shudder shook the crim-
son-cloaked king

  if my father were alive to see me
cast his other son into the electrae-
he muttered shakenly

  surp saw his wavering and pressed
him your throne will not be safe
if you dont do it highness remem-
ber how easily he took your place be-
fore

  aye drawled ligor he played
your part so well that mara now pre-
fers him an exposed impostor to
you

  that reminder did its work lanus
face flushed and he gestured roughly
to the guards who held crain

  cast him into the altar

   wait crain cried and at that mo-
ment felt himself hurled by brawny
arms straight toward the purple shaft
of light wait-

  the words were stricken from his
lips as he hurtled into the purple
force

  crain felt a terrific wrenching
shock in every atom of his body an
awful roaring in his ears a blinding
blaze in his eyes then everything
went dark and silent out of that mo-
ment of mad turmoil he seemed
hurled into the stillness and black-
ness of death

  his consciousness seemed strangely
dimmed he was aware of his own
thoughts but all bodily sensation was
gone from him

  gone as his body was gone he
knew with dim certainty that he was
now an immaterial thing of photons
that he was one of the electrae

chapter xviii
living death

queerly philip crain-the im-
material electric thing that had
once been the man crain-floated in
a dim semi-consciousness that was


startling stories

without sight without sound without
even time he knew nothing nothing
but his own thoughts he was alone
with his thoughts for all eternity

  horror horror horror it was the
only thought his bodiless mind could
contain the only sensation of which
he was now capable horror at the
ghastly fate into which he had been
thrustthe awful doom that was to be
his for all time to come

  how long had he been in this bodi-
less immaterial state how long had
he been an electrae he could not
guess it might have been hours or
it might have been days or weeks
time had ceased to have meaning
when there were no events to mark its
passage nothing changed in the
dark eternity that encompassed him
-nothing except his racing ghastly
thoughts

  he still had memory he could still
remember that awful moment of shock
when he had been cast into the altar
shaft at lanus order he could still
reember the sight of lanus weak face
horror-stricken by his own deed and
the triumphant face of surp the
taunting eyes of ligor

  rage succeeded the horror crain felt
-blind rage he could not express
rage against surp and ligor for their
diabolical plan against lanu for lis-
tening to them and then the horror
came back upon him in great waves
as he realized that he could never now
take revenge upon them that he a
bodiless mind lost in lonely eternities
was cut off forever from everything
real

 he would never again see mara
standing with dark eyes bright and
brave as she had stood when she had
proudly declared her love for him he
would never again watch the hurtling
moons rise over bara never again look
upon the rosy dawn-flushed towers of
ingomar he was near all these things
yet he was now but one of the blind
drifting firefly things that he had once
looked upon with such pity

 darkness and darkness - and he
floated on through its infinities alone
with his torturing thoughts that
sensation of floating was the only sen-
sation of which his new photon body

was capable he knew that he was
drifting at random borne upon elec-
tric and magnetic currents like a rud-
derless ship

  what could he do without a body
without ability to see or hear or feel
he was no more than a ghost haunting
the real world a pitiful ghost who
could not even look upon the living
a drifting firefly thing a wandering
glow to be looked on and forgotten

  into crains mind at some time in
this dark timelessness of his new ex-
istence had come thought that he
might be flung to earth and remate-
rialized if he happened to drift into
the great matter-caster when it was
turned on but even that faint possi-
bility died when he remembered what
dandor had said that the de-material-
izing and re-materializing forces of
the altar were of a secret different na-
ture than those of the matter-casters
though working on the same principle
only the altar could make a man into
an electrae and only the altar could
ever reverse the ghastly process

  crain did not know how much time
had passed in his new existence before
there subtly impinged upon his mind
a foreign thought

 who are you are you new

hence did it come out of the
all-enveloping darkness that
questioning thought that his mind was
receiving

  are you new

  crain tried to reply but how could
he without body or voice he essayed
to think an answer

  yes i am new who are you

 and the impinging answer came
more strongly

  i am an electrae like yourself
come closer newcomer

  i cannot come closer-i dont know
where you are-i dont know how to
move crain thought frantically

  silence had he lost contact with
the other electrae the thought of
being left again without even that
ghostly thought-voice was terrible

  i am beside you now clearly
came the thought of the other elec-
trae what is your name newcomer
i was skuro a soldier when i lived
the prisoner of mars



 my name was krayn when i
lived crain thought stumblingly
tell me how is it that we can com-
municate when we have no voices
skuro answered it is because our
photon bodies are able to project tiny
electrical vibrations that impinge
upon each others photons

  you can move at will crain
asked

  not at will the other electrae
thought back our photon bodies
drift on magnetic currents and yet
by thought emanations our one power
we can breast the currents a little
how long have you been an elec-
trae crain asked

  what was the date when you were
cast out of life skuro asked in turn

  crain told him and the thought-
voice of skuro answered sadly then
i have been among the electrae for
nearly thirty years

  thirty years crains bodiless
mind rocked with horror

  there is no difference between
thirty years and thirty centuries to an
electrae skuro told him the elec-
traes thought was tinged with wist-
fulness when he continued i had a
wife and children who entered the
electrae with me when i was chosen
in the drawing long since i became
separated from them though some-
times i drift into them and exchange
thoughts with them for a little while
crain tried to imagine what thirty
years of existence as an electrae
would be like or a thousand years or
an eternity he could not vision it
his mind could not compass such a
dreadful vista drifting through dark-
ness and silence wrapped around with
the stillness and emptiness of the in-
finite

  is there no way in which an elec-
trae can die he thought agonizedly
to skuro

  it was not skuros thought but that
of another nearby electrae that
answered

  no newcomer we cannot die we
cannot even go mad

  and the thought of still another
floating near crain came to him ques-
tioningly newcomer tell us is there
any hope on bara now for the success

of the great plan

  it seemed to crain that a number of
the electrae must have gathered
around him for he received other ea-
gerly inquiring thoughts

 even now crains thought an-
swered baran forces must be upon
cholu ready to hurl the water of that
world to bara

incredulous joyful emana-
tions reached him from all sides
a tumult of rejoicing thoughts

  then it will not be long before we
electrae are released we shall be
men again

  no crain told them bitterly
bara may be revived but we of the
electrae shall never be released

  and he told them through thought
waves of surps plans to seize royal
power and let the electrae remain
forever in their present state

  rage awful and burning beat upon
crains bodiless mind in every
thought that came to him from the
darkness the fury of the electrae
was terrible as they learned that their
one hope was snatched from them

  and higher mounted their rage as
they learned that surp had been tam-
pering with the drawing of the lots
so that only those he hated only those
who refused to support his ambitions
had been chosen to become electrae

 gods came skuros raging
thought if i had known that id
have slain surp before ever i allowed
myself to be cast into this awful im-
mortality

  if i could be a man for but one
hour again came the furious thought
of another i would use that hour to
kill surp slowly to betray the hopes
of us who have waited such eternities
for release

  crain felt the same wild surging
desire to get his hands on surps
throat a desire that drove him to cry
out a desperate mental question

  is there no way in which we can
become real again

  no way newcomer somberly
thought a nearby electrae only the
forces of the altar in the temple can
make us men again

  a faint shadow of hope entered
	startling stories

crains mind if it were possible to
communicate with mara-

  his idea was perceived and under-
stood by the electrae in the nothing-
ness about him and skuro answered
him

  no krayn we electrae cannot
communicate with men or women for
the thought-messages we project are
electrical and the neuro-chemical
brains of human beings cannot receive
them

  crains dim hope faded and the
black tide of horror rolled back across
his soul

  he fought against it he philip
crain must not remain an immaterial
blind dumb thing of photons the
future of both earth and mars de-
pended on him he must win back to
life somehow he would win back

  and in the wake of that wildly des-
perate resolve came rising inspiration

  tell me skuro he thought ex-
citedly could a being whose brain
and nervous system and life are elec-
trical in nature receive our thought-
messages

  skuros answering thought was
doubtful i think so if our thought
was strong enough but where is
there any such being as that

  hope had flamed up anew in crains
unbodied mind hope that even the
awful infinity of dark silence about
him could not extinguish

  listen to me electrae he cast his
thought excitedly outward gather
near me and listen would you like
to become real living men again-
now

the answer came back from far
and near from scores of electrae
yes but what can we do who are
but phantoms blown upon winds of
darkness

  if i am able to make you men
again and keep you men crains
thought beat forth will you promise
to obey me in all things to follow
wherever i lead

  what mean these questions came
a somberly hopeless thought you
can do nothing newcomer

  i say that i can make you men
again now and keep you men if my

plan succeeds crain cried mentally
will you agree to follow me if i

do

  i agree answer skuro promptly
i do not believe you can do anything
but the chance is worth trying

  and i agree to follow you too   
and t came a chorus of scores of
eager but doubtful thoughts

  then gather close all of you
crain told them and think as i think
-project the message which i pro-
ject with all your mental force
crain concentrated his mind upon
one thought one being one message
that must get through

  kro he sent his mental call out
into the darkness kro can you hear
me it is your master

  and in unison with him the hun-
dreds of the electrae whom he could
sense around him sent that same
excited message streaming forth
kro your master is calling you
silence then silence of thought
as well as the unbroken silence of
sound stillness and darkness in
which crains photon body floated

  he waited his mind unutterably
tense would kro hear kros brain
and life were electrical in nature-he
knew that from what dandor had said
could the robot receive the electrical
vibration of thought from the
gathered electrae

  again crain throbbed fiercely
call again with all your force
once more the thought-cry of the
gathered electrae pulsed into the
darkness

  kro your master calls

  and then out of the darkness there
came to crains bodiless mind a thin
far-off thought the vibration of an
electrical mind remote and dim as
from another star

  master i hear you in my mind
came that far-off mental cry master
where are you

chapter xix
the fight in the temple

excitement and a joyous thriii
shot through philip crains elec-
trical being as the robots answer
the prisoner of mars



came his desperate hope had been
justified kros electrical brain and
being were able to receive the elec-
trical thought-waves of the electrae

  crain called back mentally to the
robot and all the hundreds of elec-
trae gathered around him helped pro-
ject that thought in unison

  kro where are you he called
in the gardens master where you
left me came the robots answer i
have been waiting here four days
four days crain felt a shock of
surprise at learning that so much
time had passed since he had been
cast among the electrae

  yes master kro was replying
i have waited here just as you last
ordered me no one has seen me but
i saw many thousands of men and
worms with other equipment being
shot from the great matter-caster in
the plaza surp and lanu and their
followers went first and thousands of
others after them

  crain felt an agony of apprehen-
sion he was too late then to stop
the attack upon earth by now surp
and lanu with their forces were prob-
ably already driving across earth to-
ward the sea to set up their myriad
matter-casters that invasion must
be taking place even now while he
floated as a phantom thing of light

  desperate determination replaced
crains despair it might not be too
late for him to act that plan of his
that would mean life for both earth
and mars-he still might be able to
put it into effect if he could win back
from his present immaterial state

  it is night now master kro was
calling what shall i do

  stay there kro crain projected
keep your mind calling and i shall
try to come to you

  and crain cried mentally to the
electrae we must go to the robot
comrades you said it was possible
to move a little at will skuro

  yes krayn came skuros excited
thought by projecting electrical
mental emanations and using their
slight reaction to propel our photon
bodies we can move slowly in any di-
rection if the magnetic currents are
not too strong

  all together then-toward the
robot crain told them

  he felt the darkness around him
alive with faint waves of electrical
force as the electrae sought to drive
hemselves toward the robot whose
mental call came steadily through the
darkness

  crain felt himself floating slowly
in that black lightlessness and silence
he had no idea of directions but after
a time the robots mental call came
much stronger and clearer

  you are beside me now master
kro reported mentally hundreds of
electrae swarming all around me in
the gardens

  good crains thought beat forth
now you must go to the window of
the princess maras apartment in the
east wing of the palace kro be care-
ful that none sees you

then came skuros puzzled men-
tal question

  what are you planning krayn
only the altars rematerializing
force can make us men again crains
thought answered swiftly mara can
turn that force on-if she will
why not have the robot himself
turn on the force another of the
electrae asked excitedly

  he could not enter the temple the
guards would destroy him on sight
but mara who is of the royal blood
can enter

  sharply clear came kros mental
voice

  i am at the window of the princess
apartment master ligor is with her

  ligor crain thought the bitter
hate he felt for surps son flaming up
in his disembodied mind

  yes master kro told him ligor
is telling the princess that since he is
now regent of bara she had better
surrender to his love mara answers
angrily that he presumes upon his po-
sition and that when lanu returns
she will have him punished

  ligor laughs at this master he
says that lanu will never return but
will die on cholu and that surp will
return as king he says also that if
she is still thinking of the impostor
krayn who is now among the electrae


startling stories

she might as well forget him since
surp does not mean ever to release the
electrae mara orders ligor out of her
apartment and he goes laughing left
alone mara sinks into a chair and
weeps

  at this relation of kros deep emo-
tion shook crains mind mara weep-
ing-for him

  enter the apartment now kro
crain ordered tensely tell the
princess that you bring a message
from me

  interminable waiting then again
kros mental call came loud

  i am in the apartment master
the princess was frightened of me at
first but she knows now that you are
speaking to her through me she is
looking out at the hovering swarm of
electrae outside her window

  crain could almost see that scene-
mara leaning forth gazing at the fire-
fly swarm one of whose shining phan-
toms was crain himself

  tell her he called tensely that
she must go to the temple and turn on
the rematerializing force in the altar
-that that is the only way i can re-
turn to life

  kros answer came soon i have
told her master and she is troubled
she says krayn i love you and
would give my life to bring you into
life again but i fear that you mean
to wreck the great plan that will re-
vive bara that you mean to work
against my world 

  tell her that bara as much as
cholu is my world crain exclaimed
mentally that i have a plan that
will benefit both worlds instead of
devastating one to save the other
again kros answer came quickly
she says i will do what you ask
krayn i go now to the temple to turn
on the altar

  emanations of tense excitement
throbbed from the electrae around
crain desperate eagerness of sha-
dowy phantoms who sensed a chance
to live again

  the princess and i are hurrying
around the dark plaza master kro
reported no one has seen us yet
we must follow crain cried
mentally to the hordes of electrae

and desperately he projected his
electrical mental waves to propel
him after the robot and mara the
emanations of the electrae told him
that they too were moving with him
and the thoughts of kro came louder
again proving that they were follow-
ing the princess and the robot closely

  we are at the entrance of the tem-
ple master came the robots thought
the guards have halted us mara
orders them to stand aside but their
officer has seen the swarms of elec-
trae who follow us and he hesitates
he says it is unprecedented for any-
one to enter the temple at this hour
of night and that he should consult
the regent ligor

  mara threatens the officer kro
continued swiftly she reminds him
she is of the blood royal and haugh-
tily she dismisses him and his guards
the officer gives way to her com-
mands and marches away with his
men

  now we enter the temple master
there are countless hundreds of
electrae swarming around us the
princess has gone to the metal stand-
ard beside the altar she quickly sets
the little wheels that control it sud-
denly a great shaft of bright red force
shoots up from the altar-

  and crains bodiless mind at that
moment felt that sudden rush of force
from the altar the rematerializing
vibrations he felt them drawing him
toward them like a powerful magnet

  he sensed himself floating toward
the source of that surging force like
a chip drawn into a whirlpool then
came a terrific clashing shock of force
through the photons of his electric
being he felt wrenching rasping
agony-and could have cried aloud
with joy that he could feel that pain
a tremendous force seemed to strain
his being then there was a bumping
fall upon a hard surface a roaring in
his ears a blaze of bright red light in
his eyes-

  he was real again crain was stand-
ing solid and material beside the
blazing shaft of red force that sprang
from the altar in the vast dark temple

  a man again he choked thank
god im out of the electrae
the prisoner of mars



  mara came running toward him her
face deathly white tears in her dark
eyes

  krayn she cried then she was
sobbing in his arms

  he held her close for a moment still
shaken by the shock of rematerializa-
tion

  around the blazing red shaft count-
less hundreds of glowing electrae
were swirling wildly one by one
they were floating into the red force

  and out of the red force appearing
first as misty phantoms and then as
real solid people came men first to
appear after crain was a huge brawny
soldier in helmet and metal tunic his
battered face transfigured with joy

  real again he cried jubilantly
i skuro a living man once more
after thirty years in that hell

  skuro remember the promise you
all made crain cried that you
would follow me and obey my orders
after you were rematerialized

  skuro wrenched loose a metal post
from a nearby railing and swung it
like a great mace his eyes flaring

  lead me anywhere he roared
ill follow to hell itself

other men by dozens by scores
were appearing in the crimson
shaft of force staggering out of it
gazing wildly around there were
women too from the electrae all
took up skuros cry

  kro had come clanking forward
and the robot stood silent with lens-
eyes calmly fixed upon crain

  kro without you wed never have
won free crain exclaimed with
heartfelt gratitude

  what now krayn mara was ask-
ing tensely ligor still rules bara
as regent

  well rematerialize enough of the
electrae to overcome him crain ex-
claimed his dark lean face eager
then well flash to earth-

  master i hear men coming kro
rasped suddenly

  the doors of the shadowy temple
burst open armed guards burst in
with ligor at their head his hand-
some face went white with rage as he
saw crain with mara

   see it is as i feared the officer
beside him cried the princess is
releasing some of the electrae

  raging ligor drew the gas-gun at
his belt but before he could level it
the giant skuro flung the metal mace
in his hand it struck ligors temple
and the young regent went down
stunned

   forward men crain yelled to the
electrae-men who had already rema-
terialized from the brilliant shaft of
force

  with a hoarse crazed shout the
electrae-men leaped forward upon
the astounded guards

   gas-guns flashed out in the guards
hands and chuffed with deadly quick-
ness little clouds of green vapor
flicked through crains charging men
burning through them as though they
were men of paper

  but unstopped by that crains un-
leashed unarmed force charged on
they reached the guards before a sec-
ond volley could be fired and then it
was hand-to-hand with no room to use
the gas-guns a staggering conflict of
guards and electrae-men by the door
of the dusky temple

  crain struck like a madman con-
scious that he was fighting for both
bara and earth the sheer physical
joy of being real again after that hor-
rible interval as an electric phantom
made him laugh fiercely as his fists
smashed home on terrified martian
faces

   beside crain towered the great ro-
bot and kros metal fists were dealing
death and the electrae-men released
from years of shadowy nothingness
were insane in the fury of their attack

  the guards could not stand against
that terrific assault the remainder
of them turned and fled from the
temple

  crain turned panting more and
more of the electrae-men had
emerged from the rematerializing
force during the fight hundreds of
them were now in the temple beside
the frantically rejoicing women who
had come through with them

  we have enough men now to hold
the city crain exclaimed turn
off the altar force mara


startling stories

as the princess obeyed as the
crimson shaft died skuro cried
to crain but what of our friends
our families still in the electrae
are they not to be released too
they shall all be released every
one when my plans for bara are
achieved crain grimly assured
there would not be enough food for
them all on bara now but if you
follow me and help me win my goal
bara will be able to support them all
and all will be freed

  you hear comrades roared
skuros bull voice we fight now for
the release of the other electrae

  a tremendous shout went up from
the hundreds of electrae-men

  we follow wherever you lead
krayn

  kro had grasped ligor who was
rising dazedly from the floor

  shall i kill him master the robot
asked

  yes death for surps son fiercely
shouted the electrae-men

  no do not kill him crain or-
dered but see that he does not es-
cape

  maras slender figure came flying
through the milling throug to crains
side

  krayn what do you plan she
asked eagerly

  we must go to earth-to cholu
crain said swiftly we must save
lanu from being killed by surp if it
is not too late and we must over-
throw surp once and for all

  and then mara asked anxiously
you will hurl the water of cholu to
bara then

  crain shook his head firmly no
mara i will not take one drop of
earths seas for this world but i
will make bara green and fertile
again by other means will you
trust my promise to do that

  maras dark eyes were filmed with
doubt

  i do not see how you can revive
bara without taking cholus water
she said but i trust you krayn
now to the matter-caster in the
plaza crain called to his eager
electrae-men

  they emerged with a shout from

the temple dawn was breaking over
ingomar the sky paling and flushing
pink washing the rosy towers with
deepened color

  the guards who had been posted
around the colossal matter-caster in
the plaza had fled tempestuous
excitement was stirring through the
city but crain paid it no heed

chapter xx
two brothers

grimly crain ordered some
hundreds of his men partly
armed now with gas-guns of the fallen
guards onto the matter-casters tre-
mendous crystal disk then with the
remaining electrae-men mara ac-
companying him and kro following
with the captured ligor crain led the
way toward the massive switch-board
aid voice-cone that towered in the
plaza near the disk

  you are to remain on guard at this
switchboard crain told his detach-
ment of electrae-men swiftly he ex-
plained to them its operation we
others go now to earth

  you have forgotten one thing
choluan ligor sneered my
fathers men will be in charge of the
matter-caster on cholu do you think
they will turn it on at your request
thats why you are with us ligor
crain said tightly you are going to
call the baran base on earth and ask
that the matter-caster be turned on to
receive us

  ligor laughed scornfully i sup-
pose that you mean to kill me if i re-
fuse then kill me half-breed for

i	will never do it

  no we wont kill you crain said
and his voice and eyes were deadly
well just turn you into an electra
if you refuse

  aye fiercely shouted the elec-
trae-men make of surps son what
his fathers trickery made of us
ligor was not a coward but he
blanched at the threat of that doom
that a baran feared above all else he
had a trapped look
the prisoner of mars

s

  well snapped crain

   ill-do it surps son said thickly
turn on the voice-cone

  the great transformers hummed
with power and ligor called up into
the cone

  ligor calling i am coming
through to cholu have your ma-
chine ready to receive me

  minutes later the astonished an-
swer came back but you were to
stay on bara as regent sir-

  im coming through ligor hec-
tored do as i order

  when the reply finally came it was
obsequious matter-caster now on to
receive sir

  crain jumped back up onto the huge
crystal disk where skuro and his host
of impatient electrae-men waited at
crains command kro followed grip-
ping ligors arm

  im going with you mara de-
clared

  you mustnt mara crain ex-
claimed therell be fighting on
earth-you wont be safe

  does a princess of bara think only
of safety she demanded dark eyes
flashing i go

  crain raised his hand in signal to
the electrae-men stationed at the
switchboard he saw them fling the
switches over as he had instructed
them

  the transformers droned deafen-
ingly the great disk under them
shimmered with glowing blue light
as the first switches were thrown
mara pressed close to crain trembling
a little but her dark head was held
steadily erect

  the last switch clashed shut- and
a terrific upburst of force hurled crain
and his companions on the disk into
nothingness he experienced as be-
fore only the sensation of racing
rocketing speeding back through the
black gulf of space toward earth   

the crashing shock of conscious-
ness smote philip crain he
opened his eyes to a blaze of hot after-
noon sunlight the sunlight of
earth

  he and his companions his host of
electrae-men stood upon the vast

crystal disk of a matter-caster identi-
cal with that which had hurled them
across the void nearby at the switch-
board of the great machine a company
of baran soldiers gaped at this angry-
eyed throng that had suddenly ap-
peared where they had expected only
ligor

  in that first moment of stricken
silence crains swift glance showed
him that the canadian forests had
been destroyed for an area of a mile
around upon this raw new plain
rose great piles of martian equipment
and newly-erected metal huts and
barracks

  gods of bara who are these the
officer at the switchboard was shout-
ing

  theyre enemies of surp ligor
yelled frenziedly squirming from
kros grip they made me call you
attack them

  the officer uttered a loud cry

  guards he called toward the bar-
racks

  but already philip crain was shout-
ing orders to his own men the elec-
trae-men had sprung off the disk and
were rushing to meet the baran
soldiers running from the barracks

  a crazy battle spread like flame
around the huge matter-caster gas-
guns chuffed deadly vapor clouds
swirled through the melee hoarse
voices shouted

  crain had used his gas-gun to blow
deadly clouds through the oncoming
soldiers from the barracks until the
weapon was exhausted he sprang
into the fight using the silvery tube
as a bar striking right and left
enemy could hardly be told from
friend in that mad conflict

  martians at death-grips here in the
sunlight of earth and all of them
crain noticed even in the wild whirl
of the fight moved heavily with
difficulty weighed down by the
greater gravitation of the larger
planet and breathing noisily in its
thicker atmosphere

  fight the giant skuro was shout-
ing in a bull roar to his companions
remember we fight for the freedom
of the electrae

  for the electrae went up the

startling stories

fierce battle-cry of the men who them-
selves had been electric phantoms
only a few hours before

  the martian base had been guarded
by only a thousand men and though
this was a greater number than crains
force what the electrae-men lacked
in numbers they made up in sheer
ferocity

  the soldiers crumpled under the
tigerish attack of the electrae-men
and in the forefront of the attack
striding like a metal colossus smash-
ing right and left kro the robot was
killing

  the soldiers began to throw up their
hands in surrender a few surviving
officers had already fled to a half-
dozen worms parked nearby and
were racing away southward except
for a few scattered combats the fight
was over

  anxiously crain ran back to where
mara stood near the matter-caster

oure all right he asked
anxiously

  her face was pale and drawn yes
-but i feel heavy hardly able to
stand she gasped

  its the greater gravitation-youll
soon become used to it he assured
her

  crain whirled around as from near-
by came a sharp excited cry

  philip philip crain

  from one of the metal huts several
men were running he recognized
john martins massive face and the
red head of scott fulton then he
saw kay

  and behind them stumbled another
man in soldiers metal under a crim-
son cloak lanu crain felt a strange
throb of gladness that he had been in
time to save his half-brother

  john martins face was ghastly as
he reached crain his eyes feverish as
be poured out information

  theres a terrible invasion of
earth going on philip the main
martian forces under that noble
surp are driving headlong toward the
sea thousands of them hundreds of
those worms are pushing down
through new york state now weve
got the radio reports-

  kay was crying her face was no
longer the stiff hypnotized mask it
had been when crain last saw it

  and i did it philip she sobbed
i called father to open the matter-
caster here and the advance guard of
the martians came through with me
but i didnt know what i was doing
of course she didnt exclaimed
scott fulton his arm around the sob-
bing girl her mind was a blank
when she came through with those
martians but a few days ago she be-
came normal

  crain suddenly understood when
the brain had been killed far out
there on mars its remorseless hypno-
tic grip upon kay had been abruptly
relaxed

  lanu came stumbling up moving
heavily his face white as death

  krayn my brother he cried
you were right about surp he is a
traitor once our expedition reached
this world surp had his men secretly
seize me and prison me in that hut
with these choluans one of your
men just released us surp gave out
that i was ill that i had deputed com-
mand of the host to him but he left
orders that i was to be killed when
the main baran host was far enough
away that it would not hear about it
what are you going to do philip
john martin demanded that mar-
tian drive toward the sea must be
stopped and all earths forces cant
stop it the weapons of earths de-
fenders are useless the radio said
ive got a plan crain told them
swiftly ive got to get to the main
baran army confront surp and-
krayn look out mara screamed
crain whirled ligor forgotten
during the wild conflict stood not ten
yards away he held a gas-gun in his
hand levelled at crain kro was rac-
ing toward ligor but was still yards
from him

  at least ill send you out of life
impostor ligor snarled and pulled
the trigger

  the little cloud of deadly vapor
shot toward crain but lanu was
plunging headlong thrusting crain
out of the path of the deadly disinte-
grating gas
the prisoner of mars



the cloud touched lanus side
the baran king fell heavily
crain heard mara scream as he re-
gained his balance he saw kro
reach ligor at that same moment saw
the robots metal fist crash down upon
ligors skull-and shatter it

  crain sprang to lanu there was
a great gaping opening in the kings
side his crimson cloak and metal
tunic and the tissues of his body were
eaten away there where the deadly
vapor had touched him

  lanu crain cried hoarsely

  lanus face-that face so weirdly
identical with crains own-was
waxy but his large dark eyes stared
up into his half-brothers face

  i could not let that upstart kill
you brother lanu whispered i
owed you that for having disbelieved
you and sent you into the electrae
crains voice was choking lanu
you mustnt die were going to
overthrow surp and i have a plan
that will revive bara without harm-
ing cholu youll sit upon the throne
of a new green populous bara

  no lanu whispered weakly i
feel the life running out of me his
fingers fumbled feebly at the collar of
his cloak you must wear the royal
crimson now krayn for i bequeath
the kingship to you and i bequeath
to you my vengeance on surp

  the dying mans eyes seemed to
stare around in an effort to discover
another face

  mara he murmured

  the princess knelt beside him her
eyes tear-bright

  yes lanu yes

  his eyes clung to her face strangely
wistful mara -  he murmured
again then his body twitched his
face froze

  dead said john martin

  mara was weeping crain rose to
his feet his mind a whirl of emotions
he helped the others pick up lanus
limp body and carry it toward the
metal hut that had been their prison

  as they laid lanus body down a
little radio set in the hut-one that
cram recognized as part of their ori-
ginal camping equipment-was vibrat-
ing to an announcers hoarse voice

  newark giving further bulletins
on the invasion the main force of the
mysterious invaders is now heading
south they have just left albany
and are heading down the hudson
river valley toward new york all
resistance to them has proved futile
for within a hundred mile radius of
them no powder will explode no
gasoline motor will operate no air-
plane or tank or automobile or firearm
can be used

  there has been no great loss of life
so far since at albany as at kingston
and syracuse and utica the popula-
tion has fled out of the path of the in-
vaders advance but we beg all in
the country to believe us when we
say that this invasion is real it is
not another hoax as most of the
country seems to believe we im-
plore the population of the hudson
river valley and of new york to be-
lieve and to flee at once

  you hear john martin cried
most of the country still doesnt
believe in the invasion thinks it an-
other radio hoax and when that at-
tack reaches new york city-all those
millions-

  surp and his host must not reach
new york crain exclaimed
theyre driving for the sea to set up
the matter-casters that will hurl water
to bara but i can stop them if i can
reach them in time

he stooped took the royal crim-
son cloak from lanus dead
form and flung it around his own
shoulders then he leaped toward
the door of the metal hut

  im going after them in a worm
theres no time to lose come on
kro

  the great robot sprang to obey
but mara stumbled out into the sun-
light after them

  i go too krayn she cried

  he started to deny her then saw by

you will be of help when i face
surps army

  the robot clanked rapidly toward
one of the remaining worms there


startling stories

 were only two-the others had been
 used by the escaping officers of surp
 for flight

    skuro crain called to the giant
  electrae-man you and ten of your
  men go with me in the worm the
  rest of you remain here and guard the
  matter-casters and these choluans

   mara climbed into the worm with
 crain skuro and ten of his electrae-
 men followed they hastily took
 their places at the breeches of the big
 gas-guns with which their war-vehicle
 was equipped

    start kro philip crain ordered
  the robot follow the trail of surps
  army

   the worm shot forward it slid
 like a racing metal snake across the
 raw plain that had been gouged from
 the forest

    from this devastated area a broad
  swathe led southeastward through the
  towering quebec forest a highway
  hundreds of feet wide that had been
  slashed from the woods by the passing
  of surps host trees and brush had
  been cleared by gas-guns and the
  earth had been tramped down by hun-
  dreds of passing worms-a trail that
  no one could miss

   upon this wide raw highway the
 single worm rushed through the
  warm late afternoon sunlight racing
 at full speed to overtake surp and his
 host hundreds of miles ahead speed-
 ing on through the sunset and the
 dusk with a great robot at its con-
 trols and a half score of newly-
 materialized electrae for crew bear-

chapter xxi



the ambush

 unlighted structures stood out
 in the brilliant midnight moon-
 light a mass of black

   thats utica philip crain de-
 clared tautly peering through the
 window in the nose of the worm
 surps army is still far ahead of us
 we must go faster kro

  we can go no faster master re-
plied the robot in his imperturbable
metallic voice

  maras hand closed on crains taut
fingers we shall overtake them by
morning krayn surely

  by morning surps army will be
crashing into new york he said raw-
ly that mustnt happen

  crains mind was feverish with min-
gled apprehension and hope all dur-
ing the night as the worm had raced
at top speed down through the can-
adian countryside and into new york
state his fears had tormented him

  for they had had evidence of how
the martian drive was crashing
through all resistance every city and
village they had passed through had
been dark and deserted from the
canadian hills from kingston where
they had crossed the st lawrence
from all the small cities and country-
side of upper new york the popula-
tion had fled east and west from the
martians

  crain had learned from a radio
loudspeaker still shouting in deserted
kingston that surps army was driv-
ing straight down the hudson river
valley from albany the newspapers
and radio stations were still trying to
convince the country that this incred-
ible invasion was real and not another
radio scare and the war depart-
ment was still frantically trying to
find a way to overcome the mysterious
influence that made all earthly weap-
ons useless within a hundred miles of
the invaders army

  its the weapon that the brain de-
vised for surp the thing called an
anti-catalyzer thats causing that
crain had exclaimed i understand
now the thing emits a field of force
that inhibits and slows down all chem-
ical activity within a hundred miles
thats why explosives in its field only
burn slowly instead of exploding and
its why gasoline motors wont work
but why doesnt the inhibiting
field prevent the gas-guns of the
barans from working mara had
wondered

  the gas-guns utilize a physical
not a chemical principle crain had
reminded her the vapor from them
the prisoner of mars



doesnt combine chemically with sub-
stances but simply dissolves them

  now as the lightless structures of
utica loomed ahead crain was feeling
a rising hopelessness

  if they get to new york city he-
muttered all the millions there still
believing the invasion a hoax-

  kro was driving the worm through
the outskirts of darkened utica into
the business section weirdly dark
and deserted in the moonlight lay the
once bustling city a few sections of
it had been destroyed by the gas-guns
of surps host

  kro look out crain yelled sud-
denly

  two worms had darted suddenly
from a dark side street their gas-guns
jetting vapor at crains vehicle

  the robots super-sensitive mind
had perceived the peril before crain
had kro whirled their worm aside
like lightning in time to avoid the
deadly little clouds of vapor

  its an ambush crain cried surp
set this trap for us he must know
were trying to overtake him

ith yells skuro and the other
electrae-men reached for the
breeches of their big gas-guns

  we must fight it out crain
shouted theyll destroy us easily if
we try to get away

  then began a weird unearthly bat-
tle in that moonlit deserted utica
street battle of one martian machine
against the two others that sought to
destroy it

 again the attacking worms
launched gas charges at crains ma-
chine again it leaped clear of them
by grace of kros speed at the con-
trols the robot with his super-swift
sensory reactions was fighting a bat-
tle no man could have fought

  skuro and his men launched deadly
green clouds at their antagonists and
missed the vapors struck a nearby
office building whiffed away its first
floor upper floors crashed down with
a roar of falling masonry

like battling serpents the three
worms poised the one facing the two

in the moonlight the machines looked
like great struggling snakes

  they separate krayn mara cried
as the two enemy machines began to
glide apart

  they mean to catch us from both
sides crain said tautly

   be ready rasped the robots metal
voice aim your guns at the right-
hand worm

  and kro suddenly darted their ma-
chine at the left-hand enemy gas-
clouds puffed from it but kros strike
had only been a feint with incred-
ible swiftness the robot whirled the
worm around toward the other
enemy skuros men fired their guns

  the clouds of green vapor flew
through the moonlight and hit the
right-hand enemy squarely the
whole middle of that machine was in-
stantly gone whiffed away by the
gas

  thats one of them gone crain
cried

   krayn were hit mara screamed

  the remaining enemy as kro fin-
ished the unexpected maneuver had
fired again the whole tail of crains
worm was suddenly gone the drone
of its power plant began to die as vital
connections were severed

  got us crain cried hoarsely
kro-

  but the robot understanding the
situation was already acting before
their power had died completely be-
fore the remaining enemy could get in
another volley kro shot their crip-
pled worm toward the enemy ma-
chine

  they struck the enemy worm with
a crash of metal pinned it against a
building it struggled vainly to free
itself unable to use the big gas-guns
at these close quarters

   out and take them crain shouted

   drawing his belt gas-gun he leaped
out of their crippled machine fol-
lowed by kro and the yelling elec-
trae-men

  kros great metal hands tore open
the door of the pinned enemy worm
with a scream of rending hinges and
then they were pouring into the
enemy machine

   that wild hand-to-hand fight inside
the enemy worm was over in mo-
ments the barans were no match for


startling stories

crain and his blood-mad electrae-
men supported by the robot

  crain stood gasping wiping his
brow as the last enemy fell beneath
kros smashing metal fists

  well go on in this worm he
panted kro throw out those dead

mara came flying in to crains
side

  surp must have learned that we
follow him she cried how could
he learn

  the officers who escaped the fight
in the base camp master rasped kro
they fled southward after surp and
could have notified him that we are
now on cholu

  thats it crain exclaimed and
surp will have other ambushes wait-
ing to stop us and well hardly be
lucky enough to escape another such
trap

  black despair almost claimed crain
near exhaustion both physical and
nervous crushed beneath superhuman
responsibility he was almost ready
to admit defeat he forced himself
to fight down that feeling

  we dare not follow surps trail di-
rectly now or well be destroyed by
another ambush he declared we
must leave the path of his army swing
southward and then eastward and
approach the baran army from ahead
surp wont be expecting that

  but that means that we will be
passing through enemy country -
through these choluan people who
will believe us part of the invaders
mara objected theyll attack us

  well have to chance that crain
said its a better chance than run-
ning into another ambush come on 

  in a few moments their newly cap-
tured worm with kro at its controls
was racing through the deserted
streets of utica but now instead of
following the trail of the baran host
eastward toward albany they headed
south

  in the moonlight they rushed now
through an untouched countryside it
was as deserted as the area from which
they had come not until they were
east of binghamton a few hours be-
fore dawn did they come on people

in a small village excited crowds
were listening in the streets to the
radios announcements

  with shrieks of terror the villagers
fled as the great martian worm bore
down on them shots rattled off the
worm as it sped on through the ham-
let skuro and his men leaped to the
gas-guns to fire back but crains com-
mand halted them

  no we do not fire at earthmen
they are only defending themselves
they cannot know our mission and
they think us enemies

  but they may destroy us skuro
cried

  nevertheless we dont fire at
them crain ordered in an emer-
gency fire-but use the purple paraly-
sis beam doubtfully his followers
acceded to the order

  crain knew that from the village
word would be flashing ahead of a
martian worm raiding southward
he had kro keep their machine off
main roads circling around villages

  dawn was paling the eastern sky
as they swung down through the hills
toward scranton the citys streets
were deserted and a mob of cars and
people was fleeing southward

  theyve been warned of our com-
ing crain muttered to the left
kro we must swing eastward across
the river here toward new york

 the worm rushed through empty
streets toward a bridge across the
lackawanna river crains heart sank
suddenly for across the head of that
bridge steel girders had been piled in
a high heavy barricade that even the
worm could not crash through or
climb over behind it were khaki-clad
soldiers with mounted machine-guns
they were already spraying the
worm with bullets

  from an airplane above a shell
buret near them

  can we try another bridge mara
cried

  theyll all be barricaded crain
said hoarsely and weve got to get
across the river quickly

  there is but one thing to do then
skuro declared blast away the bar-
ricade and the men with our gas-
guns
the prisoner of mars



       chapter xxii
       the passing of kro

once more crain faced a fearful
dilemma he couldnt order
those soldiers men of earth who were
only doing their duty to be blasted
with their barricade out of the way
yet if he didnt the worm would
soon be destroyed by the field-gun
that was now getting the range its
shells were falling closer each mo-
ment

  as he stood irresolute in that mo-
ment of dire decision kro acted the
huge robot tore open the door of the
worm and plunged outside a sleep-
gas bomb in one hand

  i can clear that barricade master
the robots metallic voice cried

  kro wait crain cried but the
robot was already running toward the
bridge the paralysis ray shot out

  kros mighty metal body gleamed
bright in the sunrise as he headed for
the high barricade for a moment
the soldiers behind the pile of girders
stopped firing petrified at sight of the
metal monster charging toward them

  then they turned their rifles and
machine-guns on the robot bullets
rattled off kros massive metal torso
like hail shrapnel from bursting
shells showered him the bomb was
shot out of his hand

  and kro kept on going kept on
until he was at the pile of girders
the metal giant with his incredible
strength lifted a great girder from
the pile and threw it aside he threw
another aside-rapidly clearing away
the tangle of steel

  bullets from the soldiers behind the
barrier and the now falling planes
spanged off every part of his metal
body but working with mad strength
kro had already cleared away a part
of the barricade crain saw the robot
was staggering now seemingly badly
hit

  kro come back crain yelled
we can get through now

  guided by crains voice kro turned
and staggered back to the door of the

worm he pitched inside it fell to
the floor of the vehicle with a clank-
ing crash of metal

  the door was slammed shut crain
had already leaped to the controls
and he flung on the power the worm
shot toward the barricade bullets and
shrapnel hailed down on it crain
lifted the worms head in cobra fash-
ion and the vehicle slid like a snake
over the part of the barrier that kro
had partly cleared brushing past the
firing soldiers speeding on across the
bridge

  once the bridge was well behind
them crain sent the worm flying at
top speed down the road

  krayn kro is hurt mara cried

  crain abruptly stopped the worm
on the empty road and sprang back to
the robots side kro still lay upon
the floor with mara bending over him

  the robot was horribly mutilated
both its lens eyes had been smashed
out by bullets fragments of shrap-
nel had torn between the joints of its
metal body

  crain knew that the robots elec-
trical life was passing the complex
inner mechanism of kros brain and
nervous system had been damaged be-
yond repair

  kro he cried hoarsely he saw
the robots huge metal limbs stir
weakly heard a fading whisper

  yes-master-

  and with that dying whisper kros
strange life was gone he lay an inert
mass of metal

  hes dead mara said crying no
one but dandor could ever have re-
paired his mechanism

crain felt something hot and
stinging in his own eyes the
faithful metal servant trying to
answer him with his last dying
strength-

  i never thought crain said chok-
edly that anyone could shed tears
for a robot

  he stumbled back to the controls
and sent the worm flying forward
again over the open fields now

  look - above us cried skuro
pointing back and upward through
one of the little windows


startling stories

  crain glanced back and saw four
more airplanes overtaking them and
dipping toward them with a crescendo
roar

  bombers he cried

  but as he shouted the roar of the
airplane motors suddenly died yet
even with motors dead the army
bombers dipped desperately toward
them to loose their bombs

  huge missiles crashed down all
around the fleeing worm - great
bombs laden with the most deadly ex-
plosives known to earthly science
and the bombs did not explode
they simply burst open and the ex-
plosives inside them slowly burned

  were inside the radius of surps
anti-catalytic field now crain ex-
claimed thank god

  with motors dead the bombers
were drifting toward a landing crain
drove desperately on across the flat-
tening new jersey countryside

  as they entered the close-clustered
new jersey suburban cities they en-
countered roads and streets along
which streamed crowds of terror-
stricken refugees on foot on bicycles
or horses but not in automobiles cars
would not operate inside the field of
surps anti-catalyzer

  the refugee throngs scrambled
aside in wild panic as the worm
rushed through them rifles of march-
ing troops were aimed at them but
would not fire

  crain finally swung the worm up a
ramp onto the pulaski skyway it
too was jammed with outward-fleeing
refugees who shrank back terrifiedly
as the martian machine came on

  see krayn-surps armies come
mara cried pointing through a win-
dow

  far northward a little to the east
huge plumes of smoke and dust were
rising into the morning sunlight
plumes of destruction marking the
march of the baran armies southward
onto manhattan

  theyll be in new york in an
hour crain exclaimed

  the worm flew along the skyway
like a shooting python through
crowds of screaming refugees crash-
ing past stalled automobiles it

seemed an eternity before crain saw
the entrance of the holland tunnel
ahead

  the tunnel was disgorging a con-
stant stream of refugees on foot but
no cars were emerging and hardly
any were in the tube since the anti-
catalytic field has stalled all cars in
the metropolis before the populace
had finally credited the reality of the
incredible invasion and had started
to flee

  crain drove their worm straight
through the white-tiled tube scream-
ing men and women who expected to
be annihilated as the worm rushed
upon them flattened themselves on
either side

  crains eyes were flaming when fin-
ally he drove the worm out onto
eighth avenue

ew york was a maelstrom of
insane panic men and women
and children were fleeing toward the
bridges and the tubes radios were
bellowing warning like the trumpets
of doom

  leave the city leave the city
the invaders are here

  staring in wonder at the great me-
tropolis and its panic-mad throngs
mara pointed northward

  surps armies come

  crain saw clouds of green vapor
flashing in the north and smoke and
dust rising ominously

  he drove the worm recklessly
toward that pall of smoke and destruc-
tion that hung north of manhattan
by the time they reached morning-
side heights they met no more refu-
gees but now they met troops -
thousands of khaki-clad regulars and
militia retreating in disorder club-
bing their useless rifles

  earths defenders retreating before
this oncoming enemy against whom
their weapons were futile the worm
brushed through the troops north-
ward along upper broadway toward
the broad expanse of van cortlandt
park

  the hosts of bara cried the
princess mara

  in a great line across the city the
martian forces were advancing hun-
the prisoner of mars



dreds of huge worms gliding stead-
ily forward using their gas-guns to
blow away all the barricades and at-
tempted resistances and among them
moved two worms that had slung be-
tween them the huge hemispherical
anticatalyzer

  philip crain drove the worm right
into the park into the front of the
martian advance and as he stopped
the hundreds of worms all across the
line of battle stopped also as though
amazed at sight of a comrade coming
from ahead

  they converged upon crains mo-
tionless machine their gas-guns
turned ominously toward it-

  surp has ordered them to destroy
us mara cried he knows it is
you krayn

  but crain had already torn open
the door of the worm he was leap-
ing out onto the grass mara followed
him

  as crain ran toward the martian
worms his royal crimson cloak
flashed brilliantly in the sun and out
from the halted worms poured ex-
cited barans

  king lanu they cried amazedly

chapter xxiii
crains plan

just as if sudden orders had been
given them the advance of the
martian host had stopped completely
baran officers and men were pouring
forth from the worms gazing
amazedly at crain and mara

 and among them was surp the
massive nobles hard face went livid
with rage as he saw crain hate and
fear flared in surps eyes

  this is not king lanu he cried
to the astonished barans this is
only a half-breed brother of the king

  philip crain raised his voice

it is true barans that i am not
lanu but his brother lanu himself
is dead

  dead shouted hundreds of bar-
ans

 yes dead crain exclaimed

surp left lanu in the base camp in
the north not ill as you supposed but
a prisoner and surp left orders for
lanu to be killed-for surp himself
aspires to the throne his own son
ligor killed the king

  cries of fury went up at crains
charge quickly surp raised his
voice in a harsh shout of denial

  it is not true the noble bellowed
if the king is dead this mongrel
brother of his killed him this half-
breed half choluan and half baran is
the one who has sought to take lanus
throne not i

it is true cried princess maras
silver voice i saw ligor kill lanu
-before ligor himself was killed
my son dead cried surp for a
moment his face was ghastly

  lanu bequeathed the kingship to
his brother krayn who stands beside
me mara was crying to the baran
host nobles and soldiers of bara
he is your rightful king

  surp stiffened and he swung to
shout to the bewildered army

  will you believe the princess
lie he roared she is in love with
this mongrel and she probably helped
him kill lanu so that he could take
the throne men of bara will you
take this lying half-breed for your
king or will you have me for king
-i who am all baran who owe no
loyalty to cholu but think only of
reviving bara and freeing the elec-
trae

  the barans seemed bewildered by
the choice forced upon them they
stared silently at surp and at crain

  philip crain stung by surps lie
cried to them with all his strength

  barans do not believe surp he
means never to release the electrae
for among the electrae are hosts of
surps enemies whom he thrust
among the phantoms by using trick-
ery in the drawing of the lots

  a roar of inarticulate rage flamed
instantly from the whole baran host
every man among them had for his
dream the freeing of the electrae it
was for that they had come upon this
expedition for that that they had
driven toward earths seas

  is this true surp cried hundreds
startling stories

of infuriated voices

  it is true mara declared ligor
himself boasted to me how his father
had for years manipulated the draw-
ing of the lots and bragged that
when surp was on the throne and
bara revived the electrae would
never be freed

surp tried to deny the deadly
charge and could not his face
was terrible as he saw the structure
of crime and ambition which he had
built for so long tumbling about his
ears his tortured eyes swinging al-
most dazedly rested on philip crain
hideous hatred blazed in them

  at least mongrel- he repeated
his sons words in a choking voice i
will take you with me

  he was drawing the gas-gun at his
belt but crain sprang before the
noble could raise the weapon that
desperate leap knocked the gas-gun
from surps hand and then he and
the noble were locked in a death
struggle

  crains anger-filmed eyes glimpsed
mara and skuro staring stonily and
dimly he heard the cry of the baran
soldiers all seemed frozen motion-
less by the spectacle of this swift
deadly combat

  exhausted as he was crain felt a
compelling surge of strength it was
as though memory of surps victims-
of dandor and lanu and kro and
all the others-nerved him he had
his hands around surps throat and
tightened them he seemed not to
feel the smashing blows of the massive
surp he felt nothing knew nothing
but the red flare of rage and hate that
called for satisfaction

  then crain dimly realized that he
was being pulled to his feet by skuro
and mara

  surp he croaked

  he is dead the princess whis-
pered and shuddered

  and crain saw now that surp lay
motionless his eyes protruding his
face purple in death

  mara sobbed against philip crain
as he stood there gasping and stag-
gering

  there was a long dead silence as

the baran army stared then an offi-
cer spoke to crain

  you who were lanus brother are
our rightful king even though you
are only half of baran blood the
officer declared we shall hail you
king if you will promise not to let
your choluan blood affect you-if you
will promise to lead on toward the
sea to get the water that bara needs
no declared crain pantingly but
squarely meeting the questioning eyes
of the baran soldiery i will not lead
you further this invasion of cholu
must cease we shall not strip away
cholus seas and make it a desert
world so that bara may live

  the faces of the baran officers and
soldiers before him became hard and
hostile when they heard

  we cannot stop now exclaimed
the officer who was their spokesman
we hate this invasion this destruc-
tion as much as you do we hate as
you do to make cholu a desert but
bara comes first we must get water
for bara

  but we can get water for bara
here philip crain cried earnestly
without taking one drop of cholus
water

  how asked a hundred skeptical
incredulous voices

  we can take the ice of cholu for
bara cried crain

  his voice throbbed with desperate
eagerness the eagerness that had filled
him ever since his great inspiration
had come to him he explained his
plan to the barans

pon the polar regions of
cholu lie trillions of tons of
frozen water it covers the great ant-
arctic continent thousands of feet
thick it lies as thick upon the vast
island of greenland and all the north
polar regions

  this ice is harmful to cholu it
keeps almost a third of this world
permanently refrigerated too cold for
human habitation and it breeds
great cold storms that scourge this
world makes the winters bitter ham-
pers the lives of everyone on cholu

  and this colossal mass of ice
which cholu would be far better
the prisoner of mars



without embodies enough water to
fill the long-dead seas of bara bara
is a much smaller world than this one
and its seas are not large the ice of
cholu hurled across space by matter-
casters to bara will melt into seas
that will make bara a green fertile
happy world again

  thus both worlds will benefit
equally bara by receiving the water
that will revivify it and make it pos-
sible to release the tragic hordes of
the electrae and cholu this earth
will benefit as much by removal of

we never wanted to harm this world
we were only striving desperately to
save our own

  and a shout of joyful approval went
up from all the baran host

  mara raised a tear-wet beaming
face to philip crain

  you have succeeded she cried
you have done what i deemed impos-
sible-have avoided harming either of
the two worlds and found a way to
benefit both

  crain felt an enormous reaction
that left him weak and trembling he

startling stories

  father can you hear he whis-
pered over maras dark head can
you

chapter xxiv
epilogue

night lay over the raw clearing
that had been blasted out of the
canadian forest a thousand twin-
kling stars looked down upon the
strange scene that was taking place
there

  the great matter-caster clisk was
shimmering with blue radiance dur-
ing the last days it had been hurling
the baran forces in detachments back
to their own world back to the red
spark that glistened brightly in the
star-flecked eastern sky

  philip crain tall and alien-looking
in his royal baran costume of crimson
silk and metal stood near the blazing
disk upon the shimmering disk
waited skuro and a hundred baran
soldiers all around the disk watch-
ing with fascinated eyes were ameri-
can and canadian soldiers and offi-
cials

  crain was speaking to one of those
officials the president of the united
states close beside crain was the
princess mara and john martin kay
and scott fulton were near

  this is the last baran detach-
ment philip crain was saying

  the president nodded earnestly
it all seems like a dream what has
happened he said first that ter-
rific invasion-then the sudden armis-
tice the great plan you advanced no
wonder the world couldnt believe it
at first

  crain nodded it had been an excit-
ing period these weeks since he had
halted the martian armies at the very
edge of new york

  earths officials had at first been in-
credulous when crain had informed
them that the invasion had stopped
and that the martian forces desired an
armistice the incredulity of earths
governments had been even greater
when crain had proposed his great
idea of transferring the vast ice-packs

of earth as water to mars

  there had been hasty excited con-
ferences between crain and represen-
tatives of all earth governments and
when they had found that crain really
could do the thing he proposed all
earth had agreed to the proposals
with unbounded joy and relief

  the matter-casters which the mar-
tians had brought to earth were to be
left here earthmen had been trained
in their use and already the machines
had been set up on the huge ice-caps
of greenland and the north polar
lands and upon antarctica upon the
morrow they would start hurling the
ice to mars there to be melted by the
clear sun of bara into new seas for
that world

  the damage which the martians had
done in their drive toward the sea
would be more than compensated by
the removal of the ice from earth
the warming of its climate and free-
ing of its ice-locked polar lands and
by the new scientific devices which
were now opened to earths use the
fortunate fact that few lives had been
taken by the martian drive made the
negotiations easier

  earth looks forward to a future of
friendship with mars the president
was telling philip crain these mat-
ter-casters will make trade and travel
between the two worlds easy a great
widening of human horizons

  john martin his face struck with
strange wonder spoke now to crain

  to think philip that all this came
about from that fake radio broadcast
that you heard with us that night

  kay had not spoken steadfastly
watching crain now she broke her
silence

  and youre going back to mars
philip

crain nodded his eyes steady on
hers

  i must kay i am king of bara
now-and there is much to do the
water that will come streaming from
earths ice must be directed into the
proper sea bottoms the ruined cities
must be rebuilt and the electrae re-
leased as soon as possible he smiled
down at her but ill not forget
the prisoner of mars



earth my duty calls me to my fa-
thers world but ill be coming back
for visits whenever i can

  we will be coming back krayn
whispered mara

  the baran princess dark eyes were
shining her slim white hand clinging
to crains arm

  kay smiled though there was a
wistful shadow in her eyes

  i knew back there on bara that
you loved her philip said the earth
girl

  knew it from your face that night
in the palace when you came back
from her and im glad it turned out
that way

  and so am i glad crain scott
fulton grinned tucking kays arm in-
side his own with you a hundred
or so million miles away maybe i can
make kay listen to reason

  there was a call from the men at the
switchboard of the great matter-caster
-earthmen who from now on would
operate the big machine

  all ready to go

  good-by all of you crain choked
  he turned from them unsteadily

and then tall and commanding in his
brilliant royal cloak he was moving
with mara toward the shimmering
disk

  skuro and the other barans waiting
on the disk shouted welcome and
the fascinated earth people watch-
ing saw crain standing among them
maras proud slim figure by his side
as he waved farewell

 the switches were flung the
watchers saw a dazzling blast of force
burst upward from the disk transform-
ing those upon it into shining clouds
that hurtled up and outward at veloc-
ity inconceivable outward toward
the starry sky toward the red spark
eastward the matter-caster awaiting
them on bara

  hes gone kay whispered and
suddenly she was weeping

  scott fulton pulled her closer com-
fortingly and john martin looking
up at the glittering stars the stars
from which long years ago the father
of philip crain had come nodded his
great head slowly

  yes hes gone said martin slow-

stand the test of time

  because pygmalions spectacles by

we are nominating it for scientific-

print-another favorite of the past

  will you vote for your favorite write
and tell us what it is

  we hope in this way to bring a new per-
manence to the science fiction gems of yes-

science fiction devotees of today and to-
morrow

but what is reality asked the

buildings that loomed around central
park with their countless windows
glowing like the cave fires of a city of
cro-magnon people all is dream
all is illusion i am your vision as you

  dan burke struggling for clarity of
thought through the fumes of liquqr

stared without comprehension at the
tiny figure of his companion he be-

driven him to leave the party to seek
fresh air in the park but he had need-

the irony is that even reality is a

cracked thought dan again

 or so concluded the other says

eh

  you know him then the philo-

taste the object but that we have only
the sensation of seeing feeling hear-
ing tasting

  i-sort of recall it

g weinbaum

 hah but sensations are men-
tal phenomena they exist in our
minds he waved again at the light-
flecked buildings yon do not see
that wall of masonry you perceive
only a sensation a feeling of sight
the rest you interpret

  you see the same thing retorted
dan

  how do you know i do even if
you knew that what i call red would
not be green if you could see through
my eyes-even if you knew that how
do you know that i too am not a dream
of yours

  dan laughed of course nobody
knows anything you just get what
information you can through the win-
dows of your five senses and then
make your guesses when youre
wrong you pay the penalty his
mind was clear now save for a mild
headache listen he said sud-
denly you can argue a real thing
away to an illusion thats easy but
if your friend berkeley is right why
cant you take a dream and make it
real if it works one way it must
work the other

startling stories

felt that something more quivered on
the verge of utterance

  thats an evasion he grunted
anybody can tell the difference be-
tween a picture and the real thing or
between a movie and life

  but whispered the other the
realer the better no and if one
could make a-a movie-very real in-
deed what would you say then
nobody can though

  the eyes glittered strangely again
i can he whispered i did
did what

  made real a dream the voice
turned angry fools i bring it here
to sell to westman the camera people
and what do they say it isnt clear
only one person can use it at a time
its too expensive fools fools
huh

w isten im albert ludwig-
ma professor ludwig as dan was
silent he continued it means noth-
ing to you eh but listen-a movie
that gives one sight and sound sup-
pose now i add taste smell even
touch if your interest is taken by the
story suppose i make it so that you
are in the story you speak to the sha-
dows and the shadows reply and in-
stead of being on a screen the story
is all about you and you are in it
would that be to make real a dream
how the devil could you do that
how how but simply first
my liquid positive then my magic
spectacles i photograph the story in
a liquid with light-sensitive chro-
mates i build up a complex solution
-do you see i add taste chemically
and sound electrically and when the
story is recorded then i put the solu-
tion in my spectacles-my movie pro-
jector i electrolyze the solution
break it down the older chromates go
first and out comes the story sight
sound smell taste-all

  touch

  if your interest is taken your mind
supplies that eagerness crept into
his voice you will look at it mr

 

  burke said dan a swindle
he thought then a spark of reckless-
ness glowed out of the vanishing

fumes of alcohol why not he
grunted

  he rose ludwig standing came
scarcely to his shoulder a queer
gnomelike old man dan thought as
he followed him across the park and
into one of the scores of apartment ho-
tels in the vicinity

  in his room ludwig fumbled in a
bag producing a device vaguely rem-
iniscent of a gas mask with goggles
and a rubber mouthpiece dan exam-
ined it curiously while the little
bearded professor brandished a bottle
of water liquid

  here it is he gloated my liquid
positive the story hard photogra-
phy infernally hard therefore the
simplest possible story a utopia-
just two characters and you the audi-
ence now put the spectacles on put
them on and tell me what fools the
westman people are

  he decanted some of the liquid into
the mask and trailed a twisted wire
to a device on the table a rectifier
he explained for the electrolysis
must you use all the liquid asked
dan if you use part do you see on-
ly part of the story and which
part

  every drop has all of it but you
must fill the eye-pieces then as
dan slipped the device gingerly on
so now what do you see

  not a damn thing just the window
and the lights across the street

  of course but now i start the
electrolysis now

  there was a moment of chaos the
liquid before dans eyes clouded sud-
denly white and formless sounds
buzzed he moved to tear the device
from his head but emerging forms in
the mistiness caught his interest
giant things were writhing

  the scene steadied the whiteness
was dissipating like mist in summer
unbelieving still gripping the arms
of that unseen chair he was staring
at a forest incredible unearthly
beautiful smooth boles ascended in-
conceivably toward a brightening sky
trees bizarre as the forests of the car-
boniferous age infinitely overhead
swayed misty fronds and the verdure
showed brown and green in the
pygmalions spectacles



heights and there were birds - at
least curiously lovely pipings and
twitterings were all about him though
he saw no creatures-thin elfin whis-
tlings like fairy bugles sounded soft-
ly-

  he sat frozen entranced a louder
fragment of melody drifted down to
him mounting in exquisite ecstatic
bursts now clear as sounding metal
now soft as remembered music for
a moment he forgot the chair whose
arms he gripped the miserable hotel
room he imagined himself solitary
in the midst of that lovely glade
eden he muttered and the swell-
ing music of unseen voices answered

some measure of reason returned
illusion he told himself clev-
er optical devices not reality he
groped for the chairs arm found it
and clung to it he scraped his feet
and found again an inconsistency to
his eyes the ground was mossy ver-
dure  to his touch it was merely a thin
hotel carpet

  the elfin buglings sounded gently
a faint deliciously sweet perfume
breathed against him he began to
want to believe that all this was no il-
lusion that it was true

  and then far through the softening
mists he caught a movement that was
not the swaying of verdure a shim-
mer of silver more solid than mist
something approached he watched
the figure as it moved now visible now
hidden by trees very soon he per-
ceived that it was human but it was
almost upon him before he realized
that it was a girl

  she wore a robe of silvery half-
translucent stuff luminous as star-
beams her tiny white feet were bare
to the mossy forest floor as she stood
at no more than a pace from him star-
ing dark-eyed the thin music sound-
ed again she smiled

  dan summoned stumbling thoughts
was this being also-illusion had
she no more reality than the loveliness
of the forest he opened his lips to
speak but a strained excited voice
sounded in his ears who are you

 had he spoken the voice had
come as if from another like the

sound of ones words in fever

  the girl smiled again english
she said in queer soft tones i can
speak a little english she spoke
slowly carefully i learned it from
c-she hesitated-my mothers fath-
er whom they call the gray weav-
er

  again came the voicc in dans ears
who are you

  i am called galatea she said i
came to find you

  to find me echoed the voice that
was dans

  lexicon who is called the gray
weaver told me she explained smil-
ing he said you will stay with us
until the second moon from this
what are you called

  dan he muttered his voice
sounded oddly different

  what a strange name said the
girl she stretched out her bare arm
come she smiled

  dan touched her extended hand
feeling without any surprise the liv-
ing warmth of her rosy fingers he
had forgotten the paradoxes of illu-
sion this was no longer illusion to
him but reality itself it seemed to
him that he followed her walking
over the shadowed turf that gave with
springy crunch beneath his tread
though galatea left hardly an imprint
he glanced down noting that he him-
self wore a silver garment and that
his feet were bare with the glance he
felt a feathery breeze on his body and
a sense of mossy earth on his feet

  galatea said his voice galatea
what place is this what language
do you speak

  she glanced back laughing why
this is paracosma of course and that
is our language

  paracosma muttered dan para-
-cosma a fragment of greek that
had survived somehow from a sopho-
more course a decade in the past came
strangely back to him paracosma
land beyond-the-world

  galatea cast a smiling glance at
him does the real world seem
strange she queried after that sha-
dow world of yours

  shadow land echoed dan bewil-


startling stories

dered this is shadow not my
world

  the girls smile turned quizzical
poof she retorted with an impu-
dently lovely pout and i suppose
then that i am the phantom instead of
you she laughed do i seem
ghost-like

dan made no reply he was puzzl-
ing over unanswerable questions
as he trod behind the lithe figure of
his guide it seemed a mile perhaps
before a sound of tinkling water ob-
scured that other strange music they
emerged on the bank of a little river
swift and crystalline that rippled and
gurgled galatea bent over the brink
and cupped her hands raising a few
mouthsful of water to her lips dan
followed her example finding the
liquid stinging cold

  how do we cross he asked

  you can wade up there but i al-
ways cross here she poised herself
for a moment on the green bank then
dove like a silver arrow into the pool
dan followed the water stung his
body like champagne but a stroke or
two carried him across to where gal-
atea had already emerged with a glis-
tening of creamy bare limbs her gar-
ment clung tight as a metal sheath to
her wet body he felt a breath-tak-
ing thrill at the sight of her and then
miraculously the silver cloth was dry
the droplets rolled off as if from oiled
silk and they moved briskly on the
sweet pipings followed them now
loud now whisper-soft in a tenuous
web of melody

  galatea said dan suddenly
where is the music coming from

  she looked back amazed you silly
one she laughed from the flow-
ers of course see she plucked a
purple star and held it to his ear true
enough a faint and plaintive melody
hummed out of the blossom she
tossed it in his startled face and
skipped on

  soon they beheld the objective of
their journey-a building of white
marble-like stone single-storied and
vine covered with broad glassless
windows they trod upon a path of
bright pebbles to the arched entrance

and here on an intricate stone bench
sat a gray-bearded patriarchal individ-
ual galatea addressed him in a liquid
language that reminded dan of the
flower-pipings then she turned this
is leucon she said as the ancient
rose from his seat and spoke in
english

  we are happy galatea and i to
welcome you since visitors are a rare
pleasure here and those from your
shadowy country most rare

 dan uttered puzzled words of
thanks and the old man nodded re-
seating himself on the carven bench
galatea skipped through the arched
entrance and dan after an irresolute
moment dropped to the remaining
bench once more his thoughts were
whirling in perplexed turbulence
was all this indeed but illusion was
he sitting in actuality in a prosaic
hotel room peering through magic
spectacles that pictured this world
about him or was he transported by
some miracle really sitting here in
this land of loveliness

  leucon said his voice how did
you know i was coming

  i was told said the other

 by whom

  by no one

 why-someone must have told
you

  the gray weaver shook his solemn
head i was just told

  dan ceased his questioning con-
tent for the moment to drink in the
beauty about him and then galatea
returned bearing a crystal bowl of the
strange fruits they were piled in
colorful disorder red purple orange
and yellow pear-shaped egg-shaped
and clustered spheroids - fantastic
unearthly he selected a pale trans-
parent ovoid bit into it and was del-
uged by a flood of sweet liquid to
the amusement of the girl

alatea he said do you
ever go to a city what cities
are in paracosma

- cities what are cities

  places where many people live
close together

  oh said the girl frowning no
there are no cities here
pygmalions spectacles



  then where are the people of para-
cosma you must have neighbors
the girl looked puzzled a man
and a woman live off there she said
gesturing toward a distant blue range
of hills dim on the horizon far
away over there i went there once
but leucon and i prefer the valley
but galatea protested dan are
you and leucon alone in this valley
where-what happened to your par-
ents-your father and mother

  they went away that way-to-
ward the sunrise theyll return
some day

  and if they dont

  why foolish one what could
hinder them

  wild beasts said dan poison-
ous insects disease flood storm law-
less people death

  i never heard those words said
galatea there are no such things
here she sniffed contemptuously
lawless people

  not-death

  what is death

  its- dan paused helplessly its
like falling asleep and never waking
its what happens to everyone at the
end of life

  i never heard of such a thing as the
end of life said the girl decidedly
there isnt such a thing

  what happens then queried dan
desperately when one grows old
nothing silly no one grows old
unless he wants to like leucon a
person grows to the age he likes best
and then stops its a law

  dan gathered his chaotic thoughts
he stared into galateas dark lovely
eyes have you stopped yet

  the dark eyes dropped he was
amazed to see a deep embarrassed
flush spread over her cheeks she
looked at leucon nodding reflectively
on his bench then back to dan meet-
ing his gaze

  not yet she said

and when will you galatea
when i have had the one child per-
mitted me you see - she stared
down at her dainty toes-one cannot
-have children-afterwards

  permitted permitted by whom
  by a law

  laws is everything here gov-
erned by laws what of chance and
accidents

  what are those-chance and acci-
dents

 things unexpected-things un-
foreseen

  nothing is unforeseen said gala-
tea still soberly she repeated slowly
nothing is unforeseen he fancied
her voice was wistful

  leucon looked up enough of this
he said abruptly he turned to dan
i know these words of yours-
chance disease death they are not
for paracosma keep them in your
unreal country

  where did you hear them then
from galateas mother said the
gray weaver who had them from
your predecessor-a phantom who vis-
ited here before galatea was born
dan had a vision of ludwigs face
what was he like

  much like you

  but his name

the old mans mouth was sudden-
ly grim we do not speak of
him he said and rose entering the
dwelling in cold silence

  he goes to weave said galatea af-
ter a moment her lovely piquant
face was still troubled

  what does he weave

  this she fingered the silver
cloth of her gown he weaves it out
of metal bars on a very clever machine
i do not know the method

  who made the machine

  it was here

  but galatea who built the
house who planted these fruit
trees

  they were here the house and
trees were always here

  dan thought a moment were you
born here

  i dont know he noted in sud-
den concern that her eyes were glis-
tening with tears

  galatea dear why are you un-
happy whats wrong

  why nothing she shook her
black curls smiled suddenly at him
what could be wrong how can
one be unhappy in paracosma she
startling stories

sprang erect and seized his hand
come lets gather fruit for to-
morrow

  she darted off in a whirl of flashing
silver and dan followed her around
the wing of the edifice graceful as
a dancer she leaped for a branch
above her head caught it laughingly
and tossed a great golden globe to
him she loaded his arms with the
bright prizes and sent him back for
the crystal bowl that reposed empty
on the bench and when he returned
she piled it so full of fruit that a del-
uge of colorful spheres dropped
around him

  the little sun was losing itself be-
hind the trees of that colossal forest
to the west and a coolness stirred
among long shadows of a sudden
the flowers were still and the brook
gurgled alone in a world of silence
in silence too dan followed galatea
through a doorway

  the chamber within was a spacious
one floored with large black and
white squares exquisite benches of
carved marble were here and there
old leucon in a far corner bent over
an intricate glistening mechanism
and as dan entered he drew a shining
length of silver cloth from it folded
it and placed it carefully aside

  galatea stood in a doorway to his
left leaning half-wearily against the
frame he placed the bowl of fruits
on a bench at the entrance and moved
to her side

  this is yours she said indicating
the room beyond he looked in upon
a pleasant smaller chamber a single
glowing sphere pendant by a chain
from the ceiling illuminated the
room dan turned to the girl whose
eyes were still unwontedly serious

  this is ideal he said but gala-
tea how am i to turn out the light

  turn it out she said you must
cap it-so a faint smile showed
again on her lips as she dropped a
metal covering over the shining
sphere they stood tense in the dark-
ness dan sensed her nearness aching-
ly and then the light was on once
more she moved toward the door
and there paused taking his hand

  dear shadow she said softly i

hope your dreams are music she
was gone

  dan stood irresolute in his cham-
ber he glanced into the large room
where leucon still bent over his work
and the gray weaver raised a hand
in solemn salutation but said nothing
he felt no urge for the old mans si-
lent company and turned back into
his room to prepare for slumber

he slept almost instantly it
seemed the dawn was upon him
and bright elfin pipings were all
about him while the odd ruddy sun
sent a broad slanting plane of light
across the room he rose as fully
aware of his surroundings as if he had
not slept at all he emerged into the
central chamber noting curiously
that the globes still glowed in dim ri-
valry to the daylight he touched
one casually it was cool as metal to
his fingers and lifted freely from its
standard for a moment he held the
cold flaming thing in his hands then
replaced it and wandered into the
dawn

  galatea was dancing up the path
eating a strange fruit as rosy as her
lips she was merry again once more
the happy nymph who had greeted
him and she gave him a bright smile
as he chose a sweet green ovoid for his
breakfast

  come on she called to the
river

  she skipped away toward the un-
believable forest dan followed
then they were laughing in the pool
splashing about until galatea drew
herself to the bank glowing and pant-
ing strangely he was neither tired
nor breathless with no sense of exer-
tion a question recurred to him as
yet unasked

  galatea said his voice whom
will you take as mate

  her eyes went serious i dont
know she said at the proper time
he will come that is a law

  and will you be happy

  of course she seemed troubled
-isnt everyone happy

  not where i live galatea

  then that must be a strange place
-that ghostly world of yours a
pygmalions spectacles



 rather terrible place

   it is often enough dan agreed
 i wish- he paused what did he
 wish was he not talking to an illu-
 sion a dream an apparition he
 looked at the girl at her glistening
 black hair her eyes her soft white
 skin and then for a tragic moment
 he tried to feel the arms of that drab
 hotel chair beneath his hands-and
 failed he smiled he reached out
 his fingers to touch her bare arm and
 for an instant she looked back at him
 with startled sober eyes and sprang
 to her feet

   come on i want to show you my
 country she set off down the
 stream and dan rose reluctantly to
 follow

   what a day that was they traced
 the little river from still pool to sing-
 ing rapids and ever about them were
 the strange twitterings and pipings
 that were the voices of the flowers
 they talked or were silent galatea
 twisted him a bright-blossomed gar-
 land for his head and thereafter he
 moved always with a sweet singing
 about him but little by little the red
 sun slanted toward the forest and the
 hours dripped away it was dan who
 pointed it out and reluctantly they
 turned homewards

   galatea sang a strange song plain-
 tive and sweet and again her eyes
 were sad

   what song is that he asked

   it is a song sung by another gala-
 tea she answered who is my moth-
 er she laid her hand on his arm
 i will make it into english for you
 she sang

 the river lies in flower and fern

    in flower and fern it breathes a song

 it breathes a song of your return

    of your return in years too long

 in years too long its murmurs bring-

    its murmurs bring their vain replies
 their vain replies the flowers sing

    the flowers sing the river lies

her voice quavered on the final
notes there was silence save for
the tinkle of water and the flower bu-
gles dan said galatea- and
paused the girl was again somber-
eyed tearful he said huskily thats

 a sad song galatea why was your
 mother sad you said everyone was
 happy in paracosma

  she broke the law replied the
 girl tonelessly it is the inevitable
 way to sorrow she faced him she
 fell in love with a phantom galatea
 said one of your shadowy race
 who came and stayed and then had to
 go back so when her appointed lover
 came it was too late do you under-
 stand  but she yielded finally to the
 law and is forever unhappy and goes
 wandering from place to place about
 the world she paused i shall never
 break a law she said defiantly

  dan took her hand i would not
 have you unhappy galatea i want
 you always happy

  she shook her head i am happy
 she said and smiled a tender wistful
 smile

   they were silent a long time as they
 trudged the way homeward leucon
 sat on his bench by the portal

   i am very tired galatea said and
 slipped within

  dan moved to follow but the old
 man raised a staying hand

   friend from the shadows he said
 will you hear me a moment

  dan paused acquiesced and
dropped to the opposite bench he
felt a sense of foreboding nothing
pleasant awaited him

  there is something to be said
 leucon continued and i say it with-
 out desire to pain you if phantoms
 feel pain it is this galatea loves you
 though i think she has not yet realized
 it

   i love her too said dan

  then woe to both of you for this
 is impossible in paracosma it is a
 confiiction with the laws galateas
 mate is appointed perhaps even now
 approaching

  laws laws muttered dan
whose laws are they not galateas
nor mine

  but they exist said the gray
 weaver it is not for you nor for
 me to criticize them-though i yet
 wonder what power could annul them
 to permit your presence here

 i had no voice in your laws

 the old man peered at him in the


startling stories

 dusk has anyone anywhere a voice
 in the laws he queried

  in my country we have retorted
dan

  madness growled leucon man-
made laws of what use are man-
made laws with only man-made pen-
alties or none at all if you shadows
make a law that the wind shall blow
only from the east does the west wind
obey it

  some of our laws may be stupid
but theyre no more unjust than
yours

  ours said the gray weaver are
the unalterable laws of the world the
laws of nature violation is always
unhappiness i have seen it i have
known it in another in galateas
mother though galatea is stronger
than she he paused now he
continued i ask only for mercy
your stay is short and i ask that you
do no more harm than is already done
be merciful give her no more to re-
gret

  dan turned silent and unhappy to
his own chamber

  again he rose at the glow of dawn
and again galatea was before him
meeting him at the door with her bowl
of fruit she deposited her burden
giving him a wan little smile of greet-
ing and stood facing him as if wait-
ing

  come with me galatea he said

  where

  to the river bank to talk

they trudged in silence to the
brink of galateas pool dan noted
a subtle difference in the world about
him outlines were vague the thin
flower pipings less audible and the
very landscape was queerly unstable
shifting like smoke when he wasnt
looking at it directly and strangely
though he had brought the girl here
to talk to her he had now nothing to
say but sat in aching silence with his
eyes on the loveliness of her face

  galatea pointed at the red ascending
sun so short a time she said be-
fore you go back to your phantom
world i shall be sorry very sorry
she touched his cheek with her fin-
gers dear shadow

  suppose said dan huskily that
i wont go what if i wont leave
here his voice grew fiercer ill
not go im going to stay

  the calm mournfulness of the girls
face checked him he felt the irony of
struggling against the inevitable pro-
gress of a dream she spoke had
i the making of the laws you should
stay but you cant dear one you
cant

  forgotten now were the words of
the gray weaver i love you gal-
atea he said

  and i you she whispered see
dearest shadow how i break the same
law my mother broke and am glad to
face the sorrow it will bring she
placed her hand tenderly over his
leucon is very wise and i am bound
to obey him but this is beyond his
wisdom because he let himself grow
old she paused he let himself
grow old she repeated slowly a
strange light gleamed in her dark eyes
as she turned suddenly to dan

dear one she said tensely that
thing that happens to the old-that
death of yours what follows it
what follows death he echoed
who knows

  but- her voice was quivering
but one cant simply-vanish there
must be an awakening

  who knows said dan again
there are those who believe we wake
to a happier world but- he shook
his head hopelessly

  it must be true oh it must be
galatea cried there must be more
for you than the mad world you speak
of she leaned very close suppose
dear she said that when my ap-
pointed lover arrives i send him away
suppose i have no child but let my-
self grow old older than leucon old
until death would i join you in your
happier world

  galatea he cried distractedly
oh my dearest-what a terrible
thought

  more terrible than you know
she whispered still very close to him
it is more than violation of the law
it is rebellion everything is planned
everything was foreseen except this
and if i have no child her place will
pygmalions spectacles



be left unfilled and the places of her
children and of their children and so
on until some day the whole great plan
of paracosma fails of whatever its
destiny was to be her whisper grew
very faint and fearful it is destruc-
tion but i love you more than i fear
-death

  dans arms were about her no
galatea no promise me

  she murmured i can promise and
then break my promise she drew his
head down their lips touched and he
felt a fragrance and a taste like honey
in her kiss at least she breathed
i can give you a name by which to
love you philometros measure of
my love

  a name muttered dan a fan-
tastic idea shot through his mind-a
way of proving to himself that all this
was reality and not just a page that
any one could read who wore old lud-
wigs magic spectacles if galatea
would speak his name perhaps he
thought daringly perhaps then he
could stay he thrust her away

  galatea he cried do you re-
member my name

she nodded silently her unhappy
eyes on his

  then say it say it dear

  she stared at him dumbly misera-
bly but made no sound

  say it galatea he pleaded des-
perately my name dear-just my
name her mouth moved she grew
pale with effort and dan could have
sworn that his name trembled on her
quivering lips though no sound came

  at last she spoke i cant dearest
one oh i cant a law forbids it
she stood suddenly erect pallid as
ivory carving leucon calls she
said and darted away dan followed
along the pebbled path but her speed
was beyond his powers at the portal
he found only the gray weaver stand-
ing cold and stern he raised his hand
as dan appeared

your time is short he said go
thinking of the havoc you have done
wheres galatea gasped dan

  i have sent her away the old
man blocked the entrance for a mo-
ment dan would have struck him

aside but something withheld him he
stared wildly about the meadow-
there a flash of silver beyond the
river at the edge of the forest he
turned and raced toward it while mo-
tionless and cold the gray weaver
watched him go

 galatea he called galatea

  but the world was growing cloudy
paracosma was dissolving around him
hopelessly he cried out her name-
galatea

  after an endless time he paused
something familiar about the spot
struck him and just as the red sun
edged above him he recognized the
place-the very point at which he had
entered paracosma a sense of futil-
ity overwhelmed him as for a moment
he gazed on an unbelievable apparition
-a dark window hung in mid-air be-
fore him through which glowed rows
of electric lights ludwigs window

  it vanished but the trees writhed
and the sky darkened and he swayed
dizzily in turmoil he realized sud-
denly that he was no longer standing
but sitting in the midst of the crazy
glade and his hands clutched some-
thing smooth and hard-the arms of
the miserable hotel chair then at
last he saw her close before him-
galatea with sorrow-stricken fea-
tures her fear-filled eyes on his he
made a terrific effort to rise stood
erect and fell sprawling in a blaze of
corruscating lights

  he struggled to his knees walls-
ludwigs room-encompassed him he
must have slipped from the chair
the magic spectacles lay before him
one lens splintered and spilling a
fluid no longer water-clear but white
as milk

  god he muttered

he felt shaken sick exhausted
with a bitter sense of bereave-
ment and his head ached fiercely the
room was drab disgusting he wanted
to get out of it he glanced automat-
ically at his watch four oclock-he
must have sat here nearly five hours
for the first time he noticed ludwigs
absence he was glad of it and walked
dully out of the door to an automatic
elevator there was no response to


startling stories

his ring someone was using the thing
he walked three flights to the street
and back to his own room

  in love with a vision worse-in
love with a girl who had never lived
in a fantastic utopia that was literally
nowhere he threw himself on his
bed with a groan that was half a sob

  he saw finally the implication of the
same galatea galatea-pygmalions
statue given life by venus in the an-
cient grecian myth but his galatea
warm and lovely and vital must re-
main forever without the gift of life
since he was neither pygmalion nor
god

  he woke late in the morning star-
ing uncomprehendingly about for the
fountain and pool of paracosma slow
comprehension dawned how much-
how much-of last nights experience
had been real how much was the
product of alcohol or had old lud-
wig been right and was there no dif-
ference between reality and dream

  he changed his rumpled attire and
wandered despondently to the street
he found ludwigs hotel at last in-
quiry revealed that the diminutive
professor had checked out leaving no
forwarding address

  what of it even ludwig couldnt
give what he sought a living galatea
dan was glad that he had disappeared
he hated the little professor profes-
sor hypnotists called themselves
professors he dragged through
a weary day and then a sleepless night
on the train to chicago where his
home was



it was mid-winter when he saw a
suggestively tiny figure ahead of
him in the loop ludwig his cry
was automatic professor ludwig

  the elfin figure turned recognized
him smiled they stepped into the
shelter of a building

  im sorry about your machine pro-
fessor id be glad to pay for the dam-
age

  oh that was nothing-a cracked
lens but you-have you been ill
you look much the worse

  its nothing said dan your
show was marvelous professor-
marvelous id have told you so but
you were gone when it ended

  ludwig shrugged i went to the
lobby for a cigar

  it was marvelous repeated dan
so real smiled the other only
because you co-operated then it
takes self-hypnosis

  it was real all right agreed dan
glumly i dont understand it-that
strange beautiful country

  the trees were club-mosses en-
larged by a lens said ludwig all
was trick photography but stereo-
scopic as i told you-three dimen-
sional the fruits were rubber the
house is a summer building on our
campus-northern university and
the voice was mine you didnt speak
at all except your name at the first
and i left a blank for that i played
your part you see i went around with
the photographic apparatus strapped
on my head to keep the viewpoint
always that of the observer see
he grinned wryly luckily im
rather short or youd have seemed a
giant

  wait a minute said dan his
mind whirling you say you played
my part then galatea-is she real
too

  teas real enough said the pro-
fessor my niece a senior at north-
ern and likes dramatics she helped
me out with the thing why want
to meet her

  dan answered eagerly happily an
ache had vanished a pain was erased
paracosma was attained at last

thumbnail sketches of great men and achievements
by mort wiisisger

the twist of a dial

the electric motor hummed plaintively as it drove the gears connected
to three whirling perforated plates that composed the first crude tele-
vision receiver the hand of john logie baird trembled as he carefully
tuned the condensers that were picking up radio impulses emanated by the
transmitter in the next room

   his hand trembled partly because he had been working slavishly for long
hours barely taking time to sleep n or had his meals been regular conse-
quently he was thin and undernourish ed as he had been for two years also
his attic workroom was poorly heated and outside howled a cold autumn
wind it was october  in london

   but the tall scots hand trembled mostly because its manipulation would
soon tell him whether he had succeeded-or failed again friends business
acquaintances learned engineers had all told - ---------- -

him he was a fool to hope to achieve his aim

to broadcast images over radio waves was
fantastic impossible they had advised him

john logie baird

to go back into the business world where he
belonged selling soap and food products

perhaps this very twist of the dial this
instant would decide his future for him if

he failed now he might have to give up
utterly since both his health and credit were
near exhaustion

if he succeeded on the other hand-if the

face of the boy in the next room appeared
on his flickering screen-then money and
backing would be forthcoming and he would
be able to go on and perfect the machine

  there-the condensers were tuned little
willy tayntons face should appear baird
looked eagerly at the ground-glass screen
which glowed faintly

  but no face was there nothing not even
an outline or the faintest interplay of light
and shadow failure

  baird slumped back his thin shoulders
drooped as though his whole spirit had been
drained from him failure the thought
was bitter after all he had sacrificed

  he tried to think of something that might
have gone wrong but the apparatus was
working smoothly the fluctuating bulb was
releasing its light signals from the trans-
mitter in the next room

  the three perforated discs were perfectly
synchronized splitting the light beam into a
tiny pencil that moved dozens of times a
second across the screen forming a square
of light but the square of light showed no
image the boys face was not being trans-
mitted as he had hoped

  so the machine was a failure-junkl all
its mechanical ingenuity was a delusion as
the outlines of the dummys head he had
thought hed seen an hour ago was an illu-
sion junk-failure-back to selling soap-
fool-debts-john logie bairds mind was
agonized in that moment of defeat

  he stepped wearily into the next room to

 
tell the boy he could leave suddenly his
head jerked up his eyes widened the boy
instead of sitting in front of the scanning
lens where baird had placed him was back
from it out of range

  i-i cant stand it-the lights are too
hot stammered the boy thats why i left
my seat

 nonsense snapped baird he drew a
half-crown coin from his pocket his last and
offered it the boy snatched it and bravely
sat in the proper position squinting against

the bright scanning light

  the inventor his heart singing with re-
newed hope ran back to the receiving room
suddenly he let out a wild exultant whoop
the half-frightened face of willy taynton
stared out at him from the glass screen
it was a dim image a little distorted and at
times it flickered and danced-but it was
unmistakably a face that could be recog-
nized

  another milestone in the development of
television had been reached

the inventor nobody knew

glistening beads of sweat trickled from young thomas davenports
furrowed brows as he pounded his anvil the angry roar of the furnace swirl-
ing in his ears the mighty blows sent ripples along the muscles of his corded
arms as he battered the shapeless metal into useful form

occasionally the youth paused a moment from his labors he would gaze
wistfully to his right there stood his employer the best blacksmith in wil-
liamston vermont it was fun to see him work his boss was a skinny man
about as strong as a scarecrow yet he did his work skillfully

the reason was a strange one tom davenports employer did not use the

heavy hammer and anvil to mould his horse-
shoes his chains no he used a wondrous
mechanical device  a trip-hammer  a
mechanical hammer deriving its energy from
water power

  this mechanical device fascinated young
davenport he realized fully the superiority

thomas davenport

of the machine as compared to bare hands
he thought of his own little workshop at
home wheels cogs wires-some day he
would invent something from all these dona-
tions given him by the junkman

  the years rolled by davenport moved to
brandon vermont there he married but
he still kept dreaming some day he would
invent something that would bring him fame
and fortune all he wanted was one idea

  then one summer day in  his brother
oliver brought him interesting news

  tom his brother told him theyve got
something new in crown point new york

 professor joseph henry of albany has in-
 vented a great magnetic battery why they
 say its so powerful it can suspend a black-
 smiths anvil in mid-air

  right then and there tom davenport
 made up his mind

   ive got to see that magnet oliver he
 said determinedly and youve got to help
 me

   so the two brothers left their home in
 vermont for weeks they traveled with
 their horse and cart until they arrived in
 crown point there they found the fabled
 magnet tom studied it carefully why it
 looked like an ordinary horseshoe like the
 ones he had made as a youth there were
 few differences the arms were about ten
 inches long and were wound with wire back
 and forth

   breathlessly the davenports watched a
 demonstration of the magnets powers that
 very day by the wizardry of the invisible
 electrical energy the magnet was able to
 suspend heavy metal objects many feet
 from the ground

   theres a future in that tom told his
 brother a new power for the human race
    something to take the place of steam
 and save the lives lost by the explosions of
 engines of today oliver weve got to buy
 that magnet

   professor henry wanted seventy-five dol-
 lars for his magic magnet he might just as
 well have asked for seventy-five thousand
 dollars for both brothers were penniless
 finally the two brothers sold their horse
 and cart exchanged the money for the mag-
 net and began their weary trail home but
 their steps were light the treasure was
  theirs

   home oliver davenport thought of an
 idea

  look tom he said we can make
 money exhibiting this magnet there are
 many people who would pay a small price to
sep it work

  but tom davenport wasnt listening he
was dreaming again

  if this magnet weighing three pounds
he said aloud to himself can lift one hun-
dred and fifty pounds i wonder how much
a magnet weighing one hundred pounds
could lift but first ive got to understand
how this one works

  suddenly amid startled protests from his
brother tom davenport began taking apart
the valuable magnet he pried away every
inch of wire uncoiled the entire works
hours later he finished at last he under-
stood the mechanical principles behind the
operation of the magnet now he was go-
ing to build a bigger and better one

  the original magnet was wound with silk
for insulation where was he going to get
the expensive fabric for his experiments
he thought for a moment then consulted
his wife emilie yes she would get him
the silk he needed she had but one beauti-
ful dress the dress she had worn at her
wedding when as a bride she had promised
to be tom davenports wife    for better
or worse

  tom davenport took that dress ripped it
into multiple strands and eventually suc-
ceeded in manufacturing his giant magnet
in july  he was able to move a wheel
about seven inches in diameter at the rate
of about thirty revolutions a minute with a
variation of his device it was the greatest
thrill of his life

 like pitch and runmey davenport was
ahead of his time the steam engine and
tne locomotive were just coming into their
own in public regard and conditions had not
yet arisen demanding other forms of power
as a matter of fact more than thirty years
passed after davenports death before cither
the elcctric motor or the electric railway be-
came actualities

  when they did they incorporated daven-
ports ideas with incidental improvements
although he died a poor man davenport
had actually produced the electric motor
which had been the pioneer of millions of
motors now running all over the world and
should be listed with the immortal bene-
factors of mankind

  thomas davenport had waited years for
his idea-and the world will be using it for
many years to come

the great prediction

the famous edmund hailey stared into the shining eager eyes of the
youth seated beside him and scrubbed his snowy white beard the boy
alexis claude clairaut was not yet out of his teens yet hailey a man of
seventy-five felt like a child in his presence

   the boys voice was level mature though he was young in years there
was much about his bearing that stamped him as a man hailey had mar-
veled at many wonders in his more than seven decades of life but never had
he seen so much wisdom stored in one curly-locked head

   then professor hailey the boy said respectfully if your calculations
are correct the great comet of -the comet they have named haileys
comet in your honor-should return in our 

skies fifteen years from now in the year
 we will be able to see your comet

then

  professor edmund hailey smiled wanly
no alexis he said falteringly we wont
be able to see the return of this comet i
am an old man to see this great comet
but once in a lifetime is fortunate indeed
but you are young and you will live to see
it blaze in the heavens

  the boy remained quiet for a moment re-
gretful for the thoughdess way he had
worded his question

  tell me please professor hailey he
said at last why are you so certain the
comet will appear at the time you predict
the aged astronomer extended his arm
and tapped the sheaf of papers on his desk
with his index finger

  proof my boy he declared huskily
and ive got it the chronicles of scien-
tists before us    the records of civiliza-
tion they all point to one unimpeachable
fact    that this great comet has a closed
orbit and returns to our skies every seventy-
six years by determining the parabolic ele-
ments of a number of comets from recorded
observations i have identified the comet of

 with one which had previously appeared
in  and with one which was observed by
apian at ingolstadt in  thus i am ex-
tremely confident in my prediction that this
comet will return at the end of the year


  the boy rose i cant tell you how grate-
ful i am for this meeting with you professor
hailey he said earnestly i shall never
forget it your calculations are truly mirac-
ulous but i must go now sir it is getting
late

  stay my son hailey urged you make
an old man happy i would like to tell you
how the perihelion distance of this comet
was discovered

  young alexis clairaut shifted his weight
from his right foot to his left he fumbled
with his hat uneasily

  i am sorry professor hailey the nine-
teen-year-old lad said nervously but i
really must leave you see i am scheduled
to give a lecture tonight at the academy of
science wont you come along

  professor haileys eyes archcd upward
he had almost forgotten alexis clairaut
was a genius at the age of  he had studied


abstruse works on infinitesimal analysis and
conical sections before he was  he had
presented a memoir on curves to the french
academy of sciences at  he had published
his first work on curves of double curvature
and at  he had been elected a member of
the academy

  the old scientist shook his head run
along alexis he said softly but visit me
again-soon

  alexis claude clairaut never saw the dis-
tinguished astronomer again for hailey died
a few months later in  all england
rroumed his passing then stood by breath-
lessly for a fifteen-year vigil wondering
whether haileys comet would make its pre-
dicted return

  the years went by swiftly at last-
alexis clairaut now world-famous for his
mathematical researches threw aside his
telescope rubbed his burning eyes

  well monsieur clairaut where is your
professor haileys comet came the mock-
ing exclamation of a rival scientist dalem-
bert you have searched the skies for two
weeks now yet there is no sign of this
comet but do not worry mon ami per-
haps if we will wait another seventy-six
years monsieur haileys comet will come
again he laughed sarcastically maybe

  clairaut was quick to defend haileys
prophecy monsieur dalembert he
snapped irritably professor haileys cal-
culations are correct i have studied his
papers gone over them a thousand times
why the comet of  even appeared in
 in william the conquerors time it is
pictured in the bayeux tapestry the comet
will appear-just as professor hailey pre-
dicted

  bah you are stupid to follow the teach-
ings of hailey this fool-he could not
even predict the weather

 and so it went the astronomers of
clairauts day scoffed at haileys prediction
ridiculed clairaut for his faith in the proph-
ecy but clairaut was adamant the mem-
ory of his meeting with the aged hailey was
something time would never erase he could
never forget how intensely sincere the old
man had been how penetrating his logic

but there was something wrong somewhere
what was it in the name of the gods

  clairaut buried himself in mathematical
research finally he had it certain dis-
turbances of the planets in the path of the
comet had delayed its course clairauts fig-
ures showed that the comet woubd return
   but two years later hailey could hardly
be blamed for not anticipating these delicate
factors

  in march  alexis clairaut stood on
his rooftop staring triumphantly at the

hailey astronomer-royal to charles ii

celestial phenomenon that hung eerily over
the land it was a phenomenon unmatched
for grandeur except perhaps by an eclipse of
the sun the long shimmering tail which
streamed from an incandescent head many
times brighter than the most scintillant star
in the heavens seemed to be unwinding from
some cosmic spool below the earth

  here was haileys comet a little late
yes but the important thing was that its
return to earth had been predicted clairaut
was happy he stayed up all night watching
the flight of the comet but he didnt see it
so well its hard to see well-through tears

the number of stars

 editor science question box

   i have read somewhere that astronomers
 system to be about  in number
 milwaukee wisconsin

  nobody can count the stars in the galaxy
because it is impossible even with our great-
est telescopes to see or photograph all of
them the problem must be attacked by in-
direct methods one of these is based on the
discovery that the sun one of the stars of
the system revolves around the galactic cen-
ter in an orbit of such gigantic size-
light-years in diameter-that  or
more years are required for a single revolu-
tion

compute the number of stars in our siderial
how was this number arrived at-e k

 with these data at hand it is possible by
 applying the law of universal gravitation to
 compute the total mass weight of the stars
 within the solar orbit astronomers have a
 pretty good idea of the average mass of the
 stars in the immediate neighborhood of the
 sun assuming that this average holds good
 throughout the galaxy it is then possible to
 arrive at a rough estimate of the total number
 of stars-ed

change in length of day

 editor science question box

 recently newspapers reported a statement from the smithsonian institution which
 announced that the length of the day is very slowly changing because the friction caused
 by the tides is slowing down the earth can you be good enough to explain to me how
 the difference in the length of the day is noted-b e l phil pa

in this way a total eclipse occurs elsewhere

 our knowledge of the change in the length
 of the day depends almost entirely on the
 study of ancient eclipses of the sun by the
 moon the occurrence of these eclipses is not
 the same as calculation shows it should be if
 the revolving earth had maintained its rate
 the earth moves so fast on ita axis that if the
 moon is not at the appointed place at the
 given moment the earth can slip around an
 appreciable amount before the meeting with
 the sun occurs

 than in the place predicted the same thing
 occurs if the earth has been going round more
 slowly than has been calculated

   several scientists have examined these old
 records the question is not a simple one
 chiefly because the historians who wrote them
 were not expert in observing the phenomena
 or in gathering the particular kind of infor-
 mation that is needed by the astronomer-ed

 you frequently hear of these mental wizards-people who are supposed to be so gifted

 we know how high up man has ascended but how deep has he delved into the earth
 what is the worlds record-o o b chicago 

  the deepest hole in the earth is an oil well
recently completed in the san joaquin valley
about four miles west of wasco calif it
penetrated the earths crust to a depth of
 feet-almost three miles

  temperature readings taken under ex-
tremely difficult conditions indicated tem-
peratures ranging from  degrees p at 

ft to  degrees at  ft or  degree in-
crease for every  ft the similarity of
temperatures in the lower horizons to those
in other wells at shallower depths suggests
the possibility that the distance of a given
point above the basement rocks has more
bearing on its temperature than its distance
below the earths surface-ed

earths speed changes and the result is-

the lost hour

by alexander samalman

author of the changer of i

one day in march  earths
scientists discovered that the
world had lost one hour o

time

  beneath the globes surface a mol-
ten mass of matter which for a cen-
tury had bubbled and boiled as if
stirred by the fires of hell subsided
in its mad upward surge

  concurrently fissures on the crust
of the earth closed there was a
change in the eternal rhythm of
earths contraction and expansion
and a consequent lowering of its sur-
face

  local disturbances were reported
however as the severest shocks were
felt at the north and south poles
and under the atlantic and pacific
oceans no general cataclysm took
place

  the occurrence was the subject of
a lengthy statement by professor al-
dous grant world-renowned physi-
cist professor grant was quoted as
follows in the daily record for
march  

  the phenomena which we are wit-
nessing are not unfamiliar to scien-
tists although they have never been
as marked as at present because of

      the last straw etc

internal disturbances our spheres
rate of rotation or the length of the
terrestrial day is undergoing a
change

  as early as  astronomers no-
ticed certain irregularities in the mo-
tion of the moon these were inex-
plicable and in a strict sense are in-
explicable to the present day

  irregularities in the motion of the
sun were also observed checking
these against the irregularities of the
moon it was discovered that they co-
incided this left no alternative
other than the assumption that the
true change is in the speed of the
earth and not in the speed of either
sun or moon at various times in the
past notably in  in  in 
and in  the earths speed was
subjected to sudden changes

  these changes have been attrib-
uted to contraction and expansion of
the earths crust due to altered tem-
peratures within the molten layers
in the nineteenth century the effect
of these erratic pulsations was the
lengthening of the year by one second
in  it was observed that an oppo-
site effect was obtained the apparent
length of the year becoming shorter
by almost a full minute

  the present disturbances how-
ever bid fair to break all records we
have been losing time at an unbeliev-
ably swift rate nothing has as yet
been done to adjust ourselves to
this acceleration nevertheless it is
doubtful whether-



in a dark prison cell a man was pre-
paring to die praying fervently
he sought to make peace with his god

  ralph frazier knew he was inno-
cent but the circumstantial evidence
of the case was all against him and
so he had to die

the sentence was definite left no
the lost hour



room for doubt he was in a strange
land and thus far nobody had come
to his defense

  the words echoed in his tortured
mind	

  to be hung by the neck until dead
on the morning of march   at
or before five oclock-

  it was shortly before the fatal hour
when they called for ralph frazier
and marched him into the prison
yard he looked up at the sky for
what he thought would be the last
time-and suddenly he gasped the
sun was high in the heavens

  look padre he said to the dig-
nified figure at his side it is past
dawn

  the guards gaped their astonish-
ment in the prison yard stood an an-
cient sundial ralph frazier pointed
to it it is six oclock according to
that sundial over there he declared

  it was true although every clock
in the vicinity proclaimed the hour
of five the evidence of the sundial
could not be denied

  our clocks must be out of gear
said the warden but it makes no
difference lets go ahead

  ah no spoke the padre the
young man must not be executed for
god has wrought a miracle on his be-
half you must grant him the privilege
of a re-trial according to the laws of
this community

  benevolently the padre patted
ralph fraziers head

  my son he said thank the lord
for this precious chance that has come
to you to prove your innocence
ralph frazier was conducted back
to his cell where he flung himself
upon the stone floor and wept in
prayer and gratitude   

	  

dr james hoskins was
 roused from his sleep by the in-
sistent ringing of the telephone he
looked out of the window and saw
that it was dawn

  the voice over the wire was anxious
and grief-stricken

  we waited until day came the
mother spoke nervously but the
babys condition hasnt improved he

suffered all night and is very feverish
now oh doctor we dont know what
to do and if you can hurry-

  it meant a long trip across ex-
tremely bad roads in the heart of the
woods dr hoskins sighed as he
dressed life wasnt easy

  when he arrived at the babys bed-
side he took one look at the flushed
face of the tossing infant and rolled
up his sleeves and set to work

  hell pull through all right he
said comfortingly but if youd
waited another ten minutes before
calling me it would have been too
late



the dictator of a large empire was
giving his final instructions to his
espionage chief

  you hold the fate of esthinia in
your hands he said gravely my
people there are ready to overthrow
the government-but they need your
guidance your presence would elec-
trify them spur them into action
but i cant reach esthinia said
the spy not if as you say the mis-
sion is so secret that i cant use a
plane the route is heavily guarded
and theres a price on my head in the
intervening territory

  under cover of night you can
work your way through the dictator
advised i order you to go now-
and you will be there in time    you
must not use a conveyance of any kind
for your preparations would be ob-
served and theres no one i can trust
this is of the utmost importance
as he made his way through forest
and field in the darkness the spy re-
alized the vast significance of his mis-
sion once he presented himself in
esthinia the spark would be put to
the powder keg revolution would
flame there would be war and con-
quest glory and widespread disaster
but-the esthinians would not act
without him

  the dictator wanted revolt-it
would establish him as the ruler the
man of destiny over a much larger em-
pire than he now controlled

  if however the spy were stopped
before reaching his destination the
threatened uprising would peter out


startling stories

  nearer and nearer he came to the
border

  the darkness and his own clever-
ness in avoiding detection were serv-
ing him well

 suddenly he looked up and was
startled out of his wits had the night
passed so quickly the fingers of
dawn were beginning to paint the
sky----

 now the spy became frantic
hastened toward his goal it was a
mad fight against time scratched and
bruised he tried to run through
bramble and bush futilely pounded
against obstructing trees

  it was no use lighter and lighter
it grew and he could no longer hide
himself while traveling if only he
had another hours time he crouched
under the outspread branches of a pro-
tective tree and it was then a sentry
saw and recognized him

  as he was led away to a place of
detention the spy trembled at the
thought of the dictators mighty
wrath

  today was the day to strike-and
he had failed and another dream of
world domination was shattered


  -doubtful whether the report of

the learned professor grant went on
the current acceleration of the
earth will have any noticeable influ-
ence on the earths population per-
haps the majority of individuals will
be completely unaware of what has
happened only the most astute will
understand the cosmic occurrence-
-and even they will be at a loss to
explain the amazingly swift terrific
contraction and consequent accelera-
tion of the earth

  i predict that though we shall have
lost an entire hour by tomorrow
march eleventh life will go on in
much the same way and people will
devote their energies to quite the
usual pursuits granted of course
that present calculations are not upset
by unforeseen eruptions

 though of immense significance
from a scientific viewpoint this
phenomenon will pass almost utterly
unmarked by and of no importance
whatever to the hurrying and scurry-
ing beings who make up the major
population of this globe they will
soon become accustomed to the
changed time cycle and after official
action is taken will accept it with the
same nonchalance with which they ac-
cept daylight saving schedules

binders best
by thomas s gardner

  the second issue of startling stories
fully bears out the policy of good stories laid
down bythe memorable first

  the impossible world is the best story
binder ever wrote it is well planned and
written please pass on to him my congratu-
lations his characterization is swell and i
have few objections i cannot agree with his
science in regard to planetary conditions on
jupiter nor for the possibility of one sub-
stance acting as a universal hormone-al-
though the idea is unique and i believe orig-
inal and an excellent story point his chief

scientist acted like a spoiled child-and by
gosh many scientists i know do too it is
about time the scientist is taken down from
his pedestal of either a crank or austere
super-being go to it

  hamiltons fear neutralizer was olt
hamilton always writes well turnabout

departments wero very good especially
thrills in science i had never heard
the story concerning copernicus the human
interest in this department will do more to
develop a genuine interest in science and sci-
entists as human beings than many books
would i hope the succeeding issues are as
well written and edited as this one- john

finlay magnificent
by harry warner jr

  we could hardly expect the standard of the
second issue of startling stories to come
up to that of the first but nevertheless it
came close to it the impossible world
was about the finest thing that binder has
ever written in my opinion the idea on
the whole was good though not completely
original and the narrative style was superb

  it only goes to bring out my old theory that
any author can do better on long novels than
with shorts and novelets whatever you do
dont stop printing the full-length novel each
time-and keep it long at least eighty pages

  the reprint was again well chosen i
havent any nominations to make for the
hall of fame but i would like to second
several nominations in the second issue par-
ticularly weinbaums martian odyssey
mannings seeds from space and the sub-
lime vigil by cuthbert ive read all three
but i would like to see them again and
by all means put weinbaums bust in the cut

future vs present
by george v calvert

  the black flame and the impossible
world were hoth fine rtorien of the future
stories of the future are interesting but i
think too many are now being written there-
fore i would like to see a few novels of the
present

  weinbaums the new adam and any of
taines unpublished novels would make good
material for future issues your policy of
reprinting the classics is fine and i would like
to see some of the stories that were very
popular in the past once more

 the scientific crossword puzzle
is entertaining and i would like to see that
feature continued

  in conclusion startling stories is the
best of the new science fiction magazines and
i hope that it will continue to appear al-
though it is of little importance i would like
to see s s come out in large format- v

the feature story was not of course and could
not have been expected to be equal to wein-

weinbaum brilliant
by charles b hidley

  the black flame by stanley g weln-
baum was one of the most beautiful char-
acter studies i have ever read in action or
non-flrtlnn it was truly wonderful and you
are to be congratulated for publishing it in
such an artistic manner with the interesting
illustrations by wesso what could possibly
be more perfect action science beauty
love hate and endless other human emotions
combined with that inimitable weinbaum
style that was so great justly title it as the
best scientifictlon novel ever written by all
means let us see dawn of name

  the hall of fame is a clever ard long
sought-after idea science island was well
written and exciting mr binder is indeed
fortunate to he able to stand next to wein-
baum and still be recognized through the
aura of brilliance bravo mr binder

  the profuse features join to make the whole
issue a stupendous success-and for a flrst
issue too t have only one adjective left-
it really is amazing i only hope you con-
tinue the good work

perfect line-up
by henry boernstein

  of course its too soon to tell but t believe
that with your flrst issue you have surpassed
every other scientlfiction mag on the mar-
ket and this in spite of the fact that the
january issue didnt contain my favorite type
of story-the interplanetary novel however
i see you are going to make up for that in the
next issue

  weinbaum was always my favorite author
and he certainly didnt disappoint me with
the black flame here for the flrst time
he had a chance to expand and encompass
many little twists in the plot never have 
read a story with that interesting variation
to it-the fact that the hero does make mis-
takes doesnt marry the flrst girl that enters
the story-and best of all is no superman
it is hard to criticize this story there being
nothing to criticize ah  could have sug-

jested was a sequel a pleasure which is un-
ortunately impossible

  stick to your policy of one long novel and
two or three short stories it not only lends
itself to originality but it enables you to pub-
lish really worthwhile classics brevity may
be the soul of wit but certainly not of scl-
entifictlon

  i onjoy stories that transport the reader to
a distant planet among steamy vegetation and
weird forms of life into an environment to-
tally alien and mysterious in which u space-
suited figure wanders about exploring and
uncovering evidence of a race for in advance

of our own a fantasy in short of what will
inevitably come when humans conquer the
uncharted vastness of space and editor if
it is at all possible obtain and reprint that
story which so many of us have missed-
the moon pool

  now as to the features of the new maga-
zine  gaze bewildered at the almost perfect
line-up all the features i ever hoped to see
hie here particularly the hall of fame
the tribute to weinbaum the guest editor-
ial and the science fiction fan publications
review there is an inexpressible pleasure in
communicating with such organizations and
exchanging views

  here are some suggested-nay demanded

the weinbaum spell
by langley searles

  startling stories enters the sclentiflc-
tion field in great fashion it was even a bet-
ter issue than i had hoped for the cover
wasnt bad looking and the lettering of the
title was pleasingly modernistic ditto for
the lettering on the back binding-a years
row of them should present a good appear-
ance on any bookshelf

  the cuts used for the various department
headings have a neat up-to-the-minute look
which i like a praiseworthy idea reviewing
fan publications keep this up jack binders
feature is as always good the crossword
puzzle brought back memories of several
years ago when as a high school geometry
student i completed a x one using geo-
metrical terms exclusively it was some job

  now to the stories science island was a
typical pot-boller the black flame-first
last and foremost was excellent same for
the illustrations someone back in  said
in effect that welnbatlms stories make you
sorry as hell to wake up never mr editor
have truer words been penned

  ive read the novel twice already and ill
read it many times again as ihave all his
works it was superbly written not u sin
gle paragraph or sentence was boresome or
dull as otto binder said its very simplicity
is misleading no one but weinbaum could
turn mere words into such a atory with such
artistic deftness

  the black flame was successful for the
same reason that all his others were wein-
baum remained within the circle that he drew
with the result that the circle becomes as
wide as the universe and as limitless as the
horizon and its spell lingers on after youve
laid it down just as its authors name lingers

immortal story

by jack darrow

    book-length science fiction novels complete
 in one issue-its good to have that again
 reminds one of the old quarterlies the
 black flame by weinbaum is one of those
 atorles i hated to see end i was just con-
 tent to read on and on the end had to come
 though and i am thankful that it was a
 happy one an immortal story

    the book-length novel is the main event in
 startling stories it should havo been
 given the cover there are any number of
 scenes from the black flame that would
 have made good cover scenes the one tn
 which a messenger catches up with tom
 connor is one-given a half page drawing by
 wesso with the city of urbs as a background

   the various departments are interesting
 thrills in science is very entertainingly
 written there are  pages of non-flction in
 the jan issue why not eliminate science
 question box retaining all the other fea-
 tures and use the space instead for fiction
 a few extra pages of illustrations for the
 novel perhaps im looking forward expect-

flame literature

   i think startling stories is a grand
 idea and you certainly have had an auspicious
 send-off the black flame was as great
 a novel as i havo ever read the intricate
 interweaving of the plot the various conflicts
 and cross-pulls throughout make it first-

longs for the long novels

startling stories



can say is that they dont come too long for
me if each issue contained just one long
story of about  pages id be lost to the
world for quite a while im afraid

  remind your authors that a good sclentlflc-
tion story does not need the addition of sen-
timental love interest or strange and improb-
able menaces that are casting hungry glances
at the earth humanity and everything else
in sight witness your reprint of the eter-

ample of a well-balanced story- e slau-

binders okay

  i have just finished the flrst issue of
startling stories and for me it satisfies
a long-felt want-that of enjoying long stor-
ies or novels of science action

  i note that the next issue has a long novel
by eando binder which should make it an-
other top-notch issue while i have never
road any long novel by the binders i have
been reading their short stories for several
years and it seems to me that they are im-
proving all the time

  i am not a scientist but an accountant and
auditor i do not care whether a story has
all the very latest scientific ideas or theories
but i like it to be interesting in the human
reactions and true to life also to the prob-
able under the circumstances and conditions
laid down by the author or at the very least
possible and the human reaction with which
we are all more or less familiar natural-

quade  carlyle-r
by sam simpson

  orchids to you for startling stories
the black flame was just the type of story
i like but hereafter i suggest that your
cover illustration should illustrate the feature
and not one of the short stories

  binders science island was just fair and
the eternal man failed to click with me
however the hall of fame lias great
possibilities

  mark me down for a vote for a book-length
novel of anthony quade and gerry carlyle
it should be the berries if possible i wish
that you could get burroughs to contribute
a manuscript to your magazine otis adel-
bert kline should produce a swell novel for
you too dont pass him up you could pass
up penton and blake and never get a single
howl from yours truly ive seen too much
of those birds in tws

  i have yet to read welnbaums a martian
odyssey and so of course i would like to
see it in the hall of fame i am only fif-
teen years old so you can see that i didnt
get a chance to read the story when it was
originally published several years ago in
closing i would like to wish your magatine
much popularity and a long life-front

meet the author

              yes said hamilton stroking
j his pet tiger-cub ive had quite a
thrilling life i believe ray most
exciting experience was when i climbed
mount everest just after my deep-sea div-
ing expedition and before i became a gen-
eral in the chinese army

  well thats the kind of autobiography id
like to write but honesty compels me to
admit sadly that i am just an average sort
of person

  bom  years ago and lived ever since in
a small pennsylvania city high school and
then college where i majored in physics and
drove my instructors crazy by continually
propounding original scientific theories of
my own

  took a job in a railroad office and then
my passion for science fiction drove me to
try writing a story it sold and that started
me on my career of crime

  im unmarried and like to gad about the
country get out to new mexico to visit
jack williamson nearly every year and he

returns the visit
every two or three
my other favorite
spots are new or-
leans san fran-
cisco quebec and
fort madison
iowa one place i
dont like much is
mexico but for
some queer reason
ive been down
there three times in
the last four years

  never had but
two adventures of
the hair-breadth
type and they
both fizzled once
in a rowboat on the lower mississippi i was
nearly pulled under a barge-but a swearing
barge-hand slung a rope and hauled me ig-
nominiously to safety other time was
when i upset myself and companions in a
sailboat off the florida shore-and then dis-
covered the water was so shallow we could
almost walk home

   ive done close to two hundred stories in-
cluding a good many detective and mystery
tales a book of my fantastic stories was
published in england a year or so ago two
or three stories have been reprinted in an-
thologies

  because ive been a science fiction fan
ever since i was twelve writing such stories
seems to me the most fascinating occupation
in the world i get a big thrill out of evepr
story i do i only hope a little of that thrill
gets across to the reader
