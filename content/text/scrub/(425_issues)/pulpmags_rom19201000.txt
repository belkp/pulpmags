 write for my free booklet ask for the names and ad-
 dresses of accomplished players of piano or organ near you
 who obtained their entire training from me by mail 
 have students in all parts of the world and scores in every
 state in the union

 although my wav of teaching piano was laughed at when i first started
 in  yet i now have far more students than were ever before
 taught by one nan could i have fought my way up against prejudice
 like this year after year for over a quarter of a century unless my
 method possessed real merit investigate is all i ask

   ill teach you piano in quarter the usual time and at quarter
                       the usual cost if you have not previously heard of my method
                       this may seem like a pretty bold statement
                       but i will soon prove to you that it is not
                       in any way exaggerated if youll simply
                       send me your name and address on the

   my way of teaching piano or organ is
 entirely different from all others out of
 every four hours of study one hour is
 spent entirely away from the keyboard-
 learning something about harmony and
 the laws of music this is an awful
 shock to most teachers of the old
 school who still think that learning
 piano is solely a problem of finger gym-
 nastics when you do go to the key-
 board you accomplish twice as much
 because you understand what you are
 doing studying this way is a pleasure
 within four lessons i enable you to play
 an interesting piece not only in the original
 key but in all other keys as well

 working for us

   i bought another good bond todav and tonight helen and i were figuring up our invest-
 ments we now have  altogether saved and invested where it will bring us  a
 month interest year in and year out theres a wonderful satisfaction in having money
 youve worked for working for you

    i used lo laugh at the idea of my ever having that much money invested i was just scraping along in routine
 work and spending what little i earned then one day my employer cave me some advice that really marked
 the beginning of things forme he said success depended on two things first learn to do some one thine
 well o well that others will pay you for what you know second save and invest something out of what you
 earn each month

    i was out of school and couldnt go back but i decided then and there to get some special training i wrote
 to scranton and found  could eet just the course i wanted and study at home evenines so i started and it
 wasnt lone before i could see a whole new futurein ourbusiness the manager found i could do things others
 couldnt and he gave me more important work-and
 i kept on studying and kept on climbing

more money 		 

 with three increases the first year and each pay day
 i put something aside

    so its been ever since as i advanced at the office
 and my salary grew my savings grew faster and  put
 them into good securities its really amazing what a
 few years of consistent saving will do

   since helen and i have been married weve had
 every comfort we could want and yet she has been as
 interested in saving as i why she was happy as a lark
 tonight when  told her we had five thousand dollars in
 safe sound investments working for us

   success is not something remote-its not something
 that only the other fellow can enjoy it is within easy
 reach for you if youll just follow the simple rules that
 have made all men successful who have practiced them

    first decide what your work is the work you would
 most enjoy doing then studv it learn everything about
 it that you can the easy convenient way to do this is
 to let the international correspondence schools help
 you for  years they have been helping men and
 women out of routine drudgery into the joy of doing
 work they like-helping them to win advancement to
 earn more money to have happy prosperous homes to
 know the thrill of getting ahead in business and in life

   more than two million have taken the up road with
 ic s help more than  are now turning their
 spare time to profit hundreds are starting every day

jimsie of kilmack

by nell hanson

norah byrne bent her head as
she stepped through the cabin door
into the sunlit street drawing her
shawl more closely round her as
she did so for the april winds were chilly
on that western seacoast she had barely
gone twenty paces when three or four
young men separated themselves from the
various groups lounging round the cabin
doors in sunday idleness and joined her

for norah was the beauty of the village
and always had her following of lads whom
she treated with exasperating impartiality
sending some moonstruck youth up to the
seventh heaven of delight one day and the
next bestowing her favors on his most hated
rival today timothy burke was in high
favor walking on air for he had been into
ennis for a week and there had learned
the waltz-a dance unknown in kilmack in
those days-and had been teaching it to
norah byrne

and now it transpired that jimsie brien
the hunchback fiddler had somewhere
learned the tune of one listening outside
the windows of the honorable mr frenchs
house no doubt and norah and timothy
were to dance together at the cross-roads
today while the whole of the village looked
on

there would be many envious looks cast
upon the pair for norah was graceful and
supple as a young willow and her dancing
was the pride of the whole countryside
while timothy burke was the handsomest
lad in the village and the cause of many a
heartache in many a maidens breast

the crowd had already assembled when
they reached the cross-roads and the men
and girls were busily engaged in a jig
the girls dancing with downcast eyes
scarcely raising them to their partners
faces their feet twinkling through the in-
tricate steps dancing as if this were part of
the most serious business in life

the music stopped suddenly as norah
appeared and men and girls cleared off to

i
nell h an so n

the sides of the road clapping of hands and

cries of

   the waltz norah lets have the
waltz proclaiming their interest in what
was to come

  jimsie brien raised his fiddle tucked it
under his chin and with a soft caressing
movement his eyes fixed steadily on the
ground began to play norah threw off
her shawl and with head held a little
higher than usual and heightened color
for-she was fully conscious of the admir-
ing eyes fixed upon her-she advanced to
meet her handsome partner and the dance
began

  timothys arm encircled her waist and
timothys ardent gaze never left her face
as they circled round and round to the
swaying dreamy music but norahs
glance darted hither and thither noting
the envious glancesvf the girls and the un-
concealed admiration of the men and her
heart beat quickly with excitement only
jimsie brien fiddled on and never raised
his eyes to look at her

  a strange feeling of irritation took pos-
session of norah because a man was
hunchbacked was he therefore insensible
to youth and grace and loveliness

  he shall look at me she said to her-
self and a little pucker of vexation showed
itself between her brows as she passed his
bent head

  play slower jimsie she said softly as
they passed and jimsie played more
slowly but did not raise his head

  the music stopped the waltz was over
cries of dance it again norah darlin
came from all sides but norah shook her
head smiling with the discernment of
the true artist and coquette she realized
that that which is not given too easily is
best appreciated

  the applause continued suddenly the
girl turned on her heel and crossing the
open space toward timsies corner

  ill dance ye a reel by meself she
said will you play for me jimsie she
asked coaxingly bending toward the little
man

  jimsie nodded his head and slowly raised
his fiddle to his chin but still he did not
look at her

  with a scarcely perceptible shrug norah
walked out into the open space and stand-
ing in full view of the fiddler she began to
dance faster faster twinkled her feet

her color grew brighter her heart beat
quickly and a little gleam of excitement
shone in her dark blue eyes as she danced
keeping her gaze riveted on the hunch-
backs head

  jimsie she called at last yere
playin too fast ye must watch me or
ye cant tell the shpeed to be playin

  jimsie played more slowly but did not
raise his eyes

  its that slow now she called imperi-
ously ye must look at me jimsie or i
cant dance at all

  slowly the hunchback raised his head
and his large dark eyes full of that suffer-
ing mental and physical that had been
his from babyhood met norahs laughing
blue ones for a long moment he looked at
her-neither of them could have counted
the time in seconds-while his fingers
played mechanically and norahs shapely
feet kept time to the music her color
faded her breath came ir little gasps and
a frightened look stole into her eyes

  the music stopped suddenly with a jar-
ring discord jimsie rose from his seat with
a little shudder and tucking his violin
under his arm he walked away leaving
norah staring after him heedless of every-
thing round her

  the indignant protests of the crowd
roused her

  och jimsie come back ye spalpeen
ye promised yed play for us

  but he only shookhis head and plodded
on down the road that led to the sea

  dye think is he mad because ye said
he wasnt playin right some one asked
norah

  the girl shook her head and walked over
to timothy burke

  take me home timmy she whispered
im not wanting to dance any more

the sun was sinking making a blaze of
color in the sky that was reflected in
the gleaming bog-pools below him as jim-
sie brien climbed the liny hill that led to
the fairy fort reaching the grassy cir-
cular mound built probably by some chief
of ancient time though the country-people
prefer to think the little people the archi-
tects jimsie seated himself against the side
that faced the sea on his right was a low
clump of stunted bushes while all round
stretched flat fields with low hedges and
bogland no large trees of any kind could

 stand the winter gales on that clare coast

   hello jimsie youre late tonight a
 fresh young voice greeted him as a boy
 about twelve years old appeared from in-
 side the fort

   am i that master alec jimsie asked

   indeed you are do hurry up and play
for me or ill have to go home itll soon
be supper-time

   jimsie sat for some time gazing out to
 sea watching the changing colors of the
 sky reflected in purple and flame and
 orange in a strangely calm sea and then
 he began to play the boy had flung him-
 self face downward on the grass and
 listened spellbound as the music climbed to
 heights of joy ineffable making him long
 to cry out with the very gladness of being
 alive and sinking suddenly to depths of
 pain and despair such as he could not even
 dimly understand but which wrung his
 musical young heart almost beyond bear-
 ing and then the sound would soar away
 again to that almost unearthly paradise of
 joy-

   the playing ended suddenly with a wild
 fierce sound like the cry of some animal
 mortally wounded in the chase and jimsie
 sat tense and still the shadow of pain and
 hunger in his deep gray eyes

   tell me what its about jimsie asked
 the boy after a long silence jimsie did not
 answer

   please please tell me i cant under-
 stand pleaded the boy with the tactless
 persistence of youth

   after a little jimsie answered him he
 spoke in a low musical voice his eyes fixed
 on the far horizon

   its about a gurl a beautiful gurl the
 most beautiful gurl in all kilmack an in
 the whole wurrld shes tall an graceful
 as the reeds that grow in the bog yonder
 an sway in the wind when it blows an
 her eyes are the sky of a summer night
 with the gay stars twinkling in the deep
 blue so far away that ye can not come near
 them at all forever an her hair is the red-
 brown leaves in the woods in autumn an
 round her the fairies dance in a circle al-
 ways he went on dreamily drawing the
 mystic circle with the bow of his violin

   they dance there always and always
wishin her joy and the beauty of the whole
wurrld an the love of a great prince an
kapin out annything that is sad an ugly
an crooked an thats why i never can

 come near her at all he said drawing in
 his breath with a shuddering sigh

  youre not ugly jimsie alec frenchs
indignant young voice broke in on his sad
spoken thoughts mother says that no
one who is good and kind can be ugly and
you are the kindest man in all kilmack
the children all love you best i know
jimsie shook his head mournfully

   its not the love of the child thatll sat-
isfy a mans heart masther alec its a
woman with her sthrong white arrums
about him holding him close to her breast
an lookin- deep in his eyes an croonin
love-words softly thatll satisfy a mans
heart an itll never be mine avick

  alec watched the red sun now a slowly
disappearing ball on the horizon

  they say if you wish when the last bit
of sun disappears youll get your wish
he said

   its not thrue master alec ive tried
it these many nights

  i must be off to supper said the boy
rising reluctantly poor old jimsie
never mind he said awkwardly noting
the pathetic lines of the hunchbacks face
and stooping he gave him a rough shame-
faced schoolboy peck on his pale cheek
then swung away down the hill to his wait-
ing schoolroom supper

when he had gone jimsie raised his
violin and the rich full tones rising
now and then to a fierce harshness that was
almost discord despairing and sinking once
more to exquisite tenderness floated out
over the bogland so absorbed was he in
the vision he interpreted that he did not
notice a man and a girl who crossed the
bogland and presently climbing the little
hill sat down not far from the fort

  whisht timmy whispered norah i
want to hear jimsie play

   och why couldnt he be playin for the
dancin today the way ye asked him
whispered timothy irritably

   the girl bit her lip and hot tears rose in
her eyes as she turned her head and gazed
seaward it was may and the brilliant
sunset coloring was slowly changing to the
turquoise and gentle primrose of an early
summer twilight

  four times in the last month she had
gone to jimsie and begged him to play
again for the dancing and each time he had
refused her curtly turning on his heel and

slouching away and a curious little pain
for which she could find no name had crept
about her heart and would not be stilled
though she laughed with the gayest and
footed it lightly to another fiddlers playing

  jimsie played on unheeding and
timothy sat in restless silence beside -the
listening girl but the music wrought on
his emotions and he could be silent no
longer

  och norali will ye listen he broke
out at last doant ye know why i got ye
to come a walk with me darlin

  but norah turned on him quickly

  whisht i tell ye she whispered cov-
ering his mouth with her little brown hand

  but it was too late the music had
stopped suddenly and jimsie had risen and
was making off down the hill

  jimsie come back and play

  there was entreaty in the girls voice
but jimsie did not even turn his head

  why wud ye be listenin to thon old
music norah darlin when its meself is
longin to hold ye in me warrum arrums
and tell ye how i love ye dear said
timothy as his arm stole round the girl 

  but norah sat still as a stone

  ive two cows darlin an the hens and
chickens an a good job at the hall beside
yell want for nothing as long as i live he
said

  but norah slowly determinedly shook
her head

  i couldnt marry ye timmy not if yed
ten cows an ten pigs an all the chickens
in kilmack

  norah ye dont love me then

  i love no wan an ill marry no wan
ever said the girl with set face and all
the note of finality in her voice

  timothy rose unsteadily to his feet

  dye mane that norah darlin he
asked looking yearningly down at the still
face

  yes i mane it

  then suddenly the set face relaxed and
hot tears rose in her eyes

  och timmy im sorry i cant help
meself she cried stretching out her arms
to him helplessly

  doant ye worrit yerself darlin he
said gently turning away

  walking to a low stone dike that bor-
dered the bogland he sat down vainly try-
ing to shape for himself a new world in
which dwell no norah by and by he came

rom

back to her and norah watched him com-
ing deep pity in her dark blue eyes

  itll be aisiest to go to ameriky darlin
doant fret ill be all right an maybe
yell change some day he declared
bravely

  good-by for now ill get home by me-
self i think he said as he crossed the
little stone dike that led to the path
through the bog

  norah could only watch him dumbly
for tears of pity and of strange loneliness
choked her a long time she sat there
while before her eyes rose the vision that
was with her night and day now do what
she would the image of a little stunted
man misshapen with bent head

  and all at once the image would raise its
head and she would see a pale face sensi-
tive delicate with gray eyes lustrous im-
measurably sad that held hers and seemed
to draw her whole soul into their depths

  by and by she crossed the turf to
jimsies seat and lying face downward
there her face pressed against the green
cool grass she sobbed as if her heart would
break after a while she rose and gave
herself a little impatient shake

  bah its a fool-i am to be sure she
laughed harshly and holding her head a
little more proudly than usual she went her
way down to the cross-roads dancing

august had come and here and there
across the countryside little patches
of yellow were showing where the farmers
small fields of grain were beginning to
ripen high in the blue sky the larks
poured forth their song of joy and night
after night toward the set of sun jimsie
brien climbed the little hill to the fairy
fort and played his strange melodies of
joy and pain

  and many a night norah byrne mount-
ing the hill before him would hide herself
in the little wind-tossed clump of bushes
near the fort since the night when
timothy had asked her to marry him
jimsie had come alone for alec french had
been carried off to dublin and no one else
cared to hear him play on this august
night however jimsie had hardly seated
himself when alecs clear voice hailed him
coming up the hill

  its glad i am to see ye masther alec
said the hunchback ive missed ye
sorely
jimsie of

  me too said the boy earnestly and
they chatted together while jimsie told
the boy of his brother who had gone to be
a soldier

  an if it wasnt for this ould hunch of
mine its a soldyer id be meself he said
for me hearts there an they do say
that before i had the fall that put me
crooked me an me brother were the dead
shpit of wan another he finished wistfully

  well youre a brave man anyway de-
clared the boy i heard that when the
fever was here in june you were in and out
to every one and never a bit afraid

  jimsie shook his head

  maybe id be glad to have taken it
it wasnt very brave he said

  down in the little clump of trees great
tears of pity stood in norahs eyes

  play for me alec suddenly com-
manded

  jimsie drew his bow and began a rollick-
ing jig but the boy put out his hand and
stopped him

  no no he said play me about the
beautiful girl you love

  cramped close in the little clump of
bushes a fierce pain caught at norahs
heart and she shivered as with cold

  tell me about her again first i forget
it all except that she had red-brown hair
like the leaves in the autumn forest

   yes an shes the most beautiful gurl in
the whole of kilmack an in the whole
wurrld an her eyes are the blue of the
sky on a summer night with the stars shin-
ing but sometimes lately they are gray
and dark like a storm-sky

   and shes tall and slender like the bog-

kilmack	

reeds that sway in the wind i remember
shouted the boy and round her the
fairies dance in a circle always he went
on excitedly clapping his hands go on
jimsie i forget the rest

   round her the fairies dance in a circle
always went on the dreamy pathetic
voice wishin her joy an the beauty of
the whole wurrld an love an kapin out
all things that are sinful an ugly an mis-
shaped thats why i can never come near
her

   and so finishing he began to play while
close by in the clump of bushes norah
byrne strove -desperately to remember
whether in the whole of kilmack there was
any girl but herself who had red-brown hair
and eyes like a summer night

   and a queer little fluttering joy raised
its head and pushed its way up through
the misery in her heart

   supper-time came soon and alec trotted
down the hill leaving the fiddler alone a
long time he sat his knees drawn up before
him staring out at the changing sky and
the black shapes of the curraughs in the
bay where the fishermen hauled at their
heavy nets then with a long shuddering
cry he bent his poor misshapen back until
his pale face rested on his knees

   norah he cried once

  and then again piteously norah
byrne

  a second and the girl was beside him
but he did not heed her

   its me jimsie-norah she whispered
an im lovin ye this long long while
past she crooned as her strong young
arms stole round him drawing him close

whom the lord loveth

by ramsey benson

year after year for four year
blackstock sowed wheat anc
nothing but wheat and never oncc
did he get so much as his seed back
the long cool springs caused the grain tc
stool out till it covered the ground like z
carpet the short hot summers sent the
stalks shooting up to the height of a mans
shoulders and filled out the heads in a man-
ner to promise great things but in the fali
-it was the falls that played the mischief
some sort of storm perhaps only a trifling
flurry of wind in itself but enough to cleat
the air after that a crisp brilliant night
beautiful as lucifer and as wicked and the
wheat was gone

   frost year after year for four years
 not only blackstock but his neighbors as
 well the calamity fell upon the just and
 the unjust alike

   in that corner of saskatchewan you
 might plow over a thousand acres and never
 strike a rock as big as a pigeons egg you
 might dig fifty feet into the earth or drive
 a drill that deep and never encounter any-
 thing stiffer than clay

   but blackstock had a rock on his farm
 a massy bowlder of granite which the
 glacial drift had freakishly perched on the
 highest knoll he could stand on it and
 see every foot of his domain he climbed
 up there often to look out over his wheat
 billowing and bowing in the wind

   he never slept much the night of the
 frost he could foresee the calamity from
 the moment the sun went down so cruel-
 white and he rose from his restless bed a
 dozen times to scan the purple sky sown
 with stars that sparkled like points of
 flame with the first glimmer of morning
 he was out on the rock and there he stood
 like a figure cast in bronze and watched
 the day dawn the sun came up its touch
 turned the wheal black as ashes and when
 the breeze swept lightly over the field the
 stalks rattled like dry bones

   year after year for four years


w h o m the lord loveth

  once upon a lime he housed and fed
some chance wayfarers and was curiously
prompted for he was a man of few words
to tell them about his wheat they asked
him why he didnt try farming farther
south where the frosts held off longer but
blackstock shook his- head

  my ancestors lived in a bleak country
they might have gone farther south where
life was easier but they didnt they
tarried in the land the lord gave them and
he blessed them and made them a great
people he declaimed

  they could guess what people he meant
nevertheless they asked him

  scotch answered blackstock proudly

  his call was to preach it had been the
call of every blackstock for ten generations
-in scotland in ontario and now in sas-
katchewan they were a race of farmers
who thought out their sermons as with
their own hands they till the stubborn
glebe and they asked no pay for expound-
ing the word

  here the little neighborhood schoolhouse
was a church on sunday and in it black-
stock held forth he preached drearily
enough and at prodigious length but the
neighbors came and listened dutifully he
preached as his forefathers had preached
and they listened as their forefathers had
listened for they were scotch too

  if blackstock was ever touched with
pentecostal fire it was the sunday after
the frost the neighbors came with the
sense of the calamity strong upon them
they were poor folks ill-prepared to
weather such a storm there were debts
to pay and they hadnt the wherewithal to
pay them even they might run short of
food for themselves and their beasts a sad
and sober company

  blackstock invariably chose for his text
that day the verses from the twelfth chap-
ter of paul to the hebrews

  and ye have forgotten the exhortation which
speaketh unto you as unto children my son
despise not the chastening of the lord nor faint
when thou are rebuked of him

  for whom the lord loveth he chastcneth and
scourgeth every son whom he receiveth

  if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you
as with sons for what son is he whom the father
chasteneth not

  the burden of his discourse was in keep-
ing so far from bemoaning the calamity

he exulted in it and his voice was the voice
of a prophet unto his people they were
lifted up with him they came away awed
but lifted up as with the thunders of sinai
itself in their ears awed and solemnly
glad the lord loed them for he had
chastened them

   blackstocks little old wife sat silent and
listened with the rest he wras a kindly
man with her but silent and to hear him
speak out so was as wonderful and un-
wonted in her experience as in the neigh-
bors she drank in his words her faith
in him knew no limits

but the long lane turned at last the
fifth year was very much like the
others throughout the spring and summer
-that is everything a good year need be
blackstock stood on his rock and watched
the wheat grow big and beautiful the
harvest is late in that northern land and
august was well spent when the grain be-
gan to show yellow but it ripened fast
and there was no frost to cut it off

   everything favored in fact no frostsj
no rain to hinder the work only golden
harvest-weather the binders struck into
the fields and tossed off the sheaves with
scarcely an interval between-fat sheaves
that made a man stagger with the weight
of them

   golden sunshine day after day and right
behind the binders came the thresher swal-
lowing the sheaves as fast as four men
could pitch them into its greedy mouth and
gushing forth a stream of plump kernels
that was a very river of riches the ma-
chine had a contrivance that tripped as
often as a bushel came out and the sound
of its tripping was like the music of a gay
dance

   the yield ran better than fifty bushels
to the acre blackstocks farm of one hun-
dred sixty acres gave him about eight
thousand bushels and when he had hauled
it to market and sold it and out of the pro-
ceeds paid his debts there still lay a matter
of ten thousand dollars to his credit in the
bank a vast sum in his economy no
other blackstock ever had so much quite
likely his forefathers for ten generations
back had together earned no such sum be-
yond their living

  the bank was at epsom four miles
away blackstock came home with the cer-
ramsey benson

tificates of deposit and handed them to his
wife they were made out to her

  she took them in her hand uncertainly-
the hands which were eloquent testimony
to the poverty she had always known she
read the figures and looked up at black-
stock with a helpless air

  what shall we ever do with so much
she faltered

  thee has always wanted a paisley
shawl he answered weakly weak where
she had never seen him anything but
strong with decision gone from him to
whom she had always looked to decide

  from that moment in short he was a
different blackstock not only his wife
found him so but the neighbors as well he
moped from morning till night he spent
hours out on the rock regardless of the
weather neighbors saw him there in the
rain and shook their heads sadly he
didnt start his plows or lift a finger toward
the next years crop neighbors were
briskly and blithely busy turning the
stubble but blackstocks fields lay fallow

  nor did he preach the word went up
and down that there would be no preaching
at the schoolhouse and that was a sign
more disquieting than the others neigh-
bors whispered among themselves black-
stock was an old man he was breaking
he couldnt last forever

in these days there registered at the
epsom hotel in epsom a certain john
waldo finch he had come up into that
country to sell stock in oil wells in okla-
homa good crops bring a number of
things in their wake farmers so blessed
are themselves a harvest white for the sickle
and the laborers are never few like a
flock of hungry buzzards the tribe of agents
settled down on saskatchewan that year
with anything and everything to sell from
enlarged portraits to florida lands

  finch was smooth he didnt go about
in a lordy car neither did he wear a silk
hat and kid gloves he dressed and acted
and talked like a farmer he could tell
tales likely to interest farmers of ranchers
in nebraska who hogged down their corn
to save the cost of husking it and of cattle-
men in texas and arizona who found it
paid to build up their stock by turning
loose on the ranges thoroughbred sires cost-
ing as high as ten thousand dollars a head

  of course he was leading up to his own

purpose but he led them so adroitly that
when at length he opened out his maps and
began to talk business the neighbors were
prejudiced in his favor

  he represented the penguin leases the
penguin leases had taken over some thou-
sands of acres of land within sight of the
famous black panther well black panther
was an established name-it had been
much in the newspapers and though the
neighbors werent greatly given to reading
they already knew about the well and its
amazing record of production finch had
with him the reports of experts to the effect
that the geological formation under the
property of the penguin leases was fully
as promising as that from which the black
panther poured forth its fabulous riches

  finch wasnt lacking in originality
with homely eloquence he enlarged upon
the risks of farming that was a new
string and he harped upon it more than
any other

  just once in five years he pointed out
you have had a crop you dont know
when youll have another and now is your
chance to make your future secure by in-
vesting in good sound oil stock i will sell
you stock in the penguin leases for one
dollar a share in a few years perhaps
in a few months depending on the rapidity
of development it will be worth ten dollars
a share-or twenty dollars-or even one
hundred dollars-and all the while you will
be drawing dividends

  if you put your money back into your
farms youll throw- it away put it into
oil and it will be like bread cast upon the
waters mind you i dont deny that there
is money lost in oil but for every dollar
lost in oil theres ten dollars lost in farm-
ing-or more

  he was eloquent and adroit but the
neighbors were canny they were im-
pressed but not convinced they recom-
mended finch to see blackstock it was
a tradition of their race to put trust in the
man whom the lord had called to preach
to him they ascribed an insight beyond
their own if blackstock thought the in-
vestment good neighbors would be glad to
consider it further

  finch saw blackstock and the preacher
so far shook off his apathy as to concern
himself keenly with penguin leases when
finch spread out his maps blackstock re-
garded him and them intently and when
whom the lord lovet h

finch opened the flood-gates of his elo-
quence blackstock listened without miss-
ing a word

  but his aspect was ominous and his in-
quiries were more so

  if your project promises such profits
why he asked do you come up here to
sell stock why dont you go to new
york or montreal where there are so many
rich men wishful to invest

  we want to scatter our stock among the
plain people-we dont want capitalists in
our company finch replied

  i should suppose one mans money is
as good as anothers

  youre wrong there mr blackstock
we want to build up a company that will
have the public confidence and the way to
do it is to scatter the stock among a great
many small stockholders the pennsyl-
vania railway-

  i dare say a great deal of money has
been lost in oil

  not as much as has been lost in farm-
ing farmers in saskatchewan have lost
more money by frost in the last five years
than was ever lost in oil

  i have my doubts-i have my doubts
thats all right-theres always a
doubt the best investments in the world
were doubtful investments in the first place
-its only where theres a doubt that you
can make the lucky strike if it wasnt for
the risk that scares out the weak souls
thered be no chance for the strong men to
take it and get rich youre a strong man
mr blackstock and if youll go in with
us well make it worth your while

  that was a daring shot but it fell short
blackstocks verdict was adverse

  i believe you are a swindler mr
finch he frankly declared and to neigh-
bors who came asking what he thought he
made answer-

  any man who puts his money in that
concern will never see it again

  blackstocks wife never thrust herself
into high councils such as these it was
much more like her to efface herself when
men came to talk with her husband about
affairs but the house was small she was
busy in her kitchen with the door open and
she couldnt help but overhear particu-
larly since he spoke out emphatically she
overheard her husband say-

  any man who puts his money in that
concern will never see it again

  her faith in him was boundless

at the epsom hotel in epsom town
john waldo finch waited moodily
by the front window for the hour when his
train should come and take him away from
those parts he had just paid his bill and
it was so much money thrown away for
he was leaving those parts without having
sold a solitary share of stock in the pen-
guin leases

  he was sore and disgruntled

  do you know a parson out east of town
by the name of blackstock he asked the
landlord

  the landlord had heard of such a per-
son

  im told he preaches sermons an hour
long he remarked

  finch spat his disdain

  deliver me he snarled from any man
who tries to be a farmer and a parson and
scotch all at the same time of all the
stubborn stingy penurious narrow sel-
fish clammy-

  he checked himself a bell clanged
loudly somewhere in the back part of the
hotel and the landlord hurried away in
answer to the summons finch flung him-
self back in his chair and stared sourly out
of the window

  presently as he stared a rickety old
buggy drew up in front of the hotel and a
bent little wisp of a woman alighted she
wore glasses but even with their help
seemed short of sight so that she peered
about her with an air of uncertainty and
fumbled awkwardly at the straps as she
hitched her dull and sleepy horse to a post

  when she had got the horse hitched she
fished an ancient leather wallet out from
under the ragged cushion of the buggy and
climbed up the steps to the hotel

  i wish to speak with mr finch she
announced from the doorway

  finch was promptly on his feet he
wasnt so sore and disgruntled as to have
forgotten his manners altogether

  thats my name he answered

  the woman came nearer and eyed him
fixedly through her glasses

  the mr finch who sells shares in oil
wells she specified

  im the man he assured her

  well id like to buy some shares

  certainly maam about how many
shares would you like to buy
iz

ramsey benson

  what does a share cost

  the price today is one dollar

  well ill take ten thousand shares
heres the money

  so saying the woman unwound the strap
of her old wallet and brought forth several
certificates of deposit these she handed
to finch

  count them she directed

  finch was visibly flustered but he made
a quick recovery he took the certificates
set down the sum of each on the landlords
blotter and cast up the figures while the
woman calmly studied the design of the
wall-paper

  they come to ten thousand fifty six
dollars and eighty cents he informed her

  well you may take ten thousand dol-
lars and pay me the fifty six dollars and
eighty cents-ive got to buy me a shawl
and some things she rejoined

  when the landlord came back to that
part of the house finch and the woman
were out on the sidewalk in front finch
had unhitched the horse and was helping
the woman into the buggy with considerable
ceremony evidently something had come
over him he bowed and waved his hand
genially as the woman drove away and
when he came back into the hotel he over-
flowed with good-feeling and whistled an
air under his breath

  he vouchsafed no explanation the
landlord didnt know who the woman was
and finch hurried off to catch his train
without enlightening him

for four months there was no preach-
ing in the little schoolhouse neigh-
bors missed the sermons for they were a
pious folk they kept up the sunday-
school and every thursday night they got
together for prayer but no such devices
though they were good in their way could
take the place of the preaching

  there was quiet talk of having some-
body else come out from epsom neigh-
bors werent used to paying their pastor
but they felt rich these days and they
wouldnt mind any reasonable expense

  but because it might look like an affront
to blackstock nothing was done nobody
had the heart to speak to him and ask his
consent neighbors thought he was break-
ing up and would never preach any more
but not for the world would they let him
know that they thought so

  it was a wonderfully mild open winter
very little snow fell the blizzards were few
and far between and for weeks at a stretch
there was never a cloud to hide the sun
the money which neighbors might have
given to finch they kept and spent for
improvements about their farms and the
open weather greatly favored the work
the countryside resounded with the clatter
of saws and hammers a busy winter in
short and joyously only for the lack of
preaching

  but there was no joy for blackstock
he did nothing but mope neighbors pass-
ing by saw him out on the big rock some-
times after it had grown so dark they could
barely make him out they wondered if
he stayed there all night they pitied the
woman and wished to help her with her
burden but the most they could do was
to go over and call on the blackstocks
often

  neighbors were astonished to see how
well the woman bore up she seemed to
grow stronger under her trials and more
cheerful they could scarcely get a word
out of blackstock but the woman talked
and visited with them as if there were
nothing amiss

  the silsbys were nearest and a glorious
soft evening in february with a full moon
to light them on their way they drove over
to take supper and spend a few hours
silsby since the big crop had been taking
a daily newspaper from winnipeg and he
was fairly bursting with the things he
wanted to tell blackstock took no news-
paper he hadbooks but he had ceased to
read them

  one thing especially lay heavy on
silsbys mind the company were seated
at the table and he could scarcely wait for
the blessing to be asked before he was out
with it

  you remember the man finch-he that
had the oil stock to sell he asked

  the woman set her teapot down rather
suddenly blackstock was like a graven
image

  well hes in jail-in dakota silsby
related breathlessly it says in the paper
theyve got evidence that will send him to
the penitentiary he has swindled people
out of more than a quarter of a million
dollars all told theres no such concern
as the penguin leases-its the worst kind
of a fraud
  the woman picked up her teapot

  do have a cup mr silsby she urged
hospitably	

  when the company were gone though it
was- after ten oclock blackstock put on
his rough peajacket and fur cap his wife
asked him where he was going and he didnt
answer then she bade him wait a moment
-she had a confession to make

  she laid some papers in his hand and he
regarded them dully

  what are these he inquired without
interest

  they are shares of stock in the penguin
leases they cost ten thousand dollars i
bought them with the certificates of deposit
which you left in my keeping

it made a stir when the word went up
and down that blackstock would preach
at the schoolhouse the next sunday
neighbors never thought of it as anything
but a farewell sermon however they took
the word to mean that blackstock would
preach just once more and bid them good-
by they assembled as at a funeral

  but it was no such thing blackstock
stood up before them and he was no more
broken than a boy he held his head high

his eyes flashed though his rugged face
couldnt be anything but sober they beheld
it radiant as never yet

  and as never yet they heard him preach
he took his text from job but whereas job
had made his book an epic of resignation
blackstock turned it into a song of victory
and exultation

  the lord gave and the lord hath taken
away-blessed be the name of the lord
he read out and his voice rang like a trum-
pet

  neighbors were greatly at a loss the
best they could make of it was that black-
stocks health had suddenly taken a turn
for the better

  his wife was in her place down in front
she gazed up at him through her glasses in
the accustomed way-steadfastly respect-
fully neighbors werent used to thinking
that she understood her husbands sermons
very clearly they fancied that she lis-
tened and gave strict attention rather be-
cause as the ministers wife it was in an
especial sense her duty to do so than be-
cause the discourse meant much to her
thej regarded her as a simple soul-very
good but only ordinarily bright

  she wore a new shawl

the pawn-shop

  above ungardened alleys

   what fairy fruits are these
   dangling the golden apples
   of the iiesperides
   were no more brightly burnished

   less gleamingly were tossed
   the shining trophies on the way
   that atalanta lost

   no more beneath the brazen bough
   guarding the hoarded gold

   there coils a scaly serpent

   no longer as of old

   the path is set with perils

   perseus his treasure spent

   may here beneath the triple balls
   borrow at six per cent

 a two-part story
 concl usion

chapter xi

in which a year is made to pass as
quickly as possible

of papa tons return of the year
that followed at bayou portage it
is neither easy nor pleasant to
write also i fear that as yet my
tale has held far more shadow than sun-
shine therefore for the sake of those
who have borne with me this far as well
as for my own i will strive to be brief

three days after christmas papa ton
returned disheveled ill and empty-handed

  ah toinette toinette what can i say
to you he cried as he crept overside it
was just like the last time only worse
and through it all i thought of you so that
i had to keep on to drown my shame

  it is always your face that i see at the
bottom of the glass toinette-your face
as it will look upon my return

  and toinette her eyes a blur of love
and pity could only grip him hard about
his great neck and answer

  bien papa ton you are back again
at any rate in with you now and to bed
until you are yourself once more

  slinking to the hut in silence the big
man lay as one dead for two nights and a
day at the end of this time he arose and
having gulped down an enormous meal re-
sumed the burden of the marsh

  at sight of my skins he was loud in his
praises declaring that he himself could
have done no better also he insisted uppn
dividing equally with me a thing which i
stoutly refused to allow in the end he
gave in turning his back that i might not
witness the emotion born of his gratitude

  good jean he gulped believe me i
will not soon forget this and remember
we are partners once the debts are paid
it is your right

  of his carouse he spoke to me but once
yet there was a sermon in his few words

  you have seen he questioned the first
moment that we were alone then do
not forget if ever you would drink fill
your first glass with poison itself that
will be quicker for you and better for the
ones you love

  for a time papa ton spared his broken
spirit no single stroke from the twin
scourges of remorse and shame never be-
fore had i know him so tender so humble
so grateful for the slightest favor he was


jean trolve

like a child who having committed an un-
noticed fault is divided between wonder
and gratitude at the punishment withheld

  also as in the case of his former defec-
tion he performed prodigies of work harry-
ing the marsh until the last penny of his
debt had been accounted for and the skins
had gone up to the bridge together with a
second lot that was to replenish our larder
and settle the score of borrowed supplies

  it is to these days of contrition and en-
deavor that i love best to look back when
i think of papa ton childish always he
at this time became literally our charge
indeed so great was his bewilderment his
indecision that had we not ordered him
about i doubt that he would have got be-
yond a vague and helpless groping after
the solution of his many difficulties

  so the first weeks of the new year passed
amid an atmosphere of love and pity which
despite our need rendered them the hap-
piest that i had known at bayou portage

  then his debts paid and his system
cleansed of the poisons of the mainland
papa ton began to develop his old rest-
lessness and instability of purpose all
along he had refrained religiously from any
mention of the camp below now uncon-
sciously his thoughts began to slip the
leash of his determination

  so jean he observed one night i
hear that we have a newcomer in the per-
son of your friend msieu dugas

  a few days later he remarked

  they say that it is quite a place at the
lower camp bien i must see for myself
not as a customer of course but merely
to look around

  these were warnings not to be disre-
garded and in our despair we sent for le
bossu  had he come at once it is pos-
sible that the danger might temporarily
have been averted but by the time the
little mans answer arrived telling of an
expedition to lake tasse and the obliga-
tion of a newly formed partnership papa
ton had stolen off for a two days stay at
the lower camp

  upon his return there was another debt
a debt that must be paid at once this
necessitated a second trip below and a sub-
sequent stay of another two days toinette
and i were aghast it was even worse than
we had feared

  after this we settled down to a hopeless
fight against the rapacity of monsieur

dugas always was toinette scrimping
and saving always was i tramping the
marsh for skins that melted away down-
stream and always monsieur dugas
reached out for more grudging us the very
food that went into our mouths

  at first papa ton held rigidly to our
partnership so that thert was always my
share of the skins to fall back upon but
so importunate a creditor was monsieur
dugas and so piteous was the big mans
need that soon i began lending a skin-or
two to complete the required amount

  the result of this was inevitable each
time the amount increased until the catch
began to go as a whole

  now if i have made it appear that mon-
sieur dugas was solely responsible for our
misfortune i am fully justified each step
of papa tons downfall went further to
convince me that it was not the big mans
fault as toinette always said he meant
well and tried hard indeed had monsieur
dugas merely let him alone i doubt that
his case would have been so desperate

  but monsieur dugas had not served his
secret bar for nothing in the art of temp-
tation he was a past master did papa
ton poisoned and repentant stay away
from below a week lip would come a pres-
ent in the shape of a small bottle once
that bottle had been drained papa ton
was beyond all power of persuasion

  as for papa ton i can say of him that
through all this bitter time never once did
he cause our love for him to waver al-
ways he was kind and gentle and the love
that he returned us was like some living
thing that was the pity of it the pity
that well-nigh broke our hearts

  ah jean jean toinette would often
cry if only he would beat us then we
might hate him and it would not be so
hard what are skins and food compared
to his love

  thus the year dragged itself out to hot
weather and our departure for the bay

  this second summer there were but
three of us upon the toinette for le bossu
was unable to join us again it was a part-
nership the little man sending word that
he would be occupied until the following
christmas when we would see him without
fail as a consequence papa ton made a
lonely restless cruise punctuated with
visits to the coffee-house of the coast

  upon our return to bayou portage long
ib	nevil g

in advance of cold weather we faced a
situation which promised to be even more
serious than that of the season before
early in the summer young pierre valsans
wife had deserted him entirely and young
pierre returning to the camp had sought
io drown his troubles in drink

  his companionship was the one thing
needed to complete papa tons ruin if
before the lower camp had been at the big
mans elbow valsans swift launch now
placed it in his very hand always the
two were slipping down the bayou some-
times making a half-dozen trips in one day

  soon our case became truly desperate
with the approach of christmas there was
no talk of the bridge never again it
seemed would our skins find their way up-
stream we could only hope that le
bossu learning of our plight would bring
down a stock of supplies

   so we struggled on through the last
weeks of the old year and then with christ-
mas but four days off and the little mans
arrival a matter of hours the end came-
a terrible end that leaped upon us with all
the swift cruelty of the wild

  it was late in the afternoon and our
days work done toinette and i had gone
down to the landing le bossu had sent
word that he would arrive either that night
or the following morning and papa ton
as usual had gone with young pierre to
the lower camp

  we had pleaded particularly hard with
him that day reminding him of le bossus
arrival but the big man had reached a
stage where if he fought temptation at all
he merely battled with weak excuses he
would be right back he declared this
was not pleasure but business only let
him settle a small account and he would
leave without lifting so much as a glass

  thus with two travelers to look out for
we kept watch both up and down-stream
also we spoke brightly of the days to come
tasting a happiness which was all the
sweeter in that it had been long delayed

  for the first time in many months we
had found a rift in the dark clouds of the
future le bossu was coming and this
meant not only freedom from want but an
influence that papa ton had ever been un-
able to withstand

  and even should the little man fail
this time we had a plan it was a vague
nebulous plan which involved our removal


henshaw

to some other camp and as yet we had
hardly dared to put it into words

  of course it was unthinkable but if the
worst came to the worst we meant to try
it with the help of le bossu in all the
marsh there was no other who would have
dared to suggest such a thing to papa ton

  come jean said toinette finally
why twist our heads off trying to look
both ways at once let us make a game of
it i will look up and you will look down
and the first to see boat or launch will be
the winner

  bien i agreed

  and in the same breath i added-
your choice was bad for you have lost
already

  but that is only a pirogue objected
toinette as she turned to see

  look beyond i ordered

  but still it is not the launch persisted
keen-eyed toinette it is a rowboat no
there are two boats see how the water
glints between

  rising to my feet i shaded my eyes that
they might the better pierce the gray of the
approaching twilight now i could see
that toinette was right there were two
skiffs moving side by side and ahead of
them skimming at top speed came the
pirogue

  indeed so hard did the paddler drive his
strokes that he was within hail of us before
even i-could comment on his haste

  hola you he shouted bring help
there has been an accident

  i started off obediently enough but there
was no need to follow his instruction
other eyes had been watching the bayou
and already the partners were on the run
followed closely by father lasalle

  turning to toinette i found that she
had not moved in her eyes was a look of
agonized impatience and the hand she had
clutched to her heart was gripped so fiercely
that the knuckles showed white through
their tan

  ah hurry hurry she begged each
moment will mean so much

  and why i asked bewildered

  it is papa ton she answered dully
i know jean i know

  her hand rose and came back with a
thud as she added-

  i can feel it here

  by now the pirogue had shot alongside
and the partners had seized its occupant

  well they questioned

  it is your two from here laval and
valsan panted the man they were
blind with drink they were mad to try
that launch from what i heard the en-
gine would not start and valsan went for-
ward for gasoline with which to prime it
he was smoking and the tank exploded
not so as to blow out but in a great spout
of flame valsan fell stunned and laval
plunged forward to save him it was all
over in a moment we had put out and
taken them off in less than five minutes
after the first flash valsan is badly
burned but he will come out of it

  he paused and in the horror of that mo-
ment it was toinette who first found voice
to ask the already answered question

  and laval she demanded as though
she feared the usual papa ton might be
misunderstood

  the man looked away evidently he
understood only too well

  he is bad he muttered up there
at the tank it was like a wall of flame not
being himself he swallowed a lot

  dalfrey held out a kindly hand

  come little one said he you had
best be inside

  but by then the boats had come and lit
was too late to go

  in one young pierre smoked and singed
beyond all recognition hid his dreadful
black face in the charred cover of his
hands

  ah dieu bon dieu he croaked in his
returning consciousness as he slowly rocked
from side to side

  in the other face down between the
thwarts lay papa ton he lay stiffly with
a great arm thrust out on either side to
brace him and although he jerked and
quivered in his agony he made no sound

  those who brought him said that he had
been that way throughout the endless tor-
tured journey up-stream also he had
spoken but once and then only to explain

  i must save myself for toinette he
had said

chapter xii
papa ton sets forth dll large

they got papa ton to the hut and into
his bunk where he lay upon his back
panting in great strangled gasps that tore

the very soul of him at once toinette
sprang to his side rubbing his head pat-
ting his hands striving frantically for some
means to stay his pain

  as for myself i could only drop down
beside the bunk and sob my grief into the
stiff folds of the rough blankets

   dieu swore silent borges this will
not do we must have a doctor

  then papa ton spoke in a strange
cracked voice that seemed to come from a
very great distance he spoke slowly and
with many pauses bringing forth each word
as if it had been achieved through some
miracle of pain

  it-is-no-use he said i-am-
through leave-me-with-my-own

   i arose as the men filed out and thus i
was enabled to see that among those of
our camp there was not one whose eyes
were dry somehow it was as if the true
tragedy of the affair had been withheld
until the moment of papa tons speech
the flames had done their work well of
the great rumbling voice only a few sere
ashes remained to be rustled by the breath
of agony

  the men gone papa ton spoke again
this time to rebuke our grief

  no he struggled no-tears it-
is-best-this-way i-was-going-
down- i-could-not-stop

   a pause and he added

  i-have-seen them-those-old-
half-dead - men-of-the-coffee-houses
i-escape-that-at-all-events

   after this he seemed to doze lying silent
a long time while toinette sobbed softly
and i wrenched uselessly at the twist of
cover that i had seized in my despair
tante odile crept in and after a look
around slipped quietly out again

  from beyond the door came a subdued
murmur of voices and the grating of rough
shoes upon the broken shell the men
were waiting at hand in case of need

   unable longer to endure the inaction i
finally rose and mended the fire blindly
heaping on the driftwood until the whole
room was aglow at this papa ton roused
himself calling me to him and beginning
to speak in a pitifully weak and broken
voice yet with a clearness and steadiness
that had been wholly denied him before
thus at the very end his endurance earned
its reward

  jean you must look after toinette
	nevil g henshaw

he began you must promise there is
my sister but she will not be like you
papa ton papa ton i cried how
can you ask such a thing of me

  bien he sighed i knew but it is
good to be sure also you must see that
they put me here in the marsh i could
not lie easy elsewhere

  for the rest do not grieve you and
teinette it is not so bad this death i
am setting forth au large that is all al-
ways i have been the stay-at-home my
brothers my sisters they all went out in
the world while i hugged this camp now
it is my turn au large jean au large
toinette that is all

  he paused and now there were tears in
his own eyes those tears of pity that alone
could be wrung from his brave heart

  courage mes enjants he whispered
i tell you it is for the best

  he broke off again to heave himself up-
right with a stifled gasp

  quick your hand toinette he choked
this is a lonesome business after all

  and then as toinette gripped him he
eased suddenly back upon the blankets
releasing a deep grateful breath as does a
thirsty man who has had his need of cool
water

  my little toinette he murmured and
lay still

  later when we could not but be sure
toinette found heart to speak

  you will leave us dear jean she
begged i would like to be with him
alone for just a little while

  and so i went out where the men re-
ceived me kindly yet with that strange
aloofness which had so impressed me upon
the occasion of my fathers death

  he is gone asked several at once
yes i replied and unable to bear
more i slipped away from them to the
seclusion of the shed

  here amid a litter of nets and ropes and
broken oars i hid my grief while the men
still waited at the door so near that now
i could catch the words of their low-pitched
conversation

  you see said dalfrey it is what i
predicted and it is but the start who will
be the next one

  yes it was dugas fault muttered a
strange voice he should not hav let
them go and our camp is worse than this
sometimes there is no trap set for days

  he will ruin us all growled a second
stranger myself i can not keep away

  yet there is a remedy a sure one of-
fered dalfrey we have but to stick to-
gether

  you mean- began the first voice

  let us wait for more interrupted
father lasalle bad news travels fast
and papa ton was well liked there will
be many who will not wait for morning

  that is right agreed dalfrey it is
a job for all the marsh come let us go to
the landings just now we can do nothing
here

  i heard them go thankfully enough nor
did i give so much as a thought to the
meaning of what they had said for the
moment i experienced a sense of desertion
of abandonment such as i had never known

  it seemed that i must remain a derelict
ever seeking an affection that would en-
dure of the several who had offered me
their love and protection not one remained
first there had been my father then mad-
ame therese and now papa ton

  dear blundering papa ton who even
beneath the grind of the marsh had refused
to grow old as i thought of him all the
dross of his life slipped away leaving only
his heart of gold

  the care the need the toil of the past
year what did it all amount to now
gladly would i go through it again and
again for but one call of the big voice one
squeeze of the mighty arms

  i knew true grief there in the shadow of
the old shed grief that ever grew beneath
the lash of memory and then when it
seemed that i could stand no more there
came a patter of light footsteps a soft-
called jean that brought me out into the
open with a rush

  ah bossu i cried while hope and
gladness flooded back into my forsaken
soul i knew that there must be some
one after all

chapter xiii

  le bossu talks beneath the stars

later when toinette had finally sub-
mitted to the kindly ministrations of
tante odile and had been led away le
bossu and i slipped out for a breath of air
before the hut

romance
jean trouve

  it was a wonderful night still and cold
and the stars shone so brightly that it was
as if each had trimmed its lamp to welcome
the big man home we sat long beneath
the tiny beacon- ights and as we sat le
bossu spoke of the past telling of things
at which he had but vaguely hinted before

  we will miss him papa ton he began
in all my life i have never seen his like
he was so true so honest so kindly to all
save himself yet as he told you it was
best for him to go he had slipped far
down in the well and i doubt that we could
have raised him again

  had i known his true plight i would
have come to him despite a dozen partner-
ships you must believe that you and
toinette otherwise i could not bear it
yet as i have said my coming could hardly
have sufficed

  and another thing-papa ton died well
and bravely but for him young pierre
would have roasted alive you must al-
ways remember this it was a good way
to go

  le bossu paused and when he spoke
again it was with the slow absent words
of one who gropes amid half-forgotten
memories

  ah but you should have known papa
ton in the old days he went on they
were a big family the lavals and they
were proud with the pride of long standing
of the many brothers and sisters papa ton
was the only one whose ways were plain
and simple and for this he was the most
loved the best remembered of them all

  what if as a boy he threw away his
books to run wild in the fields and forests
what if as a man he refused to go out
into the world ever sticking to the old
home like a rabbit to its burrow what if
later on he married unprofitably picking
out the daughter of a poor tenant farmer
these things do not count with humble
folk they look  farther than the gen-
erous heart the kindly word the willing
hand

  you should have seen papa ton as he
used to ride into town here is oton
some one would cry and all down the
street the people would hurry out from
their houses for a look and a word

  it was the beginning of his ruin this
popularity each man must drink his
health and he was never the one to leave
a treat unnoticed true in these days he

was the master of himself but he had al-
ready forged those fetters which only
awaited some moment of weakness to bind
him

  and then with the death of his wife
the opportunity came she was a good
wife and she meant everything to papa
ton also her end was too swift too
dreadful for his slow heavy mind one
morning she was singing about the house
before sunset sh was gone leaving
toinette to fill her place

  after that papa ton gave up it was
too much for him he could not under-
stand all he knew was that forgetfulness
could be had for the drawing of a cork
his friends tried hard but it was no use

  yet even in that dark hour he did not
forget these friends one day he rode into
town and bade farewell to all

   i am going to the devil and it is not
a nice thing for you to see he said
therefore i mean to find some spot where
i will be alone

  that night he slept at the bridge
next morning having bought a boat he
put out for the coast with toinette for a
time he drifted finally coming to rest at
this spot since then he has been as much
a part of the marsh as the grass itself

  so that is papa tons story and i have
told it that you might hear it from one who
knows

  the little mans voice died out and for
a while he sat musing

  and now for the future jean he con-
tinued suddenly rousing himself papa
tons death will bring many changes
what you do is of course your own affair
but one thing i want you to know at my
camp a place is waiting for you come
what do you say you will join me

  that is good of you bossu i
answered it is what i should like above
all things but i must stay with toinette

  so said he it is what i expected
nevertheless i would not act hastily you
are getting on jean you are a man now
in size and experience and your future lies
just before you what you do now will
perhaps determine the whole course of your
life also whereas you have done well
with the skins you were not born to be a
trapper indeed my offer of just now was
made chiefly that you might know my love
for you


nevil g hens haw

  he waited for his words to sink in and
then added quietly

  no jean you are not for the marsh
your place is on the hill-top by the bridge
it is where you belong

   on the instant i had seized him shaking
him in my surprize and consternation
what i cried you know

  most certainly he smiled but you
need not fear jean i have told no one
nor will i do so without your permission
but how- i began

  jean jean he interrupted at least
give me credit for a little sense did you
look like the nephew of an uncle jules
good blood can not be denied even upon
the marsh take toinette for example i
guessed from the very first afterward
knowing the story of your parents and
hearing of your journey to the island it
was not hard to make sure

  and my mothers people i questioned
speaking for the first time of a matter over
which i had often puzzled

   the little man shook his head

  there was only an old father and he
was not of this country he replied after-
ward he went away

   so said i and for a space i could only
stare at him half-stupefied by my utter
amazement

   it seemed incredible that for this little
man my carefully guarded secret had been
no secret at all

  and so you knew i muttered you
knew all along

   as i have said agreed le bossu brisk-
ly there were a hundred things to give
you away yet you set me one riddle to
puzzle over and that was your fear of be-
ing found out come now what is the
answer

  it was msieu dugas i answered i
was afraid that he would take me away
and there is the general also you do not
know how hard and cruel he is i do not
like to think of what would happen if he
were to get his hands upon me

   the little man chuckled reaching out to
shake me in turn-a long comforting shake
of kindly reassurance

  come wake up jean he ordered
you are still frightened by the nightmare
of your arrival you are no longer the
small runaway of two years ago you are
a big strong youth hard and quick and
well able to look out for yourself

  as for dugas he is of all men the one
least able to harm you they have driven
him from the mainland and if my ears
have not failed me tonight he will fare no
better here

  also you need have no fear of msieu
the general had he meant you ill you
would have heard from him long before
now do you imagine that he has gone on
in ignorance of his grandsons whereabouts
he has a long arm that old msieu the
general some day he will reach out for
you and it is of this that i am thinking
you are a fine youth and it must be very
lonely on that hill-top suppose you try
again before laying your plans for the
future

  bossu i flared how can you say
such a thing would you have me creep
back after having been driven away be-
sides if the general were to come for me
himself i would not go with him what
do i care for that hill-top i want you and
toinette and all the other folk who have
been good to me

  again the little mans hand went out
this time in a clutch of silent approval

  bien said he after a while you
have made your choice and i love you for
it nevertheless you are acting like the
boy that you are in this world riches and
power are not to be despised when you
are older you will know for the rest
i feel that i have done my duty by you
it was not fair that you should go ahead
with your eyes closed to the great chance
that might be yours for the asking

  you need not have troubled i put in
i will never ask even if i wished to i
could not leave toinette

  then your future is easily arranged
said le bossu since you mean to stay
with toinette there is no need to consider
you further where she goes you go and
there is an end of it as for toinettes
going that is a matter to be settled by
madame alcide the sister of papa ton
of all the lavals she loved papa ton best
and she will be sure to come when i send
for her

  rising he added

  and now in with you to toinettes
room where you must get such rest as you
can i will keep watch until morning
rising also i was about to go inside
when i noticed that le bossu had paused
to stare intently down-stream following

romance


jean t

the direction of his gaze i saw that for a
short distance the sky was all glowing and
a-quiver with flame

  the hunters said i they grow
more careless each year let the wind
shift and it will go hard with the lower
camp

  it is the lower camp or rather the
coffee-house corrected le bossu they
were preparing for it when i arrived i
would have gone myself had there been
any need

  and msieu dugas i questioned

  the little man shrugged

  that is his affair although you may
trust him to look out for himself he re-
plied if he is wise he will take to the
marsh slipping out to safety by way of the
bay peaceful though i am i would not
like to trust myself to keep finger from
trigger were i to see him coming up the
bayou

  we watched until the glow had faded
out leaving only a smudge of sullen red
that glowered like some dull evil eye
across the shadowy reach of the grass

  bien muttered le bossu as he turned
away it will be a long time before this
marsh sees a better nights work the only
pity is that it was not done before for
us it is like the springing of an empty trap

chapter xiv

madame alcide

in the dawn of the following morn-
ing le bossu shook me awake and
carried me off to breakfast with the la-
salles for the present we would eat there
he explained as we tramped the short dis-
tance through the brisk morning air also
toinette would remain under the care of
tante odile until her future had been pro-
vided for	
arriving at the lasalles we found
toinette waiting for us in the doorway
she was very pale and very quiet and to
our greetings she replied only with a low
mechanical

  well bossu well jean

  afterward she slipped back against the
wall standing rigidly in one spot until
tante odile called her to table

  it was a cheery meal that breakfast for
throughout its brief course it was enlivened

 - rom

rouve	

by the bright chatter of the little lasalles
ordinarily toinette would have made the
most of her opportunity laughing and teas-
ing until she had produced a perfect
pandemonium of merriment

  now she sat as if frozen deaf even to the
all-absorbing conversation of the elders

  as was natural the talk turned upon the
raid of the night before in which father
lasalle had played a prominent part it
had all been as simple as it had been com-
plete	

  led by dalfrey the trappers had slipped
down the bayou and had surrounded the
coffee-house without so much as a word of
opposition having broken inside they
had smashed all the cases and bottles be-
fore setting fire to the building after-
ward they had stood by to see that the
flames did not spread to the other huts or
to the near-by marsh

  each move had been carried out with
the care and deliberation of a legal pro-
ceeding there had been no noise no
rowdyism of the large stock of liquor
destroyed not one drop had been drunk by
the invaders

  as for monsieur dugas he had risked no
chance on a wait in the marsh evidently
he had been warned in advance for he had
taken to his boat and had escaped down-
stream some time before the arrival of the
men from the upper camps

  it was a lesson that will not soon be for-
gotten observed father lasalle now
they will respect us here on the marsh of
course there is still the chance that dugas
will make trouble for us in that event we
can only plead the necessity of our course
you may rest easy on that score re-
assured le bossu if you have broken
the law dugas has broken it also and he
will be forced to admit his guilt before he
can even so much as mention yours

  not until the last plate had been pushed
aside did toinette recover herself then
amid the clamor of the departing children
she suddenly arose

  i am going home tante odile she
announced you promised that i should
go as soon as breakfast was over

  and so you shall began tante odile
when le bossu broke in upon her

  a moment he interposed before we
separate we must consider our arrange-
ments

  as if the little mans words had recast
nevl g

henshaw

her former spell toinette abruptly re-
sumed her seat she made no protest either
by look or word she was frozen again

  you see whispered tante odile from
behind the cover of her battered coffee-pot
she has been like that ever since she came
you must speak to her jean you must
make her cry she can not go on like this
so toinette continued le bossu
that is a good girl and now for the
first thing which is the informing of your
fathers family to me it seems best that
we should at once send a message to your
aunt -madame alcide as for the others
they are scattered wide and there is little
time also we can count upon madame
alcide to notify them if she considers it
worth while you agree with me in this
toinette answered without raising her
eyes

  you know best bossu she muttered
i only want to go home

  then since you leave it to me i will
send to bois berard at once said le
bossu with a fast launch we should re-
ceive an answer before sundown also i
will instruct madame alcide to put off her
coming until tomorrow

  it would be hard to make her com-
fortable overnight and there is little that
she could do for the rest we can delay
our other arrangements until we hear from
her since their details will depend wholly
upon her answer

  rising he added to me

  you will take toinette home jean i
will join you there once i have arranged
for the launch

  a little later as i prepared to depart
with toinette tante odile called me aside

  speak to her now jean she urged
you may not have a better chance
accordingly once we were outside i
took firm hold upon my courage and spoke
to toinette it was not an easy task and
it was rendered especially difficult by the
consciousness that for the first time there
was a sense of strain between us

  toinette i began you must not

grieve so you must-

  i faltered to a standstill and toinette
abandoning her grief for pity made haste
to answer me

  bien jean said she you need say
no more i understand and i will do my
best if only for your sake but do not
expect too much just now there is some-

thing between me and everything per-
haps it is my sorrow perhaps it is death
itself i do not know when that some-
thing is gone i will be myself again

  she broke off to relapse into her former
attitude of silent misery nor did she speak
to me again throughout the dreary length
of that endless day yet now that  under-
stood i was strangely comforted some-
how i knew that once this nameless bar-
rier was removed we would come together
again in perfect understanding

  three hours before sunset the little mans 
messenger returned he had made good
time and his news was highly satisfactory
madame alcide sent word that she would
set out for bayou portage at daybreak the
following morning

  also she would bring with her the curt
from bois berard the funeral could be
arranged for midday as she would cer-
tainly have arrived before that hour

  le bossu received these tidings with
evidence of gratitude and appreciation

  it is what i expected he declared
she is like that madame alcide for
years she has not seen or heard of her
brother yet the moment she is called upon
she does everything in her power now
the funeral will be a success

  also we must put our best foot forward
it is not often that a place like bayou
portage is visited by such a one as the
widow of alcide berard

  that this impression became general was
soon shown by the preparations that be-
gan and continued until sunset door-
yards were swept drying sheds were
cleaned of their litter and put in order
landings were tested and through the driv-
ing of a nail were freed from the treachery
of loosened boards

  upon the lasalles the burden fell es-
pecially hard for in her capacity of sole
hostess of the camp tante odile found it
necessary to clean up inside as well as out
long after dark she swept and scrubbed
assisted by toinette who alone remained
indifferent to the general bustle and ex-
citement

  those cobwebs toinette tante odile
would cry see they are like a cast-net
out with them and do not forget the smoke
behind remember it is your aunt who is
coming

  and toinette without a word would
march woodenly to the attack like tante
jean trouve



odile she performed prodigies of cleanli-
ness but it was all done with the stolid un-
consciousness of a well-regulated machine
not once did she mention the coming of
her aunt this event like all else remained
outside the strange barrier that had shut
off her world

  throughout the next morning the boats
put in at bayou portage they began to
arrive with the first of the light and from
then on there was hardly a moment when
some craft could not be sighted upon the
bayou in the night the word had gone
forth spreading from camp to camp with
that mysterious swiftness which ever jvings
the tidings of disaster

  now from each nook and corner of the
coast the marsh-folk set out to pay a last
tribute to papa ton that the big man
was well liked had been a matter of pride
at our camp not until now however did
we learn of the true esteem in which he had
been held by all

  indeed we were hard put to it to look
out for the visitors who arrived in an ever
increasing throng beginning with those
who lived near the list extended until there
was hardly a camp within striking-distance
that did not have its representative

  men came from cypremort from onion
bay from isle lapin from the hammocks
little and big there were hunters trap-
pers fishermen oystermen all the harriers
of the coast from those who matched their
strength against the great fish of the bay
to the aigrette-hunters-men who slew
thousands of beautiful and defenseless birds
for the sake of a single feather

  having arrived and discussed the ac-
cident at the landings they clambered up
the bank to fall gravely silent before the
door of the hut here their hats came off
and many upon going inside made a slow
and solemn sign of the cross

  still silent they paused for a moment
beside the bunk where papa ton took his
last rest upon the worn blankets then
they passed out to draw a great breath to
swear softly to demand of those who stood
about if the big man had not been the best
of them all

  next it was a visit to the last of the
huts where young pierre had been left to
the care of his father here old valsan
shuffled distractedly about the one inhab-
itant to catch a glint of silver in the dark
cloud that overhung the camp

   indeed in several ways it was a red-
 letter day for the old man first he had
 come into the public eye an experience dear
 to the heart of even the humblest cajun
 next young pierre had been well punished
 both for his desertion and intemperance
 finally the old man felt that his son was
 returned to him permanently

   immediately after the accident a mes-
 sage had been dispatched to madame
 pierre she had replied by saying that if
 her husband were in need of her care he
 could come to her otherwise he must
 trust to his friends since under no circum-
 stances would she leave the mainland

   thus amid the general grief old valsan
 approached a contentment that was wholly
 foreign to his crabbed nature all day he
 held high court now haranguing the visi-
 tors as to his sons mishap now conducting
 them inside to where incased in a huge
 cocoon of bandages young pierre twisted
 miserably beneath the sting of his burns

   lastly the visitors repaired to the la-
 salles where tante odile caught again in
 the vortex of entertainment strove hero-
 ically to provide them all with the inevit-
 able black coffee it was a miracle that
 filling of the endless procession of empty
 cups ten oclock found the camp stripped
 down to its last handful of berries but its
 reputation for hospitality had been sus-
 tained

   bien sighed tante odile when the
 final cup had rattled empty into its heavy
 saucer we have won but it was a close
 thing a little more and i should have
 been forced to give them bayou water

   thus the morning passed until word
 came from the bayou-bank that madame
 alcides launch had been sighted up-stream
 at once tante odile plunged into a frenzy
 of final preparation while le bossu calling
 to toinette and myself led the way to the
 landings the little man was plainly ex-
 cited and as we waited he admonished us
 earnestly as to our behavior

   do not forget your manners he kept
 repeating you must show madame al-
 cide that even though you are of the marsh
 you know what is due such a visitor

   the effect of this was to throw me into
 a perfect torment of self-consciousness
 for the first time i became aware of those
 awkward penalties that attend a sudden
 growth at once i felt all legs and arms
 and i further discovered that my clothes

ance


nevil g

henshaw

were very old and ragged and were also
several sizes too small for me

  toinette alone was undisturbed clad
in a white dress over which tante odile
had labored patiently the night before she
stared out over the water with the fixity
of a statue

   dicu muttered le bossu interrupting
his admonitions this is too much will
nothing move her

  as he spoke the launch rounded the
mud-flat and swung in toward the landing
in its stern seated between the cure and a
small brown-clothed stranger was madame
alcide

  despite the disadvantages of her posi-
tion my first sight of madame alcide was
an imposing one she was a large woman
tall and broad yet without a suggestion
of stoutness also there was about her an
air of stately repose so jhat even on the
narrow backless seat of the launch she
held herself comfortably erect she was
dressed in a plain black skirt a loose black
sacque and upon her head she wore a black
sunbonnet

  this sunbonnet was the crowning touch
of her apparel not only did it proclaim
her caste it went further and made pos-
sible the dignity of her arrival seated in
the launch in a bonnet or hat she would
merely have appeared ridiculous in the
sunbonnet she was mistress of the situa-
tion

  as the launch slid alongside she made
no movement of greeting or of recognition
waiting quietly until the craft had been
made fast she arose at a word from her
companions and allowed herself to be as-
sisted on to the landing

  it was then that i had a look at her
face a strong yet placid face finely molded
generously proportioned and set with a
pair of shrewd gray eyes the mouth firm
and straight betrayed the character and
determination of its owner and when
madame alcide spoke there was blended
with the graciousness of her tone a well-
defined note of authority

  this is msieu jean le bossu she
questioned

   the little man made his best bow

  at your service madame

  you have my thanks for all that you
have done msieu said madame alcide
simply and these of course are my
niece and the boy of whom i have heard

izq

  bending she kissed toinette upon the
brow after which she studied her intently
for a moment

  yes you are otons child was her
verdict you are laval all through

  in my fcase she contented herself with a
pat upon the shoulder yet i was well-nigh
overcome done by madame alcide it
was like an accolade

  you are a big boy jean trouve said
she they could have had but little
trouble in finding you

  these greetings over she bethought her-
self of her companions they stood as they
had sat upon either side of her while the
visitors drawn up in a rough semicircle
upon the bayou-bank regarded them with
frank curiosity observing this madame
alcide embarked upon a general introduc-
tion

  pere parmentier is of course well
known to you she began whereupon the
cure stepped forward

  he was a small wiry man with vague
blue eyes and a great shock of snow-white
hair as he advanced he smiled as if in
recognition of many well-remembered faces

  msieu le docteur poussard madame
alcide next announced and the brown
stranger clicking his heels together per-
formed a contortion that was half-bow and
half-military salute

  like the cure he was small and he was
also wrinkled as a fruit is wrinkled after
long exposure to the elements

  for the rest lie was brown in his dress
his complexion in the coloring of his eyes
and his scant thatch of hair even his
voice gave one an impression of brownness
since it had the dry crackling rasp of
ancient leather yet for all this there was
nothing vivid or startling about the doetors
appearance he was as natural as a
withered leaf in a winter forest

  i am honored my friends he declared
also in my capacity of physician i am
here to do what i can

  come poussard interrupted madame
alcide my poor brother is dead he has
been dead for more than a day a thou-
sand doctors could not bring him back
again

  she spoke without a trace of heat nor
did the doctor appear in any way to resent
her rebuke

  later i came to know that their friend-
ship was of a kind where even the greatest

romance
jean trouve

r-

frankness failed to give offense also
whereas madame alcide always spoke to
the doctor as poussard she invariably
spoke of him as ntsieu le docteur

  having completed her introduction
madame alcide turned to le bossu

  i will see my brother first msieu she
announced afterward we had best go
on with the burial it is necessary that i
return home tonight and we have much be-
fore us

  at once le bossu led the way toinette
and i following and the cure and the doc-
tor bringing up the rear passing through
the ranks of the silent and staring visitors
we arrived at the hut where madame alcide
knelt to a brief prayer beside the bunk be-
fore taking a last look at her brother

  it was a long look and when madame
alcide spoke her words contained a pity
beyond the power of expression

  so this is what he ran away to said
she

  she choked silent while two great tears
gathered in her eyes and fell unheeded to
the floor

  come she murmured i have seen
enough

  and she added as we left for tante
odiles-

  death is not so bad after all

  half an hour later the funeral started a
great affair that was the talk of the coast
for many a day i recall it as a long pro-
cession of bareheaded men led by one of
the little lasalles who clad in white robes
held proudly aloft a golden cross back
of the huts a grave had been dug in the
clayey soil and here the partners father
lasalle and three chosen men from the
upper camp lowered the rough box that
they had carried so reverently

  it was a still warm day and only when
the curt raised his voice in prayer did a
little breeze spring up then while the
marsh-folk knelt in the sunlight the whole
great sweep of grass rustled slowly and
solemnly as if each tiny blade bowed its
head in honor of a soul that was gone

  of all the incidents of papa tons fun-
eral i remember best that swaying marsh
and the rigid white face of toinette who
to the very last preserved her stony calm

  so said le bossu when it was all over
and we had turned away it is right that
he should be where he fought and won

  then i understood why papa ton had

wished to lie in the marsh holding in death
the spot that marked his final victory over
the ever encroaching grass

chapter xv

x move on

we returned to the lasalles
where madame alcide refusing all
offers of rest and refreshment entered im-
mediately upon a final adjustment of papa
tons affairs

  i thank you madame but i seldom tire
myself said she in reply to tante odiles
protestations as for food i have neither
the time nor the heart for it just now it
is necessary that i be home tonight and
there is much to attend to with your per-
mission and with the aid of yourself and
the rest i will make my arrangements

  accordingly once madame alcide was
seated in the best of the few ancient chairs
the others gathered round her-tante
odile father lasalle le bossu the curt
and doctor poussard i sat with toinette
upon one of the bunks feeling very much
as a prisoner must feel who awaits the find-
ing of a jury

  it seemed a wholly unnecessary nuisance
this eternal settling of ones future why
i wondered did they not let toinette and
me go on as before we would miss papa
ton terribly but except for this we could
manage as well as ever

  some such thought must have troubled
toinette for her hand crept into mine

you will not leave me jean you will
not let them take me away she begged

  this was reassuring but by now
madame alcide had begun to speak and i
could only squeeze the small cold hand
in reply

  my brother he left anything of value
questioned madame alcide addressing le
bossu

  that depends upon what you mean by
of value madame he replied he leaves
a daughter and a boat both of the name of
toinette also there are some skins some
traps and a few household effects there
is also the hut but that must belong to the
first one who cares to claim it we know
nothing of rent upon the marsh

  he paused while the cure appeared a
trifle dismayed the doctor frankly be-
ne v i l g

henshaw

wildered madame alcide however
seemed capable of a full appreciation of
the little mans quaint humor

  well spoken msieu said she you
are as thorough as you are brief that is
the trouble with most of our people they
talk too much as for what my brother
has left since you seem to consider the
daughter named toinette of chief value
and since it is only human for one to de-
sire the best of everything i will take her
myself

  a wise choice madame commented le
bossu then she goes with you this
afternoon

  she does answered madame alcide
i have already arranged a place for her
in my home

  at this i felt toinettes hand tighten in
mine and a moment later she had risen
dragging me forward with her

  i am sorry madam e but i can not go
with you said she i must be here to
look after jean

  madame alcide received this announce-
ment with a composure wholly uncompli-
mentary to bayou portage one could
see that since arriving at the camp she
was prepared for anything

  you must call me tante aurore not
madame toinette she corrected as for
your staying here with jean it is out of
the question it would not be right or
proper as pere parmentier will tell you
most certainly not agreed the cure
and why is it not right that jean ahd i
should keep on as before questioned
toinette

  this proved too much for madame al-
cides powers of endurance evidently she
bad remembered that after all toinette
was a laval

  child child she remonstrated it is
indeed time that you were with me can
you not understand that you are almost
grown and that before your father was
alive to protect you

  but jean will protect me just as well
persisted toinette he is almost a man
that is just it declared madame
alcide seizing upon this point with an
eagerness that betrayed a close approach
to verbal defeat jean is almost a man
and he is of no kin to you neither is he
your husband under these circumstances
it is impossible for you two to go on living
together

  then if that is the case we will be
married said toinette promptly you
are willing are you not jean

  why of course i agreed pere par-
mentier can marry us before he leaves
madame alcide sighed patiently

  you can not be married you two she
explained you are too young

  then i am too young to marry yet too
old to live with jean asked toinette

  exactly replied madame alcide and
now there was a hint of sharpness in her
voice later you will understand but
we are wasting time you will go home
with me and there is an end of the matter
before replying toinette glanced ap-
pealingly at le bossu the little mans
face was sad but his nod was unmistakable

  bien gave in toinette i will go
then but jean must go with me

  as you wish temporized madame
alcide i will see to it once you are
settled it is probable that it can be ar-
ranged

  toinette shook her head

  jean must go with me she repeated
he must go when i go and he must stay
where i stay otherwise i will not leave
having spoken toinette released my
hand and returned to the bunk where she
froze at once into her attitude of stark in-
difference there was something so de-
cisive so wholly final about the action that
madame alcide was impressed beyond the
power df argument

  well she questioned a little breath-
lessly turning to her advisers

  pardon madam put in le bossu it
is this way with toinette she does not
mean to be bad or stubborn it is only
that jean here has become as a brother to
her and she can not bear to be away from
him it would be kind of you to satisfy
her in this as for the boy i myself will
vouch for him in every respect

  as he spoke the little man gave me a
look that seemed to say

  now is the time for them to know who
you really are but if this is not your wish
you may count upon my silence

  there fell a brief pause during which
madame alcide looked me carefully up
and down evidently she found nothing to
offend her for when she spoke her tone
was one of frank capitulation

  i do not wish to be unkind she began
on the other hand this is a matter de-
jean trouve

serving of some thought i had planned to
take my niece into my home if this boy
comes with her i must arrange all over
again

  she considered a moment and then
added as if the thought had just occurred
to her

  but the boy himself has not been con-
sulted perhaps he would rather remain
come what do you say jean

  i must go madame i replied i
promised papa ton i will work hard i
will live in the woods if there is no place
at your home only let me stay near
toinette and i will be satisfied

  well spoken again said she you
seem quiet and polite jean and you have
a good face

  she broke off wavering and turned to
the cur

  what do you think pere parmentier
she questioned

  you will make no mistake in taking
him came the reply you have room
and he will prove of help to you

 and you poussard continued
madame alcide

  pere parmentier is right answered the
doctor as for work i will if necessary
find him a place in my manufactory
that is settled then decided madame
alcide i will take him and will do the
best that i can for him

  abashed yet grateful i started to
mumble my thanks but madame alcide
waved them aside

  off with you and get ready she
ordered also take toinette if when
you return our business is finished we will
leave at once we can not afford to lose
the tide

  thus i missed the rest of the council
although the disposal of papa tons few
effects was fully explained to me later on
the traps and the household goods were
left with the lasalles who sold them to the
new occupants of the hut the skins taken
to the buyers by le bossu were disposed
of in the usual way

  also the little man arranged for the sale
of the toinette turning her over to a fish-
erman upon the lower coast the money
obtained from these various sources was
spent wholly upon toinettes education

  he would never study oton declared
madame alcide therefore he must do
double duty by his daughter

  of my last visit to the hut i retain only
a memory of unfamiliarity dark cold
curiously disordered by the many who had
come and gone the well-remembered room
was like the abode of a stranger

  somehow as i looked about i felt no
sorrow at the thought of my departure it
was a shell that hut empty even of its
memories with the death of papa ton
the soul had gone out of it

  gathering together such garments as
might be worthy of my new estate i thrust
into the bundle my mothers picture and
the gold-piece given me by madame
therese the picture my one link with
the past i had kept in a sheltered spot

  often i had turned to it in moments of
misfortune to find the vague comfort of
that first night upon the prairie toinette
too never tired of gazing at the sweet wist-
ful face although she always turned away
from it with a light of reflected sadness in
her eyes

  as for the gold-piece despite our many
necessities toinette had never allowed me
to part with this memento of the rue bour-
bon

  no jean she had always replied when
i pleaded the call of our empty larder
remember it was the last gift of your
dear madame

  thus i left bayou portage as rich as i
had arrived nay richer for at the last
moment when toinette had come from her
little room bundle in hand i had a final
thought

  the gun i asked you think that i
might take it

  of course answered toinette were
you not partners you and papa ton

  so i took down and shouldered the old
muzzle-loader together with its bags of
powder and shot also toinette fondly
considered her red-shaded lamp finally
moving it to a prominent place upon the
shelf above the open fire

  evidently although she had decided to
abandon this cherished possession of hap-
pier days she did not mean to have its
importance underestimated by the new oc-
cupants of the hut

  then we passed out and as i shut the
door toinette put into words my feelings
of the past few moments

  it is not so hard to leave she mut-
tered half to herself it is no longer home
it is only a box of boards
nevl g

henshaw

  that was it and now that i knew i
understood the wisdom of our going
madame alcide was right toinette and i
could not have gone on together there
could have been no bayou portage for us
without papa ton

  reaching tante odiles we found the
council over and its participants engaged
in considering a miraculously discovered
pot of coffee at sight of us madame
alcide at once set down her cup

  you are prompt you two she de-
clared also yours is a good example to
follow come pere parmentier come
poussard remember the tide

  at this came a bustle of leave-taking
during which i was kissed by tante odile
smacked upon the back by father lasalle
and mauled by their swarming brood

  also at the landing there was a second
outburst of farewells in which i said good-
by to every one over again this time re-
ceiving a silent hand-grip from the partners
and a long and incoherent blessing from old
valsan before le bossu called me aside

  the little mans eyes were suspiciously
bright and he spoke with a catch in his
voice for he had just taken leave of
toinette

  adieu jean he began adieu and
good luck

  but bossu i exclaimed alarmed by
his choice of words you speak as if i
am not to see you again will you not
come to the woods

  of course he replied but bois
berard is not bayou portage it is out of
my way as it is out of the way of these
other friends of yours you will not see
us often

  then i will come back i cried i
will come back as soon as i can

  the little man shook his head

  no jean said he you will not come
back nor will you wish to you are
through with the marsh you have all that
it can give you it is time to move on

  and that is another thing here the
paths of our lives will separate going dif-
ferent ways for me it is the same old
round of skins and game for you-

  he paused while his arms went around
me in a final embrace

  bui we will see he finished and
now you must go since the others are wait-
ing

  so i left him and went down to the

launch where toinette her good-bys over
sat staring with unseeing eyes at the wav-
ing calling group upon the bayou-bank
even when we slipped out from the landing
and headed up-stream she maintained her
air of mute detachment although i noticed
that the hands that held her bundle were
resolutely clenched

  only when we rounded the mud-flat did
she betray any interest in our departure
then as the inhabitants and the few re-
maining visitors raised a final cheer she
waved with the rest of us until a bend of
the marsh hid the camp from view

  well we are off observed doctor
poussard as if in earnest of his readiness
to take part in any conversation

  but madame alcide was deep in thought

  as you see she replied after which
sheresumed her meditation glancing re-
peatedly from toinette to myself

  as for pere parmentier he had already
begun to doze with his hat pulled over his
eyes so the little doctor his duty done
hunched himself into a crumpled brown
ball and was immediately fast asleep

  thus we journeyed in silence yet for
me the short voyage was replete with in-
terest and incident throughout my stay
at bayou portage i had not been up as
high as the bridge and once the more fa-
miliar reaches of the bayou were passed
each bend of the twisting stream held some
new vision for my well-trained eyes

  now it was a ribbon of muddy beach
starred with tracks and littered with clean-
scraped mussel-shells-a very el dorado
of coonskins now it was a tiny cove from
which whirred frantically a flock of un-
suspecting teal now it was a school of
jumping mullet that glittered for an instant
above the brown water as if nature in her
prodigality had thrown aloft a handful of
silver

  from the banks came the quaint chatter
of the little brown sparrows and the red-
wings those wantons of the marsh flung
themselves into the air again and again
through very joy of life

  then as we approached the bridge i
found a fresh interest in the change that
came over the marsh below the grass had
grown as thick and even as a well-trimmed
hedge there had been no break no rag-
gedness to mar the vast sweep of tiny
blades that marched on to meet the horizon

  now the banks became rough with scat-
jean trouve

tered hummocks and brush-clumps until
as we swung into the last reach below the
bridge the grass thinned out entirely giv-
ing place to the dense riotous growth of
the conquering myrtle

  mallows thrust their stiff spikes above
the feathery myrtle-tops through the
gaps in the brush i glimpsed a smudge of
distant live oaks and then as we slipped
past a clearing made by fishermen the low
hills of marsh island heaved themselves
into view v

  by now the sun had all but dropped
below the marsh rim and when we finally
raised the weatherbeaten pile of the old
warehouse and swung into its landing the
sky was touched with the grayish rose of
the brief afterglow

  at once madame alcide abandoned her
thoughts and having paid the owner of the
launch resumed charge of the expedition

  poussard you will fetch achille she
ordered as we scrambled ashore

  you toinette and jean will wait here
with me until all is ready as for you
pere parmentier there is a place for you
if you will have it

  but pere parmentier although spoken
of as the cure of bois berard was in reality
a resident of the prairie his small church
and still smaller presbylkre lay some dis-
tance from the woods upon the road to st
pierre and he had accordingly ridden in
alone meeting the others at the bridge

  having thanked madame alcide for her
offer he followed doctor poussard around
the corner of the warehouse shortly after
the two reappeared the cure astride a
small wicked-looking pony the doctor
leading an ancient and enormous white
horse that was hitched to a battered surry

  at sight of this equipage madame alcide
saw fit to perform a species of equine in-
troduction

  my horse achille she announced
he is a prince of horses although like his
namesake he is somewhat uncertain about
the heels you know the story

   i replied that i did not toinette merely
shook her head

  then i will tell it to you at the first
opportunity continued madame alcide
without it you can not appreciate the
beast at his true worth

   she broke off to give the horse a friendly
pat upon the shoulder

  he is all right poussard she de-
manded

  the doctor bowed accompanying the
movement with a grimace of pain

  as right as he is heavy madame he
answered ruefully

  then you have been careless pous-
sard chided madame alcide it is quite
evident that he has stepped upon your foot
again	-

  having been assured of achilles condi-
tion madame alcide allowed herself to be
assisted to the drivers seat then while
the limping doctor climbed up beside her
she ordered toinette and me to get in at
the back

  all being ready she picked up the reins
and having drawn them into two horizon-
tal lines suddenly brought them down with
a resounding slap upon achilles back

  the action was so abrupt so vigorous
that i clutched instinctively for support
as at the crack of a starters pistol  ex-
pected that we would dash off at top speed

  achille however was more accustomed
to this demonstration save for a slight
twitching of the flanks he paid no heed to
this signal nor did several others deliv-
ered in rapid succession accomplish any
better result

  madame alcide sighed as she reached
for the switch of peeled oak that did duty
as a whip

  it is your own fault achille she
pointed out cutting under at some vulner-
able spot that caused the old horse to
rouse himself into a slow elephantine
movement that might be best described as
a stumbling walk

  thus we rolled pondrously off crossing
the bridge and causeway while pere par-
mentier followed beside us his every energy
bent to the restraining of his impatient
pony at the edge of the prairie he gave
up the struggle bidding us good night
he loosened rein and at once shot away in
the direction of his home

  after this we labored across the silent
shadowy prairie until finally there loomed
ahead a high black bulwark of forest
evidently achille became seized with a
longing for the comforts of his stable for
he now quickened his pace to such good
purpose that the dark barrier of trees was
picked out with a scatter of lights-very
small and fitful like the glow of fireflies

  then as we went on and the soft swish
nevil g hens haw

of the grass underwheel was asped with a
crackle of dead leaves the lights became
fixed and larger until they developed into
the orange squares of lamp-lighted win-
dows

  so said madame alcide pulling up
before a line of fence that sprang wraith-
like out of the darkness we have ar-
rived

  all along toinette had sat mute and
rigid her bundle clasped in her lap to
the trials of the day had been added a
wearisome journey yet she had uttered no
word of complaint now as madame
alcide descended earthward with a word
to us to follow toinette rose stiffly drop-
ping her bundle at my feet

   jean jean she suddenly cried and
with the words she fairly threw herself
into my arms

  in a moment i had her back upon the
seat again hugging her close to my breast
and there she lay a limp stricken bundle
of despair torn by the fierceness of her
long pent-up grief

   that is right soothed madame alcide
leaning inside to comfort her with a caress
when you have had it out you will be
better

   and she added in an undertone

   you must stay with her jean until it
is over poussard will watch the horse

   so i sat on hugging toinette close while
she sobbed her heart out against the coarse
stuff of my old jacket and as i sat it
seemed as if the strange night-voices of
the woods were raised in a hymn of tri-
umphant joy

   i forgot my doubts my perplexities the
unguessed future that lay ahead for the
long siege was over the barrier was down
and toinette had come back to me again

bois berard

chapter i

bois berard

bois berard a brief thread of
wooden structures strung along the
leafy edge of the forest seemed quite im-
posing after the stark desolation of the
marsh it was a small place even for a

settlement yet the scatter of rough build-
ings was so widely spaced that it conveyed
the impression of being twice as populous
as it really was

  coming in from the prairie along a
grassy woodland road one first encoun-
tered the store of n bonnemaison a truly
wonderful emporium which was said to con-
tain a stock unmatched between st pierre
and the bay the store-building was wide
and deep with a high slanting roof and a
spacious front porch upon its right set
back behind a fence of fancy wire was the
storekeepers home

  this home was the wonder of the prairie
for its owner had modeled it in miniature
from a dwelling in st pierre it was a
square house of a story and a half severe
in its lines to the tops of the upper win-
dows here began an elaborate contortion
of scrollwork pendant from the eaves and
at one side bulged forth a bay-window with
a round peaked roof that resembled a huge
dunce-cap

  next to his business which was founded
upon long years of square dealing mon-
sieur bonnemaison was proudest of his
home always in going to and from his
store he paused for a final glance at it

  you are surprized he would exult
when strangers came to view the marvel
well it would be the same with me were
i in your place

  and he always ended with the joke that
had become a byword in that section

  you see i am good-house himself he
would chuckle even though i am in the
woods i must live up to my name

  beyond the store straggled a line of small
cabins in them dwelt the inhabitants of
bois berard wood-folk who followed no
special calling tending their small gardens
hunting or gathering moss in the forest
turning their hands to such odd bits of
work as came along

  they were a cheery lot indolent and
care-free keenly alive to all forms of
amusement seldom was there a ball a
horse-race or a cock-fight upon the prairie
that could not boast of at least one rep-
resentative from bois berard

  following the cabins came the home of
madame alcide a modest structure in com-
parison with that of monsieur bonnemai-
son yet one far better suited to its en-
vironment dignified by age weather-
beaten to a uniform silvery gray its squat

jean trouve

single story rambled into all sorts of un-
expected and out of the way corners as
a house it had no definite design nor in-
deed had such a thing been considered in
its leisurely haphazard construction

  in the days of madame alcides pros-
perity her husband had often found it
necessary to visit this portion of his hold-
ings accordingly he had built a rough
shelter to serve him when overtaken by
night finding good hunting at this par-
ticular spot he had added to the original
hut that his friends might join him in the
sport

  later when this edge of the forest had
been given his name he had shown his ap-
preciation by adding still more often com-
ing to the woods for weeks at a time
valued by alcide berard solely through
reasons of sentiment this forest retreat had
proved to be a most welcome refuge to his
widow upon his death and the melting away
of his estate

  before the house stretched a broad
ragged lawn shaded by two huge live-oaks
and a sprinkling of smaller trees at the
back was a huddle of outbuildings to-
gether with the prim green rows of
madame alcides kitchen garden inside
the house was merely a succession of rooms
that opened upon the broad galleries flank-
ing the front and rear

  reaching away from the farther limits of
the yard was a pasture its outer edge in-
dented by a sagging line of barbed-wire
fence inside the enclosure thus made
stood a two-roomed outhouse to which had
been added a small lean-to this outhouse
though dilapidated and sadly in need of
whitewash had about it an air of immacu-
late cleanliness and to one of its pair of
doors was nailed a neatly printed sign
which read

  charles aristide poussard

docteur en medecine

  upon the door of the lean-to was a
second sign its letters larger and more
straggly as became its humbler announce-
ment this time was proclaimed

  c a poussard

 manufacture of mattresses

   as for the doctor himself he was the sole
mystery amid the frank simple life of bois
berard years before he had drifted in
from somewhere out in the world small



brown dingy exactly as he had remained
ever since

  of his history nothing was known save
a word dropped here and there at the time
of his arrival in france he had been a
surgeon in the army then there had been
some trouble and he had resigned and come
to america

  this was all but at bois berard it was
well understood that in the trouble doc-
tor poussard had not been at fault he
had shielded some one a relative or friend
or perhaps the culprit had been married
wmie the doctor was a bachelor with no
family to disgrace

  this was the legend woven by the wood-
folk around doctor poussards few words
and i for one accepted it without question
so gravely courteous so utterly honest was
the little doctor that one could not con-
ceive of his having ever committed a wrong

  for the rest the doctor eked out an
existence that was made possible solely
through the charity of his friends trust-
ing him absolutely as a companion they
distrusted him wholly as a physician send-
ing outside for medical advice in all ill-
nesses of a serious nature

  only for slight hurts and simple ail-
ments did they call him in paying him in
money or supplies according to their pros-
perity also they occasionally bought one
of his mattresses-shapeless lumpy affairs
in the manufacture of which he seemed
never to improve

  poussards is a hard case said the
wood-folk it is a miracle that he gets
on

  chiefly responsible for this miracle was
madame alcide from the very first she
had taken the little doctor under her pro-
tection always she was having him in to
meals to sunday dinners to week-day
suppers to little feasts born of the arrival
of some rare or unexpected delicacy

  also she assisted him financially con-
sulting him about an invented disorder
which she termed vaguely my migraine
buying his mattresses and presenting them
in secret to the poor

  but of far more value than these ma-
terial benefits was madame alcides atti-
tude toward the little doctor-the attitude
which brought into his barren pitiful life
a sense of worth and usefulness let any
question of importance arise and madame
alcides first act was to send for the doc-

romance
	nevjl g

tor next having stated her case in full
she would request his advice

  then would follow a period of silent re-
flection after which the doctor would cry
his face aglow with timid pride

  but madame there is nothing that i
can say it is exactly as you yourself have
said i have considered it from all sides
and yours is the only way

  and madame alcide exhibiting a truly
remarkable surprize would exclaam

  but poussard you delight me even
though i am a woman it would seem that
i am not wholly bereft of sense

  at other times she treated him with the
utmost bruskness but this she told me
was done through stern necessity

  you see like most unfortunates pous-
sard is very sensitive she explained
once let him receive the impression of
patronage or of charity and he would dis-
appear immediately then too he must
have faith in himself and this can be ac-
complished in no other way

  to defer to him entirely would either
cause him to become suspicious or over-
sure of himself to rebuff him continually
would crush him and drive him away a
pat here a slap there is the way to keep
him going

  and she added defensively

  but do not undervalue poussard i
tell you that he is one in a thousand he
is never in the way yet when you want
him he is always there

  and for all this the little doctor repaid
his benefactress with a devotion which ap-
proached close to worship always he was
at her command appearing instantly upon
her slightest need for him always he was
ready to advise her to look after achille
to accompany her upon those occasions
when she traveled abroad in state and
always he contrived an unobtrusiveness a
self-effacement that made him a very prince
of attendants

  beyond the doctors cabin the settlement
ended in a second row of cabins the last
of which posed fitfully as a store here a
succession of ever failing proprietors sold
tobacco fruit prize-packages of cheap
candy and the sticky red soda-pop that
was known as rouge

  it was significant that monsieur bonne-
maisons emporium was called the store
while this second smaller place had no
fixed designation at the time of my ar-

henshaw

rival it was known as gilbeaus in honor
of the hardy soul who defied ruin through
its management

  this then was bois berard an oasis of
wood-folk who turning their backs upon
the sunbaked prairie had come gratefully
into the shade of the trees

chapter ii

a start in life

it was wonderful how easily i slipped
into the life of the woods following
the first weeks of strangeness it was as if
i had lived always at bois berard

  established at madame alcides i be-
gan by looking after such of her affairs as
were not beyond my rather limited powers
i cared for achille i tended the garden i
chopped wood and hauled it in from the
near-by forest

  also i spent many hours with rod and
gun so that the table seldom lacked its
supply of fish and game after the toil
of the marsh it was like a holiday and al-
ways my love of the soil increased

  i now found my chief delight in madame
alcides garden and only when some in-
bound traveler passed with his purple
hoarding of seed-cane did i lose my con-
tentment then i thought of those vast
rustling acres beyond the prairie so that
i returned to my kitchen stuff with a
mingled sense of longing and contempt

  as for toinette she at last found her-
self in one of those long-envied homes of
the mainland at first there had been
some talk of the convent but even then
its winter session was far advanced ac-
cordingly toinette joined madame alcide
in the care of the house as yet she lacked
her bright humor her quaint fancy of
former days nor did she soon regain them
in their place came a quiet wistfulness to
mark the memory of her loss

  thus the weeks slipped by until with
the approach of summer i suddenly found
myself at a standstill the garden fully
planted showed not an alien leaf the
care of achille formerly a dangerous ad-
venture had now developed into a tiresome
routine there was no game in the woods
and after the plentitude of the coast the
fishing became a bore

all of a sudden i had nothing to do i

-romance 


jean trouve



had enjoyed my rest but few are the hol-
idays that can not last too long  became
dull and discontented and to the irk of
idleness was added one day the realization
that whereas madame alcide was doing
everything for me i was doing little for
her in return

  the thought of this decided me that
night during the interval between supper
and bed i spoke to madame alcide

  i can not go on like this madame i
began i am used to work and i have
nothing to do

  the old lady shot me a swift glance
sharp yet kindly in her keen forceful
way she had already begun to show me an
affection that i was only too eager to re-
turn

  nothing to do she echoed let us
see the garden is ready

  as you know madame

  and achille

  achille is nothing i retorted con-
temptuously i know him as well as i
know his story and the story of the other
achille

  he no longer stamps upon your foot oc-
casionally persisted madame alcide

  he never tries that now i answered
fhe knows it is no use

  madame alcide sighed resignedly

  ah you young folk she observed
you learn the secrets of everything no
wonder you come to find the world empty
when achille hears my approach he im-
mediately begins to stamp as for pous-
sard let him hitch up and he limps for a
week

  but i am glad to hear you speak this
way jean she continued returning to the
discussion it is not right that one of your
age should be content with the garden and
achille had you gone on i would have
been disappointed in you the time has
come when you must make a start in life
and it is necessary that you be careful of
your choice you have thought of what
you would like to do

  ah yes madame i answered prompt-
ly i wish to plant cane i have always
wished it i will do anything so that i
come to it some day

  madame alcide considered this staring
at me intently the while although she
had never so much as hinted at my past
her reply showed that she had entered upon
a new train of thought

  so jean said she you aim high
for one from the marsh it is something to
be a cane-planter to a certain extent i
might help you since achille can still draw
a plow and i have many acres upon the
prairie but there are other things-the

implements the seed-cane-

  she broke off impatiently with mad-
ame alcide half-way was no way at all

  that is what i am thinking of mad-
ame said i if i begin now to work
hard and save carefully i will in time have
money for those other things then i will
plant my cane using your land and sharing
with you such luck as we may have

  that is fine jean put in toinette
who all this time had been listening care-
fully and if your luck is very good you
may some day have a mill in which to grind
the cane

  madame alcide although not so san-
guine appeared quite satisfied with this
proposal

  bien jean said she it is agreed
you do your part and you may count upon
me to do mine but first of all you must
find work you have decided what you
will do

  i can trap i can hunt i began

  the old lady made a gesture of dissent
you are through with all that she in-
terrupted go back to your skins and
in less than a year you will be a savage
no jean you have chosen your goal and
from now on you must march toward it
not away from it

  there are many things you must know
before ever you put plow to earth and you
can not learn them in marsh or forest if
you would plant cane your place is on the
mainland where the cane is planted

  this was good advice and it was some-
thing more-something that had been wo-
fully lacking upon the marsh for the first
time in many months i harkened to the
voice of ambition

  yes madame said i humbly you
are right my place is here and i would
like to stay but what can i do

  at this madame alcide smiled in benevo-
lent appreciation now that i had become
a petitioner she was all indulgence

  that is my affair jean she replied
while you have been thinking and plan-
ning i have looked about me thus i
found that your best chance is with bonne-
maison he is getting old and each month

romance
	n e v i l g

his business increases also in all the
years he has been here he has never had a
clerk-only some one to come in and help
in time of necessity here is your oppor-
tunity and as it happens it should fit in
very well with your ambition

  at the store you will meet men of all
kinds-planters farmers raisers of cattle
and of horses talk to them remember
their words and when you come to put in
your own crop you will have a store of
knowledge that you could have gained in
no other manner

   she paused while i fairly shouted aloud
in my enthusiasm

  madame madame i cried it is the
very thing and you will let me stay on
here with you

  a soft fond look shadowed for a moment
the keenness of the old ladys eyes

  yes jean she answered i had
thought of that also this fall toinette
goes to the good sisters at st pierre with
both of you away i should have felt very
much alone

   and she added bruskly as if to counter-
act this show of emotion

  so that is settled and now we will go
to bed in the morning i will arrange with
bonnemaison

  that night i enjoyed the luxury of mad-
ame alcides sheets with a mind free from
care never before had i known the
strong unerring force of such a guiding
hand not only had a place been found
for me there had been something about
madame alcides attitude which suggested
that having made me worthy of the place
she would march with me shoulder to
shoulder toward my far-distant goal

  wait my friend she had seemed to
say i am not half-done with you

  the thought of this brought me a sense
of security unknown since the days of the
rue bourbon somehow i felt that my
drifting was over that at last i had found
a true haven amid the cool green reaches
of bois berard

chapter iii

monsieur bonnemaison

true to her promise madame alcide
lost no time in interviewing monsieur
bonnemaison only waiting until break-

henshaw

fast was over the following morning she
donned her sunbonnet and set out for the
store when she returned half an hour
later toinette and i had already cooled our
impatience for a good fifteen minutes out-
side the front gate however once she
was in sight it needed but a glance at her
approaching figure to convince us of her
success

   it is all right jean declared toinette
you can see from the way she walks
had tante aurore failed she would have
come charging back as if she were going
into a fight instead of leaving one

  and see how calm she is i added
that is the best sign madame is only at
peace when she has won

  so we waited wholly confident until
madame alcide arrived and with a brisk
shooing movement of her hands urged us
before her through the gate

  in with you she ordered in a sharp
whisper that was wholly wasted upon the
sunlit emptiness of the roadway

  and she added in explanation as she
hurried us up the walk

  what would you undo all that i have
accomplished here i have been convinc-
ing bonnemaison of the greatness of my
favor in furnishing him with an assistant
while you hang about as if you only
awaited a word from him to jump down
his throat

  but madame alcide was too well satis-
fied with her efforts to prolong this show
of ill-humor upon reaching the gallery
she at once proceeded to relieve our curi-
osity 

  yes she began everything is ar-
ranged but it was no easy task i can tell
you he is a sharp one that bonnemaison
or at least he thinks he is which is the
same thing you see he has run for so
long in a rut that the mere mention of a
change would have thrown him into a
panic had i said to him i have come
to request that you employ my jean as a
clerk he would have been scared out of his
wits

  therefore i began with the weather
saying that it was warm and asking if it
was not hard for one of his age and weight
to get about it was hard he agreed but
what could he do

  when i suggested a helper he threw
up his hands that was harder still he
declared alone he at least had the time
jean trouve



between customers with an assistant
this time was spent in useless instruction
he had neither the desire nor the patience
to instruct a fool

  by now i had made my purchases and
was ready to go also i had opened the
way for my attack

  it was too bad i said nevertheless
could he find some one who was not a fool
his task would be easy enough there was
my jean for example with him one les-
son would be enough

  that might be so he admitted jean
seemed quick enough perhaps some
day-

  but i did not let him finish it was
impossible i declared there was so much
to do about the place and i counted on
jean both for fish and game i could not
spare him for a day

  at this bonnemaison began to argue
but i could try it he insisted jean was
almost a man it was time he made a start
at something beside working about my
place things must be slow now anyway
and the hunting was over

  after this i had only to refuse until
bonnemaison ceased his argument for the
wheedling tone with which he coaxes an
obstinate customer i must give jean a
trial he urged it was my duty how
else would the boy have his chance

  thus when finally i gave in it was
with the understanding that i had con-
ferred upon bonnemaison a very great
favor

  pausing for breath madame alcide per-
mitted herself one of her rare smiles al-
though possessed of a keen sense of humor
it was of the sort that seldom expressed
itself by means of any outward sign

  so that is the way of the world she
finished pointing the moral to her recital
refuse what you wish and in the end it
will be forced upon you only of course
one must go about the matter with the
utmost delicacy

  it is like trapping supplemented
toinette to be sure of a right catch one
must use the right bait and must hide it
well

  madame alcide nodded sagely

  exactly she agreed the bait is
everything

  but see that you do not disturb my
trap jean she went on speaking directly
to me as yet it is only half-sprung

bonnemaison has not accepted you as his
clerk he means only to give you a trial
if you do well and he is satisfied he will
keep you on then people will speak of you
as the clerk until it comes to bonnemaisons
ears

  at first he will be indignant he will
deny the whole affair later when he finds
it is no use he will settle the matter with
himself

   well and what if i have a clerk he
will say is it not my right asit is the
right of every storekeeper bien if jean
is my clerk he is my clerk and there is
an end of it

   after this you will be as much a fixture
as the store itself

  thus madame alcide arranged the mat-
ter and next morning i presented myself
at the store at opening time here i was
received by monsieur bonnemaison whom
through the magic of having become my
employer i viewed with far different eyes
than those of the months before for
judging him solely by his personal appear-
ance i had always considered the store-
keeper with a species of mild contempt

  he was a small stout man and his
stoutness was of such a round puffy sort
that he resembled nothing so much as a
huge animated ball indeed in moments of
excitement monsieur bonnemaison seemed
fairly to bounce along although at ordinary
times he proceeded by means of a sedate
waddle

  his head like his body was smooth and
round beginning with a perfectly bald
crown and ending in a fat pink chin like
that of a baby between crown and chin
appeared a small pair of pensive blue eyes
a button-like nose and a mouth that was
forever set in an amiable smile whatever
his mood monsieur bonnemaison never
lost that smile

  through long practise it had become as
much a part of him as the lips that ex-
pressed it his eyes might betray impa-
tience anger even despair but one had
only to glance below them to be reassured
of his amiability thus to the country at
large the storekeeper was ever more or less
of a puzzle

  he is a queer one that bonnemaison
said the wood-folk you never know
which part of his face to believe

  summed up in a word monsieur bonne-
maison was bland but as i came to learn

romance	i
j	nevil g

his blandness was of a sort peculiar to him-
self outwardly he might appear a mild
contemplative cherub inwardly he was
as inscrutable as a chinese god

  well jean he greeted me and so
you have come to help bicn you can
begin by taking down the shutters in no
other way could you be of more assistance
to one of my age

  this accomplished he led the way in-
doors where for a busy ten minutes he
waddled up and down the two long counters
that lined the store upon either side point-
ing out the different articles and firing their
prices at me with the rapidity and precision
of a machine-gun

  but msieu i protested when finally
his breath gave out it is too much to
learn all at once i could not keep half of
it in my head

  above his smile monsieur bonnemaison
evidenced a mild surprize

  but it is not to be kept in ones head
he explained i could not do it myself
it comes when you need it and the next
moment it is gone you understand it
is not that you must know the exact price
of each unmarked article it is that you
must be able to feel what it is worth

  even to one as ignorant of the ways of
trade as myself this reply was startling
however i held my peace and answered
with a polite yes msieu

  throughout her coaching of the night
before madame alcide had laid particular
stress upon the fact that in all matters per-
taining to his business the storekeeper was
wholly impervious to argument

  having made the round of the store
monsieur bonnemaison went out to the
porch where he promptly lowered himself
into the broad cane-seated chair which in
warm weather he was wont to occupy dur-
ing his moments of leisure here he sat
smiling and staring out over the road while
i watched him from the doorway in an
ever increasing agony of helplessness

  and what must i do now msieu i
finally burst out when i could stand it n
longer

  again monsieur bonnemaisons eyes ex-
pressed a species of quiet astonishment

  why wait upon the customers of
course he replied and returned to his
smiling and staring

  utterly demoralized i stumbled back in-
side where i wandered aimlessly from one

henshaw

counter to another all along i had
thought monsieur bonnemaison peculiar
now it appeared that he was undeniably
mad and here i was expected to look
after the madmans customers

  having never made a sale in my life i
was further handicapped by my complete
ignorance of the prices and disposition of
the stock in trade i could only wait in
impotent despair for the customers to come
along

  when however the customers made
their appearance my difficulties vanished
in a wholly unexpected manner at that
early hour the demand was solely for sup-
plies for flour and sugar and coffee com-
modities of which i knew the prices by
heart to my delight i found that having
unearthed the stock of groceries i had only
to weigh out to wrap up to hand over my
ill-bound packages and receive the money
in exchange for them as for salesmanship
i discovered that it played no part in the
disposal of these simple necessities

  no jean monsieur bonnemaison ob-
served afterward if your supplies are
good they will sell therriselves why
waste your breath upon a bag of flour
when all the time its praises are being sung
by the voice of hunger

  thus the first few hours passed success-
fully enough although i was continually
obsessed by the thought of what must oc-
cur when finally a customer demanded mer-
chandise but even here my fears were
groundless for when in due course this
dreaded eventuality arrived the problem
was solved by monsieur bonnemaison him-
self escorting his customer inside the
storekeeper conducted the sale while i
following his directions took down and dis-
played the goods

  throughout the morning this same pro-
cedure was observed though never once did
monsieur bonnemaison inquire the wants
of his patrons rather he seemed always to
know them beforehand rising promptly as
this one came into view allowing that one
to pass inside with only a nod and a word
of greeting

  when at noon i hurried off to my dinner
i had decided that my employer was not
quite so mad as i had thought him to be
indeed i could now find a certain method
in his procedure

  all this i confided to madame alcide
who followed my recital with an air of

       - romance
jean trouve

amused yet sympathetic understanding
evidently she had been prepared for these
peculiarities upon the part of my employer

  that is all right jean said she stick
it out and you will see bonnemaison is
far from being a madman

  the afternoon proved a repetition of the
morning often  made mistakes but i
gained a knowledge of the stock of which
i felt that i had some right to be proud
having put up the shutters i lingered
about in hopes that my employer would
comment on my progress but monsieur
bonnemaison appeared thoroughly unap-
preciative

  with the closing of the store he retired
to the small railed-off space in the rear
which did duty as an office here having
warned me to be on time the following
morning he promptly lost himself in the
engrossing occupation of counting the days
receipts

  throughout the week that followed
monsieur bonnemaison maintained this
pervefse silence i worked hard learning
the stock and mastering quite a respectable
number of prices yet for all my pains i
received not so much as a single word of
commendation

  true upon all other subjects my em- 
ployer was affability itself in our leisure
moments he discussed an endless variety of
topics yet once let me lead up to the
question of my progress and he would at
once discover some matter that demanded
his immediate attention

  in the end i became thoroughly exas-
perated through my life on the marsh i
had become used to a system of frank criti-
cism or approval i arrived at a state
where it would have been a relief had the
storekeeper condemned my efforts and sent
me away

  and then when having closed up the
seventh night i was about to hurry off
monsieur bonnemaison called me back into
his little office from his pocket he took
five silver dollars clinking them suggest-
ively as he passed them out to me across
the railing

  your wages jean said he they are
not bad for the woods even though i who
am paying them say it

  he paused and after i had waited to
make sure that nothing else was forthcom-
ing i mumbled my thanks in a voice dull
with disappointment

  well he questioned answering my
tone and is it not enough

  ah yes msieu i answered

only-

  i broke off while his smile expanded in
a chuckle of amusement

  only you would like a little word of
praise eh he finished for me well
you shall have it for you have most cer-
tainly earned it you have done well
jean so well that having put you to a test
i have gone to the trouble of continuing it
you are honest you are industrious you
are pleasant you learn fast

  but all these are as nothing compared
to the great essential of patience that
you have it i am assured and for it you
must thank the training of the marsh
there as you know well rash haste spells
either ill luck or disaster

  that first day you amazed me it
seemed incredible that you should await
the customers without complaint or ques-
tion afterward i kept on letting you
learn for yourself it is a good way jean
the lessons are never forgotten

  take for example the matter of the
prices you laughed to yourself when i
said that one did not keep them in ones
head that they came and went now you
see that i was right so continue your
patience jean and trust me to know what
is best in that way we will get on to-
gether

  he fell silent and on the instant he be-
came the bland inscrutable monsieur
bonnemaison of a while before

  and so good night he ended abruptly
i must finish and go home

  after this there was never between mon-
sieur bonnemaison and myself so much as
a shadow of misunderstanding true he
continued peculiar and secretive hiding
eternally behind his smile but never again
did i find him lacking in appreciation

  thus when in the second week a trapper-
friend stopped by for a pack of tobacco
and at my solicitation laid in his whole
stock of supplies monsieur bonnemaison
was not only prompt with his praise but
he even hinted at future advancement

  that is good jean said he always
has that one bought his stores at the bridge
you are beginning a new trade which if
continued will put money into your pocket
as well as mine

  by the end of the month all had fallen

        romance
	nevil g henshaw

out as madame alcide had predicted even
to monsieur bonnemaisons acceptance of
my title of clerk he came to it slowly
with a vast deal of muttered argument to
which i for one paid little heed this i
knew was the storekeepers way always
he obscured with outward pettiness the
inner shrewdness that had won his success

chapter iv

the convent

now that i had found regular employ-
ment the time passed quickly enough
at bois berard almost before i realized
it the summer was gone

  one month we were in the midst of hot
weather-fierce blazing weather-in which
the wood-folk drowsed away the long
bright hours beneath the leafy canopy of
the forest in which the very birds sought
cover during the midday glare in which
travelers inbound gulped the shade in
long thankful gasps their eyes all strained
and blood-shot from the gauzy dancing
heat-waves of the prairie the next fall
had arrived-the brief busy fall of the
mainland

  now as upon the marsh there came
from all sides a vast and incessant stir of
endeavor in the woods the furred crea-
tures scurried furtively about strengthen-
ing their defenses of food and lair against
the onslaught of winter above them the
birds flitted unceasingly shrilling their in-
dignation against the first of the invading
hoards of wax-wings and robins

  at the settlement the wood-folk bestirred
themselves as from a long sleep sharpening
their axes reaching down their moss-hooks
slipping away upon the various ventures
that would see them through cold weather

  and beyond in the wide fertile stretch
that rimmed the prairie the very loafers
rose unbidden to face three months of
feverish labor for the cane was ripe the
mills stood ready and throughout the land
had rung the magic call to grinding

  at the store we were busy enough our-
selves in outfitting this new-born industry
often we worked late in the uncertain light
of the swinging lamps so that i would re-
turn home utterly weary through the end-
less handing out of goods and supplies
then one night when i sat down to a be-

lated supper there came an event which i
had all but forgotten in the rush of the

season

  you will need a day off next week
said madame alcide in the brusk tone with
which she always heralded an unpleasant
announcement you had best warn bon-
nemaison in the morning

  but why madame i questioned
puzzled by the request at such a time

  madame alcide answered with a name

   toinette said she shortly

  it is the convent jean explained
toinette herself it opens on tuesday of
course you will wish to drive us in and so
see the last of me

   of course i replied and after that my
supper went untasted 

  toinette going away now that i
viewed it squarely the idea seemed pre-
posterous why i had come to the woods
for the sole purpose of being with toinette
and here she was going on tuesday to be
gone at best until the following summer

  of course i had known that she was to
go but it had all been vague something
that i had thought of as existing in the far-
distant future and now it had occurred
swiftly almost unexpectedly like some sud-
den disaster

  toinette i cried aghast you must
not go i can not get on without you

  ah yes but you can she teased in
less than a week you will have forgotten me
entirely

  then realizing the genuineness of my
dismay she changed at once hurrying
around the table to comfort me

  come jean she soothed it will be
all right at the camp perhaps it would
have been hard here you will find it very
different

  afterward i thought often of toinettes
words for through them she caused me for
the first time to consider the change in our
relationship now i realized that it was
not with us as it had been upon the marsh
there the tie had been absolute we had
been partners sharing each deed each
thought each word in our struggle against
the wild between us there had been no
special distinction our tasks had been
performed by one or the other according
to the necessity of the moment

  at bois berard all this had been
changed from the first day of our arrival
with madame alcide marriage was the one

d - -	romance
jean trouve

possible partnership between the sexes
thus toinette and i now shared only our
hours of leisure hours which through my
work at the store had come to mean meal-
times and the brief space between supper
and bed

  that this was as it should be i fully ap-
preciated yet whenever i considered my
present attitude toward toinette it seemed
somehow to savor of neglect

  accordingly i did my best to make it up
to her in the time before her departure pay-
ing her countless small attentions bringing
her the choice of monsieur bonnemaisons
stock of trinkets and fancy articles of dress
all this toinette accepted with a delight
which caused me to redouble my efforts

  but it is too much jean she would
protest i shall be so spoiled that the
good sisters will refuse to take me

  madame alcide vastly occupied in pre-
paring toinettes simple wardrobe viewed
my efforts with an air of amused under-
standing

  it was really funny jean she said to
me long afterward no you were not
stupid that is the way with you men
it is only when you wholly misunderstand
such things that you imagine you know
everything about them

  in the matter of the day off i found
monsieur bonnemaison all complaisance
of course i must go also i must use his
horse an animal renowned for its gentle-
ness and speed

  but here madame alcide interposed an
objection it was a family affair she de-
clared and it must be carried out in proper
fashion she would as soon think of leav-
ing poussard behind as to refuse the ser-
vices of her faithful achille

  accordingly early tuesday morning the
four of us set out behind the old horse and
plodded interminably across the prairie
until late in the forenoon we arrived at st
pierre here we drove at once to the con-
vent a tall square many-pillared build-
ing set snugly amid a grove of live oaks
upon the far bank of the bayou that bor-
dered the town

   and here we left toinette with the sisters
of mount carmel who at once shut her in
behind the barrier of their spreading stiffly
starched head-dresses as if in immediate
evidence of their determination to shield
her henceforth from the profanations of the
world

- rom

  the parting was brief so brief in fact
upon the part of madame alcide and my-
self as to suggest a grave doubt of self-
control

  good-by toinette i gulped my mind
a chaos of the things that i had planned to
say upon the drive and had until then
wholly forgotten

  be patient muttered madame alcide
as she stooped for her farewell kiss it is
the best way

  adieu mademoiselle said doctor
poussard with his best military bow

  and toinette smiling bravely despite
her brimming eyes could only keep re-
peating good-by jean good-by tante
aurore good-by msieu le docleur until
we had passed out of the dim formality of
the convent parlor and the heavy front
door had swung to behind us

  afterward we crossed back to the town
where having made achille comfortable at
a livery-stable madame alcide departed
upon a shopping-expedition leaving the
doctor and i to wander miserably about the
streets until such time as our ancient steed
was fit to travel again

  we returned almost in silence and en-
tered a house that for me was sadly remin-
iscent of my last visit to the hut at bayou
portage toinette had spoken truly then
i told myself for a time at least mad-
ame alcides comfortable home would be
no more to me than a box of boards

  if i brooded upon this during supper i
was not long allowed the luxury of my self-
pity once the meal was over and the
dishes cleared away madame alcide pro-
duced from among her various purchases
a square heavy package done up in thick
paper i had noticed this package lying
with the rest in the back of the surrey and
had speculated mildly upon its probable
contents

  now on its being opened i found that it
contained a half-dozen books they were
fat scholarly books very sober and busi-
ness-like and they seemed perfectly to
express madame alcides attitude as she
spread them out before me

  for you she explained or rather
for us since you are to read from them
each night after supper

  yes madame said i thinking that i
understood then it will not be so hard
for us about toinette

  the old ladys look became grim


nevil g hens haw

   on the contrary she returned then
perhaps it will not be so hard for toinette
about ourselves

   she paused for a moment as if to give
weight to her words and then went on
you see jean it is this way each day
now toinette will go forward while we
stand still once she has made her start
she will go fast and we with our duties
can not hope to keep up with her there-
fore we can only try by means of these
books to limp along as best we can

   perhaps this may appear as nonsense
to you now but later on you will see that i
am right at all events i mean to keep my
ears open to what you read i would not
like to have toinette come back and find
her old aunt behind her in every way

   so spoke madame alcide and be it said
to my credit that i was able at once to
understand for of the books one dealt
with agriculture in general and another
with the growing of cane in particular sub-
jects as far removed from the curriculum of
the good sisters as they were from the ne-
cessities of madame alcide herself

   and with understanding came apprecia-
tion not only of all that madame alcide
meant to do for me but of the exquisite
tact and kindliness with which she had set
forth her plans

  madame i muttered at a loss for
words you are too good to me

   the old lady nodded approvingly as a
virtue quickness of perception ranked high
in her esteem

   bwn jean that is all right said
she did you not begin by teaching
toinette the score is far from being
settled i assure you tomorrow we will
start

   after this i read aloud each night while
madame alcide sewed and listened and
shot me brief comments during the pauses
at first it was hard after the long round at
the store but later as my interest in-
creased it became for me the most pleasant
hour of the day

   also i learned picking up many bits of
agriculture of history of mythology each
of them spiced with the brisk yet mellow
knowledge of madame alcides long and
busy life she had wisdom as well as
knowledge had madame alcide and many
of her comments remain with me although
the lessons that inspired them have been
long forgotten

  in particular i remember her words in
the pause that followed the death of my
beloved hero msieu lempereur na-
poleon

  a great man jean she observed yet
i can not help but think that your way is
best is it not finer to bring live things
out of the ground than to put dead men
into it

  so the winter passed with its work its
saving its efforts upon the part of madame
alcide to continue my neglected education
christmas brought disappointment for at
the approach of the feast madame alcide
announced that toinette would not return

  it would be a break and breaks were
disastrous she declared toinette had
much to learn that only the unbroken
round of daily habit could teach

  thus i spent rather a lonely day which
began with mass at pere parmentiers little
prairie church and ended in my returning
at dusk from a long hunt upon the near-by
marsh

   then came the spring a wondrous fairy-
like spring far removed from the drab
rebirth of the marsh-a spring of myriad
tender leaves alight and quivering against
the wind-swept scatter of the sunshine

  and then even as i marveled at the
glory of the woods summer arrived bring-
ing toinettes return

chapter v

toinette comes home

having learned that toinette would
finish her term upon a wednesday
early in june madame alcide departed the
monday before she intended to visit cer-
tain relatives in st pierre and she was
further determined to miss no single detail
of the convents closing-exercises

  of course it will be the usual thing
said she they will recite and pound
upon the piano but that is not the point
toinette will play her part and in playing
it will show me what she has accomplished
i will know perfectly well how far she has
gone before i am back again

  accordingly madame alcide departed
alone behind achille leaving me to three
days of desolation in her empty house
true i did not lack entirely for company
jean tr ouve

as doctor poussard came over for a brief
visit each night

  whether this was due to the request of
madame alcide or to the promptings of
his own kindly nature i do not know but
from the first the little doctor gave evi-
dence that he would prove anything but a
cheerful companion

  usually silent his reticence was of the
sort that needed but a friendly word to
bring forth the true quality of his amiabil-
ity just now however he preserved a
puzzled muteness that was touched with a
faint hint of injury

  to one less observant than myself the
cause of this would have been plain even
had he denied himself the comfort of an
occasional fragment of speech

  a convent now jean he observed the
first night naturally it is no place for
men

  later he muttered

  just the same st pierre is not all con-
vent it is also a town as every one knows
quite well

  and in leaving he said wholly to him-
self his eyes turned toward the empty
stable-

  i could at least have looked after
achille

  poor doctor poussard he understood
perhaps but he could not reconcile himself
to the situation the convent might be
wholly a feminine affair yet it established
a most unwelcome precedent it was not
easy for him to look into the future

  thus it was with a very dejected doctor
that i set out along the wood-road upon the
afternoon of toinettes return knowing
the ways of achille i had delayed our de-
parture until sunset yet even then we had
waited long and twilight had set in before
we caught the surreys dark bulk against
the dim misty reach of the prairie

  you are there jean called madame
alcide as we hurried forward

  at your service madame cried the
doctor before i could even attempt an
answer

  poussard i have missed you came
back the reply next time convent or no
convent you will go along

  through the dusk i could see the relief
in the little doctors face then i was
abreast of the surrey and a slender vibrant
figure had sprung down into my waiting
arms

  jean jean cried toinette clutching
me in a way that brought back the bear-
hug of papa ton it is so good to see
you to be home again it did not seem so
long while i was away but now i know
that it was a hundred years

  if in the days of waiting i had harbored
uncertain half-formed doubts as to this
meeting they were set at rest by thfe first
touch of toinettes reaching hands there
had been no change i told myself she
was the same toinette of the year before

  later as we went along in the back of
the surrey i decided that there had been a
change-a change for the better this
eager chattering toinette was not the
toinette of bois berard rather she
was the old toinette of the marsh the
bright elusive toinette who had vanished
that cruel night at bayou portage

  if i slammed monsieur bonnpmaisons
shutters in closing up a while later it was
only through the sheer exultation of my
thoughts if after the last bolt was shot
i raced all the way to madame alcides it
was only because i lacked a swifter means
of progress and then when i had thrown
open the door and come into the lamplight
i found still another toinette-a toinette
of whom i could guess little save that she
was different

  that she was taller that her dress had
been lengthened that she had done some-
thing to her hair which caused her to ap-
pear no longer a small girl i saw at a
glance all this had been denied me by the
dusk yet in a way i had expected it

  it was some inner deeper change sensed
rather than seen that checked my rising
spirits with a touch of slow bewilderment
dimly i realized that the vivid creature of
a while before had been born solely of the
excitement of our meeting

  later when toinette had left the room
upon some errand madame alcide ex-
plained it all in a few crisp sentences

  you see jean said she she is not
sure yet she is finding her way but i
have seen the exercises and i know that it
is all right next year it will be different

  that was it i told myself and from the
moment i ceased my puzzling for after
all toinette was toinette which was
enough for any one besides if she was
not sure of herself how could i possibly
hope to understand her

  ah jean she would cry when speak-

romance
i

	nevl g

ing of the convent there is so much to
do so much to learn sometimes i think
that i had best been left with the other
wild creatures of the marsh but it is not
that i am unwilling to do my part i
would like to learn it all

  in proof of this she insisted upon a con-
tinuance of the nightly reading which we
had determined to abandon during hot
weather she must have her share of our
own particular learning she declared also
it would be like old times to have me teach
her as a consequence i kept on with my
books while madame alcide frankly sur-
rendering to the heat of the lamp dozed
upon the gallery in the fond belief that she
was listening through the opened window

  then the reading over we would slip
past the old lady to stroll about in the cool
of the starlight talking of the days at
bayou portage

  yet for all the gossip about the store i
could give toinette little news of the camp
le bossu had spoken truly in his farewell
and thus far i had seen nothing of our
friends upon the marsh

  true toinette and i had planned to
visit them but this proved impossible in
summer the camp was abandoned with
cool weather came the convent my busy
season at the store

  of le bossu himself i had heard from
time to time since the little man was well
known upon the mainland through the
past season he had trapped and hunted
along the vermilion now he was upon
the bay from where he had sent a message
that we would see him before he went back
to his traps again

  and so upon a long-remembered morn-
ing in mid-summer the little man made
good his promise coming to the woods for
a whole day it was a sunday chosen in
view of my duties and from noon until
sunset toinette and i plied our visitor with
questions about the marsh

  he had seen them all had le bossu
he had even put in at the camp deserted
now by all save old pierre the lasalles
were on the mainland young pierre was
busy with the fishing the partners me-
thodical as usual were established for the
summer at anse le vert all had sent us
words of greeting all had rejoiced at our
good fortune

  they are proud of you two declared
le bossu  what jean with bonne-

henshaw

maison and toinette at the convent they
said to me that speaks well for bayou
portage 

  in return we told the little man of our-
selves eager for his never failing sympathy
and understanding toinettes fears he
dismissed with a snap of his fingers

  it will go like that-this uncertainty
he declared it is all right now my little
toinette only you do not know it it is
not fear to realize the difficulties of an un-
dertaking it is good sense and with that
all things are possible

  of my own success he seemed equally as-
sured speaking to me quite frankly of his
hopes once we were alone together

  it is what i expected jean said he
the cane is in your blood and only when
you have grown it and seen it go into the
mill will you be satisfied not a little crop 
but the great one that is your due

  your work at the store your few acres
upon the prairie they are but little things
leading up to a big one only on the hill-
top out there will you find what you are
after

  for once you are wrong bossu i de-
clared what i told you that night on the
marsh i meant and will always mean

  the little man smiled cryptically

  bien he returned we shall see

  it was only when he was upon his way
and toinette and i were bidding him fare-
well at the rim of the prairie that le bossu
spoke of papa ton

  you thought that i had forgotten him
he questioned ah no for he has been
with us all day and that was best had
we spoken of him we would have been sad
and he hated sadness we have been
happy in the thought of him

  and one thing more this season i
will again be on the vermilion and with
warm weather i have planned to go back
to the swamps my old home perhaps i
will not see you for long and i would say
a word before i leave

  you are going up you two far far up
beyond any hope papa ton may have had
of you thus you may look back to him
some day and see only a rough old man
as careless in ways as in speech should you
do this say to yourselves that is not
papa ton it is papa ton as he would be
now perhaps but not as he was always
remember this it is what he was that

  our protestations he dismissed with a
smile

  that is all right said he i know
how you feel but you are young and some-
times we are tricked by our thoughts for
the rest just think of papa ton as being
on the marsh he is there i tell you just
as much now as before

  then he bade us good-by and departed
nor did i see him again for many a day
his stay in the swamps was a long one and
upon his return it was my misfortune to
miss him on his infrequent journeys across
the prairie

  yet the memory of his visit remained
and as we returned in the gray and gold of
the afterglow toinette spoke to me of the
simple peace that the little mans words
had brought her

  it was good to see bossu said she
it was good to hear him and best of all
was what he said at parting always be-
fore when i thought of papa ton there
was a hurt-a hurt so great that i could
not speak of him

  now the hurt is gone bossu was right
papa ton is still on the marsh it would
not be the marsh without him

  after this we spoke often of the big
man treasuring his deeds of love and kind-
ness and with the peace of this came the
old happiness-the happiness of perfect
understanding

  once more we were partners toinette
and i sharing our hoard of memories if
before le bossus visit the weeks had
passed quickly they now flashed by with a
most disconcerting swiftness hardly it
seemed had i begun to know toinette be-
fore fall was at hand and preparations
were going forward for her return to the
convent

  it would have been a trying time for me
but foj the rush of the season and its con-
sequent effect upon my employer we sold
much that year so much that considering
his depleted stock monsieur bonnemaison
arrived at a wholly unexpected determina-
tion always before he had ordered his
goods by letter from new orleans or from
the dealers at st pierre now he decided
that he would branch out a little

  i will go to the city for the new stock
jean said he quite abrutly one night
you are here to look after things and the
change will be good for me then i will
get new ideas i will see what i am buying

 o uv e		

before i buy it they are sharp those
city-folk often they have fooled me
bicn for once they will have to do with
n bonnemaison in person

   all this of course was very gratifying
to be left in charge was the highest com-
pliment possible upon the part of my em-
ployer nevertheless i viewed monsieur
bonnemaisons departure with an ever in-
creasing uneasiness

  for the woods the store was an imposing
affair and its management involved a most
uncomfortable responsibility when finally
toinette returned to st pierre with mad-
ame alcide and the triumphant poussard
her going was made easier by the problem
that lay before me

  a week later monsieur bonnemaison an-
nounced the morning of his departure and
in the days that followed his going proved
a source of endless discussion and specula-
tion of course being both cajun and
human monsieur bonnemaison had more
than once surrendered to the seductions of
the carnival but in the eyes of bois berard
this particular journey was fraught with a
strange yet very genuine importance

  they will be something those new
goods said the inhabitants we shall
have a christmas to remember

  the psychology of this is perhaps best
explained in the words of monsieur bonne-
maison himself

  it is not the goods but the manner of
their purchase said he when i asked him
about it take for example a knife or-
dered by me from st pierre and sold to
hulin the hunter if asked where he got
it he will reply at bonnemaisons and
the matter is ended

  but let hulin go himself to st pierre
and buy the same knife from the same
store and you will observe a difference
now he will stop each acquaintance to
show the knife and hold forth upon its
merits

    how is that for a blade he will ask
no it is none of bonnemaisons stuff i
bought it myself at st pierre

  thus it is the same with these goods
from the city they can not go hulin and
the rest it is impossible therefore the
next best thing is to have me go for them

  watch hulin when he buys his next
knife for a week he will carry it about in
his hand

    here is a real blade for you he will

 n c e


nevil g henshaw

say to every one this is no st pierre
pot-metal i can tell you bonnemaison
bought it for me himself in the city 

  it was in the manner of his final instruc-
tions however that monsieur bonne-
maison displayed his true knowledge of
human nature he did not frighten me
with useless commands he did not con-
fuse me with trilling detail only in the
matter of the mail which was brought in
each day from the prairie and which he
regarded with an awe closely bordering
upon reverence did he warn me to be par-
ticularly careful

  to me you can explain a mistake jean
to the government never he admon-
ished and the government is the law
it is the one thing that you must re-
member

  for the rest he merely told me to keep
on as usual an injunction that increased
my confidence a thousandfold as a conse-
quence the day of his departure found me
divided between my regret at his leaving
and my desire to show him how well i
should do

  au revoir jean said he when his
buggy was before the store and valise in
hand he had come out of his tightly closed
house in five days a week perhaps i
shall be back again yes i will remember
to look for your madame therese al-
though from what you have said i fear
that it is hopeless no i have nothing to
tell you you are in charge now and it is
for you to say what shall or shall not be
done

  this last spoken loudly was for the
benefit of the small crowd that had
gathered to see him off a chuckling mut-
tering crowd from which exploded every
now and then some witticism concerning
the probable antics of an old man upon
being faced with the perils and temptations
of the city

  all this monsieur bonnemaison took in
good part shaking hands right and left and
making the most extravagant promises as
to what he would order for each particular
one then climbing into his buggy he
waved his hand and was driven off amid a
shouting of farewells

  when he had vanished beyond the trees
i reentered the store with a feeling almost
of satisfaction that the responsibility was
great i still realized but thanks to mon-

sieur bonnemaisons attitude i now felt
fully capable of accepting it

  as we sold only for cash and i knew the
stock by heart i had only to open and close
the store and wait upon such customers as
came along after all it was very simple

  true certain shiftless folk scenting their
chance approached me with tales of press-
ing need and of various employments that
would fill their empty pockets by the end
of the week however i not only knew
them well but i also understood perfectly
how to deal with them having tried me
out they did not trouble me again

  in one case only did i make an excep-
tion of doctor poussards dealing with
the establishment i knew nothing as he
had always transacted his business with
monsieur bonnemaison himself now
when he came to me for his meager sup-
plies telling of a mattress that would cer-
tainly be finished and paid for in a few
days i served him without question

  his relief was as pitiful as it was sincere

  i thank you jean he quavered it
would not have been nice to have had my
credit impaired and now if you wish i
will stay a while coming back from time
to time i can do nothing perhaps but i
will be here in case of need

 poor doctor poussard the courage
with which he had steeled himself against
a possible refusal must have been great
indeed now in proof of his gratitude he
offered me the one remaining possession
of his company

  thus i came to know the little doctor
well and in knowing him i was impressed
more each day by the marvelous comfort
of his society never have i known such a
companion as doctor poussard as mad-
ame alcide declared he was only there
when you had need of him

christmas

in six days monsieur bonnemaison was
back again he arrived quite unex-
pectedly driving out in a hired buggy and
entering the store with as little ceremony
as if he had merely stepped over from his
home indeed i thought him a customer

until his quiet well here i am jean
brought me hurrying forward in welcome

  later after he had looked about he
spoke briefly of his journey he had had
good luck with his buying also he had
enjoyed himself he had seen many new
and wonderful things and it was always
interesting to watch the crowds of mad-
ame therese he had inquired carefully but
to no avail she was already forgotten
upon the rue bourbon

  finally he could see that i had done
well and in expectation of this he had
brought me a little gift it was a watch
and if i was pleased with it i might con-
sider my thanks as already said

  nothing could have been more typical
of monsieur bonnemaison than his attitude
upon this occasion had any other in-
habitant of bois berard returned from such
an outing the recital of his adventures
would have been a matter of mouths
true the visit had impressed monsieur
bonnemaison as was evidenced by the
manner in which he commented upon it
it was his habit when interested to smile
and talk glibly upon all subjects save the
particular one that occupied his attention

  his treatment of the wood-folk was a
marvel of diplomacy when they hurried
in eager for each detail of his journey he
replied that he had had a good time and
then plunged into a description of the forth-
coming -goods that drove all other thoughts
from their minds thus he satisfied the
public curiosity until with the arrival of
the goods themselves the incident was con-
sidered closed

  they caused much excitement those
goods chosen carefully they lived up to
and even beyond the reputation established
beforehand by their purchaser once they
had been hauled out from the railroad we
enjoyed a trade such as monsieur bonne-
maison himself had not expected

  women came from the farthest limits of
the prairie for bonnets for dress-goods for
the innumerable flashy trinkets with which
we added life and color to the more solid
merits of our display that winter to be
a la mode was to have bought ones outfit
of bonnemaison

  with the men it was merely a matter of
taking down an article to have it accepted
at once that often it was the duplicate
of a similar article recently bought made

  no difference the magic of from the
city swept all doubts aside

  it was while we were at the very height
of our success that news came to us of
approaching competition with the fail-
ure of gilbeau its proprietor more than a
year before the little shop at the end of
the settlement had remained closed and for-
gotten now we heard that it would be
opened again and by no less a person than
my old enemy monsieur dugas

  upon receiving this intelligence mon-
sieur bonnemaison merely added a shrug
to his smile but later he displayed what
was for him a truly remarkable ill-humor

  it is too bad he exploded once we
were alone it is worse than too bad it
is a nuisance of course i had expected
it he has tried every place but here
just the same he can hardly interfere
with us i answered trying to draw him
out so long as the city goods last the
trade will be ours

  my effort was wholly successful for
the first time since i had known him mon-
sieur bonnemaisons small pensive eyes
were touched with a glint of anger

  come jean this is no time to joke
said he shortly knowing dugas as you
do you understand well what i mean of
course you will advise me to stop him at
once but that is impossible he will come
with a small stock of supplies and for a
while there will be nothing to lay your
finger on it will all be hidden in that
lean-to at the back only when trouble
comes can we oust him and then it will
be too late

  but why i questioned what is the
use in going on that way

  monsieur bonnemaison spread out his
hands

  it is the man he replied perhaps
he is mad who can say at all events it
is his one desire the thing that he lives
for as a merchant even as the keeper of
a decent coffee-house he would be a suc-
cess he is a close bargainer and he
knows how to save

  but he is snot satisfied with honest
trade even the edge of the law is too
good for him then too he must always
play upon the weakness of another not only
for the gain but for the strange pleasure of
doing so

  you have seen the kind of man who
having started a toddling child will allow

it to blunder off the porch for his own
amusement that is dugas he is mean
he is cruel and always he whines when he is
made to pay for his sport the sooner he
is through here the better it will be for
every one

  two days later monsieur dugas de-
scended upon us he arrived in a battered
one-horse wagon half-filled with supplies
and having unloaded and haggled with the
driver he drove back with him as far as
monsieur bonnemaisons store here he
climbed over the wheel for what he was
pleased to call a friendly understanding

  as i looked at him i saw that the past
two years had used him ill he was thin-
ner he was more ragged and his cringe
now bent him almost double his meager
face bore a hunted look and beyond the
crooked twist of his furtive eyes one
glimpsed the weariness that is born of con-
stant dread

  he had come to explain he said in
opening up he had no intention or desire
of taking away any part of monsieur bonne-
maisons trade only let him serve the few
humbler folk who were bewildered by the
larger stores variety and assortment and
he would be satisfied for the rest he stood
ready to do anything that might advance
the prosperity of both places

  it was all fairly said but beyond the
words one sensed the true meaning of mon-
sieur dugas visit fully aware that his
reputation had traveled before him he had
come to find out just how much of this-
reputation was actually known

  bois berard though remote was within
easy reach of the law in this particular
undertaking the element of time would
prove a most important factor

  having heard his competitor out in cold
silence monsieur bonnemaison spoke
briefly and to the point

  the trade is yours if you can get it
dugas said he the woods are free to
all but mind that your business is car-
ried on in front that is all i have to
say

  and he added to me as without further
words monsieur dugas shambled off-
now that he knows he will work fast
it will not be long

  true to this prophecy monsieur dugas
pushed his secret business to the farthest
possible limit shunning our place after
that first visit lie worked feverishly striv-

  ing for the last penny that stood between
him and the inevitable disaster

  at the store we could only watch while
the blight of monsieur dugas sinister in-
fluence spread wider day by day in the
trade of those unfortunates upon whom the
storekeeper especially preyed was written
the whole story of their downfall

  first they gave over the buying of
trinkets and non-essentials next they
denied themselves in the more important
matter of implements and dress and
finally as the vicious circle narrowed down
there came a stoppage of supplies telling
of hungry mouths left empty for the filling
of a bottle

  of monsieur dugas several victims the
most pitiful was hulin the hunter a
cheerful if intemperate soul he had been
contented with an occasional debauch upon
the prairie now at the height of the sea-
son he ranged the woods by day only that
he might spend his nights in carousing
soon his little ones went about pinched and
wary having in their eyes a wistful appeal
for the smile that had become a blow

  it was as intolerable as it was hopeless
more than once i visited monsieur dugas
in an effort to discover something to go
upon and always i found the same as-
sortment of unsold tins the half-sack of
moldy flour the pyramid of coconuts worn
smooth by age and much handling

  always the storekeeper received me with
a mock effusiveness that was maddening
i had come to buy no then perhaps

i	would sit down and accept a bottle of
rouge whereupon he would throw open
the door of the lean-to showing me that
it contained only his pallet and a treasured
crate or two of red pop

  he worked well this time did monsieur
dugas save the elect none saw so much
as the drawing of a cork had it been pos-
sible to raid him we would have had only
our trouble for our pains

  so i watched him uselessly until with
the approach of christmas i turned my
thoughts to the more pleasant prospect of
toinettes return this year she was to be
with us the best part of a week and when
she arrived two days before the feast i
greeted her with a gasp of consternation

  toiette i cried you have grown
up

  not yet jean she smiled it is only
my long dress also to please tante

- romance
je a n trouve



aurore i have piled my hair on top of my
head

  this was reassuring but even in those
few days i learned that toinettes growth
went far beyond the long dress and piled-
up hair if as she said she had not grown
up she had at least found herself of
this much i was sure even before madame
alcide confirmed it it was plain to see
in the steady untroubled look of her eyes
in the quiet decisiveness of her manner

  it is all right now at the convent i
asked her

  it is more than all right jean she re-
plied it is like another home

  that was a long-remembered christmas
with its presents from st pierre and the
store and its late monstrous dinner at-
tended not only by doctor poussard but
by my employer himself unaccustomed
though he was to dining out monsieur
bonnemaison did not lack in gallantry

  but this is fine madame he kept re-
peating between mouthfuls i did not
think that anything so good could come out
of my store

  to toinette he declared

  in your case mademoiselle the good
sisters have accomplished a triumph be-
sides teaching you they have made of you
a young lady such as these woods have
never seen

  dinner over and the day being mild we
sat out upon the gallery from where later
in the afternoon we heard sounds of dis-
turbance at the far end of the settlement
there were muffled shouts and snatches of
song followed always by the roar and
cackle of drunken laughter

  you hear said monsieur bonne-
maison dugas is getting bold either
he depends upon the good-will of the day
or he finds that he is near the end of his
rope

  perhaps it is the strangers ventured
doctor poussard at my place i saw
them come in from the marsh

  so answered monsieur bonnemaison
then it is worse than i feared they will
not be easy to handle those strangers once
they have had too much

  with the approach of dusk and the de-
parture of our guests the revelry increased
then shortly after dark it rose into a sud-
den furious outburst that was heard inside
the house scenting trouble i hurried out-
side to find that the uproar had been suc-

ceeded by a silence in which i caught very
faintly the thud and rustle of swiftly de-
parting feet then as i quickened my pace
there shrilled out upon the night the high
thin wail of a woman in fear

  at monsieur dugas i found all that i
had sought so long grown bold the
strangers had wrecked the place leaving it
a chaos of empty bottles and scattered sup-
plies the windows were smashed the
door had been wrenched away and in-
side amid the litter of broken glass and
trampled food lay hulin his chest a dark
welter of blood

  to those who gathered about him he
could only explain that he had been
stabbed there had been a general fight
in which the lights had been knocked over
and knives had come into play

  when struck he had screamed where-
upon all had rushed out bursting so it
seemed through the very walls at the
time he had been the only inhabitant pres-
ent long before the others had been
scared away

  so ended monsieur dugas venture at
bois berard for escaping with the
strangers the storekeeper disappeared
had hulins wound proved serious he
would have been searched for but when
after a few days the hunter recovered from
the wound in his shoulder the wood-folk
were content to let well enough alone

  bien they said hulin is out and we
are rid of dugas for all time we should
not complain

  in the excitement following monsieur
dugas flight toinettes visit passed
quickly it seemed that she came that
hulin was wounded that she was gone
again all in a few hours only after she
had driven away did i realize how little i
had seen of her	

  yet for all this i now became possessed
of a thought of toinette such as i had not
entertained before it began with a chance
remark of monsieur bonnemaisons

  i miss her your mademoiselle said he
one day it was good to see her about
where before she was pretty she is now
beautiful

   that is so i agreed idly but five min-
utes later monsieur bonnemaisons words
had taken complete possession of my mind

  was toinette beautiful i asked my-
self was she even pretty to my amaze-
ment i found that it had never occurred to

r o m ance


n e v i l g

henshaw

me to consider the matter in any way
other girls pretty and plain i had noticed
and commented on of this phase of
toinette i had not thought at all i had
been satisfied with the mere fact of her
being toinette

  now thanks to my employer i discov-
ered that toinette was possessed of certain
looks of her own this much i grasped
at once but what of these looks here
was a riddle to which i could find no sat-
isfactory answer

  pursuing my inquiry i decided that i
could not depend upon my own judgment
viewing toinette with the eyes of affection
i must find her beautiful in every way of
course i had my employers opinion but
monsieur bonnemaison was ever a speaker
of fair words perhaps he had been chiefly
concerned with the memory of that christ-
mas dinner

  thinking on i dismissed doctor pous-
sard whose answer i already knew

  of course he would say as beauti-
ful as she is good

  here i was forced to stop since of the
other inhabitants there vvas not one whom
i would care to approach with so delicate
a question

  closing time found me obsessed by my
inquiry i felt that i could have no peace
until this question of toinettes looks was
definitely settled as i walked home i
considered an appeal to madame alcide
but in the end i shrank from the idea she
was a woman and she might not under-
stand

  after supper i read so absently that more
than once the old lady shot me an inquir-
ing glance above her sewing then the
reading over i could contain myself no
longer

  madame i burst out is toinette
beautiful

  as she looked quickly up madame al-
cides gaze was strangely hostile

  who has said so she demanded
sharply

  msieu bonnemaison i replied

  there fell a pause during which madame
alcide gave a little nod as was her habit
in moments of satisfaction

  so said she quietly and wht do
you think jean

  i can not think i answered that
is just the trouble

  vague though this was madame alcide
seemed fully to understand

  then do not try she advised if
you have not troubled about this before
why do so now

  and she added returning to her needle

  beauty is for outside jean in ones
home it is always uncomfortable

  later as we were closing up for the
night madame alcide broke in upon the
returned calmness of my thoughts with one
of her rare laughs

  what is it madame i inquired

  the old ladys smile held fondness to-
gether with its quaint humor

  it is you jean she returned you
are truly amusing not only have you
found out that toinette is a woman but
you have made the further remarkable dis-
covery that you yourself are a man

chapter vii

i approach my ambition

that spring i put in the first of my
cane it was a small planting of a
dozen acres yet having no work-animals
or implements of my own i was forced to
go into partnership with joe vital a mar-
ket-gardener who owned a team of the
forthcoming profits vital was to receive
one-half the balance would be divided
between madame alcide and myself as
the furnishers of the land and the seed-
cane

  this arrangement promised me scant
profits yet i was well satisfied next year
i would plant my own stubble and double
my crop also if i were successful i
would have proved the worth of my ex-
periment

  but best of all was the thought that i
approached my ambition at last i was
to reap the reward of those long months
of work and saving

  never will i forget that march morning
when vital turned up the first brown clods
of the prairie as they slid smoothly
over scattering their shower of dewdrops
i thought them the most wonderful clods
in all the world i could hardly have
valued them more had nature provided
true jewels for their adornment

  standing beside me madame alcide
voiced her approval

romance
jean trouve



   you have done it jean said she
 and in your own way

   what do you mean madame i ques-
 tioned

   with most of our folk the first plant-
 ing and even the last is done between the
 handles of a plow she returned it is
 not often that we can stand and look
 on

   but how could i learn to plow while
 in the store i objected

   before replying the old lady surveyed
 me with a look of quiet comprehension

   that is all right jean said she i
 understand i have understood all along
 that is what i meant when at the very
 first i told you that you aimed high

   after this i treasured my leisure mo-
 ments that i might spend them in watch-
 ing the work go on it fascinated me
 that lumpy irregular square which vital
 was creating at the edge of the woods
 each day it lapped farther beyond the
 rim of encroaching sod for all the world
 as if the prairie had been some huge placid
 lake upon which i had launched the frail
 bark of my endeavor

   then the plowing done the seed-cane
 went in until with the covering of the
 final joint vital withdrew a while leaving
 the torn earth to be quickened by the
 touch of nature

   yet even now i went each day to the
 field to dream of the myriad slender
 sprouts that would presently push up
 from the hidden eyes below those shoots
 would be stout and many i told myself
 they must be it was unthinkable that
 this first crop would prove a failure

  and next year there would be many
 more shoots and in the years to come more
 again until- but i could not go beyond
 that until it represented the height of
 my achievement whfin in their millions
 those final shoots stretched away beyond
 sight from the trees i would have reached
 my goal and become a planter

   at the store i talked of cane to each
 small farmer who came along gravely i
 discussed the effects of heat and cold of
 rain and drought more gravely still i
 heard of the curse of weeds the blight of
 the borer and the endless kindred evils
 against which one must guard an infant
 crop it was a time of fear as well as
 hope and often when i considered the
 vast malevolent forces against which i

must contend it seemed impossible that
i should ever succeed

  it was at these times that the sound
common sense of monsieur bonnemaison
made short work of my dejection

  pay no attention to those croakers
jean he would advise that is their
fun to scare the newcomer with all those
things of which they have ceased to be
afraid i am no farmer but i have no-
ticed that despite the bugs and weeds
the new crops come up each year yours
will do the same

  in the matter of my planting monsieur
bonnemaison was kindness itself he
wished me well and in return i saw to it
that this new interest did not diminish my
work at the store

  rather it increased it as it increased the
business for having aired their opinions
the small farmers came back from the
prairie to enlarge upon them next when
true to monsieur bonnemaisons predic-
tions my crop was safely above ground
they returned to view it and to instruct
me in those further efforts that would see
it through hot weather

  all of this brought trade-new trade
wholly unexpected as a consequence
monsieur bonnemaison developed an in-
terest in my venture beyond his mere
desire for my ultimate success

  i am surprized jean said he it is
bringing us out that little crop of yours
already it has done as much as the goods
from the city they are talking far out
in the prairie

   you have heard says one they
are putting in cane at bois berard so
says the other and turning his back on
those many acres about him he rides here
to see

  you have done well and next year
you must do better if necessary i shall
help you

  gradually the advent of these new-
comers worked a change upon the placid
existence of monsieur bonnemaison
where before he had been gratified by
their custom he now began to find an
interest in their presence he talked with
them he joked with them he expanded
visibly beneath their influence

  soon becoming tired of the eternal talk
of crops he took to discussing the no less
important topic of politics there would
be several elections that fall and already

 romance
nevil g

henshaw

the prairie-folk were considering the
nierits of the various candidates

  up to this time monsieur bonnemaisons
voting had been both blind and spasmodic
upon those occasions when the elections
had not interfered with his work he had
gone to the polls and cast his ballot in
accordance with the wishes of his friends

  now he discovered that he was entitled
to an opinion of his own nay more-
that if he would prove himself a good
citizen it was his duty to form such an
opinion and stick to it to the bitter end

  accordingly monsieur bonnemaison set
about to inform himself through the me-
dium of his neighbors beginning with
an occasional hurried drive to the stores
and homes of the prairie he extended his
visits until with the ending of spring it
was not uncommon for him to be absent a
whole afternoon

  his delight in this new occupation was
that of the toiler who having achieved
independence discovers that he still has
the desire and ability to play

  dieu jean he would say they are
something those politics where before
i had one friend i now have a dozen
and that is good for any one all along
i have been like a man in jail now
that i am free i mean to enjoy myself

  it was good to see monsieur bonne-
maison come out of his shell looking
on bois berard understood and ap-
plauded

  let him have his fun said the wood-
folk he has worked hard enough for
it

  and the wise ones added

  bonnemaison will play that game well
if we in all these years have failed to get
behind his smile how can those others
expect to do so

  what with my cane and monsieur bon-
nemaisons politics the spring passed
pleasantly with the coming of june
however i faced a bitter disappointment
shortly before she departed for the con-
vents exercises madame alcide informed
me that toinette would not return with
her

  upon her reasons for this decision ma-
dame alcide spoke at length toinette
was now grown she said and it was high
time that she knew her family there-
fore she would begin by visiting certain
lava is and berards in and around st

pierre afterward she would return to
the convent and employ such time as re-
mained of her vacation in preparing her-
self for her all-important third year

  madame alcide laid particular stress
upon that third year it was the one that
counted she declared let toinette pass
through it safely and she need not worry
about the fourth year and graduation of
course toinette was smart but she had
started late and with only my scant teach-
ing she could not afford to take chances

   it was all so simple and convincing that
i was at a loss to account for the man-
ner in which madame alcide dwelt upon
it she seldom repeated herself nor was
it often necessary for her to do so in
the end i decided that she was fortifying
herself against her approaching loneliness

  it was hard to have toinette miss my
first crop often at the camp when i
had spoken of my ambition she had
pointed out to the marsh-grass saying

  look jean your cane will be like
that some day

  and now that i had my cane-real
living growing canc-she was not there to
see  could only console myself with the
thought that next year she would behold
it in all the impressiveness of my increased
acreage

  so the summer came depriving me of
toinette yet bringing me new tasks that
did much to atone for her absence in
the field my cane was well up and thriv-
ing so that each spare moment found me
assisting vital in the work of cultivation
at the store my duties increased daily as
monsieur bonnemaison followed the in-
evitable course of his development urged
on by his friends he now fell a victim to
political ambition

   for years the ward of which bois berard
was a part had been represented upon the
police jury by general marsh there had
been no canvassing of votes no contest in
regard to this office as the leader of his
section the general had been chosen unani-
mously

  now he announced that following his
present term he could serve no longer
also he made no suggestion as to his
successor

   this returned the office to the realm of
politics true the election would not be
held for nearly a year but this merely
increased the possibilities of the situation

mce	zr

with so many months to work in the
prairie-folk could be depended upon to
conduct a campaign that would make po-
litical history

i as a consequence monsieur bonne-
maison departed from the first preliminary
skirmish to find himself a candidate his
friends had asked him to run and half-
bewildered he had given his consent

  that this bewilderment was due rather
to monsieur bonnemaisons modesty than
to any apprehension he might have felt at
the prospect of holding office became
quickly apparent once he had consid-
ered the matter and gotten his bearings
he fairly bubbled over with delight and
appreciation

  it is too much he declared to
think that i the beginner should be
chosen i could not answer when they
asked me i could only nod my agree-
ment and get away as quickly as possible
but i will show them if i get in pood
roads and safe bridges will speak for me

   following his elation monsieur bonne-
maison entered upon a more sober period
during which with the aid of his support-
ers he mapped out a campaign this ac-
complished he called me into his office
one evening as i was preparing to leave
the store

  next week i start my canvass he
began april is a long way off but dau-
trive has come out and it is said that
pesson will run also this means a fight
and in a fight it is often the first blow that
counts also having struck my blow i
mean to keep on striking until the very
day of the election thus you will be in
charge again jean this time for months
perhaps

   that is all right msieu said i you
can depend upon me to do my best

  monsieur bonnemaison waved this as-
surance aside

  of course jean said he that is
understood the question is how can i
do my best with your cane the store
will be too much even in summer you
must have some one to help you

  he paused leaving me fairly staggered
by his suggestion monsieur bonnemaison
with two clerks he was coming out
indeed

  that is good of you msieu said i
if i could have help on saturdays it

would be easier you have thought of
any one

  as he replied monsieur bonnemaisons
smile was touched with a fleeting kindness
-kindness not only for myself but for the
one he had in mind

  what of poussard he questioned
ever since my trip to the city he has been
hanging about if you are satisfied i will
speak to him

  thus it was arranged and upon the
following saturday the little doctor re-
ported for duty at the store so timidly
pleased so pitifully grateful was he that
even monsieur bonnemaison was touched
by the effect of his benevolence

  dieu jean he said to me i am
knowing poussard for the first time only
now can i appreciate how hard it has been
for him

  the truth of this i appreciated myself
in the weeks that followed it had been
hard for the little doctor far harder than
any of us would ever know to his lone-
liness his lack of true occupation had
been added a poverty that made a humili-
ation of the very food that went into his
mouth for doctor poussard had his
pride the fine pride of one who scorning
surrender accepts and fights on in the hope
of some day being able to repay

  in proof of this he refused to accept
even a portion of the small amount that
i offered him upon his first saturday night

  no jean he said it must go upon
my account as you perhaps know i have
an arrangement with your employer it
is good to pay back one can spend
money in no pleasanter manner

  once he had mastered the stock and
prices the little doctor proved an able
assistant always quiet and considerate
he performed his duties with all the thor-
oughness and precision of his military
training

  also he served his customers with a
grave courtesy hitherto unknown at our
establishment the wood-folk liked to be
waited upon by doctor poussard they
left him with a most gratifying estimate
of their own importance

  soon there arose a demand for him which
monsieur bonnemaison was only too will-
ing to satisfy accordingly with the ap-
proach of midsummer he offered the little
doctor a permanent place in the store

  never will i forget the manner in which

doctor poussard accepted his promotion
if before we had been touched by his
gratitude his joy and relief was now
enough to dim ones eyes perhaps that
period of uncertainty had been harder for
him than anything he had known

  now that he was sure the little doctor
was like a man transformed gone from
his eyes was the plaintive anxiety and
in its place came a look of peace through
pride his stooped shoulders regained a hint
of their former squareness touched by
the warm glow of prosperity his very
brownness took on a mellower hue

  his medicine and his mattresses he gave
up at once taking down his signs upon
the very afternoon of his talk with mon-
sieur bonnemaison

  you see jean it would not do for me
to retain these outside affairs he ex-
plained i could only attend to them by
neglecting the interests of my employer
thus my practise and my manufactory are
things of the past now that the signs
are down my patrons will understand that
i am done with them entirely

  good doctor poussard even in his
retirement he wrought a lasting cure upon
his most profitable patient for follow-
ing her enjoyment of his success madame
alcide achieved a state of health in which
her migraine entirely disappeared

  having established the little doctor
monsieur bonnemaison removed his activi-
ties to the store-porch he would be there
to advise and to greet the customers the
rest we could attend to inside now that
he had two clerks he would make the most
of them such time as was allowed him
by his supporters he meant to taka at his
ease

  so said monsieur bonnemaison and
so the word went round that when at
bois berard he could always be found
outside the store each day he held court
in his old armchair each day he talked
politics to an increasing audience smiling
his inscrutable smile

  and well might monsieur bonnemaison
smile for it was very hot and he had
solved the problem of his canvass where
before he had gone to the voters the
voters now came to him

  yet it was monsieur bonnemaisons ill
luck that of all these voters the most
important should call at a moment whan
he was away from the store thus the

 rom

henshaw

newcomer was received by doctor pous-
sard who called back to me in a voice
shrill with excitement

  quick jean he warned it is
msieu the general

  hurrying out  found the general upon
his horse at the edge of the porch since
coming to the woods i had caught sight
of him but always it had been from a
distance now that i saw him closely i
found him little changed

  the years might have added new lines
to his face-thin lines infinitely fine and
delicate as became one of his position
his hair might now be more white than
gray otherwise in his erectness his chill
aloofness he was the same forbidding
figure of that day of renunciation

  upon his part the general satisfied him-
self with a single glance in my direction
it was a brief glance accomplished by a
slight twist of the head yet so searching
so all-embracing was it that i felt as if i
had been stripped to the skin

  yes msieu  stammered conscious
that my face was aflame

  as he replied the generals gaze was
fixed upon the far end of the wood-road
he spoke straight before him as if he were
addressing some one who stood at the head
of his horse

  i wish to leave a message for bonne-
maison said he tell him that he may
count upon my support

  yes msieu i replied after i had
waited to make sure that he was through
msieu bonnemaison will be pleased
thank you said the general and pre-
pared to depart

  then as his horse swung out from the
porch he suddenly wheeled him back
again once more he looked at me but
this time there was nothing disturbing in
his gaze it passed through and beyond
me as if i were something wholly finished
and appraised

  i noticed some cane as i came in be-
gan the general

  it is mine msieu i answered

  you have a fine stand

  i am pleased that you think so msieu
  to whom do you expect to sell it
  to you msieu if you are willing
  the general reached for his bridle
  very well he agreed and ended the
  interview by trotting away amid the fast
  lengthening shadows of the trees

ince i----
jean trouve



  bien observed doctor poussard
speaking for this first time you are
lucky you and bonnemaison your wares
have found a good market

  this was true but at the moment my
thoughts were far from my crop i could
only recall that first glance of the generals
and wonder at what part it had played in
his unexpected visit

  i was flushed again as i reentered the
store somehow i felt as if i had been
on exhibition

chapter viii

the general makes an offer

thanks to a good season and the
fertility of the prairie my cane proved
a remarkable success all through the
summer it increased in girth and richness
until with the coming of fall a high close-
woven jungle of purple and green stood
out against the dark line of the forest

  once more the prairie-folk came to see
and congratulate they could not deny
that jungle even the most pessimistic
were forced to admit that i had done well

  at bois berard itself there was a diver-
sity of opinion some few inhabitants of
proved industry were frankly jubilant de-
claring that my good fortune would bring
a general prosperity their less thrifty
neighbors viewed the future more darkly

  what is money without comfort they
demanded

  to dig up the ground was hard work
especially in summer no one but a sim-
pleton would wish to exchange a gun for
a hoe if the planting kept on all sensible
folk would move farther inside

  nevertheless i did not lack for labor
when the time came to cut my crop bois
berard might grumble but it could be de-
pended upon to make the most of such an
occasion

  on the appointed day i had my pick of
the entire settlement the wood-folk fairly
fought for possession of the few cane-
knives that i had ordered from st pierre

  afterward they made a game of the
work some of them slashing in with the
abandon of one repelling an attack others
more delicately humored pretending to
engage in a duel with each separate stalk

this while fun for the onlookers meant

ruin to the cane had i not interfered
my crop would have been speedily reduced
to fragments

  later when the first cart was loaded
and vital had climbed aboard it the wood-
folk were outspoken in their pride

  show them what we are joe they
called remember you are not peddling
game at msieu the generals back door

  all along i had looked forward to the
moment when i would make this first jour-
ney to marsh island now that it had
arrived i found that i must forego my
small triumph in the first place i was
no handler of mules and would therefore
prove merely an additional burden to vital
or the others whom i had engaged to move
the crop in the second it was necessary
that i remain in the field to superintend
the work of the cutters

  vital must look after the weighing and
collect the receipts leaving me to make
the final settlement

  it was disappointing to wait for the last
loads but when they were ready i was
recompensed for my delay by the thought-
fulness of monsieur bonnemaison i must
use his driving-horse he declared not
only would it be more comfortable but i
would appear to better advantage

  after all i was a planter despite my
few acres it would not do for me to
arrive in a cart like any common laborer

  thus i set out in style trotting ahead of
my small cavalcade upon the broad back
of monsieur bonnemaisons animal the
day was crisp and clear and as i reached
the causeway a sudden breeze rippled in
from the bay spicing the air with a tang
of saltiness beneath its touch the tall
grass bowed gravely while the myrtles flut-
tered their tiny leaves as if in mockery
of such sedateness

  it was the same old marsh and the
sight of its waving grass brought back my
last afternoon at bayou portage poor
papa ton what if he could see me
now

  cane is for the rich jean he had said
only with a trap can you get your for-
tune out of the ground

  reaching the island i took a different
direction from the one adopted upon my
journey with monsieur dugas now i
turned off to the left along a road that
circled the base of a hill following this
through a tangle of woodland i came

romance
nevil g henshaw

 finally to open ground and here i drew
 up with a suddenness that brought a snort
 of protest from my indignant mount for
 the cane-fields lay before me

   long was i to remember my first view
 of these fields perhaps they were not as
 vast as those that encircled the great re-
 fineries of st pierre perhaps they lacked
 the network of rails the puffing dummies
 that made for modern efficiency yet in
 the wide free sweep of their level acres in
 the flood of green that billowed from
 marsh to hillside they expressed in the
 fullest degree all that for which i longed

    as i gazed at them i felt g great and
 tender pity for my father it was some-
 thing to have lost those fields no wonder
 he had been gray before his time

    riding on between the tall ranks of the
 cane i came presently to the mill a
 squat affair of brick and plaster topped by
 an ancient stack from its low-pitched
 shed came the rich heavy odor of the open
 kettles about its narrow carrier the cane
 was piled in huge glistening mounds in-
 side its worn rollers clanked and rattled as
 if in wean effort while they crunched their
 way through the never ceasing stream of
 stalks

    it was small and old and hopelessly old-
 fashioned yet about it there was some-
 thing that had been wholly lacking in the
 refineries of st pierre they were huge
 those refineries but they were also frankly
 commercial here one found in all its
 charm and fragrance the true enchantment
 of grinding

    it was not easy to leave this mill long
 after the carts had been unloaded and i
 had finished my business at the scales i
 hung about absorbed in the busy scene
 each detail was like a tonic to me the
 roar of the boilers the drip of the juice
 the slap of the carrier that perhaps even
 then was carrying a load from bois berard

    when finally i rode off i promised my-
 self that some day i would have such a
 mill of my own already i could picture
 it nestled snugly amid the trees

 so i returned with my thoughts in the
 future until near the edge of the fields i
 came upon the general he trotted out
 upon me suddenly from a field-road and
 at that moment it seemed a chance meet-
 ing only afterward did i understand
 that he had ridden there purposely to
 intercept me

   well he inquired after i had saluted
 him has everything been satisfactory
 perfectly so msieu i replied i
 would like to sell to you next year

   so you mean to keep on he ques-
tioned

   ah yes msieu said i eagerly next
 year i will have twice as much-perhaps
 more if msieu bonnemaison helps me
 the general considered this a moment
 he seemed almost impressed by my en-
 thusiasm

   then you intend to be a farmer rather
 than a storekeeper he observed

   that is it msieu i agreed i hope
 some day to be a planter

   not until i had spoken did i realize my
 mistake in a way i had corrected the
 general

   pardon msieu said i quickly i
mean that i would like to become a
farmer

   there fell a pause during which the
general eyed me absently then he spoke
in a strangely detached voice as if he were
iflhering his thoughts aloud

   no he mused you were right at
first you will never be a farmer you
will plant from the saddle or not at all
he checked himself and added with a
swift return to his usual tone-how
would you like to come here for the next
crop

   it was so sudden so wholly unexpected
 that i could only stammer in reply

  you mean msieu-you mean- i
began	

   irexactly broke in the general i
need a man in the field and i have heard
you well spoken of if you are willing i
can use you as soon as the crop is off

   his words restored my confidence they
 held no kindliness no hint of good-will
 to justify my confusion he needed a man
 and he had heard me well spoken of it
 was merely a matter of business

   before answering him i looked out over
 the wide sweep of the cane truly it was
 a temptation a year at marsh island
 would be a priceless experience

   then i thought of monsieur bonne-
maison of the store of those useless acres
of prairie that i might redeem for madame
alcfde

   msieu said i i am very grateful to
 you for your offer but i can not accept
jean trouve



it my duty lies in the woods it would
not be right for me to leave there

  the generals eyes were fierce as i fin-
ished evidently he was ill used to refusal
for an instant he appeared upon the point
of bursting into angry speech then he
resumed his cold indifference wheeling
about with a jerk of the bridle

  as you wish said he curtly and
turned off into the field-road leaving me
to stare after him with a curiously mingled
feeling of relief and disappointment

  riding on i reviewed our meeting until
i reached the point where the general had
seemed to speak his thoughts aloud

  no he had said you will never be
a farmer you will plant from the saddle
or not at all

  here was something to consider just
what had the general meant and now
that i thought of it madame alcide had
made some similar remark upon the occa-
sion of my first plowing

  first madame alcide and now the gen-
eral why should they comment upon
the manner in which i had planted my
crop

  the puzzle of this held me throughout
the rest of my ride so far as i could
see i was putting in my cane in the usual
fashion and if i were not why should
these two be so concerned at my going
about the matter in my own particular
way

chapter ix

an eventful spring

the spring that followed was a famous
one for bois berard with march it
found me planting not twice but a good
four times the amount of my former
acreage

  this increase the work of my employer
was far beyond my highest expectations
true monsieur bonnemaison had offered
to help me but i had never thought that
his assistance would take so substantial a
form in this case however his caution
haci been tempered by a fine sense of
appreciation

  upon my return from marsh island i
had been careful to give no hint of my
interview with the general nevertheless
in the mysterious fashion of such commu-

nities word of it had gone abroad upon
its reaching the woods monsieur bonne-
maison called me to him at once

  so jean said he i have just heard
of msieu the general and yourself you
have behaved well and you shall not be
the loser by it in the spring you will
see

  thus monsieur bonnemaison made good
his words at planting time by doubling my
expected crop this meant much work
and planning to meet the requirements of
his added acres teams must be found
implements must be bought together with
an extra supply of seed-cane also there
was the problem of additional labor

  in this the wood-folk seemed little in-
clined to help me for the most part they
were content to look on with a virtuous
indolence born of their efforts at grinding
they had cut my crop or they had of-
fered to do so which amounted to the
same thing now they meant to rest until
cool weather

  it was a difficult time and one in which
i might have fared badly had not mon-
sieur bonnemaison again come to my
assistance owning several cabins he gave
their tenants the choice of going into the
field or of making way for workers from
outside

  this aroused a storm of protest followed
by the threat of a general exodus but
through it all monsieur bonnemaison stood
firm in the end the wood-folk turned to
their natural philosophy and shrugged a
surrender

  bien they said it is our crop any-
way why should we leave it to these dirt-
grubbers from the prairie

  so the inhabitants went to work and so
began a period of prosperity for bois
berard if at first there was grumbling
and discontent this soon disappeared
through the magic of regular wages

  the wood-folk might love their ease but
they could not blind themselves to the
advantages of a weekly pay-roll

  before the crop was in hulin the
hunter had taken his turn in the field
he had been wrong he admitted a hoe
was surer than a gun you never missed
your dinner with a hoe

  in april cane gave place to politics
now that the elections were close at hand
the question of votes became all-absorb-
ing supported by the general monsieur

bonnemaison had seemed certain of vic-
tory but there was always the danger that
his opponents would combine this they
did at the last moment pesson dropping
out to give his support to the more prom-
ising dautrive

  then began a bitter fight that was
waged to the casting of the final ballot it
was a contest to delight the cajun heart
and when at its end monsieur bonnemaison
was declared the winner he was fairly
overcome by his emotion called on for
a speech he could only utter a few broken
words

  later my friends he choked just
now i can say nothing but i will show
you all what i feel

  this promise monsieur bonnemaison
kept in may by holding a general celebra-
tion half-fete half-barbecue it was
attended by friend and foe alike from
the farthest limits of the prairie the voters
came to enjoy monsieur bonnemaisons
boundless hospitality

  for a whole day there was eating and
drinking enlivened by various sports
horses were run chickens were fought
games were played of every kind also
monsieur bonnemaison atoned for his for-
mer muteness by delivering a speech of
thanks in the late afternoon

  among the many guests was monsieur
dugas he crept in alone from the prairie
a vacant imbecile-creature with drooling
lips and lifeless eyes all through the
merrymaking he stumbled about babbling
the tale of his wrongs

  it was msieu the general he kept re-
peating it had always been msieu the
general it would be like that until he
dugas had had a settlement and so he
went on half-whining half-threatening
wholly regardless of the haste with which
his listeners hurried away from him

  upon inquiry i learned that monsieur
dugas had met disaster while hiding in
the marsh some one had struck him from
behind and afterward he had become
queer now he was back on the prairie
where he drifted about existing precari-
ously upon such crumbs of charity as were
grudgingly thrown him

  he was quite harmless but he was also
very tiresome with his eternal arraignment
of msieu the general this was his one
obsession for all his trials and misfor-

henshaw

tunes he blamed the owner of marsh
island	

  poor monsieur dugas his plight was
pitiful yet it earned him little sympathy
those who took trouble to speak to him
declared that he was justly punished for his
evil deeds

  following monsieur bonnemaisons
speech the guests departed the late ones
being lighted upon their way by a bon-
fire that had been kindled at the edge
of the prairie so ended the celebration
a fitting close to that memorable spring

  with the arrival of june madame
alcide made ready for her annual pilgrim-
age to the convent once again she set
out alone for despite the offer of a well-
earned holiday doctor poussard could
not be induced to leave his post

  it is impossible he said to us the
business might suffer also madame would
not allow it i have explained and she
agrees with me in every way

  he was a far different poussard from
the forlorn creature of that former deser-
tion as he spoke his voice held almost a
note of authority well clothed and well
fed he had none of the officiousness that
is often the outcome of unexpected pros-
perity rather he was quietly pleased that
in his own simple way he had justified his
existence

  as for monsieur bonnemaison and my-
self we were well satisfied to have him
remain through our outside duties the
little doctor had become indispensable
often he was left in charge for the best
part of the day

  during madame alcides absence i
thought much of toinette save for that
brief visit at the second christmas i had
not seen her in two years would she be
much changed i wondered already i
had thought her grown

  now she was eighteen and for bois
berard eighteen meant a woman in every
way often girls were married there at
sixteen but of course toinette would not
think of marrying did she not have
madame alcide and myself the idea
was ridiculous

  to my surprize i found toinette little
different at first save that she was now
undeniably grown she seemed very much
the same in the matter of looks she was
thoroughly convincing one glance at her
and my problem of the months before was

romance
jean trouve



definitely solved despite my prejudiced
eyes i knew that monsieur bonnemaison
had spoken truly

  for a week toinette was once more my
comrade of the marsh indeed she seemed
to have become a girl again as she fol-
lowed me about through field and forest
her delight at my cane was almost childish
each detail must be explained to her while
she listened round-eyed with amazement

  jean jean she would cry it is too
much however did you do it

  in those days i felt immeasurably older
and wiser than toinette it was the con-
vent i told myself what else could one
expect after being shut in for all those
months

  later when the crop had become a mat-
ter of course and toinette had settled down
to the life of the woods i began to have
certain misgivings perhaps myfirst esti-
mate had been slightly wrong perhaps
toinette had not been so childish as she
had appeared she was so calm so direct
so quietly sure of herself it was just pos-
sible that she had made the most of my
achievement

  that would be like toinette had she
not done the same thing when papa ton
had left me in charge

  gradually these doubts became a cer-
tainty gradually  came to know that
my twenty years were as nothing to
toinettes eighteen if she had been shut
in it had been to good purpose during
those months she had gone far ahead of me
in every way

  at this time i often recalled my days of
convalescence at bayou portage in her
attitude toinette seemed somehow to have
gone back to them it was as if i had
become little jean again and she had re-
commenced my instruction in the business
of life

  yet like little jean i soon conquered
my resentment once more i set myself
to learn and in learning i came to find
that toinette and i had reached a new
perfection of companionship where be-
fore we had shared the present we now had
the future together-a wonderful golden
future impossible for the marsh

  with toinette this future meant a life
of teaching from her first month at the
convent she had hoped for it but it had
seemed too much now with the ending of
her third year she was almost sure al-

 ready she had taught the little children
successfully the good sisters declared
that she had found her true vocation

   all this toinette told me in confidence
exacting my promise that i would say noth-
ing of it to madame alcide

  even now it is no more than a hope
jean she said to me only after i have
finished can i be certain then it will be
time to tell tante aurore

   if i told her now and failed i could
not stand it tante aurore has been far
too good to me to risk such a thing but
think of what it will mean jean think
of all those little ones seeking the chance
that i shall be able to give them

  this was toinette grown always she
had been generous with the few good things
of her life now having received this gift
of education she found her chief joy in
her ability to share it with others

  that was a long-remembered june
each of its sunlit days brought an added
contentment looking ahead i saw only
the warm drowsy peace of a perfect
summer

   then a cloud appeared to mar this fair
horizon 

chapter x

the way of the world

returning one afternoon from the
field i found a visitor at madame
alcides it was young latour of st
pierre and he sat upon the gallery talking
to toinette always mindful of his ap-
pearance latour was dressed with especial
care his horse tied to the rack in front
represented the last word in grooming and
equipment

   this much i saw at a glance yet it told
me nothing as the older latour was a
wholesale dealer much favored by mon-
sieur bonnemaison i concluded that he
had sent his son to the woods upon some
matter of business

   our greeting over i waited for latour
to make known his errand this he seemed
little inclined to do for after a few com-
monplace remarks he resumed his conver-
sation with toinette

   the talk now turned to that part of the
summer when toinette had visited her rel-
atives evidently the relatives had made

much of this occasion there had been
dances and other entertainments to which
latour had replied by giving a picnic of his
own

  all this toinette had told me touching
upon it lightly i had not been interested
and she had quickly passed on to something
else now assisted by latour she made it
the subject of an animated discussion

  it was very gay and pleasant yet i had
the uncomfortable feeling of being an out-
sider also i became painfully aware of
the roughness of my field-clothes i wished
that i had come in from the back or that
latour had waited until sunday for his
visit that was the day for calls anyhow
then you could be sure of meeting people
upon more equal terms

  when finally i went into the house i
considered latour with a distinct sense of
injury first he had fooled me in the
matter of his visit next he had made me
feel ashamed of my clothes

  later madame alcide invited latour to
supper when it was over he delayed his
departure until moonrise this time ma-
dame alcide took her place upon the gal-
lery and the talk was both varied and
interesting

  nevertheless i felt that i had been
cheated certain things had occurred in
the field which i had wished to discuss with
toinette now they would be overshad-
owed by the work of another day it had
all been very tiresome and unsettling as
latour trotted off i hoped that he would
take his own good time in coming again

  following his visit toinette had other
callers perhaps latour had told the tale
of a pretty girl at bois berard perhaps
knowing of it already the others had
merely waited for him to set an example
at all events the young men began to ride
in from st pierre and the prairie to spend
an hour or so upon madame alcides front
gallery as for latour his visits increased
until he seemed fairly to haunt the woods

  disturbed myself i had expected ma-
dame alcide to be the same in the well-
ordered life of her household there should
have been no place for these bothersome
strangers yet she accepted it all as a
matter of course she even went farther
and discovered an advantage in the situa-
tion

  you see she would say to toinette
we are not wholly uncivilized also it is

nice to receive your friends in your own
home

  toinette i gave up in despair it seemed
incredible that she should submit to so
stupid an experience a little coldness
upon her part and the callers would have
taken their attentions elsewhere then we
could have returned to our interrupted
companionship

  but toinette bore with it patiently at
times she seemed genuinely pleased al-
ways she was so pleasant and cordial that
the callers made haste to return yet she
gave no hint of vanity all her life she
had won attention she accepted it as her
due

  at this time i-suffered no pang of jeal-
ously i was troubled perplexed dis-
gusted perhaps but my feelings went little
farther true i knew only too well what
this calling meant latour was deadly in
earnest as were several of the others

  yet i viewed their efforts with a curious
mixture of pity and contempt it seemed
wholly futile that these young men should
ride so far and so often for a girl who
would never have them

  sure of toinette before i was doubly
sure of her now did she not mean to
teach then how could she do so with a
home and family the callers were merely
wasting their time they might be a
nuisance but i could find in them no cause
for apprehension

  thus i argued fairly convinced that with
the passing of time these foolish intruders
would realize the hopelessness of their
quest but for all my assurance they con-
tinued to intrude always they were rid-
ing and driving in either to call or to take
toinette to some entertainment outside

  mid-summer found me thoroughly ex-
asperated toinettes vacation was now
more than half over also it had devel-
oped into a constant source of irritation
true the callers spent many evenings
away but i could never count upon them

  at the very moment when i wanted them
least they were certain to appear if i
complained madame alcide was quick to
remind me that toinette was having a
good time this was so perhaps but i
was having an exceeding bad one

  it did not occur to me that i might be
both stupid and selfish i had been so
busy in store and field that i knew nothing
of even the crude social life of the woods
jean trouve



i had paid no calls nor had i attended the
occasional balls and dances thanks to
madame alcide and her books i had found
my amusement at home

  thus i was unable either to understand
or accept the inevitable outcome of toin-
ettes attractiveness instead i sulked and
gloomed like an ill-natured boy it was all
so trifling and useless why could they
not leave toinette alone

 and next summer it would be the
same i knew that now this much at
least had been hammered into me by the
persistency of the callers it made no dif-
ference that toinette did not intend to
marry as long as she remained young and
pretty she would be sought after

  added to these annoyances -was the talk
that went about ever eager for gossip
the wood-folk made the most of toinettes
popularity each week brought some new
and startling rumor toinette had ac-
cepted latour she had made her choice
but she would not announce it until the
day of her return to the convent a dozen
times she was reported to have eloped and
it was even said once that she was already
secretly married

  that this talk was as silly as it was idle
i knew only too well yet in due time it
had its effect with every one predicting
toinettes speedy marriage i began to
doubt my former convictions the wood-
folk might be extravagant but i had the
wit to know that in the main they were
discussing a very ordinary possibility

  other girls -married leaving father and
mother why should not toinette an
orphan do the same true there was
her plan to teach and to it i clung with
the strength of despair it remained for
doctor poussard to shatter this final hope

  as loyal as he was punctilious the little
doctor had taken no part in the gossip
always he had frowned upon it uttering
a sharp reprimand whenever the talk ran
too freely at the store thug when after
such an outburst we found ourselves alone
he gave vent to his indignation

  dieu these tongue-waggers  he ex-
claimed nothing is sacred to them not
even a young girls name

  that is so i agreed they think
that toinette is like the rest it is beyond
them to see that she will never marry

  it happened that doctor poussard was
engaged in arranging some goods upon a

shelf i was thankful for this for i knew
that he would reply without looking up
just then i was not anxious for the little
doctors regard there had been an un-
spoken challenge in my words

  accepting my challenge doctor pous-
sard made light of it

  come jean that is a good one he
joked toinette never marry you are
outgossiping the gossips

  just the same it is so i persisted
stubbornly

  this time the little doctor looked up be-
fore replying evidently he wished to
make sure that i was in earnest he spoke
firmly yet kindly his tone suggesting in-
struction rather than argument

  no jean you are wrong said he
toinette will marry the toinettes of
this world always marry they must do
so if only to be let alone you will be
lucky if she is unpromised a year from
now

  a question rushed to my lips yet i could
not put it fairly i could only utter a
vague compromise	

  but what if a girl has-has plans i
demanded

  at this the little doctor smiled not in
mirth but with a stark bitterness that was
terrible to see

  plans he echoed and in his voice
there was the weariness of one who has
spanned the reach of endless barren years
ah yes we all have plans that is what
is -called ambition we strive and hope
and then something comes along and we
find ourselves concerned only with the ne-
cessity to keep going

  he paused and suddenly he was the old
doctor poussard again calm and gentle
gravely resigned to the tyranny of life

  plans will not do jean he finished
each girl has plans until the right man
comes along

  following this talk i reached a state of
final desperation try as i might i could
not doubt the little doctor he had made
it all too unpleasantly plain

  toinette would marry there could be
no doubt of that her ambition would be
forgotten once the right man came along
and he would come he always came
otherwise there would be few marriages
indeed

  it was dreadful to think of losing
toinette but there seemed nothing that i
i

	ne v i l g

could do it was life nature the way
of the world one could not stand out
against such things one could only accept
them patiently if possible like doctor
poussard

  so i tormented myself through the
breathless days of august then when
the summer had all but burned itself away
i had a sudden inspiration in a flash i
saw a way out-a simple easy way that
meant happiness for every one since
toinette must marry i would marry her
myself that would settle the matter for
all time

  following the relief of this discovery
came a vast amazement at my blindness
and stupidity it was incredible that i had
not thought of this before why it was
only what i would have been forced to do
in course of time toinette and i were
not brother and sister once madame
alcide was gone we could no longer live
together

  and i had not considered this absorbed
in the store and my crop i had blundered
along with never a thought of the future
now that i faced it i was aghast at the
risk i had run

  madame alcide was old toinette was
young and desirable should the one die
the other marry i would be left entirely
alone

  this thought brought panic what if i
was too late what if toinette had al-
ready given her promise there were
latour and the rest they had been mak-
ing their try while i in my ignorance had
looked on laughing

  it was plain that i had played the fool
yet like all who accomplish this feat i was
little inclined to accept the consequences
of my folly if i had delayed i would
make up for it with immediate action i
promised myself that i would speak to
toinette that very night

chapter xi

the way of toinette

fortunately there was no caller
that evening although had one ap-
peared his stay would have been brief so
overwrought was i that i would have gone
to any length to be rid of him

yet for all this i did not speak to toin-

hensh a w

ette immediately after supper instead i
nursed my impatience until the sun was
well down below the forest-rim then
when the woods were gray and shadowy
with the mystery of the twilight i pre-
pared to act

  come said i we will go as far as
the big oak

  walking along with toinette at my side
i lost my fears for a sense of security it
now seemed that i had been the victim of
my imagination

  toinette was so natural so wholly her
usual self surely she could not be like
that unless she were heart-whole she must
show the stress of a secret promise

  each moment my confidence increased
i was in time and i also felt that i was
entitled to a certain preferment even if
i were not the right man spoken of by
doctor poussard i was at least the first
man in toinettes experience and this
must count for something

  so i went on masking my thoughts be-
hind a chatter of small talk until the vast
bulk of the big oak reared itself above its
lesser neighbors beyond the ground was
wet and boggy from the seepage of the
near-by marsh so that there was nothing
for it but to turn back toward the settle-
ment facing about i gripped my courage
hard

  toinette i began you remember
that last day at the camp

  of course she replied how can i
ever forget it

  then you have not forgotten the meet-
ing at tante odiles i went on you
wished to stay and when madame declared
it impossible you said that we would
marry and keep on as before you remem-
ber this also

  yes answered toinette i remem-
ber it well

  and you meant it

  as you know-every word

  and now i questioned what if it
were to happen now would you say the
same and mean it

  thus far toinette had followed me with
the half-idle interest of one who discusses
a well-remembered past now at my last
words she turned upon me with a startled
swiftness that held almost a hint of fear
come jean what is it she demanded

do you mean-

  yes toinette said i answering her

mce -
jean trouve



unspoken thought that is what i mean
i want you to marry me

  for a space toinette was silent as she
stared at me through the dusk having
spoken i had looked away so that i could
catch no glimpse of her features yet i
knew that she stared i could feel her
eyes pass over me like carefully searching
hands then came her voice half-shy
half-glad yet having about it a quiet in-
sistence that was like a supplement to her
gaze

  but why jean she questioned

  had she spoken in some foreign tongue
i would have found it easier to reply
why indeed i asked myself true i
could have uttered some pretty speech but
i knew that toinette was not asking for
pretty speeches she wanted the truth
and what was the truth for the life of
me i could not say

  why i echoed lamely why does
any man ask a girl to marry him be-
cause he wishes her to be his wife

  so said toinette and turned abruptly
back again for all the world as if she had
been fully answered anxious and be-
wildered i fell into step beside her

  well i asked after i had waited in
vain for her to speak what have you to
say toinette

  why what can i say but yes jean
she replied am i not yours as i have
always been have we not belonged to
each other since that christmas eve when
in spite of my warning you cast your lot
with ours you knew what it meant to
stay yet you did not say no how can i
say no now

  though her voice was flat and dead i
paid no heed how could i know that it
was the weariness of disappointment

  it was the memory of that christmas
eve of course her thoughts had gone
back to a dark and bitter time then too
i was fully occupied with my own sense
of relief and satisfaction

  then that is all right toinette said
i you have taken a load from my mind
i have been worried t can tell you

  dim though the light was i could catch
the puzzled look that came into toinettes
face

  worried she questioned why

  it was latour i explained latour
and the rest

  ah exclaimed toinette and now she

was quick and eager then you were
jealous jean

  perhaps i answered vaguely i do
not know

  but if it was msieu latour and the

rest-

  she broke off and added smiling-
those boys it was foolish of you
jean

  just the same i was worried i went
on doggedly i feared that you might
marry and what would become of me
then if anything happened to madame
toinette considered this for what seemed
a very long time

  i see said she finally then it is not
so much that you wish to marry me as that
you do not wish me to marry some one
else

  this was rather complex for one in my
state of mind

  no i struggled it is not that

  then what is it persisted toinette
mercilessly

  dieu i exploded at the end of my re-
sources i am all mixed up i want you
toinette that is all i know

  by now we had reached the clearing that
bordered that end of the settlement just
ahead loomed the vague outline of the little
store dark and deserted since the flight of
monsieur dugas beyond the cabin lights
stood out against the dusk like soft re-
flections of the stars

  wc were almost back again yet i did not
halt instead i pushed blindly forward
until toinette swinging in before me laid
a detaining hand upon my shoulder then
came her other hand and her eyes
troubled and penitent looked into mine

  jean jean she pleaded you must
not go back like this why it is almost a
quarrel the first that we have ever had
if i have teased you i am sorry but you
were so serious jean now we will it
down and you will tell me what you do
mean-that is if you know yourself
releasing me she seated herself upon
one of the many stumps that dotted the
clearing she had finished lightly yet her
attitude was one of tenseness i noticed
that her hands were tightly clasped as i
dropped down beside her

  now we will start all over again jean
she began you wish to marry me

  as i have said

  and you love me
	nevl g

  of course

  but you have not told me so

  why should i when you know it so
well

  true muttered toinette and in the
pause that followed she relaxed unclasping
her hands

  well i urged after i had waited
plucking at the grass

  coming to herself with a little start
toinette threw out her hands

but how can we jean she demanded
it is something to dream of that is all
here was complexity with a vengeance
brief though it was i had been unable to
solve toinettes reverie

  you mean- i began

  jean jean she interrupted can you
not see have you not thought do you
imagine that there is nothing to all this
save your question and my answer there
are a dozen things that make it impossible
why i am not even out of the convent

  i had thought of that said i i can
wait

  then there is my teaching

  that also can be arranged

  and your cane jean what of that
you have just started and you are doing
well how would it be with a wife

  this obstacle i paused to consider since
it bulked far larger in my eyes than in
those of toinette herself how indeed
would it be with a wife if i were to keep
on as i had planned each penny that i
could scrape and save must go toward the
crop i would be hard put to it to look out
for myself and what if i had poor luck
cane is tricky with a bad year i might
easily find myself in debt

  the fact that i had overlooked this only
rendered my position the harder to my
shame was added a feeling of helplessness
here i was insisting upon toinettes marry-
ing me when i was not even sure that i
could support a wife

  evidently toinette was more proficient
than myself in the matter of solving
reveries

  you see she observed we must be
free for a while otherwise we can not go
ahead we have our chance jean and we
must make the most of it we must not
think of marrying now

  this seemed true enough following
toinettes reasoning i found that i had no
particular desire for an immediate marriage

henshaw

myself all my thoughts and hopes were
fixed upon my plans for the future once
they were realized it would he time to
think of settling down

  you are right toinette i agreed i
have gone too fast but i was worried and
i did not think

toinette accepted this with a smile half-
rising from her stump it was only too
plain that for her the discussion was ended
bien jean said she yet you worried

for nothing those boys-

  she broke off abruptly realizing her mis-
take but already it was too late with her
words had returned the trials of that sum-
mer to drive all thoughts of prudence from
njy mind

  what was my cane compared to the tor-
ment of the summer to come with
toinette free of the convent it would be
worse than ever there would be no peace
for me no rest always i would be think-
ing of what the little doctor had said

  it was too much i could not stand it
we must marry and take our chance and
yet even as i sprang to my feet my mood
held far less of jealousy than of final ex-
asperation

  wait began toinette but her words
were lost in the violence of my outburst

  no i cried i can not wait we
must settle this here and now either you
will marry me or refuse me there is no
other way

  in what followed toinette acted with a
swiftness that told of impulse rather than
thought indeed i was hardly conscious
that she had risen before her hands were
upon my shoulders again this time they
gripped me fiercely while in the eyes up-
turned to mine was a look of quiet purpose
such as i had not seen there before

  no jean said she there is a way
even though we should not marry and you
can not wait there is still this way if only
you can trust me

  there could be but one answer to this
trust you i echoed if i do not
trust you whom else can i trust

  so said toinette then i give you
my solemn promise that i will marry no
one but yourself surely you will be will-
ing to wait with that

  again i was reduced to a single answer
toinette had won yet as i considered
her offer i did not feel that i had lost

nce --
jean trouve

come what might i could count upon
toinette to be as good as her given word

  that may do i gave in grudgingly

  and i added after a moment-

  then we are betrothed

  toinettes smile was enigmatic

  perhaps she replied who can say
at all events we understand each other

  dropping her hands she went on more
seriously

  but we must keep it to ourselves for the
present jean othenvise it would be
foolish no one must know not even
tante aurore

  the wisdom of this could not be gain-
said indeed when i considered madame
alcides inevitable opinion of our agree-
ment my sensations were rather those of a
naughty boy than of an accepted suitor

  of course i consented hastily you
can count upon me to say nothing

  after this there fell rather an awkward
silence which lasted more or less through-
out our return to the settlement at the
moment there seemed nothing to talk about
having exhausted the present we had ar-
rived at a future far too indefinite to be of
any particular interest

  aside from this i was in no mood for
speech just then i was experiencing the
dazed confusion of one who has revolved
rapidly in a mental circle

  toinette had been too quick for me so
swiftly had she passed from one phase of
the affair to another that i was still rather
uncertain as to what had actually occurred
i felt that if left to myself it would all
gradually straighten itself out in my mind
therefore i was only too glad when upon
reaching the house madame alcide de-
clared that we had walked half the night
and promptly hurried us off to bed

  later in the privacy of my room i
pieced together the events of the evening
the result while promising a satisfactory
conclusion was far from gratifying in-
deed i could only feel that considered as
a proposal my effort had proved a pitiful
failure

  not only did it lack the joy and ardor
demanded by such an occasion it was
even devoid of the usual pleasant aftercon-
sequences of announcement and congrat-
ulation

  in my musings of the afternoon i had
spent some time in considering how i might
best break the news to bois berard now

there would be no news to break mon-
sieur bonnemaison would not pound me
jovially upon the back the little doctor
would not shake me gravely by the hand

  and worst of all i was denied the
pleasure of sending latour and his friends
about their business true i was now as-
sured that their efforts were useless but
this mattered little when they did not know
it themselves

  when at last i dropped off to sleep it
was with a most uncomfortable sense of
defeat somehow i felt as if toinette had
tricked me

  next day being wholly dissatisfied i
waylaid toinette and demanded a read-
justment of the situation this she re-
fused declining even to discuss the matter
it was all settled she declared there was
no need to go into it again

  throughout this brief interview toinette
was both gentle and patient but she was
also very firm afterward she kept me at
arms length merely replying with a smile
and a shrug to my frequent demands as to
whether we were really betrothed

  i will never forget those few remaining
weeks of toinettes vacation in their un-
certainty and bewilderment they were
worse even than the ones that had gone
before it was almost a relief when they
finally ended and toinette drove back to
the convent again i missed her but with
her departure i managed to regain some
part of my peace of mind

  then came the fall to turn my thoughts
to the all-important matter of grinding

chapter xii

monsieur bonnemaison reveals himself

that year the taking off of the crop
occupied my entire attention it was
a splendid crop if not quite the equal of
my first one and thanks to the increase
of acreage it promised an excellent profit
as a consequence monsieur bonnemaison
was little inclined to take any risks in the
matter of its disposal

  you must be with it from the cutting
of the first stalk to the weighing of the final
cart jean said he also i will give you
what help i can this is the important
year and we must make the most of our

nce
t

n e v i l g

opportunity once we have done so our
success is assured

  it was significant that monsieur bonne-
maison spoke in the plural however he
had declared his attitude some time before
all through the summer he had been about
the field watching the crop with an ever
increasing interest

  in addition he had discussed the growing
of cane with all of the enthusiasm that he
had formerly bestowed upon his cherished
politics in brief monsieur bonnemaison
had been quietly fitting himself for the pro-
fession of agriculture his our success
was merely his way of informing me that
he had now reached a stage where he felt
justified in sharing our joint responsibility

   his offer of assistance i accepted eagerly
i had hoped for it nor indeed could i have
done very well without it in the art of
managing men monsieur bonnemaison was
a master during the trials of the spring
he had proved this upon more than one
occasion

  i thank you msieu said i it is
good of you especially your offer to help
but what of the store

  we can leave that to poussard
answered monsieur bonnemaison if
necessary i will find him a clerk

  he paused as if in thought while his
smile took on a touch of whimsicality

  it is curious about the store he added
it was once my world beyond it and my
home i had nothing in view but that was
before i had looked about me

  thus doctor poussard achieved the
seventh heaven of being left wholly in
charge it was a tremendous event for
him and his pride was only equaled by his
sense of responsibility however as he
had conducted the business alone through-
out the greater part of the summer his
position was little changed save for the
generous increase that monsieur bonne-
maison saw fit to make in his wages

  this arrangement although highly sat-
isfactory to the little doctor and myself
placed me in what i conceived to be an
irregular position now that i had aban-
doned my work at the store i could hardly
consider myself in monsieur bonnemaisons
employment as a consequence i felt that
i was no longer entitled to my former pay

  monsieur bonnemaison however made
short work of this fine-spun theory i was
in his employment he declared he had

not dismissed me and until he did so i
was under his orders if he chose to put
me in the field instead of the store that
was his affair

  this was true as far as it went but be-
ing young and disposed to take a high
stand in the matter i accused monsieur
bonnemaison of padding his pay-roll in
order to gratify his generosity thereupon
he ceased his blustering and for the first
time allowed me a glimpse of the far-seeing
shrewdness that lay forever ambushed be-
hind his smile

  are you blind jean he chided me
must i show you everything but then
i was blind myself like you i stuck in
one place my eyes were opened only
through the politics the talk outside

  he paused checked by his usual cau-
tion and when he went on it was with a
restraint that only lessened before his ever
increasing interest 

  you spoke of the store he continued
as i have said it was once my world
now compare it with this new world of
mine a world of cane reaching from here
to the refineries of st pierre you may
think this too much but i tell you that it
will come also it will not be in one great
plantation or a dozen but in a hundred
scattered farms

  he broke off and one of his short arms
went out as if to point a vision actually be-
fore us

  you see jean you see he de-
manded

  i saw but it was not the vision of my
dreams always they had shown me the
broad acres of the planter

  it is something to think of but it will
also be something to manage msieu said
i how will you see after a hundred scat-
tered farms

  before replying monsieur bonnemaison
looked at me as if to make sure that i was
not joking

  dieu jean he exclaimed you are
blinder than i thought can you see
nothing but your crop it is not the cane
or even the farms they are nothing it
is the land that counts those acres out
there that have been good only for cattle
to walk over what will they be worth
when we have proved that they can make
the best of cane

  i saw now but dimly it was not easy
to grasp it the prairie was like the ocean
jean trouve

it gave one the impression of an endless
expanse

  then you mean- i began

  most certainly interrupted monsieur
bonnemaison

  and he added reading my thoughts with
the ease of one scanning a printed page
yes there is a lot of it jean even now
i am not sure of my own acreage

  with his words came a new conception
a conception so fabulous that i almost
feared to put it to the test of speech

  but msieui faltered madame al-
cide-she also has hundreds of acres-

  rubbing his fat hands with relish mon-
sieur bonnemaison uttered an undeniable
chuckle despite my denseness he had at
last driven home the point of his joke

  of course jean said he your
madame will be rich some day and all
through you at first i was like yourself
i saw only the cane then i began to look
ahead after your first year i was almost
sure now i know it may take time but
it will come good land is good land you
have only to make folk see

  as he finished monsieur bonnemaisons
face flushed suddenly crimson at the time
i thought this the result of his vehemence
now i know that he had just begun to
realize the extent to which he had revealed
himself yet it was proof of his fondness
for me that having done so he allowed me
to remain in his confidence in all that
followed his attitude was that of the part-
ner rather than of the employer

  just now however he returned to the
latter role

  bien jean said he bruskly let us
have no more talk of unearned pay i am
playing for my greatest stake and you are
my best card you will do well to remem-
ber this

  following monsieur bonnemaisons dis-
closure i attacked my work with an eager-
ness that was tempered by an acute sense
of responsibility it was now no longer
a question of my future but of madame
alcides if i failed i could start again
for her it was the last chance of prosperity
like lafitte alcide berard had left his
treasure underground it remained for me
to bring it to the-light of day

  if i did so what a joy it would be
why it would mean that i had made some
return to madame alcide for her ceaseless
care and affection repayment even of

the slightest would be a supreme satisfac-
tion

  although no mention had been made of
the matter i knew that my work at the
store was definitely ended next year we
would again increase our acreage and al-
ready my employer was considering a
scheme of small separate crops to be
worked upon the tenant-system

  this meant a heavy increase of duty for
monsieur bonnemaison although wholly
admirable as an executive was of little use
in the field it was plain that i would have
all and perhaps more than i would well
attend to

  evidently monsieur bonnemaison was
not without an appreciation of the task
ahead of me for soon after our talk he
sent word to the field one afternoon that he
must see me immediately at the store
upon arriving there i found him busily
engaged in inspecting a bunch of ponies
that had been driven in by a rider from
the prairie they were small wiry ponies
of a type frankly cajun yet even to my un-
trained eyes they showed the results of care-
ful breeding

  well questioned monsieur bonnemai-
son what do you think of them they
are from old lalandre

  after this there was no room for crit-
icism even had i been capable of it the
horses of cyprien lalandre the patriarch
of the prairie were in a class by themselves

  they are beauties all of them msieu
said i enthusiastically any choice will
be a wise one

  true agreed monsieur bonnemaison
yet there must always be a preference
come jean what do you say

  thus questioned i considered the ponies
until finally i decided upon a tough little
sorrel with markings of white about the
head and forelegs

  bien said monsieur bonnemaison and
called the rider into the store from which
he presently emerged to tie the sorrel to the
rack in front

  this is rouge he announced before
trotting away with his remaining charges

  only waiting for him to start i prepared
to follow his example i was both puzzled
and irritated by this unexpected summons
that monsieur bonnemaison should buy a
new pony was all very well and good that
however he should call me in to make a
choice for him was a different matter i

knew little of horses and just then the work
in the field was particularly pressing

  if you are through with me msieu i
will go back again said i there is
much to be done before sunset

  answering my tone monsieur bonne-
maison made a gesture of mock despair

  jean you are hopeless he cried do
you imagine that i sent for you on account
of your knowledge of horseflesh come
use the sense that you show in other things
here i have given you the pick of old la-
landres best and you have not the wit to
see it

  for a moment i was unable to reply all
along i had desired a horse of my own
only the stern necessities of my crop had
prevented me from buying one months be-
fore true i had had the use of monsieur
bonnemaisons animal but he was a pon-
derous beast ill-adapted to the saddle

  por me msieu i linallv managed to
ask for me

  of course smiled monsieur bonnemai-
son also you need not thank me since
i am merely adding to our equipment and
now come inside for a saddle and bridle
the sooner you choose them the quicker
you can ride back to the field again

  thus i came into possession of rouge
whose equal i have yet to mount true
he was often uncertain of temper true
also that despite every effort he remained
unbroken to harness these deficiences
were but the proof of his breeding with-
out them he would not have been a cajun
pony

  for the rest he lacked no single virtue
of his kind he was swift he was willing
and his gaits lacked the usual pounding
in addition he seemed tireless though
the road be long and the going heavy his
last mile was ever like his first one

  during the first flush of my gratitude i
had determined to abolish the rather ob-
vious rouge in favor of the given name of
my employer but this monsieur bonne-
maison refused to allow

  but you can not do it he objected
he is already named he is rouge just
as he is a horse it is impossible

  accordingly rouge retained his original
litle nor in afterdays did i greatly regret
this arrangement for being blissfully ig-
norant of a sardonic future monsieur
bonnemaisons parents had seen fit to
christen him narcisse -

  thanks to my employers foresight i
now found little difficulty in looking after
our crop mounted upon rouge it was
an easy matter to follow the work in all
parts of the field yet with the arrival of
grinding i soon saw that it would be im-
possible for me to accompany the carts to
the island for us it was a large crop and
the labor was uncertain only through
constant supervision could i be certain of
the cutting and loading

  accordingly we decided upon a division
of labor i would keep to the field and take
off the crop joe vital promoted now to
the position of head teamster would attend
to its hauling at the island monsieur
bonnemaison would look after the weights
and prices and the various other matters
pertaining to its disposal

   these latter duties were of a sort to ap-
peal directly to the genius of monsieur
bonnemaison from the first he evidenced
a wholly unconcealed delight in them each
morning he drove off with the first of the
carts each afternoon he stopped at the
field to report the days proceedings

   it is the best of all this cane he would
exclaim enthusiastically it is making a
young man of me i can not understand
how i spent all those years behind my
counter

  of the general he spoke often for the
two had found a meeting-ground in the dis-
cussion of cane and politics

   he is a sharp one msieu the general
monsieur bonnemaison would declare as
a planter he is an expert and he has also
told me some things about the police jury
of which i had never so much as dreamed
i am only waiting for the next meeting
believe me there are one or two members
who have a surprize in store for them
and he would add as often as not
msieu the general is pleased with our
effort he says that we have done well
yourself in particular indeed he has more
than once inquired about you this means
something jean the good-will of such a
man will go far to help us

  later when the crop was oft and grind-
ing over he became more explicit

  you are lucky jean said he one day
when talking of the island msieu the
general seems to have taken a real interest
in you now that i think of it he has
asked everything about you not all at
once of course but from time to time it

is only sincei have considered his ques-
tions together that i have realized their
completeness

  this should have given me something to
think of but at the time  was absorbed in
our plans for the coming year again the
prairie-crop had proved a success and
monsieur bonnemaison was preparing to
branch out in a truly startling manner

  not only had he decided to plant the
last possible acre on his own account he
was already arranging a number of small
crops upon his proposed tenant-system

  all this meant a tonnage of cane beyond
the capacity of the generals antiquated
mill on the other hand the long haul to
the refineries of st pierre would prove pro-
hibitive monsic-ur bonnemaison however
seemed little annoyed by the difficulties of
this situation

  wait and see he had replied when i
pointed them out to him is there not a
railroad on the prairie and am i not a
member of the police jury all i ask is
that you grow the cane jean i will guar-
antee that it gets to the mill

  accordingly i had found no lack of work
with the end of grinding from dawn to
dark i was in the saddle arranging the de-
tails of this sudden expansion many acres
of the prairie must be examined with an
eyes to cultivation

  also there was the fresh accumulation of
teams and carts and implements for these
i went to st pierre so that i soon became
a familiar figure upon the streets of the
town

  and there one day i ran across le bossu
seeing him for the first time since his visit
to the woods we met upon the street and
the little mans delight and satisfaction
were only equaled by my own

  jean jean he cried as he gripped me
so we have come together at last all
along we have been dodging each other like
boats in a fog and now we will have some
coffee and you will tell me all about
toinette and yourself dieu it warms
mv heart to be with you again

  we sat long over the coffee-cups while i
gave le bossu my news telling him of all
that had occurred save my betrothal and
this in my joy of seeing him i would have
confided as well had it not been for my
promise to toinette

  afterward the little man spoke briefly of
himself he had enjoyed the swamp in-

deed once he had become accustomed to it
he had found it hard to leave since get-
ting back it had been the usual thing and
just now he was outfitting for an expedition
to white lake yes it was far but that
was to be expected one had to travel
these days for good skins

  this time le bossus farewell was more
comforting

  good-by for a little while jean said
he at parting with the end of the sea-
son i will be back again and you say
that toinette leaves the convent this year
bien you may tell her that despite my
neglect she will see me then

  thus with these various distractions i
paid scant heed to monsieur bonnemaisons
talk of the general if my grandfather had
developed a sudden interest in me it was
no affair of mine our relationship had
been definitely established upon the occa-
sion of our first meeting five minutes
after monsieur bonnemaison had spoken to
me his words were completely forgotten

  as a consequence i was wholly unpre-
pared for an event that occurred near the
end of winter riding into st pierre one
morning upon a matter of business i was
handed a note by monsieur gajan the
dealer from whom i bought my implements
of the source of the note monsieur gajan
knew nothing he could only say that it
had been left at his place for delivery

  having read the note which requested
that i call at once on judge cestia upon a
matter of importance i had still no sus-
picion for as st pierres leading lawyer
judge cestia had more than once looked
after the interests of monsieur bonnemai-
son

  setting out in answer to his summons i
decided that it merely concerned some
fresh ramification upon the part of my em-
ployer

chapter xiii

  an interview with judge cestia

as became one of his position judge
cestia occupied the entire lower floor
of a small brick building near the court-
house in front was a waiting-room fur-
nished with the usual chairs and table and
an orderly array of leather-backed volumes
beyond this room and connected with it by

       --romance
 

nevil g henshaw

means of a heavy door was the private
office in which the judge considered the

affairs of his various clients

  upon arriving in the waiting-room i
was received by a clerk to whom i gave niv
name adding that as i was very busy-i
should like to see the judge as soon as pos-
sible having looked me over with evident
dissatisfaction the clerk replied that the
judge was busy also and i could come back
in the afternoon

  thereupon i thought of my note which
produced an immediate and satisfactory
effect one glance at it and the clerk had
popped into the inner office a moment
later he popped out again requesting with
the utmost politeness that i step inside

  had i been versed in the way of law-
offices i might have been impressed by
this sudden change of front as it was i
merely congratulated myself upon not de-
stroying the note and passed in all inno-
cence into the other room

  here were more leather-backed volumes
lining the walls and overflowing on to a
large flat-topped desk at which the judge
was waiting to receive me

  he was a small dapper man very care-
ful as to his dress and the waxing of his
pointed white mustache for the rest in
the sauve assurance of his gaze in the fine-
ly modulated tones of his voice he was the
very embodiment of the twin legal virtues
of discretion and persuasion one had but
to look at judge cestia to know that he was
discreet one had only to hear him speak
to realize the impossibility of refusing him

  as i entered the judge bowed courteous-
ly and then looked beyond me to where his
clerk was shutting the door this accom-
plished he turned back to me in swift
apology

  pardon said he in french it is
necessary that the door be properly closed
otherwise it is not sound-proof

  motioning me to a chair he added-

  you are monsieur marsh of course

  i was startled and i showed it i could
see judge cestias eyebrows go up in ac-
knowledgment of my confusion

  no msieu i replied i am afraid
that you have made a mistake i am jean
t rouve

  the judge considered this twisting a
point of his mustache

  i see said he finally then i will put

my question in a different manner were
you not at one time john marsh

  this could not be denied in addition
my curiosity was now thoroughly aroused

  yes msieu i answered promptly

  then you are the grandson of general
marsh of marsh island

  i was at that time msieu

  dismissing this distinction with a shrug
the judge settied back in his chair

  very good said he we can now go
ahead with the business in hand but be-
fore doing so i musttell you that it is an
affair of the utmost delicacy for this rea-
son i addressed you at gajans rather than
through the mail i am sure that i can rely
upon you to keep what is said here between
ourselves

  of course msieu

  very good repeated the judge and fell
abruptly silent as if marshaling his
thoughts

  it was evident that to him at least the
forthcoming disclosure was one of consid-
erable importance

  to begin with there are certain points
to be established he resumed after a mo-
ment once you have considered them
and fixed them in your mind you will the
more readily grasp the full meaning of my
proposal

  in the first place your grandfather gen-
eral marsh is growing old in the second
he is possessed of a very considerable es-
tate tn the third he has no heirs beyond
some distant cousins in the fourth not
only are you his grandson but he has had
some very good reports of you these are
the points to which i referred i have made
them clear to you

  save in one respect i answered if
general marsh wishes me to know these
things why does he not tell me of them
himself

  to me it seemed a perfectly natural ques-
tion nevertheless the judge was visibly
disturbed it was not often that he was
forced to submit to so direct and brutal an
attack upon his discretion

  pardon said he but you do not ap-
preciate my position as a lawyer i am
not the master but the servant of my
clients they come to me with certain de-
mands which i can only put into execution
it is not for me to question them as to their
motives

  to this t renlied with a nod for by now

romance
jean trouve	q

my thoughts were elsewhere i knew what
was coming and in knowing it i was filled
with a vast and bitter resentment

  evidently the judge misunderstood my
nod for he leaned forward in his chair to
smile at me it was a friendly comforting
half-patronizing smile plainly intended to
set me at my ease

  be assured it seemed to say what
if great affairs are afoot am i not here
to attend to them

  then judge cestia spoke very quietly
almost solemnly yet with an effectiveness
that was a triumph of repression

  monsieur said he it is my pleasure
to inform you that general marsh has de-
cided to make you his heir not only this
but he requests you to come to him at
marsh island there you will take your
proper place as his grandson

  he paused glancing at me as if in expect-
ation of another nod but this time i was
ready for him also if in reply i answered
him shortly it was with no intention of
giving offense put into words the gen-
erals offer had further infuriated me by
what i considered its calm effrontery

  he was a cool one my grandfather
first he had driven me off when helpless
and alone i had applied for his protection
now being in need of an heir and finding
me better suited to his taste he was order-
ing me back by means of his lawyer

  msieu said i i have heard your pro-
posal and here is my answer you may
tell the general that i have already found
my proper place also that i intend to
keep it

  that judge cestia expressed no surprize
at this curt refusal was significant evi-
dently he had been prepared for it still
leaning forward in his chair he surveyed
me with a look in which was a curious
blending of pity and distaste his atti-
tude was that of a connoisseur who ob-
serves the wilful rejection of some rare and
priceless possession

  so monsieur said he then you re-
fuse to consider the matter

  i have considered it i replied were
i to think over it a month my answer
would be the same

  at this he eyed me with sudden suspicion
if you think that you have any claim
he began your father married under age
and without consent-

  he broke off as if reassured by my look
and went on in liis former tone

  come monsieur you must be reason-
able at least you will admit that we are
not discussing a trifle therefore you can
hardly put me off with a word

  true i agreed yet what else can i
say it must be either yes or no and i
have already said no if you wish my

reasons-

  the judge held up his hand also he
now abandoned his formal monsieur
thus he subtly indicated the gulf that must
ever exist between a prospective john
marsh and an obdurate jean trouve

  no my friend no reasons said he
they relate to events long past and for-
gotten our business is with the present

  so you know i questioned

  i do he replied it is my business
to know therefore i can assure you that
my reasons which relate to your accept-
ance are the only ones of consequence
come let us consider them you are in-
terested in cane are you not

  i am msieu

  you desire to become a planter

  i do msieu

  you have begun at the bottom

  as you say msieu

  you have visited the fields at marsh
island

  several times msieu

  what do you think of them

  i have seen none better msieu
throughout this questioning the judge
had held me with the fixity of his gaze
now all of a sudden he relaxed to survey
me with the easy smile of one who has re-
tired from some swift and simple victory

  well he demanded what more can
you ask you are after cane and what do
i offer you only a place at the top upon
land which you yourself declare to be of
the best in addition you acquire a name
a position unequaled in this parish

  opening a drawer of his desk he drew
from it a sheet of paper

  you may see for yourself he added
as he held it out to me

  taking the paper i read its few lines of
precise penmanship which announced that
a certain unnamed testator bequeathed and
devised his entire estate to his grandson
john marsh save for the omission of date
and signature it was the usual brief 
louisiana will
o	n e v i l g

  this of course is a copy explained
the judge the original is in the posses-
sion of general marsh he will sign it im-
mediately upon your coming to him for
the rest you hold your future there in
your hand you are lucky my friend few
are offered such a chance

  he broke off leaving me to the fascina-
tion of the will and well might he do so
since it held for me the most tantilizing of
prizes i could see those broad fertile
acres sloping down to the old-fashioned
mill they were unequaled they were
ideal all along they had stood for the
height of achievement and now i held
them in my hand

  watching me the judge resumed his
easy smile

  well he questioned

  i do not know msieu i replied it
is all as you say and yet-

  and yet you might do as well with
bonnemaison he finished for me

  perhaps so said i he has been very
kind

  of course agreed the judge bonne-
maison is a good man any one will tell
you that but is he the man for you he
has told me of his plan of a hundred scat-
tered farms of a switch from the railroad
linking the farms with the refineries of st
pierre this may come but if it does you
will not be a planter you will merely find
yourself bonnemaisons overseer

  this was true-so true in fact that it
served to confirm certain doubts of my own
ever since the day when monsieur bonne-
maison had disclosed his plans i had con-
sidered them with growing uncertainty

  i was for cane monsieur bonnemaison
was for the land once he had established
his small farms he would in all probability
cease planting upon his own account thus
i woufd have the choice of becoming his
manager or overseer or of going ahead by
myself

  it would be hard to keep on alone now
that i had tried it  knew without back-
ing a single year might finish me also
i was filled with youthful impatience at
best it would take a long time

  again i looked down at the paper in my
hand here was certainty- of success a
future instantly achieved it could be my
future for the saying of a word nay
more-it could be toinettes as well had

henshaw

s the right to deny her this had i the
reason 

  one by one my objections had gone down
before the remorseless logic of judge cestia
there remained only the memory of my
grandfathers denial

  yet it was not easy to renounce this
memory for years it had envenomed my
secret thoughts even now its bitterness
dulled the keen edge of my desire as i
brooded upon it the paper crackled be-
neath the clench of my hand

   observing this judge cestia made a ges-
ture of reproof

  look ahead my friend he advised
it is not for you to trouble with the past
that is the occupation of age

  so calm were his words so utterly as-
sured that only afterward did i realize that
i had not spoken my thoughts aloud
just the same it is hard to forget i

declared to be kicked out-

but the judge was weary of my groping
and what if you were kicked out he
demanded sharply that is long over and
done with and your grandfather is doing
his best to make it up to you

  he paused reaching for his mustache
and added as if in afterthought-

  when hurt as a child were you ever
given something to dry your tears

  i recalled certain efforts of madame
therese

   why jes msieu i replied

  the judges hand came down with a
thump amid the papers of his desk

   then here is the biggest something that
has ever been offered you he cried stop
your whining and take it

  there was no withstanding judge cestia
he knew everything he even read ones
thoughts of a sudden i felt very young
and foolish i wondered at the presump-
tion that had caused me to hold out against
him

  then i thought of the future of my be-
trothal of the long harassed period of wait-
ing that was inevitable if i kept on alone
at bois berard i pictured latour and his
fellow callers i recalled the uncertainties
of that past vacation

  one word and all this would be forever
behind me established at marsh island
i could marry toinette as soon as her
studies were oyer we could begin our
future together

   rising i laid the paper upon the judges
jean trouve



desk very much as if it had been some doc-
ument of surrender

  bien msieu said i i accept your
offer when does my grandfather wish me
to come to him

  had i looked for any expression of grat-
ification upon the part of judge cestia i
would have been sorely disappointed but
then there was small cause for the judge
to be gratified having been sure from
the first he had looked upon my wavering
as a waste of valuable time

  true he resumed his monsieur but
this was merely in token of my changed
estate it was in just such delicate points
of formality that the judge excelled

  very good monsieur said he then
we may consider the matter as settled as
for your going to your grandfather the
sooner the better winter is all but over
and spring planting will soon begin
but there is my employer i objected
i can not leave him all at once

  bonnemaison will understand began
the judge but i broke in on him with an
idea that had suddenly occurred to me

  how would it be if i went to the island
and looked out for msieu bonnemaison
from there i questioned it is not so
far and i can manage it until some one
is found to take my place

  the judge was almost brusk in his dis-
missal of -this plan

  that would not do at all said he ve-
hemently general marsh would not
understand neither would he approve
he paused and added in the calmer tone
of explanation

  you see monsieur you are about to
make a great change once you leave the
woods you are done with them forever
you must consider your new life and forget
the old one the two will not mix it
can not be done

  to my ignorance this seemed reasonable
enough placed in the generals position
monsieur bonnemaison would hve felt the
same

  i see said i you are right msieu
one can not work for two people at the
same time

  the judge shook his head

  pardon monsieur said he patiently
but you do not see it is not only the
work it is everything else-the intima-
cies the friendships all the other ties that
have bound you to your old life when

you go to marsh island you must break
these ties also you will not be expected
to attempt the impossible task of piecing
them together again

  i began to understand now though very
vaguely it was too much to take in all
at once

  but msieu i stammered you
mean- why they are my friends my

people-they-

  exactly interrupted the judge it
is unfortunate but it is the price of prom-
inence when you go up on the hill you
can not expect to take the valley with you
you will find general marsh most particu-
lar upon this point as he has every right
to be he is offering you all that he has
in return he merely asks that you start
fresh with him in every way

  he paused- eyeing me expectantly but
i could only stare back at him in slow be-
wilderment it was still too much
madame alcide monsieur bonnemaison
the little doctor give them all up no
it was ridiculous there must be some
mistake

  then i thought of another and found
my tongue

  toinette i demanded what of her
msieu

  the judge spread out his hands evi-
dently as in all else he had been fully in-
formed about toinette

 what can i say monsieur he
answered you must see for yourself that
it is inevitable your positions will not be
the same

  but we are betrothed i cried forget-
ting all caution it was for her as much
as for myself that i accepted

  with my words the judge was out of his
chair it was the betrothed that moved
him bringing him to his feet as swiftly and
as unexpectedly as if he had been propelled
by some hidden spring one look he gave
me of surprize of consternation of polite
but unmistakable injury then wheeling
about he fell nervously to pacing the room

  so so he muttered to himself before
turning back to me again

  come monsieur said he sternly
this is serious you should have told me
of it at first as it is you must arrange
the affair yourself or at best with such aid
as i can give you general marsh must
know nothing of it it might ruin your
chance entirely
	nevil g

  recovering himself he added in his pre-
cise legal tone

  and now let us get at the facts you
have announced this betrothal you have
made any mention of it in writing

  though my temper was rising i an-
swered him quietly

  no msieu said i there has been
no announcement the affair is strictly be-
tween ourselves and i had no right to men-
tion it having done so i can only count
on your discretion

  the judge drew a quick breath of relief

  good very good he exclaimed then
a word from you will be enough with
no proof there can he no afterconse-
quences

  as i heard him my anger changed to
sudden disgust all at once i was sick of
the whole affair i thought of toinette and
grew hot with shame then came the
thought of my father to bring back my
anger again so this was what they had
tried on him and now they were trying
it on me

  the judge had begun to speak but i
stopped him abruptly i felt that the sooner
it was over the better it would be for both
of us

  hold msieu said i you have said
enough if i have been dull i am sorry
but we are not used to such things in the
woods there a promise is a promise and
i have given mine and would not break it
for all the cane that has ever been grown
for the rest i can only ask you again to
keep this matter to yourself it will be
enough to tell the general that i have re-
fused

  bowing stiffly the judge resumed his
chair he was beaten perhaps but he did
not show it indeed there was that about
him as he closed the interview which sug-
gested victory rather than defeat he was
like one who having encountered an un-
expected reverse is upheld by the cer-
tainty of ultimate success

  this is final he questioned

  it is msieu

  you will not have another chance

  i do not wish one msieu

  reaching out he touched a bell upon his
desk

  then i must bid you good morning
said he and a moment later i had fol-
lowed his clerk through the sound-proof
door

henshaw

  thus as they had begun judge cestias
efforts ended in failure yet for me at
least the experience was not unprofitable
true i rode off in a rage but once my
anger had cooled i came to look back on
the interview with an ever increasing sense
of enlightenment and relief gradually i
discovered that in his efforts to ensnare me
the judge had succeeded in setting me free

  for at last i realized the true meaning
of those acres at marsh island at last 
knew that in some vague half-conscious
way i had made them my goal all along
they had tempted me all along they had
touched my work in the woods with the
slow poison of discontent

  and this was not strange since these
acres had ever seemed to lie just beyond
my grasp had not le bossu said that they
were waiting for me had he not declared
that night beneath the stars that i would
have my chance at them some day and
the little man had been right

  in its own good time the long arm of the
general had reached out for me to dangle
this wondrous bribe before my eager eyes
for a space i had been caught and held
but in the end i had won free having
offered its all to no purpose the arm would
not reach out again

  it was over and no longer could i quar-
rel with my lot i was free wholly free
to finish the work that i had begun i
might not be a planter but at least i would
follow the way that i had chosen

  the thought of this brought peace to-
gether with a new tenderness for my friends
in the woods somehow it was as if they
had been returned to me again madame
alcide monsieur bonnemaison the little
doctor-in the weeks that followed i bound
them to me with fresh ties of love and ap-
preciation

  as for toinette i could only wait im-
patiently for the day of her return i
longed for her as i had never longed before
but beyond this was merely a sense of un-
easy confusion

  i only knew that as upon that first
christmas eve at the camp i had received
a lesson in values on the one hand had
been toinette on the other all the
breadth and fertility of marsh island
and i had made my choice without one
afterpang of regret it was something to
think about

  so i struggled blindly with these half-

romance

guessed thoughts and desires groping my
way toward the light that was so soon to
come

chapter xiv

i make the great discovery

with the ending of spring the time
approached for toinettes gradua-
tion to bois berard this was a memor-
able event since never before had the set-
tlement been represented at the convent
now toinette had come forward not with
a mere term but with four full years and
a diploma

  high and low the wood-folk were as
proudly elated as if they had played a
personal part in this achievement -had it
been possible they would have attended
the exercises in a body but the convent
was far away and was moreover wholly
guarded against such an onslaught there-
fore the inhabitants turned to madame al-
cide with the gifts and good wishes that
marked their appreciation

  monsieur bonnemaison impressed by
the religious atmosphere of the convent
and possibly confusing the occasion with
that of a first communion sent a prayer-
book of ivory with a rosary to match

  doctor poussard viewing the affair with
more worldly eyes had evidently been im-
pressed by its educational aspect his
offering a writing-set in a gaily painted
box was accompanied by a brief explana-
tion 

  he had meant to send a book he said
but his employer had forestalled him of
course a prayer-book was not exactly a
book but then in a way it was one at
all events it was something to read

  and madame alcide touched into
silence had allowed this to pass unchal-
lenged by a single come poussard

  in selecting my own gift i had wholly
ignored the demands of the occasion
wishing for something that would suggest
only the joy of possession i had finally de-
cided upon a small brooch it was of gold
set with tiny pearls and i felt sure of
toinettes pleasure since it would repre-
sent her first true ornament of value

  from the humbler folk came simpler
tokens a fan a ribbon a sacred picture or
image each of them delivered with a word

of praise and congratulation day by day
they kept coming until madame alcide de-
clared with a choke in her voice that achille
would never be able to bear such a burden
across the prairie

  looking on i thought rather grimly of
my interview with judge cestia so these
were the folk he would have had me spurn
from my high place upon the hilltop

  madame alcide of course gave the grad-
uation dress an intricate affair that was the
result of a prolonged study of some half-
dozen fashion-books each fold and ruffle
of this all-important garment had been
carefully worked out although at the last
the old lady lacked the hardihood to at-
tempt its actual creation

  it was too much for her she said she
could not depend upon herself to have it all
a la mode there was but one thing to do
and that was to invoke the assistance of
her relatives at st pierre she would go
to her sister-in-law madame octave who
of all the lavals held first place with her
needle she might be a little slow but
what was time in such an emergency give
her a week and she would produce a tri-
umph

  having arrived at this decision madame
alcide proceeded to arrange her plans with
the thoroughness that was my chief comfort
during these periods of desertion if it was
hard to lose her i at least had the satis-
faction of knowing exactly when she would
be back again

  you can expect me on the tenth day
jean said she there is the week for
the dress and a day for the exercises it is
too bad that you can not see them but it
would be as uncomfortable for you as for
the sisters afterward toinette will wish
to spend her last night at the convent as
is the custom then she must come for a
day at madame octaves next morning
we willbe off as early as we can get away

  following this announcement madame
alcide departed leaving me to consider cer-
tain plans of my own fortified by my
first and only visit to the convent i was
well content to miss the exercises but i
did not mean to miss toinette i was
anxious to see her and to see her before
she left st pierre

  my reasons for this were the outcome of
long weeks of thought and anticipation
always toinette had returned a different
being and her present homecoming was


nevil g henshaw

fraught with a particular importance this
time she was coming back to stay to es-
tablish the relations that would endure until
we announced our betrothal

  thus i felt that i must see this new
toinette amid the environment that was re-
sponsible for her newness then perhaps
i might glean some hint of the future i
might even learn the meaning of much that
had puzzled me in the years before

  thanks to madame alcide i could be
definite in my arrangements toinette i
knew would spend the ninth day at
madame octaves i had only to ride in on
that day and surprize her

  to this monsieur bonnemaison agreed
readily enough declaring that it would save
him the trouble of driving half-way to
davides store some papers were to be
delivered and i could leave them there on
my way home at that hour davide was
sure to be in

  accordingly i set out upon the appointed
morning and rode directly to the home of
madame octave which being upon the
prairie end of the town was sparsely
shaded by a scatter of china-trees the
house was of two stories and as i drew
up before it i caught in one of the upper
windows a brief glance of a girlish figure
next moment it was gone leaving me di-
vided between the regret of my discovery
and the satisfaction of losing my final
doubt toinette was in and she had evi-
dently hurried down to welcome me at
the door however my knock was answered
by madame alcide

  well jean she greeted me so you
could not stand my being away this time
or did bonnemaison send you in
toinette i asked my doubts return-
ing she is here

  at this the old lady smiled although her
eyes held a sudden look of inquiry

  i see said she so it was not myself
or even bonnemaison yes toinette is
here and you will see her in a moment
but first you must meet madame octave
following her inside i entered the par-
lor a room furnished in red plush and
hung with heavy curtains to assist the half-
hearted efforts of the china-trees here i
was introduced to stout placid madame
octave who blinked at me kindly through
the heavy glasses to which she had been
doomed by her fine and incessant needle-
work

  afterward i sat and listened to an ac-
count of the exercises delivered in the
main by madame alcide and in part by
madame octave who supplied innumerable
small details

                                                   

  it was wonderful how much madame oc-
tave had observed one would never have
guessed the power of those eyes behind
their thick lenses

  everything had gone off well the
bishop himself had been present and now
for a surprize toinette had been valedic-
torian knowing it for weeks she had kept
it secret until the very day itself think
of it it was incredible

  to all this i replied politely if briefly
my eyes upon the door i was glad that
toinette had been valedictorian but i was
not surprized it was natural for her to
lead sh had always done so

  and besides i cared little for the exer-
cises i was there to see toinette what
was keeping her i wondered it seemed
that she would never come

  and then all at once she was there
framed in the shadows of the doorway with
the suddenness of an apparition she was
dressed all in soft billowy white and at my
look she sprang forward reaching out eager
hands

  jean jean she cried this is the
best of all and if i kept you waiting it
was that you might see me as i was yester-
day this is the dress jean is it not
lovely

  it must have been lovely that gradua-
tion-dress of fleecy muslin i can not say
despite the painstaking care of madame
octave i gave it not so much as a single
glance my eyes were all for toinette for
the flush of her cheek the light of her
eyes the dark burnished glory of her hair

  that she was beautiful i know far far
too beautiful for any words and as i
looked at her i felt suddenly queer and
dizzy with a strange dryness about my
mouth that prevented me from uttering a
sound for one age-long moment i was
supremely happy the next i was afraid

  perhaps this is but a poor description of
my awakening at all events it is a true
one i can recall each sensation perfectly
i can picture the scene the proud look of
madame alcide the abrupt upward glance
of madame octave the slim white figure
of toinette poised smiling before me all
jean trouve	

of it vague and shadowy in the half-light
of the curtained room

  and this is how i came to love toinette
instantly violently for all the world as if
the meeting were our first one the reason
for this i know no more than others in
like circumstances perhaps it was the
dress my weeks of longing who can say

  yet i have always felt that despite our
years of companionship mine was true love
at first sight it is said that love is blind
with me it was only through love that my
eyes were opened to the real toinette a
toinette hitherto unguessed and unseen

  striving desperately i finally forced my
dry throat to a word of greeting then 
returned to my chair while toinette seat-
ing herself across from me took up the tale
of her graduation

  with her it was the gifts over which she
was as delighted as if they had arrived only
that morning my brooch was the best
she could never thank me for it see she
had it on and the other things from the
woods she wished for arms a mile long
so that tomorrow she might embrace all
bois berard in one great hug

  then there was le bossu not only had
he kept his promise by coming to see her
but he had brought with him a great bunch
of yellowlegs as a remembrance from the
marsh was not that like him yes he
was as at the bridge now where he was
overhauling his boat in preparation for the
bay

  here was good news and t declared that
i would ride out to see the little man at my
first opportunity

  this done i listened absently while
toinette chattered on helped out by her
aunts from time to time somehow i did
not object to the presence of the aunts
just then i had no wish to have toinette to
myself i wanted to be alone to take as
it were a mental stock of the situation

  it seemed that my visit would never end
falling in love was a wholly strange and
uncomfortable experience such replies as
i made were confined to an occasional yes
and no my one wish was to get away

  and so when i could stand it no longer
i arose declaring that i must hurry off
there were the papers for davide to say
nothing of certain commissions in st
pierre begging the aunts not to rise i
bade them farewell then followed by
toinette i made for the door

  outside in the hall toinette turned away
to reach my hat from the rack it was an
old hat a special favorite yet from that
moment i disowned it i must do better
now i told myself

  then toinette spoke the hat held high in
a gesture of mock ceremony

  you have been so nice jean that i will
crown you she began and to-mor-
row-

  she had faced about now to stare at me
the hat swinging wildly from the sudden
drop of her hands

  why jean she exclaimed in a voice
that was almost a whisper

  the next moment her hands were in mine
and i was crushing them hat and all

  toinette toinette i gulped unable
to utter another word

  yes jean said toinette and as she
spoke her eyes answered mine as truly and
as fully as if they had cried their message
aloud

  then madame alcide appeared calling
to me from the parlor doorway

  the flour jean she directed you
will see that there is enough remember
it will not be for one or two but for three

  yes madame i replied and after
that there was nothing for it but to make
good my haste of a while before

  so i departed twisting about in my sad-
dle that i might see to the last the white
sunlit figure that waved to me from mad-
ame octaves front gallery

  once out of sight i swung back to the
prairie where i turned over all matters of
route and speed to rouge that i might
give myself entirely to the joy and wonder
of the moment

  i had made the great discovery i loved
toinette and what was of infinitely more
importance toinette loved me there
could be no doubt of this there was no
misreading the message of her eyes

  love was curious i decided it was so
wholly unexpected there it had come to
me like a flash despite the years despite
even the presence of the aunts one would
not have looked for it at such a moment
now at the time of my proposal-

  but i did not dwell upon this i was not
proud of that proposal through it i
would be forced to explain many things to
toinette it was better to go back to that
brief parting in the hall

  and so i went on throughout the after-
	nevil g

noon leaving a sorely puzzled rouge to
pick his way across the short grass of the
prairie

  near sunset i recalled my commission
and set out in a definite direction at
davides i delivered the papers refusing
on account ol the hour the inevitable offer
of coffee then as i passed out to the store
porch there came a tug at my coat ac-
companied by a voice that babbled in
vague entreaty

  you will help me msieu it droned
you will help me i am no beggar once
i had a place like this of my own

  the voice rose sharpened to a sudden
edge of hate

  it was msieu the general it cried
always msieu the general but it is
near my settlement

  davide swore impatiently

  you see said he he gets worse
that one his is no idle threat he should
be restrained he is not the fool that he
looks

  and he added advancing upon the hud-
dled figure

  get out dugas before i put you out
would you drive away my trade

  but i in my new-found happiness
stepped in between also i slipped a coin
into monsieur dugas outthrust palm for
all his evil i could not deny him had he
not played his unwilling part in bringing
me to toinette also he was terribly pun-
ished as for his threats they were ridicu-
lous what could he do against the gen-
eral

  the general and monsieur dugas back
in the saddle i dismissed these ancient
enemies with a confident smile how i had
feared them and now they were helpless
the one denied by me in turn the other
touched by the hand of god

  with the thought came a sense of tri-
umph it seemed a fit ending for that
glorious afternoon the general and mon-
sieur dugas now indeed was i free of
them they had hadtheir day tomor-
row was mine with toinette

chapter xv
i come to judgment

next day when i awoke at sunrise it
was to a sense of gladness very vague
and elusive like the first pale hints of dawn

henshaw

for a space i wa content to lie there
steeped in a drowsy joy it was enough to
know that all was well with me why seek
for troublesome causes

  then as the light increased my
thoughts took shape-bright eager
thoughts touched like the light with the
golden promise of midday toinette was
coming i would see her at noon even
now she must be up and making ready

  thus i began a seemingly endless day
though i added to my work the neglected
duties of the day before the hours dragged
interminably having started with toi-
nette in my thoughts i continued by at-
tempting to follow her in her drive across
the prairie

  now she had left st pierre now ages
later she was crossing the big coulee and
now though she ought really to be in sight
of the woods she was probably half-way
at davides

  but upon looking at my watch i would
find that i was wrong she could hardly
have reached the coulee

  so it went throughout the morning
then when my round was all but finished
an event occurred that robbed me of my
impatience it was a runaway at a dis-
tant farm the sudden bolting of a half-
broken team a cart was smashed a horse
was cut a man badly bruised and shaken

  then came the applying of remedies the
clearing of the wreck the calming of the
excited tenants once this was done it
was long past noon and my problem was
no longer one of killing time but-of making
the most of it

  yet when at last i raced back to the
settlement it was to find that the travelers
had barely arrived as i swung in to the
wood-road they were still plodding the
last few yards of their journey

  hola i cried and dug in my spurs
bearing down upon the surrey from behind
then as i reached it i stared aghast for
the seat beside madame alcide was empty

  toinette i cried all greetings forgot-
ten where is toinette madame

  the old lady did not at once reply as
she was absorbed in making the turn into
her stableyard

  wait said she when this was accom-
plished i will tell you inside

  she spoke shortly almost gruffly drop-
ping the reins and allowing achille to come
to a stop of his own free will and this was
jean trouve



not madame alcides way always she
drew up with a flourish accompanied by her
cheery we have arrived

  slipping from the saddle i helped her to
the ground where she stood in silence
waiting for her parcels to be taken out

  what is it madame i begged as i
piled them into her arms but she only
shook her head before turning away

  in the unhitching that followed i made
record time indeed i fairly tore the har-
ness from achilles ancient frame after
which i set off at a run for the house

  here i found no bustle and clatter of
homecoming as in former days in the
dining-room madame alcide was waiting
for me sitting rigidly erect in her accus-
tomed chair she still wore her sunbonnet
and before her the parcels lay unopened
upon the table

  sit down jean she ordered as soon as
i had come in certain things have hap-
pened and it is necessary that we consider
them

  she spoke quietly now yet her voice held
a note of grimness that hinted at unpleasant
things to come when i seated myself
across the table it was upon the extreme
edge of my chair already i felt as if i
were on trial

  and now to start went on madame
alcide we will begin with last summer

  she waited as if for some word from me
and when this did not come her voice rose
in sharp interrogation

  why did you do it she demanded

  it was not easy to reply i had come to
judgment as i feared

  then-then toinette had told you i
floundered you mean my my pro-
posal

  proposal echoed madame alcide and
her voice bit in like acid you call it a
proposal to say to a girl i wish you to
marry me but i do not know the reason
why

  and toinette did not tell me this or at
least she did not think she did it was
hard enough to make her admit anything
even after she knew that i knew she is
that kind

  but you jean i am surprized at you
to think of your doing this just when she
was having her good time

  i am sorry madame said l i know
that it is not much to say so but i am

 and i am sorrier still that you object so
 much i feared that you would

   i spoke with a sincerity that brought an
 instant reward when madame alcide
 went on it was in a kindlier tone

   bien jean said she if you say that
 you are sorry and i believe you it is the
 best that you can do now also you make
 too much of my objections it would have
 been all right in time i had hoped for it
 later on but now not knowing each other
 and with toinette in the convent why
 it was the one thing i feared the one thing
 that i fought against

   but i will tell you something you re-
 member that winter when you asked me if
 toinette was beautiful it was then that
 i began to be afraid i kept toinette away
 the following summer it was not the les-
 sons as i said it was you jean and i
 would have kept her away last summer had
 i not missed her so i told myself that it
 would be all right

   so now perhaps you understand i
 wanted it but in proper time you were
 like brother and sister it would not have
 lasted a year

   there fell a silence during which i con-
 sidered what madame alcide had said all
 her thought and care made as nothing by
 my blind impatience

   but fortunately my mistake was not past
 mending though it was not easy i has-
 tened to set it aright

   i understand madame said i also
 although i love toinette truly now i will
 follow your wish it will be hard to wait

 yet if you say so-

   a moment interrupted madame al-
 cide when i have finished it will be
 time for you to plan we have only dealt
 with thing number one now we come to
 thing number two which takes us back to
 your first days with me

   she paused leaning forward and added
 in a voice of stern accusation

   why did you hide behind a name then
 why did you not tell me who you really
 were

   it was like the pointblank firing of a
 shot for a space i could only gape at her
 foolishly now indeed had i come to judg-
  ment

   so you knew i finally managed to

   no answered madame alcide grimly
 that is just it i did not know of course


w e v i l g

henshaw

i saw at first glance that you were no
marsh-rat otherwise you would not have
come into my home and later with your
cane i saw clearer still you wished to be
a planter and you began as one it opened
my eyes

   so i said to myself the blood is
better than i thought i even hinted as
much to you that first day in the field
but the grandson of msieu the general
it was too much how could i have
guessed it

  but you knew jean and you did not
tell me and why that is what i want
to know

  by now i had recovered some part of my
composure yet i could find no defense for
my action viewed in the light of what
madame alcide had said it seemed wholly
stupid and useless why had i not told
her why had i not told all bois berard
for that matter since the need for secrecy
had been long past

  it would have been the same anyway
such things were bound to come out it
was like me to see this now when it was too
late

  it is hard to answer you madame
said i at last i do not know why i did
this myself at first it was necessary to
have another name i had run away and
i was scared afterward i kept on it
was habit perhaps i can not say it was
not that i did not trust you had i
thought of it i woujd have told you gladly
but there seemed no need

  at this madame alcide laughed a short
hard laugh in which there was no trace of
merriment

  no need she repeated so there
seemed no need jean listen now to thing
number three yesterday within half an
hour of your departure we had a second
visitor it was judge cestia and he asked
for toinette and myself to us he told
your story ending it with his offer of last
winter-the offer that you refused

  and afterward he made an appeal he
was very polite but he was also very plain
he could do nothing with you he said he
had tried his best and he had failed it
was not pleasant to say what he must say
now but he had no choice it all rested
with toinette your grandfather needed
you and marsh island was a very great
estate if toinette would only step
aside-

  she halted as if in sudden distaste and
her face flushed darkly beneath the shadow
of the sunbonnet

  but why say more she finished
surely you can see jean

  and i did see through a dull haze of
anger such as i had never known of which
i was almost afraid

  so that was it well might the old lady
be upset and judge cestia how he had
tricked using my confidence to shame the
ones i loved no wonder he had seemed
assured in that moment of apparent defeat
even then like some clever gambler he
had held and hidden this final card

  and toinette unconsciously i spoke
the name aloud

  toinette had gone back to the con-
vent answered madame alcide promptly
she will stay there until you are safe with
your grandfather

  again her words brought anger but of a
different kind

  so said i bitterly then that is how
she cares for me she says that she loves
me and she runs away

  i would have gone on but madame al-
cide turned upon me with the fierceness of
utter exasperation

  bon dieu she cried have you no
sense at all jean do you imagine that
it was easy for toinette to go for me to
send her suppose you were in her place
suppose you loved her as she loves you
could you do anything else would there
be any other way

  just the same i will find a way i per-
sisted i will ride in at once-

  and to what purpose challenged
madame alcide  you will not see
toinette and if you did it would be no
use she is not coming back even though
she tried to i would not allow it

  for the rest this has been forced upon
me i have no choice in the matter if
as you do not deny you are giving up
marsh island for toinette what can i do
but prevent it

  madame- i began but the old lady
paid no heed

  see she went on i will be frank
with you at first i was very angry there
was your betrothal the hiding of your
name and judge cestias offer i thought
that you had deceived me that you had
laughed at me but i wished to make sure
jean trouve



that is why i took my time questioning
you carefully

  now i believe that you meant no un-
fairness that you were foolish thoughtless
but nothing more yet the result is tha
same

  and perhaps this is for the best you
are young jean you do not know your
own mind also as judge cestia said
marsh island is a very great estate

  i have thought of all that i put in
i have considered it carefully

  bien agreed madame alcide we
will let it pass then we will say that you
have gone on and married that you have
never repented your bargain what then
of toinette

  your mother tried this and you have
shown me her picture consider her eyes
their look that one never forgets they
puzzle me those eyes only yesterday
when i heard her story did i understand

  it is regret jean-regret for what she
cost your father she could not help it
women are like that and what would
you do to keep such a look from toinettes
eyes in the years to come

  the look will not come said i
doggedly what is greater than love
there is duty answered madame al-
cide my duty to see that you do not make
this mistake your duty to take that which
your father lost then there is your duty
to me so long as you stay here so long
must toinette keep away and toinette is
my niece it is not easy to say this

  her voice broke and suddenly she rose
to her feet coming around the table to my
chair a moment she stood gazing down
at me and in her eyes was the same wistful
yearning that had marked my last day with
madame therese

  this is hard jean said she slowly
harder for me perhaps than for you
you are young with much before you i
am old and the wound will lake long to
heal for i will miss you jean you have
been like a son to me-a good son always

  yesterday when judge cestia told me
of your refusal i was proud of you it
was foolish yes but i loved you for it as
i ever will and then there is what you
have been doing with bonnemaison it is a
secret i know but i am not blind all
along it has been for me and now-to
have you go-

  words failed her and she turned abrupt-
ly moving stiffly away to her room

  when she had gone i sat for a long time
staring vacantly at the scarred surface of
the table slowly the first shock of my
anger spent itself allowing me to consider
my position

  i was snared i was trapped and in my
own home the very members of my
household had been turned against me
and all for a thoughtless omission for a
secrecy born perhaps of my lonely child-
hood

  well it only meant that i must fight
and i was used to fighting i had done so
before i could do so again but how

  madame alcide i dismissed immediately
there was no doubting the finality of what
she had said judge cestia had hurt her
terribly and to her pride was added her
sense of duty it would never be said of
her that she had used her niece to despoil
the grandson of msieu the general

  toinette was still less promising i
could see that now my anger cooled i
could even imagine her point of view all
her life she had been used to sacrifice and
she believed that she stood in my way
what else could she do and even were
it otherwise she was helpless until she
was of age she must obey madame alcide

  thusbut one course was left open to me
i must take the war into the enemys camp
and that enemy was my grandfather for
all his cleverness judge cestia did not
count he was merely an agent

  with the thought cartie inspiration
since the general had done this thing he
could also undo it

  what if i went to him apd convinced him
that i would never return what if after-
ward he spoke to madame alcide surely
his word would be enough surely he
could make her understand once she saw
that toinette could not deprive me of
something that i had definitely refused she
would be forced to give in

  perhaps with my knowledge of the gen-
eral it wasthe sheerest madness perhaps
upon reflection i would have realized the
implied weakness of such an attack

  but it was a chance and in the code of
the woods chances called for action rather
than thought also there was little time
if i would see it through that day

  five minutes later i was pounding down
the wood-road at a pace that would have
o	nevil g

  caused old syprien lalandre himself to
  stare in surprize

chapter xvi

the general

 thanks to my talks with monsieur
 bonnemaison i knew something of
 the generals habits it was his custom in
 the late afternoon to go over the affairs of
 his estate

    thus upon reaching the island i did not
  keep on to his house dismounting half-
  way up the hill i tied rouge to a live oak
  and made my second descent upon the vine-
  covered office

    when i had knocked and been bidden to
  enter i found the single room wholly un-
  changed there was the same film of dust
  the same orderly litter the same prim ar-
  rangement of chairs safe and table the
  general was seated as before but this time
  he straightened up at once from the book
  of accounts over which he had been bend-
  ing there was something in the movement
  that hinted at eagerness almost at satis-
  faction yet he spoke with his usual cold
  precision

   well john he began have you
 come to your senses at last

    i did not attempt to parley now that
  i was before him i found that i must speak
  out at once if i were to speak at all

    yes msieu i replied i have come
  to my senses that is why i am here to
  ask you to make amends

    at this the general stiffened but he did
  not lose his level tone

    if you will be so kind i should like to
  know exactly what you mean said he

    there was something in his words that
  stung me to instant anger

    i mean what you have had judge cestia
  do-his going to my people his driving
  them away from me i answered hotly
  and for what  am not coming back
  you must understand this no matter
  what happens i will not come

    the general did not reply to this at once
  for a time he merely stared at me as if i
  were some strange specimen about which
  he could not quite make up his mind his
  tolerance was as unexpected as it was de-
  moralizing i had looked for anger deri-
  sion-anything save this calm appraisal

h e n s - a w

  your people he mused finally you
are a queer one john and your talk
about not coming back is equally as orig-
inal how could you come back when you
have never been here

  he spoke without scorn or irony in-
deed his attitude was one of interest mild
and half-amused having never known
him in this mood i was utterly unprepared
to deal with him i could reply only by
reminding him that i had come to him once
and that he had sent me away

  at this his look of inquiry gave place to
one of enlightenment it was as if he had
classified his specimen at last

  i see said he so you have held this
against me all these years

  how could i do otherwise i retorted

  a moment the general appeared to hesi-
tate the next he leaned forward as if in
sudden resolution

  listen john said he age brings
wisdom and wisdom brings regrets per-
haps you feel that an explanation is due
you at all events you shall have one

  when you came to me i was still
smarting from a half-healed wound the
sight of you reopened it and so in a mo-
ment of anger i sent you away afterward
when i wanted you back i found that you
had gone it took a long time to find you

  in that time my interest waned i am a
busy man with few opportunities for sen-
timent if you had stayed on the marsh
i would probably have forgotten you en-
tirely you see  am being perfectly frank
with you

  but you came to the woods and put in
your cane not with your hands but from
the saddle that aroused my interest
again it appeared that you might be a
marsh after all

  and so i rode in for a look at you that
day at the store and found that you were
the image of-your father

  he brought out the last words with an
effort wincing as if from some sharp thrust
of memory and at this moment he was
a being far removed from the harsh auto-
crat of marsh island he was merely a
lonely pld man worn and harassed by the
years disillusions

  after that i determined to have you
he continued if you had come to me as
my manager the arrangement would not
have lasted a week i only wanted to make
sure

  but you -refused and i went to cestia
i was afraid to trust myself i had tried
it before unsuccessfully the rest you
know

  he paused and once more his look was
inquiring

  well he challenged my cards are
on the table

  i am sorry msieu said i after what
you have said i would come back gladly if
it were possible but there is toinette i
am betrothed to her

  and i am your grandfather put in the
general is not your blood thicker than
water

  you do not understand msieu i ex-
plained i love toinette we were
brought up together i could not go on
without her

that is what you think now said the
general i have lived a long time and i
can promise you that in less than six
months you will have changed your mind
and he added generously

  the girl is all right i grant you that
according to cestia she has beauty and re-
finement and she has behaved very well in
this matter but it will not do i have
other plans for you

  his calmness was wholly disarming
why would he not lose his temper allow-
ing me to force my demands somehow i
felt as if i had been removed a vast dis-
tance from my original intention if this
kept up i would never be able to get back
to it again

  and what of my plans i demanded
are they not to be considered at all

  for the first time the generals voice held
a note of irony

  only in so far as you are able to carry
them out

  and if i do so

  that is impossible

  and why

  because you can not your very being
here proves it

  he finished with open triumph evi-
dently he was sure of himself now or
perhaps he had become weary of his effort
it must have cost him something this hard-
won repression born of the promptings of
experience he had been very patient and
now he reaped his reward where i had
meant to demand i could only appeal

  then if that is so msieu said i i
can only throw myself upon your mercy

  also since i am not coming back you will
  gain little by refusing me you will lose
  me my friends my home it will mean
  nothing more 

    as for my coming here i did so to ask
  you if you would not speak for me to
  madame berard she will listen to you
  you can convince her a word from you
  will be enough

    the general accepted this with a gravity
  that was wholly misleading

   and may i ask what i am to say to
 her he inquired

    that i am not coming back that it is
  useless to keep toinette away i explained
  eagerly anything will do just so it is
  said by yourself

    and you expect me to do this pursued
  the general

    you must msieu you must i cried
  it is only a little thing yet it means my
  happiness

    there came a faint twitching at the cor-
  ners of the generals mouth he had had
  his fun of the situation and now in his
  grim way he paid tribute to it

   by george but you are a wonder
 john he muttered half to himself

    then i understood with a dull sense of
  hurt that was rather the outcome of in-
  justice than of disappointment to me it
  seemed the very refinement of cruelty

    so you refuse i began

    of course he broke in bitingly and
  the day will come when you will thank me
  for it

    without further protest i arose it was
  no use and i was in no mood to argue

    yet i did not mean to leave without a
  final word if i had lost i would not slink
  away in silent defeat and then there was
  that cold impassive mask of the generals

 perhaps i could not get in behind it but i
would leave him something to think about

    bien msieu said i deliberately you
  have won and i wish you joy of your vic-
  tory at least i have stood against you
  man to man i have not fought through
  another against women

    it was useless insolent yet-it had its ef-
  fect instantly the general was up and
  facing me in trembling white-hot fury

    and as i looked at him the years slipped
  away and it seemed that i was a child
  again staring with round frightened eyes
  as i groped for a forgotten name the
  sudden hush the menacing form the

             romance 
strange yet familiar interior-save for one
missing figure it was my vision of msieu
abraham

  and then as if to make it complete the
door creaked open and monsieur dugas
entered the room

chapter xvii

monsieur dugas

he slipped in so smoothly so
quietly that his presence was be-
trayed only by the squeak of the rusty
hinges at first glance he seemed very piti-
ful and harmless a mere filthy bundle of
rags then as he turned toward the table
his attitude declared itself

  though he cringed and shuffled as of
old it was with some strange new quality
of abasement now his movements were
informed with purpose-stark deadly pur-
pose that seemed fairly to cry itself aloud
even before i caught sight of the weapon
in his hand i had divined his mission

  it was an ugly weapon-a squat heavy
revolver of the sort known as bulldog also
it was at full-cock the hammer poised and
ready like some waiting fang

  but worst of all was its unspeakable age
and foulness though hidden i knew that
its bullets were green and rank with ver-
digris i had seen such bulldogs such bul-
lets cast aside and forgotten in the gun-
shops of st pierre

  all this i caught in monsieur dugas
brief advance from door to table arriving
there he raised his arm and brought down
the bull-dog upon the tabletop he did
this very carefully and methodically as if
it were something that he had rehearsed a
number of times then he spoke holding
the bulldog with a steady hand

  i have come for my settlement msieu
said he

  his words held no threat or challenge
merely the same dogged purpose that had
marked his approach and having spoken
he waited with the calmness of perfect as-
surance though bulldogs were notori-
ously inaccurate he had placed himself
beyond the possibility of failure there
could be no miss at that pointblank range

  knowing this only too well the general
moved not so much as a muscle he had
seated himself at the opening of the door

so that the bulldog now pointed directly at
his chest with so broad a mark presented
it was useless to duck or dodge

  also since monsieur dugas finger was-
on the trigger there was no chance of a
sudden spring it was an impossible situa-
tion and the general accepted it with a
dignity a composure beyond belief

  yet all the time he was fighting gamely
with the only weapons at his command
once at a circus i had seen a trainer sub-
due a refractory leopard he had done so
without force or speech solely by the power
of his gaze and this was what the general
was doing boring into monsieur dugas
slow determination with eyes that were like
flecks of polished steel

  i will never forget those eyes there
was no fear in them no uncertainty only
the calm imperative force of a dominant
personality though the general spoke
his words were superfluous they seemed
merely some trifling accompaniment to that
steady merciless gaze

  put down your pistol dugas he di-
rected put it down at once

  and he added to me without moving his
eyes

  steady john you can do nothing
here

  i marveled that monsieur dugas could
stand it that his scattered wits should
allow his forthcoming reply but then he
had lived only for this moment there
had been plenty of time to prepare himself
in those long empty days upon the prairie

  no i will not put down my pistol
msieu he answered it was too hard
to get i could not buy it i could not
take it i had to break in after it like a
thief when i have had my settlement
yes until then no all along you have
been after me now it is my turn

  he droned to a close and the duel went
on again the dreadful silent duel be-
tween madness and indomitable reason it
was heart-breaking it was unendurable
i fought down an impulse to rush in
screaming why did not monsieur dugas
shoot and end it yet how could he with
those eyes

  it seemed an age before the change came
and even then it was very slight and subtle
a faint relaxation upon the part of mon-
sieur dugas sensed rather than seen his
shoulders twitched his hand trembled
jean trouve



perhaps it was merely the natural reflex
from an intolerable strain

  but it was enough for the general
slowly majestically he arose his eyes
never losing their clutch upon the mad-
mans will

  give me that pistol dugas he com-
manded

  and then it happened the backward
start the jerk of the finger the sudden re-
port sounding doubly thunderous in the
smallness of the room yet i have never
believed that monsieur dugas fired inten-
tionally mad though he was he could
not have done so beneath that gaze

  that he was beaten i am sure only in
defeat and in the confusion of surrender
did he accomplish his purpose

  with the crash of the bulldog i sprang
reaching out blindly to prevent a second
shot but monsieur dugas was too quick
for me in a flash he had twisted aside
to fire again then dodging back with in-
credible swiftness he disappeared through
the half-opened door

  at once i plunged after him but the
general recalled me

  let him go he ordered they will
catch him soon enough

  and so i turned back to him to find that
he had collapsed into his chair he looked
terribly gray and crumplkl and one hand
was pressed tightly below the level of his
waist

  you are badly hurt msieu i ques-
tioned

  i am done for-shot through the mid-
dle he answered quietly and you

  only then did i look down and realize
that i had been hit in the excitement of
the moment i had felt  shock

  through the shoulder i muttered
half-fascinated by the slow welling of
blood i do not think that it is much

  for a space the general fought his agony
his tormented eyes roaming restlessly
about then all at once they came to a
stop and his free hand rose weakly to
point to a corner of the room

  pay attention john said he this
is important in the safe there you will
fino the original of the will that cestia
showed you it is all in order just as i
finished it upon the day i determined to
have you here

  he waited panting and went on

  it was not for this although i had

been warned i did not expect it i merely
wished to secure you in case of accident
but msieu i began utterly over-
whelmed i can not-toinette-

  live your life he interrupted shortly
the will is unconditional

  he waited again and added with a touch
of his old intolerance

  if i had lived it would have been dif-
ferent i would never have given in and
you would have come here you may rest

assured of that as it is-

  his voice died out and he lay back gasp-
ing his eyes fixed dully upon the tattered
flag above the mantel

  life is strange he murmured i went
through shiloh for thig	

  he fell silent and once more i tried to
speak to him uttering vague stammered
fragments of protest of uncertainty i
scarce knew what but he broke in at
once declaring that we understood each
other that it was all settled that i was a
marsh and he would expect me to be one

  he spoke harshly impatiently yet i
have always felt that at that moment and
in his fierce old way he was very near to
me at least he had said that we under-
stood each othar and this meant much
from the general

  afterward there was a strained uncom-
fortable pause which was broken by the
sound of footsteps outside at the door
they hesitated and a young rr  atto peered
uncertainly in

  youre all right general he ques-
tioned its mighty late and they said

they was some shots-

  he choked silent as his eyes became ac-
customed to the smoke-laden twilight of the
room

  oh my gawd he began on a rising
scream	

  quiet paul ordered the general i
am hurt and so is his gentleman my
grandson it was dugas you get the
name dugas send at once for the doctor
and notify the sheriff then hurry back
with help

  it spoke well for the generals training
that paul hesitated no longer in an in-
stant he was gone shouting as he went

  of what followed i remember little for
by now i had bled a great deal and my

head was beginning to go round

  thus when the footsteps returned and
the room became suddenly filled with ex-

cited servants i could only try to lurch
forward in the general direction of the
table then my feet went out from under
me and i fell through vast swirling depths
of blackness into merciful oblivion

chapter xviii

afterward

afterward i was very ill of the
generals death which occurred that
night of his huge stately funeral of the
capture and confinement of monsieur
dugas i knew nothing for many days

  true i came to myself soon after being
removed from the office and insisted upon
being taken home to the woods but the
doctor refused giving me a draft that sent
me back into unconsciousness again

  next day it was the same i must not
even move about in bed they told me
there was the chance of fever of infection
i must keep perfectly quiet until this
danger was past

   so i was forced to lie there feeling very
strange and lonely in the great testered bed
which took me back to my fathers room
and the days of the rue bourbon

  from my friends in the woods came mes-
sages of sympathy and assurance but i
did not see them they were timid folk in
that great house and it was not for them
to disobey the doctors command yet i
felt that if i did riot soon see a familiar
face i would go mad it was bad enough
to suffer as i was suffering now with my
shoulder it was too much to do so alone

  at last in my extremity i thought of le
bossu toinette had said that he was at
the bridge perhaps if i sent for him he
would manage to come to me at least he
would try and when the little man tried
he seldom failed

  in the end after much careful planning
and waiting i sent out my summons by
paul who having been the generals body-
servant was only too anxious to serve a
new master and le bossu came gaining
entrance past my door in his own peculiar
way

  so jean said he with his quiet smile
then dugas has been mistreating you
again we must make the best of it as we
did before

afterward he took charge declaring that

he had not come to visit me but to nurse
me and the doctor observing the effi-
ciency of his methods the effect of his
presence allowed him to remain

  thereupon he became a fixture at my
bedside ruling me with a quiet insistence
that was not to be denied

   i must not move so much as a finger
this was no mosquito-bite but a deep hole
with a chunk of lead at the end and a
dirty chunk at that if i squirmed about
the dirt might be worse than the lead

   his warning was justified when upon the
third day blood-poisoning set in after
this for a long time i raved in ceaseless
delirium in many ways it was like my
sickness at bayou portage there was the
same careful nursing by le bossu the
-same frightful visions even the same vague
sense of a rescuing hand to draw me back
in moments of dire peril

  and as before the hand was ever the
same very cool and soft and caressing-
the hand of toinette it stayed me it
comforted me it made possible my final
recovery but for it i could never have
resisted the dark malevolent tide that drew
me toward extinction

   and yet when at last i was myself again
and could look about me there was no
toinette it had been a dream after all
cruelly disappointed i questioned le
bossu who reassured me with promises
for the future toinette was all right
she had sent me a thousand messages i
would see her as soon as i was well enough

   it was not much yet i clung to it nurs-
ing my strength so that toinette might the
sooner arrive but when finally i was fit
for visitors it was madame alcide who
came very grave and tender and laden
with certain delicacies of which she knew i
was fond to my anxious questioning she
also replied evasively

   toinette was not well she had worked
too hard no it was nothing to worry
about but just now she must not risk a
long drive in the sun of course she would
come as soon as she was able in the
meantime i must be patient

   it was poorly done for madame alcide
was ill used to concealment when she
had gone i gave up toinette might come
but it would not be the coming for which
i longed

   that she did not care for me as i wished
was plain that she was taking this means

jtsromance
jean trouve



of impressing me with the fact was plainer
still otherwise she would never have de-
serted me in my hour of need

  had i been well and wholly myself i
might have sought other reasons as it
was i became obsessed with the idea that
i had lost toinette that without her the
future held nothing for me

  what if i owned marsh island what
if as judge cestia assured me i was now
not only a planter but the planter of the
parish all this meant nothing in my
present mood

  as for the judge i gave him full charge
of my affairs until such time as i could
look after them myself he was very kind
and considerate and with my sickness my
former hostility had vanished after all
he had merely served the interests of one
of his numerous clients

  in the days that followed i saw no more
of madame alcide her visit had upset
me and it was thought best that she should
not return but monsieur bonnemaison
came driving out upon the first available
sunday with doctor poussard

  it was good to see them to hear mon-
sieur bonnemaisons glowing account of
affairs the crop was wonderful never
had he seen such a stand i would have
my hands full in grinding it

  for the rest he had missed me terribly
at first it had seemed impossible to go on
even now he felt the need of a partner
and he was considering poussard what
did i think of it himself for the cane
poussard for the store

  and the little doctor declaring that it
was too much surveyed me with shining
eyes while i voiced my approval of this
combination

  later when i could go outside the other
wood-folk arrived they came fearfully in
groups tiptoeing upon the gallery to gaze
at me in silent awe as if i were some
strange exalted being upon whom they were
looking for the first time

  and as i watched them i understood
that judge cestia had been right and that
i had indeed gone up on the hill far far
away from these former friends of mine i
might see them greet them speak with
them but they could no longer play a part
in my life even with madame alcide
monsieur bonnemaison the little doctor it
would be much the same

  of them all there had been but one who

could have entered fully into this new life
of mine and i had lost her the loneliness
of it was unspeakable they were all gone
save le bossu and soon i must lose him

  more than once i had protested against
the little mans kindness only to receive the
same reply he had started this business
he meant to finish it when i was well
enough it would be time to think of
leaving

  so i had kept him on beyond his period
of nursing absolving my selfishness with
the thought of my necessity for in those
final weeks of convalescence le bossu had
become more necessary to me than ever
he was my confidant my adviser and
above all my comforter

  but now that i was up and able to move
about i felt that in fairness i could no
longer keep him he had had a long siege
of it and he was plainly hovnesick

  perhaps he was tired he admitted and
although he had been very comfortable it
would be nice to sleep beneath the stars
again suppose he began by looking over
his boat and laying in supplies then if
everything was all right he would leave

  accordingly after three days of prepara-
tion le bossu came to me to say good-by
all was in readiness and he would sail with
the afternoon tide there was much that
i had meant to tell him yet at the last mo-
ment i could only gulp out bossu

  but the little man understood patting
me upon the shoulder in his old way

  that is all right jean said he
what use are the lips when the heart is
speaking only send for me if you need
me and i will be satisfied i will always
be ready and waiting for your word

  and one thing more be a man you
have come to a high place and many are
dependent upon you remember it is not
your happiness but theirs that must count

  so he left me alone with my duty

chapter xix

the hilltop

that afternoon when i could stand
my loneliness no longer i had paul
move a chair to the outer edge of the hill-
top here i seated myself beneath an oak
looking out across the marsh toward a well-
remembered bayou it was too early for
my purpose-i must wait

---- romance --
r



nevil g henshaw

  in course of time a certain boat would
pass out along the bayou bound for the
bay from my lofty perch i could follow
it far as it twisted its way to open water
perhaps when it was just below me i
might even glimpse a figure in the cock-pit
thus i would see my last of le bossu ere
he returned to the old free life of the wild

   so i waited my eyes fixed hungrily upon
the marsh my back turned squarely to
those acres that were now my own

   ah to be free again to roam these other
trackless acres secure in the knowledge
that toinette would be waiting for me at
the door of the hut that was living

   perhaps it was all very childish and un-
reasonable yet there was some excuse for
me i was young i had been very ill and
my life seemed utterly empty thus when
at last my head went down into my hands
i felt little shame it was weak i knew
but this was my darkest hour

  and so i sat there forsaken and hope-
less until from behind me there came a
faint swishing as of a skirt then the
swishing changed to a rushing that ended
in a sudden thump beside my chair

  i have come jean said a voice and
i raised my head to look straight into the
eyes of toinette

   one searching glance i gave them before
i held out my arms yes they were the
eyes that i was looking for the eyes that i
had treasured

   toinette i asked at length why did
you not come to me when i was so ill

  but i was there jean she answered
i never left you a moment only when
you were yourself again did i go away

  so that rescuing hand had really been
there i reached out and took hold of jt

  and then i went on

   and then i waited said toinette it
was hard jean for i loved you truly as i
have always done it almost broke my
heart yet what could i do how else
would tante aurore allow me to act

  you remember that day when you
wished me to marry you all i asked was
one word of love yet it was not yours to
give true when you left me that day in
st pierre i thought that you loved me
but how could i know you had gone up
far up where you might easily wish to for-
get me and so if i came to you and you
did not want me--

  her cheeks flamed and now it was her
head that went down against my arm

  ah jean can you not see she
pleaded how could i do otherwise

  i did not wait to see the past made
no difference the future counted

  and now i questioned

  now we are sure tante aurore and i
she replied ossu came to us and told
us this morning he has been with you
and he knows

  and you will marry me

  i am here jean said toinette simply

   after this she fell silent nor did i find
any need for words i was content to lie
back in my chait and watch her wrapped
in the peace that is born of perfect joy
thus we were when at last le bossus sail
appeared winging its way into the vast
shadowy heart of the marsh

  then toinette spoke very softly like
one who utters a pleasant thought

  papa ton will be glad said she

  and i understood for the little man had
told me that he would put in that night at
bayou portage

  soon after this toinette declared that
she must leave it was late and achille
was very slow yes she would be back
next day bringing tante aurore the old
lady could wait no longer to see me and
besides there were certain proprieties to
be observed now that i was a great man
all eyes would be fixed upon me 

  so we rose and crossed the hilltop to the
opposite side where i stood for a moment
gazing eagerly out in the direction of the
fields

  then we went down to where toinette
had tied the surrey

  of our parting i will say nothing save
that it was observed only by achille and
he was too old to care about such things

  climbing up to the front seat toinette
unsheathed her switch for the vital stroke
that would send achille upon his way

  tomorrow jean she called and all at
once she lowered her arm

   it is jean for the last time she added
soberly now that you have come into
your own i must use your true name we
can not go on as before it would not be
fair to msieu the general

  i nodded in sudden conviction

  you are right toinette i agreed
tomorrow i will be john marsh

  so here ends the story of jean trouve

the end
the image of sesphra

by james branch cabell

 they of poictesme narrate that in
 the old days count manuel mar-
 ried and so fell into disfavor with
 king raymond they tell how it
 was raymonds daughter the princess
 alianora whom manuel had loved and
 loved no longer who prompted this dis-
 favor and thereby set dom manuel a
 problem which stays unsolved

   for manuel fled oversea with his wife
 dame niafer and they came in their dis-
 tress to sargyll where freydis the high
 sorceress received them hospitably queen
 freydis also they relate had loved dom
 manuel in a sped time wherein these two
 had practised queer necromancies now
 manuel had long ago forsaken these arts
 and he had forsaken freydis too but he
 remembered very pleasantly the fallen old
 ancient gods and the droll monsters and
 the instructive ghosts which he and queen
 freydis had been used to evoke and most
 pleasurably of all and with a glow of
 pride he remembered the image which he
 had made and to which they had given
 life because in doing that dom manuel
 felt he had really accomplished a master-
 piece of artistic con jury

   he hoped to find freydis the gray
 witch more philosophic than alianora the
 princess and in this hope he did not err

   for all passes in this world said
 freydis and the young manuel whom i
 loved in a summer that is gone is nowa-
 days as perished as that summers gay
 leaves what grizzled fighting man have
 you to do with that young manuel who
 had comeliness and youth and courage but
 no human pity and no constant love
 and why should i be harboring his light-
 hearted mischiefs against you

   ah no gray manuel you are quite
 certain no woman would do that and peo-
 ple say that you are shrewd so i bid
 you very welcome to sargyll where my
 will is the only law

   you at least have not changed dom




james branch cabell

manuel replied with utter truth for you
seem today as fair and young as you were
that first night upon morven when you
loaned life to the image i had made yet
that was a great while ago and i make
no more images

  your wife would be considering it a
waste of time queen freydis estimated

  no that is not quite the way it is
for niafer is the dearest and most dutiful
of women and she never crosses my wishes
in anything

   freydis smiled a little for she saw that
manuel believed he was speaking vera-
ciously

   well said freydis it is a queer thing
surely that in the month which is to come
your wife should be bearing your second
child under my roof and in my golden
bpd yet it is a queerer thing that your
first child whom no woman bore nor had
any say in shaping but whom you made
of clay to the will of your proud youth
and in your proud youths likeness should
be limping about the world somewhere in
the appearance of a strapping tall young
fellow and that you should know nothing
about his doings

  and what do vou know about him
freydis

  eh i suspicion many things gray
manuel by virtue of my dabblings in that
gray art which makes neither for good nor
evil

  yes said manuel practically but
what do you know

  i know that in sargyll where my will
is the only law you are welcome false
friend and very faithless lover she said
he could get no more out of her

  so manuel and niafer remained at
sargyll until niafer should be delivered
glittering messengers came from king
ferdinand and from king hoel and from
the duke-regent sigurd each proffering
this or that alliance now these princes
knew dom manuel was at outs with ray-
mond berenger but manuel considered
only niafer and let statecraft bide two
other ships that were laden with king ray-
monds men came also in an attempt to
capture manuel so freydis dispatched a
sending which caused these soldiers to run
about the decks howling like wolves and
to fling away their weapons and to fight
one against the other with hands and teeth
until all were slain

   there was never a more decorous hostess
 than queen freydis and nobody would
 have suspected that sorcery underlay the
 running of her household it was only
 through manuels happening to arise very
 early one morning that he chanced to see
 the night-porter turn into an orange-col-
 ored rat and creep into the wainscoting
 when the sun rose and manuel of course
 said nothing about this to niafer

   so the month passed prosperously and
 uneventfully while the servitors of queen
 freydis behaved in every respect as if
 they were human beings and at the
 months end niafer was duly delivered of
 a girl child it was freydis who tended
 niafer and freydis who brought the
 news to manuel and freydis who bade
 him rejoice now that all peril was over if
 freydis was to be trusted

  and we shall celebrate the happy
-event said freydis with a gay feast
this night in honor of your child

   that is well said manuel but i
suppose you will be wanting me to make
a speech and i was never a great hand
at such matters

   no for your place is with your wife
 no manuel you are not bidden to this
 feast for all that it is to do honor to your
 child no no gray manuel you must
 remain up-stairs this evening and through-
 out the night because this feast is for
 them that serve me and you do not serve
 me any longer and the ways of them
 that serve me are not your ways

   ah ah says manuel so there is
sorcery afoot yes freydis i have quite
given over thatsort of thing and while
not for a moment would i seem to be
criticizing anybody i hope before long to
see you settling down with some fine solid
fellow and forsaking these empty frivoli-
ties for the higher and real pleasures of
life

   and what are these delights gray
manuel

   the joy that is in the sight of your
 children playing happily about your
 hearth and developing into honorable men
 and gracious women and bringing their
 children i if turn to cluster about your tired
 old knees as the winter evenings draw in
 and in the cosy firelight you smile across
 the curly heads of these childrens children
 at the dear wrinkled white-haired face of
 your beloved and time-tested helpmate

and are satisfied all in all with your life
and know that by and large heaven has
been rather undeservedly kind to you
said manuel sighing

  yes freydis you may believe me that
such are the real joys of life and that
such pleasures are more profitably pur-
sued than are the idle gaieties of sorcery
and witchcraft which indeed at our age
if you will permit me to speak thus
frankly dear friend are hardly dignified

freydis shook her proud dark head
her smiling was grim

  decidedly i shall not ever understand
you doddering patriarch do you not
comprehend you are already discoursing
about a score or two of grandchildren on
the ground of having a half-hour-old
daughter whom you have not yet seen
nor is that childs future it may be yours
to settle well go to your wife for this is
niafers man who is talking and not mine
go up methuselah and behold the new
life which you have created and can not
control at all

  so manuel went to where niafer lay
pale and glad in the golden bed of freydis
and he duly looked at the contents of the
small heaving bundle at niafers side and
whether or no he scaled the traditional
peaks of emotion was no ones concern
save manuels he began in any event
to talk in the vein which he felt this high
occasion demanded

  but niafer who was never romantic
nowadays merely said that anyhow it
was a blessing it was all over and that she
hoped now they would soon be leaving
sargyll

  but freydis is so kind my dear said
manuel and so fond of you

  i never in my life declared niafer
knew anybody to go off so terribly in
her looks as that two-faced cat has done
as for being fond of me i trust her
exactly as far as i can see her

  yet niafer i have heard you declare

time and again-

  well and if you did manuel ofle has
to be civil	

  you women he observed-discreetly
as if it were not as plain as the nose
on her face-and i do not suppose that
even you manuel will be contending she
has a really good nose-that the woman
is simply itching to make a fool of you

again manuel  declare i have no pa-
tience with you when you keep arguing
about such unarguable facts

  manuel exercising augmented discre-
tion said nothing whatever

  and you may talk yourself black in
the face manuel but nevertheless i am
going to call the child melicent after my
own mother as soon as a priest can be
fetched from the mainland to christen her
no manuel it is all very well for your
dear friend to call herself a gray witch
but i do not notice any priests coming to
this house unless they are especially sent
for and i draw my own conclusions
well well let us not argue about it
my dear

  yes but who started all this arguing
and fault-finding i would like to know
why to be sure i did but i spoke
without thinking i was wrong i admit
it j-o do not excite yourself my darling
and as if i could help the childs not
being a boy

  but i never said-

  no but you keep thinking it and
sulking is the one thing i can not stand
no manuel no i do not complain but
i do think that after all i have been
through with- niafer whimpered
sleepily

  yes yes said manuel stroking her
soft crinkly hair

  and with that silky hell-cat watching
me all the time-and looking ten years
younger than i do now-and planning i

do not know what-

  yes to be sure said manuel sooth-
ingly you are quite right my dear

  so a silence fell and presently niafer
slept manuel sat watching her with a
perplexed fond smile for niafer was the
dearest and cleverest woman in the world
of course but it did not seem to manuel
that she was rising to properly exalted
zones of sentiment over the advent of the
small heaving bundle at niafers side

  nor did this niafer appear to be quite
the girl he had married a twelvemonth
back but even so this niafer was his
wife by his own choice and whatever
else she was or was not he could not now
control at all

some while after niafer was asleep
and when the night was fairly ad-
vanced manuel heard a whizzing and

romance

snorting in the air he went to the win-
dow and lifted the scarlet curtain figured
with ramping gold dragons and he looked
out to find a vast number of tiny bluish
lights skipping about confusedly and
agilely in the darkness like shining fleas
these approached the river-bank and
gathered there

  then the assembled lights began to
come toward the house manuel could
now see that these lights were carried by
dwarfs who had the eyes of owls and the
long beaks of cranes these dwarfs were
jumping and dancing about freydis like
an insane body-guard

  freydis walked among them very re-
markably attired upon her head shone
the uraeus crown surmounted by two
crested snakes and she carried a long rod
of cedar-wood topped with an apple
carved in bluestone and at her side came
the appearance of a tall young man

  so they all- approached the house and
the young man looked up fixedly at the
unlighted window as if he were looking at
manuel the young man smiled his
teeth gleamed in the blue glare then the
whole company entered the house and
manuel cum see no more but he could
hear smbll prancing hoof-beats down-
stairs and the clattering of plates and
much whinnying laughter manuel was
wondering what he must do for he had
perfectly recognized the strapping tall
young fellow

  presently manuel heard music it was
he knew the ravishing nis air which
charms the mind into sweet confusion and
oblivion and manuel did not attempt to
withstand its wooing he hastily un-
dressed said a staid prayer or two and
he slept dreamlessly

  in the morning dom manuel arose early
and left niafer still sleeping with the baby
manuel came down through the lower
hall where the table was as the revelers
had left it in the middle of the disor-
dered room stood a huge copper vessel
half-full of liquor and beside it was a
drinking-horn of gold

  manuel paused here and drank of the
sweet heather wine to hearten him then
he went out into the bright windy morn-
ing and to the river-bank where that
which he loved and dreaded awaited
manuel manuel knew that he went to
meet the image which he had made of

clay and to which through unholy arts
he had given life

  the thing came up out of the glisten-
ing ripples of brown water and the thing
embraced manuel and kissed him

  i am pagan the thing said in a sweet
mournful voice and so i could not come
to you until your love was given to the
unchristened for i was not ever chris-
tened and so my true name is not known
to anybody but in the far lands where
i am worshiped as a god i am called
sesphra of the dreariis

  that name has the ring of an ana-
gram said manuel

  it is if you insist an anagram the
thing replied

  i did not give you any such name
said manuel and then he said sesphra
how beautiful you are

  is that why you are trembling
manuel

  i tremble because the depths of my
being have been shaken i have lived for
a great quiet while through days made up
of small mishaps arfd little pleasures and
only half-earnest desires which moved
about upon the surface of my being like
minnows- in the shoals of a still lake

  but now that i have seen and heard
and touched yofi sesphra of the dreams
a passion moves in me that possesses all
of me and i am frightened

  it is the passion which informs those
who make images it is the master you
denied poor foolish manuel and the mas-
ter who will take no denial

  sesphra what is your will with me
it is my will that you go hence with
me on a long journey into the far lands
where i am worshiped as a god for i
love you my creator who gave life to me
and you love me more than aught else and
it is not right that we be parted

  i can not go on any journey just now
for i have my lands and castles to regain
and my wife and my new-born child to
protect

  sesphra began to smile adorably
what are these things to me-and you
or  any one that makes images

  then sesphra began to speak adorably
as he walked on the river-bank with one
arm about dom manuel always sesphra
limped as he walked a stiff and obdurate
wind was ruffling the broad brown shining
water and as they walked this wind buf-
the image of sesphra

qi

feted them and tore at their clothing
manuel clung to his hat with one hand
and with the other held to lame sesphra
of the dreams sesphra talked of matters
not to be recorded

  that is a handsome ring you have
there said sesphra by and by

  it is the ring my wife gave me when
we were married manuel replied

  then you must give it to me dear
manuel

  no no i can not part with it

  but it is beautiful and i want it
sesphra said

  so manuel gave him the rine

  now sesphra began again to talk of
matters not to be recorded and manuel
saw that manuels imperiled lands made
such a part of earth as one grain of sand
contributed to the long narrow beach they
were treading

  he saw his wife niafer as a plain-fea-
tured and dull woman not in any way
remarkable among the millions of such
women as were at that moment preparing
breakfast or fretting over other small
tasks he saw his new-born child as a
mewing lump of flesh and he saw
sesphra whom he had made so strong and
strange and beautiful and it was as in a
half-daze he heard that obdurate wind
commingled with the swejt voice of ses-
phra as sesphra talked of matters not to
be recorded

  now then let us go into the house
said sesphra presently and write droll
letters to king hoel and king ferdinand
and duke sigurd in reply to the fine
offers they have been making you

when they had come into the
disordered banquet-hall manue
cleared away the silver plates from one
corner of the table and he took pen and
ink and he wrote as sesphra dictated

  but these are very insulting replies
observed dom manuel and they will
make their recipients furious these
princes sesphra are my good frierjs and
they are powerful friends upon whose
favor i am dependent

  yes but how beautifully these replies
are worded see now dear manuel how
divertingly you have described king hoels
hideous nose in your letter to king hoel
and in your letter to the pious duke
sigurd that which you say about the ab-

surdity of religion here is a masterpiece
of paradox and very exquisite prose so
i must see to it that these replies are
sent to make people admire you every-
where but you and i will not bother
about these stupid princes any more nor
will you need any friends save me for we
will go to this and that remote stpange
place and our manner of living will be
such and such and we will do so- and so
and we will not ever be parted until you
die

  what will you do then dear sesphra

   i shall survive you as all gods outlive
their creators and i must depute the
building of your monument to men of
feeble minds which have been properly
impaired by futile studies and senility
that is the way in which all gods are
doomed to deal with their creators but
that need not trouble us as yet

  no manuel said i can not go with
you

  the hand of sesphra closed on the
hand of manuel caressingly

  manuel said

  i will go with you but what will
become of the woman and the child whom
i leave behind me unfriended

  that is true sesphra replied there
will be nobody to look out for them and
they will perish miserably that is not
important but perhaps upon the whole it
would be better for you to kill them be-
fore we depart from sargyll

 very well then said manuel i will
do that but you must come up into the
room with me for i cannot bear to lose
sight of you

  sesphra said-

  i shall not ever leave you now

  they went up-stairs together into the
room where manuels wife niafer lay
asleep manuel drew his dagger niafer
turned in her sleep so that she seemed to
offer her round small throat to the raised
knife manuel saw that on the other side
of the golden bed sat queen freydis mak-
ing a rich glow of color there and in her
lap was the naked new-bom child

  freydis rose now holding the child to
her breast and smiling a devil might
smile thus upon contriving some new tor-
ment for lost souls but manuel had not
known a fair womans face could be so
cruel

  then this evil joy passed from the face

romance
v-

james branch cabell

of freydis she dipped her fingers into
the bowl of water with which she had been
bathing the child and with her finger-
tips she made upon the childs forehead
the sign of a cross

  said freydis-

  melicent  baptize thee in the name
of the father and of the son and of the
holy ghost

  sesphra passed wildly toward the fire-
place crying-

  a penny a penny twopence a penny
and a half and a half-penny

   at his call the fire shot forth tall flames
and sesphra entered these flames as a
man goes between parted curtains and
instantly the fire collapsed and was as it
had been

  already the hands of freydis were
moving deftly in the sleep charm so that
niafer did not move freydis today was
resplendently robed in flame-colored silk
and about her dark hair was a circlet of
burnished copper

  manuel had dropped his dagger so that
the point of it pierced the floor and the
weapon stood erect and quivering but
manuel was shaken more horribly than
shook the dagger with horror and self-
loathing so he waited looking at his
dear wife niafer who slept untroubled
and at fiery-colored freydis who was
smiling rather queerly

  come now said freydis i must
tell you that sesphra is pagan and can
not thrive except among those whose love
is given to the unchristened thus he
could not come to sargyll until the arrival
of this little heathen whom i have just
made christian now we have only
christian terrors here and your fate again
is in my hands

  dom manuel groaned

  freydis he said you have rescued
me from unspeakable wickedness a mo-
ment more and i would have slain my
wife and child because of sesphras resist-
less magic

  said freydis still smiling a queer secret
smile

  indeed there is no telling into what
folly and misery sesphra would not have
led you for you fashioned his lgs un-
evenly and he has not ever pardoned you
his lameness

  the thing is a devil manuel groaned
again oh i have loosed among man-

kind a blighting misery which i can not
control at all

  the thing is you as you were once
gray manuel you had comeliness and
wit and youth and courage and these you
gave the image shaping it boldly to your
proud youths will and in your proud
youths likeness but human pity and
any constant love you did not then have
to give either to your fellows or to the
image or to me so you amused yourself
by making sesphra and me that which we
are today

  now again showed subtly evil thoughts
in the bright-colored shrewd face of
freydis and dom manuel of a sudden was
frightened it occurred to him for the
first time that he and his loved wife and
child were in this sorcerous place at the
mercy of the whims and the unwholesome
servitors of this not very friendly looking
witch-woman dom manuel thought of
that discomfortable night-porter and of
the madness that had smitten king ray-
monds men and of the clattering vicious
little hoofs of the shrill dwarfs and this
room seemed chilly

so manuel said with jovial laughter
you speak as if you had not grown
more adorable each year dear freydis
and as if i would not be vastly flattered
to think i had any hand in the improve-
ment yoii should not fish thus unblush-
ingly for compliments yet much of what
you assert is true for i would that i had
not ever meddled in this mischancy busi-
ness of creating things i can not manage
queen freydis moved in shimmering
splendor toward the fireplace and she
paused there considerately looking down
at the small contention of flames

  did you not thbugh again create
much misery when for your pleasure you
gave life to this girl child certainly you
must know that there will be in her life-
if life indeed be long spared to her said
freydis reflectively-far less of joy than
of sorrow for that is the way it is with
the life of everybody but all this like-
wise is out of your hands for in sesphra
and in the child and in me you have lightly
created that which you can not control
no it is i who control the outcome
why to be sure says manuel heart-
ily but in a cold sweat and i am sure
too that nobody is better qualified to


the  m age

handle it come now freydis just as
you say this is a serious situation and
something really ought to be done about
this situation come now dear friend in
what way can we take back the life we
gave this lovely fiend

  and would i be wanting to kill my
husband queen freydis asked and she
smiled wonderfully why but yes this
fair lame child of yours is my husband
today and i love him for sesphra is all
that you were when i loved you manuel
no manuel sesphra must live for a great
while long after you have been turned to
graveyard-dust and he will limp about
wherever pagans are to be found and he
will always win much love from the high-
hearted pagans because of his comeliness
and his unfading jaunty youth and
whether he will do any good anywhere is
doubtful but it is certain he will do harm
and it is equally certain that already he
weighs my happiness as carelessly as you
once weighed it

  well freydis but to be sure this puts
a new complexion upon matters and not
for worlds would i be coming between hus-
band and wife-

  queen freydis looked up from the
flames tovyarddom manuel very sadly
freydis shrugged flinging out her hands

  and at the last i can not do that
either so do you two dreary unimportant
well-mated people remain unhurt now that
i go to seek my husband and now i en-
deavor to win my pardon for not letting
him torment you eh i was tempted
gray manuel to let - my masterful fine
husband have his pleasure of you and of
this lean ugly woman and her brat too
as formerly you had your pleasure of me

  but women are so queerly fashioned
that at the last i can not consent to harm
this gray staid tedious fellow or any of
his chattels eor all passes in this world
save one thing only and though the young
manuel whom i loved in a summer that is
gone be nowadays as perished as that sum-
mers gay leaves it is certain a womans
folly does not ever perish

  indeed i did not merit that you should
care for me said manuel unhappily

  but internally he felt much more cheer-
ful for it appeared that freydis was not
going to do anything violent and irrepa-
rable and such as her better nature would
afterward regret

of sesphra	q

   queen freydis went to the window and
 lifted the scarlet curtain figured with
 ramping gold dragons

   look you now that ship which shows
 at the river-bend with lions and castles
 painted on her brown sails is king ferdi-
 nands ship which he has sent to fetch
 you from sargyll and all your troubles
 are over for ferdinand will give you new
 wealth and forts and meadowlands so
 i may now depart to look for sesphra
 and for my pardon if i can get it

   but whither do you go dear freydis

   what does that matter she answered
 looking long and queerly at him now
 that count manuel has no further need
 of me

   then freydis looked at niafer lying
 there in a charmed sleep

   i neither love nor entirely hate you
 ugly and lean and fretful niafer but as-
 suredly i do not envy you you are wel-
 come to your fidgeting gray husband my
 husband does not grow old and tender-
 hearted and subservient to me and he
 never will

   thereafter freydis bent down and she
 kissed the child she had christened

   some day you will be a woman meli-
 cent and then you will be loving some
 man or another man i could hope that
 you will then love the man who will make
 you happy but that sort of man has not
 yet been found

then freydis went away and her
castle went with her as a smoke
passes manuel was thus left sitting out-
of-doors in a reaped field alone with his
wife and child while ferdinands ship
came about

   niafer slept but now the child awoke
 to regard the world into which she had
 been summoned willy-nilly and the child
 began to whimper

   dom manuel patted this intimidating
 small creature gingerly with a strong
 comely hand from which his wedding ring
 was missing that would require expla-
 nation

   so manuel devoted this brief waiting in
 a reaped field to wondering just how much
 about the past he might judiciously tell his
 wife when she awoke to question him
 this problem they relate was set dom
 manuel in the old days and they say too
 that it remains unsolved

  by j

devil s house

storer clouston

it was on a dirty afternoon in late
october that dr anstruther turned out
of the mud and crowds and traffic of
new bond street into the well known
show-rooms of messrs marshlev  wal-
dron that was when marshlev  wal-
dron were in their old premises a short
way up from piccadilly and when motor-
omnibuses and cars were yet in the womb
of time and on a day like this your
trousers were splashed by the wheels of
hansoms and such-like prehistoric vehicles

  ill just have a look round by myself
thank you he said to the young man who
advanced and strolled on slowly through
the rooms

  the doctor was a tall gaunt large-boned
scotchman with a clipped gray mustache
and ragged eyebrows and a dry reserved
manner yet underneath the formidable
brows and the caustic speech a very occa-
sional twinkle in the eye and a surprizing
flavor of geniality in his rare smile hinted
at the reason why his friends though few
were devoted 

  it was that quality in fact of friendship
which had first jed him into marshlev 
waldrons a retired anglo-indian and a
confirmed bachelor he had settled in the
east coast hamlet of chipping-urby a few
months after his old friend colonel barlow
retired from the army and came to live at
urby hall

  the pair had always been intimate
cronies and by this time had grown to be
inseparable the more readily as the doctor
had no near relatives and the colonel only
one his nephew and reputed heir vincent
barlow a young barrister living in lon-
don while neighbors in that part of the
world were almost non-existent

  colonel barlow was a man of ample
means and a passionate collector especially
of rare china but with a strong distaste
for london and indeed for towns and town-
life of any kind dr anstruther on the
other hand liked to run up to town oc-


the devils house

casionally and on these occasions used to
look round the show-rooms and curiosity-
shops on his friends behalf he himself
was a collector in a modest way and an
excellent and sagacious judge

  such a valuable client was not apt to be
left long alone and he had hardly been
there five minutes before mr waldron him-
self came forward and greeted him affably
the mr waldron of those days being a
square-shouldered gentleman with a waxed
red mustache and a pale business-like eye

  we happen said he to have an ar-
ticle of vertu at present that the colonel
might quite fancy i have noticed his
taste is generally for the odd and unusual
in fact sir one might almost say for the
outre i think that is so doctor

  dr anstruther was a man of few words
he merely nodded and agreed that colonel
barlows taste did run that way

  its a quite remarkably outre article
said mr waldron quite unusually outre
in fact its a little too much so for most
people

  both by profession and instinct the doc-
tor was an observant man and it struck
him even at that moment that there was
something a little curious in mr waldrons
laugh he followed him through two or
three show-rooms and then as they ap-
proached a wide shelf on which a space
seemed to have been cleared round a single
object he was again struck this time by a
curious note in mr waldrons voice

  tut tut he exclaimed impatiently
what bit of nonsense is this now

  this single object was covered with a
cloth thrown loosely over it and as mr
waldron spoke he plucked it off and threw
it aside with an air of considerable irrita-
tion the doctor noticed

  dr anstruther himself was one of tlje
most imperturbable and least fanciful of
men yet hardly was the cloth off when he
was conscious of a curious wish that it
were on again the vase that stood re-
vealed was tall and of a foreign and ornate
design but beyond the fact that it had
generally speaking a kind of spiky ap-
pearance he was hardly conscious of its
details his eye was so filled by one figure
embossed on it in low relief and the im-
pression produced by this figure was so
singular for some moments he gazed at
it in silence and it was with a conscious

  effort that he turned away his eyes at last
and spoke

  i dont like it he said what do
they call the thing

  in our catalog we called it the lut-
zingen vase said mr waldron but
thats only where it comes from-lutzingen
in brartdenberg it has also a kind of
popular name so to speak which means i
believe the devils house 

  first part is suitable enough muttered
dr anstruther looking hard at the vase
under his eyebrows but why house
why it was called so i have no idea
but we are hoping to get some more infor-
mation about its story and if we do ill
be happy to send it on to colonel barlow
dr anstruther nodded absently his
thoughts seemed singularly engrossed

  the only figure on it the other con-
tinued is this curious gentleman who
seems to be a kind of high dignitary or
possibly a learned professor his robes
might do for either the vase is certainly
some centuries old and it is hard to say
exactly what he was meant for

  but it was not the robes of the squat
round-paunched figure that fascinated and
repelled the doctor it jyas the broad
gross smiling face with the remarkably
bulging eyes and yet even that seemed
scarcely ugly enough to give him the very
odd sensation that kept running down his
spine all the time he stood there and in-
creased disagreeably every time he looked
the creature straight in the eye

  it is an evil thing murmured dr
anstruther more to himself apparently
than aloud

  kind of odd feeling he gives one
agreed mr waldron who looked if possible
even less likely to be subject to odd sen-
sations than the doctor being in fact the
very incarnation of commercial shrewdness
and assurance one or two of our as-
sistants get quite scary especially as its
growing toward evening and before we light
up thats the meaning of this foolish-
ness

  as he spoke he indicated the cloth with
his foot

  nervoils chickens i call em he said
but i suppose some people are built that

way

he lowered his voice a little and added-
the worst of this bit of silliness is that
the thing might get stolen and something

t

else put in its place and youd never know
while this cloth was over it

  i should hardly think it was a thing a
thief would select observed dr an-
struther

  mr waldron tugged the end of his stiff
red mustache

  one would scarcely think so he
agreed but its a queer case i hardly
know what to think

  humph grunted dr anstruther
well to me it seems safe enough and
now i think ill look at something else
frowning formidably he looked the fig-
ure hard in the eye before he turned away
as if defying it to intimidate a veteran who
had looked heathen idols and sudden death
in the face for thirty years and then the
two passed into another show-room

  it doesnt appeal to you then sir
inquired mr waldron

  it does not said dr anstruther em-
phatically does it appeal to anybody
it isnt my own taste certainly in fact
speaking unprofessionally it hardly seems
to me what youd call a healthy taste
still as a matter of fact ive seen one or
two who seemed hardly able to tear them-
selves away from it theres a foreign

chap in particular-

  mr waldron broke off suddenly and
then touching the doctors arm said in a
lowered voice

  there he conies now the thing seems
to be a regular magnet for the fellow-
just look at him sir

  prom where they stood they could see
into the other show-room and there slowly
approaching the vase with his back half-
turned toward them appeared a well-
dressed young man in a black felt hat dr
anstruther studied him with pursed lips
and an intent professional look in his eye
more and more slowly the young man came
toward the vase stopping sometimes as if
he hesitated and almost decided to flee and
then drawn on by a force too strong for
him the simile of the snake and the bird
rose vividly to the doctors mind

  quite interesting he murmured ive
seen natives attracted like that by the
filthiest looking idols-women especially
temptation takes damned queer forms

hullo-

  he broke off and his eyes opened wide
the young man had come right in front
of the vase by this time and now with a

 jerky impulsive movement as if forced de
 spite his judgment he raised his hand and
 deferentially bared his head it was a
 curiously square head dr anstruther no-
 ticed with very close-cropped fair hair
 and it bent a little forward involuntarily
 toward the vase

   great scott exclaimed mr waldron
 the chap is taking off his hat to it

   his voice must have reached the young
 man for he turned with a violent start and
 for a moment showed a pale face with
 wide-open blue eyes staring in their direc-
 tion it was an open pleasant and simple
 face the doctor thought in the few seconds
 it was turned toward them and then the
 young man hastily put on his hat and hur-
 v ried out of their sight

   what a rum go commented mr wal-
 dron

   very murmured dr anstruther

 about the middle of the day a week
 later vincent barlow rang the bell
 of his sitting-room in ebury street and
 asked to see his landlady while waiting
 for her he stood looking out of the window
 as he had been looking before he rang a
 slight frown on his usually good-humored
 face and his hands impatiently jingling the
 coins in the pockets of his tweed trousers
 from his costume it seemed evident that he
 must be going out of town

    it was a slim dark-haired good-looking
 specimen of the briefless young barrister
 who turned from the window to greet his
 landlady when she entered

   this is a great nuisance he began
 im afraid i must ask you to give me a
 little lunch in my rooms before i go my
 uncle has asked me to take down rather a
 valuable bit of china which he has been
 buying marshley  waldron were to have
 sent it round here ready-packed first thing
 this morning but it hasnt come and i cant
 start without the thing

   im going round now to their place to
 see what has happened if by any chance
 it comes while i am away please see that
 the bearer understands that i havent
 started for urby hall yet but am coming
 back to my rooms and let him leave the
 thing here be very careful of it the
 lord knows how much my uncle has paid
 for it

    he snatched up his hat and was off and
 it was over an hour before he returned

the devils house



     that china vase is going to play the
   dickens with my week-end in the country
   he told his landlady half-humorously when
   he got back it seems that some other
   collector is after it and has persuaded
   marshley  waldron not to send it off till
   he has telegraphed an offer to my uncle
   so here ive got to wait till they get colonel
   barlows answer

     about four oclock a note came round by
   hand and vincent said with resignation
   well my uncle has refused the offer
   and the vase will be packed up and sent
   to meet me at liverpool street in time to
   catch the seven-forty-five thats the only
   train left now-and a rotten bad one at
   that

  as he followed his porter toward the
  train vincent barlow glanced over

	his shoulder at the illuminated clock and
   saw that it was twenty-five minutes to
   eight ahead of him down the whole
   drafty length of the lamplit platform he
   noticed only one fellow passenger a man
   in an overcoat and a black felt hat and
   when this man had turned into a carriage
   he and the porter were alone

     vincent had a quick imagination and he
   was accustomed to and being young en-
   joyed its tricks yet he was sharply and a
   little disagreeably surprized by the acute
   sense of loneliness which suddenly pos-
   sessed him now that liverpool street
   platform seemed to him the most depress-
   ingly desolate spot he had ever visited and
   though as a rule he was most particular in
   securing a carriage to himself it gave him
   a fresh touch of depression to see that not
   only was the third-class compartment he
   selected empty but all the other compart-
   ments in that coach likewise

     there seem to be very few people trav-
   eling by this train he remarked and then
   added be careful with that box porter
   it contains china

     china said the man i was wonder-
  ing what was in it it aint one of them cre-
  mation-urns is it sir

     for an instant vincent looked at the box
   askance and then he laughed and said-
   not as bad as that

     i was wondering said the porter with
   an odd look at the box

     he placed it on the seat and went away
   and for a minute or two vincent hung out
   of the window watching his retreating

rom

back and then with a conscious effort drew
the window up and settled himself in a
corner of the carriage

  it was a blustering october evening and
even under the station roof he could hear
the rushing and the sighing of invading
eddies from the wind without now and
then they made the window rattle and
promised a chilly journey over the east
coast flats

  behind his youthful ardor for the gaieties
of town vincent had a deep affection for
vacant country spaces and the seaboard
regions and as a rule a journey like this
out of london at dark into the dead of the
country gave him a pleasing sense of ad-
venture

  but tonight his spirits fell with every
minute he sat waiting for the train to start
and what surprized and disconcerted him
most was that he found himself wishing
that some fellow passenger would choose
this compartment to keep him company

  they started at last and he wrapped his
rug about his knees lighted his pipe and
tried to bury himself in a novel yet at
each station while they passed through the
environs of the town he caught himself
instinctively glancing at the window and
feeling each time a sense of disappointment
that no one entered and then when the
black country succeeded the strings of
lamps and the stopping-places grew few
he threw down his book and sprang to his
feet

  this time it was more than a sense of
loneliness that oppressed him a nasty
fancy had begun already to touch his
nerves and make them quiver and now it
became intolerable he was far from
timid his nerves were usually under ad-
mirable control and his high spirit scorned
this intruding fancy

  yet more and more loudly a voice
seemed to say to him-

  there is somebody else in this car-
riage

  he stood still for a moment wrestling
with the impulse and then nothing could
withhold him from dropping on to his knees
and looking first under one seat and then
under the other to make sure he even
took his stick down from the rack and
passed it along

  you fool he said to himself yet he
caught himself breathing more easily

  he sat down again and picked up his
q	j storer

book but again that unnerving fancy was
too strong for him he knew for certain
now it was only fancy for save under the
seat where could a fellow passenger hide
himself in a third-class railway-carriage

  and then he found his eyes instinctively
turning to that square wooden box which
the porter had so carefully placed on the
opposite seat and each glance he gave it
was more uncomfortable

  can the thing actually be an antique
cremation-urn he wondered for an in-
stant and then almost laughed aloud at the
idea of any urn containing a concealed fel-
low passenger

  but then again he wondered what had
made the porter ask that question and eye
the box so oddly had he felt something
of the same discomfort as he wheeled it on
his barrow if so could his own feeling
be mere fancy

  they stopped at a station and with a
vast sense of relief he-let down the window
and leaned out the clean night air
seemed to blow the disturbing fancy out of
his head and when they started he left
the window down and let the wind whistle
into the carriage all the way to gilswood
junction uncomfortable he still remained
yet the fresh drafts of air seemed to have
a tonic effect as if the fancy were morbid
and its cause unclean and the pure wind
from the sea disinfected the carriage

  the special feature of this evening train
to which vincent had objected was the
change which its passengers had to make at
gilswood and the tedious wait of an hour
before the connection for chipping-urby
could be caught that night with the
platforms in half-lighted darkness and the
wind tearing through them as through a
funnel and hardly a passenger to be seen
but himself the prospect was even less ex-
hilarating than usual

  as he went toward the refreshment-room
he was conscious of one or two figures pass-
ing out of the station farther up the plat-
form but at the moment those were all he
noticed and the refreshment-room itself
struck him vividly as emptiness incarnate
he had not ventured to let his uncles
precious vase out of his sight and so he
carried the box in with him placed it on a
chair and went to the counter

  the hour of the trains departure from
london had meant a chop at his rooms in-
stead of dinner at his club and he now

clouston

bought a plate of sandwiches and a cup of
cocoa and bore them to one of the tables by
the wall

  thank heaven this will serve to kill
some of the time he said to himself

  the place was a typical railway refresh-
ment-room large gaunt and ill-lighted on
this particular evening it was full of drafts
and flickering shadows within and besieged
by the wind without the waitress van-
ished after she had served him the light
was too bad for reading and as he sat there
with his sandwiches there began to creep
over vincent the same uncomfortable
haunting fancy that had depressed him in
the train

  on the chair beside him stood the
wooden box and before long he found him-
self with his elbow on the table and his
head on his hands staring at that square
case and wondering-insistently wondering

  the creak of a chair which disturbed him
seemed for an instant to be the twang of
his own startled nerves he turned his
head sharply to see a man sitting at that
same table a few feet from his elbow but
for that one creak as the stranger settled
himself in his chair he might have dropped
out of space

  i am afraid i have a little startled you
said the stranger politely

  startled though vincent unquestionably
was his eyes wore merely the impassive
steady english stare that simply says i
dont know who you are that barrier
which along with the north sea has kept
the outer world for centuries at arms
length

  but behind it he was observing from
his accent the man was a foreigner he no-
ticed and neither his clothes nor the close-
cropped fair hair beneath the black felt
hat had the british cut he was young
his face was open simple and serious and
his manner seemed to vincent indefinitely
suggestive of some secret excitement held
tight on leash

  on his part the stranger seemed to
fidget a little under the young englishmans
gaze

  i must apologize- he began

  not at all said vincent briefly

  for a few moments the stranger said
nothing more he had ordered no refresh-
ments and simply sat there with his elbows
on the table twisting his fingers a little
then he remarked-
the devils house

  there seems to be a curious feeling in
the air tonight

  again vincent was startled for there
was that in the young mans tone which
suggested they shared a confidence and he
was only too well aware how vivid this
curious feeling was to himself yet his
voice remained cool and his eyes guarded

  the young man was manifestly growing
nervous and his fingers were twining and
intertwining faster but a look of stolid
resolution had mounted to his eyes and
stayed there when he spoke again his
voice was deliberate with the deliberation
of strong control

  you have noticed it too he said
quietly and you have been wondering
yes it is strange and seems not easy to
account for

  a subtle hint in his eye more than his
voice that he was not so mystified himself
broke a little into vincents reserve

  can you account for it he found him-
self asking

  it is because you are taking away some-
thing that you should not take

  vincent was sitting at the side of the
oblong table and the stranger at the end
between them under vincents elbow was
the chair on which the box was resting
both glanced at it the stranger eagerly
and yet with a little shudder vincent
quickly and only for an instant the next
his eyes were on the strangers

  you seem to know my name he ob-
served dryly

  yes said the other talking quietly
now and with his restraint ebbing away as
he spoke i know all about you mr bar-
low it is the vase which you are taking to
your uncle it was i that telegraphed to
buy it back from him today-for he ought
not to have it but he has refused-re-
fused me any price

  my own name is helmolt i am not
myself rich but i am what you call of a
good family-von helmolt we are really
called and i have many friends and rela-
tions with influence and with mortcy but
i could not get them to realize till it was
too late and when they sent me at last the
money to buy the vase then it was too late
-just too late

  there was something so urgent and sin-
cere in the young mans flow of words that
vincents mouth relaxed

  bad luck he murmured

  von helmolts blue eyes began to light
up

  you sympathize he cried eagerly
ah i shall tell you more this vase is a
national relic it should never have gone
out of its own country and now it must
return to its country

  how asked vincent dryly

  the other grew even more insistently
earnest

  you and i shall try to think of a way
mr barlow he said lowering his voice
put yourself in the position of me imag-
ine an english relic something historic
something unique something of not so
great value in itself but of so much senti-
ment and value to you

  he glanced at the box as he spoke and
it was curious to note the mixture of gloat-
ing and yet of something like shrinking that
seemed to affect him for an instant

  then imagine it going away from eng-
land and how would you feel that is
how i feel

  though vincent had treated his profes-
sion lightly enough he had yet acquired
something of its scepticism and something
of its mask

  i see was his only remark

  if you see surely you can also feel a
little

  again vincent looked at him without
discernible expression

  well he asked

  well mr barlow i offer you three
hundred pounds for that vase

  unfortunately it isnt mine to sell
  four hundred pounds

  i tell you mr von helmolt it isnt
mine to sell

  five hundred pounds come now mr
barlow i know all about you you have
debts you need money you can give
your uncle whatever share of that live hun-
dred pounds you choose it covers nearly
ten times what he paid so there will be
plenty for you both or if you like the

box might simply get stolen-

  i think i hear my train said vincent
as he rose the other laid his hand be-
seechingly on his arm

  but surely my friend-

  vincent shook the hand off with a sharp
movement of his arm so sharp that it
struck against the chair between them and
the box upon it rattled and slid an inch or
two toward the edge

romance
j storer clouston

  the most extraordinary change came
over helmolt

  for gods sake he cried in an
agonized voice

  but on the instant vincent had seized
the rope round the box and the mans cry
died into a gasp of relief

  if you were to break that vase-

   again he broke off and looked at barlow
half-imploringly and half-menacingly

  if you break it or any one breaks it-
beware that which is in it- oh my
god but it must not get broken it must
not

  vincent looked at him with a kindlier
expression the man was mad he felt cer-
tain and he said to him soothingly

  thats all right i shall be careful
dont worry about it

  a distant rumble rose faintly above the
voices of the wind this time he knew it
actually was the train and with a nod and
a good evening he crossed the room to-
ward the platform

  glancing over his shoulder as he went
through the swinging door he saw helmolt
with his feet planted apart and his head a
little thrust forward staring it seemed
at the box he carried rather than at him-
self

   obviously mad he said to himself with
the confidence of youth

shortly after seven oclock dr an-
struther left his house to dine at the
hall he had to pass through the strag-
gling street of the little village on his way
where the greatest house was the small
ancient tavern obscurely styled the yel-
low mouse a quadruped surmised by the
learned to be descended from the maunch
dor in the arms of the early lords of
lirby

  in the light of a young moon its sign-
board hung black above the side-walk and
beyond a dark figure approached every
inhabitant of the village was well known
to the doctor by this time and this man
was not one of them he decided

  as they drew nearer there seemed to be
something vaguely familiar in the figure-
a young man in an overcoat and a dark felt
hat he seemed to be and then before they
had approached near enough to see more
distinctly the stranger turned into the
yellow mouse a curious suspicion shot
through the doctors mind

  it was barely half-past seven when he
passed through the lodge-gates and as he
still had plenty of time he strolled slowly
up the avenue two lines of tall beech-
trees nearly met over his head but their
leaves were fast thinning and the crescent
moon gave light enough to see glimpses of
the park on either hand and more dimly
the gray old house ahead

  he noticed that the air was unusually
still for the time of year in those regions
under the trees the evening indeed felt
even close

  if it were july one would expect thun-
der he thought

  so constantly did dr anstruther dine at
the hall and so unvarying was the routine
that it gave him a sharp shock of surprize
to find himself shown into the drawing-
room save on the very rare occasions
when there were a party of other guests it
had always been the library but tonight
a fire was burning here and what surprized
him afresh a paper and a couple of maga-
zines seemed to show that the colonel had
been sitting there during the afternoon

  some repairs must be going on in the
library he deduced

  colonel barlow entered a middle-sized
wiry-looking man with a weather-beaten
face and a quiet resolute eye a mouth
and chin firm to the point of obstinacy gave
a hint of the qualities that had given him
a fighting-reputation still remembered in
india and since then made him the most
pertinacious and indefatigable of collectors

  yet tranquil good humor was the chief
impression given by his face in repose and
still more so when he spoke and smiled

  youve moved into the drawing-room i
see said his friend and once again he was
surprized this time to find his remark
barely answered

  colonel barlow murmured something
vague about a change and then as usual
in that house dinner was announced with
military punctuality

  the colonel detested the trammels of
conventionality and made it a rule that his
servants should not stand about in the
dining-room overhearing the conversation
when he wanted to talk he liked to talk
freely and tonight he began abruptly-
vincent has been down here for the
week-end

  you told me he was coming

  his manners are not improving

romance
the devils house



  his manners

  the doctor stared at his host

  whats the matter with them

  pie has been spending too much
money said the colonel shortly and
when i told him what i thought of his ex-
travagance he was rude to me i cant
stand rudeness anstruther even from
vincent

  dr anstruther got a very sharp and a
very unpleasant shock of surprize this time
the mere fact of a quarrel between this
uncle and nephew usually the best of
friends and mutually attached was aston-
ishing his hosts petulant irritation was
knowing the man so well perhaps even
more unexpected

  what actually happened he asked
quietly

  colonel barlow hesitated he was a
reserved man and strongly averse from the
discussion of matters that touched him
nearly but gradually in the course of the
dinner he let fall the incidents of his
nephews visit and their unfortunate con-
versation

  and as they came out dr anstruther
wondered the more there seemed to have
been no reasonable grounds at all for any
serious difference either on the part of
uncle or nephew there was no story in
fact to tell unless something were being
held back

  yet there seemed to be the less reason to
suspect this since his hosts resentment
seemed gradually to fade away till by the
time the mahogany table was cleared after
the custom of the house and the port was
passed it had quite vanished and he was
his old quiet self again it was as if the
fumes of something disagreeable had dissi-
pated at last

  both men were abstemious drinkers and
heavy smokers and as a rule after a glass
of port they adjourned at once to the
library but tonight colonel barlow passed
the decanter thrice and then had the cigars
brought into the dining-room and all the
while dr anstruther was conscious that
he had not yet talked of all he meant to
at last he said a little abruptly-

  well anstruther i bought that vase
after all

  i thought you would-just to show your
independence of my opinion

  the doctor smiled a little as he spoke
but there was no smile in response

  it is- began the colonel and then 
hesitated its a devilish queer article
dr anstruther nodded

  i suspected that would attract you

  it doesnt attract me now-

  again colonel barlow broke off and then
added

  and yet in a way it does come and
have a look at it

  he jumped up suddenly and walked
quickly to the door like a man bracing
himself to do something he shrank from
the doctor noticed and it struck him for-
cibly that in all his long friendship with
barlow he had never seen him act quite
like this before

  entering the library at urby hall after
a pleasant dinner with his old friend and
with an evenings talk ahead always ap-
pealed to dr anstruther as one of the
happy moments of life the innumerable
multitude of books in their ordered rows
the wide blazing fire making the gilt letters
twinkle the shaded lamps the old leathern
easy-chairs and the aroma of excellent
cigars seemed to him to leave nothing else
for fancy to desire but tonight as he
crossed the threshold he realized on the
instant without a word said by either why
the colonel had been sitting in the drawing-
room why he had lingered over dinner
even why he had quarreled with his
nephew

  his eyes turned at once and instinctively
to the left again without a word to prompt
him and he saw the vase from his first
step into the room it stood on top of the
long bookcase that ran down that side of
the room a little above the level of his
head and from that height the squat gross
figure seemed to look down at him with a
smile at once intimately familiar and con-
temptuous

  and behind the smile there exuded an
atmosphere for which he could not find a
name which should sum up what he could
only call its beastliness

  colonel barlow closed the door and both
men went to the fire and then turned and
stood side by side with their backs to it
gazing at the vase

  well barlow frankly i dont call it
pretty said the doctor at last and as he
spoke he had an odd feeling that his crit-
icism was overheard as if he were half-
aware of some one behind the curtains or
under the table

romance
lol

j store r clouston

  its the most hideous thing i ever
bought

  too outre as mr waldron calls it even

for you

  yes said the colonel curtly and then
in a moment added with a touch of im-
patience most unusual in his voice well
if youve looked at it long enough lets sit

down

  they sat down with their backs to the
vase and each in turn tried to start the
conversation but it lapsed after a sentence
or two nearly five minutes of dead silence
followed and then though he had tried to
turn his thoughts in every other direction
dr anstruther found himself asking sud-
denly-

  did you have your talk with vincent in
his room

  the colonel nodded

  with that thing standing there

  yes said the colonel looking straight
into the fire

  the doctor said nothing more but he
was amazed to catch himself accepting a
bit of old china as a perfectly adequate ex-
planation of why two of the most good-
humored men of his acquaintance should
lose their tempers

  all at once colonel barlow threw his
cigar away and jumped up as if to get a
pipe from the mantelpiece he put out his
hand to the pipe-rack and then withdrew it
turned round and abruptly exclaimed

  im going to turn the damned thing
round i cant stand the look of that crea-
ture

  dr anstruther saw him go to the book-
shelf and put up his hand

  i can reach it better he suggested
jumping up too

  but it was one of the colonels few little
weaknesses that he disliked being thought
short of stature he did not even conde-
scend to rise on tiptoe but with an im-
patient movement tried to turn the vase
well above his head

  steady exclaimed the doctor

  the vase was swaying already and before
he could stride across the room the thing
had happened colonel barlow just man-
aged to break its fall or it would have
shivered into a hundred fragments as it
was it broke with a crash and lay in three
great pieces on the floor

  my god said the colonel and if the
doctor did not say it he thought it

  and it was not the mere accident that
affected them recalling his feeling after-
ward it seemed to dr anstruther-and
colonel barlow confessed to the same sen-
sation-as if the nasty atmosphere of that
room had become concentrated a hundred-
fold and then both men found themselves
breathing easily and even smiling at each
other over the pieces of china it was as
if a cloud had burst in thunder and a fresh
clean breeze sprung up

  thats a lesson to a young man to be
careful said the colonel with his usual
good-humored philosophy

  yes said the doctor dryly you cant
give that vase away as a wedding present

  i cant afford to do this sort of thing
often added the colonel though with
singularly little appearance of annoyance
for a man who had just broken an exceed-
ingly valuable curio

  they picked up the pieces and laid them
on top of the bookcase again and it struck
dr anstruther as a curious circumstance
that the squat figure seen in two halves
though ugly as ever seemed to have quite
lost his peculiar repulsiveness and when
he remarked on this his friend agreed with
him

  when they returned to the fire and
lighted their pipes and fell into their ac-
customed leather chairs their talk started
straightway on its familiar lines

  well shoot the north side on friday
began the colonel

  lining that high hedge for the first
drive as usual i suppose said the doc-
tor

when dr anstruther left a few
minutes after midnight the young
moon was then low in the sky and it was
appreciably darker in the avenue the
glimpses of the park were dimmer the
shadows through which he walked were
blacker and the air it seemed to him had
grown still closer the doctor in fact
soon threw off his overcoat and strode
down toward the lodge-gates with his white
shirt-front making a little light spot in the
gloom

  for some reason his thoughts went back
suddenly and vividly to his old days in a
certain frontier station when the tribes
were restless and sentries were being sniped
by daylight and suffered a still gorier fate
at night
the devils house

ioj

  a nice mark this shirt would make if
there were a pathan behind one of those
trees he thought and then to his an-
noyance he caught himself glancing sus-
piciously to the right and left in turn and
even quickening his stride a trifle

  i am growing senile he said to himself
and the next instant stopped dead with a
sudden contraction in the region of his
heart

  a dark figure was actually standing
within five paces of him a figure that first
seemed to loom up to a gigantic height and
then as he kept his eyes hard and frown-
ing upon it appeared to shrink to a lesser
stature than his own neither said a word
but he was conscious both of an intense
scrutiny and of a swift return of that same
repellent sensation he had felt in the li-
brary

  youll know me next time my man
he rapped out in his harshest voice-and
dr anstruthers voice could be very for-
midable who are you

  without a sound the figure slunk away
so swiftly that in another instant it had
utterly vanished into the shadows and yet
so silently that he did not even hear a foot-
fall he strode to where he judged it to
have stood and said to himself

  the fellow must have been standing on
the grass though i could have sworn he
was nearer who the devil can it have
been

  to give chase was so obviously futile
that after peering into the shadows for a
minute or two he resumed his walk down
the avenue more and more slowly he
paced till when he reached the lodge-
gates he stopped short for the space of
several minutes the stranger had ap-
parently been coming in the opposite direc-
tion and had certainly gone on toward the
hall and the more he reflected on this the
stronger grew the doctors reluctance to
leave his friends house unwatched and un-
warned

  to stand by the avenue and expose him-
self seemed unlike the conduct of a thief
still it had been a suspicious incident

  and then the spirit of the old hunter
decided the matter he put on his over-
coat again to hide his shirt-front pulled his
soft hat down over his face and retraced
his steps walking on the grass this time

  all the way up the avenue he saw not
a glimpse of a living thing and heard not

a sound though the night was so still that
the breaking of the slightest twig would
have been audible to his keen ears the
house as he drew near was a dark mass
unbroken by a glimmer of light and to all
appearances quiet as the grave

  skirting the gravel and all the while
divided between the fear of making himself
look foolish for his pains and an insistent
haunting sense that all was not well with
that house tonight he passed round the cor-
ner and entered a flower-garden that lay
beneath the library windows

  and there he stopped dead through a
chink in the curtain he could see a ray of
light escaping from one of those windows
knowing his friends habits to a nicety he
could count on the colonels smoking one
last small pipe after his own departure and
then going off to bed he had had time
enough by now to finish his pipe and be
off and the light then meant he was a little
later than usual

  keeping on the grass dr anstruther
stole along till he was almost opposite the
window and then he stopped again abrupt-
ly he could see now that the window was
a few inches down at the top and in the
dead silence of that still heavy night a
murmur of voices had reached him faint
but unmistakable

  dr anstruther ought to have felt re-
assured there were several possible solu-
tions of the problem of who the second
person could be-the colonels old soldier
butler for instance or the housekeeper
with a report of a servant ill and it was
manifest that there were no high words or
quarreling yet instead of reassurance
a dreadful nameless uneasiness seized upon
the doctor and kept him there with his
muscles instinctively braced like an animal
ready to spring

  faintly he heard the murmur of voices
so faintly at that distance and through the
curtains that it was impossible even to tell
which party was speaking yet the doctor
had the strangest fancy that he knew one
from the other by a curious feeling which
seemed to affect him when one spoke

  he was telling himself that this was the
idlest freak of imagination when he heard
low but quite plainly a laugh and at that
-imagination or no imagination-his scalp
tingled and for the instant he could not
have moved even if he would

  dead and utter silence followed for

minute after minute and then out went
the light the window became of the same
blackness as the creeper-covered wall and
dr anstruther turned away at last an
instinct as strong as that which had brought
him back seemed to tell him that the dan-
ger had passed from the house

  it struck him then that if a stranger-
that figure in the avenue perchance-had
entered the house and conversed with his
friend he might see him emerge from the
front door and so he hastened out of the
garden and round the corner of the house
but though he stood under the shadows for
several minutes he saw nothing

  then it occurred to him that if there had
been a visitor colonel barlow would most
probably have shown him out before ex-
tinguishing the library lights and so he
set off again

  i must never let barlow know ive been
spying on him he said to himself for he
knew that one of the few things his old
friend would find it hard to forgive was
anything like an attempt to surprize a con-
fidence he had not given spontaneously
himself and indeed no man could feel a
stronger sympathy for this sensitive reti-
cence than dr anstruther for his own
sentiments were precisely the same

  as he went down the drive he glanced
at his watch and noticed that it was then
quarter past eleven

some shooting-details to be arranged
made dr anstruthers excuse for
walking up to the hall next morning after
breakfast even from himself he tried to
conceal the truth that he was devoured
with something between apprehension and
curiosity to learn what had happened last
night for in his estimation curiosity was a
vulgar vice and apprehension a foolish
weakness

  but even if he did not see through him-
self as he hastened to urby hall at twice
his usual pace he realized it quickly enough
when he found his old friend smoking a
pipe in his library apparently as imperturb-
able as ever the intense relief came
almost as a shock

  yet he had only been in the library a
couple of minutes when it became clear to
his watchful eye that the colonels com-
posure was not unlike his own-a veterans
contempt for ruffled nerves they talked
of shooting briefly and both fell silent and

then abruptly colonel barlow said with a
forced laugh-

   i was half-thinking of coming to see
you professionally today anstruther
whats the matter

  something i ate or drank must have
upset me i suppose i dont often have
nightmares but i had a bad one last night
-soon after you left me in fact

  soon after i left repeated the doctor
in rather an odd voice

  i must have fallen asleep in my chair
i mean added the colonel correcting him-
self quickly i did fall asleep in my chair
and you had a dream-a nightmare-
bejore you went up-stairs and-er-before
you put the lights out and so on

  colonel barlow nodded

  extraordinary thing he said

  very agreed dr anstruther

  the colonel began pacing the room as he
smoked-with unusually quick steps his
friend noticed

  it was damnably vivid that infernal
vase seemed to have put it into my brain-
and its infernal name

  its name repeated the doctor

  colonel barlow stopped his walk sharply
and looked for an instant at his friend
he seemed to hesitate and then resumed
his pacing and said in a curiously con-
fused and indirect way for him

  connection of ideas i suppose if the
thing hadnt been absolutely impossible id
almost have- do you know it wasnt till
this morning that i thoroughly realized
it was only a dream

  he stopped at the turn of his walk and
for a moment was silent then in a
lowered voice he began-

  do you know anstruther i actually

dreamed-

  at that moment the butler entered
mrs summerton wishes to see you sir
he announced

  the colonel had been so carried away by
what was in his mind that for a moment
he looked at his butler in silenpe

  mrs summerton of the yellow mouse
sir added the man

  the colonel turned to his friend

  will you excuse me for a few minutes
anstruther

  beg pardon sir put in the butler but
i think mrs summerton would like to see
dr anstruther too he being a magistrate
likewise

r o m ance
the devils house

   oh said the colonel she wants to
see us as magistrates does she well
show her in

  the woman who entered was elderly
pale and very respectably dressed a
woman of a naturally quiet and superior
type one would judge at once and yet as
evidently a woman who had come through
some very disturbing and very recent ex-
perience and hardly had the door closed
behind her before she swayed threw out
an arm to find support and dropped into a
chair

a little later she told them this

 story

   he came by the morning train yester-
day-a german gentleman he was sir or
leastways a german helmolt was his
name he said and he wanted a room at the
yellow mouse as you know sir we dont
have many strangers in chipping-urby i
hadnt had not one of his class-thats to
say judging of his class to look at him from
his clothes and such like-not since my
husband died a year ago come january
and theres only myself and my niece lizzie
in the house now of course theres the
lad george too but he doesnt live on the
premises and no experience hes had of
waiting on gentlemen either

   so naturally sir i was a little doubtful
 at first if the gentleman would find satis-
 faction and i says to him quite plainly
 what was in my mind

    oh i wont give you no trouble mrs
 summerton says he and to be sure he
 was as good as his word indeed sir a
 nicer more modet-like gentleman i never
 had to do with than this mr helmolt-
 down to last night

   what was he like

   oh quite a young man sir with his
hair that close-cropped id have thought
hed been a convict if he hadnt have been
a foreigner very fair he was with blue
eyes and such a quiet civil well-brought-
up young man too he found my poor
husbands flute and played tunes on it and
played with the kitten too all the time he
was in the house i says to lizzie never
did i see a young man with more peaceable
tastes 

  did he wear a black felt hat and tight
 trousers and shoes that looked as if they
 vrp made of brown paper asked the

 doctor



  he did indeed sirl thats the very
things he did wear oh i quite took pity
on him when i saw how foreign he was
he asked such funny questions too one
would have called him inquisitive if hed
been english a lot about you sir he
asked- she was turning now to colonel
barlow- and whether you was very rich
and about your curiosities whether did
you keep them long or sell them again and
if id heard of your buying anything in
particular lately but i just answered so
he was none the wiser by the end

  and then in the afternoon off he goes
for a walk and was away that long id have
thought hed have walked miles but george
tells me that old thomas walker tells him
that all the distance he went was up to the
hall here and rambled round the park and
stood for nigh an hour on end behind the
big yew hedge staring at the house like as
if hed fallen into a trance

  by gad exclaimed the colonel i
saw the fellow myself from this very
window i spotted him as he was walking
away i remember wondering who he was
and thinking he was too respectable-looking
to be up to mischief

  behind the yew hedge said the doc-
tor half to himself hed be looking
toward the library then

  yes sir and so he would said mrs
summerton though he says nothing to me
or lizzie of where hed been when he
came back he had tea and after that he
seemed to get restless-like and at last out
he goes again it was beginning to get
dark by then and quite dark it was when
he came back saving only for the moon
and from what george can hear do you
know where hed been sir up to the hall
again and staring at the house

  again exclaimed colonel barlow
what the deuce was the attraction
when did he get back the second time
asked dr anstruther

  some time after seven oclock sir
ah said the doctor i thought that
was the man i saw him turning into the
yellow mouse what happened then
well sir he just went in to the little
parlor up-stairs id given him the little
parlor to himself for there was no one else
staying in the house and i thought hed
like to be private and comfortable-like and
there he was for the rest of the evening-
up till the time he came out

romance
j storhr

clouston

  mrs summartons tone fell and she
shivered a little

  you are sure he was in the parlor all
the time asked the doctor

  oh quite sure sir lizzie was in and
out once or twice bringing him his supper
and seeing to the fire besides wed have
heard him if hed gone out

   well sir it got to be late at last and
there was no customers in and george had
gone away and i had just been to lock the
front door and was thinking about going
to bed when something made me look over
my shoulder as i had almost got back to
the kitchen it was kind of shadowy be-
hind me for id put out the lamp in the
front passage but ill swear to my dying-
day sir i saw a black figure of a man
crossing the fronpassage very quick as if
hed come through the front door and dis-
appearing up the stairs and id just
locked the front door myself-and never a
sound of his footsteps did i hear how i
got back into the kitchen without falling
down in a faint i dont rightly know sir

  what oclock was this asked the doc-
tor with a curious intensity in his voice

  i happened to notice sir it was just
quarter-past eleven when i left the
kitchen

  dr anstruther nodded in silence and
as if to himself and the colonel asked-

  did you see his face

  no i did not sir and thankful i was
too for what i did see made me more of a
tremble than ever ive been before in my
life

  but was it actually anybody did you
see him again

  i never saw or heard but one man in
the house sir she said in a low voice
and whether there actually was two or
which it was i saw that i dont know but
ill tell you the very truth sir just as it
happened

   when i got into the kitchen lizzie was
for laughing at my notions and saying it
was either the shadows or perhaps the
strange gentleman up-stairs come down for
a moment and then gone up again so at
last i let myself be persuaded i was foolish
and yet i wanted to make sure so i took a
lamp in my hand and went into the pas-
sage and up the stairs to see if i could hear
if there was voices or anything in the little
parlor

  was there asked the colonel

  no sir there was just dead silence
i can swear to that but just as i was near
the top of the stairs his door opened a
chink and i saw him plainly peering out
oh sir the difference in his eyes

  she paused for an instant and shivered
afresh

  it was not like the same young man at
all and then he spoke-just one word
but it was enough  washolding the lamp
before me and it was quite dark behind me
and so his eyes would be dazzled and he
wouldnt be able to see rightly who it was
thats how he came to make the mistake

  lizzie he says and if you heard a
girl being addressed at night in a voice like
that sir youd know the man didnt mean
much good

  i gave a little scream-i couldnt help
myself-and so he knew then who it was
he said just one word that time too it
was in his own language but i knew it was
a curse-word and then he banged the door
again and i was just able to get down
without dropping that lamp and no more
sir

  and then asked the colonel quietly

   then sir i put off going up those stairs
again to my bedroom just as long as i
could and all the while i was wondering
if i could say anything to lizzie for shes
a kind of innocent high-spirited girl and i
feared shed just laugh at my fancies

  for hed only just said her name mind
you sir and could i explain to her how
hed said it then says she im that
sleepy auntie im going off to my bed
and so we both went up then and id been
in my room about ten minutes when sud-
denly i heard the girl scream

  yes said the colonel still quietly

  i was at my door just in time to open
it to her and it was all the two of us could
do to get it shut and locked in his face
you can guess yourself sir what hed been
after but youll hardly guess what he did
when she struggled with him he just hit
her on the eye with his fist and it was all
black and swelled up by the time shed got
to me

  my god murmured the colonel very
quietly indeed this time

  the gurkhas who had fought under him
could have told you instantly what that
quiet meant

  oh how he swore sir and shook the
door and then suddenly it grew even

----jgi- romance - ft ssilsbel-
the devils house



worse he was quite still for minutes and
minutes on end-it seemed hours to me
sir-and we could hear him breathing and
feeling about the door with his fingers

  and then we thought we heard him
going down-stairs but we werent sure and
there was nothing we could do except put
the chest of drawers against the door and
just wait my rooms at the back of the
house sir and theres no one who could
have heard us if wed cried foriielp

  then at last when it had been quite
quiet for a long time we heard the cat cry
out once down below and then gentle
sounds of his moving about and other queer
sounds that we couldnt understand till
morning and that was the way the night
passed with us sir

  and in the morning

  when we knew that neighbors would
be about at last we ventured out he was
gone then but hed done what was almost
the worst thing of all he had heated the
poker and burned some writing on my nice
mahogany table its the one thing in my
house im proud of sir and id told him
it was too and on the table was a bucket
of water and lizzies kitten-the one hed
been playing with-was lying drowned at
the bottom of it

  do you know where hes got to the
colonel rapped out like a rifle-shot

  he had slipped out of the house without
our hearing him and caught the early train
to london

  damn murmured the colonel with the
profoundest disappointment

  and not a penny has he paid me-and
my table is ruined

  what did he write on it asked dr
anstruther

  mrs summerton took a sheet of note-
paper from her pocket

  i wrote it down sir for i knew i
couldnt carry it in my head

  on the paper they read

  my compliments and farewell to you and bar-
low and dirty little england they can keep their
vase now and you can keep your slut

  and such a quiet peaceable young man
he seemed cried the poor woman do
you think sir was he taken suddenly
mad 

  the two men were looking at each other

  the vase-that was what he was after 
exclaimed the colonel

  the doctor nodded

  i knew that he murmured

  this happened after it was broken 
  again the doctor nodded

  colonel barlow turned to mrs summer-
ton and led her to the door talking gently

  ill make the damage good he said as
she went out and if i can catch the
fellow-

he came back to his friend and both
were silent for a space then the
colonel said in a very serious voice

  what i dreamed last night was that
satan himself walked into my library and
tried to tempt me it was a damned queer
form of temptation too-not the usual
thing one reads of i was to be the swept
and garnished house and he was to inhabit
me i dreamed i told him id get my dog-
whip to him and then i dreamed he
laughed and went away

  dr anstruther seemed for an instant
about to say something and then held his
peace

   i didnt tell you last night anstruther
continued the colonel that id heard from
marshley  waldron and theyd told me
the legend about the vase the gentleman
in question is said to have been imprisoned
in it-shut up in that beastly figure-some
hundreds of years ago and if the vase was
broken hed get out i didnt tell you be-
cause-er-well the whole thing was beast-
ly and had got a bit on my nerves when
i had the dream i thought of course that
that yarn had pul it into my brain

  again dr anstruther made no answer
and in a moment the colonel said-

  if one believed in such things one
would say he had found his swept and
garnished house

  this time dr anstruther nodded em-
phatically

olonel barlow saw the local
police at once and they communicated
with london but by the time mr helmolls
address had been discovered he had de-
parted for his native land

  where they will regret the breaking of
that vase some day observed dr ans-
truther grimly or were we all off our
heads-or simply dreaming

  time wih show said colonel barlow

the heart of conchita

by edgar young

 little conchita morales was by far
 the homeliest girl in guayaquil she
 had a figure like a horse shoe a
 pinched up little face devoid of even
 rudimentary prettiness later one noticed
 that she had large brown eyes regular
 white teeth and extremely small feet she
 was tongue-tied of speech but she could
 dance like a dream could thrum real music
 from a guitar and she could sing

   charles barnes and eugene rodin had
 been invited to the baile at the alcaldes
 house by the alcaldes son francisco
 whom they had met on the boat from bal-
 boa francisco pancho or frank mar-
 tinez had just finished an education at
 columbia university and was proud to
 show off both his american friends and his
 knowledge of english and was pleased to
 show the americans his own people at their
 best the average american may travel
 all over central and south america and
 never see the inside of a better class home

   after the general hand-shaking and
 meeting the guests was over and the two
 americans had whirled through a few
 drnces barnes noticed that the little mo-
 rales girl certainly did not lack for partners
 and between dances men flocked around
 her he made mention of this to rodin
 they both engaged waltzes with her and
 when these were over agreed that she
 could certainly dance but otherwise there
 didnt seem to be anything to her how-
 ever the commotion the men raised over
 her caused rodin to call frank martinez
 aside and ask him concerning her mar-
 tinez chuckled

   oh conchita not very pretty is she
 certainly not a brilliant conversationalist
 shes a darling though shes what we call
 simpdtica fascinating as you say in the
 states i used to be crazy over her i
 begged her to marry me and when she re-
 fused i came near ending my life by sui-
 cide shes said no senor to all of us
 i think ive lived it down up there in your


the heart of conchita

hustle-bustle states but ill know better
when this ball is over

  when he had walked away both amer-
icans grinned knowingly

  love goes where its sent said eugene
rodin the poor mutt lost his head about
her and thought everybody wanted her
barnes looked across at the girl stand-
ing in the center of a group of men who
plainly showed their admiration for her

  yes and she seems to be proving his
words he stated but they can all have
her that big dreamy eyed lola seems
about the one for me either she or that
little spicy luz

  and the men went ahead enjoying them-
selves it makes any american put his
best foot foremost to equal the manners
and breeding of the better class latin
american in spanish english and
french the conversation often touched on
topics not heard outside the most select
drawing rooms in the united states wit
jest banter and sparkling bits of talk the
jrou-jrou of silken skirts gleaming white
and olive shoulders twirled mustaches lan-
guid eyes that now and then spoke boldly
sighs jealousy and all the rest of it to
the wailing of the fiddles and the shrill
piping of the flutes

  and when the ball was over the men
one and all stampeded over to conchita
and asked her to sing she only consented
after much coaxing in which the two
americans joined some one brought a
mandolin and she stepped quickly to the
center of the hall

  she began with a comic love song some-
thing about a young fellow who always
carried a loaf of bread and munched on it
when he passed and repassed his sweet-
hearts door played bear so that her
mother would not think he kept himself
alive by seeing her solo por verte me man-
tengo-o-o sang a couple of ranchitas then
she sang her favorite it was vida mia
it is a song that stirs the soul it is an
old one written by some wandering trouba-
dour back in spain it is a song of wan-
dering and love unrequited soft sibilant
lisping now and then rising to the high
notes like the lute of a lonely shepherd her
vibrant contralto spread the veil of queen
mab over the sordid earth men and
women were gods and goddesses she a fairy
queen

  outside the trade-wind whispered among

jil rom

the palms the perfume of moon flowers
was wafted through the room just be-
neath the window the guayas gurgled
against the stone wall as it rose with the
incoming tide she had paused and trotted
from the room behind her aunt juana be-
fore the audience came back to earth
frank martinez strode rapidly in her wake
then the bustle of leave-taking began

  on the way back to the hotel barnes
said to rodin-

  i guess pancho hasnt lived it down
yet

  hed be a poor clod if he had shes
a bear no wonder they rave about her
she was as far ahead of any other girl
there as i am of a crazy monkey mur-
mured rodin

  yes on this earth we are blind people
wandering through a haze and it is only
by soul contact that we know each other
there is a wonderful spirit bound up in
that clay and it expresses itself in song
both men paused and each looked keen-
ly at the other then they laughed and
walked rapidly toward the hotel

ii

guayaquil is certanly not a health-
resort people die there of yellow
fever bubonic and other less deadly dis-
eases there is not a stone or brick build-
ing in the city and even the cathedral is
built of split bamboo due to the fre-
quency and violence of the earthquakes
it is sixty miles up the guayas river from
the coast and the city is below the level
of the river at high tide the natives of
guayaquil are mostly immunes but now
and then a plague breaks out that slays a
quarter of the population in a few months
this is how it has earned its name of the
graveyard of south america few amer-
icans and white europeans remain longer
than to catch the next boat away those
who have been there and got away alive
boast of it ever afterward

  during the summer of  twenty
thousand people died of yellow jack and
bubonic and many more were slain in the
swamps just outside the city as they fought
hand to hand battles with machetes for
a revolution was in progress a series of
earthquakes came that caused the earth to
roll in waves like a stormy sea wooden
shacks were toppled over and people lay

flat on their faces in the muddy streets and
prayed for mercy the rains came and
washed thousands of bodies down the little
creeks and into the guayas numerous
corpses floated up and down with the tide
in front of guayaquil

  eugene rodin and charles barnes re-
mained through it all the last thing they
wanted to do was to leave no matter
what the day brought the cool of the eve-
ning saw them either in the patio of the
morales home or at the home of some
friend where she had gone some of con-
chitas suitors had died some had been
slain in the revolution on one side or the
other and some had lost heart from the
cruel competition waged by the two amer-
icans and by frank martinez one or
the other or all three of them was with
her constantly she sat hunched up in a
chair and held tongue-tied discourse with
them and they bore with it later she
sang then there was no more sickness
on the earth no earthquakes no revolu-
tions nothing but love and kindness and
conchita with a heart of gold

  one night conchita noticed a look pass
between rodin and barnes that was any-
thing but friendly she had been at great
pains to treat them both equally well and
had often neglected pancho to do so that
night she cried when the three men had
gone home the friendship of the two had
appealed to her as something fine and
noble it had been so unselfish she had
been having a grand time and now it ap-
peared that trouble was brewing her
womans intuition had sensed it even be-
fore the men knew of its existence she
vowed to see less of them in the future
and she did

  but the less she saw of them the more
jealous they became of each other and the
more enamored of her it had been a hard
summer and the nerves of the two men
were raw also the tropical sun strikes a
certain hysteria into a strangers brain
the normal loves and hates and desires are
magnified a hundred-fold cold-blooded
scientists make mention of ultra-violet rays
of the sun herb spencer would have
called attention to the nearness of the mo-
tive force that drives life on this planet
they all forget that plant life absorbs car-
bon dioxide from the air and gives off pure
oxygen people are living at white heat in

the tropics because they are drunk with a
superabundance of oxygen

  an ill-timed jest caused one of the
americans to move from the hotel and take
up residence at a native petition after
this they passed each other on the street
without speaking and then separated
from each other they began to hate as
bitterly as close friends do when they fall
out by using pancho as a mutual friend
they timed their visits so that they did not
meet at the morales home pancho had
decidedly the better of it for he came and
went when he chose and he sympathized
with all three in turn

  each of the americans tried to pick
something bad from him that the other had
let slip but he only had good words that
each had said about the other this
caused both barnes and rodin inwardly to
rage for it appeared to each that the other
was trying to appear more gallant each
hoped that the other would forget and say
spiteful things and by this appear to be
less of a man in conchitas eyes hate fed
on hate and jealousy fed on jealousy until
the men were at daggers drawn with only
a word needed to start real trouble

ill

a ball had been going on at the
alcaldes house conchita had re-
fused to dance with either american but
had danced frequently with pancho mar-
tinez at the finish she had been especially
cruel and had refused to sing and trotted
away with her aunt juana with a curt nod
for both barnes and rodin each of them
knew in his heart that the other had been
the cause of her peculiar actions and was
raging pancho had gone in her wake pos-
sibly to sing a serenade under her balcony

  in filing out of the door some one
tramped on barnes foot rodin was fully
half a yard behind him when it happened
barnes face went black he stopped and
glared at rodin

  i would thank you sir to look where
youre walking you hurt my foot

  i knew you wore a number nine but
didnt think you had an uncle joe heel
that stuck back like a pot leg

  keep to hell off of them

  back out next time theyll take up
less room

hi

   the men said no more but stalked down
 the street with their heads in the air

   guayaquil was an inferno the guayas
 was a slimy river filled with snakes and
 reptiles and covered with floating islands
 of putrid vegetation the death-dealing
 mosquitoes flew in clouds the wind flopped
 drearily through the palms and banana
 bushes bloated-faced men dying with the
 plague crawled belly-wise through the
 streets toward the river to gulp the murky
 fluid and die where they lay a breeze came
 across the swamp from the matadero
 heavy with the stench of rotten flesh in
 the houses women were wailing their dead
 with high-pitched sobs

   rodin noted that the peruvian line
 steamer santa ysobel lay in the middle of
 the stream loading cattle from some light-
 ers at her side half-naked stevedores in
 the lighter fastened the cable around the
 horns of the steers and they went up over
 the side kicking and snorting a thought
 came to him and he hailed barnes the
 other paused until rodin came up rodins
 eyes were bloodshot and he shook a
 clenched fist under barnes nose

   this town is getting too damned small
 for both of us im thinking it would be
 safer for you to take that peruvian and
 beat it for callao

   barnes took off his coat and folded it
 carefully

   gene rodin ive always suspected you
of being yellow i hate to have to thrash
you i feel sorry for you but im going
 to do it

   yellow am i well see whos yellow
 any big boob can fight like a gringo and
 get all beat up whether he wins or not i
 think you are afraid of cold steel ive
 been in these countries so long that i be-
 lieve in knife-fighting you pack one with
 yow thats just like this one i have what
 are you going to do with it use it to cut
 cigaret shucks with

    rodin pulled off his coat and rolled his
 sleeves up above the elbows he took a
 sheath-knife from his belt and ran his
 thumb along the edge it glittered cruelly
 in the lamplight the two men squared
 off the street ran along the river front
 and was deserted except by people too sick
 to notice what was happening they
 sprang and each parried for an opening
 no words were spoken as the men circled
 around like fighting cocks trying for a

thrust barnes slashed for rodins throat
and the point missed by a hair rodins
knife grazed barnes stomach as barnes
sprang back

  there was a stifled scream and quick
running steps on the board-walk con-
chita ran between them she begged them
hysterically to be friends her excited
tongue-tied words appeared ludicrous
under the circumstances pancho had ar-
rived from somewhere and he put in a
word now and then from a few paces away

  you no fight para me you be good
friends saben buenos amigos for you-
self and both good friend myself no es
tncjor is it not better i like as good
friend both but as lover no no no
asi me like panchito i make matrimony
with him pretty soon

  both americans eyed her harshly they
grasped her by either shoulder and spoke
fierce words to her

  she smiled up into their angry faces
and reiterated what she had said before
the twisted little smile and the quivering
lips made each mans grip on her shoulders
relax until their hands lay like a gentle
caress then she put both their hands
from her the men stood facing each
other like bashful school-boys she looked
quickly from one to the other as if un-
decided

  be good friends youself she coached

  they shook hands and smiled at each
other conchita drew away and came to
the side of pancho who took her arm and
spoke gentle words into her ear she ap-
peared more stoop-shouldered than ever
her face more pinched her eyes more
brooding the americans bustled over and
shook hands with pancho martinez with
a heartiness they did not feel then tell-
ing the couple hasta luego an revoir
they strolled down the wharf adios
good-by would have been more appro-
priate it was really the farewell

  looking out upon the murky guayas
they noted that the last lighter was poled
into place and the men shouting to each
other as they hurried the cattle aboard

  i wonder- began rodin

  lets try

  they turned and ran across the wharf
and up into the city each man to his stop-
ping place in a few moments they came
running back carrying suit-cases a bolero
who dozed in his flimsy boat aroused to the
  

palazzo- co nt a r i n i

prod of a nervous foot and stared at the
silver piece thrust before his eyes then
he headed his boat for the ship and began
plying his paddle

  conchita still stood on the wharf arm in
arm with frank martinez when the boat
shot out into the river she heard the two
americans laughing and joking good-
naturedly in the dim boat lamplight at
the headof the gangplank she saw them go
aboard the ship she saw the plank
hoisted heard the anchor chain rattle in
and the thumping of the anchor on the
deck heard the engines throb deeply and
saw the ship move slowly down the guayas
on its way to the sea she sighed deeply
pancho pressed her arm and murmured
gently

  it was a surprize when you said you
would make matrimony with me but a
glad surprize my heart overflows with
love for you conchita chiquilla i will
speak with the priest tomorrow no eh

  tonto foolish one i made jest with
them its not you that i love you are
my good good friend it was one of those
i had not the heart to pick

  she began to cry gently big hearted
pancho tried to console her but she turned
from him and ran away toward home leav-
ing him staring after her dazedly

  through the big bamboo doonvay
arched with flowering vines she hastened
and up the light stairway to her room
throwing open the lattice window she
gazed down the river at the disappearing
lights of the ss ysabel as they were
swallowed up in the darkness she took from
her dress a few small trinkets the men had
given her something seemed to be clutch-
ing her throat as she kissed these little re-
membrances

  adios good friends you will meet
many others and many pretty ones but
none will consider your happiness more
than little conchita

  then as if no other way in the world
would express how she felt she began sing-
ing vida mia her favorite the song of
wandering and love unrequited and had
she known it perhaps she would have felt
better or perhaps worse for two americans
stood at the stern rail of the ss ysabel
peering back into the darkness with heavy
hearts

 the terrible island

 by beatrice grimshaw
 a four-part story
 part iii

      the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

sapphira gregg was one of the bravest
women and best traders of new guinea that
night as i sat on the porch of her house on
croker island with rocky jim my west aus-
tralian friend and percival flower the new gov-
ernment surveyor she said-

  i can tell you if any one could find ku-kus
island his fortune would be made

  i am a crippled bug-hunter acquainted wijh
the talk of the islands but flower being a
stsanger had then to hear about old chief ku-ku
of the trobriand islands whose biggest treasure-
house had never been located though all new
guinea knew that it held the immense hoards of
shell money that made him a papuan millionaire

  but so associated was the very mention of
ku-ku with the dangers and tortures to which
he had subjected his men on trips to this mys-
terious treasure island that no information could
be wrung from the natives as to its location
those who returned from it alive came back sight-
less chief ku-ku had finally been stabbed in
the back by one of his blinded victims

  sapphiras scream cut horribly into the silence
that followed our talk of ku-ku

  if im not mad she said a ghost has just
walked up out of the sea and is coming to the
house

  thats not a ghost-its a girl said flower

  before we could grasp it the ghost-woman in
evening dress dripping with sca-water had fainted
in sapphiras arms

  days later though she still could tell us nothing
of her past her attention was caught by the word
shipwreck quite mechanically she said

  theyre gone they went in the boats ku-
ku island finster island caradoc reefs disap-
pointment island ku-ku island

  amazing to have the direction of this spot as
secret as it was covetctd given to us  and to
have it come from lady mary as we began to call
the beautiful sea-woman be it right or wrong
but increased the mystery of her identity

  one day the tagula the schooner of the good
swede captain carl landed weeks before she
was due this brought matters to a head

  what can have brought her i asked

  whatever it is i know what will take her
away and where to- theres our chance for th-i
island jim called back on the way to meet the
captain

in no time at all jim had poured out the story
of the sea-woman and her message about ku-
ku with very little more talk we chartered the
tagula for the big search

  captain carl had landed to see if any of us
could identify a dead man he had picked up at
sea the sight of him seemed to stimulate lady
marys deadened memory but to flowers eager
questions she gave only fragmentary answers say-
ing cedric a name evidently connected with her
former life she could not have done more dam-
age than she did by using this one word cedric
i knew instantly from the way that flower acted
that he had let himself fall deeply in love with
her since i knew that my own love must count
for little i was cruelly glad of his rebuff though
she could not explain why seeing the dead man
had made her struggle to remember yet with a

quiet air of ownership she placed the ring that had
been takn from him on her finger as if it had
once belonged there

  when the work of provisioning carls boat was
completed and we were a few hours under way
we discovered that lady mary was a seaman
while she was earning carls praises at the wheel
the bosun sighted an english man-of-war

  a chance to trace lady marys friends i cap-
tain carl promptly signaled but the dapper
lieutenant who came over reported no recent
wreck in new guinea waters he was suddenly
signaled back to his ship before any arrange-
ments for helping lady mary could be com-
pleted

  trouble brewing in german new guinea was
carls explanation of the wireless that had sum-
moned the man-of-war away in such haste lady
mary resumed the wheel again at carls invitation

days later it was the sea lady who first
sighted the lusancays carl would not
leave his ship but insisted on a quantity of
supplies being put ashore with us a quick
storm blew up as we were forcing our way
through the thick brush of the island and drove
us into one of the many caves for shelter

  jim had just dashed out into the rain to look
for the ship when a dark barefoot man dressed
in rough dungaree walked uncertainly into our
midst at sapphiras ill-timed gasp the stranger
swung round snatched a revolver out of his
bell and fired after five more shots one of
which landed in my arm flower downed him
with a furious blow and rushed us safely out
of the cave

  as i looked back four men with pistols ap-
peared at the mouth of the cave the next shot
went wild i slipped along the track to warn

grimshaw

jim who greeted us with the news that the
tagula had disappeared he figured that the
squall had driven her onto the reef and sunk her

  why didnt the beggars welcome us said
flower later

  they expect their cutter any day the sea
lady broke in and then told us the facts which
the sight of these natives had brought back to
her she related how these men had taken her
into their cutter off a big fast ship with guns
they had spoken greek and a little pigeon-
english they had captured and maltreated a
poor native in a canoe loaded with red shell
and shell money until he told where he had
found his treasure after that they had killed
him and thrown him overboard then they
had fought to win her terrified and desperate
she had managed to jump into the sea undis-
covered all she remembered was that something
had hit her on the head before she had made
her way to shore

  as far as i could make out she finished
some of these greeks were to be left on ku-ku
island and the rest return for them but i
dont know how soon is there a treasure here
of really great value

  this bland said flower is mostly made of
phosphate rock-stuff that makes more fortunes
than gold ever made

  almost before light the next morning while i
was keeping watch -one of the greeks stole into
sight flower attacked him while jim grabbed
his pistol jims first shot killed the intruder

  the dead man was for all the world like the
brother of the corpse that had come ashore on
croker island we examined his eyes with care
but could see nothing wrong with them

  all the same he was as blind as a bat in the
daylight and pretty near blind at night declared
jim nice sort of an island i dont think

chapter viii

during the battles lull

the sea ladj had come out and was
standing on the beach her clothes
aflutter in the sunrise wind the
sunrise light of youth upon her
face how young she was i felt my one
and thirty years old beside the narrow tale
of hers and i felt glad spitefully glad that
flower was six years older

  thirty-seven i said to myself near
forty-why hes middle-aged

  it did not occur to me to think of jim
who might have had a year or so more
as verging on elderliness but then   

  are you going to shoot the greeks with
that pistol lady mary asked of flower

  i saw she was standing nearer to him
than to jim or me although there was
one might say an amplitude of room on

the beach i do not think she knew she
was doing it

  if we can he answered

  you could not shoot them all with
it she said

  no answered flower

  there would be some left

  it looks so

  and you might all be killed

  lets hope nothing so unpleasant will
happen

  but if you were-sapphira and i-

  sapphira and you-

  dont make me say it she said turn-
ing i thought a little paler

  i wont said flower with that direct
kind way of his i know what you
mean you are afraid of falling into their
hands you wont lady mary and you
wont need to keep that pistol for your-
self and sapphira either jim- he
beckoned to the miner- its time we
the terrible island

us

talked this matter out see that sapphira
and lady mary arent left alone at any
time when they are outside the cave not
for a minute you and i will divide the
duty dont you feel bad now ire-
land i dont know how he knew his
back had been toward me till he turned
to speak youre as good a man as any
of us but for one thing that you cant
run very fast youve got to be the
bravest man of us all

  how is that i asked him

   for this reason said flower strolling
away a little out of the earshot of the
women you cant defend yourself very
well since defense may mean simply clear-
ing out one-time at any moment and
-jim and i cant defend you it will
take all we can do to look after the
women

  each of them must have a strong arm
and a quick pair of feet near her all the
time in case of those devils trying a
snap-shot-you must remember we cant
be sure hot much they are or are not
able to see but you ireland-you with
your lameness i liked the clean simple
way he spoke of it you must face the
music alone

  theyve got you once-how is that
arm this morning by the way he be-
gan untying it as he talked because
you couldnt be quick enough and they
may get you again yours is the worst
risk but all the same i depend upon
vou

  right said i

  and it was understood without further
words that if lives were to be sacrificed
or risks taken to save another mine might
be the forfeit

  flower looked at the wound with a pro-
fessional eye

  not too bad he said but would
be better for some iodine well burn a
pile of seaweed get it down to ashes and
then ill tell you what to do carl slung
in a thousand table-bottles of quinine with
the stores because apparently that is
stores in new guinea but nothing else
i neednt tell you to keep up heart you
dont need to be told we must keep the
women cheerful

  do you think it a bad business all
round i asked

  he did not answer for a moment or two

  i dont know he said presently the

worst thing is that eye-trouble whatever
it is

  cant you make a shot at it i asked
remembering the medical training of
which he had told us

  not a guess-or rather so many
guesses that none of them is any good
where theres an effect theres a cause
island only inhabitable from november
till march-full of caves-has been a
guano island countless ages ago-might
be a line of inquiry and might not be-
hind any one of those facts lets come
back i think sapphira has made break-
fast afterward well tally off the stores
and have them served out properly no
knowing how long they may have to last
it was an odd meal the first break-
fast of ours on the island we ate it in-
side the cave lest any of the greeks
should by chance be possessed of enough
sight to come to the edge of the glacis
and send a bullet into the midst of us

  sapphira cooked in emptied tins jim
had picked up a few broken coconuts on
the beach trimmed them into cups with
his knife and cleaned them with sand
there was some wild taro growing among
the stones of the glacis its great flat
leaves two or three feet across made
ample plates for our food and small shells
were no bad substitute for spoons

  when we had done and sapphira who
scorned any aid had rinsed the cups in
the trickle of fresh water that ran down
the wall of the outer cave we laid out
all the stores and counted them there
was enough for something under four
weeks carefully managed

  of course said flower well use
them as little as possible and try for all
the stuff we can find in the shape of wild
vegetables or fruit or fish or coconuts
as this is pretty important i think well
have a hunt over the island do you
know anything about botany in general
jim im no great hand at it

  ask our scientific man suggested
jim i dont know a pea from a prussic-
acid bean

  is there prussic-acid beans asked
sapphira suspiciously

  why not said jim firmly and no
one seemed to be able to answer the in-
quiry though i saw the word potassium
trembling on flowers lip

  he turned away stroking his mus-
tache

  well come along he said to me
can you name any useful things

  im an entomologist i said but
you can hardly take that up as a pro-
fession without running more or less into
botany

  no i see that so youre going to be
the chief character of our boys romance

-desert island-

  desert-no such luck growled jim
desert island according to the usual
specifications persisted flower and
you know there always has to be a char-
acter who has seen all the plants before
and knows what they are good for

  i remember said jim i read about
them in the yankee papers about the
milk-tree that gives milk and the boot-
trees-i read about them in a yank maga-
zine-where you can pick a pair of wel-
lingtons or a satin slipper number small
two and the shrub that grows rum for

the bad characters and the-

  really i broke in for i was feeling
a little excited and rather important the
most awful mistakes are made about those
matters practically all the food-plants

except coconuts are cultivated and-

  suppose we go and solve the problem
by walking according to the classics
suggested flower

  oh i must go too said the sea lady
i always did love boys books better
than girls and its really most exciting
to be in a desert-island adventure
certainly said the surveyor jim
i know will take good care of sapphira
we dont want to ieave the stores un-
guarded

  i wouldnt presume to take care of
sapphira said jim i hope shell take
care of me wont you sapphira id
like to be told some more about all my
bad habits tell me about how i smoke
more than is good for my health-i just
love to hear that-and how i had three
more whiskies than i ought to have had
last time i went down to samarai for a
bit of fun and tell me again how youve
got no patience with me and how you
wish i was dead i think its good for me
to hear that

  sapphira eyed him much as one might
imagine a handsome gold-eyed wasp
would eye something or some one who

had painlessly drawn its sting and pre-
sumed to mock it we left them to dis-
cuss the rules of conduct and started on
our trip

  there was not a sign of any one of our
enemies about on the top of the island
the wind blew free and the grasses were
shaking the place was not very large 
and you could see the rim of sea all
round it-sea wonderfully colored like
sheets of chrysophrase and opal where the
reefs ran under and shading through pink
and lemon-ivory color into the blue of
deeper waters

  we walked with caution past the
mouth of the cave flower taking the
lead it had been blocked up inside in a
most ingenious way with piles of beer
and whisky-bottles arranged so that a
touch would eause them to fall down with
hideous clatter

  no catching those weasels asleep re-
marked flower after we had passed by
i think there is not much danger from
them in the day time it looks to me as if
the blindness that haunts this place didnt
work so completely at night

  theres a banana i saw them in the
west indies remarked lady mary

  oh said flower have you remem-
bered about the big ship with the guns
and how it brought you here

  what ship said the sea lady

  and i saw and he saw that the door
had closed again but she had made ad-
vance all the same she never hesitated
for an ordinary word now and i knew
that her remembrance of greater things
than those we wished to know had re-
turned to her for-dare i tell it-i had
heard her through the dusk and silence of
the cave murmuring her innocent little
prayers after we had all gone to rest

  well youve made the first score
said flower we stopped beneath the 
banana it was a very tall one i sup-
pose twenty feet in height with a great
bunch of fruit at the top

  i beg your pardon i corrected him
that is a wild banana	

  what

  yes the bunch of fruit stands right
up instead of drooping down that
would prove it alone but knock down
some of it with a stone if you want-
there uneatable you see and full of
seeds

romance
the terrible island



  no score decidedly said flower
and score one to me for i see citrons
i know you cant eat wild citrons but
you can drink them all right -

  we loaded ourselves with a few of the
great round rough golden fruits and
passed on

  score one cried the sea lady ex-
citedly she had found a bush with small
green fruits

  now swiss family robinson urged
flower dont let her cheat that is
uneatable ill bet my hat

  it is i pronounced

  forfeit lady mary cried the sur-
veyor

  no i said for shes got the best
thing yet-candle-nuts these have an
oily kernel that you can string on a coco-
nut-leaf rib they burn down and down
and are as good as any candle

  the sea lady rejoiced mocking at
flower in a way that i think he enjoyed
and that i know i did not we hunted
industriously and flower presently de-
clared that he had found raspberries but
that it wasnt possible so they must be
a delusion i told him they were real
but never much good below two-thousand-
feet level

  cherries said lady mary score
one

  i had a look at them they were too
long for my fancy more like red peppers
in shape i tasted one it was not bad
rather agreeable than otherwise but as i
could not identify the fruit t preferred to
let it alone spitting out for precaution
the one i had put in my mouth

  well give you half a mark till we try
it on a bird or something i suggested

  lady mary laughed poutingly

  you are none of you playing fair

  we continued our walk but found
nothing more until we got down to the
beach where i rather unfairly scored
two at once by telling flower that the
beach hibiscus with the yellow flowers
furnished excellent fibres and that the red
hibiscus we saw growing on the glacis
was admirable for blacking shoes

  you rub the petals on your shoes
i explained

  that oughtnt to count said lady
mary because we shall never black our
bools at all people on desert islands
never do im sure

ro m

  very well i said ill give that up
and put in another i think thats the
paper mulberry growing in the gully
if theres more of it on the island we
may be very glad of it

  we arent likely to write many let-
ters objected the sea lady anxious to
win her game

  no but we may wear out some of our
clothes

  and how on earth is a little shrub
with horrid little rough leaves going to
dress us

  it dresses most of papua away from
civilization you can beat tappa cloth
out of the inner bark

  tell me some more clothes you can
get in the bush asked the sea lady re-
garding me with an interest that warmed
my heart

  havent you seen the canvas that
grows on the coconut

  im afraid im awfully unobservant
i havent

  oh almost nobody does notice it i
cant think why but if you are an ento-
mologist of course you are always poking
round the bark of trees take a piece
yourself its wrapped round the shoots
she picked out a young coconut stand-
ing close to high-water mark and reached
up into its crown

  oh oh how wonderful she cried
it is real canvas brown canvas with a
warp and a weft oh how does the tree
ever weave it and what big pieces
like the gores of skirts oh mr ire-
land i must have a coconut dress to-
day where can i get needles and
thread

  i can show you a dozen plants with
excellent thread-that wild banana for
one but as to needles- i paused i
was fairly graveled there are no vege-
table needles of decent quality

  flower i think had had enough of my
small triumph if he possessed a weak-
ness it was the desire to lead

  if curved needles will serve you lady
mary he put in i can spare one for
you and one for sapphira ive almost
forgotten i ever studied medicine but i
do carry a pocket-case

  now she turned to him and i could
see she was more grateful for that promise
of a needle than for all i had found and
told about but all she said was
beatrice grimshaw

  how very providential that you did
study medicine think if any one should
be ill

  i never practised i did not even go
up for my degree he reminded her

   i think we could tust you she said
and those golden eyes of hers looked up
into his

    its beginning its beginning i said
to myself damn it i thought as i
limped away along the beach toward the
cave but what i was damning or what
i thought was beginning i could not
easily have put into words

  this girl was almost certainly engaged
to some one called cedric she was cer-
tainly of a disposition almost quixotically
honorable flower was not the man to
steal another mans sweetheart especially
under such circumstances and as for
me i did not come in anywhere or any-
how what was there to curse

  jim when i reached the cave was sit-
ting outside it on a heap of ejected
bracken looking quizzical and smoking a
pipe

  wheres sapphira i asked

  making the beds said jim

  a volley of bracken-i can call it
nothing else-was fired out of the cave at
the same moment and half-buried him in
its descent he shook it aside like a
water-dog shaking off water

  thats one shes making he ex-
plained shes swept up all the caves
nicely with a coconut-broom and shes
scrubbed all the opened tins with sand
and put them in rows according to size
on the ridges of the walls and shes
cleaned off all the green that the water
makes trickling down itll last nice and
clean till tomorrow and by and by shes
going to tackle all that untidy stuff that
the waves have thrown up close to the
cave and have it burned in a heap
and-

  did you stand by and let her do all
that work i asked

  she drove me out with the broom
explained jim equably i told her all
the things she ought to do and of course
she couldnt let a mere ignorant man
know more than her so she invented a few
more and then shooed me out

  wont she be frightfully tired i
suggested listening to the sounds of

scraping and throwing about that were
going on inside

  her troubles was jims comment
what did you find on top

  but i was not chiefly interested at that
moment in what we had found on top

  jim i said with what might have
seemed irrelevance to an onlooker did
you ever do any horse-breaking
whips of it he replied cocking a
mischievous eye at me

  did any of them ever get the better
of you

  dont seem to remember it if they
did

  how did you do it

  kept them going till they were tired
  and if they jibbed or boiled

  kept them jibbing or bolting what
are you getting at you little devil

  im trying the socratic method on you
jim

  i know as much about socrates as you
do averred jim and bar the pronuncia-
tion which on his tongue rhymed to
dates he may well have been right

  just answer another jim what did
you do wih a horse when youd broken
it

  your turn to answer said rocky
jim what did they do to socrates
they poisoned him i was compelled
to stae

  moral plain said jim getting to his
feet im going for a walk

  and i was left to reflect not for the
first time that few people were able to
boast of having got change out of
jim

  nor was i altogether gratified for once
to hear the sea ladys golden laughter
close at hand

chapter ix

the mysterious box

now began our life on the island
the first problem we had to solve
was the matter of signals it was true
that few ships or none ever came within
sight of this far outlier of lusancays the
place was on the road to nowhere it was
dangerous even to steamers because of its

  nevertheless some chance might send a
ship in our way and we could not afford
to neglect it probably the cutter of the
half-caste greeks would be the first to
turn up

  well that had to be risked we thought
we might be able to make them hear rea-
son but we hoped very hard that some
surveying man-of-war or some schooner
driven out of her course might run near
enough to sight the island before the
greek boat came

  she is a good bit overdue pointed
out flower if they went to samarai
for stores they ought to be here by now
of course if they went on to port moresby

to make application for the island-

  i dont think they did said jim
  why not

  couldnt say i just dont think it
im willing to suppose shes met with
some bad luck you must remember lady
mary told us they were half-drunk

  well however that may be per-
sisted flower a signal we must have
a permanent one flying from one of the
trees and a smoke as nearly all the time
as we can manage it

  did you ever said jim try to keep
up a permanent smoke-signal it takes
one man doing nothing else all the time
but humping wood and tending it-be-
cause it blazes or goes out if you dont
look after it

  besides put in sapphira-we were
talking in the cave after supper on one
of these first days i cant be sure which
-the natives are always making smokes
when they burn off for their gardens no
one would take any notice of a smoke on
an island anywhere about new guinea
must be a flag on the top of a palm-
tree trunk then declared flower we
can do without that piece of sail now
since sapphira has made our blankets-
she had spent the whole of that day with
lady marys assistance sewing together
wads of coconut canvas for the beds-
and if we cut the top off a palm it will
make a fine flag-staff

  i never saw the white man yet who
could climb a coconut remarked jim

  time you did then was flowers re-
ply

  and he gave us all the exhibition next
day he did not attempt the dangerous
and all but impossible feat-for a white

man-of shinning the tree he cut
sharp-ended pegs of hardwood hammered
them in with a heavy stone as far up as
he could reach and then stood on them
to hammer more in spite of his great
bulk he was exceedingly agile and active
the task was no easy one but he carried
it through before long a dingy banner
of sail-cloth floated from the top of the
decapitated palm carrying its message
across the sea

  we were all well pleased it seemed
that a step toward freedom had been
taken

  but next morning the palm was lying
prone on the ground chopped off through
the trunk

  neither of the women was about when
we found it i thought it just as well
jim would surely have burst if he had
been compelled to retain in his system the
flood of descriptive language that came
forth when he caught sight of the chopped-
down signal-tree

  i gathered without much difficulty that
he held the greeks responsible and that
he disapproved of them singly collec-
tively presently and retrospectively and
also of all the work of their hands past
present and to come

  flower put his hands in his trouser
pockets looked at the tree and remarked
simply damn

  i said that some one of the greeks
must be able to see a bit more than we
thought

  i shouldnt be surprized if the whole
lot of them could see fairly well at night
mused flower there was some dilation
of the pupil in the case of that man that
jim shot

  we cant signal thats clear i la-
mented

  flower said nothing but later on i
saw him busy collecting pieces of drift-
wood and aimlessly as it seemed carry-
ing them to the top of the island and
throwing them into the sea after he had
thrown them he would stand watching
them for an hour or more i wondered
if he were going out of his senses

  no he isnt said the sea lady when
i gave voice to my fears he has some-
thing in his mind he doesnt mean to
tell

  i saw how she spoke for him and how
she took it for granted that she under-

stood him better than any one else did

  you dont then said i to myself
women always think they understand
the man they take an interest in but
as often as not theyre only dressing him
up in their own fancies but aloud i
only said well lets hope it is all right

  the sea lady stood watching him for a
minute and then she did a curious thing
she went down to the beach where a
few of the many bottles that the greeks
had strewn about the island lay gathered
in chinks and openings of the rocks she
picked up a couple of them and carried
them to flower

  lady mary lady mary you mustnt
wait on me he exclaimed turning round
from his earnest gazing at the sea and
taking the bottles from her hands
thank you all the same then he
seemed to awake flow did you know
i wanted these

  the sea lady stooped to tie her shoe
i like a fool came forward eagerly to
do it for her and then i saw that she
had bent down her head to hide her face

  she let me tighten the lace the while
she stood up bravely with a telltale glow
on her usually pale cheeks

  i-just knew was all she said then
after a pause-for i think the sudden fire
in the big mans eyes was a little too
warm for her to bear-great minds think
together you know she said with an air
of lightness bending down again to that
troublesome shoe and i wiser this time
let her adjust it herself

  i went away what else could i do

  later i saw them together on the beach
busy filling bottles with wide leaves on
which flower had written some message
with a thorn and corking them up with
corks that any one of us could find for
the gathering in the neighborhood of the
cave where the greeks kept hidden all day
flower had wax too from the candle-
nuts i had discovered and smeared the
corks well with it when they were driven
home then he and the sea lady lashed
the bottles to little rafts of driftwood
i stood watching for quite a while i
did not offer to help for i knew they
would rather be left alone

  it was the sea ladys idea to put sails
on the tiny crafts that carried our hopes
of freedom she had been knotting and
fastening the fibers that secured the bottles

with true sailor skill-all the work of
her hands was neat finished and effec-
tive there were no loose ends about lady
mary-and by and by she took a sharp
sliver of driftwood and began hammer-
ing it into the little raft

  let me do that said flower what
do you want

   would they not go farther and faster
with sails she asked

  i was depending on the currents i
estimate them at seven knots an hour in
some places-however the sail could do
no harm

  let me she pleaded they are such
pretty toys

  toys when one came to think of it it
could not have been more than five years
or so since she was playing with actual
toys herself and yet she had three men
that i knew of held in the hollow of those
flower-like hands and how many of whom
i did not know

  what was it we all loved in the sea
lady i asked myself the question often
enough in those days she was very
very pretty but it was not that she
was young unmarked unfurrowed in body
and mind as a lily or a bloomy peach
but it was not that

  she was as brave as nelson as gentle as
her own grandmother and as brilliant and
self-helpful as probably her own grand-
daughters would be but you do not love
a girl because she balances gracefully
between the generations catching the sun-
set gold and the sunrise glow alike

  why did her world find the sea lady
irresistible i might answer that question
now by asking another but i did not
know the other in those days-not even
when i looked at our sea lady and saw
something in her face and vaguely sensed
something in the pretty names we gave
her that seemed to point toward a solu-
tion of puzzles unsolved

  well i gave it up for the moment
and pleased myself by watching her she
had hammered the slip of wood home now
and flower had hammered one or two
others on one or two other rafts and
they got the indispensable coconut can-
vas and made little sails out of it and
set them cunningly on the tiny masts so
that the fairy ships would sail with any-
thing approaching to a fair wind

  and then they carried the fleet down

              mrrn i r o m ance llf  
the terrible island

 

to the sea-channel where the tide was
running out strongly toward the outer
walls of the island and put them in and
craned their necks to watch the ships go
out

  and afterward they and we went up
to the top of the island to see the little
vessels floating away and away they
went surprizingly fast tiny as they were
we saw them make their way through the
reefs as if they had each a pilot aboard

  will any one ever find them i wonder
said the sea lady looking wistfully toward
the little ships

  i knew what she was longing-that she
and perhaps another were on the decks
of the fairy fleet sailing away and away
from the terrible island it seemed hard
that the little boats could go and that
we could not

  you know how it is when you write a
letter to one far away and wish and
wish that you could slip yourself inside
the envelope to go with it whither it was
going well i think she was feeling
somewhat after that fashion and i
know so did i feel

  the fleet had better luck than the tree-
signal but we did not rely on it over-
much all this time i need hardly say
the greeks were constantly in our minds
it seemed absurd that we two strong
men and another and two women in the
full possession of health and strength
should be terrorized by the miscreants
in the cave yet a way out of the diffi-
culty was hard to find

  they had plenty of firearms and am-
munition we had one revolver and two
cartridges they were absolutely un-
scrupulous as to ways and means we knew
there were many things at which we
should draw the line-shooting them as
they had attempted to shoot us when we
were supposed to be asleep for example
this matter had been debated between
us flower held that it could not be man-
aged in any case since the greeks kept
their cave thoroughly closed all day time
and that therefore we need not discuss
the idea

  jim and for the matter of that my-
self had a notion that some way might
be found but as we were all agreed that
the act was impossible to us that made
little difference

  on one thing we were agreed-that some

means of making the island safe might
be and should be found flower de-
cided that as a preliminary he would
spend a night concealed near the greeks
cave and keep watch on their actions

  theres no knowing what we may pick
up about them that would be of use to
us he said

  jim cheerfully preparing to share his
vigil was curtly told to show a little com-
mon sense

  you must stay down at our own cave
and look after lady mary and sapphira
explained flower we cant leave them
to ireland but i shall be very glad to
have ireland with me

  so he salved the wound he could not
help inflicting

  we found a place to hide ourselves in
before the sun was down there was not
much difficulty about it the piles of over-
grown coral rock near the caves furnished
more refuges than one and we had only
to choose

  you find one ireland said flower
while i take a walk round and see none
of the brutes are out

  you have seen the dolmens menhirs
kit-cote houses of france and england
no doubt or if not those photographs of
them which are common in many tourists
resorts i fixed on a sort of natural dol-
men a little cavern made by a large rock
lying on the top of two or three smaller
ones

  once inside this with the trailing
vines draped down in front of the open-
ing not a soul could have seen us even
in broad daylight much less in the sec-
ond-quarter moon that we expected
flower and i got ourselves safely into it
before the light failed and waited we
did not dare to smoke mosquitoes were
active and our quarters cramped the
wait promised to be a long and an un-
comfortable one

  it did not last half an hour no sooner
was the light fairly out of the sky and
the thin moon climbing up from the east
than the bottle barricade began to clink
furiously inside the cave they were com-
ing out

  forth they came four of them stumb-
ling and feeling their way

  why i whispered to flower theyre
all as blind as bats

  wait a bit said flower

  the fourth man walked with more cer-
tainty than the rest he did not pause
at the entrance as they did and then
feel for the nearest rock and sit down on
it yawning and stretching he stood
erect and walked forward

  i thought he was looking about him
though his sight was clearly not normal
he strained his head forward lifted his
chin and peered through half-closed eye-
lids

  having satisfied himself that no one
was about he spoke to the three others
they lurched forward and took their
seats on a flat rock while the first man
went into the cave again and came back
with a load of tins i felt rather dis-
spirited as i saw the liberal helpings of
food that he distributed to the company
squatted on the rock it was clear they
had plenty of everything

  they ate largely picking the meat out
of the tins with their knives and tossing
it rudely down their throats they passed
round a bottle of gin and drank out of
the neck it was a weird scene up on the
top of the lonely windy island under the
feeble moon

  the men were dressed in the rough
khaki stuffs that are popular in new
guinea away from the townships they
seemed almost to melt into their sur-
roundings in that pale light one could
have imagined them to be so many gi-
gantic fungi growing on the rock but for
their occasional movements

  above them the flag-like leaves of wild
bananas flapped against the sky on the
high summits of the coconuts eighty
feet in air huge plumes moon-silvered
writhed and beat among the glittering
claws of scorpio and eclipsed and snowed
and eclipsed again the white lamps of the
southern cross and the wind cried in
the grasses and the lonely sea complained
below

  hunger satisfied the greeks rose and
stretched their limbs with animal yawns
and howls-they lighted pipes and smoked
they lurched about the open spaces try-
ing to obtain what exercise they might
after their cramped day in the cave

  we heard them talking to one another
but it was all in greek or in some bastard
graeco-malay dialect that gilbert murray
himself could not have made head or tail
of what flower and i guessed of their

 sayings was put together out of their
 gestures which were like those of all half-
 civilized people very free and expressive

   the three men who were completely
 blind seemed to be abusing the partially
 blind man perhaps for having brought
 them to the island perhaps for having
 failed to guard sufficiently against the evil
 that had struck the whole crew

   i saw them raise their hands to heaven
 and shake their fists in a kind of despair-
 ing way and once or twice one of them
 struck at his blinded eyes as a dog bites
 at the wound that smarts and burns the
 other man seemed to be trying to calm
 them down

   we noticed that he pointed more than
 once to the beach below and laid his
 hand upon the big navy revolver in his
 belt when he did this the other men
 mechanically felt for their revolvers and
 one of them once facing down toward
 the caves where he supposed us to be
 spat fiercely

   by and by the man who could see ap-
 peared to tell them that he was going to
 the beach it had been our habit of late
 to sit out on the sand at dusk cooling
 down after the heat of the day i guessed
 that the greek intended to try a snap-
 shot from some safe corner and my heart
 seemed to turn over in my breast as i
 realized that jim and the women would
 not know he was coming and would prob-
 ably expose themselves to his fire but
 flower had seen that as soon as i did
 he gathered himself up slipped out of
 the shelter-hole and whispering to me to
 await his return ran after the greek

   i thought to myself watching him go
 that it was indeed a lucky chance that
 had sent us to the island provided with a
 pair of rubber-soled shoes apiece for the
 rock-climbing we expected

   those shoes they are goodt thingce to
 take carl had said in that breaking-
 neck place they may save your life

   they had done that already more than
 once in the hideous game of blind mans
 buff we were compelled to play

   left alone with the three blind men i
 kept quiet and on the watch i knew that
 any unguarded movement of mine would
 send a hail of lead pouring in my direction
 and i had no wish at all to stop a bullet-
 probably dum-dumed-from one of those
 s

ance r---

 ii

  for some few minutes the men remained
as they had been left only shifting their
position so far as to stand a little closer
and back to back in a triangle it was
plain that they were taking no chances
this movement brought them nearer to
me and with the temporary dying down of
the wind i was able to hear clearly a
few of the words that passed between
them

  i am no mighty greek-scholar but i
have passed my b a degree and modern
greek is very like its ancient prototype
in a large number of verbs and nouns
i was almost sure that they were talking
about a box what box they seemed
to set a value on it

  and that word is girl if i am not
mistaken i thought box and girl-
what have they to do with-

  one of the men repeated the words and
this time he motioned with his hand toward
the cave

  instantly a new thought struck me
they were talking of something that be-
longed to the sea lady

  if i had been attentive before i was
all one strain of attention now i didnt
hold my breath-one does not-but i re-
member i listened with my mouth as wide
open as a frogs that helps you to hear
i heard more i understood another word
or two helped out by gesture they
were saying that she ought to be where
her box was and one of them kissed an
imaginary riiaiden

  i have never since then blamed juries
foracquitting a murderer under the un-
written law in the flash of blood-lust
that went through me like a jag of light-
ning and left me dry-lipped and shaking
there in my liiding-hole i understood
once for all how men kill because of a
woman and how other men in defiance of
law forgive them

  and now i was not afraid at all of
those blunt-nosed bullets of theirs i
called myself a craven for thinking such
blinded brutes worthy of fear i was
determined coldly and unalterably de-
termined on knowing the secret of their
cave before flower had time to chase
the seeing villain back again or to shoot
him with one of our two precious cart-
ridges

  have you ever been to new zealand
do you know the dragons mouth-the

cavern that is full of fiercely boiling water
for eighteen minutes and a half out of
every twenty and empty for the remain-
ing ninety seconds have you ever in
company with a guide made callous by
continual risks gone down into that cav-
crn while it is dripping and steaming with
the breath of the newly withdrawn waters
and climbed through and out again death
dragging on the soles of your feet before
the furious flood comes back with a howl
of escaping steam

  lame as i am i have done it i felt
that night up on top of the terrible
island when i crawled with exceeding
care out of my hiding-hole and made for
the empty cavern as if i were taking
once again that nightmare trip through
the dragons cave if one did not get
out in time   

  the three greeks were listening intently
for any sound from the direction of our
beach i think that may have drawn their
attention off in some degree at all
events they did not hear me as i crept
out of the hole rose slowly to my feet
and walked on the balls of my toes to the
cave-opening

  i did not dare to light a match the
scratching would have betrayed me i
could only feel my way down the slope
where we had sheltered on the day of the
storm and into the opening from which
we had seen the greek come forth

  if they came back and caught me i
knew i shouldnt have a dogs chance of
escaping their bullets in that confined
space but after what i had heard i
just had to go and that was all there was
to it

  the cave was not nearly so large as
i had expected four or five short strides
even of my lame leg brought me across
it ten feet or so i thought i tried
it the other way it was two or three
yards longer no doubt there were other
caves i hoped i had got the right one

  i got down on my hands and knees
and began clawing round the walls if
they had a box it was ten to one they
would use it as a seat in that case i
should find it somewhere on the floor

  i came across a number of other things
-blankets coconut-shells heaps of oil
tins loose bottles and more than once
only the greatest care saved me from mak-
ing a noise by displacing some of these

miscellaneous goods but no box i stood
up and felt round the walls i was al-
most frantic

  it could not be long till the man who
could see returned or until some alarm
connected with his absence caused the
others to seek refuge in the cave-indeed
i wondered that nothing had happened
yet

  surely flower must have caught up the
greek-surely the three outside would
know by this time that everything was
not right

  was that one of them coming back i
halted scarcely daring to breathe no
i had only heard the sound of water
dripping somewhere in unknown crevices
the men were still outside i fumbled
on about the walls surely i must have
gone almost round

  my fingers struck on something smooth
and hard in the same instant i heard
an unmistakable sound of scuffling out-
side they were coming back

  i grabbed the thing i had touched it
was undoubtedly a box small and cov-
ered with something that felt like leather
i got out of the cave as quickly as i
could there was some little light from
the sky on the way back although coming
in i had been in utter darkness could
i get up the slope in time-were they   

  against the spangled violet of the night
rose three dense black shadows i was
trapped

  there was only one thing to do-flatten
myself against the wall of the descending
passage and hope for the best if any
one of the men happened to touch me in
passing i did not rate my chances of
escaping very high

  apart from my lameness and apart
from the pistols they carried every one
of the men was exceedingly handy with a
knife like all his kind and could whip a
blade out of his belt and into something
warm and human while a more civilized
type of man would be wondering if there
was really anything there i squeezed my-
self up against the dank limestone of the
passage and hoped the greeks might walk
fairly straight

  they came grunting and shambling
down the slopes one of them was smoking

  it fell out of his mouth he stooped felt
about for it and picked it up again strik-
ing a match to relight it

  my heart gave a horrid jump as the
flame shot up but i realized almost at
once that they could not see me and that
i had now an opportunity to glance at
the box the match flickered wavered
went out but i had had a look i was
carrying a leather-covered dressing-case

  after that i would have faced the devil
himself to get my booty safely away for
i was certain that the case was our sea
ladys it might have papers inside it
might have jewelry it might have all
sorts of things that would serve to identify
her-if only i could get safely away

  two of the men passed me with a wide
margin of safety i flattened myself i
against the wall of the cavern and felt as
one does when one is overtaken by a train
in a tunnel or cutting with no refuge
at hand to get into

  the third man was walking unsteadily
he smelt strongly of gin and i made no
doubt he had more than his share of the
bottle they had been handing round he
passed me with the smallest possible mar-
gin and then staggering slightly stretched
out one hand to steady himself against
the wall the hand descended flat upon
my face

  he raised a wild whoop and snatched at
my nose with one hand while with the
other he fumbled about his belt if he
had not been half-drunk there would
have been the end of owen ireland but
providentially he was and that gave me
the moment i wanted to duck away

  of course the other two had flung round
instantly and they were sober cursing
me in greek-i cant say how strange
those fragments of academic culture
sounded in such a place and from such
lips as theirs-they made for me like dogs
falling on a hare

  i had not time to think-one acts by
instinct in such moments as these there
was just light enough from the starry sky
and the pale moon outside the cave for me
to see where i was going i dodged but
not into the open passage and out at the
entranceway instinct shouted to me to
get back where they would least expect
me to go-into the cave

  in their eagerness to seize me they had
collided against one another but they drew
apart at once and all three swung round
toward the cave-mouth fired in the direc-
tion of the opening

romance
the terrible island

  they would have got me sure with
that i said to myself and then stumbled
and scrambled out i went after them
as quietly as i could thanking heaven and
carl again for those rubber shoes

  they never thought of guarding the
cave-mouth but spread themselves out
beyond it near the rocky table where they
had supped and stood listening their re-
volvers in their hands

  the night had become very still there
was not a sound but the faint breathing of
the pacific far below and now and again
the winnowing of some huge fruit-bats
wings i saw the men stand silhouetted
against the stars you might have thought
them images of black stone

  now this was a pretty pickle because
i could not like flower or rocky jim
move easily without making a noise my
lameness handicapped me i never could
be sure the weak foot would not drag

  it was impossible for me to steal past
those three listening forms on the track
and if i got off it the rustling of the
grasses would have been as good-or as
bad-as a bell about my neck i saw
nothing for me to do but keep quiet in
the cave-mouth ready to move as soon as
i saw a chance

  i wonder i thought to myself if
ill be alive in five minutes time-in half
an hour and i looked up with mingled
curiosity and awe to the glorious spangling
of the stars overhead was their secret
in a little while to be mine

  then i remembered that whatever won-
ders and glories might be the heritage of
my departed soul voyaging loose in the
universe there would not be from the
outermost of the far-fixed stars to the
near familiar moon roaming now among
the silvered vanes of the palm-trees the
face of one dear woman the sound of
her golden voice and eternity seemed
cold and more than ever i was resolved
that my life should not end here and-
now at the will of these eyeless brutes

  i know shes not for me i thought
but i want to be on the same earth with
her as long as she treads it if she were
in tasmania and i in the klondvke it
would still be something to know that the
same old world held us both-that we
went spinning round the sun together

  i clutched the leather dressing-case more
tightly under my arm and swore that i

would surely get away clear with it-to
her

  i dont really know how i intended to
manage the business but i am sure i
should have worked out some plan or
other as it was fate decided for me i
had not been standing there in the cave-
mouth for more than a minute or so when
i heard the noise of feet running hard
along the track and of a voice shouting
something in greek the man who could
see was coming back

  what he said must have been a warning
for the other three men dropping their
hunt after me made for the cave-opening
as fast as they could arms stretched out
and hands feeling the way they could
not go very fast i saw that i might have
time covered by the noise of their move-
ment to get out of the cave pass the
greeks somehow or other on the track and
get myself hidden before the fourth man
arrived but it would be touch and go
if i could have moved as quickly as
flower

  well i could not and that was all
there was to it i crept at the best speed
i could muster along the wall of the
entrance slope reached the opening and-
slung myself round the corner of it just
as the first of the three men groped his
way to the place where i had been stand-
ing a couple of seconds before

  i cast a look down the track white
moon and the trembling shadows of
palms a fruit-bat winging through the
stars the night-wind stirring the plumes
of the pampas-grass as yet no more
i scuttled out on to the track pad-pad came
the feet drawing nearer he would be in
sight immediately reckless of making
sound now i flung myself into the cave
refuge where flower and i had been keep-
ing watch

  i barked elbows and knees i wrenched
one foot cruelly i knocked-the wind out
of my lean body as i fell-but i fell in-
side and just as i fell i heard the feet
come pat-pat up behind me and pass me
like the wind

  no he had not seen he was in a
hurry to get back to the cave no doubt
he had looked neither to the right nor to
left but kept straight on it had been a
very narrow escape i hugged the box
tighter we were nearly out of the wood
now the greek rushed down the cave

slope and in another minute i heard a
babel of voices beginning

  i got up and out and in spite of my
lameness and my wrenched foot went hob-
bling at a pretty good pace toward the
slope and the way to the beach it would
not take them long to talk things over
and if they started hunting for me with
the help of the man who could see   
flower i gasped

  the big surveyor was coming back
why ireland he said halting did
the brute get away

  hes into the cave by now i said

i hope ta god he-

  oh no he didnt get any one he
saw me worse luck or id have had him
it would have been worth risking one of
our cartridges this isnt a healthy place
just now wed best get back

  i was with him there the whole length
of the pathway lay open to fire and the
moon was climbing higher and growing
brighter every minute

  give us your arm said flower we
hurried along together no use chasing
after him now regretted the big man
hes safe what have you got under
your arm

  box dressing-case i gasped

we were slamming along at a five-mile
gait i really dont think he knew that
he was hauling me like a bundle of wash
dressing-how-much is it a joke
its lady marys i panted

flower with the steady remembrance of
the job in hand that always characterized
him got me and himself under the lee of
the slope before he stopped and burst out
where did you get it what is it

how do you know-

  i got into the cave for a minute while
the men were out i explained

  and in a few words i related my adven-
ture

  i thought he would have stove in my
spine he clapped me on the back like a
housemaid beating a pillow

  you-plucky little devil he swore

i wouldnt have done it myself

  im quite sure you would and better

i coughed lets get on i cant be
easy till we have the thing in safety

   they were all waiting for us outside the
cave when we arrived the sound of shots
had been heard down on the beach lady
mary and sapphira in the light of our

driftwood fire looked anxious and pale-
faced as if they had been listening and
wondering jim was seated comfortably
on a flat stone eating coconut i do not
think he was very fond of it but he said
it passed the time

  i reckoned youd get back all right
he observed comfortably shifting a hunk
of nut from one cheek to the other

  but when he heard about the box he
was as much excited as any one i handed
it over to lady mary we all went into
the cave and jim lighted up with prodigal
display almost the whole of our stock of
candlenut torches

  we crowded round the sea lady of
course we should have looked away and
pretended not to take any undue interest
in her private property but we simply
couldnt do it

  its locked said jim

  its been broken open said flower

  he tas right the lock closed but did
not catch the box now i saw it in full
light was a beautiful thing deepest violet
russia leather with handles lock and
name-plate of engraved brass on the
plate all eyes were instantly fixed

  i can not hope to tell you how dis-
appointed we were when we saw that it
was engraved with a christian name alone
alix cut evidently in facsimile of a
written signature

  is that your name asked flower of
the sea lady

  she held the box in her hands looking
curiously at the plate

  i dont know she said presently rais-
ing her head you call me lady mary

  alix said flower alix does that
recall anything to you

  she stood looking at him her lips a
little apart the delicate line of her eye-
brows seeming to waver i do not think
for an instant he knew but he had spoken
her name in the accent of a lover it
seemed to me that she was listening not
to what he said but to that tone

  alix he said again

  lady mary put in jim if you dont
open that box soon some of us are just
going to curl up and die of suppressed
curiosity

  you suppress it a lot dont you
commented sapphira

  im not sure that it is mine said the
sea lady i cant remember
the terrible island



  and the old distressed expression that
we had not seen for long came clouding
over her face again

  better open it and see counseled
flower

  the sea lady obeying him as she always
did put the box in his hands the while she
manipulated the lid it seemed to me
and i dare sa to the rest that her fingers
moved as if they were familiar with their
ground in a few seconds she had loosed
the lid and the dressing-case was open

  it was a wreck

  there had been bottles jars toilet-appli-
ances of all kinds fitted into it one
could see by the numberless morocco loops
differently sized and shaped

  there was still a writing-case delicately
tooled but devoid of pencils and pens
there was a beautiful small jewel-case
removable but fastened in with catches
it had been roughly dragged open and the
velvet linings were torn loose apparently
in search for some secret recess it was
empty the case had been most thor-
oughly looted

  thats been silver fittings it had-
likely solid said sapphira relishingly
the brutes have ripped loose every bit of
metal

  not every bit said jim who had
taken the case up and was turning it
slowly over they missed this he
laid his finger on the name-plate which
we had supposed to be engraved brass
thats gold said the miner and the
handles

  then i suggested the fittings must
certainly have been gold too no wonder
they looted it

  gold said sapphira almost smacking
her lips thats doing it proper that
is but i might have known it when
she was thrown ashore herlittle shimmy
went on sapphira narratively was like a
spiders web trimmed with the frost off
of a window-pane

  i felt grateful to jim for foregoing the
mischievous comment that i saw twinkling
in his eye

  here said flower somewhat hur-
riedly give it back till i have another
look may i hunt right through it lady
mary

  oh please do she said

  she was not nearly so much interested
as the rest of us were the question of her

own identity did not seem to sit very
heavily on her mind but she watched
with attention while the big mans big
dexterous fingers felt all over the case
inside and outside to ascertain whether
anything of interest value or significance
had been left behind by the robbers

  i did not expect that anything would
come of the search but flower was de-
termined to have the last secrets out of
the box and his efforts did not go unre-
warded a flat morocco letter-case came
to light

  now we have it said the surveyor in
a satisfied tone this is certainly some
of your property and he handed the
case unopened to the sea lady

  she drew out of it a simple letter
written on foreign paper i saw her turn
it over but not a gleam of expression
came into her face

  i do not think it is mine she said
will you read it

  aloud said flower

  why not she answered him

  he looked at her curiously but took
the letter we were all standing round
him none of us had thought to sit down
the light from the candlenut torches
smoky and glaring fell on the ring of
interested faces of which the calmest and
least interested was certainly that of the
sea lady

  flower read

g- club piccadilly

  my darling alix

  i have written to you already by this mail-
though indeed i scarcely expect my letter will
catch you up on your flying journey i am
writing again not because there is anything
special i have to say but because i must repeat
just once more how i love you and how sweet
you looked that day down at liverpool when i
saw you off by the ever-to-be cursed caronia
alix alix alix get quite well soon and come
back quickly you are rich in unspent years
but i am so poor that i grudge every day you
spend away

  i saw h m the other day she was most
gracious and asked me to send you her kindest
regards she tells me that it is a poor return i
make for favor in taking away the best of all
her maids and i can only agree with her but
man is selfish dear you should have heard how
she spoke of that other maid it seems more
like twenty days than over twenty years she
said since margaret went away i shall not
easily forget her she said but your little alix
is sweeter she looked at me as if she would
have said much h m forgets nothing and
you of all people dont need to be told what her
lovely tactfulness can be

  enjoy yourself enjoy yourself-i grudge you
nothing though i wish it could have been shared
by me tell lady grace to guard my jewel
i almost fear to let it go so far from my safe-
keeping i came up to town yesterday the
court looked so lovely i was loath to leave it
behind they arc working hard at the dutch
garden and i hope it may be worthy of its
mistress i got adams mantelpiece it will re-
place that jacobean one that was damaged
queen elizabeths bedroom is being cannily
treated but some of that paneling has simply got
to come down and be replaced  agree with you
about the engravings they are banished to the
housekeepers room for all i can do to the
place for all the many people it harbors the
court looks empty and sad it waits like its
owner

  good night alix sweet alix so like your
godmother i pray the seven seas may treat you
ever kindly and carry you back safe to old
england and your petitioner will ever pray
always yours only

c de c

  there was silence in the cave after the
reading of the paper flower folded up
the sheet put it back into the violet mo-
rocco case and handed it to the sea lady
without a word i did not dare to look at
his face

  the pause was broken by sapphira

  well if thats not a nice love-letter-
and do you know anything about them
people dearie

  i do not know answered the sea lady

  there was struggle almost pain visible
on her face

  its written to some girl in service in
a big house whos gone traveling with her
mistress i reckon they say things about
a maid and taking her away id guess
the chap who wrote it was the steward or
bailiff or something of the place they call
the court he seems to have a lot to do
with the repairs well its an interesting
letter but it dont tell us much does it
dearie and how do you think you ever
got it in that dressing-case of yours was
it your maid that it was written to

  the sea lady was silent i doubt if she
heard a word

  i wondered that flower who had been
so keen on helping her to recover her mem-
ory had nothing now to say it seemed
a matter of no moment to him-to judge
by his demeanor-whether the sea lady
ever recovered her memory again or not

  and yet this was far and away the best
and biggest chance that had ever presented
itself of lifting up the dark curtain that

heretofore had covered all her past could
he not even ask her a question or two

  i fancied that memory must be very near
to dawning in her mind of course i
did not take sapphiras view of the letter

i guessed more accurately than any one
else in that place was likely to do the
full astonishing significance it bore but
what use was that or anything else as
long as the sea lady could not remember

  and still flower was silent

  it was jim who spoke

  what about turning in ive got first
watch and i want to get it over

  give it to me said flower speaking
for the first time since he had handed the
letter back to the sea lady i dont feel
sleepy ill look out now and you can
have the middle watch

  sapphira and the sea lady went into
their cave flower the handy man had
made them a partition of woven palm-
leaves with a sort of swinging flap for a
door so that they enjoyed complete
privacy jim dropped down on his bed
of bracken and coconut canvas flung his
arms above his head and sank instantly to
sleep

  i lay down near the doorway it was a
warmish night and i wanted to feel the
breeze on my face and look at the stars
as i lay old tropic wanderers will want
to know what we were doing about mos-
quito-nets there is no sleeping in hot
countries without them i can answer that
we were very well off in that particular

  the ever useful coconut canvas open in
texture and capable of being split to dif-
ferent thicknesses had been sewn into nets
that did all that was required but
ku-kus island was not much troubled
with mosquitoes and often enough we did
not lower the nets till near morning

  i lay then with my face to the open
sky waiting for the sleep that i knew
would be long in coming on me and me
alone of the company the weight of a
great secret had descended i knew about
lady mary

  her name it is true i did not yet know
but a single telegram sent to any center of
civilization when-or if-we got away
from the island would bring all the in-
formation that we could desire i knew
where the telegram should be sent i knew
to whom it should be directed

  i knew that lady mary whatever she

romance


the terrible island

was was not lady maty lady she might
be probably was but her real name was
alexandra and she had been named after
the highest lady in the land whose god-
daughter and maid she was

  no wonder that i had thought i remem-
bered that still self-possessed way she had
of standing with her hands before her-i
had seen its like on the platform of a
hundred public functions in england no
wonder that a likeness had haunted me
unknown to myself when i looked at our
sea maiden it is well known to certain
sets of society-of which sets i once was
an outer unconsidered member-that
those in constant and immediate contact
with the very great often acquire an amaz-
ing resemblance to them and the fea-
tures of lady mary-the very large eyes
with a beautiful fullness underneath the
oval chin the long neck and sweet close-
set mouth-were the best possible founda-
tion for such an acquired likeness to grow
upon

  what was the fascination of the sea
lady there are no words to tell but
the hearts of us poor comparatively hum-
ble men leaped their own reply

  i could not rest even with the quiet
stars to calm me i turned again and
again looked to the darkness of the cavt
with the face of rocky jim showing as
a dim white blur to the beach moon-
silvered with the wild bananas swinging
their vanes like great dark snatching
hands across orions jeweled belt and
sword

  i heard the upward crash and downward
suck of wave after wave on the island
walls outside i heard the sinister hum of
the reefs away at sea like the call of a
myriad giant hornets the moon climbed
up and up among the white stems of the
palm-trees the bell-bird ceased its
tinkling in the forest the ghost-pigeon
that wails in deep night when all true
pigeons are asleep and that lures-so
papuans say-the wanderer into dark
places of the bush and he loses sight and
dies took up its melancholy crying and
still i could not sleep

  i thought that flowers watch must be
almost over i got up and walked bare-
foot over the cold sand there was no use
lying awake like this when i could have
a companion to relieve my loneliness but
i could not see the surveyor

  i supposed he had gone up to the top
of the island to look about him and make
sure that no more trouble need be expected
from the greeks i found a quiet seat
among the rocks-my strained foot was
giving some slight trouble-and settled
myself to wait

  in a minute or two i saw him coming
up from the edge of the sea his hands
and hair were dripping he had evidently
been bathing his head to cool himself i
was about to speak to him when i caught
sight of his face in the full moonlight and
saw that upon it which closed my lips

  god tempers the wind to the shorn
lamb it was sterne who said that and
he ought to have known for with all his
genius he was weak to stand against the
winds of life

  i think god does so temper the crudest
of all winds for us who are shorn of the
strengths and splendors of other men i
suffered bitterly in ceylon when the girl
i loved with a young mans first passion
was taken from me

  i had suffered since that day when the
sea lady first stepped dripping and spar-
kling out of the ocean into our lives with
the knowledge that she was not could
never be for me but the hell that i saw
in flowers face when thinking himself
alone with the night and his agony he
looked up to the unpitying skies and
stretched his great arms abroad and beat
and wrung his hands was as far from me
as the heaven that he had hoped for was
forever out of my reach

  i felt shamed to my soul to have spied
upon his agony i knew now why he had
not spoken why he had wanted the first
watch of the night so that he might be
alone to wrestle with the blow that had
fallen on him i knew that he had never
taken the ring the sea lady wore and the
few unconscious references to cedric
very seriously that he had hoped and that
he had loved as few men in the world can
love with all the great heart and soul
enshrined in his great body

  i had in the days that passed heard
something of the history of his first mar-
riage it was a sad and a heroic tale
he had married a woman who drank the
trouble had developed during their engage-
ment and flower had insisted on carrying
out his promise in the hope of saving her

  he had not saved her after a struggle
io	beatrice

that lasted for long and bitter years she
had died-of drink-leaving him defeated
free and so weary with the fight that he
had never since her death cared to give
any woman a second glance until lady
mary came and-as he did not tell me
and as i knew-took him captive with che
first look of her innocent lovely eyes for
as long as life should last

  yes he had hoped and this was the
end no one reading that letter could
have mistaken the fact that it was written
by a lover to the woman who had given
him her promise and upon whom he relied
as he relied on god or heaven i could
not understand all of it myself but so
much was clear clear also was that
other dizzying truth that i thought flower
had not even perceived that placed our
little sea lady by right within the range
of the fierce light that beats upon a
throne

  if i had ever thought of pointing out
to him this additional barrier i lost all
idea of it now best keep the secret so
long as it could be kept there was no
good end to be served by revealing it

  the question of the moment was how
to get back to the cave without being
seen i turned cold when i thought of
flower reserved as an indian sensitive
as only a strong man is sensitive knowing
that i had watched him in his moment of
abandonment he had calmed down now
and was sitting with his head propped
upon his hand in an attitude that spoke
no more than quiet dejection

  not even his sorrow could make him
unmindful for a moment of his duty he
feat where he could overlook the whole of
the slope leading down from the summit
of the island and from time to time he
raised his head and scanned it closely

  something or other that he saw or
fancied he saw caused him by and by
to rise and walk a little forward i seized
the chance of slipping unseen into the cave
again but then or thereafter there was
little sleep that night for me

chapter x
flower plans a hunt

from the day on which we found
the letter i dated a change in flower

  up to that though he had worked hard

grmshaw

at times to supply comforts for the women
and to make our cave-home safe and
pleasant-aided by jims effective help
and my slighter assistance-he had taken
things easy when there was nothing special
to do and had loafed as big men do loaf

  they are not like us small fry who
must be always on the fidget after some-
thing or other amusement diversion the
overseeing of our neighbors business if we
happen to have none of our own

  they work more in fits and starts and
though accomplishing as much on the
whole as the restless little folk they seem
to enjoy long periods of doing nothing
at all	

  flower had taken his share of pleasant
dozing in the heat of midday under the
cool shelter of the cave of bathing in the
dawn or at sunset in the clear green waters
of the cove of lounging and smoking near
the light of our driftwood fire when all
the various tasks of day were done

  now he rested no more he amused him-
self no more like the famous statesman
whose name-i can not remember he showed
that he could toil terribly long before
jim and i had disentangled ourselves from
our bedclothes he would be out on the
beach collecting the fine white wood-ash
that was our only soap-and very good
sflap it is-running fresh water into the
breaker and scrubbing down with a whisp
of coconut fiber dressing again as much
as any of us dressed and getting away to
collect a bit more firewood for sapphira or
to fish off the outer wall of the island or
to look for wild peppers for the inevitable
stew

  he would eat hurriedly and get away
again before the rest of us had finished 
a hundred tasks he had found or made
seemed to be always waiting for him

  he had undertaken a geological survey
of the whole island and used to spend
hour after hour under the fiercest midday
suns with a smoothed-down slab of wood
and a rough charcoal pencil drawing and
making notes tapping strata with a make-
shift hammer of rock and breaking speci-
mens away peering into chasms and over
faults that showed on the high edges of
the cliffs

  he would hunt unweariedly through and
through the bush for anything animal
vegetable or mineral that might be of use
to our little community of castaways he

romance afhsssbsb
the terrible island

i

would try undaunted by failure after fail-
ure to catch some one of the greeks out-
side their fortified cave day time or night
time and make him prisoner

  if we could only get hold of one of
the brutes and make him listen to reason
he said one might arrive at some under-
standing about the ownership of the place

  but no such opportunity presented itself

  he would cut down mulberry-trees with
his knife working hard for hours to fell
ie or two of the slim trunks and rip them
open and collect the inner bark driving
jim and myself his helpers as if we were
all in danger of imprisonment or torture if
we did not produce a certain tale of work
by a certain hour

  and he got flat logs and set them out
of the sun in a cool part of the beach
and made wooden beaters and set every
one to beating tappa cloth out of the fibers
and when we were all tired or had gone
off to other jobs he would sit there still
a strange figure loose wild hair standing
up all over his head torn shirt hanging
off his neck hands each with a beater
tight held working up and down like parts
of some machine-tap-tap tap-tap till
sunset he never rested he never stopped
to yarn with any of us or to have a quiet
smoke-he smoked as he worked and
spoke only when it was necessary

  and he kept away from the sea lady

  i do not say that he avoided her when
there was a chance of doing anything for
her or for sapphira but he made no occa-
sions to seek her company he peeled
candlenut torches so that she should have
the light she fancied of nights in her sleep-
ing-cave and in silence left them where
she could find them

  he plaited her a new wide hat almost
as big as an umbrella out of palm-leaves
and handed it to her without a word leav-
ing barely time for thanks before he
turned away into the bush again

  often in the night when it was jims
watch or mine we might see flowers great
shaggy head lifted up from his bracken
bed and peering from the doorway of the
cave or one of us patrolling about the
slope might suddenly come upon him
loping down with that deerhound stride
of his from the plateau whither he had
gone to make an unexpected visit he
seemed to trust no one but himself to keep
guard over the sea lady

  jim and i talking things over agreed
that he was taking the greeks almost too
seriously after all we argued things
could not go on like this forever we
had been near three weeks on the island
and in all that time the men of the cave
had never-to our knowledge-been out in
daylight

  if they came out at night it was with
the utmost caution using the man who
could see as a sentry so that they could
get back in a hurry should any one of
us come along they would certainly get
tired of this sort of thing they would
run up some kind of flag of truce-
appeal to us in some way-try to make
terms so jim and i argued

  flower used to listen to us if he was
present in utter silence he was not much
of a talker at the best of times but this
want of responsiveness on his part had a
chilling effect

  dont you agree with us i asked him
once

  it was the time of the evening meal we
were sitting inside the cave our log stools
placed about a table that we men had man-
aged to knock up out of the natural planks
found buttressing the roots of certain great
papuan-trees

  we were careful with our ship-provisions
nowadays lemon-grass tea smoked in our
tins fish from the lagoon were served on
platters of banana-leaf white coconut
cream with red peppers cut up on it stood
in a coconut-shell at every ones elbow
to dip the morsels in since we had no
sauce

  we had a single precious biscuit apiece
and sapphira had stewed a mess of mis-
cellaneous fruits in a couple of ox-tongue
tins and served it for a sweet course de-
spite the absence of the story-book bread-
fruits and yams and oranges and bananas
which are never found on true desolate
islands we thought that ku-kus island
was doing us none too badly

  flower dipped a piece of parrot-fish in
the coconut sauce and ate it before he
made reply

  no was all he said

  why not jim and i demanded to-
gether

  because said flower setting down
his emptied tin-i knew he missed the
real tea worse than any one else in the
party but he would not touch the remain-

romance
i	beatrice

der of our little store preferring to leave
it for use in possible sickness-youve
forgotten their point of view

  they havent got any said jim
theyre half-castes-or quarter at the
best you cant reckon on them as you
would on white men

  you can reckon on human nature be
it black or white declared flower for
some time past those men have been say-
ing to one another just as we have that
this state of affairs cant continue they
probably expected their boat long ago i
dare say the blow that did for poor carl
may have accounted for her too

  well they must be beginning to see
that they are asking themselves how
is it to end and you may be sure that
they will find some answer before we shall
because if things are unpleasant for us
they are just about twice as unpleasant for
them we havent committed two murders
that would hang us at fort moresby

  we arent trying to skin the island of
its shell and shell money-which i suppose
they have hidden away before some one
else discovers it-our game is to apply
decently to the lands office for a lease
we arent shut up all day we havent so
far-gone blind any of us oh the light
end of the stick is ours without doubt
thats why i say that they will make the
first move

  what do you think it will be asked
lady mary

  the light in his eyes as he turned to
her the bitter longing beaten down by
his will as a man beats a fire back into
the ashes from which it has burst forth

  i cant tell you that he said with
the gentleness that his voice always held
when he spoke to her-which was hardly
ever now i wondered if she saw the
double meaning that i could not help read-
ing into the words

  i do not think she did sitting there
on her rough log stool her much washed
and mended cotton dress falling over her
diana-shape like the draperies of some fair
statue a blood-colored hibiscus burning
in her hair-why had she placed it there-
the sea lady i knew was thinking hardly
at all of anything flower might say she
was thinking of him looking at him won-
dering grieving over him

  did she love him then it was impos-

crimshaw

sible to tell that supreme self-control of
hers like clear ice about a flower showed
yet protected the beauty of her heart and
mind one saw-one suspected the sweet-
ness of that which lay within but one
could not touch the lovely thing the
sea ladys secrets were her own

  yet i thought that the shadow which
rested on the face of the big surveyor in
these latter days threw some portion of its
shade on her

  but he had not done speaking he held
out his tin to sapphira for more of the
lemon-grass tea swallowed it as if to clear
his voice which seemed less under control
than usual-perhaps he had caught some
cold wandering about the island-and
went on with a change of subject that
seemed curiously abrupt-

i want to do some hunting tomorrow
what are you going to hunt de-
manded sapphira alert at the mention of
anything that might concern the kitchen
pigs said flower

  we who walk somewhat apart from
the rest of humanity have strange intui-
tions at times i can not say why but
at that moment i felt an unreasoned con-
viction that flower had not changed his
subject so much after all i was sure the
pigs had something to do with it

  i thought there wasnt any objected
sapphira

  there are a very few ive found
traces lately i think we could manage
to trap some in that stretch of big scrub
why arent there more demanded
jim this ought to be a mighty good
place for them judging by other islands
i should suppose said flower choos-
ing his words with some care and look-
ing only at the piece of fish he was eat-
ing that the island for some reason
or other does not suit them

  where do you reckon they cama
from

  ku-ku probably brought them

  isnt there food for them here
  plenty

  the conversation seemed to languish
supper finished without much more talk
afterward jim went up to do sentry while
the rest of us enjoyed a quiet lounge on
the beach in the cool of the twilight

  every man has his faults and i am no
exception the worst of mine or one of

romance
the terrible island

the worst i fear is curiosity i cant
mind my own business exclusively i
must know what the rest of my immediate
world is thinking feeling fearing espe-
cially i must hunt down a secret when i
suspect one if this is a meanness it has
at all events never led me into mean
conduct i play fair i dont trap-i ask

  that night i was hot on the trail of a
mystery what had flower meant what
was the inner significance of his talk about
pigs l-knew it was waste of time for me
to question him the big man was not the
sort of person with whom one could take
a liberty-unless   

  yes that was the way if the sea lady
asked him he might or not tell but he
would not at all events be angered

  lady mary i whispered

  she turned her head in the twilight we
were sitting on the outer rim of the little
group

  can you slip aside to speak to me
i said softly something about flower

  she did not appear to hear she made
bo answer-but she rose by and by and
changed her seat we could talk now
without being overheard

  i told her in a few words that i
thought there was something behind the
hunting-plan and begged her to try and
find out she nodded and by and by
went back to her place

  mr flower i heard her say

  he started just a little as a horse starts
when a spur touches it he turned his
head to look at her he had been look-
ing darkly through the gathering dark-
ness out to the prisoning sea

  what are you going to hunt pigs for

  for you to eat he answered

  is that all

  no lady mary

  we knew now that her name was not
lady mary-but it had become a habit
to use it and she herself laid no claim

to the other it may be mine was all
we could get her to say

  am i not to know

  i would have given her all that she
asked even to the half of my kingdom
had i been a king and she a slave who
asked in such a tone flower felt it-
even more than i perhaps

  you shall know if you wish but it
might be better not to trouble you he
answered

  i think i would rather be troubled
she said

  and through that hateful clairvoyance
of mine that always told me everything
which was likely to pain me i knew she
was asking and persisting not because i
had set her on but because she wanted
to be assured that no special danger to
flower lurked in this new enterprise what-
ever it might be

  well he answered her after a pause
i can tell you what i want them for
if you wish i want them partly for food
and partly for experiments

  experiments her voice showed dis-
may almost horror you were a doctor
-do you mean-oh

  i was a medical student he corrected
and i dont mean vivisection my ex-
periments if i make any will not be in
any way troublesome to the pigs

  there was a note of finality in his voice
that seemed to tell her she had asked
enough yet she ventured one more ques-
tion

  why do you want pigs in especial
because in some ways they resemble
human beings

  she asked no more i could have put a
question or two on my own account but
lady mary once satisfied that no danger
to flower was involved left the subject
alone i do not know if further asking
would have brought further replies he
had gone very far out of his usual road
in answering even so much

stella maris of petes

by mella russell mccallum

it was a dull evening at petes res-
taurant and sailors home the me-
chanical piano was silent the scholar
was lost in a book hunched over the
oilcloth-covered table the remains of his
ham-and pushed aside his disreputable
old legs twined about those of the chair

   it was queer how the scholar never got
sick of those fool latin books youd
think old tar that he was hed be ready to
rest and smoke his brown cigarets in peace
like old jack and twist-eye over there in
the corner with their cribbage-game the
few loungers-about were apathetic and
sleepy the kid was making love to stella
that was about all the kid ever did
ashore ancf if practise makes perfect he
must have been a star in fact he was a
star for stella was past-mistress at love

   but tonight she listened to the kid with
half an ear he was a little too drunk to
appeal to her a surge of something akin
to disgust rose up in her gently lithely as
a cat she unwound herself from the arm
that enclosed her bare shoulder and be-
fore the kid knew he was being cut she
was standing some distance away patting
the red folds of her skirt over her hips
regarding him with displeasure through her
tangly lashes

   she made a pose for carmen slim
gipsyish only no carmen ever had hair
like stellas even now under her gaudy
silk head-gear it strayed about her face in
fine fair tendrils a heritage from her little
english mother who had been-according
to pete her father in an eleventh-hour
burst of confession-bonny and good

   queer words to associate with any one
connected with petes restaurant and
sailors home but then the little eng-
lish mother had died when stella was tiny
before pete gave up the sea and bought this
outrageous dump that was half-ship and
half-house and wholly disgraceful

   aw stel whats the little idea
whined the kid


stella maris

  tired goin to bed she said briefly
uncle frank will you-uncle frank

  she stamped for the scholar did not
look up

  yes stella maris what is it

  the scholar kept- one finger on the place
he was reading

  i want you to lock up early see that
jack and twist-eye dont set theirselves
afire shoo the rest out and if any ones
got to eat cook em something yourself
im goin to tell aunt cynthy to go home
for the night

  with pleasure i shall obey o stella
maris said the scholar

  stella sniffed the scholars language
was so ridiculous and why did he persist
in calling her stella maris he knew her
name was jackson hadnt old petes
name been jackson

  but aw i say stel the kid drew
himself up to a hulking handsome six feet

  stella shrugged and turned on her
wobbly french heel

  but before she reached the door there
was a desperate pounding outside

  black cynthy bounded in wringing her
hands eyes rolling

  foah gawd wese gittin raided she
moaned

  the others shuffled to their feet alert
raided your granny snapped stella
shut up cynthy dont i run a respect-
able hotel

 respectable huh how about-

  the kid was smarting

  open the door cynthy cut in stella
thatll be enough from you kid what
about the time i nursed you through
typhoid she hissed

  the kid subsided a tense voice rang
from the hall

  man most dead some one help me
bring him in

  sure stellas voice rang above old
cynthys mumbling

  she darted into the hall followed by her
guests the stranger wore a chauffeurs
livery

cynthy fresh sheets in the best
room and hustle like hell uncle frank
kid go help em in how many hurt
just mr gregory i must have drove
on to a condemned bridge

  the kid and the scholar followed the
man out into the night returning presently
with a still limp figure stella had already

of petes	

phoned for a doctor with surpiizing ten-
derness all the guests assisted in getting
the poor chap up-stairs while their pro-
prietor gave sharp orders for once aunt
cynthy had really hustled the best room
presented a fairly neat appearance

  stella opened the windows and let the
night breeze play over the still figure
then she knelt and put her ear to his heart
hes breathin she said

  the kid scowled but he went off
down-stairs with the rest at her bidding

  when the doctor arrived there was a
fresh fever of activity his diagnosis was
not long forthcoming

  half his bones are broken ill get an-
other surgeon and well find out how bad
he is internally can he stay here

  he looked hard at stella

  are you the landlady because it
would probably mean death to move him
while here-theres  chance

  of course he can stay snapped stella
what do you think i am a heartless
vamp

  thats fine thank you he said now
the first thing is a nurse its twenty miles

to a hospital-

  does she have to be a trained nurse
stella breathed fast i know a peach of a
practical nurse

  you do well get her right away
then shell do till we can find better
wheres the telephone ill call dr seager
stella pointed to the booth then flew
into the deserted dining-room beckoning
to the kid and the scholar her eyes were
shining oddly

  see here you

  she shut the door and talked low

im goin to be the nurse myself and
you sports aint goin to give me away
they stared in amazement then the
scholar quick to divine motives nodded-
far be it from me to give you away
stella maris

  but the kid remarked-

  helluva lot that docll let you nurse a
patient o hisn

  he wont know its me just wait till
i come down-stairs-you wont know me
yourself but you got to promise you
wont squeal kid

  she drew tantalizingly near him and
when he caught her and held her close she
did not struggle

  you beauty you little devil 
mella russell mccallum

  the kid was himself again

  promise me she whispered

  aw why dya wanta pull off a fool
stunt like that girlo when me and yous

so happy-

  kid i pulled you through typhoid
please- she kissed him

  aw well go to it then only just give
me a chance when its over

stella sped up to her room casting off
her gipsyish attire as she went first
she scrubbed her face scrubbed off the
rouge and the too-black brows then she
let down her pale fine hair and combed it
up again into a plain loose twist rum-
maging through a trunk she brought up a
wrinkled but clean blue gingham house-
dress and from somewhere unearthed a
white apron

  she hardly knew herself when she was
done the mirror reflected a pale rather
delicately pretty girl with a wealth of fair
hair and brown eyes behind tangly lashes

  gawd wonder what peted say she
muttered

  it was her own father who had taught
her the manners and morals of a gipsy

  she ran down-stairs the kid and the
scholar gasped the scholar bowed

  stella maris he said admiringly
now you are like your mother

  but the kid scratched his head

  you look so damned-so damned-

  respectable she supplied laughing
sure i do and i am time bein now
uncle frank you and mell sneak out back
and around front

  she snatched aunt cynthys dark shawi
and wrapped it round her

  you can interdooce me as miss stella
maris from a neiborin farm

  the doctor never guessed he was re-
lieved with a curt nod he told her what
to do in half an hour the other doctor
came things hummed in the sick-room

  and thus began a new strange chapter
in the life of old pete jacksons stella

  of course if she hadnt had a natural
knack for nursing she never could have
gotten away with it but ever since she
was a child she had loved to take care of
the sick it was the one useful thing on
earth she did love many an old seafarer
she had nursed back to health-and young
ones too who never forgot her

  as for her guests giving her away she

had no fear she had a reputation for fair
play herself and they would do the same
by her in this her latest whim aunt
cynthy could see to the cooking and the
scholar could look after things generally
the scholar never paid any board anyway
so she could ask him she kept him on be-
cause he had known her mother

  when a girl has had a good bringing-up
it is her own fault if she is not a credit to
it but when a girl has had no bringing-up
-who can say

  stella did not know what respectability
was except as something to be scoffed at
she had put rouge on her face since she
could remember pete had showed her how
to apply it he had also taught her that
her surest asset-surer than the uncertain
receipts of the hotel-was her slim beauty
and she had been an apt pupil she had
earned an unsavory reputation at a tender
age and always managed to live up to it
her house while keeping the letter of the
law was avoided by all who valued their
good name

  what charm therefore could there be
for her in playing the dull role of nurse
why the charm of the unknown

all her crowded young life she had
wondered what it would be like not
to be shunned as old petes girl she had
at infrequent intervals longed for quiet un-
troubled waters for humdrum respectabil-
ity her friends were so unrestful with
their ready fists and passions she had
actually craved drudgery

  and now she was to have it and in her
own house too already she was enjoying
herself she liked the homely laborious
tasks the doctors gave her and she found
herself interested in the fate of the poor
smashed-up young man

  the next day the first doctor mentioned
the landlady to her

where is that young heathen that was
ordering every one around here last night
oh she goes and comes evaded stella
i guess she dont look after her business
apparently not

  he lowered his tone

  this is a tough joint i hear he con-
fided

  she jumped it sounded so funny

  is it she asked i aint seen nothin
out o the way

  oh you wouldnt he answered
stella maris- of petes



  was that a compliment she thought it
must be

  of course it is doubtful if the charm of
the humdrum would have lasted in other
circumstances if the patient had been
wholly charmless himself for instance

  but as soon as the doctors agreed that he
would pull through her interest in him
became something other than that of nurse
for he was like a young chiseled god she
thought he reminded her of the statues
the scholar had taken her to see in the
classical museum once fair regular fea-
tures fair crisp curling hair long gold
lashes she wondered about his eyes he
hadnt opened them yet

  and who was he his clothes spelled
money the chauffeur had said he was
taking mr gregory back to school she
had meant to ask that chauffeur a lot of
things but he had hurried away to notify
the guardian he said

she expected the young mans relatives
would show up soon they must feel
terrible about him

  but nobody came except the chauffeur
again with a roll of bills that would have
given pete apoplexy and the message that
mr gregorys guardian mr estis was
greatly distressed over the accident and
would be out to see him just as soon as he
could spare the time

  stella was highly indignant at that mes-
sage and told the chauffeur so but he
merely shrugged like the well-trained ser-
vant he was

  then on the third day the young man
opened his eyes stella nearly dropped the
bottle she was carrying for his eyes were
the clearest gray she ever saw

  you look like an english girl was his
first remark

  she shook her head she couldnt speak
at last she managed-

  my mother was english

  i knew it but tell me about myself
what happened dick started to cross a
bridge i remember and we went through
on some rocks

  she recounted the story

  where am i now

  at a road-house four miles from fair-
ville twenty miles from the city the
proprietor took you in

  say thank him for me will you
  its a lady but shes gone away now

  how interesting youre from some
hospital i suppose

  no i just live near they sent for me
i aint a real nurse but both the doctors
say im doin all right

  i should say you were he said con-
tentedly attempting to stretch out an arm
ouch he winced i am smashed up
before the day was done she had
gathered his history he had no family
he was responsible to his guardian mr
estis of a well known legal firm but in a
few months he would be twenty-one and
then he would have control of his own
affairs he would probably go into his
guardians office but then again maybe
he wouldnt he might strike out for him-
self from the nonchalant way he spoke
of money she knew he had plenty why
the roll under his pillow would choke aunt
cynthys cow

  young bones knit quickly especially if
the will helps and gregory allison was
a model patient he obeyed the doctor and
he obeyed the nurse if they told him to
grin and bear it he grinned and bore it
if they told him to shut his eyes and try to
sleep he shut his eyes and tried to sleep

  but its hard not to be able to talk to
you all i want to he told stella the next
day ive never known a girl like you
i want to get better acquainted

	stella flushed there was no rouge to
hide it and the young man saw a sym-
pathetic tint stole faintly into his cheeks

  i aint a educated girl said stella
rubbish any one can get an educa-
tion but any one cant get what youve
got

  what

  why character you know

  verily it was more than a new chapter
in life it was a new life

  most of the girls i know are so useless
he went on they couldnt roll bandages
like youre doing now nice little things
you know but-well i shant ever be in-
terested in them again

  why not

  stella turned away to hide her face
oh i shant thats all say miss
maris whats your first name

  stella

  how beautiful stella maris you
were named that on purpose i know
no i guess not she said uneasily it
just happened
mella russell mccallum

    he shook his head

    no such things dont just happen

    i think youd better try to go to sleep
    all right-stella

    he smiled up at her her heart pounded

 the role of respectability wasnt so mo-
 notonous after all

    to do them justicestellas guests were
 loyal to her even the kid-although the
 kid went away on a short cruise a few days
 after the accident so his loyalty wasnt so
 remarkable they went about their bus-
 iness as usual-if pipes and mugs and crib-
 bage and seven-up are business

    stella gave her household orders secretly
 at night aunt cynthy ministered to their
 needs and the faithful scholar kept his eye
 peeled off and on-when ovid wasnt too
 engrossing they regarded stellas adven-
 ture in respectability as a great joke and
 called her miss maris to her face without
 winking but privately they thought she
 was crazy to drudge that way

   a week passed two weeks

    he can be taken to a hospital safely
 now the doctors agreed speaking to
 stella

    i dont care to go announced gregory
    they had thought he was asleep

    but it may be inconvenient for the-er
 -management of this place to keep you
 suggested the first doctor

    i think i can find out about that
 offered stella

    so the next day she told him she had
 talked with the landlady and that every-
 thing was all right the young man could
 stay as long as he liked at the regular rates
 of course young allison stayed

  and of course he fell in love with stella
  she cried when he told her

 what makes you do that he de-
 manded in some awe

  i cant help it mr allison

 gregory you mean

 gregory i mean

 you arent unhappy are you stella
 im so happy-im-but i think youd
 better go to sleep now

  i will if youll kiss me

 stella hesitated she was two years his
 senior but she was centuries older than this
 boy fresh from his tutors and guardians
 why he had even admitted that this was
 the first time in all his life he had not been
 under some sort of guardianship

  but the blood surged hot within her
breast she had a right to happiness she
argued most men werent worth kissing
but gregory she had a right to take the
love he offered

   no matter what she had been she loved
 him and she was his now she was good
 now loving him made her so the past
 didnt count old pete didnt count or
 any of her lovers-the kid-

   she leaned over and met his lips lightly

   now sleep dear she said

   he closed his eyes still smiling

  as the days went on she ceased to
struggle with herself she listened to him
and they laughed together and just drifted
he suffered very little pain now the
danger of internal injury was past she
neglected to give cynthy orders and went
about in a haze of happiness the first real
happiness she had ever known happiness
that she had not believed possible

   but all drifting craft must pull up some-
 where a month six weeks passed
 gregory allison recovered he sat up now
 and even walked about with a crutch

   one day the chauffeur came to take him
 home he said that the guardian was
 highly gratified at his wards recuperation

   stella went about the task of packing his
 things with a leaden weight in her breast

   he watched her as she worked he was
sitting in an old rocker with a steamer-rug
across his knees

   hang it all  he burst out you know
 how i hate to go dont you stella

   she faced him miserably

  do you spose-ill ever see you
again she whispered

   the possibility had never occurred to
her in her experience men came and went
bees about a flower and the flower had
never cared-till now

   why darling girl what ever put such
an idea in your head

   he held out his arms she flew to him
 flinging herself beside him on her knees

   you know ill be of age in just a short
 time and then theres no reason why we
 cant be married is there

   she pushed him back a little staring at
 him marriage she had never dreamed
 of it

  she could have laughed how easy
everything was her fears for nothing
why it was too simple she could simply
leave the old life forever like a soiled dis-
stella maris of petes

carded garment they would never find
her or if they did they would be loyal
she had been fair to them always even
the kid wouldnt spoil the game hed
play fair

  gregory pulled her back to him jealously
it wont be long dear just a few
weeks oh stella youre so-so-all i
can think of is bonny youre so bonny
she thought suddenly of petes dying
confidences pete had said her mother was
bonny-bonny and good

  bonny and good somehow the words
seemed to belong together now gregory
was bonny and good but she no matter

how bonny she might be-

  stella your hands are cold-you
frighten me

- no no gregory

  you love me dont you

  the voice of conscience was a thing to
be laughed at along with all decency yet
it tortured old petes stella now perhaps
it was the little english mother speaking
within her she thought of her childhood
dancing in a little red skirt for her fathers
guests kissing their rough faces when they
tossed her in the air

  gregory allison had told her about his
childhood spent first with a governess who
had implanted ideals of manhood and
womanhood in him that he had never for-
gotten-would never forget later with a
favorite tutor who had taught him all the
healthful sports with the underlying idea
that the body must be slave to the soul

but she loved him so why did these
scenes persist to torment her
gregory would never know anything of her
life she would be his slave the old days
would be wiped away she had a right to
happiness  old pete had come near to
cheating her out of it but he shouldnt-
he shouldnt she had the right-and she
would take it-and marry gregory-and
be happy happy happy

  the boy was terribly alarmed at her long
silence

  stella you must tell me whats the
matter dont you- he choked-dont
you love me enough to want to marry me
dont lie to me-because i cant iet you
marry me out of pity dear

pity she could have screamed at that
it was supper-time down-stairs she
knew it by the smell of aunt cynthys fried

potatoes wafted up to them pretty soon
the scholar and twist-eye and jack and
the rest would range themselves about the
oilcloth-covered table

  the kid might come in tonight too he
was due there would be remarks passed
about gregorys departure they would
express relief that stella would be back
soon

  but she would not be back she was
planning swiftly she would go that very
night to the city to some quiet place and
wait till she and gregory could marry
and then-

  why after that they would be happy
she would adore him always and give him
her best

  for gregory deserved not her best but
the best on earth-the bonny and good
she couldnt cheat gregory she had never
cheated any one

  oh holy mother she prayed for the
first time in her life pete wins

  stella cried gregory frantically

  i-guess i-made a mistake she said
hurriedly i-thought i cared-enough
-but-i guess i dont

  his arms relaxed tightened dropped re-
turned he pleaded

  she got up and went on packing his
things

  half an hour later an auto glided off up
the road away from petes restaurant and
sailors home

  stella lay on her bed for several hours
then toward midnight she got up calmly
and put on her gipsyish clothes the reg-
ulars below were dozing but they perked
up joyously at sight of her

  gosh stel we was fraid the rich kidd
want you to run away with him or some-
thing chuckled old jack

  stella slumped down in her chair and
crossed her red silken anklescomplacenlly
as she lighted a cigaret

  he did she said

  then whynell didnt you

  this from the kid

  you could of got a nice wad and then
shipped him and beat it back to me-eh
girlo what was the matter with your
brains on a vacation

  oh hell you wouldnt understand
said stella

  but the scholar straightened his old back
and smiled across the top of his book

  stella maris he said softly

romance -
dynamite has its advantages

by dale brown

  if you have not felt the charm of dag-
  gett bowl that long oval valley se-
  questered by pine-covered hills literally
  infested with twittering rcdbills
  pounding woodpeckers and rasping blue-
  jays if you have not seen the flood of
  violets sweeping up to meet the conifers if
  you know nothing of the cinnamon smell of
  the hills-you wont understand why nell
  daggett was in such an ugly mood that old
  simmy stuck to his kitchen till she was
  out of sight

    simmy himself-bow-legged water-eyed
  leather-skinned-was somewhat uncertain
  of temper and afraid of no one but when
  nell ordinarily a sweet-dispositioned alto-
  gether lovable young woman so far forgot
  her seminary english as to call him a
  quartz-headed clatter-mouthed old rooster
  simmy knew that it was wise to stay in the
  kitchen

     that kitchen had been his sacred prov-
  ince since the day some twenty years be-
  fore when pop daggett nells father or-
  dered him to transfer his activities from
  the chuck-wagon over which he presided
  to the new culinary realm and even nell
  respected it

    the fact of the matter was that nell
  born on that very ranch was afraid that
  she would be compelled to leave it and
  teach school or some such thing and she
  did not want to she wanted to stay there
  and regain possession of the place which
  she had been obliged to sell to an aged
  easterner named gorman two notes
  which pop had neglected to mention be-
  fore he died and drouth and a scourge had
  been responsible for that and gorman
   summering at the ranch had offered a price
  and agreed to retain nell as manager
  having no alternative she accepted the
  offer

    gorman had tried nearly everything and
  felt that he might as well round out his
  financial gambling-career with sheep as
  with anything else


dynamite has its advantages

  but you make it pay me he had said
or some one is going to buy a ranch real
cheap ill give it one fling

  he did not know that nells heart was
broken over the sale of the place she kept
that side well hidden but he did know
that he had agreed to sell back to her after
a period of years at the price he paid gor-
man expected to be dead by then so he
couldnt lose anything-if nell made it
profitable in the meantime

  and that was the trouble it was not
profitable a well-planned campaign of
depredation-mysterious costly accidents
-seemed to be underway to force the sale
of the ranch and not a clew to the author
had developed gorman threatened to ac-
cept one of several offers nell did not want
him to do so-and as a consequence simmy
found it wise to stay in seclusion

  nell crossed kitter creek rushing down
from old saddleback at the foot of which
snuggled the ranch-buildings and came
into the south pasture where joe was re-
pairing a fence

broken she asked sliding from perk
nope cut said joe a tall angular-
somber-visaged man in the middle thirties

  he pointed to a huddle of fleecy bodies
fifty feet below and nell half-wished that
she were a man so that she might at least
swear satisfyingly

  i met frank lester a while ago she
said he repeated his offer for the place
and i told him i had advised gorman to
hang on-that we were living in hopes of
getting to the bottom of it i hate to think

frank would-

  joe straightened up glanced at her and
then at a huge flock-frank lesters-
grazing around the rim of daggett bowl
frank ran sheep on three sides of daggetts
and lived up a coulee between twin hills
on the east said joe

  frank wants it he needs it he could
use this water i reckon and the ranch-

house and-

  oh i know but so do you want it-
and so do i we have just as much reason
thats foolish

  mebbe so

  joe was inclined to sullenness at times
and he was stubborn-a rather morose in-
dividual

  mebbe so but just the same some-
bodys doin it and    say nell you
aint tryin to say you or me-



sure thats just what im trying to

say

  nell could be sarcastic upon occasion

  any one would imagine to look at you
that you had a little-a very little intelli-
gence now forget about frank i heard
from gormans lawyers today and what do
you think they said the boss is coming
out himself

  n-o-o

  y-e-e-s and im to hold the fort till
he gets here i dont see how he can learn
anything if we cant they didnt say
when but they said he was going to in-
vestigate personally sounds as if he
thought  was doing it-deliberately and
whoever is wont while hes around will
they

  having thus worked herself into a fine
rage she caught up perk and astonished
that little horse immensely by digging her
heels into his flanks joe stared after her
a rather ugly frown on his homely face

two days later simmy sunning him-
self on the corral-fence stared incred-
ulously at the occupants of an approaching
buckboard and waddled into the house with
his news

fred moores cornin he announced

  all right

nell busy at her desk did not look up

  yeah-but that aint all

  she sighed and swung about she knew
simmy

  hes got his buckboard an that team o
sorrels he got off o frank lester hes
coinin hell-bent must be dang near here
by now i reckon

  he waddled to the window and peered
out

  yep there he is and say nell y
ought t see that there fellah with him-
dangdest lookin fellah ever  see now im
tellin yuh 

  nell frowned another vacationist
probably-and she didnt want vacationists
pestering around she wouldnt have them
they were a nuisance at any time but just
now   

  nevertheless she went out to meet the
stranger a short slender good-looking
young man attired in startling checks and
smiling she tried to be irritated by the
smile and the checks and the young mans
assured attitude-and failed miserably

youre miss daggett he inquired

              romance -
dale brown

im jerry malone freddie out there
said he thought youd take care of me im
trouper-circus-performer you know
and ive been dreaming of a vacation like
this for years-honest 

  nell could not restrain a smile he was
such a clean-looking boy and so eager
but she refused to commit herself at once
merely urged fred and malone to stay to
dinner and talk it over

  in the afternoon however despite nells
resolution to forswear vacationists fred
drove back alone to lemm and malone
from choice took up his quarters with joe
in the old bunk-house-a bit of diplomacy
laving no little impression upon the dag-
gtt forces

  malone was a likable chap on the third
day by the gift of a slightly out-of-date
alarmingly checked suit he completely won
simmy it was difficult to tell what joe
thought of him but nell seemed to lose
some of her pessimism

  jerry was a new sort of human being
you could not be blue and out of sorts
when he was around perhaps his indif-
ference to feminine charm had something
to do with nells interest he accepted
her in much the same spirit as he accepted
simmy as if she were a rather good sort-
good enough to pal with for a few weeks
anyway and this piqued her

  she knew that as a mere woman she
was attractive and she wondered if it were
possible that jerry did not know it if so
shed see that he learned it

  it was on the fourth day that jerry wan-
dered away alone in his pocket a lunch
wheedled from simmy he climbed old
saddleback swung around the eastern hills
and in the late afternoon came out at the
lower end of the valley crossing the rim
he lay down within the daggett borders
feasting his eyes on the glory of the west-
ern ridge and there nell found him and
slid from her horse

  pretty isnt it she asked

  pretty ive never seen anything like
it

  he pointed to lesters flocks

  whose sheep are those

  frank lesters he has the rim on
three sides of us

  oh-then you own just this strip
through the center got the best of it at
that havent you

  yes that is mr gorman has he

owns this-i dont i had to sell two
years ago and he was here from the east
and bought it

  had to sell doesnt it pay

  it did pay-but i had a run of bad

luck it would pay now if-

  if what

  nell looked at him sharply wishing she
might read what was beneath his smiling
exterior

  i dont know why you shouldnt know-
you or any one else she said and went on
to tell of her trouble

  jerry was silent for a time after she fin-
ished

  looks like lester doesnt it he finally
asked you and he are about the only
two people who could be interested and i

dont suppose youd-

  oh yes i would she interrupted bit-
ingly id kill sheep and cut fences and
poison stock and all such things id love
to do it you see i was born here and i
hate awfully to give it up

  outwardly she was a very sweet at-
tractive young woman and she smiled at
him with very red lips and very dark eyes
and told herself that she hated him and
how dare he say such a thing or even think
it it wasnt any of his concern anyhow
and shed see to it that he left the ranch-
left that very night

  no she wouldnt either shed see to it
that he stayed there until she finished with
him she would make him fairly grovel
and then she would laugh at him-cruelly

  as i was about to say- jerry ap-
parently unperturbed broke in on her
thoughts-i dont suppose youd dare ac-
cuse frank without some scrap of proof
would you we might have him pinched
on suspicion

  nells reply was a glance which should
have seared his very soul but seemed to
fail of its purpose he continued to grin
   and he had dared lead her into the
trap-deliberately she bit her lip and
felt sure that her temples were redder than
they should be and she mounted perk
and rode recklessly away

jerry watched her quite aware of her
appeal and a bit disturbed by it he
lay on his back gazing across the bowl
and finally fell asleep to be awakened by a
drop of rain

  it was quite dark and the drop was

forerunner of a perfect deluge he crawled
hurriedly beneath a clump of brush and
had been there but a short time when his
ears caught the low bleating of sheep and
a light dull rumble skidding along the
ground a moment and the rumble and
bleat increased as if a flock were being
driven toward him at break-neck speed

  peering forth he saw a dark mass spring
from the murk and rush toward the fence
shutting off that fifty-foot declivity to the
rim it was over in a moment the lead-
ers halted a second at the edge there was a
creaking as the fence went down the flash
of shadowy bodies

  jerry could not see but he could hear the
horror of the thing-and he shuddered and
crept from his shelter unmindful of the
rain

  far across the bowl glimmered the ranch-
house lights guiding him through thick
coarse grasses across a bare field a
meadow a horse-pasture and into a lane
leading to the bunk-house

  and there he met a huge figure in slicker
and boots which proved to be joe almost
breathlessly jerry told the story as they
hastened toward the house

  it was awful joe he added my
lord how can a man do a thing like that
joe made no reply merely cursed be-
neath his breath-and a peculiar thought
flashed into jerrys mind what was joe
doing in the lane at that hour of course
he might have business there then again
he might not jerry wanted to inquire into
that but some instinct halted him how-
ever he thought about -it long after he
crawled into bed

  in the morning nell half-distracted by
the outrage-the first since jerrys advent
-temporarily shelved her grievance against
him and when he suggested a visit to
frank lester just to feel him out she
rather reluctantly consented

  they met lester coming from his ranch-
house and nell introduced the men frank
was perhaps forty big and hearty-but
according to jerrys mental cataloguing
slippery

  come up out of the sun he urged
and on the porch comfortable in easy
chairs whats on your mind nell
face to face with opportunity she hesi-
tated and glanced helplessly at malone
whose countenance remained as expression-

less as a blank wall nell entered another
score against him in her black book

  why in the world had he wanted to come
if not to talk-to help her she hadnt
suggested it hadnt seen the object in such
a visit floundering helplessly she grasped
at the first straw which offered

  frank she said im at my wits end
and i need advice you know how things
have been going at my place and last night
   well it was worse than ever and no
one at home seems to have intelligence
enough even to guess at it

  she smiled sweetly at frank looked pity-
ingly at jerry-and immediately began to
feel better at least that opportunity had
not been neglected

  lester sat staring down the coulee puff-
ing thoughtfully at a huge brier

  dont believe i can help you he said
at length i reckon i know what youre
trying to get at nell you and i are about
the only folks who have a reason-and you
aint doing it well my word wouldnt be
worth much under the circumstances would
it one thing i can do-i withdraw my
offer that makes it look better for me
anyhow

  riding towad home nell was inclined
to feel that frank had exonerated himself
until jerry grinned at her and said

  clever stroke all right but it doesnt
mean anything easy enough to make it
again when the times ripe and it puts a
stopper on your suspicions right now yes
id done that myself

  nells spirits dropped to zero she knew 
that jerry was right

  im going to write gormans lawyers
again tonight she said desperately im
through i havent a chance to get the
place back and-and-oh i dont want to
stay another minute without that hope

i can teach-or something if only gor-
man would accept joes offer-

  joes offer

  yes joe has raked and scraped-but
it isnt enough by a good deal joe loves
it as well as i do he came in with dad
when he was a mere kid and i wouldnt
so much mind his having it gormans
lawyers said that the boss was coining out
soon i wish he would im-oh you
cant imagine how i hate to give this up
jerry said nothing for a minute or so
he looked off toward the ranch-buildings
then at nell and finally said

  and if joe got it-you could marry
him couldnt you that would be one
way to solve the thing

  nell nearly fell from perk never in her
life had she known any one with a better
developed faculty for saying the wrong
thing at the wrong time either that or
he was deliberately baiting her at the
thought her teeth clicked audibly shed
give him something to think about anyway

  i dont know a better man she said
defiantly and i hate to give up the place
i suppose youre thinking of the thing
called love-whatever it is well if joe

asks me-

  her chin was outthrust her eyes blazed
and when jerry merely grinned in that in-
timate teasing way she wanted to choke
him said jerry indifferently

  go as far as you like i dont blame
you a bit nope i wasnt thinking of
love im just as selfish as you are if
i loved a woman to death i wouldnt marry
her-unless she was a trouper i wouldnt
give that up for the best woman on earth

it was not what she expected or wanted
him to say and it irritated her so that
for two days she avoided him and made life
almost unbearable for simmy simmys
disillusionment was heart-rending for all
his years he did not suspect that even the
sweetest of women is mortal-under suffi-
cient provocation

  with the passing of another week nell
and jerry not only regained the old footing
but attained an intimacy causing simmy to
squint his old eyes after them and at the
end of that week came a letter from gor-
mans lavvyers regretting nells resignation
and asking that she remain in charge till
the owner might be communicated with f
they-had no instructions other than the
injunction to entertain no offer for the
ranch till the owner could personally in-
vestigate and when that would be they
were not at liberty to state under the
circumstances nell had no choice feeling
however a bit resentful at what she was
pleased to term the imposition of gor-
man

  it isnt fair she complained to jerry
he cant expect me to take more interest
than he does can he ive made up my
mind i want to get away

  and hunt up a school

  yes if i have to she flashed the

longer i stay here the harder it will be to

leave

  jerrys grin was maddening

  cheer up he advised calmly maybe

hell sell to joe yet and then you can-

  if you say it ill-jerry youre a mis-
erable little brute

  and then earnestly

  you shouldnt joke about that i dont
even know that joe would-would ask me
im not joking ill make him per-
sisted malone or else-well weve got
to take care of you some way havent we
if worst comes to worst i might kidnap
you take you back on the show with me
never id rather be an old wrinkly
schoolmaam-than prance about the coun-
try that way

  i know but-why i couldnt stand

this youd learn to like it-

   i dont think id fret about it if i were
you she put in cuttingly it isnt likely
well have to face that problem

  im not so sure

  the good-natured banter had gone from
his voice and he was staring at her pe-
culiarly

  sometimes i think-

  what he thought she never knew for joe
came up and put an end to the passage and
she went to the house in a decidedly puzzled
frame of mind she told herself that she
did not like jerry that she would not
marry him if he was the last man on earth

  being a poor liar however she could
not make it sound convincing-not even to
herself and because she was sound at
bed-rock she did a good deal of thinking
about it

  perhaps simmys vision was clearer than
any he chuckled and confided to joe
danged if they aint in a slippery posi-
tion walkin a rail thataway one leetle
shove one way or tother an off they go-
an theyll alius be wonderin where theyd
a lit if theyd been pushed the other way
nope i aint bettin a dang nickel on it

came a night when jerry wakened by
sorjie one moving cautiously about the
bunk-house caught a gleam of light as the
door was opened and closed softly he sat
up every faculty alert uncertain how to
proceed finally throwing back the covers
and slipping to the floor

  a light step without caused him to spring
back into the bunk the door again


dynamite has its advantages

opened softly some one entered and a mo-
ment later a board creaked in joes corner
jerry lay down listening and finally fell
asleep

  in the morning he mentioned the inci-
dent

  i got up to look about once joe said
quietly thought i heard some one
prowlin round

  immediately after breakfast nell sug-
gested a climb up old saddleback and
jerry agreed eagerly half-way up they
halted beside kitter creek jerry reveling
in the view down the valley

  lord its wonderful he said rever-
ently and the birds-the silence of these
woods-the song of old kitter here i
dont wonder that you want it back

  my dad found it said nell dreamily
sometimes i think ill-ill die when i
have to leave it lets not talk about it
lets cross the creek here we can ford it
on the rocks

  jerry led the way turning to grin back
at her

  spike your foot into them he cau-
tioned theyre slippery

  and then it happened somehow nells
foot slipped she struggled for balance-
and fell forward into jerrys arms

  later neither could recall just what hap-
pened only a vivid remembrance of a mo-
ment in which they clung together lips
meeting hearts pounding with the rush of
youthful blood

  and then they were upon the bank nell
weak nerveless trembling throughout the
length of her jerry standing humbly head
bowed face white-as if he had done a
fearful thing for which he was willing to
pay

  she faced him a moment then turned
away to lookdown the valley and her
glance went to the tank near the sheep-
sheds from which a colt was wobbling its
crazy way

  look jerry she gasped that
colt-

  he looked in time to see the colt sway
dizzily stumble and fall and together
they hurried down old saddleback arriving
in the corral as joe stepped back from the
colt

  poisoned explained joe thought
i heard some one in the night wonder
where the mare is lucky them hosses
was out in pasture

  without a word nell turned toward the
house and joe and jerry rounding the
horse-barn found the mare-dead

  and now what inquired jerry as
they went back to the tank

  joe spread his hands and swore

  all right said jerry significantly
think of something by tomorrow-or i il
horn in on this thing myself theres been
about enough of it looks almighty queer
to a man up a tree

  he left joe staring wonderingly after
him and he spent the rest of the day
studiously avoiding nell-an unnecessary
precaution for she kept religiously to the
house the mind of neither was on the
poisoned tank but the incident on saddle-
back which somehow seemed of more vital
import as for jerry he gloried in the
recollection while fjell-well one moment
she did-and the next she did not

  far into that night jerry lay sleepless
and again joe cautiously left his bunk and
crept from the house jerry slipped to the
door opened it just wide enough to peer
out and discerned joes figure melting into
the blackness of the shearing-pens hur-
riedly drawing on shirt and trousers he
followed and as he rounded the horse-barn
he saw a figure stooping above a little
flame which suddenly sputtered into life
and began creeping along the ground to-
ward the water-tank

  despite the fact that he had been sus-
picious of joe jerry gasped at the audacity
of the thing he saw and started on a run
for that little line of fire as the figure above
it straightened and came toward him he
was small perhaps but not for nothing had
he battered his way through a rather rough
old world and he clenched his fists and
prepared either to take or give a drubbing

  but just then another figure sprang
from the shearing-pen blackness and
tackled the one that had lighted the fuse

  jerry gasped again and stopped to stare
forgetting the imminent explosion he saw
the two men come together heard a curse
-and thai one of the men shot violently
backward and fell to the ground

  he did not get up so again jerry broke
into a run and when sufficiently near at-
tempted a flying tackle which coming
unexpectedly was rather effective his
bulky opponent was knocked from his feet
his curse smothered by a mouthful of dirt

jerry grinned to himself scrambled up

look a quick look at his victim for identin-
cation-purposes and was about to start for
the fuse when the explosion came there
was a deafening roar a blinding flash-and
when he got to his feet lights had sprung
up in the ranch-house

  he staggered to the huge bulk he had
successfully tripped it was quiet sprawled
grotesquely where a plank from the de-
molished tank had downed it huge drops
of water falling caused jerry to look up
then he remembered

he dropped to his knees beside the
still form joined a moment later by
nell and old simmy arid joe who had re-
covered from his knockout and appeared
rather groggy the corral was a lake

  turn him on his back commanded
nell and gasped when she saw the face
frank lester she choked i-oh
she shoved jerry away dropped down
and tore open franks shirt

  its beating get hold boys lets get
him into the house-quick

  that in itself was some task but ac-
complished proved frank not seriously
hurt a discoloration between the shoul-
der-blades marked where the plank had
struck nell faced jerry and joe

  i been sleepin with one eye open ex-
plained joe heard some one last night
but couldnt find nobody when i got out
then tonight-well there you are

  frank hit me first thats all and if it
hadnt been for jerry there you might still
be thinkin it was me i suppose you
been thinkin it long enough-all of yuh
i aint blind mebbe i can get a little joy
outta life now

  then he clumped away and nell looked
at jerry and jerry looked at nell and both
smiled and glared at old simmy who
growled and went back- to his bunk in the
shed behind the kitchen jerry nodded to-
ward the still form on the lounge

  what about him hes apt to come
around any minute better have joe stay
with him till we see how hes going to take
it hadnt you ill ask simmy to get to
town after the sheriff

  nell had not been thinking of such mat-
ters but she nodded and went to the bunk-
house and jerry followed simmy into the
shed

  later they met again this time on the

porch simmy was on his way to town
and joe was in the room with the still un-
conscious lester light was break-
ing over the hills to the east said jerry-
well your problem seems to be settled
at last the boss cant help giving you
another whirl at it after this in time i
suppose youll have it back

  nell did not seem very enthusiastic
perhaps she agreed absently youre
-what are you going to do

  me oh my times about up ive got
to go back i suppose the white tops-
well they pull nell

  i suppose they do jerry when-
when are you going

  nell lets drop it im going-how
soon can you get ready

  and if i wont

  she was still a bit defiant

  jerry slid one arm about her shoulders
he was still grinning but his tone was
earnestly dolorous when he said-

  then-well itll smash me-thats all
nell tried to restrain the smile to force
him to grovel-but failed

  ill go she said simply somehow
its all very clear this morning it isnt a
question of where is it its just a ques-
tion of who ill be happy anywhere
jerry drew her to a seat on the porch
step the grin disappearing as if by magic

  lets do he urged earnestly queer
but ive changed too somehow id rather
play nursemaid to the sheep

  thats what you get for falling in love
i suppose it makes you want todo what
you know well you dont want to do 
he was silent a moment then went on
ive been cheating you anyway and i
think i want to stay-sort of an enjoyable
punishment you see nell gorman was
my uncle and when he died a few weeks
ago i was the only one left so i got it all
i thought id learn more out here if you
didnt know that and i told the lawyers to
stall you along if frank had known i
owned this place-

they were still on the porch when
simmy and the sheriff drove up and
simmys face took on a look of satisfaction

  after all he announced as he led the
way to the back door they wasnt shoved
off o that rail they was literlly blowed
off dynamites got its advantages

horse through the wild lands
lying behind scarborough in

at these moments slowed down and occa-

wynne came to himself once more rated

  they came to a fair place presently
where a stream of pure bright water wound
through the woods and flashed like silver
through the gorgeous colors of a tropical
wilderness great trees decked with veils
of lichens and adorned with white orchid-
blossoms hung over the rivulet anthu-
riums vast-leaved philodendra ferns and
trailing parasites innumerable covered the
banks with a tangle of lush life and upon
many a bough and branch where their fly-

dog-pines in sprightly companies

and sugar-birds bluebirds and humming-

another sort of volcanic boulder took the

merrily along with whirls and eddies with
flashing falls and still placid reaches that

were tree-ferns and stephanotis

  vveston wynne was come to the west
indies on a sad errand roland wynne
his father overseer of the fort king george
sugar factory had suddenly disappeared
from his home that accidental death had
overtaken him appeared certain for ample
evidences of the fact were recorded all
particulars reached the son of the dead by
letter and since the vanished man had
many interests in tobago and the lawyers
seemed unwilling to wind up his affairs
weston wynne a partner in a london-
stockbroking firm obtained permission to
go abroad and settle matters on the spot

  a sum of ten thousand pounds was in-
volved and he alone had interest in the
estate for his mother was long dead and
he had no near kindred the young man
hardly knew his father for he had been sent
home soon after his third year and with
the exception of a visit to tobago when he
left school at fifteen years old and before
he went into an office he had never seen
him that was twelve years ago and he
remembered only a brown taciturn man
who spoke little but was kind and gener-
ous

  he recollected their excursions together
roland wynne had ridden everywhere with
liis boy showed him the sugarwork and
various enterprises in which he was in-
terested taken him to see his few friends
who left no impression on his mind and to
visit an ancient native obi man-an ex-
perience the lad never forgot toby
pierce the strange creature was called and
wynne remembered still his strange den-
a grotesque place full of things that to the
boys intelligence had seemed weird and
horrible indeed

  weston recollected that toby pierce had
been useful to his father for the cult of
obeah was a living myth yet and the youth
remembered what his father told him on
that former visit his memory even re-
called the identical words spoken though
as a boy he had missed their irony

  jumbies and obeah are deeply religious
ideas and time has not rooted his primitive
faiths out of the ethiopians nature
quashie treasures his aboriginal gods and
demons quite as much as any the mission-
aries have presented him rut our negroes
mix their creeds and take what they like
from each

  when a man or woman dies the loup-
garou has to be reckoned with you know-

i i llpotts

 a vampire-creature that is drawn to a dead
 nigger like a cat to fish ive often heard
 the mourners- singing through a long night
 to scare away loup-garou with hymns
 ancient and modern so ancient and
 modern join hands and superstition is jus-
 tified of her children from generation to
 generation

   loups-garou take off their skins when
 at work and hide them at the roots of a
 silk-cotton tree naturally it is very de-
 sirable to find these skins because without
 them the monsters die-catch a chill i ex-
 pect ive never found one yet but per-
 haps you will weston if you hunt care-
 fully myself i have the greatest respect
 for obi and pierce is an old friend of mine

   we used to have epidemics of thievery
 in this island and christianity and the
 eighth commandment were powerless to
 stop them the cane disappeared by the
 hundredweight till toby pierce came to my
 and promised to settle the matter for a stiff
 consideration and he kept his word the
 old black devil put fort king george plan-
 tations under obeah-a high-sounding per-
 formance though it merely consisted in
 tying empty bottles and bright-colored
 rags and rubbish on sticks all round the
 estate  ut he was right-we never lost
 another cane

weston wynne had spent two
months with the harbor master of
tobago an old friend of his father and
now his affairs completed was about to
return home the properties that accrued
to him on roland wynnes death were not
to his taste as investments and he had al-
ready completed operations for the sale of
shares in a large local argave-hemp estate
found a purchaser for a grove of coconut-
palms beside the sea and sold considerable
gardens of cocoa and nutmeg which local
men were willing to take off his hands in
the course of his business with certain mer-
chants and magnates of the island wynne
had detected a general attitude not wholly
friendly to his vanished parent

   himself he was still under thirty-a
 frank and straightforward young man the
 junior partner in a prosperous business and
 roland wynne it was who had bought him
 the partnership and laid the foundation of
 a successful career half the dead mans
 capital had gone to that enterprise and the
 son entertained nothing but regard for the
ob i

memory of a generous father but he found
his own natural affection not widely re-
flected at tobago

  none indeed in his hearing spoke an
evil word against the dead but at best his
former companions were indifferent at
worst they implied to westons sensitive ear
a measure of dislike and disrespect his
host was evasive when he remarked on this
experience

   think nothing of it said teddy rice
the harbor master an irishman your
father kept himself to himself and neither
sought nor cultivated friends in business
he was frankly a hard man he let nothing
he could shift or circumvent come between
him and his purposes he was too clever
for us here and there are men among us
who have a long memory for a bad deal
nobody has any quarrel with you at any
rate and i can assure you that most of us
were sorry enough when he came by his
tragic end-sorry enough and surprized
enough

  the taking off of roland wynne had
indeed been strange and his son found a
local suspicion that the apparent manner
of it differed widely from the truth

  for two days roland wynne had been
reported missing from his home then his
clothes were found on a lonely beach at
the north side of the island they lay on
a rock fifty yards above the limit of the
sea and from them footmarks extended to
the water these left no distinct impres-
sion in the soft sand but suggested that
wynne suddenly tempted to bathe had
followed his inclination and never returned
from the water

  his horse stood tethered under the
shadow of trees a quarter of a mile distant
and it was indeed through the neighing of
the poor creature that searchers had first
been drawn to the spot once in the sea
wynne might have died of cramp or shock
or he might have been destroyed by a
shark but the improbability of the over-
seers riding to this lonely spot and delib-
erately entering the water seemed so ex-
treme that none felt satisfied the circum-
stantial evidence could be trusted

   the harbor master dilated on the sub-
ject for the benefit of roland wynnes son

   if his watch or his purse had been miss-
ing then we might fairly have argued a
crime but they werent he had as you
know ten pounds in goldin his pocket and

his gold watch and chain as well also
that pocketbook you had

  some men thought and still think that
your father did away with himself but im
not one of them he wasnt that sort at
all and im sure he found his life well worth
living though he lived it much to himself
but to me the grand mystery is why on
earth he wanted to go bathing at all that
was a most unlikely amusement for a man
of his age and habits

  thats a question of fact i suppose
he must have done it said weston he
may have been suffering from the heat and
taken a sudden fancy for a swim

  he could swim for i remember when
i was a boy out here one winter he taught
me to swim in the bathing-pool

  he never suffered from the heat in his
life answered rice and no more did an-
other man who came to an end in exactly
the same way thats another story-
fifteen years old-and yet we ancient to-
bagians were reminded of it by your
fathers death because it is an identical
mystery and was never explained and
never will be

  yes its fifteen years ago since bertram
stockly vanished off tobago and he went
bathing too and his clothes were found
not half a mile from where they found your
fathers stockly was a coconut-grower-
an amiable sort of chap without enemies
and then again-he was well over seventy
when he disappeared-a man about as like-
ly to go bathing as a land-crab every-
thing was quite straightforward in his case
also and the tragedies are parallel in almost
all particulars save that at stocklys death
no horse was involved he lived on that
side of the island and his home wasnt two
miles from where he disappeared

  is there any possible way of connecting
the two incidents inquired the young
man but rice shook his head

  i wonder the same thing but nobody
here sees any link except that in both
cases the circumstantial evidence points to
a most unlikely accident black men go
into the water with comparative impunity
though they have been snapped up some-
times but that any experienced white
should take the chances is wildly improb-
able

  so the matter stood and while wynne
mourned his fathers end and would have
made every effort to solve the problem had

eden

opportunity offered it was impossible that
he could feel any deep emotion or reach
such sorrow as he must have endured under
different circumstances his father was no
more than a well-loved name to him not a
personality

he rode now on an excursion to
amuse himself and the little stream
reminded him that here in his boyhood he
had come with his parent to see the famous
wizard who lived near by to his youthful
eyes toby pierce had seemed a creature of
infinite age and forgetting the point of
view he doubted not that the negro was
long dead

  some negresses were filling calabashes
with water at the river and weston draw-
ing up his lazy horse chatted with them
they loved to talk and were full of local
information for the most part untrust-
worthy sometimes they contradicted one
another and argued shrilly together once
or twice the rider confounded them himself
and volunteered the truth respecting  the
names of plants and other things when
he did so the girls fell in with his opinion
at once and agreed that he was right and
they were wrong

  dat so massa-massa too clebber
they said

  he asked them whether they knew any-
body cajled toby pierce

  he used to live out this way but i ex-
pect that was before your time said the
visitor then the water-carriers all spoke at
once and assured him they knew toby and
that he was very much alive

  him terrible ole secret man sar-most
dangerous ole man-you no go near him-
he obi man an do fearful tings

  im not afraid of him jane answered
weston he wont hurt me i thought
he must be dead ages ago

  obi man him nebber die sar-de debble
look after him said another girl

  where does he live-thats what i want
to know

  they pointed the way and giving them a
shilling to buy cakes weston left the party
rode on and followed a rough track that
presently abandoned the stream to climb
up a little secluded knoll at the edge of the
jungle on the summit there stood a negro-
dwelling-one somewhat larger than most
its walls were dirt-colored and the roof was
thatched with palm-leaves the place

 came back to the travelers vision un-
 changed after absence of years and he well
 remembered arriving there on a pony beside
 his father

   the spot was silent the house of the
 obi doctor very lonely no sign of liie
 appeared before the open door but frag-
 ments of things that had lived adorned it
 for on either side of the entrance stood a
 bullocks skull bleached silver-bright by the
 suns of many years a patch of sweet po-
 tatoes and a pomegranate-tree stood beside
 the hut and the estate of toby pierce also
 comprised a few banana-clumps where hung
 some fine clusters of fruit

   his boundaries were marked by a wire
 fence on which hung feathers and old beer-
 bottles at intervals of three yards within
 this weird zone no man might enter unin-
 vited and it is certain no black man would
 have done so but weston wynne felt no
 fear his only interest was psychological
 and centred in the consciousness that these
 things long faint in memory now flashed
 sharply out again he tethered his horse
 at the fence strode over it and walked
 toward the hut then he lifted his voice
 and shouted-

   toby massa pierce-massa pierce
 he was answered and a very singular
 human being appeared from behind the hut
 the creature carried an old rifle and wore
 nothing but a pair of tattered pants and a
 necklace of white teeth he was very
 ancient and his ribs made a gridiron of his
 lean breast his limbs were leather and
 bone and so thin was he that the bones
 threatened to break his skin his scanty
 wool was reduced to white tufts over his
 ears and a tangled network of furrows and
 deep tines scarred his shrunken face over
 which shone the dome of his skull but
 toby was tough and full of life his deep-
 seated black eyes shone brightly and his
 countenance was alert and intelligent de-
 spite its hideous ugliness

  who want toby he asked who
 you sar dis my land yo walk ober
 you dont remember me how should
 you yet ive been in your house before
 today toby

   i no member massa he answered
 staring intently at the visitor

   but you remember my poor father it
 was he who brought me to see you ten years
 and more ago when i was a youngster
 what him name den

  toby showed a good deal of independ-
ence and seemed not much interested in the
stranger but now his manner changed
and on hearing that the son of roland
wynne stood before him he became much
more alive

  my father died strangely you know
and i came out here to settle his affairs
and i remember that he thought a lot of
you toby so i decided that id look you
up before i sailed

  me gard yo marse wynnes son

  i am he brought me here to see you
when i was a boy and told me how clever
you were in frightening the niggers away
from the sugar-cane

  well well yo marse wynnes boy-
dat so poor geman berry sad him
drown

  i cant understand it at all toby
what did you make of it

  toby reflected and shook his withered
head

  dam bad business sar i say nuffin
but i tink a lot

  and another chap they tell me disap-
peared in the same way years ago

  dey member bout dat him go same
way as po marse wynne de debbil al-
ways busy and ebery man hab enemies-
even de good man like massa wynne
toby appeared to be full of mystery and
the other scented light he began to won-
der- whether he might be on the track of
his fathers murderers and even imagined
the ancient man before him might know
more than he chose to tell

  if there was false play toby id pay
a pretty long price to get to the bottom of
it those that knew my father best dont
for a moment believe he ever went down
to bathe in the sea

  mr pierce nodded and mumbled to him-
self

  dar plenty hid but who care what one
ole man say

  you know something toby

  wait here marse wynne answered
the other you go see yo horse him tie up
safe-den you come in and i tell you what

the ancient hopped off into his den
leaving the rifle at the door he was
lame but moved with great agility with
his back turned a look of unspeakable
malignity came into tobys face and he
showed a yellow tooth or two between his
purple lips

  but westons eyes were not upon him
he felt dazed before the coming revelation
and marveled what it might be already
he wondered if one among those whom he
had met in tobago would prove his fathers
enemy had he already shaken the hand
responsible for roland wynnes mysterious
death

   toby had hardly disappeared before he
was back again

  the hate in his face had gone and it
seemed that greed sat there instead

   one ting fore you come in my house
he said you pay me for what i tell
you

   yes i wall if you can bring me face
to face with my fathers murderer and can
prove it ill give you plenty of money
hunder pound sar

  yes toby

  i obi man-i wise nobody done
quarrel wid me-deyfrighten

  im not frightened-no more than was
my father he was your friend obis
all humbug and you know it is toby
dat so marse-you too clebber for
poor ole nigger but you no tell de folk
i humbug

   they wouldnt believe me if i did

  they entered a monstrous chamber and
it was some moments before the visitors
eyes grew accustomed to the gloom then
weird and bizarre objects thrust upon his
gaze from every side dead creatures
haunted the place and were propped in cor-
ners or hung on walls with a hideous sem-
blance of living festoons of eggs and
empty bottles depended from the roof
skins of animals and birds littered the
floor strange malodorous smells greeted
wynnes nostrils

   there was a square of red glass let into
the ceiling and from it across the velvet
gloom fell a flaming eye of light upon a
three-legged table with a copper face a
lump of glass lay here and flashed as if
red-hot filth mystery and darkness
shared the hole and across one corner was
hung a curtain which concealed arcanum-
the holy of holies

romance
i

eden phillpotts

  near it sat a little black almost naked
woman with a dirty red garment drawn
over her middle her eyes were shut and
the visitor perceived her face shrunken with
an appearance of infinite age she was
 quite motionless and appeared to be as
dead as the other fragments of animal mor-
tality-shriveled apes and bloated reptiles
-perched around her

  so indeed it proved

  dat my po wife sar-she mummy-
she die an i lub her too well to put her in
de ground so i stuff po mamie-an dar
she sit she always berry quiet lady but
now she nebber say nuffing-po galf

  weston stared at the corpse and edged
farther away from it obi was doubtless
all rubbish as he had affirmed and toby
allowed but he could well understand the
psychological effect of such a den on any
ignorant mind he liked it little himself
there was something magnetic and mes-
meric about toby despite the negros
amiability wynne began to dislike the old
man

  drawing a chair marse pierce dusted it
and begged his visitor to be seated then
he cleared the little copper table

  i fetch geman a drink den i tell him
who kill his farder said toby i tank
god him send marse wynnes son to hear
bout it

  he disappeared behind his curtain and
brought out two calabash bowls a bottle
of hollands and a jar of water then
pouring the spirit into the bowls he added
water and drank from his own

  good luck an berry long life sar an
now i tell him dat it marse teddy rice de
harbor massa-dat damn villain kill your
farder i prove bout it him pretend him
friend an he kill him

  rice good lord toby what a
mad idea-the last person on earth to do
such a thing-my fathers best pal in
tobago

  i hab de proof sar-i fetch him for
you drink de hollands-yo farder give
me dat bottle an plenty udder bottles i
no get no more now him gone

  toby emptied his own calabash then
rose and went behind the curtain weston
heard a door shut he sat bewildered and
felt that he was breathing some creepy
essence he gasped and heard his blood
beating through his arteries it seemed
unspeakably mad to suggest that rice

could have had any hand in his fathers
death yet the knowledge that no accident
had destroyed roland wynne did not as-
tonish the young man

  his mind moved slowly heavily some-
thing in the foul air of tobys den made
him drowsy he felt thirsty too for his
own flask had been emptied long ago he
lifted his calabash toby had not yet re-
turned but he thought he heard the sound
of a man digging outside

  then he prepared to drink and the bowl
was actually at his lips when his glance
happened to fall on the mummy of the
woman in the corner and he saw that her
eyes were open a moment before they
had been glued together in the puckered
and withered face a moment afterward
they were glued together again not a
sign or tremor of life was revealed by the
creature but he could have sworn that she
had looked at him

  something as near to fear as he had ever
felt took young wynne at his waistband
he knew by a sudden deep admonition that
he stood in great danger and panic-terror
nearly lifted him from his seat and sent
him flying to his horse but he mastered it
called upon his reason and made that play
servant to the intuition that now warned
him of peril

  what the peril might be and how he had
incurred it he could not guess for a mo-
ment his mind flung to the other extreme
and he was inclined to laugh at himself
and his hallucination but reason saved the
situation for he was a reasonable man
without much imagination or power of
dreaming in his waking-hours he believed
himself in danger yet knew not in the least
its nature but he could trust his eyes
the motionless creature in the corner by
the curtain was alive and she had certainly
been watching him

  she must not know that he had seen her
eyes he must proceed as if quite unsus-
picious he turned his back on her took
out his flask poured some of the contents
of the calabash into it whistled cheerfully
and then shouted out to toby-

  come on old boy-i want another
drink

  then he lifted the calabash to his mouth
and made a sound as if emptying the con-
tents down his throat while in reality he
very carefully avoided so dotng

  his manoeuvre met with an immediate

romance
o b i



and terrifying response he heard a shrill
scream behind him and turned to see
tobys wife leap from her chair and rush
away the little monster yelled at him

  yo dead yo dead man

  then she cried to toby

  him drink-him drink de calabash
dig him grave toby

  he heard a laugh outside and marse
pierce went on with his operations

  wynnes first instinct was to fight but
he knew not what powers the obi doctor
might have in reserve he made a bolt
therefore dashed after mamie who had
joined her husband and running to the
fence mounted his horse and flogged the
astonished napoleon into a gallop

  it seemed however that he was not to
escape for his hasty departure and his
power to mount the horse told the enemy
that no drop from the fatal calabash had
passed his victims lips the negro
snatched up his rifle which stood at the
door and at a range of less than fifty yards
fired at wynne just as his steed broke into
a gallop the horse reared and the man
fell off then the frightened creature gal-
loped away for once napoleon ran very
fast indeed

marse pierce putting another
cartridge into his weapon came
limping down to finish the victim if nec-
essary but then fortune ceased to smile
on the obi man and wynne in a fury of
passion leaped from the ground at his ap-
proach dashed upon him and tore the gun
from his hand it was the horse not the
rider that had been hit and with the
muzzle of his own rifle at the small of his
back toby was now driven the six long
miles that separated his habitation from
the port

  he passed the time for his captor
strangely toby indeed poured undying
hate and the reason for it into the young
mans ear it was not a long story and
that night when the priest of obi lay safe
in scarborough jail and half a dozen black
policemen set out to catch mamie and find
the stricken horse wynne gave the harbor
master particulars of his own adventure
and then proceeded to tobys own narra-
tive

  i hope the old devil was lying he said
for hes told me something that will
darken my life forever if its true it may

be though nobody can prove the truth of
it now my father is dead

  for some time when he found the game
was up the brute said nothing our prog-
ress was slow because he is lame and could
only crawl he wanted night to come
down and give him a chance to make a
bolt but we fell in with a couple of police-
men before the sun set and though they
were evidently frightened out of their wits
at toby they did as i bade them and kept
me company till i got him to the station
and saw him under lock and key by that
time the old fiend had spit out his story
to me

  it seems according to him that he and
my father were very thick many years ago
and that he was very useful to my father
in all sorts of blackguard ways i never
will believe it for if its true there must
have been a side to my father i never heard
about or guessed at-or anybody else i
should hope but he says that he and my
father were hand and glove and that he
did many a dirty trick and was useful to
my father over and over again and put
away more than one nigger for him

  he asked me who bought bertram
stocklys coconut-grove when he was sup-
posed to be drowned ten years ago and of
course i knew that father did then he
swore that he put away stockly-poisoned
him-and that the man never went near the
sea but lies buried in his own compound
outside his den and-its horrible rice-
he says my father fell out with him a month
before he died and turned on him and
stopped certain payments and so on know-
ing that tobys word could do him no
harm if thats true its terribly clear that
my father did not guess how strong and
agile the old wretch is still at any rate
he doomed himself by that quarrel

  toby waited his time and cringed and
never let my father guess what he meant
to do then after stalking him for some
weeks he got him on a lonely ride and shot
him through the head as he tried to shoot
me he took his horse and his clothes
where they were found and buried him with
the other that can be proved or dis-
proved of course

  and why did he want to poison you
asked the harbor master

  because im my fathers son as soon
as he heard that he hated me and was de-
termined to settle me too so he got me in


the mountains

and hatched the yarn about you to distract
my mind and make me forget him what
kept me from drinking was the accidental
glint in that old hags eyes another mo-
ment i should have been done for hed
set her to watch that i drank because no
doubt a drop would have had me down and
out in a twinkling and when she shut her
eyes again not guessing id seen them open
i tumbled to it all in a flash and acted ac-
cordingly and one things certain-the
money i had from the coconut-trees must
be given to any heirs of poor stockly who
are known to exist

  your father paid for the trees my dear
chap

  its an awful thing-hard to believe for
a son

  a man dont choose his own father any-
how but dont be too inquiring my dear
wynne naturally the people here weml
going to speak against the dead to you and
for my part i liked roland very well
though i couldnt help knowing he was a
bit of a buccaneer in his methods he was
always straight enough with me but you
can speak of him as you found him and
think of him as you knew him

  he was a good father anywayrice

  then let it go at that we can prove
whether toby was lying though i dont
think he was myself we shall get at the
truth when hes tried at trinidad

but marse pierce was never tried
with the help of his ragged trousers
he escaped the judgment of his fellow men
and a negro warder peeping into his soli-
tary cell after midnight found that the old
reprobate had strangled himself with his
waistband

  teddy rice was wont to tell the end of
the tale in his own fashion

  in death they were not divided for
when mamie saw her husband marched
away by young wynne he knew the game
was up and she had poisoned herself be-
fore the boys got to her

  as for the rest they found the obi
mans garden-patch a proper boneyard

  there was poor roland wynne right
enough with a bullet-hole bored through
his head alongside a skeleton we took to be
stocklys and half a dozen niggers slept
their last sleep close at hand toby sure
of his prey was already digging another
grave for our young friend when he gave
him the slip

  no-we havent encouraged obi since
then any nigger starting that game in
tobago will get himself disliked this is
a very advanced island nowadays as for
me i was only sorry for the visitor its a
nasty jar to find your father was such a
shady customer-especially if youre dead
straight yourself

 the mountains

wind blows upon them salt-edged from the ocean
rain beats upon them blackening the stone

frost heaves the ledges with obscure commotion

and the hilltops bleach like bone

dwindling mountains are they on a dwindling planet
these that look so solid these that show so fair

wind and rain and frost and hail set tooth to the granite
it wastes like smoke into air

though they now are passing like a slow word spoken

in the inch of time wherein man stands alone

he sees their rock-knees holding sees their flanks unbroken

and his heart drinks strength from the stone

yet they are at best but a short-lived generation

such as stars must laugh at as they journey forth

think of old orion that great constellation

and the dipper all alone in the north

broken dreams

by konrad bercovici

abraham zussman was the

foreman salesman manager
bookkeeper and the only working-
man of the berman silk neck-
wear mfg company of london paris
new york

  the factory was situated in the rear of
a grand street building in a fourth-floor
five-room apartment four rooms were
occupied by mr bermans family of six
the fifth room the front one was a factory
in the day-time only at night two folding
beds were wheeled into the room and the
big white-pine cutting-table was also
changed into a bed for the two berman
boys kalman and henry four

  mr berman had developed quite a trade
among the east side storekeepers but he
had engaged the young freckle-faced flat-
nosed stooping abraham because the boy
spoke english like water and could do
almost everything when abraham had
nothing else to do he went to see the store-
keepers on the west side and from there
he was sure to bring back a few orders to
keep the machines busy long strips of
silk-sausages which the dexterous mr ber-
man and some or all of his children turned
inside-out with thin sticks which they
manipulated most wonderfully became ele-
gant neckties before the berman family
were through with them between supper
and bedtime mrs berman sewed the labels
on and there was no one in the family who
could press them as well as regina berman
the manufacturers eldest daughter who
also gave the last touch to a tie before it
was packed for shipment

  on saturday evenings abraham came to
get his pay and incidentally also to enter
everything in the books and to make out
and mail the bills to the customers it was
not only his work it was his privilege

  abraham was twenty and earned only
fifteen a week but in the five years since
he had arrived in new york he had man-
aged to save a few thousand dollars his


lt

employer frequently made use of part of
this sum improved his credit by paying
his bills promptly with the loan he made
from his working man

  abrahams willingness to lend money to
his employer will be easily understood if
it is mentioned right here that he had made
up his mind to marry regina berman
regina was the ideal wife for him not
too yankeefied keeping the sabbath
speaking yiddish well a good housewife
as to her pressing neckties it was a well
known fact that she could do it better than
any one even better than abraham him-
self although he knew the trade from a to
z it was like a gift from heaven all
of bermans children were gifted in that
direction a necktie coming out of the
berman factory was a masterpiece but
regina outclassed them all

  abraham zussman never thought of her
without thinking of her ability to trans-
form a rag into a beautiful necktie in the
five years he had been in america he had
thought of nothing else but neckties and
he was sure that everybody worth while
talking to was interested in the same
subject

  regina berman was still wearing her
hair in long loose braids over her shoulders
it was the high-school girl style distin-
guishing her from the working girls her
almond-shaped large dark eyes stood well
apart on top of a lightly arched nose her
mouth was somewhat wide and full but
her chin was delicate and harmonized with
the broad forehead

  what made her still more attractive was
her cheerful disposition her sprightliness
she was always ready to smile and laugh
and sing she was the pride of the family
her picture and her school-certificate
framed and enribboned hung in the most
conspicuous part of the room over the
rolltop desk at which abraham occasionally
worked

  that regina still went to school was due
to her mothers ambition to make a school-
teacher out of her a school-teacher ap-
peared to her as the priestess of a beautiful
and useful god presiding over the destinies
of children it was no sacrilege to think
so

  was it not because of the school-teachers
that there were no pogroms in america as
in russia and had she not lost her
mother in such a pogrom and hadnt

they come here leaving a prosperous grain-
business in russia because of the pogroms
so regina had to become a school-teacher
as a compensation for what this country
was doing for the children no matter if
mr berman who had more practical plans
concerning his daughter agreed or not

   bermans plan was a very simple one
at eighteen regina was to be graduated
from high school

   abraham zussmans capital should by
then be over three thousand dollars if
abraham consented to become a partner in
the business he would take him for a son-
in-law the firm of berman  zussman
could then begin to operate on a large scale
and he berman would become the presi-
dent of his lodge-an ambition he had
nurtured because of his dislike of mr sam-
uel goldstein the  co of the firm of
cohen  co cloak manufacturers on
grand street

   regina also had plans for the future
 she wanted to become an actress because
 she knew that her parents would make life
 miserable for her if they knew her wishes
 she had seldom mentioned her desires in
 their presence

   she had occasionally spoken of acting
 as a great art as a sublime one but it
 was only to prepare the ground of course
 the bermans were very pleased when their
 daughter appeared in the amateur theatri-
 cal performances of her school but that
 was not like being a professional actress
 actors and actresses the bermans thought
 old-fashionedly were all right on the stage
 but as relatives god forgive

   with the singleness of purpose character-
 istic of women and of her race regina
 thought of nothing else but the stage and
 thought more about it because she did not
 dilute her thought with talk about her
 dreams she had seen a few plays in eng-
 lish and had been quite often with her
 parents to the yiddish theater on second
 avenue where a sixty-year-old rather
 portly woman played the role of a sixteen-
 year-old girl and drew tears from the easily
 impressed audience

   when regina was seventeen mr ber-
man began to bestir himself in her and his
own behalf he had seldom contradicted his
wife he hated scenes like all jewish
husbands he was the real master of the
house so he let his wife go on dreaming
about the teaching-profession for regina
broken dreams

knowing that his own plans would ulti-
mately be realized

  you know abraham i want you to
devote more time to sales you can talk
english like water i will raise your salary
and give you a commission on sales a
man cant turn a machine and run after
customers at the same time you have a
good head on your shoulders and we two-
well whats the use of slumoosing-take
the sample case and good-luck to you
abraham and if you think you can do
better in hoboken or long island go there
you are your own boss said berman one
morning to zussman for the machine
i have hired another man

thus abraham zussman became the
general salesman of the firm he
brought more orders than that working
man and the whole family working over-
time every night of the week could fill
and when berman had hired a second
working man abraham zussman printed a
business-card for himself

mr a zussman
general sales manager
of the

berman neckwear mfg co

london new york  paris

  his pay-envelope now contained thirty
dollars and more every week and the loans
to his employer increased in size and fre-
quency bermans own capital was little
more than zero

  berman began to be anxious to conclude
his plans he was afraid that some mar-
riage-broker might get hold of the boy and
set all his plans to naught whenever
abraham returned from his travels ber-
man invited him to stay for dinner with
the family and seated him near regina

  once when zussman had returned late in
the evening from jersey city in a heavy
rain berman dropped the newspaper he
was reading and asked that tea be brought
to he young man his wife went to pre-
pare the samover but berman called to his
daughter regina

  you make tea for him it will be
sweeter ha abraham what do you say
look how wet he is look out or you will
catch cold take your coat off

  soon the samover was on the table and
regina prepared tea for the two men

  wont you drink tea with us asked



the young man encouraged by her fathers
previous remark it will taste better in
your company

  hey mama have you heard what abra-
ham said look at him

  regina called to her mother who was
busy in the kitchen

  as she spoke she also poured tea for her-
self and sat down opposite the young man
and looked at him with amused eyes old
berman could hardly contain his joy when
regina lighted a match for abrahams
cigar-he smoked cigars now that he was
a salesman on the road business demanded
it

  next thing you know he will send a
schatchen papa regina cried out as she
filled abrahams glass again

  keep your mouth shut you shameless
chatterbox her mother cried that girl
becomes impossible

  sha-ska what are you so mad at do
you think that abraham zussman is not a
nice name and does he not come from a
good family what intervened mr
berman a woman will get in the air for
nothing

  you too keep your mouth shut-you
talk like an old woman god forgive
solomon i tell you you keep your mouth
shut mrs berman admonished her hus-
band as she entered the room

  abraham felt very ill at ease for a while
but he found solace in the look regina gave
him	

  the following evening saturday abra-
ham invited the girl to a show regina
accepted eagerly after one look at her
father she dared not look at her mother
where she knew there was disapproval

  when she went into the next room to
dress her mother followed her and had
it out with the girl berman scented the
brewing storm and as he did not want the
young man to hear what his wife told her
daughter-the walls separating east-side
rooms are very thin-he took abraham to
the remotest corner of the shop to show
him some new samples of silk he had just
received

  when the two young people were gone
the children were given nickels and dimes
to go out and buy candies and husband
and wife threw their cards on the tables
what do you mean by letting her go
out with that man the nerve of that
nobody to come and invite my daughter to

else since she was that high i have put up
with everything to keep her in school but
not because i wanted abraham to have a
learned wife

  better send her to a nunnery then
interrupted her husband

  do you think pounded the woman on
the table that i have sent her to a high
school that she should marry abraham
zussman what solomon i tell you
it will not be it will not be i tell you
solomon berman put an end to her rav-
ings by letting himself into his overcoat
and announcing that he had an important
meeting at his lodge he left his wife to
herself

when the children returned sucking
red lollypops they found their
mother in a crying-fit that touched their
hearts she had thrown herself full length
across the bed and was tearing the pillow
with her hands

  whats the matter kalman asked

  his mothers sorrow was so contagious
that he felt like crying himself

  the mother did not answer soon all of
them lent their voices to the song of broken
dreams

  hours later when regina all flushed
had come home from the theater and a visit
to the ice-cream parlor she found her
mother and the little ones sleeping huddled
together on the large bed she understood

not all but enough she knew the motif
of the despair but she had her own
dreams to realize her own life to live

  abraham had taken her to a second
avenue theater at the box-office he had
asked for the best seats in the house in
the lobby he had met several acquaintances
to whom he introduced miss berman only
too proud to be seen with the daughter of
his employer

  he had never before been inside a the-
ater the luxury of it all the mosaic
floor the colored walls the frescoes the
painted heads of the muses the gorgeously
blazoned ceiling with the thousand and
one lights protruding from little plaster
ornaments gave him a thrill he had never
experienced before

  to his left sat regina she insisted on
telling him the story of the play which she
had already seen the winter before in the
animation of speech she put her thin warm
hand over his thick freckled fingers the
feel of it was enough to make any ones
blood tingle and dance

  its sure now she will be my wife
he thought

  in the tense moments of the play she
passed her arm in his and even leaned her
head on his shoulders when the intriguing
woman on the stage was stealing the hus-
band of the good wife-the good and over-
faithful wife of all the stages of the world

  abraham looked at the stage but saw
little and understood less of what was going
on not because the play was too compli-
cated for him his mind dwelt on one
thing

  she will be my wife no one can press
a necktie better than she does

  between the third and the fourth act he
bought her a box of chocolates from one of
the hawking boys sauntering between the
rows

  on the way home as he was elbowing
space for two through the dense crowd of
ample women and slow-moving men she
pressed even nearer to him by the time
they were sitting opposite each other in the
ice-cream parlor they had progressed so
far that he had dropped the miss and
called her regina it was after the ice-
cream that the girl sent her first shaft by
claiming that she could play the role of the
star much better than that fat actress

  bewildered by her pretension he just
said maybe sparring for time on the

romahce
broken dreams



way home she confided a little more of her
secret to him she intended to become an
actress he was the only one to whom she
had ever confided her dream he must not
mention a word about it to anybody

  he promised she even asked him to
come to see her act at the performance her
school was putting on he promised to
come before he had said good night she
patted him on the shoulder as he lifted
his hat to her she put a finger on her lips

  but not a word of this to any one
good night and thanks she called out as
she ran up the dark stairs of the ill-illumi-
nated moldy ill-smelling hallway

  the following evening abraham invited
regina for a walk on the avenue the girl
accepted the invitation against the feeble
protests of her mother strange how her
attitude toward abraham zussman had
changed in a few days he had never ex-
isted at all as far as she was concerned he
was a working man in her fathers shop
to a romantic girl of reginas type a youth
such as abraham had no attraction whatso-
ever

  and suddenly the change because she
had confided her dream to him he became
a different man in her eyes because he had
listened to her and had not contradicted
not scoffed not discouraged she was anx-
ious to be alone with him again walk by
his side on crowded second avenue and
pour into his ears all she had dreamed of
since she was a child-a stage an audience
and she the center of it all

   as soon as they were on the street abra-
ham opened the conversation by telling her
that he had thought the whole night about
what she had told him the previous day

   i think you could be a great actress

  she slipped her arm in his and an-
swered-	

  thats very nice of you to think so
and woman-like she made him assure her
again and again that she was to be a great
actress

  and i will come to see you act on the
stage and you will not even know that i am
there regina he-moaned sadly as he sat
down on a bench in stuyvesant square

  dont be a child abraham she re-
plied nestling close to him you will
help me become a great actress-thats
what you will do wont you

  i how

  but she would not tell him how it was

high time to return home with her to-
morrow if he wished he could take her to
the theater to the english theater where
they played hamlet he promised on
the way home she told him the story of the
play dwelling chiefly on the great role of
ophelia abraham was greatly impressed
he was only too anxious to go and see the
play with her the following evening they
stood in the hallway of her home and talked
a little longer

  but said zussman before leaving
wouldnt your mother be against it-i
mean that you should go with me to the
theater

  leave ma to pa she laughingly an-
swered as she allowed him to hold her
hand in his

when abraham zussman came to in-
vite regina to the theater the fol-
lowing evening the girls eyes were very
red but her braids were no longer hanging
over her shoulders she was dressed ready
to go and there was strong decision in her
voice as she said to the boy-

  we must hurry abraham its getting
late

  regina you have cried abraham said
to her as soon as they were on the street

  oh its nothing she answered press-
ing his arm and kept very quiet on the way
to the play

  she was very quiet all through the per-
formance abraham tried hard to make
conversation during the evening but she
was not so disposed

  on the way home she asked him-

  how do you like the play

  i did not think of the play i thought
tonight of your eyes-you have cried and
i know its because of me its the same
thing i know regina

  she had to console him yes her
mother was against her against the the-
ater did not want her to become an
actress

  but i want you to become an actress
and i am going to show them what i can
do abraham cried out suddenly the-
ater is just as good a business as neckties
if not a better one-youll see

  will you do that oh abraham

   she pressed his arm even closer

  will i and he returned the pressure
  it was as good as an engagement be-

  fore saying good night to each other they
  kissed at the foot of the stairs

    neither mother nor father felt like ask-
 ing questions the next morning when abra-
 ham walked from the shop into the living-
 room and announced boldly to mr and
 mrs berman that he and regina were en-
 gaged and that he had bought her a ring

    mazeltoff tnazeltoff i wish you luck
  solomon berman exclaimed as abraham
  put the ring on reginas finger but you
  could have asked us-i am her father am
  i not there is her mother too-but
  well-america-children here dont ask
  their parents

 the two parents soon woke up to the
 fact that their little regina was a
 woman striking out for her own shores
 she quit school without as much as by-
 your-leave and boldly announced that she
 was going to become an actress whereas
 abraham zussman had formerly been
 grateful for the slightest favor shown him
 by his employers wife he now expected
 little services and accepted them as if
 they were due him

   and solomon berman too woke up to
 something he had not expected he had
 expected abraham to consider the marriage
  to his daughter and the subsequent inevi-
 table partnership in the firm as a stroke of
 fortune that comes once in a thousand years
 to one of two million men but now with-
 out many preliminaries abraham an-
 nounced that he was not going to invest
 his money in the necktie business abra-
 hams decision made berman realize that
 it was he who ought to be thankful to abra-
 ham zussman for taking his daughter in
 lawful wedding without demanding any
 dowry abraham had money three thou-
 sand dollars what had berman noth-
 ing at all

   there were two distinct groups now in
 the house berman and his wife and abra-
 ham zussman and regina the younger
 ones had the deciding voice in everything
 abraham already bossed the factory re-
 gina bossed the house when it finally
 came again to words between husband and
 wife mrs berman said

    i say solomon the quicker they marry
 the better it will be i am not responsible
 for what is going to happen if she keeps
 it up that way

  you may be right for all the good it
will do me now let them get married

  after reflecting for a few moments ber-
man continued

  maybe you could have a little shmoos
with your daughter about the partnership
what do you say leah

  i say nothing but i think it was re-
gina that put that idea in his head not to
come in partnership with us what does
she care about her father and mother
she wants to be an actress she speaks of
him you should hear her solomon as if
he were who knows what-as if we dont
know who he is i would never have slaved
for her the way i did the mother cried

  what brought about all this change
what questioned solomon berman talk-
ing more to himself than expecting any an-
swer to his query

  but his wife was ready with the answer
as if the question was just the thing she
had waited for

  when i wanted to talk about it to you
that night when he invited her to the the-
ater you had an important meeting at the
lodge she mimicked ha a meeting
at the lodge was more important to you
than the future of your daughter the
dream of your wife

  solomon berman knew the answer to his
query now it was youth against old age

  i think it well that she should marry
early in the spring eh leah

  let them marry when they will she
has broken my heart i dont care much
what she does now said the disappointed
mother

  you wanted a school-teacher ha if
not a school-teacher you dont care you
come from a race of school-teachers ha
only school-teachers  

  and there was raillery bitterness sar-
casm in his voice it made the woman
cry he regretted his words he had
never spoken to her in such a tone before

  you did not understand me leah
why must it be regina it will be malka
your youngest daughter is she not your
child too come on dont cry malka
has good reports she is bright she is
smart it will be malka what

  its not the same solomon its not the
same it never will be the same it never
will be the same i tell you she cried yet
she was thankful to her husband for the
suggestion

broken dreams

  he felt that his words had taken root

  why is it not the same is she not our
child as well as regina better make some
tea for us i feel i want some tea

  leah started to put the glasses on the
table and going to and fro she spoke
partly to herself partly to her husband

  and reallyj why not if its not re-
gina it will be malka a few years later
well what does it count a few years
sooner a few years later what does it
count ha

  of course it doesnt sit down and
have your tea

abraham and regina went frequently
to the theaters to the yiddish ones
at first and to broadway afterward he
had seen regina act in the amateur per-
formance she had spoken about and was
impressed by her ability then he thought
that she could do such things at least as
well or even better than pressing neckties

  yet later on when he had seen other act-
ors he was not so sure about that there
were many things that she had yet to learn
he concluded she was of course very
gushy about her talents as well as all
stage-struck young people

  they went together to the theaters but
each had his or her own thoughts and rea-
sons for doing so she wanted to see roles
he came to observe the business-end of the
theater reginas theatrical inclination
had set his mind traveling in a new direc-
tion he informed himself about expenses
and incomes of the theater about actors
and plays about the chance of gain and
loss

  the stage the thousands of heads the
cries the laughter the problems proposed
and resolved-the whole thing represented
to him only a different business in which
there were bigger chances than in the one
he was in just then it had never occurred
to him before that there was another busi-
ness than neckties for him until then it
was not love for his intended wife or in-
clination that urged him in that direction
it was simply a chance to make more
money in a different business than neckties

  he realized at once that his capital was
ridiculously small for such an enterprise
he had formerly thought of himself as a
rich man in his old business three thou-
sand dollars was a capital to be reckoned
with in the theatrical business he soon

learned it was about enough for one days
expenses tens of thousands of dollars
were spoken of as lightly as if the dollars
represented cents it was a big business
the ante was bigger it made him look on
his own capital as something to be risked
easily on a chance of making more money
quickly

  he began to visit with regina and
alone the cafes frequented by yiddish act-
ors in the course of a few months he had
gathered all the information necessary
conversation with better informed men
gave him a certain polish his willingness
to stand treat endeared him to many his
larger vision served him even in his work as
a salesman he brought in more orders
now in a day than he used to bring in in
his best week a few morfths before

  to carry out these orders he had to ad-
vance money to berman to buy two more
machines a cutting-table and several other
things he became more than a partner in
the business he practically was its owner
but he looked on it as a side-line his ears
and eyes were open for other things bigger
things-the theater

  only a few months before regina had
been infinitely his superior her ambitions
and her learning as a high-sqhool girl were
sky-high that she consented to go out
with him he had considered a heavenly
privilege in spite of the fact that he had
planned to marry her years before but
now he towered over her his ambitions
were greater and what he had picked up
from here and there was more than she had
ever known he laughed to himself when
he thought how much he had admired this
and that inferior actor and the trashy plays
that he had seen at first

  reginas ambitions well love now
did not color his judgment about her abil-
ity there was much she had to learn
and if she succeeded she would be a good
asset in the business stars commanded
big prices three and four hundred dollars
a week if he could save that at the be-
ginning it would make things easier but
with or without her he was determined to
enter the theatrical field he had very
little to lose and the prospects were large
thousands tens of thousands the yid-
dish theater was a mint

  regina too felt that abraham had be-
come her superior long before they were
married she took orders from him it was
konrad bercovic

he who enrolled her as a pupil in an east-
side acting-school treating her as one with
superior knowledge treats a beginner she
began to love him he was a man a real
man and would make her a great actress
the yiddish stage at first and then broad-
way broadway her name in electric
lights broadway-a star on broadway

  in the shop solomon berman was now
little more than a salaried employee he
also took orders from the future son-in-
law it dispirited him so that he did not
even attempt to run for the presidency of
his lodge to compete with goldstein who
had been a tailor at home and was now a
manufacturer of clothing in america

  when the wedding of regina berman
and abraham zussman finally took place
the guests of abraham outnumbered and
outshone the guests that came by bermans
invitations abrahams guests were writers
and actors it clearly established the fact
that the bermans were passe and the zuss-
mans on the rise it was not at all as ber-
man thought it would be-that he would
have to apologize for accepting abraham
zussman as his son-in-law it looked as if
abraham zussman had condescended to
marry regina berman the dowryless
daughter of a necktie-manufacturer

at the beginning of the following sea-
son abraham was the owner of the
regina theater on second avenue how
had he bought it by willing it by bor-
rowing money from the bank by a few
successful and daring real-estate operations
instead of neckties the factory now turned
out putees for the army and twenty ma-
chines worked day and night in three shifts
yet all these things each one with its pos-
sibility of riches were only side-affairs
the main track of abraham zussmans
mind was occupied with theatrical projects

  he laid his plans rapidly actors and
playwrights sought his company and lis-
tened to his opinions he was invariably
right his point of view was that of the
public the public was his business he
studied his business he left his wife to
watch the show from a first-row seat he
went to the gallery and observed the people
noted when they laughed or cried when
the interest sagged orrose when his the-
ater was ready to open for the season his
education was finished

  in the first play to be produced his wife

had a very important role she was the
star during the preparation for the sea-
son abraham was too busy with other
things to see his wife rehearse that end
of the business was in the hands of a capa-
ble director who assured mr zussman that
she was a genius

  regina worked with him every day
who can describe the jealousies of the
other actresses how they spoke of the
luck of that slip of a girl lucky enough to
marry a man rich enough to buy a theater
for his wife to act in how they flattered
regina when they spoke to her and how
unfiatteringly they spoke of her behind her
back every little mistake of routine of
the novice was immediately reported and
guffawed about to eager listeners in cafes
and restaurants

  that lucky slip she is a star now
she has her own theater wait till the first
night whats the use the critics have
probably been paid to praise i leave that
to abraham zussman were the continual
remarks

  regina did not know in what world she
was living she was scared by what she
had desired since childhood it had all
happened so quickly that her enthusiasm
had had no time to cool off the director
sure that zussman went into the business
only for his wifes sake thought it his duty
to be very flattering to regina and assure
her that she had but to appear on the stage
to have the world at her feet

  to regina her husband was her god
he had never told her his reasons for going
into the theatrical business she took it
for granted that it was because he wanted
her to shine as a star how grateful she
was to him for his confidence in her how
she loved him for his willingness to risk his
capital to satisfy her ambition she must
she must succeed more for his sake than
for her own how he must have loved her
during the years he had been working for
her father it was as one reads in stories

the night of the first performance
slowly at first but in the last half-
hour very rapidly the theater had filled
the east side is always eager to go to the
theater now more than ever before so
many new dresses to show bediamonded
fingers heavy golden chains crossing under
and over overgrown abdomens

  through the peeping-hole of the big

adventuring



curtain regina watched the theater as it
filled to capacity soon the musicians ap-
peared at the first bar of the national
hymn all heads shot up some still munch-
ing fruit others sucking candies and speak-
ing to one another children cried aloud
ushers were running to and fro boys
hawked chocolates and sodas it seemed
more like a huge exhibition of prosperity
than a theatrical audience

  then the curtain rose for the first act
and the noise instantly ceased from the
first moment of her appearance it was clear
that regina would not take her own
lack of experience stood in her way and
the others especially the woman next to
her in importance madame sherman did
all that could be done to accentuate the
stars bewilderment and ignorance of
routine

  the prompter spoke so loud that he was
heard better than the actress and when-
ever the audience was supposed to cry
loud laughter was heard the test of a
play and an actor on the east side is tears
the more the better

  when the curtain fell after the first act
regina berman in the language of actors
was dead

  she walked through the other acts as
through a series of-torture-chambers only
once during all the performance had she
seen abraham

  brace up girl brace up dont worry
it will be o k was all he said to her

  she hardly dared to face him when it
was all over he came into her dressing-

room and sat down near her she cried and
cried

  abraham abraham after all you have
done for me i am unworthy unworthy of
you

  well its all right it will not kill us
he answered

  but we are ruined i have ruined you
she moaned

not at all i have already told mad-
ame sherman to take your role tomorrow
what do you mean-mme sherman
well you dont expect me to let you
continue now-do you

  what is it not all over wont you
give up the theater now she flared up for
a moment

 why should i because you have
failed a business like that does not de-
pend on one single actress the loss is not
so terrible as you think of course it
would have been better more economical-
but that does not matter much madame
sherman takes your place i will engage
some one else in her stead and-i will dis-
miss the cashier you could take her place
and save me some money until you can
return again to the stage

  so you have not done it all for me
for me only abraham she asked as if
roused from a long-drawn dream her eyes
wide open her mouth agape

  what do you mean for me only
the theater is a business-a big business
and because this shattering of two
dreams in one evening was more than she
could stand she laughed and cried and
laughed again

swine

maina lo the shell-divers
daughter took from the shelf
above the hearth a heart-shaped
pearl shell and a small leather
sack tlacing the shell upon a low stool
in the middle of the floor she shook into it
twelve small gray seed-pearls from the
sack and poured over them half a cup of
coconut-oil from an earthen vessel on
her knees her elbows resting on the edge
of the stool she pursed her lips and blew
softly upon the surface of the oil

   her father watched her intently from
 his mat peering over her shoulder with his
 watery brine-blinded eyes a broken stump
 of a clay pipe between his toothless gums
 old and decrepit was aoku the shell-diver
 the icy clutch of twenty fathoms had
 squeezed the warm blood from his veins
 and left him a paralytic helpless wreck
 dependent upon the charity of the inhabi-
 tants and upon the bounty of the occa-
 sional traders whose schooners tarried in
 the lagoon for a few hours between the
 tides

   what see you in the shell daughter
 he croaked raising himself on palsied
 knees

   without answering maina lo continued
 blowing until the funnel-shaped opening
 made in the oil by her breath touched the
 bottom of the shell and caused eleven of
 the twelve small pearls to arrange them-
 selves in a circle about the base the
 twelfth and largest stayed in the center of
 the circle and no amount of blowing could
 dislodge it

   a strange ship will enter the straits
 she answered gazing into the shell with
 her face between her hands we shall
 have food much food my father i see a
 very white sahib with hair like the sun and
 eyes the color of mother of pearl

   it is time aoku mumbled perhaps
 it is perrot the trader he is free with
 his purse and he favors you

   perrot the frenchman is a swine she

cried sooner would i starve than eat
from his hand have you forgotten his
perfidy with other maidens aileta who
leaped from the cliff and others

  aoku shook his head and gazed at the
floor

  i am an old man he whined soon
i shall be gone have i not labored for
you these many years it is time you took
a man among our own people not one
finds favor with you then why spurn you
this white trader who has much gold and
fine houses

  the frenchman is a swine maina lo
repeated think you he would take me
to dwell as his wife not he i am still
a maid and a maid i remain until-
until- she paused and patted her fathers
wrinkled cheek-until my heart calls
me

  we shall starve aoku whimpered

i am an old man-

  rest easy my father i am young and
strong i can dive tomorrow i begin
who knows but some day i may bring up
a great pearl 

  but you are a woman he remon-
strated and good to look upon the men
will laugh you to scorn

  yes she said slowly i am a woman
-and good to look upon

  she rose to her feet poured the oil from
the shell and replaced the twelve small
pearls in the sack

  a quiet serious-minded girl was maina
lo with rather heavy sensuous lips and
somber eyes that somehow suggested-slum-
bering passions she had the respect of
traders and natives alike for she was a
good girl also she was beautiful a rare
combination along the straits of malaita
where beauty and virtue rarely go hand in
hand

  from her crown of glossy black hair to
her finely-arched bare feet she was good to
look upon proud of bearing she was high-
breasted as venus with the aristocratic
blood of her race flowing undiluted in her
veins

  she was proud of this blood upon the
free and easy unions between maidens of
her race and the white masters she looked
with scorn her mind primitive and un-
tutored though it was grasped the signifi-
cance of such unions and their effect upon
the destiny of her race

  in a vague sort of a way she understood

that she and her people were inferior to the
white man who seemed to possess every-
thing in the world worth possessing she
wondered why it seemed unjust did
she not love hate eat and drink as they
did not the sun smile on white and brown
alike and the soft-trade winds did not they
kiss the graves of both races impartially

  the brown man toiled no longer at his
ancestral pursuits rum had left in him
no desire for the old simple life upon
his women a new and sinister value had
been placed and he had sunk low enough
to take advantage of it

  maina lo pondered much upon these
signs and hot hatred grew in her heart
against the white man and her debased
brethren had she lived in new york in-
stead of upon danrhyn atoll she would
have been an ardent suffragette

at any price originally the lifeboat of a

her for five pounds sterling from the cap-
tain of the ship who was anxious to use
the deck-room which it displaced for stow-
ing cargo aoku had dragged the boat
upon the beach overhauled her from stem
to stern decked her over with a deck of

with a long slender mast mainsail top-

squared away before the wind

  the moonbeam leaped in response to the
increased pressure of sail and buried her
nose in the turbulent greenness under her

two heavy braids about her head she had
fastened the braids securely with shell-pins
and raffia in preparation for the diving a
snug-fitting sleeveless tunic of woven raffia
encased her slender body from the armpits
to the knees giving her absolute freedom of
movement a very necessary thing in
twenty fathoms of water

  when the sun rose warm and dripping
from the eastern sea she cast aside her
covering blanket the warm wind raced
through the loosely woven tunic and drove

women of her race to engage in pearl-div-

dependent upon her for food and shelter

of the great barrier reef were rich in the
early days of the industry but years had
passed from plenty to scanty from scanty
to poverty his body becoming more use-
less and withered from month to month

  maina lo grew into young womanhood
among the fleet capable and earnest al-
ways learning always inquiring the ablest
and most skilful sailor on the lagoon the
pilot at duralong never ceased to relate
how he watched her from the lighthouse
drive the moonbeam across the bar in a
black northeaster at low tide with a double-
reefed mainsl	

  with decks awash and the mainboom
dragging in the trough  the seas maina
lo rounded point miguel and nosed her
way close-hauled along the barrier reef
looking for a safe passage the wind
threw the boat on her beam-ends under the
heavy sail-pressure and she was forced to
furl the topsl and outer jib

  so busy was she dodging submerged
reefs and taking in her high canvas that
she did not notice a bank of dark clouds
rising with incredible swiftness out of the

northern sea the first intimation she had
of the approaching hurricane was when
looking across the straits she saw an in-
coming bark furl her canvas down to lower
topsls and square away to sea

  through her glasses she made out the
bark to be the pappulon the french
prison-ship that for the past two years en-
gaged in transferring prisoners from the
penal colony of new caledonia to cayenne

anxiously watching the oncoming
cloud-bank she ran the boat into the
wind double-reefed the mainsl and set the
storm-jib there was but one thing to do
follow the pappulon out to sea to look
for shelter along the reef was worse than
useless swift as she worked she had hard-
ly tied the last knot in the reef when the
hurricane burst upon her

  so sudden and furious was the onslaught
that the boat was thrown on her beam-
ends with the storm-jib pounding in the
teeth of the gale threatening momentarily
to dismast her maina lo leaped for the
tiller and threw all her weight against it
but with her deck buried amidships in
storm-whipped water the moonbeam lost
all steerageway and pounded head on into
the seas one after another the reef-lashed
waves raked the frail craft from stem to
stern with her knees braced against the
lee bulwarks in water to the waist maina
lo hung on to the tiller in grim desperation
expecting momentarily to be dashed to
pieces upon a reef

  then gradually the moonbeam paid off
righted herself and tore out to sea before
the hurricane in the two-mile wake of the
pappulon

  to prevent getting carried overboard
she tied the main halyards around her
waist and made the end fast to a ring-bolt
in the deck in less than half an hour she
was out of sight of land racing before the
eighty-mile gale with the jib-sheet taut as
a violin string and the hurricane howling
in the rigging through the flying mist
ahead she saw the pappulons lower topsls
blow out in a shower of shreds leaving the
bark running before the wind with bare
poles

  the last of the young sun hung lurid and
ghostly behind the black clouds astern
sky and water seemed to unite in a frenzy
of storm-lashed fury a lone albatross
swept down the gale before her and was
some pearls and a swine

swallowed up in the blackness ahead she
was utterly alone in the turbulent expanse
of storm-whipped waters hanging on the
tiller with numb nerveless hands

  then the deluge the heavens seemed
to open their flood-gates howling snarl-
ing raging came the icy spume-laden
downpour whipping the surface of the
waters into a veritable caldron of leaping
fury it beat upon her bare arms and legs
with the sting of a lash and drove the
breath out of her body

  the frail craft shuddered beneath the
weight of it and wallowed for minutes at
the time submerged to the bulwarks only
to rise gallantly again shake herself and
leap forward on the crest of the next wave

  never for a moment did maina los
heart fail her with numb frozen hands
she grasped the tiller in a grip of steel
guiding the moonbeam through the chaos
of wind and water even momentarily she
did not relax her vigilance she looked
upon the white merciless death about her
and smiled the fear of death was not in
her with blinded eyes she strove to pierce
the gloom ahead so low hung the clouds
that it seemed as if by reaching out her
hand she might touch them

  sun nor stars broke the inky pall and
the sea beneath was like a caldron of mad-
ly boiling milk a great expanse of blind-
ing whiteness the hiss of the rain was
drowned in the thundering noise of the
waters pouring over the boat

  how long it lasted she could not have
told when the squall passed on she saw
the pappulon a scant quarter of a mile
ahead her rigging and white slender
spars stood drawn against the blackness of
the sky like a delicate silver-threaded pat-
tern upon a curtain of black velvet she
was laboring heavily without a stitch of
canvas a storm-torn signal of distress
fluttered from the mizzen gaff

  with the cessation of the rain the waves
began to rise the sea changed in aspect
great mountains of water lifted the moon-
beam toward the sky and flung her forward
with incredible speed the little craft
plunged on her head down green phos-
phorescent valleys of abysmal depth
climbed up the next wave bravely only to
be tossed as by some giant hand into the
sky and go coasting madly again

  with a deafening roar a great sea bore
down upon her maina lo set her teeth

flung herself face down upon the deck and
took a fresh turn about her waist with the
halyards for one breathless moment she
waited with the thunder of the oncoming
waters in her ears the moonbeam lay
momentarily passive like a hunted stag
awaiting the coup de grace

  then with a last brave attempt to meet
the onslaught she staggered into the
thundering death the tiller snapped in
maina los hand like a piece of match-
wood with terrific force she was hurled
against the mast the waist-rope almost
cutting her in twain by the force of the
onrushing waters

  bereft of the guiding hand the moon-
beam swung broadside to the seas the
jib blew out with the noise of a blast top-
mast and jib-boom went crashing over the
side

  stunned and half-drowned maina lo
groped her way on hands and knees along
the engulfed deck to the companionway
and tore the hatchet from the rack with
bleeding hands she chopped the tangled
rigging adrift to prevent the dragging top-
mast from pounding a hole in the side of
the boat

  on examination she found the rudder
carried away only a broken splinter of
wood remained swinging uselessly above
the water-line cutting one of the oars
from its lashings she chopped a deep notch
in the stern laid the oar in the notch and
lashed it securely to the top hinge of the
broken rudder then rising to her feet
she threw her weight against the oar and
righted the boat

  she was almost abreast of the pappillon
fifty yards to starboard the great black
hull of the prison-ship towered monstrously
above her her stern pointing toward the
sky she was foundering by her head
focsle-head and forward deck lay en-
gulfed to the fore-hatch crowsnests and
rigging were crowded with human forms
awaiting the end the fragments of two
splintered lifeboats dragged in the water
from the tackle at her davits

  against the railing of the poop-deck a
crowd of prisoners was lined up two
sailors with hammers and chisels were strik-
ing the shackles from the unfortunate men
across the iron hawser-bits as fast as he
was freed each man leaped for the rig-
ging

  the bark was drifting helplessly before
carl clausen

the gale with her forward hold half-full
of water she staggered drunkenly to her
grave curious incredulous faces stared
down at the frail craft with the lone half-
nude figure of a girl standing upright in the
stern guiding the boat with only an oar
a sailor in the mizzen truck waved his
souwester to her

  above the tumult of the wind came
faintly the sound of voices they were
cheering her from the rigging and yard-
arms flashed a message of tribute from a
hundred doomed men then suddenly the
great bark plunged head down in the waves
up to the mainmast her stern rose in the
air with the dripping rudder pointing to
the sky one by one the men in the rig-
ging dropped into the sea the two sailors
abandoned their hammers and chisels and
leaped from the railing of the poop

   in the stern stood the solitary figure of
a man silhoutted against the sky with
manacled hands raised above his head the
last of the prisoners whom the sailors had
abandoned in their efforts to save them-
selves a giant of a man he was with a
great shock of yellow curls dancing in the
gale he was signaling to her pointing
astern with his manacled hands

   maina lo measured the distance with her
eyes cast all her weight upon the oar and
swung the moonbeam under the stem
quarter of the bark tying a bowline in
the main halyards she threw the rope over-
board and signaled her readiness with a
terrific swing the man brought down his
manacled wrists across the hawser-bit
breaking the shackle-chain then he
leaped

   straining at her oar maiija lo saw his
head rise in the wake of the sinking bark
a few feet astern the moonbeam stag-
gered momentarily as the man caught the
dragging rope and rose half-way out of
the water with the sudden strain the
next moment two bloody mangled arms
with the broken shackle-chains dangling
from the torn flesh were thrust over the
railing grasping the man beneath the
armpits maina lo dragged him to safety
and sprang back to her oar just as the
last of the pappulon disappeared beneath
the waves

night came with the hurricane spent
and a chill moon rising out of the
sea weary and worn maina lo left her

 oar and knelt beside the prostrate form
 upon the deck by neither sound nor
 movement did the man betray sign of life
 one mangled wrist lay across a forehead
 white as death the broken shackle-chain
 swung tangled in his hair with the move-
 ments of the boat she looked at the man
 helplessly to all appearances he was
 dead she had risked her life and boat to
 no purpose

   when she accidentally touched his fore-
 head with the tips of her fingers she
 thought she saw a faint flutter of the eye-
 lids she placed her ear against his breast
 and listened breathlessly barely percep-
 tible yet unmistakably came the soft beat-
 ing of his heart life was not quite ex-
 tinct

   for several minutes she sat looking at
 him perplexedly across the moon-flooded
 waste long swift lines of ponderously cat-
 footed rollers moved from horizon to hori-
 zon breaking in menacing white-capped
 thunder about the boat phalanx after
 phalanx of storm-torn clouds charged the
 young ascending moon

   the storm still raged in the higher levels
 though but the merest breath of wind
 fanned her cheek as the boat coasted down
 the rollers a blue layer of chill shroudy
 mist hung low over the sea with an in-
 terminable stretch of clear sparkling space
 above a sinister brooding peace of fury-
 gorged elements enwrapped the universe

   against the deck the face of the uncon-
 scious man glowed ghastly beneath his
 matted brine-soaked locks that moved
 medusa-like in the wash of the deck with
 the pitching of the boat a strange freak
 of circumstances had placed in maina los
 hands the fate of one of the hated race
 only in the fact that he was a convict and
 therefore in the estimation of his own
 people -no better than she did maina lo
 -find in her heart a sense of pity for him

  like herself he was very young a
downy golden beard covered his vigorous
aggressive jaw his nose was straight fine-
ly molded with sensitive blue-veined nos-
trils there was  bold careless quality
in the repose of his face where his shirt
lay open the skin of his throat glowed soft
and velvety beneath its coat of sun-bitten
tan a pathetic boyish look reminiscent
of a brutally disillusioned childhood hung
about the corners of his mouth

   taking his head in her lap she began
some pearls and a swine

to rub his face and chest briskly and rolled
him back and forth to induce circulation
in his frozen arteries after several min-
utes of unceasing labor she was rewarded
by feeling the play of his reviving muscles
under her touch when she placed the
water-soaked blanket under his head he
opened his eyes for a fraction of a minute
and gazed up at her unseeingly

  letting her hand fall upon his shoulder
she leaned over him breathlessly searching
his eyes by the faint light of the moon
deep blue the color of mother of pearl
they gazed beyond her into nothingness
when he had closed them again she sat
lost in thought studying the blank repose
of his face

  then rising to her feet with a look of
determination upon her face she found the
hatchet and knocked the cover off the
hatchway below decks everything was
snug and tight groping about in the dark
she found matches and lighted the lantern
which swung from the beam above the
bunk she extended her stiff frozen hands
over the flame and looked about with a
sigh of relief not a drop of water had
the staunch little craft shipped

  returning on deck she dragged the un-
conscious man below dropped him in the
bunk and began to strip him of his wet
garments when she pulled his coarse
prison-shirt over his head she gave a gasp
of horror from the neck to the waist his
back was a mass of horrible bloody bruises

  she knew too well the mark of a cat-o-
nine-tails to be mistaken cords of beaten
flesh lay in livid lines from armpit to arm-
pit he had been brutally whipped with
a sob of mingled rage and compassion she
worked away feverishly and flung the last
of his water-soaked garments on deck
tender-handed and pitying she anointed
his body with healing oil from her locker
and bound up his mangled hands with
strips torn from the blankets

  she forgot race-hatred and prejudice in
administering aid and comfort to the help-
less white-skinned stranger who had come
to her out of the sea bruised and bleeding
she rolled herself into the blankets against
his icy body that the warmth of her youth
might kindle into flame the flickering spark
of life with maiden shyness she drew his
face to her breast and closed her eyes an
indescribable feeling of peace and content-
ment came to her she slept

when she awoke she was alone the
cabin was flooded with warm noon-
tide sunshine the boat swung lazily upon
a calm sunlit sea she heard him move
about on deck wondering she sat up
and looked about before leaving he had
tucked the blankets around her

  she crawled on deck and found him
curled up prison-garbed on the mainsail
with his back against the mast she dared
not lift her eyes for fear of encountering
his he held out his hand and took hers
between his two bandaged ones and raised
it to his lips drinking in the beauty of her
with his clear boyish eyes

  gently withdrawing the hand she knelt
beside him and pressed the spot his lips
had touched shyly to her breast no word
passed from her lips he also was silent
but in his eyes she saw enshrined some-
thing which she dared not believe t-cue

  the youth of him for he was but an
overgrown bearded boy spoke to her own
in youths breathless language tremulous
with awe and exquisite delight at their mu-
tual discovery fiercely her spirit assailed
the barrier of blood and found his amid
the wreckage

  it was no mere mortal love which shone
from the splendor of her face the fire in
her eyes was loves refining flame the
beacon that has guided frail humanity
through the ages in its wingless pursuit of
happiness

  the sea moved inevitably from horizon
to horizon near by a flock of albatrosses
fought over a drifting morsel of food she
remembered then that she had not eaten
since the morning before

  when she placed food and drink from
her locker before him he followed her with
his eyes eating ravenously the while
knowing the scanty supply she ate and
drank sparingly herself heaping his lap
with fruit and sun-cured fish when he
had eaten his fill he drew the sail about
him with a grateful smile and closed his
eyes

  while he slept she tiptoed about repair-
ing the damage done by the storm every
little while she paused in her task to watch
him in silent exultation bending low over
him she touched his cheeks shyly with her
lips and ran her finger-tips lightly through
the gold of his hair

  in the afternoon a strange sail appeared
bearing down upon them with a strong

romance

breeze from the east with a sudden fear
in her heart maina lo recognized the
laiglon the swift brigantine of perrot
the trader

   arousing the fugitive she pointed to the
ship

  it is perrot the french trader she
whispered go below and hide even
now he may have seen you through his

glasses

  the boys face turned white beneath his
tan

  he shall not take me alive sooner
death than the living hell of cayenne

   the girl took his face between her hands

  fear not temasere she said softly
he shall not take you at all dead or liv-
ing but you must hide swiftly

   hastily rigging a jury jib-boom with the
second oar she hoisted the remaining jib
and the mainsail and bore away to the
south storm-beaten and damaged though
she was the little moonbeam staggered
bravely on with anxious eyes maina lo
watched the brigantine grow larger and
larger through his glasses perrot the
trader had recognized her and was driv- n
ing the laiglon off her course in an effort
to overhaul the moonbeam maina lo set
her teeth and prayed for night

  at dark the brigantine was a league
astern gaining rapidly through the
gloom of the tropic night her red and green
beam-lights followed the wake of the
moonbeam like the two evil eyes of a
demon crouching at her oar the girl re-
sorted to every known trick of seacraft in
futile efforts to outmaneuver the french-
man a stones throw to starboard the
great white hull of the brigantine rose out
of the phosphorescent sea a ghostly
avenger following every movement of the
moonbeam

  with a sob of rage and despair maina
lo saw her mainsail flap idly in the breeze
that began to die with the approach of
dawn at daylight the moonbeam and the
laiglon lay a cable-length apart upon the
calm rose-tinged lap of the sea from the
forward davits of the brigantine a boat
was being launched

          maina lo drew from her bosom
the leather sack containing the twelve seed-
pearls and threw them upon the cabin
table she glanced through the open port-

hole at the moonbeam towing in the slug-
gish wake of the laiglon and bit her lip
perrot the trader laughed loudly it was
a cold sinister laugh that seemed to ema-
nate from his flaring hair-studded nostrils

  a pikers bet mademoiselle he
snarled twelve seed-pearls value thirty
francs for your pasty-faced lover sacre-
bleu enjant the government of france
will pay me one thousand francs for him
dead or alive

  the girl choked back a sob

  it is all i have she murmured faintly
msieu will have mercy i will sign a
contract half my earnings for one-nay
two years to come shall be yours i have
found a new bed where the shell i heavy
and pink-edged and there are pearls of
fine luster

  perrot leaned back in his chair and
leered lewdly upon her his bleary pig-
eyes lingered with bestial contemplation
upon her slender lightly garbed form

  the thirteenth pearl mademoiselle he
said smacking his damp lips with an in-
sinuating leer the finest in the world and
i trade take it or leave it a house in
suva fine silks and nothing to do till to-
morrow as the yankees say

  msieu is jesting she whispered 
am still a maid and poor there are
others more beautiful than i have
mercy

  he rose from his chair and took a step
toward her with a look of inexorable
loathing maina lo drew away and turned
her back upon him a hundred feet astern
swung the moonbeam at the end of the
laiglons hawser perrots eyes followed
hers through the porthole upon the deck
two sailors sat turk-fashion guarding the
hatchway smoking their pipes the girl
was hardly aware of the traders presence
she stood looking out to sea with her arms
folded upon her breast

  a rose-tipped ridge of fleecy clouds
framed the young dawn her face grew
radiant carved indelibly upon her soul
stood the runes of loves sacrificial mes-
sage her sacrifice would atone for the
mere carnal sin fragrant and virginal
his white rose should ever rest upon her
heart

  eh bien mademoiselle time is precious
i am waiting perrot growled

  i accept the girl answered in a barely
audible voice

  ah

  the trader drew a breath of surprize and
gratification and placed his hand upon her
arm her flesh cringed beneath the foul
moisture of his palm

  one moment msieu-the terms of
our contract food and water for thirty
days a suit of clothing to replace his
prison-garb a compass a chart and medical
supplies you are to repair the damage
done by the storm and send the ships
blacksmith to strike his fetters

  the trader waved his hand airily

  it shall be done-everything in one
hour your convict shall be as free as the
wind

  he raised his swarthy grinning face to
hers

  one kiss mademoiselle-just one leedle
kiss to seal the bargain

  msieu have a care she panted turn-
ing upon him with the fury of outraged
chastity

  perrot shrank back a cunning look in
his bloodshot eyes

  tres bien ma cherie business before
pleasure-eh what

  taking a bunch of keys from his pocket
he mounted the stairs and locked the com-
panionway door from the outside she
heard him descend the poop-ladder and
order the crew to haul the moonbeam under
the stern quarters

  through the porthole she watched the
ships carpenter fit a new jib-boom in place
of tlje broken one the two sailors fell to
work upon the tangled rigging while others -
lowered the supplies over the side perrot
himself descended the rope-ladder and
threw an old suit of clothes upon the deck

  mademoiselle sends her- best regards
he said maliciously

  the boy steadied himself against the
mast and looked at the bundle blankly

  monsieur had better go below and
change perrot continued the authori-
ties of tahiti might ask embarrassing ques-
tions of one landing there in the garb of a
thief

  the authorities at tahiti the boy
repeated weakly you mean-

  that you are free the trader inter-
posed

  free the boy ejaculated i dont
understand

  the trader shrugged his shoulders

  monsieurs obtuseness is alarming he

sneered i said free a price has been
paid mademoiselle begs me to wish you
a bon voyage

the two men measured each other
across the open hatchway the blue
eyes of the convict grew hard with the
glint of steel his hands moved con-
vulsively at his side he was about to
leap at perrots throat when a sound
above his head caused him to look up

  maina lo with her finger upon her lips
cautioned him from the open porthole un-
observed by the trader or the sailors turn-
ing his back upon perrot the boy picked
up the bundle of clothes and threw it down
the hatchway

  while the blacksmith worked at his
shackles the boy kept his eye on the port-
hole presently a brown hand grasping a
slender fine-toothedsaw was thrust cau-
tiously through the opening fascinated
he watched the saw move back and forth
across the rudder-stock six inches above
the top pintle while the blacksmith per-
spired over the shackles oblivious to every-
thing save his task the saw ate its way into
the oaken rudder-stock slowly relentlessly
minute flour-like particles of sawdust
floated over the heads of the two men on
the rising breeze and were lost in the swirl-
ing wake of the laiglon

  perrot and the sailors had clambered
aboard the brigantine their task finished
only the blacksmith remained the boy
prayed for time in a dozen ingenious
ways he delayed the work of the man

  slowly the gleaming saw-blade sank into
the wood outwardly calm he watched
its progress with his heart pounding madly
against his ribs only an inch of the wood
now remained his task completed the
blacksmith rose tossed the sundered
shackles into the sea picked up his tools
and clambered aboard the laiglon

  son of a thief let go the hawser per-
rot bawled from the waist of the ship as
the boy bent over the forward hawser-bit
to cast off a sudden lurch of the brigantine
swung jhe moonbeam close under the stern
less than four feet from the porthole he
could almost have touched the girls face
so close was he the saw was withdrawn
only the fraction of an inch of the wood
remained

  set the mainsail and stand by to wind-
ward she whispered as his head swept


the freshet

past and the released moonbeam drifted
astern he heard the faint snap of the
parting rudder-stock as he leaped to the
halyards and ran up the mainsail and jib
and hove to

  crouched under the belly of the sail
every nerve alert he saw a brown figure
drop from the porthole of the laiglon and
come plowing hand over hand through the
water toward him the next moment
maina lo dripping with brine swung her-
self on deck from the helpless brigantine

came cries of rage the helmsman spun
the useless wheel in his hands slowly the
disabled craft swung into the wind sails
aback on the bridge beside himself with
rage stood perrot the trader the girl
waved her hand to him

  bon voyage msieu she sang out
twelve seed-pearls you will find in the
sack upon the cabin table the thir-
teenth- she turned her wet radiant face
to the boys-the thirteenth msicu is my
wedding dower au revoir

    the freshet

the river is a green snake
sleeping among snowy hills

stirring on warm days lifting his head

falling asleep again between white hills-

but let him hear the earth-music
of rain walking over plowed fields

of falls talking in the beech forest

of snow slipping down the white hills

the weeping hills-

let him taste ditch-water again

drink it wallow in it

and he will cast his skin

lashing from bank to bank all night

at daybreak

his jaws will be full of brushwood

full of great logs grinding and crunching

dripping with brown slavver

he will throw his mad length about helpless bridges
he will bend down the cottonwoods
and strip them naked

lashing from bank to bank
while the hills weep the white hills

the rain is walking over plowed fields

running to meet him

the hoarse falls shout to him

wild to join him fettered among the beeches

great voices pealing from the white hills

from the weeping hills
earth-music

             conclusion

chapter xxvi

there was days in here that i kind
of forget i remembered mr miller
gave mitch a watch which he had
always promised him and it looked
good but didnt run very well so he was
goin to old abe zemple which was a me-
chanic to fix it but it seemed to run worse
if anything one thing that happened there
was this old zemple had a clock all apart
the wheels and springs scattered all over
the bench mitch saw this and for fun he
put a extra wheel on the bench with the
rest so when old zemple was puttin the
clock together again he couldnt find no
place for this wheel and finally he just left
it out and of course the clock run havin
all the wheels back in it that really be-
longed to it he went around town brag-
gin about puttin a clock together with
one wheel left out and it was just as good
as if it had all the wheels and that showed
that the factory didnt know about clocks

  but it happened that in fixin mitchs
watch old zemple had left out a little pin
just a little pin that you could hardly see
and old zemple found it out and put the

pin in and then the watch run old
zemple told mr miller about leavin the
wheel out of the clock and mr miller
said how do you explain it abe you
leave a big wheel out of a clock and it
runs and you leave a little pin out of a
watch and it wont run somethins
wrong look into it abe for ive
noticed about people that when they try
to get somethin extra into their lives and
fuss around like you did with this wheel
tryin to find a place for it that they dont
need it and do all right without it and on
the other hand other people lose some-
thin so little it dont seem to count and
yet they cant get along without it but
also sometimes a man thinks lies improved
on creation by leavin somethin out of his
life or gettin rid of somethin in society
and it turns out that it didnt belong there
just like this wheel we get fooled a good
deal for you know my boy put that extra
wheel on your bench and then old
zemple said gettin mad-some boys
have lost pins or never had any their
fathers dont raise em up right and mr
miller said this town is just full of
wheels that have nothin to do with the

clock they either belong somewhere else
or they are left overs of other times-like
henry bannerman referring to the man
that spent all day every day walkin up and
down on the stone floor back of the pillars
of the court house

  i want to come back to mitchs watch
but first i remember it was about now that
a troupe came to town playin rip van
winkle and mr miller and my pa took
mitch and me to see it and as we came
back home pa said to mr miller henry
bannerman is a kind of rip van winkle-
a extra wheel-hes been asleep ten years
anyway so mitch and me began to beg
for the story about henry bannerman
which was that he drank until he had a
fever and when he came out of the fever he
was blurred like and not keen like when he
could recite shakespeare and practice law
fine so pa said that onct when henry first
began to practice law again after cornin
out of the fever he had a little office in
the court house and alcibiades watkins
came in to see him about a boundary fence
and sat down and told henry about it
takin about an hour when alcibiades
finished henry says tell it to me over
its a long story and important and i want
to get it right so alcibiades told it over
and then henry says you came to con-
sult me did you alcibiades said yes
well says henry ill have to charge
you-ill have to charge you two dollars
for the advice and so alcibiades took
out two dollars and handed it to henry
and waited for the advice and henry
said well alcibiades i have listened
to you for two hours about this boundary
and the boundary fence and i dont know
a thing about it and my advice to you is
to go and see mr kirby who can under-
stand it and is a good lawyer so alci-
biades said well i know but i came to
you for advice yes said henry i
know you did and i have giv it to you-
go and see mr kirby-hes a good lawyer
and will tell you what more to do and how
to do it you see im not a barrister-
im just a solicitor

  so mr miller and my pa talked which
was as much fun almost as the show they
seemed to know everything and to kind of
stand back of mitch and me next to god
or somethin strong that could keep any
harm away

  but to come back to mitchs watch

george heigold had a piece of lead with
printing letters on one side in copper
they called it a stereotype and it would
print and he wanted to trade mitch for
the watch so he offered his stereotype and
as mitch was crazy about printin and
books mitch traded and was glad of the
chance but when mr miller found it out
he said what did you do that for
that lead stereotype aint worth nothin-
and here you have traded off your watch
which i gave you you know i think you
are goin to be a author-for authors give
their time and everything they have to
print things-and this looks like the key
to your life and a sign of what your life
is goin to be so i think ill begin with
you and put you in the office of the ob-
server to learn the printers trade like
franklin

  of course this stereotype would print
and mitch printed with it a good deal but
as it always printed the same thing the
fun soon died down and mitch really
wished he had his watch back

  so thats how mitch began to set type
and help run a newspaper the editor was
cassius wilkinson and a good deal of the
time he was in springfield and the rest he
was talkin politics or gettin drunk so
that the paper just run itself the foreman
was dutchie bale who used to go to the
farm papers or the chicago papers and just
cut great pieces out of em and set em in
type for the paper and as the editor didnt
care and dutchie didnt care what went
into the paper mitch had a chance to write
for the paper himself and also mr miller
slipped in some wonderful things and
people began to say that the paper was
lookin up while mr wilkinson the
editor smiled and took the compliments
give him just like he deserved em and
onct mitch printed one of his poems about
salem where one of the verses was

      down by the mill where lincoln lived
      where the waters whirl and swish

      i love to sit when school is out
      catchin a nice cat fish

  i dont believe mitch worked in the
newspaper moren a week or ten days but
lots happened and i went down to see him
a good deal to hear dutchie bale talk and
swear he swore awful especially on press
day for the press nearly always broke

romance
mitch miller



down just as they started to print then
dutchie would turn loose

  look at the old corn-sheller look at the
old cider mill look at the junk all the
time puttin in the awfulest profanity
here hes over at springlied and me run-
nin the paper and tryin to print a paper
on a grindstone like this im goin to
quit-ive had enough of this more terri-
ble profanity

  mitch would be standin there half-
scared and half laughin ancf another
printer named sandy bill would be sayin
why dont you tighten that bolt
dutchie then dutchie would crawl
under the press and start to do what sandy
said but findin that the bolt was all right
hed crawl out again and maybe see sandy
kind of laughin so thinkin sandy was
foolin him theyd begin to quarrel and
maybe it would end with dutchie throwin
a monkey wrench at sandy and rushin out
of the room hed come back later for
you couldnt really drive him off the place
and maybe after a hour or two the paper
would be printed

  well mr miller had wrote a long poem
about the indians and he began to print
it and then somethin happened a man
named pemberton which they called the
jack of clubs and a man named hockey
which they called whistlin dick had an
awful fight by the corner store and mitch
wrote up the fight for the paper the editor
bein in springfield and dutchie not ear-
in what was printed mitch called em
human wind-mills and when the paper
came out everybody in town began to
laugh and the papers sold like hot cakes
mr wilkinson was in springfield and had
nothin to do with it but whistlin dick
thought mr wilkinson had written the
piece and put it in so he kept goin to
the depot waitin for mr wilkinson to get
off the train from springfield when he
did which was in a day or two he went
right up to mr wilkinson and hit him and
then proceeded to lick him until he had
enough and got up and ran though he was
sayin all ihe time that he didnt write the
piece- and didnt know nothin about it
then mr wilkinson came to the office and
read the piece and dutchie told him that
mitch wrote it and that ended mitch as
an editor he was afraid to go back to
the office anyway in addition to bein
fired

chapter xxvii

mitch was now a changed boy and
everyone could see it he didnt
come around as much as he used to at
first mr miller set him to work to learn
the printers trade as i have told that
kept him away from me but after he lost
the job still i didnt see him like i used to
i looked -him up a good deal but he was
mostly quiet he didnt want to fish or
to swim or to go out to the farm-he just
read shakespeare and other books lying
in the grass by his house and he wouldnt
come down to see me much because he
said it made him think of little billie
and zueline had gone away with her
mother they said to springfield and if
shed been home mitch couldnt have seen
her anyway i was terribly lonesome with-
out mitch and the days dragged and i
kept hearin of him bein off with charley
king and george heigold and it worried
me

  harold carman had been put in jail and
then let out on bond which held him to
testify in the rainey case and one day
mitch came to me and says im really
caught in this law ive been to see your
pa i thought id told my story once and
that would do but he says therell be a
new jury that never has heard about the
case or what i know and ill have to tell
it all over again and with harold car-
man to tell about their tryin to get him to
say he found a pistol and my story they
can convict temple scott so im caught
and if we had ever so much to do and ever
so much treasure to find or trips to take
id have to put it aside for this here law
and testifyin and if they knew how i
hated it theyd never ask me if i didnt
like it and like makin a sensation and
actin the part of tom sawyer

   pinafore was played at last and we all
went but when my pa sang the merry
merry maiden and the tar mitch got up
and left the hall because as he said to me
afterward it brought back that awful night
when joe rainey was killed it must have
affected others that way too that and the
death of mrs rainey who had a part in
the show for they only played two nights
instead of three which they intended not
enough came to make it worth while

  then one night i went up to see mitch
and the house seemed quieter the girls
edgar lee masters

 

was playin as before but not so wild
mr miller was reading to mrs miller
english history or something but mrs
miller looked kind of like she was tryin
to pay attention she didnt act interested
and happy like she used to mitch told
me then that his pa had been let out of
the church that while we was gone to
st louis the trustees met and decided that
they wanted a minister who would put a
lot of go into the church and get converts
and make things hum that the mortgage
on the church had to be met and they
couldnt meet it without gettin more people
interested in the church and church work
that may have been all true but just the
same everybody said that mr miller was
let go because he preached that sermon
about god bein in everything which he
didnt mean except just as a person talks
to himself he was dreamin like mitch
when he said it

  so mr miller was goin to springfield
to see what he could do about gettin to sell
books or maps or atlases and quit preachin
till a church turned up or preach a little
now and then and marry folks when he
could and preach at funerals i heard mr
miller say to my pa that he was worried
about mitch that mitch talked in his sleep
and ground his teeth and talked about
engines and horses and findin pisols and
treasure and ridin on steamboats and
about zueline and tom sawyer and he
said hed tried to get him to go out to
the farm with me and ride horses and get a
change but he wouldnt he just read
shakespeare until they hid the book and
then they found him readin burns and
once ingersolls lectures which they also
took away because mr miller thought
mitch was too young

  about this time i was about a third
through readin the bible to earn that five
dollars that grandma- had promised me
and mitch asked me what i thought and
i said i didnt understand it much but in
parts it was as wonderful as any book and
mitch says do you know what the bible
is no i says what is it why
he says the bible is the tom sawyer of
grown folks i know that now so i dont
have to go through the trouble of findin
it out after im grown up and depended
upon it for a long while theres the sky
and the earth and there are folks and
were more or less real to each other and

theres something back of it but i be-
lieve when you die youre asleep-sound
asleep-i almost know it and why we
should wake up a bit and then go to sleep
forever is more than my pa knows or any
person in the world knows

  mitch scared me with his talk he was
so earnest and solemn and seemed so sure

  one night when i was up to mr millers
it came up somehow what we was goin to
do when we was grown up-mitch and me
-and mrs miller thought we should be
taught something to earn a livin by and
that the schools instedw of teaching so
much and teaching latin and greek which
nobody used should teach practical things

  and mr miller said look out thats
cornin fast enough its on us already for
back of the schools are the factories and
places that always want workers and
theyre already usin the schools to turn out
workers boys who dont know much or
boys who know one thing and it makes
no difference what happens to me-its
just as much or more to know how to enjoy
life and to enjoy it as it is to be able to
earn a livin if you earn a livin and dont
know how to enjoy life youre as bad off
as if you know how to enjoy life but cant
make a livin or not much of one look
here you boys anything that gives you
pleasure like greek and latin stories his-
tory doin things whatever they are for
the sake of livin are worth while and
you let yourselves go and dont be
moulded into a tool for somebodys use
and lose your own individuality

  and thats the way he talked and then
he said it was all right to dig for treasure
if we wanted to and to want to see the mis-
sissippi river and see tom sawyer and he
didnt blame us a bit for anything we had
done yes he says ill take you to
springfield to-morrow ask your pa skeet
and come along

  i did and the next morning we took the
train for springfield and here was a big
town not as big as st louis but awful
big the capital was biggern any building
in st louis with a great dome and a flag
and mr miller took us out to see lincolns
monument just when we got there two
men in over-alls came running from the
back of the tomb and said a man-an old
soldier-had just killed himself with a
knife so we ran around and found him
lyin in a lot of blood the men came back


mitch miller



and took a bottle of whisky out of his
pocket and a writing which said that the
prohibition party had been defeated and
if it hadnt been he couldnt have got
whisky and so he killed himself because
the prohibition party had been defeated
and mitch says what a fool idea if
he wanted the prohibition party defeated
why did he drink and buy whisky and if
he drank and carried whisky in his pocket
why did he want the prohibition party to
win and kill himself because it lost he
was crazy wasnt he pa

  and mr miller said not necessarily-
thats sense as things go in the world
some people want whisky done away with
so they cant get it their own selves and
when they cant get a law for that it dis-
appoints em and they keep on drinkin
because theyre disappointed or kill them-
selves because their disappointment is too
much for you can depend upon it that
any man that gets his mind too much fixed
on any idea is like a cross-eyed man killin
a steer with a sledge hammer he must hit
whar hes lookin lincoln had a way of
holdin to an idea without the idea drag-
gin him down and away from everything
else

  they had carried the dead man off so
we went into the tomb to see the curiosities
and there was more things than you could
see all kinds of flags and framed things
pictures and writing and show cases with
pistols and all sorts of trinkets bullets
and knives and a pair of spectacles which
lincoln had wore and a piece of a rail he
had split and books hed read and a piece
of ribbon with his blood on it the night
he died and a theatre program and lots of
other things

  then we went out doors and looked up
at the monument and it made me dizzy to
see the clouds sail over the top of it and
there was a figure of lincoln in iron and
of soldiers in iron charging and horses in
iron besides mottoes cut in the stone and
in iron then we went around to the back
again where the old soldier had killed him-
self ttley had the blood wiped up now
so we looked through the iron bars where
a stone coffin was but lincoln wasnt in
there mr miller said for once they had
tried to steal him and got the lead coffin
out and clear down the hill that we could
see but they caught em and after that
they dug way down and put lincoln there

and then poured mortar or concrete all over
him clear up to the top then laid the floor
again and put this marble coffin there
which was a dummy and had nothin in it
so now nobody could get lincoln forever
and ever

  and then we came around in front again
and mr miller looked up at the statue of
lincoln and began to study it and he says
i brought you boys to springfield and out
here to learn and to get things into your
mind youll remember this trip as long as
you live its the first time youve evet
been here and youll be here lots of times
again maybe but youll always remember
this time now just look at lincolns
face and his body and tell me how any-
body could see him and not see that he was
different from other men look how his
face comes out in the bronze and becomes
wonderful and then think if you can how
a handsome face would look in bronze-
just the difference between a wonderful
cliff or mountain side and a great smooth
perfect boulder and yet boys that man
went right around here for twenty years
yes and more all around this town all
around petersburg up at old salem all
over the country practicing law walking
along the streets with people talkin with
em on the corners sittin with em by the
cannon stove in the offices of the hotels
sleepin in the same rooms with em as he
did up at petersburg at the menard house
when the grand jury had the loft and they
put lincoln up there too because there
was no other place to put him

  the menard house says mitch do
you mean that hotel there now

  the very same said mr miller
didnt you know that

  no says mitch

  well that shows you youre like the
people who lived when lincoln did they
didnt know him some of them and now
you dont know the places he went to and
the country he lived in and youd never
have gone to old salem if you hadnl
gone there for treasure-would you
mitch

  mitch said he didnt knowj maybe not

  well said mr miller if you find
lincoln while tryin to dig up a few rotten
dollars its all right anyway now boys
look here it seems an awful time to you
since washington lived since the govern-
ment was founded-but it isnt were all

romance feb - - sjybfflhean


edgar lee masters

here together and when jou get to be old
men youll see that you were bom and
lived in the beginning of the republic
how will it look hereafter do you want
to know-take a history and look at it
now lets see washington had just
been dead ten years when lincol was
born lincoln had been dead eleven years
when you were born when lincoln was
born the government had been founded
just  years was just a little more than of
age it wasnt but just  years old when
lincoln became president why these
figures are nothing think about it when
did juvenal live about  a d when
did virgil and horace live and caesar and
augustus and domitrian what does 
years here or there mean when youre
lookin back over hundreds of years or a
thousand and so i say you boys were
born in the beginning of the republic not
a hundred years after it was started and
if either of you ever get your names into
the history there it will be beside lincoln
and not far from washington-for you
were bom  years after lincoln died and
and not a hundred after washington
well there you are youre young and the
republic is young and the chance is before
you to do for the country and help out for
were havin bad times now and theyll
be worse after every war times is bad
and were goin to have other wars and
worsen ever

  then mr miller said theres two
kinds of men-at least two one that
thinks and one that acts or one that tells
people what to do and others that listen
and do it or else have thought it out first
themselves and do it well look at lin-
coln up there here lffe was over at old
salem running a store surveyin then in
politics a little then a lawyer but mostly
for twenty years he was thinkin about the
state of the country slavery and things
and he thought it all out then they
elected him president and he acted out
what he thought

  well dont you suppose he could have
got rich practicing law or tradin in land
he was a good lawyer-none better why
didnt he get fees and save and buy land
during the twenty years h practiced law
because his mind was set on the country
on how to make the country better on
being a shepherd of the people the man
who thinks of money all the time thinks

of himself and the man who thinks of the
country and wants to help it is thinking of
what can be done for people and how the
country can find treasure in having better
people and better laws and better life
and more of it yes sir boys youll find
somewhere that lincoln said his ambition
was to be well thought of by his fellow
citizens and to deserve to be and it never
occurred to him that he could do that by
gettin money

   dont you boys think im lecturin you
for huntin for treasure or that i want
either of you to grow up and be as poor as
i am i dont i want you to have sense
and provide for yourselves lincoln did
that he really had plenty after he got
fairly started but on the other hand gold
as gold i hate and i see it getting power
in this country why it has it now look
at lincolns face what do you think had
think of whats happened since the war-
the robbery ruin and conquest of the
south the money grabbing and privilege
grabbing at the north the money deals in
new york the money scandals everywhere-
-the treasure hunting everywhere-and
not a big man left in the country none of
the old fine characters left who built their
lives on foundations of wisdom and service
and makin the country better-none of
these left to come forward and take the
country out of the hands of these vultures
wolves hyenas and what are we going to
have is money goin to be the master in
this country or is man goin to be i hate
it-i hate it as lincoln hated it when he
asked whether the dollar or the man should
be put first and i hate it because it is
brainless spiritless it cares for nothing
but itself it is a snake that swallows and
sleeps and wakes to eat again it is a
despot it is without love genius morality
it is against people against god against
the country it is as wicked as nero as
gluttonous as a cotmorant and it makes
cowards slaves lick-spittles of some of the
best of men in this country intended to
be of free men where men could grow and
come to the best that is in them already we
find these laws and principles mocked-by
what by gold by riches and we find
talented men and good men compelled to
step aside for rich men and rich men held
higher than good and useful lawyers
preachers or anything else well theres
lincoln and if never again in the history

romance
mitch miller

of this country a rail-splitter a boy who
worked up from nothing with his hands and
his mind comes to rulership still theres
lincoln on whom no rich man could frown
and no big-bellied capitalist could patronize
or ignore or make step aside why its
great-it makes me happy it gives me
hope and i can see for ages and ages the
face of lincoln on books on coins on
monuments until some day his face will be
the symbol of the united states of amer-
ica when the united states of america has
rotted into the manure piles of history with
tyre and babylon as it will if it doesnt
turn back and be what lincoln was a man
who worked and thought and whose idea
was to have a free field just laws and a
democracy where to make a man and not
make a dollar is the first consideration
and then mr miller said yes this is
a great monument and lincoln was a great
man you see when all the sap-heads and
poets down in new england and all over
was hollerin for nigger equality and to give
the nigger a vote and to marry him and
give him the same right as anybody lin-
coln just kept cool and he didnt even
emancipate the nigger until he had to in
order to win the war it was to win the
war understand he wasnt swept off his
feet by anybody orators or poets or yawp-
ers-nobody but youll see when you
grow up what the difference is between not
havin the nigger for a slave and allowin
him to vote and marry you and youll see
that what lincoln said when he went over
the country debatin with dquglas speakin
at havana and right here in springfield
and at petersburg too he said to the last
and acted on to the last it was after the
war and after lincoln was dead that these
here snifflers and scalawags got into power
and pushed it over until they gave the
nigger the vote and all that and if this
country goes to pieces because the good
breeds have been killed off and die off and
the country is run by the riff-raff then
lincoln say  years from now will stand
greater than he is to-day unless the world
can then see that the nigger should have
been kept a slave so as to let the wise and
the intelligent have time to think better
and work better for the good of the coun- -
try for boys you can put it down that a
country aint good that is run on the prin-
ciple of countin noses and lettin every-
body have a say just because he walks on

two legs and can talk instead of bark-
in or waggin his tail and so mr miller
went on

  then miller said damn or that something-
could be dammed and mitch says
pa did you know you swore and mr
miller says i shouldnt have and dont
you follow my example but sometimes i
get so mad aboutthe country

  so we had seen the monument and
walked away and when we got a long way
from it we turned around and looked at it
for the last

  then mr miller said he was glad he was
out of the church that he had tried to do
certain things but they wouldnt let him
and kept him in a groove and now he was
going to sell atlases and geographies and
be a free man and maybe write a book
and he said the idea seems to be that
goodness spirituality is church it isnt
and it never was it wasnt when the savior
came he found goodness and spirituality
in a lot of things in a free life in the free-
dom of out-doors and not in the syna-
gogues now boys believe in the bible
in the savior-i mean that but dont let
that belief make you into a membership
with those who live for denial for obser-
vation of injunctions for abstinence from
life more or less for solemnity for re-
ligion as business and business as religion
and religion for husiness this is not good-
ness-not spirituality lincoln was good
and spiritual-he believed in the mind and
he used it wisdom beauty play adven-
ture friendship love fights for the right
and for your rights travel everything
anything that keeps the mind going and
kindness generosity hospitality laughter
trips down the mississippi making cities
beautiful and clean having fun-all these
things are spirituality and goodness they
are religion-they are the religion of the
savior they will make america and
they ought to be americanism

  so mr miller went on i cant remem-
ber half he said but it was plain he was
worked up losin his church or some-
thing had set his thoughts free and every-
thing considered i think he wanted to give
us some ideas about things and so after
lookin at lincolns home a frame house
not very big not fine but a good house
and lookin at the furniture and things he
had we took the train back to petersburg
edgar lee masters

chapter xxviii

i could see plainer and plainer that i
was losin mitch there was some-
thing about having this business together
of huntin for treasure that kept us chums
and now that was over and if we didnt
get something else where would we end
up mitch said that the trip to spring-
field had cured him of being mad at his pa
for takin us to hannibal to see tom saw-
yer the butcher and he said suppose
you was at old salem fishin and you had a
can of worms for bait or thought you had
and you was really out of worms which
would be better to set there and think you
had bait and go on believin that until you
began to catch fish and needed lots of bait
and found you hadnt none or to find out
you hadnt none all of a sudden and then
go get some in time for the fishin that got
good and so wasnt it better to find out
that tom sawyer didnt live and find it out
suddenly than to go along being fooled
until something serious happened and be
a fool to the end and maybe lose some
good chance what i wanted to tell
mitch was that our case was real that we
had found treasure and would get it on
christmas but i had promised my pa i
wouldnt tell and i didnt i only said
to mitch were just as sure to get treas-
ure as the sun shines and mitch said
maybe but not real treasure not money
not jewels or things like that

  as i said i was surely losin mitch for
he was goin considerable now with charley
king and george heigold i dont know
what he found with them to like only they
were older and as it turned out he did
things wifh them that he and  never did

i tried my best to hold on to him but
couldnt sometimes id think i wasnt
losin him that it was just fancy just the
same things wasnt the same the miller
family wasnt the same there wasnt as
much fun up there and now mr miller
was away a good deal selling atlases and
sometimes when i was there of evenings
mrs miller would be sittin alone no one
reading to her and the girls kind of walkin
the rooms and mitch a good deal away of
evenings not home like he always was
before

  you see i had a pony all the time but
pa loaned him here and there and some-
times took him out to pasture across the

river to a farmers and thats how it was i
didnt ride him sometimes out to the farm
but now he was in the barn and as i
didnt have mitch i rode about the country
by myself and once went out to the farm
for a few hours coinin back to town in a
gallop all the way to see how quick i could
make it

  finally i thought id go out to the farm
on my pony and stay for a few days and
go camping with my uncle over to blue
lake i was goin the next day and was out
under the oak tree when mitch came along
he seemed stronger bigger more like
charley king and george heigold there
was something about him kind of hard
he seemed as if hed fight easier he was
quick to talk back he seemed to be learnin
about things i didnt know there was a
different look in his eyes he was changed
thats all i know mitch sat down in the
grass and began to make traps out of tim-
othy lo catch crickets somebody had
taught him that his face began to change
he began to look friendlier and like him-
self again except he looked older and like
he knew more and then he began to
talk

  skeet he says im not tom sawyer
and i never was never any more than you
was huckleberry finn i know who i am
now do you

  no says i who are you

  well ill tell you skeet-im hamlet
  hamlet-who was he

  well says mitch he was a prince
  well you aint says i

  no i aint but hamlet could be just
like me and not be the preachers son and
because he wasnt wouldnt make him dif-
ferent yes sir im hamlet ive read
the play and thought about it a lot and
i know now who i am and you skeet
are horatio

  who was he says i

  he was hamlets friend just as you
are my friend and as far as that goes
there was never any persons more alike in
this world than you and horatio you are
good and steady and dont change and
you are a good friend you have got sense
and you have no troubles of your own and
so you can listen to mine as horatio lis-
tened to hamlets

  what troubles have you says i

 lots says mitch that is general
troubles-of course zueline and this here

i	  romance
mitch m

court worries ive got to testify again
im tangled up just like hamlet was and
i want to get away like he did and i cant
and it teaches me that it aint because im
a boy that i cant get away for hamlet
was a man and he couldnt he was get-
ting old most  and he couldnt do any
more with his life than i can with mine-
not as much maybe

  and yet you say he was a prince

  yes but what difference did that make
did you ever see a chip get caught in a
little shallow in the river in the reeds and
then see it get out of the shallow by the
current changing or something and then
see it start down the river all gay and free
and run into some brush floating or get
thrown against the logs to one side of the
dam and held there well hamlet was a
prince and he was just a chip caught by
the dam and couldnt budge and kept tryin
to and couldnt this is what my pa says
the play means but also i can see it for
myself i keep readin it and it gets clearer
and pa says it will never make any differ-
ence how old i get the play will be won-
derfuler and wonder fuler and is to him
and that finally ill wonder how any man
could ever write such a thing

  but didnt shakespeare-he wrote it
didnt he-get it out of some history

  of course says mitch and didnt
lincoln live and right here in this town
as you might say but suppose somebody
could write up lincoln and use the very
things that lincoln did and said not as we
hear em around here wonderful as they
are but write em up so that youd know
what lincoln really was and why and all
about it for that matter take doc lyon
we know he was a lunatic but why and
what for and just what it means to be a
lunatic i dont know and no one will know
until some shakespeare writes him up for
that matter some folks think that hamlet
was a lunatic

  well you aint mitch says i

  no more than hamlet was he just
was troubled and his mind kept workin
and thats me but what would you say
if i was the son of joe rainey and mrs
rainey

  how do you mean says i

  well suppose i was their son and sup-
pose i knew that mrs rainey my mother
wanted joe rainey my father dead and
put it into temple scotts mind to kill my

roma

i l l e r	

father joe rainey and then temple
scott did kill him and then mrs rainey
my mother put a pistol down so as to
make it seem that my father joe rainey
had carried a pistol suppose i was their
son and was up in the tree and saw what
i saw what would i do

   then youd have to testify said i
you dont know what youre sayin
skeet you dont see that i love my father
and hes been murdered and i love my
mother and she has really murdered him
and if i testify against my mother i get
her hanged and if i dont testify against
her then i wrong my father that i love
my mother goes free and sometimes i hate
her because she is free and my father has
been robbed of his life and i do nothing
to punish her and temple scott for taking
his life away thats the worst of it or
maybe its just as bad because im tangled
in law and cant do what i want to do-
cant be free to hunt treasure well say
or do what i want to dont you see what
a fix im in then suppose with findin
out what my mother is the whole world
changes for me-i get suspicious of my girl
and wont marry her and everything goes
bad and finally i get killed myself after
killin temple scott whos married my
mother well say and in a way cause my
mother to die too

   well of course all this cant be says
i for youre not the raineys son-
theyre both dead anyway and temple
scott will probably be hanged and no one
will kill you-youll grow up and get mar-
ried-not to zueline-

  no says mitch never to her for i
aint suspicious of her-im just done with
her just like hamlet was done with
ophelia i know her as he knew ophelia
though shes different from ophelia shes
cold skeet and never understood me i
see that now if she had shed never let
her mother keep her away from me
nothin can keep a girl away from you that
loves you and ill tell you something
right now not long ago i was walkin
by her house on purpose and she came out
goin somewhere i tried to talk to her
and tell her that we could meet sometimes
maybe down at fillmore springs or take a
little walk at dusk or early evening and
that i wouldnt bother her much only wed
understand that by and by wed get mar-
ried and be together forever and id go
away happy if i could have that hope
well she kind of turned on me and said
no and hurried on and skeet when i
saw that when i saw that it was her as
well as her ma that wanted me away and
meant to keep away from me-something
kind of froze through me-or burned may-
be and then froze-my heart got like a big
stone and i could see it just as if it had
been scalt and then turned white and shiny
and kind of numb like my foot- i cut in
two i began to laugh and since then i
have been changed and ill never be the
same again my ma said it was foolish
that i was just a little boy and id grow
up and it would all be forgotten but i
know better-im hamlet-and i dont
forget and i never will do you remember
one time when you and i was out to your
grandpas farm and willie wallace was
settin out trees

   i said yes

  well says mitch willie wallace
that time cut a gash in a tree with the
pruner while handlin it and settin it out
and he says to us that tree will never
get over that by and by it will be a big
scar growin big as the tree grows big
and grown over maybe but still a scar or
worse it may stay open more or less and
rain and frost will get in and insects and
after while it will be a great rotten place
a hole for a snake or a rat or maybe a
bird well pa says that linkern lost anne
rutledge and that he thinks linkerns beau-
tiful talk and wonderful words came from
losin anne rutledge i dont quite see
how-but if it did then if a bird gets into
the hole in the tree thats a sign that you
say somethin or write somethin because
youve been gashed just as pa says that
shakespeare wrote his wonderfulest plays
and sonnets because hed lost a woman
and sometimes i think im goin to write
something i keep hearin music all the
time and i try to write words down but
they dont mean anything they are silly
so  tear em up

  so mitch went on and he worried me
and i says mitch im goin to say
something to you do you like me as
much as you used to

  every bit says he why
because says i you dont always act
the same and besides you keep goin
with charley king and george heigold-
and-and- 

and what says mitch

and-i was afraid you liked em bet-
tern me

why says mitch them two boys is
just grave diggers compared to you-or
rosencrantz and guilderstern-while you
are horatio all the time

he explained to me what he meant by
this which was that in hamlet ha ml at
talked to grave diggers and to two men
named rosencrantz and guilderstern
without givin a snap for em compared to
horatio

then i said im goin out to the farm
to-morrow school will begin in about
three weeks im goin out on my pony
and you can ride behind and youd bet-
ter come well have a lot of fun and my
uncle is goin to take me campin to blue
lake so mitch said hed go and after a
bit he began to repeat something hed
committed to memory like this

o	what can ail thcc knight at arms

       alone and palely loitering

      the sedge is withered from the lake

      and no birds sing

	what can ail thee knight at arms

so haggard and so woe-begone

       the squirrels granary is full

      and the harvest done

      	met a lady in the mead
      full beautiful a faerys child

      her hair was long her foot was light

      and her eyes were wild

      i saw pale kings and warriors too

       pale princes death pale were they all

      they said la belle dame sans merci
      hath thee in thrall

mitch was goin on with this when we
heard some boys whistle it was charley
king and george heigold they called
mitch to the fence and talked then
mitch called back and said im goin
skeet-come for me-what time

ill be up about  i said

and mitch climbed over the fence and
went with these boys

i went up to the fence and follered them
with my eyes till they turned the corner
by harris barn and was gone

chapter xxix

the next morning i was on my pony
and up to mitchs house at  and
whistled and whistled by and by one of
m  tch

the girls came out and said mitch had staid
all night at charley kings and wasnt
home yet so i went over there but he
and charley was up and gone already mrs
king came to the door came out and stood
by the pony and petted him and said i had
pretty eyes same as before then she said
charley and mitch had gone somewhere
she didnt know where so i rode off and
rode around a bit and then i started for the
farm thinkin that mitch had treated me
mean-and why would he for rosencrantz
or guilderstern whichever charley king
was i was sure mitch would turn up and
the next day grandpa was goin to town
early to be home by three oclock and he
said hed bring mitch out if he could find
him

  my uncle now was in a mood to go
camping to blue lake so we got the tent
out and began to mend it where it needed
it and fix the ropes we took the guns
and cleaned em and i helped my uncle
load a lot of shells we set aside some pie
plates and cups and did a lot of tinkerin
around grandma didnt want us to go
she was afraid wed get drowned or shoot
ourselves or that a storm would come up
and wed get struck by lightning

  in the afternoon old washington engle
came and lie and grandpa sat under the
maple trees and talked old times even
about indians for they had been in the
black hawk war together and they had
seen the country grow from buffalo grass
to blue grass and clover i sat there lis-
tenin and pretty soon a buggy pulled up
and somebody called in a loud voice and
laughed it was john armstrong and aunt
caroline they had drove over to visit
and john had brought his fiddle to play
some of the old things for grandma-some
of the things he had played year before
when aunt mary was sick and grandma
was takin care of her grandpa liked
gospel tunes like swing lo sweet
chariot but grandma liked rocky road
to jordan and the speckled hen and
john could play these and couldnt play
religious tunes worth a cent and john
told stories as before and he told about a
man at oakford who never had any money
and always wanted drinks so he took a
jug and filled it half full of water and went
to porky j im thomas saloon and asked for
a half a gallon of alcohol and porky jim
poured it in then this man said to porky

miller	

jim charge it please and porky jim
says why you aint got a cent and you
never pay anybody so he took up the
jug and poured out what he had poured in
and told the man to take the jug and go
and he did and had of course a half gallon
all mixed john laughed terribly at his
own story-the women didnt laugh nor
grandpa my uncle did and i thats all

  then aunt caroline helped grandma get
supper and we had a lot of fun and they
drove home

  the next day grandpa started early for
petersburg so as to be back by three
oclock for something and my uncle and
me was getting ready because we was goin
to drive to blue lake that night pitch the
camp and fish while it was quiet so we
had to grease the wagon and do a lot of
things and grandpa was to bring mitch

  three oclock looked like it never would
come but at last about three i saw the
white horses on the far hill and then i saw
them pulling hard and slow up the near
hill and i could see grandpa now but
couldnt see mitch and i watched and
looked then i thought he was hid under
the seat or had dropped off to walk and
come in later and fool me

  grandpa drove in the lot his face was
set he looked serious he didnt look
at me he held the lines and looked
straight ahead i climbed on the carriage
and says wheres mitch just then
my uncle came up to unhitch the horses
my grandpa threw him the lines and grand-
pa got out of the carriage then he said
speaking really to my uncle and not to me
mitchie miller was killed this afternoon
on the railroad

  grandpa i cried grandpa

  my grandfathers eyes were purple-
they had grown deep and almost terrible
to see and he said yes son and hur-
ried toward the house

  i went to the barn i saddled and
bridled my pony i leaped into the saddle
and struck my heels into the ponys flanks
and away i went in a run all the way to
petersburg-six miles and not a pause or a
let up

  when i got there in a little more than
half an hour i found that they had mitch
up at the house of widow morris so i
went there he was still alive-and they
let me in it was terrible such a smell of
ether-medicines such whisperings-such

j romance l
edgar lee masters

fulness in the room the doctor said wed
have to clear out some of us and some
left i staid long enough to see mitch
his eyes were closed his face was yellow
-i could see blood i turned siek and
went out of the room just as i got to the
door i heard mitch say has pa come
they said hes cornin mitchie be
patient hes cornin then i stood by the
door

  and pretty soon mrs miller came and
the girls and my mother and myrtle and
most everyone it seemed mr miller was
away selling atlases but would be home
soon maybe or maybe not till late and
maybe not till to-morrow all the girls
cried like their hearts would break and
mrs miller knelt down by the bed and
mitch says to her wheres pa and she
says hes coinin mitchie and then
she choked and had to walk away they
cleared the room now pretty much and of
course mrs miller allowed me to be in the
room if i wanted to and could stand it
but i stood by the door or just inside a
little for mitch was talkin finally they
let me go to the bed-side and mitch saw
me and says skeet and then turned
his head kind of over as if he wanted to
say something he couldnt bear to say

  then mitch began to talk more dont
row so fast hed say-the rivers gettin
swifter take the horses from that engine
im goin to see tom sawyer-i can fly to
him-fly-fly-fly-zueline-its you is
it

  then he kind of woke up and says is
zueline here and they said no but
she was cornin but she wasnt she was
out of town and probably wouldnt have
come anyway and then he said- get
my pa-he must forgive me before i die

  by this time i knew how mitch was
hurt hed been with charley king and
george heigold and they had been fiippin
on the train and mitch was ridin on the
side of a car with his foot hangin down
that he had cut in two draggin against the
wheel which he didnt notice because his
foot was numb from being cut in two when
he was four or five years old so the train
gave a lurch and dragged him under and
the wheels cut him at the hip it couldnt
be amputated by the doctor and they
couldnt slop the bleedin

  then mitch began to repeat all kinds of
poetry from hamlet and things i didnt

know and he repeated what he had recited
tp me that day

       i saw pale kings and warriors too

       pale princes death pale were they all

      they said la belle dame sans merci
      hath thee in thrall

  and he talked about fly in about treas-
ure about st louis about doc lyon and
joe rainey and the pistol and once he
talked as if he thought he was testifyin in
court and he said- now were on the
mississippi-how fast the boat goes-dont
run so fast but always hed come to and
say wheres my pa

  and after a bit there was a stir-mr
miller came-pushed his way through
he was pale as ashes all trembling out of
breath for hed run up the hill and he
came to the bedside but mitch was dream-
ing again drifting and dreaming and talk-
ing about boats about money about ham-
let about treasure about pale kings and
warriors and death pale princes but
pretty soon he says wheres my pa is
he never cornin

  im here said mr miller

  mitch opened his eyes and looked at
his father for about a minute and saw his
pa had come he was pretty weak now and
it was hard for him to speak jbut finally
he said take my hand-pa and mr
miller took it and then nothin was said
for a while and then mitch spoke again-
forgive me pa and mr miller who
was tryin to keep from cryin so as not to
worry mitch says oh yes mitchie
and then mitch says say a little prayer
pa and mr miller knelt by the bed to
say a prayer and mitch says- not out
loud-just to yourself

  so mr miller did and then mitch wan-
dered again and he says dont row so
fast then there was a terrible stillness
mitch had died with them words

  and my friend-my chum was gone for
good

chapter xxx

and then there was the funeral it
was held at mr millers house and
everybody was there my grandpa my
grandma my uncle john armstrong and
aunt caroline willie wallace col lamb-
kin nigger dick dinah my ma and
myrtle all the sunday school children and
mitc h

george montgomery only charley king
and george heigold wasnt there they
were afraid bein partly responsible for
mitchs death and when everybody was
seated and ready zueline and her ma came
they was all dressed up and everybody
looked at em mr miller of course
couldnt preach the sermon for his own
boy so they sent for a wonderful preacher
over at jacksonville and he talked for
about an hour about pearly gates and the
golden streets of paradise and there was
mitch lyin there pale his eyes sealed just
asleep but in such a deep breathless sleep
and they had the church choir there which
sang

i will sing you a song of that beautiful land

of the far away home of the soul

where no storms ever beat on that glittering
     strand

while the years of eternity roll

  and the minister went on to say how
good god was how no sparrow falls except
he knows it how all our hairs was num-
bered and how god loves us and would
comfort the father and mother and brothers
and sisters and little friends and how if
it hadnt been for the best mitch wouldnt
have died and that god knew best and
we didnt and if we could look ahead and
see the dreadful things that would happen
wed know that god was good and wise to
take mitch away before they happened-
while he was yet a boy and had had no
trouble and all the world was still beauti-
ful to him and he talked about sin and
what suffering does for people how it
makes em humble before god and respect-
ful and at last saves em if they will heed
the lessons and turn to god everybody
cried when the last song was sung espe-
cially the children who sobbed out loud
and mr miller and mrs mitterrand the
mifler children-and i looked over at
zueline and her ma her ma was just
lookin down i thought i saw a tear in
zuelines eyes but im not sure so we
went out to the cemetery and they buried
mitch not far from little billie so it was
all over we began to separate and get
into carriages or walk and pretty soon i
was home thare was nothing there my
ma went in and began to do something
myrtle went out to the swing i went in
the house but couldnt stand it and then
came out and hung on the gate

miller	

  after a bit charley king came along and
asked me about everything pa said mitch
had been running with charley king and
george heigold and they got him into
things too much for his age flippin cars
and such things and thats how mitch lost
his life you see id been scared about
this i didnt want mitch to go with em
i didnt know why but now it was clear

  and with everything else it was sunday
for mitch had died friday four or five
hours after he was run over and it was
only a week now till school would take up

  the next day i went down to the office
with pa i wanted to be close to him he
was a man he was strong and i was lone-
some and grievin and at night always
dreamin of mitch and after a while mr
miller came in and mrs miller too they
locked terrible sad and pale here was
mr miller out of a church and not makin
much and here they had lost their only
boy

  so pa went over to his safe and got the
 he had it in two envelopes one
marked with my name and one with
mitchs and he came back holdin em
in his hand and he said you know that
these boys found that money that belonged
to old nancy allen well a fellow named
joe allen turned up here from pike county
-a third cousin of hers-and her only liv-
in relative and i had this money for him
but when i told him that these boys had
found it while lookin for treasure and
what kind of boys they were the old fellow
remembered his own boy-hood hispoverty
and all that and he wanted to do something
for these boys so he made me take this
thousand dollars to divide between em
mrs miller began to sob and mr mil-
lers voice was broken but he said hard
i never heard anything like this-never in
my life- well heres the money says
pa and i made skeet promise not to tell
anybody about it until we got ready to
he stopped and i not thinkin said it
was to be a secret till christmas

  then mrs miller broke down com-
pletely and for several minutes nothin
was said my pa was cryin so was i
so was mr miller and just then the train
came in the same that had killed mitch
and it semed like none of us could stand it

  after a bit pa says of course half
of this money goes to you and mrs miller
under the law and the other half belongs
edgar lee masters

to sket-but im not going to let him take
it he doesnt need it i can always take
care of him and ill inherit quite a lot and
hell have that and as far as that goes it
wasnt his idea to hunt for treasure-he
was just a helper and followed up mitchies
idea so now here it is and it goes with my
blessing and with skeets

  and i said indeed it does and pa
handed the envelopes to mr miller and he
took em and fingered em in a nervous way
and he says what shall we do ma-we
need the money but somehow i dont like
it and i wont take skeets share would
you

  and she says no-never-id never
take skeets share that is mitchies share
and his too here he says heres the
envelope marked with mitchies name you
take this skeet because you and mitchie
worked together and if you want to give
me the envelope marked with your name i
guess ill take it-i seem to have to

  so thats the way it was done and he
said to pa hard there never was a
better man than you or a better name or
family than yours or a better boy than
skeet then the tears came in his eyes
and he and mrs miller left and after-
wards i said to pa i dont want this
money if i could have had it with mitch
if we could have spent it together for veloci-
pedes-and dogs and sets of tools for
scroll saws watches and whatever we
wanted and soda water when we wanted
it and bananas which we never had much
because they cost ten cents a piece-for
amfthing that would have been different
but now its just so much rags or paper
and i havent got any use for it whatever
i am huck finn at last-the money means
nothing to me it meant nothing to huck
because when he got it he had to put on
shoes and dress up and now ive got it
ive lost the only thing that made it worth
while ive lost mitch who made it inter-
estin to get and would have made it in-
terestin to spend

  then i told pa i wanted to give it to the
miller girls barrin just a few dollars to
buy a present for ma and grandma and
myrtle maybe-and i wanted them to take
enough to put up a stone at mitchs grave
with some words on it suitable to him

 so pa said he thought that was all right
and i took out  and we put the rest in

the bank in the names of the miller girls-
and that ended the treasure

  so next monday school commenced and
i sat in my seat lookin out of the window
zueline had been taken to a girls school in
springfield so as to get her out of the com-
mon schools and her mother had gone with
her to stay all winter and every day the
train came through that mitch was killed
on the days went by the fall went by
the winter came the snow began to fall
on mitchs grave and little billies and
still we went on delia got the meals as
before the wash woman came and did the
washing on monday pa was buying wood
for the stoves we had to be fitted out for
winter grandma and grandpa came in to
see us cheerful and kind as they always
were once he carried a half a pig up the
hill and brought it to us and they were
always giving us things and grandma was
always knitting me mittens and socks
they had lost a lot of children two little
girls the same summer a daughter who was
grown a grown son who was drowned
they seemed to take mitchies death and
little billies death as natural and to be
stood and they said it wouldnt be long
before wed all be together never to be
separated and then wed all be really
happy

  and finally the december court came
around and they tried temple scott har-
old carman testified to what he had said
to the woman on the boat and major
abbott was kerflumxed and lost the case
temple scott got  years in prison-and
that ended that he went there and staid

  and then christmas came and in the
evening i went up to the millers the
girls were playing about the same as be-
fore mr miller was reading shakespeare
to mrs miller and he looked up finally and
said ma ive just thought of an epitaph
for mitchies stone-here it is in hamlet
the rest is silence  and mrs miller
said yes and put her knitting down to count
stitches the girls rushed into the room
laughing and chasing each other and
then i went home

  i had presents but what were presents
my chum was gone i thought of the last
christmas when we was all together-
mitch was here then and little billie i
couldnt enjoy anything i crept up to bed
and fell asleep and dreamed of mitch

mr masters epilogue to mitch miller is published on the opposite page in the meeting-place

----the end
the meeting-place

here is the epilogue to edgar lee
masters mitch miller

  perhaps it should have been printed on
the opposite page as a part of the final
instalment but it seemed to be so personal
in content and to explain so clearly mr
masters reasons for writing the story that
we felt it really belonged in the meeting-
place which is after all only the glance
of an eye away 

  you will be surprized to know how i
came to write this story but before
i tell you that i want to say that if mitch
had written it it would have been much
better i sit here dipping my nose in the
gascon wine so to speak as thackeray
wrote of himself and i know now that
mitch was a poet he would have made
poems out of his life and mine beautiful
songs of this country of illinois of the
people we knew of the honest kindly men
and women we knew the sweet-faced old
women who were born in kentucky or ten-
nessee or came here to illinois early in their
youth the strong courtly old fashioned
men carrying with them the early traditions
of the republic in their way lincolns-
honest truth telling industrious courageous
americans-plain and unlettered many of
them but full of the sterling virtues yes
he would have written poems out of these
people and he would have done something
more-he would have given us symbols
songs of eternal truth of unutterable
magic and profound meaning like la belle
dame sans merci i am sure he would
have done something of this kind-though
it is idle to say he would have written any-

thing as immortal as that you must only
indulge me in my partiality for mitch and
my belief in his genius and hope with me
that he might have done these great things

  and yet and now why did i write this
story as i was sitting with my nose in
the gascon wine which is a strange figure
since there is no gascon wine here and no
wine of any sort since a strange sort of
despot has got control of the country for
the time being only i hope-as i said as
i was sitting with my nose in the gascon
wine i was also reading and i was alone

i	have had chums i have had companions
but none like mitch never in all my life
and being alone i was reading-what do
you suppose i had been out for the eve-
ning i had found a book lying on the
table of my host i had looked in the book
and begun to read my host saw i was
intrigued and said take it along i did
and was reading before going to bed the
book was the letters of john keats to
fanny brawne- well dont you sup-
pose these letters made me think of mitch
who had repeated la belle dame sans
merci to me and was uttering some of its
marvelous lines with his dying breath
but this was not all let me quote one of
keats letters to fanny brawne

  when you were in the habit of flirting with
brown you would have left off could your own
heart have felt one half of one pang mine did
brown is a good sort of man-he did not know
he was doing me to death by inches i feel the
effect of every one of those hours in my side
now and for that cause though he has done
me many services though i know his love and
friendship for me though at this moment i
should be without pence were it not for his


i

the meeting-place

assistance i will never see or speak to him until
we are both old men if we are to be i will
resent my heart having been made a football
you will call this madness i have heard you
say that it was not unpleasant to wait a few
years-you have amusements-your mind is
away-you have not brooded over one idea as
i have and how should you you are to me
an object intensely desirable-the air i breathe in
a room empty of you is unhealthy i am not the
same to you-no-you can wait-you have a
thousand activities-you can be happy without
me any party any thing to fill up the day has
-been enough how have you passed this month
whom have you smiled with  all this may seem
savage in me you do not feel as i do-you do
not know what it is to love-one day you may-
your time is not come ask yourself how many
unhappy hours keats has caused you in loneli-
ness for myself i have been a martyr the
whole time and for this reason i speak the con-
fession is forced from me by the torture i ap-
peal to you by the blood of christ you believe
in do not write to me if you have done any-
thing this month which it would have harried
me to have seen you may have altered-if you
have not-if you still behave in dancing rooms
and other societies as i have seen you-i do not
want to live-if you have done so i wish this
coming night may be my last i cannot live
without you and not only you but chaste you
virtuous you the sun rises and sets the day
passes and you follow the bent of your inclina-
tions to a certain extent-you have no concep-
tion of the quantity of miserable feeling that
passes through me in a day-i-be serious love is
not a plaything-and again do not write unless
you can do it with a crystal conscience i would

sooner die for want of you than-

yours forever

  then i turned back a few pages in my
disconnected way of reading this book and

i	found these words fanny brawne to
whom this agonized letter of keats was
written wrote to a mr dilke ten years
after keats death in regard to a memoir
proposed to the dead and in the following
unconcerned and ignorant way

  the kindest act would be to let him rest for-
ever in the obscurity to which circumstances have
condemned him

no remembrance here for keats adora-
tion no thrill that a human heart even if
it had been the heart of an ordinary man
had poured out its last devotion to hers
no pity for his obscurity if it was such
his untimely and tragic death no recogni-
tion of his passion for beauty including his
misguided passion for the beauty which
was not in her no perception of the good-
ness in the man the bravery of his heart

the white fire of his spirit no understand-
ing of his greatness even after byron had
written that hyperion was as sublime as
aeschylos and shelley had poured out in
adonais the grief and the passion of a
flaming indignation and scorn in one of the
greatest of elegies no memory contemplat-
ing the agony of a dying youth stricken
with consumption and torn with the tragic
spectacle of defeated ambition let him
rest forever in the obscurity to which cir-
cumstances have condemned him-these
were her words in the face of all these
things

  and so reading these words of fanny
brawne my mind turned back to mitch
and his life rose before me and took shape
in my mind and i wrote just because he
had had this boyhood love for zueline and
went through that summer of torture for
losing her and i could see that he might
have suffered these pangs again that over
and over again perhaps he might have
poured out his passion in the endless search
for beauty and faith and in the search for
realization and glimpses of eternal things
through them and that he would have
never found them through woman and so
thinking i could look back upon his death
at twelve years of age with complacency
and almost with gladness

  but also if he had lived through as many
years as i have lived he would have passed
through the chaos the dust the hate the
untruth that followed the civil war he
would have seen an army organization exer-
cising a control in the affairs of the republic
beyond its right and ideas that were dead
and were never rightfully alive keeping the
people of his country from pulling them-
selves out of poverties and injustices and
from planting themselves upon the new soil
of each succeeding year and its needs he
would have seen wealth amass through
legalized privilege into the hands of treas-
ure hunters and he would have seen these
treasure hunters make and interpret the
laws their own way and in behalf of the
treasure they had and were seeking he
would have seen his country go forth to
free an island people and then turn and
subjugate another island people as a part
of the same war and then depart from the
old ways ito paths of world adventure and
plunder and he would have seen his
country spend ten times what it spent in
the civil war and lose in battles or disease

r omance
the meeti

half as many young men as it lost in the
civil war in the crusade of making the
world safe for democracy and he would
have seen democracy throttled and almost
destroyed at home and democracy abroad
helped no whit by this terrible war he
would have seen that all these things hap-
pen for treasure-for gold which cares
nothing for laws nothing for liberties noth-
ing for beauty nothing for human life but
always seeks its own everywhere and al-
ways which is its own increase and its own
conservation he would have seen men
jailed for nothing and sacred rights swept
away by the sneers of judges and written
safe guards of the peoples liberties by those
very judges sworn to support overthrown
by them at the bidding of treasure hunters
who stand back of hired orators hired
newspapers hired clergymen hired law-
yers and hired officials he would have
seen congresses uttering and acting upon
lies and his country bound together with a
net-work of elaborate falsehood

  the america his father hoped for and
the america he would have hoped for sits
for the time-being anyway in dullness and
in dust and so i am not sorry that for
these nearly thirty years mitchie miller
has been dust a part of the hill overlooking
the sangamon river not far from the de-
serted village of old salem-his dust at
one with the hill and sharing its own
eternity

edgar lee masters

maybe some of you canadians once
knew the principal character in
ramsey bensons story

wlshart mo

  the original of blackstock in whom the
lord ioveth was an english minister who quit
the ministry for his healths sake and took up
land in manitoba he too lost four crops of
wheat by frost while the fifth blessed him with
an increase of fifty fold

  he utterly refused to take land farther
south because he wouldnt set foot off british
soil merely to gain a worldly profit but when
he was subsequently called to preach in the
united states he went his notion being that
a call to preach was from the lord and mightnt
be disobeyed

  obstinacy some would call it but anyway it
is a testimony to the stout fiber of the british
character and it explains in some measure why
england is still a sturdy nation though her
authentic history goes back more than a thou-
sand years

not being an erudite student of folk-
lore i find myself reading mr ca-
bells explanation of the origin and meaning
of his story in the same spirit as i read his
romance the image of sesphra some
day ill look for codman and go in search of
a copy of lewistams key to the popular
tales of poictesme and solve the riddle
maybe some of you have your own opin-
ions about the meaning of the tale

dumbarton va

  erudite students of folk-lore will of course
not fail to recognize in the image of
sesphra a rehandling of one of the legends clus-
tering about that half-mythical dom manuel
whom codman calls the achilles of poictesme
as jurgen is its ulysses these tales however
remain very little known to the average reader
and indeed i propose some day to publish an
abridgement of the manuel epos in the belief
that with slight modernizations his exploits may
yet lie esteemed not uncurious by persons desiring
to kill off a vacant half-hour

  this particular episode is in lewistams opin-
ion -an allegory of the creative literary instinct
of the will to write things now my personal
feeling rather obstinately balks at that unriddling
irrespective of its plausibility for it is certainly
plausible and the fact is past question note-
worthy that alike in the old french and in our
english sesphra is an anagram on phrases
yet as lewistam concedes there is obscurity in
the parable a troubling shifting of the symbol-
ism so that although the image created by
manuel may well be interpreted as a book in-
spired by his love for freydis and surviving its
begetters yet still to quote from the key to
the popular tales of poictesme the returning
sesphra is surely no book but rather the literary
instinct itself resistless and beauty-loving and
defiant of all human ties

  these things are as they may be for one i
prefer to view this story as unadulterate romance
with no more though to be sure no less of
ulterior teachings concealed about its evolution
than is detectable in the unfolding of the chron-
icle-history of cinderella or of puss in boots
and sargyll i elect to believe is an island that
stands salubriously removed from the gray coasts
of pedagogia i humbly confess even so my
quite personal opinion in this matter to be of
no more weight than is the opinion of any other
reader of romance

meet a new writer miss nell han-
son author of jimsie of kilmack

montreal canada

  jimsie of kilmack is my fourth attempt
at fiction and my very first accepted manu-
script  so critics please be gentle as you
read as i am so very new and totally un-
famous im afraid nothing i write about its
origin can be of great interest however as it
is the custom of the magazine that contributors
should write a few lines for the meeting-place
the meeting-place

  iqo

i can only do as i am asked whether i have
anything interesting to say or not seeing that
the editor has been so nice and kind as to buy
my story

  by the way i notice among numberless writers
a tendency to consider all editors who buy their
particular creations nice and kind and altogether
delightful and those who send them rejection-
slips impossible men i have tried during my
extremely short literary career not to harbor
resentment but i must confess to a distinct bias
toward romance

   i wrote the story early in the year while ill
in bed i had been reading marion crawfords
in the palace of the king and the tragedy of
the hunchback jester struck me and remained
with me afterward far more than anything else
in the book and gradually in a day or two
wove itself into the story of jimsie and norah-
i dont quite know how i suppose i made it
happen in ireland because i am irish though
ive lived in canada for a number of years and
because i love ireland and love the west clare
coast that i have tried to use as a background
there my grandparents lived and there my
mother spent much of her girlhood and i have
vivid memories of happy summers spent there
when i was a child of the gentle lovable won-
derfully courteous country-people of the sea and
the sunsets and the curraghs in the bay of the
larks singing overhead i remember especially
one year when we returned to london that
station after station as we passed through was
filled with men and women the women with their
shawls over their heads keening bitterly as the
train bore away their loved ones emigrants to
the far america i didnt know i was going
to be an emigrant myself one day

  and because no one can know that one is irish
jor two minutes without asking ones politics i
may say that i was a believer in john red-
mond but now i dont quite know what i am
most emphatically my views are not those of the

  possibly one of the greatest writers of prose
and verse that has been produced on the
american continent in the past century was
ruben dario who died in  this man was
an indian of pure blood born in nicaragua like
many another great man he was misunderstood
by some of the petty government officials of his
country who wished to mold the people to their
puny outlook on life and was compelled to leave
soon after attaining early manhood

  he became a wanderer through the lands of
south america and first came into international
prominence by the publication of a book of prose
which he called azul after victor hugos
motto lart eest iazurl juan valera the
famous spanish critic was very severe in his

criticism claiming that dario should have given
more time to the teaching of correct spanish
he was especially hostile to the title wanting to
know why was art blue rather than yellow red
green or plain white or black it was in the
book but don juan stern realist was unable
to see it dario proved that he had his hand
on the pulse of youth by revolutionizing spanish
literature heading what is known as the
modernista movement which spread to all span-
ish-speaking lands of the earth

  he resided at some time or other in all the
latin-american countries and later spent some
time in europe he is as well known to readers
of spanish as shakespeare is to readers of english
i remember seeing him in buenos aires several
years ago a great broad-shouldered man with a
placid face and large brown eyes beneath an
expanse of forehead such a peculiar striking ap-
pearance of face and figure as to cause me to
remember it today he was possibly a straight
descendant from the royal races that inhabited
central america before the conquest races that
were enjoying the highest type of civilization
when men of europe were living in caves and
fighting with stone axes

  in all of his works he teaches the compelling
force of the desire for the ideal this ideal he
compares to the veto de la reina mab the veil
of queen mab a veil of opalescent blue made of
filmy gauze he illustrates this by showing
queen mab coming to four gaunt unshaven men
in a garret-a sculptor a painter a poet and a
musician they are lamenting the sordidness and
brutality of life she alights from her car made
of a single pearl and twines them in the folds of
her veil their sighs and groans are turned to
laughter as they glimpse the world as it now
appears to them

  in other words life is as you look upon it
adolescent youth sees it full of promise old
age views it with a tinge of bitterness it gives
back the image that is thrown from the mind

  romance does it exist ill say it does
it has made easy many a rough spot for me
some one will come along and say there is no
romance in the world and then there will a
regular mob rise up and tell him there is to
me it represents the veil of queen mab i am
also a very stern realist like don juan valera
but i now and then try to clutch a comer of
the veil and peer at things as they should be-
the ideal state to which we will evolve as human
beings within the next several thousand years

japan-the old japan-will never
cease to be a source of romance the
tale of the talking skull in the septem-
ber issue is one of a number of similar
folk-stories that will appear in romance
mr post wheeler tells us something of how
his material was gathered

stockholm

  i spent seven years in tokyo at our embassy
-nearly two years of that time as charge
daffaires-and during that time was able to make


the meeting-place

a study of japanese things and thoughts which
only a long period can make possible as you
will understand there are many tilings in an
oriental country which one does not begin in
any way to grasp until one has gained some
acquaintance with the language and some famil-
iarity with the literature verbal and written
folk-lore has always been a hobby of mine per-
haps you have seen my russian wonder tales
which i did when  was american charge
daffaires in petrograd-or rather st ietersbffi-g
and i gave to japanese folk-lore the leisure time
of those seven years in compiling a collection
which i have aimed to make comprehensive

  i have put together a vast number literally
thousands of tales taken down in many cases
in shorthand from the lips of professional story-
tellers for japan has these just as turkey and
persia and have compared variants and traced
sources it is my intention to bring these out
in perhaps fifteen volumes in the near future and
he tales which romance is to publish are offered
with a view to familiarize the western public
with this mass of popular fiction which i con-
sider so interesting and valuable for western
scholarship to understand this task has of
course cost me very great labor and inciden-
tally of course thousands of dollar but il has
also been a labor of love

post wheeler

 thought konrad bercovici knew
more about gipsies than he knew about
the people of the city before i read his
recent book dust of new york and
broken dreams the story that appears
in this issue of romance

morristown n j

  the characters in broken dreams are old ac-
quaintances of mine to a good many people
in new york the story will be merely a printed
record of facts i am afraid -however that i
shall not be on speaking-terms any more with
a few men and women with whom i have
chatted frequently seated at the same table in
some east side cafes but that is very often the
fate of the writer who writes what he observes
instead of what he invents

  the truth about my work in general is that
 am so interested in following and observing
the threads of the lives of people i know that
i have little time to write down what i see
some of my stories though actually written in
a few hours have taken years of another kind
of work the actual process of writing is to
me what the stuffing of the kill is to a pas-
sionate hunter the hunting the following of
a maze of faint tracks in the beaten trails of
the woods the tracing of the animal to its lair
after losing the scent again and again is what
gives me great pleasure

  frequently one follows the track of a bear
only to cross the footprints of a deer or hear
the powerful wing-strokes of an eagle overhead
or suddenly face a wolf and there are also
beautiful birds and interesting insects-some that
sting but give honey and others that merely
sting for the hunter the forests are stocked

iqi

with game-and the world is my hunting-ground
the sky in a singing blue or a deadly ashen
the forest decked in green or black and nakedj
the mountains the seas arc all for me to see
to tread to swim men women children-in
white brown red yellow black gay or sad
happy or otherwise-i am alive to them

  if i am able to describe but a little of what
i hear and see every day it makes me happy
for twenty years  have struggled against
authoring now its all over i have fallen
i pray god that my readers be merciful vae
victisl woe to the vanquished

  of the east side i know this much after
many years of study it does not matter much
in what language people are happy or sad a
thousand superficialities differences in culture
tradition and religious rituals make one believe
that all nations are not alike but after closer
observation the rock-bottom essentials which are
common to all mankind convince one that love
is love and hate is hate in the hearts of men
and women of all colors of all races

 but those differences how subtle and
eluding

konrad bercovici

heres a proof that subway-riding
isnt all crush and curses

new york city

  the idea of stella maris of petes came
to me on the sea beach subway leaving
coney island before you go underground you
pass through a dispirited slovenly section of
patchy shacks and boat-houses one particularly
dirgy brown house has a large sign stella on
top the name is so ironical the place so un-
star-like that immediately i began to imagine it
to be the road-house of my story out beyond
the creek lies the bay and the clean free ocean
but here is only unloveliness

  then it occurred to me to call the girl and not
the house stella and to make the one person
on earth who fully understands her-the scholar
-nickname her stella maris a harmless
whimsicality since no one else has the slightest
inkling of what it means the plot was simply
to develop the tiny gleam of goodness that lay
within her thus justifying the appellation for
the time being

  but dont place any halo on stella she wont
have another god-like experience she rose to
the heights-once thats all thats the story
the rest of her life will probably fray out like
the old house on the creek no one will mourn
its demolition except the scholar-if he survives
her but wont you always feel a little more
charitable for knowing her romance

meila russell mccallum

france knows how to recognize
romance when she finds it i see that
the french academys grand prix de

recently appeared in english in adventure
this being its first publication in this
country

romance
the meeting-place

 iq

here is a word about authors haloes
from a poet whose work has been
published in romance

new york city

  the editor tells me that there is a meeting-
place in this magazine where that distant odd
and haloed creature the author may take off his
halo for a while and be a real human with the
other real humans his readers it sounds good-
providedone has a halo

  when i got the news i looked for my halo at
once but i couldnt find it i have been writing
for a long time and my latest book is just out so
i suppose i am an author but where my halo is
i dont know all i ever have to wear on my
head is an occasional hat decorously trimmed by
myself and i usually feel as humble about my
hats as i do about my books

  of course when i was very young in the days
before i had to think about buying hats i used
to dream about a halo  thought i wanted one
i still think it might be becoming but i dont
think of hats or haloes nowadays when i write
i just try to tell my readers what i honestly think
and feel about life and i believe in my readers
i believe they will care most for the best things
i have to say to them i believe that if there are
any haloes the readers wear them

  i have had some readers i know whose haloes
must be big and beautiful if kindness of heart
can make them so one of them whom i have
never met sent me a dozen ears of sweet green
corn from the country not long ago it came in
the morning mail along with a very cruel review
of my book who minds a review when there are
roasting-ears  another reader sent me a little
bunch of violets and early buttercups last spring
another once sent me a dozen fresh eggs and
sometimes they write letters that are as good as
corn or eggs or spring blossoms readers truly
wear haloes and the beauty of it is that in
spite of that fact they are not always odd and
distant seems to me they should be invited to
the meeting-place too and that they should
bring their haloes with them

marguerite wilkinson

from bernard raymund whose poem
the freshet appears in this issue

columbus ohio

  i wonder that i feel at home in this de-
partment since i do not remember having been
in any out-of-the-way place in my twenty-six
years the most exciting thing i do is to teach
medical students physiology in the winter and
swing a scythe or spray potatoes in the summer
people often ask how do you ever find time to
write well i just dont not half-enough

bernard raymund

there is one feature of romance-
the most important a cynical news-
dealer might say-that we have tried to
keep in tune with the rest of the magazine
and that is the cover this letter from a

reader makes me feel we havent altogether
missed our object or to put the praise
where it belongs its proof that leon bel-
lisle the artist knows how to catch the
spirit of romance in line and color

burlington vt

  the july number of the romance magazine
has on the- cover a picture of a native girl
of one of the pacific islands she is standing
on the sand and behind her are some green palm-
trees sharp against an intensely blue unclouded
sky and-the bluer ocean for us in the united
states in new england that picture is indeed
romance the new and different beauty the what-
may-happen-next feeling the far-off place which
is not too far-off for the possibility of our some
day going there there must be the possibility
of realization in romance not only something
lost behind the ranges something hidden but
also the go and find it mood

  the essence of romance is in the combination of
the strange and the possible the unknown and
the familiar but it is easy to let the familiar
things become boringly usual and when they do
we seek romance in literature to relieve the
heaviness of the prosaic and to renew our powers
of seeing grasping the wonder all about us

         and all unseen
     romance brought up the nine-fifteen

  the picture on the july cover is suggestive of
adventure strange reality new beauty that is
to us in this country but to the girl to any
one living on that far hot shore i wonder what
the outlook is many eventless days-changeless
weather from the empty sunlit routine of that
life i think one might look far off and see a
different romance here wherever this here may
be mine as i write is a new england town of
many gardens great elms and cool still houses
the catching of romance depends more upon
attitude of mind than circumstances the stories
we read of other peoples adventure ought to
show us how to see the romance near by in any
life and to stir up the desire for more and more
of it

  i	should like to know if your readers think
they have any romance actually in their own
lives or if they have only the desire for it in
the thing just beyond would it not be possible
and interesting too to open discussion in the
meeting-place pages about the reality of romance
and what it actually is for people need it so
often and dont know how to see it

helen underwood hoyt

  yes the meeting-place has always been
open for a discussion of this kind but
please forgive me but i must say it
most of you readers are so very shy about
giving your ideas of romance heres
hoping this appeal from a fellow reader
will send more of you hurrying to the ink-
well

the ugly duckling

by laura kent

   mr peek the manager of our office stormed up the aisle
between two rows of desks

   wheres that miller girl shes never to be depended on

   i looked at the other girls and they looked at me miss
miller was the most conscientious one of our number and
we knew it right well but that fact did not ease her
suffering in any way when mr peck shouted at her later
for a thousand and one imagined shortcomings

   i didnt like miss miller but i felt sorry for her

   i admired her too she was so brave she faced scolding
after scolding from mr peek and many a slight from more
than one of the girls without flinching-until one day

   i found her one afternoon just after unch
in the room just outside of the office crying
as if her heart had broken i forgot my
dislike for her in a moment tears make any-
body your sister

  you are sick i asked though j knew
perfectly well that she wasnt

   yes she sobbed if its being sick to be
sick of life

   i laid my hand on miss millers shoulder

she looked up at me with unbelieving eyes for
none of its had ever touche  her before  won  t
you tell me your trouble dear  asked

  she could only say incredulously you
dont mean that nobody means to be good
to an ugly duckling 

  a blush burned my face for i knew then
that miss miller had overheard what miss
terry had said to me about her a few
minutes earlier

 oh you shouldnt be too severe on miss
terry-shes such a fearfully thoughtless
creature nine tenths of the things she
says are said without thinking

   miss miller dried her eyes and talked with
sudden firmness this thing that shes
said now is the one-tenth that shes thought
about i am an ugly duckling 

   then without further ado she took her hat
and went away mr peck told us later that
she had found a better position so she told
him but i knew better her self-respect would
not permit her to remain among us longer

   i suffered the most intense shock of my life
about four months later i met the ugly
duckling at an engagement reception 
looked and looked the realization of the fact that i was
race to face with the miss miller i had once worked with
was painfully difficult when the last vestige of doubt
disappeared i could only stand spellbound and give utter-
ance to a long astonished -o-o-o-oh

  ft the ugly duckling was no loneer an ugly duck-
ling anybody even miss terry who used never to tire
of ridiculing her at the office would have called miss miller
a beauty now

   how did you do it i gasped

  she answered with a simple sincerity i am not going
to pretend that i dont know what youre talking about
she said you want to know what became of the tiglv
duckling 

   i laughed off my embarrassment

  fashion academy she said

  fashion academy i asked i saw no connection

  yes rashion academy helped me out just after i had
made up my mind to stop being an uglv duckling i had
heard about rashion academy from a friend i turned to
i in my hour of humiliation because i had the vague feeling
that somehow a good part of the ugliness of all ugly duck-
lings is in the feathers fine feathers make fine birds
they say to make a lonp story short i enrolled for
fashion academy courses in costume and millinerv
design

  not much more than a month later i was designing
dresse-- and hats for myself that made me-i must say it-
beautiful i learned that i had been dressing the wrong
way all my life i learned how much clothes may mean to
a woman in short  learned ho lo dress

  i learned that every womans figure is an individual
thing that every womans personality is something apart
from all other personalities i learned how to adapt the
lines of a gown and a hat to my figure i learned to seit

colors to my complexion ami the coloring of my eyes and
hair i learned how to express my personality in dress
in other words i learned how to dress my individual self of
all women in the world

   and every style of dress or hat was original for i de-
signed it myself i do not now have to e humiliated by
seeing my style of dress or hat on every fourth woman that
i meet that is what often happens when you buy a dress
or hat of popular style in the shops what is more  have
made every dress myself from the drafting of the pattern
to the very last stitch-every hat from the making of the
frame to the last bit of trimming and the cost of these home-
made dresses and hats as beautifully mdv
as anything one could buy in the store v a-
irom one-third to one-tenth the store price

   miss miller paused i began to think that
j too had been more of an ugly duckling
than i need have been what i thought
would charming original dresses and hats
designed just for me do for my appearance
and then  said to miss miller but i sup-
pose the learning was terribly hard

   she smiled thats quite the most re-
markable thing about it she replied
learning a fashion academy home-study
course is more like play than like work the
lessons are marvelously simple and so fas-
cinatingly interesting that every one in my
family was as anxious to see them as i was
i spent never more than two hours a week on
my designing and yet the results i got were
splendid according to my teachers its so
pleasant to be able to improve oneself right
in the comfort of ones own home besides
of course a home-study course costs only
about one-fourth the price of the course
taken right at the school

i	

   so ended the ugly ducklings story of how
she stopped being an ugly duckling now
i too have enrolled for a home-study course
with fashion academy i have only done
three lessons so far but already i have made
great progress the interest my teachers
take in me is simply splendid each lesson is
criticized in the greatest detail and when-
ever any little part of the work is not done
topleise them i am asked to do it over again

   i am beginning to think of the possibility of becoming a
professional costume designer from letters that are
published in the beautifully illustrated booklet sent by
fashion academy sent free upon request i can see wonder-
ful opportunities in this work one former student of
fashion academy earned si a week and designed cos-
tumes for lady duff gordon ilucile three months after her
graduation and hers is only one instance of the great
number of amazing successes made by fashion academy
graduates as professional designers
