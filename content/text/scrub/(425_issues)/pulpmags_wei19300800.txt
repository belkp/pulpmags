a gratifying letter from henry s whitehead author of the jumbee
stories hiay prove of interest to our readers it pleases me writes
doctor whitehead from both writers and readers viewpoints to see
how you have brought the magazine up its conception as a medium for the
occult filled a vast need both for writers and readers so important does this
existence of a medium for the publication of occult and similarly weird stories
appear to me that in  i did an article entitled the occult story for the
free-lance writers annual in that article which is today regarded as the
standard statement on the subject and along with john farrar a hamilton
gibbs john gallishaw mary roberts rinehart burges johnson augustus
thomas henry seidel canby john bakeless robert e sherwood ivy l lee
ben ames williams coningsby dawson and other contributors for it was the
editors desire to cover the whole field of fiction writing i took occasion to
mention weird tales as the sole medium for the occult story in the united
states

  to one particularized point all this comment of mine intended to be read
by professional writers was directed viz that editors in general editors of
magazines that is would not touch the occult story with a ten-foot pole this
need of both authors desiring to write in this medium and readers wishful of
reading their output has been met by weird tales and i am tempted to add
in the current argot of the flappers-and how

  it is on this how that i offer congratulations when you took over the
magazine its front office was overloaded as i happen to know with material
purchased by the former proprietors not all of it up to the standard you have
set by careful discrimination wise and gradual improvement and a steady pull
toward perfection professional writers as witness elliott odonnells forth-
coming tale and e f bensons james lamp in the current issue are coming
back in weird tales this from my viewpoint is one of the most encour-
aging signs for the future of weird tales the magazine is far beyond and

heaps of our beloved reading-crazy land it is a real accomplishment on your
part

  your writers in the eyrie comment twice on my own work in the magazine
in the june issue i beg to thank both approving readers herewith but it is
of greater interest perhaps to comment on that work by saying that i feel my
stories have in the past been handicapped by their very authenticity the
whitehead jumbee stories are written with as muchcare for that same authen-
ticity as though they were being composed for a posterity of classical commenta-
tors as numerous and one-minded as edgar allan poes they run through the
veritable gamut of the beliefs and practises of the caribbean peoples and there
has never been a single point about them which is not authentic i e the beliefs
brought into and woven through their plots are real beliefs the settings are set-
tings of actuality the history involved is real history the speech of the various
types of natives is taken from their own lips and what mr dwyer is kind enough
to call my color and real atmosphere is the color and breath of the west indies
as they are like a beethoven sonata granted one has the technical skill to play
it properly it is not necessary to do more than to reproduce what the composer
has set down

  martin j eberhardt of brooklyn writes to the eyrie as a consistent reader
of weird tales i should like to join in the monthly debate conducted in the
eyrie specifically i should like to offer a brief criticism of the criticism of the
magazine by bernard austin dwyer of kingston new york which appeared
in the june issue in the main i think mr dwyer is justified in all he says but
i want to rise in defense of the thousands of readers who consider seabury quinn
the premier writer of the corps of entertainers who help make weird tales
the truly unique magazine beyond doubt both lovecraft and whitehead can
outwrite doctor quinn occasionally both have published occasional stories as
good as quinns best probably better than anything by him with the possible
exception of the phantom farmhouse but what mr dwyer overlooks is the
consistent high class of quinns product he doesnt turn out an occasional
masterpiece but he does write excellent exciting highly entertaining storiesi
and writes them month after month with no appreciable falling off in quality
this i think is what we quinn fans mean when we say we consider our favorite
your best writer we may be thrilled or horrified once in a while by the truly
wonderful stories of the other writers every issue were sure of entertainment
and thrills by seabury quinn hes good solid stuff from start to finish his
opening situations are always novel the adventures of jules de grandin are
widely different in each tale and about the only thing the reader can safely pre-
dict when he begins one of quinns stories is that the little french ghost-breaker
will develop a mighty thirst by the time the adventure is done just one thing
more mr dwyer complains that jules de grandin is speaking better english
now than he did when we first met him well why not hes been living with

friend trowbridge for upward of five years now speaking english almost ex-
clusively he wouldnt be the brilliant little fellow we know him to be if his
english hadnt improved in that time when he remembers to make mistakes
as mr dwyer has it its only in the stress of extraordinary excitement at all other
times he shows that hes done what every foreigner does if he remains here long
enough learned to think in english

  i have been a reader of your magazine for over a year writes d t logan
of redding california and let me tell you its wonderful absolutely wonder-
ful the stories are just the type to make one forget everyday cares they are so
different from the average run of stories be sure that you never let that good
author seabury quinn get away from you hes a marvel so far i have only
found one thing wrong with weird tales and that is the fact that it doesnt
come around soon enough a month is certainly a long time to wait for so much
pleasure but at that it gives one something mighty pleasant to look forward to
would it be asking too much to request you to publish matthew arnolds poem
the forsaken merman i think that poem is sufficiently weird to merit a cou-
ple of pages in weird tales it is against our editorial policy to print poems
more than one page long the forsaken merman can be found in any public
library and we recommend its perusal to those who wish to read a fine weird

ade is an evil thing i tell you
sir that green stone holds all the
wickedness of centuries did you
know that nobody can say for sure where
it comes from no that is part of the
wickedness stone it is a gem stone
here and there it turns up all over the
world in lost cities in old graves they
find it but always it has been in the
hands of some artist out of those dim past
centuries-carved smoothed polished
some say all the jade in the world came

    

from the furnaces of those evilly wise
priests of the lost atlantis ages since it

may be so ive seen jade that-

  listen i jumped ship that night at-
well never mind it was one of those mis
begotten ports on the coast of yucatart
just a scattered group of huts above a
strip of white sand with the green wall
of the jungle coming down like a wave
behind it i swam ashore and lay hid
there in a native hut until the ship had
gone the indian hid me why not
that small silver coin was wealth to him
or it would have been if-yes sir
money buys a lot in those out of the way
places

  when  woke up the mozo was talk-
ing to himself i looked over from my
comer and saw him sitting in the door-
way there were things scattered around
him on the sand and he was picking

them up one by one and talking to him-
self very well pleased he was and why
not queer things for a mozo to have-
white mens things-a canteen a hat a
belt with a gun on it

  the old fellow looked them over
laid them down he picked up a drill coat
and emptied out the pockets a lot of stuff
-notebooks maps one thing and an-

                                          

the indian was all for taking tbese
things away from him


weird tales

  lother and then he picked up something
 i that made me sit up a bit of green all
 cool-looking and transparent like the sea
 out by the reef here i says lets see
 that

   he didnt know i was awake and it
 scared him first off he was all for
 putting everything away but i talked him
 out of it persuaded him gave him an-
 other silver piece

    you know what that green thing was
 jade a little piece of green stone no
 bigger than my thumb as cool to the
 touch as it looked and smooth i tell you
 sir there is nothing smoother than pol-
 i ished jade carved it was i couldnt
 make it out at first then i saw it was
 an elephant fighting trunk up and ears
 wide and twined around him choking
 him was a snake think of it-a snake
 big enough to choke an elephant

   the mozo put out his hand he
 vanted that jade elephant back wait a
 bit i says whered this come from

    that indian shook his head scared
 he didnt want to talk but when i hung
 onto the elephant he motioned over his
 shoulder at the jungle and muttered
 something it sounded like ximu-tal

     ximu-tal i says whats that
 and finally i got out of him that ximu-
 tal was one of the old gods or maybe
 just a high priest a big medicine man
 ages before this indians people had come
 to the coast where i said but he
 wouldnt tell me

    i handed the jade piece back to him
 hating to let go of it its like that with
 jade you want to hang onto it smoothing
 of it    and then i lay down and pre-
 tended to go to sleep again i wasnt
 asleep though i was watching that mozo
 to see where hed hide the stuff and i
 -as thinking funny that an indian

would have a white mans outfit like that
i kept wondering where he got it and
how

  i saw where he hid it in the thatch
of the wall the old fellow lay down
right in front of it but after awhile when
i was sure he was asleep i got out of the
hut and went around outside where i
could burrow in and get it i felt better
when i got that belt around me and the
gun against my leg bad customers some-
times those coast indians treacherous
yes sir

   i was sitting there back inside look-
ing over the maps and things when the
mozo woke up they didnt mean much
to me those maps not knowing the lay
of the country one of the notebooks had
pictures sketched in and one of them
was of a stone building sort of a temple
on a little hill what made me notice it
was the way it had a big snake around it
carved in the stone

  the indian was all for taking those
things away from me kept after me
ugly i didnt have any more silver
finally i had to persuade him with the
gun hitting him over the head with the
butt i didnt want to shoot him the
whole village would have been in on top
of me i tied him up and leaned him
against a wall he wouldnt talk just sat
there looking at me with his eyes glinting
at me hard like brown glass i was glad
he was tied up i tell you sir they are
treacherous devils those indians

  but he had to talk i made him i
had to know that jade elephant was in
my pocket under my thumb i had to
know where it came from and the mozo
knew i could see that there was a
little fire in the hut i shoved some coals
over against his feet and let him think
about it-hot coals
the curse of ximu-tal



  i slipped out of the village that
night the indian had a little boucan
hung up there was a little fruit i took
that slung in a net over my shoulder i
left the mozo tied up and gagged he
couldnt have followed me though not
far no   

c tust inside the green wall of jungle i
 found the road hed told about a
stone road running away from the coast
straight as a string sometime that had
been a great road i tell you sir stone
blocks laid wide enough for two or three
to walk abreast they had great engi-
neers the old boys who built those lost
cities why i saw later on-but never
mind that

  three days i followed that road and
didnt make three times that many miles
the jungle had taken it smothered it
trees grew against the stones across
them between them vines wove green
nets until you couldnt see beyond arms
reach and the stone blocks big as a
wagon-bed were torn up and tossed
aside by the roots that reached in between
and under and all the time i had a
queer feeling that the jungle was alive
growing up behind me as fast as i was
cutting it away in front i knew i was
watched too no it wasnt the indians
i wasnt worrying about the indians the
way that mozo had talked i knew they
wouldnt come that road snakes hed
said but i didnt see any not many
anyway

  the fourth morning i came into
more of an open the jungle wasnt quite
so thick i tell you i was glad my hand
was one blister and my arm an ache from
using the machete so much to cut my way
through my food was gone too and my
water and so when the trees opened up

a little and i could see around i was glad

  it was a queer place that road had
brought me to a stone city that covered
acres and acres and not a soul living in it
can you believe it no sir not a living
soul great walls hundreds of feet long
all carved with queer heads and curly-
cues on the biggest building there were
heads that looked like elephants think
of that elephants in a jungle where no
one had ever seen an elephant but on
all the other buildings-over the big
arches of the doorways along the tops of
the walls twined about carved heads of
queer-looking men-were snakes cut
from- the stone it got so after awhile it
seemed like they were alive oh it was
a bad place and everywhere-in the
streets in the houses on the walls-were
trees growing hundreds of years old

  i was looking for that little hill with
the snake temple on top of it that id
found in the notebook and by and by i
found it the hill was a pyramid did
you know those old engineers built pyra-
mids like the egyptians did yes some
say both came from the same stock from
that same sunken island where they made
the jade   

  there were wide stone steps running
up on all four sides of the pyramid to
the temple on top and i climbed up i
could see someone had been here not
very long ago and i knew for sure this
was the place from what that indian had
told me and what i could make out from
the notebook and maps i knew pretty
well what to look for and i found it-
a big stone block in the floor of the tem-
ple propped up with a rock with a dark
hole under it

  i didnt like the looks of that hole
no sir i went outside and looked at the
stone snake that ran like a balustrade all


weird tales

around the temple and i liked it less
than ever then my fingers touched that
jade elephant in my pocket and the
smooth feel of it made me go on i made
up some bundles of dry wood rolled
tight for torches and started down the
hole

  the white man whoever he was had
worked hard i wondered how he knew
where to dig the old passage had been
full of dirt and little rocks and he had
carried it all out burrowing he must
have been a worker that fellow i lit one
of my torches and crawled down

  there was one bad place a big rock
in the top of the passage had started to
fall in and the white man had propped it
up with a thick stick just room to edge
by with dirt and little rocks dropping if
you just touched that stick i didnt like
it no sir

  stooped over bent double i went
down that passage first thing i knew
there i was in a room i was below the
level of the city by then way down
beneath the hill in the virgin rock part
of the wall looked like rock that water
has worn and part of it had been cut
away and smoothed off

   first off i thought this was as far as i
could go there was just this room a
score of feet maybe across not a sign
anywhere of an opening except that low
doorway where id come in silent it
was still youve thought you knew what
silence was maybe-out in the woods or
at night there never was anything as
still and silent as that low room down
under ximu-tals temple it was a stillness
that you could feel if you know what i
mean soft and gentle at first but push-
ing and pushing until youd feel you
couldnt stand it any longer just wear
you out it would with its soft pushing

   i couldnt find any way beyond and
yet i knew there must be that indian

had said- it was then i noticed it

that carved snake of ximu-tals it was
like that great carved snake around the
temple above only not quite the same
this looked a lot older the old fellow
that cut it there in the living rock of that
cave didnt know his job as well as the
one that came later but you knew what
he meant it for oh i knew what it was
that head 

t saw the tail of it first that sculptor

  jl fellow had carved it so that it hung
down the wall and out upon the floor i
lighted up another of my torches and
followed the body of the snake winding
along the wall over and above the door
where id come in right around that
room until it came back to the side where
the tail was and there was the head
god what a head the old artist had
taken a knob of stone on the wall and cut
it into the head of a snake with jaws wide
open just like the serpent was coming
for you ready to strike

  theyd painted that snake green it
was head to tail all the length of it and
between the open jaws back in the throat
it was red like a flame but it was the
eyes-i tell you sir those eyes were
alive bright and hard and glistening
pieces of jade as big as my hand round
and polished

  beneath the snakes head on one of
the stone blocks of the floor was carved
something some of that picture stuff it
was one of those old hieroglyphs that not
one of these blessed science sharps has
been able to read-not one of them

  i couldnt read it but i knew what it
meant just as plain as could be it told
me to turn around and go and never
the curse of ximu-tal



come back i looked from the picture
writing to the head of that emerald snake
and my heart was like water i knew if
i didnt do what that old priest chap
ximu-tal was telling me that his snake
would get me yes sir i knew it

   i was going i tell you i was going
when my thumb hit upon the little jade
elephant in my pocket cool and smooth
and then i couldnt go i had to see it
through it was like the snake was warn-
ing me to pull out and the elephant was
telling me to stay and i stayed

 i knelt there by that picture writing
just under the head of ximu-tals snake
and felt the carving over with my fingers
i could see someone had been there before
me doing that same thing disturbing the
dust that had lain there nobody knows
how long

   i knew i was on the right track i
felt the carving over there was a snake
running through and i had a thought i
pressed on the head of the snake i pulled
on it something i did and one end of
that stone block swung up

   a queer wicked smell came from that
black hole a strange smell i didnt know
what but i took the last of my torches
and went down all the way down
those stone steps all the way along the
passage that slanted off into the rock i
knew-mind you i knew-that at the
end i was going to hit upon something
wickeder and more evil than anything i
had ever seen but i went

   pretty soon away off there in front of
me i saw a light a little flickering light
like a green flame i came to a doorway
and put my torch through and saw what
it was ill tell you but you wont believe
me nobody would

   it was a round room deep down there
in the living rock beneath that dead city

a big round room with a vaulted ceiling
it was like i was on the inside of half a
hollow ball out there in the middle just
in front of me was a stone coffin with
more of that picture stuff on it ximu-
tals coffin it was huge and heavy and
on top of the stone lid was a green snake
that was what i had seen like green
flame ahead of me the upraised head of
that snake of ximu-tals

   blew my torch into burning-my
last torch it was too-and went over to
the coffin there was something under
my feet brittle things that snapped
under me like dried sticks but i couldnt
stop to look god what a thing that was
that jade snake on ximu-tals coffin big
my two arms wouldnt go around that
piece i tell you and cold and translucent
as green ice

   but that wasnt it not the size of it
it was what it was there was the snake
and the elephant again but they werent
fighting no they werent fighting any
more the elephant was down dead-
crushed in the folds of that great snake
think what a snake must be to crush an
elephant that way

  oh it was a wicked thing that snake
head up jaws wide and yet the beauty
of it the evil loveliness of that snake as
it reared above the stone coffin my hands
ached for it i wanted to feel the cool
smoothness of it flowing over my fingers
up my arms and i was afraid i knew
that if i touched the snake of ximu-tal
as the other man had-i could see where
his fingers had smoothed the dust from
it-i was done i wanted it and i was
afraid my fingers went out to it-slow
-rslow

the twigs which nlonga flung on
the fire broke and crackled the
upleaping flames lighted the coun-
tenances of die two men nlonga voo-
doo man of the slave coast was very old
his wizened and gnarled frame was
stooped and brittle his face creased by
hundreds of wrinkles the red firelight
glinted on the human finger-bones which
composed his necklace

    

  the other was a white man and his
name was solomon kane he was tall and
broad-shouldered clad in blade close gar-
ments the garb of the puritan his feather-
less slouch hat was drawn low over his
heavy brows shadowing his darkly pallid
face his cold deep eyes brooded in the
firelight

  you come again brother droned the
fetish-man speaking in the jargon which
passed for a common language of black
man and white on the west coast many

palaver you go to the setting sun but
you come back

  aye kanes voice was deep and al-

weird

tales

something entered into my blood some-
thing stole into my soul like a whisper of
unnamed sin the jungle dark and
brooding-over leagues of the blue salt
sea she has drawn me and with the dawn
i go to seek the heart of her mayhap i
shall find curious adventure-mayhap my
doom awaits me but better death than the
ceaseless and everlasting urge the fire that
has burned my veins with bitter longing

  she call muttered nlonga at
night she coil like serpent about my hut
and whisper strange things to me at ya
the jungle call we be blood-brothers
you and i me nlonga mighty worker
of nameless magic you go to the jungle
as all men go who hear her call maybe
you live more like you die you believe
in my fetish work

   i understand it not said kane grim-
ly but i have seen you send your soul
forth from your body to animatea lifeless
corpse

  aye me nlonga priest of the black
god now watch i make magic

  kane gazed at the black man who bent
over the fire making even motions with
his hands and mumbling incantations
kane watched and he seemed to grow
sleepy a mist wavered in front of him
through which he saw dimly the form of
nlonga etched black against the flames
then all faded out

  kane awoke with a start hand shoot-
ing to the pistol in his belt nlonga
grinned at him across the flame and there
was a scent of early dawn in the air the
fetish-man held a long stave of curious
black wood in his hands this stave was
carved in a strange manner and one end
tapered to a sharp point

  this voodoo staff said nlonga
putting it in the englishmans hand
where your guns and long knife fail

this save you when you want me lay
this on your breast fold your hands on it
and sleep i come to you in your dreams
kane weighed the thing in his hand
highly suspicious of witchcraft it was not
heavy but seemed hard as iron a good
weapon at least he decided dawn was
just beginning to steal over the jungle and
the river

	red eyes

solomon kane shifted his musket
from his shoulder and let the stock fall
to the earth silence lay about him like a
fog kanes lined face and tattered gar-
ments showed the effect of long bush
travel he looked about him

  some distance behind him loomed the
green rank jungle thinning out to low
shrubs stunted trees and tall grass some
distance in front of him rose the first of a
chain of bare somber hills littered with
boulders shimmering in the merciless
heat of the sun between the hills and the
jungle lay a broad expanse of rough un-
even grasslands dotted here and there by
clumps of thorn-trees

  an utter silence hung over the country
the only sign of life was a few vultures
flapping heavily across the distant hills
for the last few days kane had noticed
the increasing number of these unsavory
birds the sun was rocking westward
but its heat was in no way abated

  trailing his musket he started forward
slowly he had no objective in view this
was all unknown country and one direc-
tion was as good as another many weeks
ago he had plunged into the jungle with
the assurance born of courage and igno-
rance having by some miracle survived
the first few weeks he was becoming hard
and toughened able to hold his own with
any of the grim denizens of the fastness
he dared
the hills of the dead



  as he progressed he noted an occasional
lion spoor but there seemed to be no ani-
mals in the grasslands-none that left
tracks at any rate vultures sat like black
brooding images in some of the stunted
trees and suddenly he saw an activity
among them some distance beyond sev-
eral of the dusky birds circled about a
clump of high grass dipping then rising
again some beast of prey was defending
his kill against them kane decided and
wondered at the lack of snarling and roar-
ing which usually accompanied such
scenes his curiosity was roused and he
turned his steps in that direction

  at last pushing through the grass which
rose about his shoulders he saw as
through a corridor walled with the rank
waving blades a ghastly sight the corpse
of a black man lay face down and as the
englishman looked a great dark snake
rose and slid away into the grass moving
so quickly that kane was unable to decide
its nature but it had a weird human-like
suggestion about it

  kane stood over the body noting that
while the limbs lay awry as if broken the
flesh was not torn as a lion or leopard
would have torn it he glanced up at the
whirling vultures and was amazed to see
several of them skimming along close to
the earth following a waving of the grass
which marked the flight of the thing
which had presumably slain the black
man kane wondered what thing the car-
rion birds which eat only the dead were
hunting through the grasslands but
africa is full of never - explained mys-
teries

  kane shrugged his shoulders and lifted
his musket again adventures he had had
in plenty since he parted from nlonga
some moons agone but still that nameless
paranoid urge had driven him on and on
deeper and deeper into those trackless

ways kane could not have analyzed this
call he would have attributed it to satan
who lures men to their destruction but
it was but the restless turbulent spirit of
the adventurer the wanderer-the same
urge which sends the gipsy caravans about
the world which drove the viking galleys
over unknown seas and which guides the
flights of the wild geese

  kane sighed here in this barren land
seemed neither food nor water but he had
wearied unto death of the dank rank
venom of the thick jungle even a wil-
derness of bare hills was preferable for a
time at least he glanced at them where
they lay brooding in the sun and started
forward again

  he held nlongas fetish stave in his
left hand and though his conscience still
troubled him for keeping a thing so ap-
parently diabolic in nature he had never
been able to bring himself to throw it
away

  now as he went toward the hills a
sudden commotion broke out in the tall
grass in front of him which was in
places taller than a man a thin high-
pitched scream sounded and on its heels
an earth-shaking roar the grass parted
and a slim figure came flying toward him
like a wisp of straw blown on the wind
-a brown-skinned girl clad only in a
skirt-like garment behind her some
yards away but gaining swiftly came a
huge lion

  the girl fell at kanes feet with a wail
and a sob and lay clutching at his ankles
the englishman dropped the voodoo
stave raised his musket to his shoulder
and sighted coolly at the ferocious feline
face which neared him every instant
crash the girl screamed once and
slumped on her face the huge cat


weird tales

leaped high and wildly to fall and lie
motionless

kane reloaded hastily before he
 spared a glance at the form at his
feet the girl lay as still as the lion he
had just slain but a quick examination
showed that she had only fainted

  he bathed her face with water from
his canteen and presently she opened her
eyes and sat up fear flooded her face as
she looked at her rescuer and she made
to rise

  kane held out a restraining hand and
she cowered down trembling the roar
of his heavy musket was enough to
frighten any native who had never be-
fore seen a white man kane reflected

  the girl was a much higher type than
the thick-lipped bestial west coast ne-
groes to whom kane had been used she
was slim and finely formed of a deep
brown hue rather than ebony her nose
was straight and thin-bridged her lips
were not too thick somewhere in her
blood there was a strong berber strain

  kane spoke to her in a river dialect a
simple language he had learned during
his wandering and she replied haltingly
the inland tribes traded slaves and ivory
to the river people and were familiar
with their jargon

  my village is there she answered
kanes question pointing to the southern
jungle with a slim rounded arm my
name is zunna my mother whipped me
for breaking a cooking-kettle and i ran
away because i was angry i am afraid
let me go back to my mother

  you may go said kane but i will
take you child suppose another lion
came along you were very foolish to
run away

  she whimpered a little are you not
a god

  no zunna i am only a man though
the color of my skin is not as yours lead
me now to your village

   she rose hesitantly eyeing him appre-
hensively through the wild tangle of her
hair to kane she seemed like some
frightened young animal she led the
way and kane followed she indicated
that her village lay to the southeast and
their route brought them nearer to the
hills the sun began to sink and the
roaring of lions reverberated over the
grasslands kane glanced at the west-
ern sky this open country was no place
in which to be caught by night he
glanced toward the hills and saw that
they were within a few hundred yards
of the nearest he saw what seemed to
be a cave

  zunna said he haltingly we can
never reach your village before nightfall
and if we bide here the lions will take
us yonder is a cavern where we may

spend the night--

  she shrank and trembled

  not in the hills master she whim-
pered better the lions

  nonsense his tone was impatient
he had had enough of native superstition
we will spend the night in yonder
cave

  she argued no further but followed
him they went up a short slope and
stood at the mouth of the cavern a small
affair with sides of solid rock and a
floor of deep sand	

  gather some dry grass zunna com-
manded kane standing his musket
against the wall at the mouth of the
cave but go not far away and listen for
lions i will build here a fire which shall
keep us safe from beasts tonight bring
the hills of the dead



some grass and any twigs you may find
like a good child and we will sup i
have dried meat in my pouch and water
also

  she gave him a strange long glance
then turned away without a word kane
tore up grass near at hand noting how
it was seared and crisp from the sun and
heaping it up struck flint and steel
flame leaped up and devoured the heap
in an instant he was wondering how
he could gather enough grass to keep a
fire going all night when he was aware
that he had visitors

  kane was used to grotesque sights
but at first glance he started and a slight
coldness traveled down his spine two
black men stood before him in silence
they were tall and gaunt and entirely
naked their skins were a dusty black
tinged with a gray ashy hue as of death
their faces were different from any ne-
groes he had seen the brows were
high and narrow the noses huge and
snout-like the eyes were inhumanly large
and inhumanly red as the two stood
there it seemed to kane that only their
burning eyes lived

  he spoke to them but they did not
answer he invited them to eat with a
motion of his hand and they silently
squatted down near the cave mouth as
far from the dying embers of the fire as
they could get

  kane turned to his pouch and began
taking out the strips of dried meat which
he carried once he glanced at his silent
guests it seemed to him that they were
watching the glowing ashes of his fire
rather than him

  the sun was about to sink behind the
western horizon a red fierce glow
spread over the grasslands so that all
seemed like a waving sea of blood kane

knelt over his pouch and glancing up
saw zunna come around the shoulder of
the hill with her arms full of grass and
dry branches

  as he looked her eyes flared wide
the branches dropped from her arms and
her scream knifed the silence fraught
with terrible warning kane whirled on
his knee two great black forms loomed
over him as he came up with the lithe
motion of a springing leopard the
fetish stave was in his hand and he drove
it through the body of the nearest foe
with a force which sent its sharp point
out between the negros shoulders then
the long lean arms of the other locked
about him and white man and black
man went down together

  the talon-like nails of the black were
tearing at his face the hideous red eyes
staring into his with a terrible threat as
kane writhed about and fending off the
clawing hands with one arm drew a pis-
tol he pressed the muzzle close against
the blacks side and pulled the trigger
at the muffled report the negros body
jerked to the concussion of the bullet
but the thick lips merely gaped in a hor-
rid grin

  one long arm slid under kanes shoul-
ders the other hand gripped his hair
the englishman felt his head being
forced back irresistibly he clutched at
the others wrist with both hands but the
flesh under his frantic fingers was as hard
as wood kanes brain was reeling his
neck seemed ready to break with a little
more pressure he threw his body back-
ward with one volcanic effort breaking
the deathly hold the black was on him
and the talons were clutching again
kane found and raised the empty pistol
and he felt the black mans skull cave in
like a shell as he brought down the long


weird tales

barrel with all his strength and once
again the writhing lips parted in fearful
mockery

  and now a near panic clutched kane
what sort of man was this who still
menaced his life with tearing fingers
after having been shot and mortally
bludgeoned no man surely but one of
the sons of satan at the thought kane
wrenched and heaved explosively and
the close-locked combatants tumbled
across the earth to come to a rest in the
smoldering ashes before the cave mouth
kane barely felt the heat but the mouth
of his foe gaped this time in seeming
agony the frightful fingers loosened
their hold and kane sprang clear

  the black man with his shattered skull
was rising on one hand and one knee
when kane struck returning to the attack
as a gaunt wolf returns to a wounded
bison from the side he leaped landing
full on the black giants back his steely
arms seeking and finding a deadly
wrestling hold and as they went to the
earth together he broke the negros neck
so that the hideous dead face looked back
over one shoulder the black man lay
still but to kane it seemed that he was
not dead even tken for the red eyes still
burned with their grisly light

  the englishman turned to see the girl
crouching against the cave wall he
looked for his stave it lay in a heap of
dust among which were a few molder-
ing bones he stared his brain reeling
then with one stride he caught up the
voodoo staff and turned to the fallen
negro his face set in grim lines as he
raised it then he drove it through the
black breast and before his eyes the
giant body crumbled dissolving to dust
as he watched horror-struck even as had
crumbled he through whom kane had
first thrust the stave

	dream magic

      reatgod whispered kane these
vj men were dead vampires this
is satans handiwork manifested

  zunna crawled to his knees and clung
there

  these be walking dead men mas-
ter she whimpered i should have
warned you

  why did they not leap on my back
when they first came asked he

  they feared the fire they were wait-
ing for the embers to die entirely
whence came they

  from the hills hundreds of their
kind swarm among the boulders and
caverns of these hills and they live on
human life for a man they will slay de-
vouring his ghost as it leaves his quiver-
ing body aye they are suckers of
souls

  master among the greater of these
hills there is a silent city of stone and in
the old times in the days of my ancestors
these people lived there they were hu-
man but they were not as we for they
had ruled this land for ages and ages
the ancestors of my people made war on
them and slew many and their magicians
made all the dead men as these were at
last all died

  and for ages have they preyed on the
tribes of the jungle stalking down from
the hills at midnight and at sunset to
haunt the jungle-ways and slay and slay
men and beasts flee them and only fire
will destroy them

  here is that which will destroy
them said kane grimly raising the voo-
doo stave black magic must fight black
magic and i know not what spell

nlonga put hereon but-

  you are a god said zunna decided-
ly no man could overcome two of the
the hills of the dead



walking dead men master can you not
lift this curse from my tribe there is
nowhere for us to flee and the monsters
slay us at will catching wayfarers out-
side the village wall death is on this
land and we die helpless

  deep in kane stirred the spirit of the
crusader the fire of the zealot-the fa-
natic who devotes his life to battling the
powers of darkness

  let us eat said he then we will
build a great fire at the cave mouth the
fire which keeps away beasts shall also
keep away fiends

  later kane sat just inside the cave
chin rested on clenched fist eyes gazing
unseeingly into the fire behind in the
shadows zunna watched him awed

  god of hosts kane muttered
grant me aid my hand it is which must
lift the ancient curse from this dark land
how am i to fight these dead fiends
who yield not to mortal weapons fire
will destroy them-a broken neck ren-
ders them helpless-the voodoo stave
thrust through them crumbles them to
dust-but of what avail how may i
prevail against the hundreds who haunt
these hills and to whom human life-
essence is life have not-as zunna
says-warriors come against them in the
past only to find them fled to their high-
walled city where no man can come
against them

  the night wore on zunna slept her
cheek pillowed on her round girlish
arm the roaring of the lions shook the
hills and still kane sat and gazed brood-
ingly into the fire outside the night
was alive with whispers and rustlings
and stealthily soft footfalls and at times
kane glancing up from his meditations
seemed to catch the gleam of great red
eyes beyond the flickering light of the fire

  gray dawn was stealing over the grass-
lands when kane shook zunna into wake-
fulness

  god have mercy on my soul for delv-
ing in barbaric magic said he but de-
monry must be fought with demonry
mayhap tend ye the fire and awake me
if aught untoward occur

  kane lay down on his back on die
sand floor and laid the voodoo staff on
his breast folding his hands upon it
he fell asleep instantly and sleeping
he dreamed to his slumbering self it
seemed that he walked through a thick
fog and in this fog he met n longa true
to life nlonga spoke and the words
were clear and vivid impressing them-
selves on his consciousness so deeply as
to span the gap between sleeping and
waking

  send this girl to her village soon
after sun-up when the lions have gone
to their lairs said nlonga and bid
her bring her lover to you at this cave
there make him lie down as if to slum-
ber holding the voodoo stave

  the dream faded and kane awoke
suddenly wondering how strange and
vivid had been the vision and how
strange to hear nlonga talking in eng-
lish without the jargon kane shrugged
his shoulders he knew that nlonga
claimed to possess the power of sending
his spirit through space and he himself
had seen the voodoo man animate a dead

mans body still-

  zunna said kane giving the prob-
lem up i will go with you as far as
the edge of the jungle and you must go
on to your village and return here to this
cave with your lover

  kran she asked naively

  whatever his name is eat and we
will go 


weird tales

again the sun slanted toward the west
lkane sat in the cave waiting he
had seen the girl safely to the place
where the jungle thinned to the grass-
lands and though his conscience stung
him at the thought of the dangers which
might confront her he sent her on alone
and returned to the cave he sat now
wondering if he would not be damned
to everlasting flames for tinkering with
the magic of a black sorcerer blood-
brother or not

   light footfalls sounded and as kane
reached for his musket zunna entered
accompanied by a tall splendidly pro-
portioned youth whose brown skin
showed that he was of the same race as
the girl his soft dreamy eyes were
fixed on kane in a sort of awesome wor-
ship evidently the girl had not minim-
ized the white gods glory in her telling

   he bade the youth lie down as he di-
rected and placed the voodoo stave in his
hands zunna crouched at one side
wide-eyed kane stepped back half
ashamed of this mummery and wonder-
ing what if anything would come of it
then to his horror the youth gave one
gasp and stiffened

   zunna screamed bounding erect

   you have killed kran she shrieked
flying at the englishman who stood struck
speechless

  then she halted suddenly wavered
drew a hand languidly across her brow

-	she slid down to lie with her arms
about the motionless body of her lover

  and this body moved suddenly made
aimless motions with hands and feet then
sat up disengaging itself from the cling-
ing arms of the still senseless girl

  kran looked up at kane and grinned
a sly knowing grin which seemed out of
place on his face somehow kane start-

ed those soft eyes had changed in ex-
pression and were now hard and glitter-
ing and snaky-nlongas eyes

  at ya said kran in a grotesquely
familiar voice blood-brother you got
no greeting for nlonga

  kane was silent his flesh crawled in
spite of himself kran rose and stretched
his arms in an unfamiliar sort of way as
if his limbs were new to him he slapped
his breast approvingly

  me nlonga said he in the old
boastful manner mighty ju-ju man
blood-brother not you know me eh
you are satan said kane sincerely
are you kran or are you nlonga
me nlonga assured the other
my body sleep in ju-ju hut on coast
many treks from here i borrow krans
body for while my ghost travel ten
days march in one breath twenty days
march in same time my ghost go out
from my body and drive out krans
and kran is dead

  no he no dead i send his ghost to
shadowland for a while-send the girls
ghost too to keep him company bimeby
come back

  this is the work of the devil said
kane frankly but i have seen you do
even fouler magic-shall i call you
nlonga or kran

  kran-kah me nlonga-bodies
like clothes me nlonga in here now
he rapped his breast bimeby kran
live along here-then he be kran and i
be nlonga same like before kran no
live along now nlonga live along this
one fellow body blood-brother i am
nlonga

  kane nodded this was in truth a land
of horror and enchantment anything was
possible even that the thin voice of
nlonga should speak to him from the
the hills of the dead



great chest of kran and the snaky eyes
of nlonga should blink at him from
the handsome young face of kran

  this land i know long time said
nlonga getting down to business
mighty ju-ju these dead people no
no need to waste one fellow time-i
know-i talk to you in sleep my blood-
brother want to kill out these dead black
fellows eh

    tis a thing opposed to nature said
kane somberly they are known in my
land as vampires-i never expected to
come upon a whole nation of them

	the silent city

 v t ow we find this stone city said
  jln nlonga

yes why not send your ghost out to
kill these vampires kane asked idly

   ghost got to have one fellow body to
work in nlonga answered sleep
now tomorrow we start

  the sun had set the fire glowed and
flidkered in the cave mouth kane
glanced at the still form of the girl who
lay where she had fallen and prepared
himself for slumber

 awake me at midnight he admon-
ished and i will watch from then until
dawn

 but when nlonga finally shook his
arm kane awoke to see the first light of
dawn reddening the land

   time we start said the fetish-man
   but the girl-are you sure she lives
   she live blood-brother

  then in gods name we can not leave
her here at the mercy of any prowling
fiend who might chance upon her or

some lion might-

  no lion come vampire scent still
linger mixed with man scent one fel-
low lion he no like man scent and he fear

the walking dead men no beast come
and-lifting the voodoo stave and laying
it across the cave entrance-no dead man
come now

  kane watched him somberly and with-
out enthusiasm

  how will that rod safeguard her
that mighty ju-ju said nlonga
you see how one fellow vampire go
along dust alongside that stave no vam-
pire dare touch or come near it i gave it
to you because outside vampire hills one
fellow man sometimes meet a corpse
walking in jungle when shadows be
black not all walking dead men be here
and all must suck life from men-if not
they rot like dead wood

  then make many of these rods and
arm the people with them

  no can do nlongas skull shook
violently that ju-ju rod be mighty
magic old old no man live today can
tell how old that fellow ju-ju stave be i
make my blood-brother sleep and do
magic with it to guard him that time we
make palaver in coast village today we
scout and run no need it leave it here
to guard girl

  kane shrugged his shoulders and fol-
lowed the fetish-man after glancing back
at the still shape which lay in the cave
he would never have agreed to leave her
so casually had he not believed in his
heart that she was dead he had touched
her and her flesh was cold

  they went up among the barren hills
as the sun was rising higher they
climbed up steep clay slopes winding
their way through ravines and between
great boulders the hills were honey-
combed with dark forbidding caves and
these they passed warily and kanes
flesh crawled as he thought of the grisly
occupants therein for nlonga said


weird tales

  them vampires he sleep in caves
most all day till sunset them caves he
be full of one fellow dead man

  the sun rose higher baking down on
the bare slopes with an intolerable heat
silence brooded like an evil monster over
the land they had seen nothing but
kane could have sworn at times that a
black shadow drifted behind a boulder
at their approach

  them vampires they stay hid in day-
time said nlonga with a low laugh
they be afraid of one fellow vulture
no fool vulture he know death when
he see it he pounce on one fellow dead
man and tear and eat if he be lying or
walking

  a strong shudder shook his com-
panion

  great god kane cried striking his
thigh with his hat is there no end to
the horror of this hideous land truly
this land is dedicated to the powers of
darkness

  kanes eyes burned with a dangerous
light the terrible heat the solitude and
the knowledge of the horrors lurking on
either hand were shaking even his steely
nerves

  keep on one fellow hat blood-
brother admonished nlonga with a
low gurgle of amusement that fellow
sun he knock you dead suppose you no
look out

  kane shifted the musket he had in-
sisted on bringing and made no reply
they mounted an eminence at last and
looked down on a sort of plateau and
in the center of this plateau was a silent
city of gray and crumbling stone kane
was smitten by a sense of incredible age
as he looked the walls and houses were
of great stone blocks yet they were fall-
ing into ruin grass grew on the plateau

and high in the streets of that dead city
kane saw no movement among the ruins

  that is their city-why do they choose
to sleep in caves

  maybe-so one fellow stone fall on
them from roof and crush them stone
huts he fall down bimeby maybe-so
they no like to stay together-maybe-so
they eat each other too

  silence whispered kane how it
hangs over all

  them vampires no talk nor yell they
dead they sleep in caves wander at sun-
set and at night maybe-so them black
fellow bush tribes come with spears them
vampires go to stone kraal and fight
behind walls

  kane nodded the crumbling walls
which surrounded that dead city were
still high and solid enough to resist the
attack of spearmen-especially when de-
fended by these snout-nosed fiends

  blood-brother said nlonga sol-
emnly i have mighty magic thought be
silent a little while

kane seated himself on a boulder and
 gazed broodingly at the bare crags
and slopes which surrounded them far
away to the south he saw the leafy green
ocean that was the jungle distance lent
a certain enchantment to the scene closer
at hand loomed the dark blotches that
were the mouths of the caves of horror

  nlonga was squatting tracing some
strange pattern in the clay with a dagger
point kane watched him thinking how
easy they might fall victim to the vam-
pires if even three or four of the fiends
should come out of their caverns and
even as he thought it a black and horrific
shadow fell across the crouching fetish-
man

kane acted without conscious thought
the hills of the dead



he shot from the boulder where he sat
like a stone hurled from a catapult and
his musket stock shattered the face of the
hideous black thing who had stolen upon
them back and back kane drove his in-
human foe staggering never giving him
time to halt or launch an offensive batter-
ing him with the onslaught of a frenzied
tiger

  at the very edge of the cliff the vam-
pire wavered then pitched back over to
fall for a hundred feet and lie writhing
on the rocks of the plateau below
nlonga was on his feet pointing the
hills were giving up their dead

  out of the caves they were swarming
the terrible black silent shapes up the
slopes they came charging and over the
boulders they came clambering and their
red eyes were all turned toward the two
humans who stood above the silent city
the caves belched them forth in an un-
holy judgment day

  nlonga pointed to a crag some dis-
tance away and with a shout started run-
ning fleetly toward it kane followed
from behind boulders black-taloned
hands clawed at them tearing their gar-
ments they raced past caves and mum-
mied monsters came lurching out of the
dark gibbering silently to join in the
pursuit

  the dead hands were close at their
back when they scrambled up the last
slope and stood on a ledge which was the
top of the crag the fiends halted silently
a moment then came clambering after
them kane clubbed his musket and
smashed down into the red-eyed faces
knocking aside the upleaping hands they
surged up like a black wave he swung
his musket in a silent fury that matched
theirs the black wave broke and
wavered back came on again

  he-could-not-kill-them these
words beat on his brain like a sledge on
an anvil as he shattered wood-like flesh
and dead bone with his smashing swings
he knocked them down hurled them
back but they rose and came on again
this could not last-what in gods name
was nlonga doing kane spared one
swift tortured glance over his shoulder
the fetish-man stood on the highest part
of the ledge head thrown back arms
lifted as if in invocation

  kanes vision blurred to the sweep of
hideous black faces with red staring eyes
those in front were horrible to see now
for their skulls were shattered their faces
caved in and their limbs broken but
still they came on and those behind
reached across their shoulders to clutch at
the man who defied them

  kane was red but the blood was all his
from the long-withered veins of those
monsters no single drop of warm red
blood trickled suddenly from behind
him came a long piercing wail -
nlonga over the crash of the flying
musket-stock and the shattering of bones
it sounded high and clear-the only voice
lifted in that hideous fight

  the black wave washed about kanes
feet dragging him down keen talons
tore at him flaccid lips sucked at his
wounds he reeled up again disheveled
and bloody clearing a space with a shat-
tering sweep of his splintered musket
then they closed in again and he went
down

  this is the end he thought but even
at that instant the press slackened and the
sky was suddenly filled with the beat of
great wings

  then he was free and staggered up
blindly and dizzily ready to renew the

russell dived sharply from the
yawls deck as the last great wave
 struck and submerged it he rose
and sank in the foam-churned surf then
rose again and with great strokes fought
toward the shoreline he could glimpse
through the spray the waters were thun-
derous in his ears and behind him the
descending sun lit the world with cop-
pery fire

  as he struggled on russell was aware
by brief glimpses that the beach ahead was
nearer the giant waves from behind bore
him forward toward it in great leaps but
the deadly undertow gripped his feet with
serpent grasp to pull him back he kicked
struggled and at last felt firm sand
beneath his feet and staggered up onto

it beyond the clawing grasp of the waves

  he looked about him dazed for a
moment by his struggle with the furious
ocean he was standing on the beach of
an island some three miles in length its
surface clothed green with sycamore and
oak and brush sloped gently up to higher
ground at the islands center

  a sound came to russells ears over
the roar of the surf and he half turned
down from the islands wooded center by
a narrow path a shirt-sleeved and hatless
man was hastening toward him as he
approached russell saw that he wras
over middle age with quick eyes and a
keen intellectual countenance beneath his
graying hair his face held anxiety as he
came closer hand outstretched

weird tales

  my dear sir i saw your boat founder-
ing from my place-but it seems it was all
over before i got here youre not hurt
more chagrined than hurt russell
managed to smile they told me over in
charleston that if i went too far out from
the coast the squalls would get me but i
thought i could pull the yawl through
them

  the other seemed relieved well it
was as narrow an escape as ive ever seen
these squalls are treacherous and if you

hadnt been near this island-

  it was just dumb luck that i was
russell admitted and i never looked to
find anyone here until you appeared most
of the islands this far off the carolina
coast are uninhabited arent they

  most of them are said the other
but this one happens to be the site of the
northern university biological station
youve heard of it perhaps

  of course russell was interested
over in charleston i heard

  im dr james garland the bio-
chemist of the station and just now its
only member the other introduced him-
self there are ordinarily a half-dozen
of us here--dr wallace the head pro-
fessor lowerman and three others but
theyve all gone off to charleston for a
vacation and im the unlucky one who
stays here to tend their routine-work while
theyre gone

  russells my name the younger man
replied just one of new yorks strug-
gling young attorneys on a trip south in
a yawl that i always thought until now i
could manage

  dr garland smiled im afraid youll
have to put in a few days here with me
until the others get back for they went
in our only boat if you can put up with

a somewhat irregular one-man house-
hold-

  crusoes cant be choosers russell
told him besides-ive heard something
about this station-im really glad of the
opportunity to visit it

  well youd better begin your visit by
changing to dry clothes observed the
other lowermans about your size-
im sure hed be glad to lend you anything
of his if he were here

  he led the way across the beach and
along the narrow path that twisted up-
ward through the spring-green woods
the sun was sinking lower behind them
and the keen sea-wind striking russells
dripping garments soon had his teeth
chattering he was glad enough when
they came out onto the more sparsely
wooded plateau that was the islands high-
est part and glimpsed the squat frame
bungalow and the long and broad un-
painted frame building some distance
behind it

  the laboratories garland gestured
toward the latter structure ill show you
all over them later but just now the
quicker you change the better

  russell followed him into the bun-
galow and across a roomy living-room
with comfortable masculine furnishings
to one of the bedrooms at the rear there
the bio-chemist dug from a mass of care-
lessly piled clothing and impedimenta a
set of garments that were well-worn but
dry and warm when garland left him
with them darkness was falling and
russell switched on the lights

  arrayed in the dry clothes he ventured
back into the living-room and found dr
garland busy with rolled-up sleeves in the
surprizingly neat little kitchen russell
proficient in a boats galley helped him
prepare the meal that they were soon
pigmy island



falling upon their only conversation the
occasional monosyllables of hungry men
at table

sitting before the blazing fireplace a
little later and smoking one of the
cigarettes his host had proffered russell
reflected that there were indisputably
worse places over the whine of winds
outside there came to his ears the dim
thunder of the distant surf he hitched
his chair closer to the comforting fire

  im really immensely interested in
your place here he told the other i
heard quite a bit about it over in charles-
ton

  all of it good asked his host quiz-
zically and russell grinned

  well as a matter of fact some of them
did talk a good bit of rot about you and
your friends they had some melodra-
matic whispers about something pretty
diabolical going on out here and i
gathered that youre all regarded as so
many twentieth century friar bacons by
a good many of them

  garland laughed blowing smoke from
his cigarette friar bacons a good exam-
ple he said the ignorance of modern
people is often amazing and the mere fact
that we came to this lonely spot to set up
our research station was enough to let
those good people know that we were up
to something that we wanted to keep
hidden

  it is a rather unusual spot for a re-
search station isnt it

  not at all garland promptly dis-
claimed the main purpose of this sta-
tion is to make an exhaustive study of
the evolutionary differences between some
of the lower invertebrate sea-creatures
for that reason a sea-location with varied
depths and conditions is necessary so
when we started the station we persuaded

the university to let us come here of
course we all have our own side-lines here
still-wallace has his chromosomes and
snelling his cell-theory and i my size-
changing work-but weve all got to
spend most of our time on the stations
main research or the university wouldnt
support it long

  russell caught at one of his phrases
your size-changing work

  the bio-chemist waved his cigarette
my pet hobby ive been able to stimu-
late the pituitarys functioning to an un-
heard-of degree or to halt it almost alto-
gether of course control is still rather
a problem

  im afraid youll think me deplorably
ignorant russell said but that means
as much to me as algebra to a hottentot
garland laughed these schools
what do they teach you nowadays well
the things simple enough in theory you
know i suppose that the size of a human
or animal body is directly dependent on
the functioning of its pituitary gland

  i seem to have heard something about
a gland controlling the bodys size rus-
sell admitted

  no doubt said garland dryly well
the pituitary gland which is located near
the center of the head does actually con-
trol the size of the body by its secretions
if it secretes normally your body is of
normal size if it secretes more than nor-
mally you are a giant if less than nor-
mally you are a dwarf now since that
fact became known-i hope you will par-
don my classroom manner but for years
i dinned these facts into sophomores-
since that fact became known biologists
over all the world have been attempting
an artificial regulation of the bodys size
by means of it that is they have sought
to stimulate or lessen the glands secre-


weird tales

tions and so increase or decrease the
bodys size

  this experimentation has been on the
whole rather fruitless so far its true that
by tampering with the gland biologists
have been able to make some animals a
little larger or smaller than normal but
thats all theyve been able to accomplish
-a mere stunting or hastening of growth
the fact is that the ductless glands like
the pituitary and thyroid are such delicate
organisms that when we tamper with them
surgically we damage them nine times out
of ten i became aware of that years ago
so left it off and started working from a
different point of attack

 i have- garland suddenly

halted rising to his feet grasping a
heavy stick of firewood he stepped softly
to the door then flung it suddenly open

  russell amazed heard the quick
scurrying of something on the veranda
outside as the door was flung open for a
moment garland gazed intently out into
the darkness then closed the door

  damn them-they get bolder every
day he exclaimed angrily

  rats asked russell and the other
looked over at him and nodded

  and cursed annoying ones too he
said irritably under the house and
laboratory and all around them yet you
cant lay hands on them at all

  his brow cleared as he resumed his
seat where was i oh yes well as
i was saying ive gone at this problem
of influencing the pituitary gland in a
different way i said to myself why cut
open the head and take immense risks to
reach the gland when through the blood
that nourishes it we can reach it easily i
said what if i devise a compound which
when injected into the blood-stream will
in time flow through the pituitary gland

and excite it into unheard-of activity
and what if i work out an opposite com-
pound that will reach the gland in the
same way through the blood but that
instead of stimulating will halt or almost
halt its functioning you perceive what
that would mean

  russells brow puckered why good
lord he exclaimed that would en-
able you to increase or decrease the bodys
size at will

   garland bowed you see it so i set
to work devising the two necessary com-
pounds the thing seemed clear in
theory but i dont mind saying that its
proved cursed difficult in actual fact na-
tures a mistress whose work is mighty
hard to change but ive plugged away
at the university and here until i have
the formulas for my two compounds all
worked out and have been able to make
enough of them to prove their efficacy
beyond any doubt

   i take a dog for instance i inject into
one of his arteries leading into the head
the stimulating compound soon that
compound carried by the blood-stream
reaches the pituitary gland and at once
by reason of its irritant effect upon the
gland spurs it to tremendous activity it
throws its secretions into the dogs body
at a terrific rate i may say parenthetically
that the injection produces coma almost
at once in the subject within a day that
dog lying in coma will have increased in
bodily size to a giant dog six times its
normal stature if the stimulating com-
pound has been injected in sufficient quan-
tity it will wake as a giant dog and will
remain that size indefinitely the com-
pound in the gland stimulating it un-
ceasingly until neutralized by the op-
posing compound

  you will say that dog increases six
pigmy island



times in actual bulk and weight in its day
of coma how can that be i ask in turn
how did the dog increase from a small
puppy to a full-grown dog in a year it
did so because in the food it ate and the
air it breathed it took in food elements
that its body-organism turned into tissue
had it breathed more or eaten more it
would not have grown faster for the body
organism can only assimilate the food-
elements at a certain rate and that rate
is directly dependent upon the secretions
of the vital pituitary gland

  but by immensely increasing their
secretions i have immensely accelerated
the rate at which the body-organism can
assimilate food-elements the sleeping
dog in its coma does not eat but it
breathes the air it breadies contains in
itself and in its carbon dioxid and water-
vapor all the vital food-elements of ox-
ygen nitrogen carbon and hydrogen
these elements are assimilated thus from
the breathed air by the body-organism at
a tremendous rate cells forming into
tissue and bone at incredible speed build-
ing up a body several times the size of
the normal body

  if the opposite compound were in
jetted it would slow the secretion of the
pituitary gland and with that vital func-
tion almost halted the body would begin
to throw off its own tissues with immense
speed by the familiar waste-processes of
exhalation of air and perspiration it would
throw off matter from itself at an un-
heard-of rate until it had reached a size
consonant with the reduced functioning
of its vital gland if that compound were
injected thedog would wake from its
coma of a day to find itself but a fifth or
sixth of its normal size that the whole
process would work in exactly the same

way with a human being i have no doubt
whatever

  russell shook his head and youve
really made those compounds youve
actually tested them on animals

  of course-and with very great suc-
cess but that success will have to be
complete before i can publish

  it seems like something out of fairy-
tales the younger man commented of
course i dont doubt your word-but to
make a living thing greater or smaller in
size-its one of those things youd have
to see to believe

  garland laughed relighting his cig-
arette simple enough he said ill
show you something over in the labora-
tory tomorrow that will make you believe
i could show you tonight but im afraid
your dreams would be rather night-
marish

  speaking of dreams makes me realize
that im half into them now said rus-
sell yawning i dont know why i feel

so sleepy tonight-

  the usual effect of scientific dis-
course commented garland dont
apologize-im used to it-my classrooms
were veritable halls of morpheus when i
got well into a lecture

  much more likely its the effect of my
tough time today replied russell laugh-
ing that same rooms mine for to-
night well i hope ill be wakeful
enough by morning to look at your
experiment

  dont worry you will be retorted
the other smilingly youre the first
society ive had for a week and as such
you cant hope to escape without being
bored mercilessly

russell found himself stretching and
 yawning hugely as he prepared to re-
tire and it seemed to him that his head


weird tales

no sooner rested on the pillow than he
was slipping into sleep he half-heard a
scratching and scurrying somewhere in the
rooms wall or floor but was on the last
rim of consciousness by then and in an-
other moment had drifted off it into
dreamless slumber

  when he came back to wakefulness
his first sensation was of a strange
tingling in all his body accompanied by
a recurring nausea he stirred rubbed his
eyes sat up his movements seeming odd-
ly clumsy to him he opened his eyes
blinking looking around him with an
irritated incomprehension that in a mo-
ment more had changed to stupefaction
his heart leapt uncontrollably

  he was not in bed in the room where
he had retired but was resting quite un-
clothed upon a thick mass of folded
cloths that made a small pallet it rested
directly on the floor but the floor itself
was of smooth glass that was apparently
immensely thick and all around russell
there rose the gleaming walls of a great
glass room illuminated by clear sunlight

  he staggered to his feet uttering an
inarticulate cry for almost a score of
feet above him apparently rose the foot-
thick glass walls in them was no door or
window or opening of any kind they
came to an end above with the glass
rooms ceiling or roof quite open and
roofless russell stumbled to the glass
wall of his strange prison and gazed
dazedly through it

  another hoarse cry came from him for
he was gazing out upon a scene that
seemed at the same time unutterably
familiar yet unutterably strange and
grotesque the great glass room seemed
to rest upon a long gleaming platform
of burnished metal scores of feet in
width and hundreds in length upon it

there rested here and there objects famil-
iar in shape metal and glass beakers and
retorts balance-scales and microscope
but all of size gigantic the microscopes
great tube loomed for twice russells
height into the air he could have hid-
den in the beakers

  he swayed to another of his glass
prisons four walls from it the view
was different-a window a short distance
from the glass wall but the window was
colossal in size too on a scale with the
microscope and beakers through it he
made out the fiery disk of the descending
sun and against it outside swung branches
that seemed of trees huge beyond all
experience

  russell strange sounds in his throat
reached another wall and saw that from
it the view was one of a room a colossal
room of cathedral proportions but rectan-
gular in shape with white walls and
ceiling and with huge tables and chairs
several times his own height ranged
along it and it was on the metal top of
one such enormous table that his square
glass prison rested

  there came to his giving brain a flash
of vague remembrance and comprehen-
sion-garlands talk of the night before
-garlands calm statement of his
powers-and russell his mind sub-
merged in horror sank to the gleaming
floor

  into his stunned brain in the nexr
instant penetrated a great clicking and
clashing sound from the distance that
brought him to his feet in a bound one
of the great doors at the vast rooms end
had swung suddenly open and there had
stepped inside an appalling figure a
man colossal between thirty and forty
feet into the air he seemed to loom a
giant who came toward russells glass
pigmy island



prison with thundering tread and it was
garland garland-his eyes keen with
interest as he bent over the glass en-
closure as his huge head loomed over
the glass rooms open top russell could
only stare upward paralyzed then he
saw the great lips moving and there came
down to him the rumbling thunder that
was garlands voice

tct promised to show you something
jl that would make you believe in my
work russell he was saying well
behold that something-yourself

  garland damn you russell was
sobbing in his rage and terror what
have you done to me made me like this

-	made a pigmy - out of a human
being

  the scientists vast laugh thundered
dont take it so hard russell youre
not the first one to find yourself a foot in
height-wallace and lowerman and the
others of my esteemed co-workers are no
larger than you so youre not alone

  wallace- russell almost forgot

his own terrible situation in that revela-
tion then wallace and the others-
you did the same-

  the same as to you the great voice
rumbled it became suddenly again
thunderous do you think that i would
restrict my theory always to animals and
never try working it out on men men-
the mere raw material of experimentation
to me so many guinea-pigs to aid test-
tube and microscope in the search for
truth his great eyes burned

  i perfected the two compounds two
weeks ago russell i drugged the other
five wallace and snelling and lowerman
and johnson and hall i injected the
gland-depressant compound the size-de-
creasing compound into the neck-arteries
while they lay in that drugged sleep of

course it would have been just as easy to
use the other compound but i knew too
well what their reactions would be when
they woke to try making the unsuspecting
subjects of my experiment giants

  through the next score of hours the
bodies of the five shrank almost visibly
before me their tissues disintegrating
and being thrown off at a terrific rate i
brought them here to the laboratory
when they had ceased shrinking each a
pigmy man hardly a foot in height like
you i had prepared a crude prison for
them and meant to use the size-increas-
ing compound on them when they woke
that way you see i could test it also
without danger of making them large
enough to be formidable to myself they
were dazed and crazy with rage and all
that when they woke of course just as
you are but i counted on making the
second test even if against their will so
many guinea-pigs to me

  but they escaped damn them my
prison for them had been too crude and
they got away in the night got down one
of die rat-holes in the laboratory here and
have been lurking around and under the
place ever since you heard them last
night at the door i hope the rats get
them and they surely will in time - a
foot-high man is no match for a full-
grown rat or snake i assure you

  but i had to have another subject to
go on with the experiment and fate sent
me you russell i would have swum out
into that surf to rescue you if you hadnt
got ashore i wanted you so badly to
work on well you ought to know the
rest you were so sleepy because your
food was drugged last night and in the
twenty-odd hours since then youve had
the size-decreasing compound in your
pituitary have been shrinking in size


weird tales

every minute until youre the magnificent
pigmy proof of my work that you now
are and now i can give the other com-
pound the size-increasing one its final
tests on you

  as garland spoke he placed on the
table and opened a narrow black case it
held two six-inch glass tubes one filled
with a bright red liquid and the other
with a brilliant green one and also a
hypodermic needle of odd design

  russell was raging futilely at the great
head bent above him garland-you
fiend youre mad-mad

  garland was calmly withdrawing the
liquid-tubes from their case quite pos-
sibly he admitted madness and genius
are so closely akin that no one has ever
been able to mark their exact dividing-
line are all madmen merely geniuses of
an order incomprehensible to us an
interesting thought

  but youll go no farther in your in-
sane experiments with me cried russell

  youll do well to remember russell
that on me depends your one chance of
regaining your normal size i make no
promises but-

  russell shook his hand grotesquely
toward the looming giant face no-
ill die this way first garland youve
made a pigmy a monster of me-but
youll get no chance to go farther with
your devilish work on me

  garland slipped the liquid-tubes im-
perturbably back into the case quite
illogical he remarked ill give you
until morning russell and if youre still
so obstinate i think i can bring you to
terms a few large spiders put in with
you-theyd seem rather terrible in size
and ferocity to you really it would be
amusing youd better think k over and

lest you have any hope of getting away

as the others did-

  he drew over the top of the square
glass box a sheet of heavy wire-screen
that he fastened tightly over the boxs top
by means of projecting hasps through
which ran a chain held by a small strong
padlock fastened thus it formed a
strong lattice-work secured over the boxs
top with it in place garland grasped
the black case

  until the morning russell--
russell leaning weakly against the
glass wall of his prison saw garlands
huge form passing down the laboratory
case in hand and departing through the
door he closed behind him

eft alone russell crouched for some
f moments in silence unmoving the
sun was sinking outside he saw for its
level rays were fading and dusk was
beginning to thicken in the laboratorys
corners there came to russell dim
memory of the sunset-how long before
-that had seen him struggling through
the surf toward this island of horror he
strove to think calmly but his thoughts
dissolved with each attempt into un-
reasoning horror

  he rose paced along the wall of his
glass cage then with sudden crazy im-
pulse flung himself against it the im-
pact left him bruised and breathless he
lay for some time panting the shadows
in the laboratory deepening as night came
outside through an opposite window 
though an intensifying flood of silver
moonlight was pouring into the long
room so vast to his diminished per-
ceptions

  russell looked up to where the heavy
screen that garland had fastened over
his glass prison gleamed dully in the
moonlight it seemed more than twenty
pigmy island



feet over his head and it took but a few
futile leaps to convince him that all hope
of touching it even was futile the
smooth and perpendicular glass walls
gave no slightest hold and there was
nothing in his transparent cell to aid him
in climbing there was nothing in fact
but the thick mass of dark cloth on which
he had lain russell tore from it enough
of the stuff to make a clumsy tunic which
he tied around him the garment com-
forted him oddly

  he sat down at last his hope waning
vanishing even were he to escape from
his prison russell told himself only
garland and his size-increasing com-
pound could release him from the more
terrible prison of his pigmy size only
garland-and he knew without shadow
of doubt that whatever promises garland
might make he would never permit him
to leave the island alive much less re-
gain his normal stature

  russell sat on with dull horror and
hopelessness gnawing his mind unheed-
ful of the moonlight that was brilliant
now in the laboratory it picked out
things here and there the flange of the
microscope the handle of a tool the
pans of the balances-and made them
shine dazzlingly to his ears there came
no sound from outside and russell was
only aware of how deep was the silence
in the laboratory when it was broken
finally by a sound

  it was an odd scratching sound from
the laboratorys floor beneath the shadow
of one of the tables russell listened in-
tently

  the sound came again stopped and
then he heard light hesitant footsteps
he rose and sprang silently to the wall of
his glass cell gazing into the laboratory
at first he saw nothing unusual then his

eye caught a movement and he saw that
out from the shadow of the great table
opposite were cautiously advancing two
figures they were men two pigmy men
of the same foot-high stature as himself

  they were quite visible in the bright
moonlight gazing cautiously around both
were dressed in rough tunic-like gar-
ments not unlike his own and both car-
ried what seemed long metal-pointed
spears they halted and russell saw
them gazing up toward his glass prison
he almost uttered a shout but changed
it in time to a loud hiss at the sibilant
call the two waved quickly as though
glimpsing him and then were running
away beneath him along the laboratory
floor and out of sight

  russells heart was pounding had
the two fled for a moment in which his
heart sank he thought so then he saw
them again

   far along his great table a chair stood
close to its edge and the two were clam-
bering up with some difficulty onto this
grasping rungs and leg they pulled
themselves up until they were on the
chairs seat then they were at the harder
task of climbing up one of the rungs of
the back toward the tables level rus-
sell saw them toiling upward the corru-
gations of the rung helping them until
they were level with the tables top a few
inches from diem they clung to the
rung an instant then leaped

  they struck the tables metal top and
collapsed in a heap but almost at once
were up and hastening along the table
toward his prison as they came closer he
saw that one was young his own age
and the other somewhat older both
dark-haired and unshaven men the
spears they carried were in fact slender
wooden rods about eight to ten inches in


weird tales

length to the end of each of which had
been bound with fine wire a small sharp-
pointed nail these were for the foot-
high men heavy and formidable weapons

  the two came to the glass wall
peered inside at him he opened his
mouth to call to them but one shook his
head warningly russell was silent watch-
ing them with pulse throbbing

  they conversed with each other in low
whispers pointing first to the thickness
of the glass wall and then toward the
heavy screen fastened over the boxs top
at last one hurried off along the table
searching for something while the other
began to uncoil a roll of what seemed
strong rope rolled around his body it
was in reality a length of ordinary twine
by the time he had it uncoiled and had
knotted it here and there the other had
returned a short piece of steel wire in
his grasp

  the two grasped it and with a great
effort bent it into the form of a hook in
a moment they had tied the twine-rope to
it then the older of the two whirled the
shining hook around his head and sent it
hurtling upward it curved down and
fell upon the-lattice-screen over the glass
box was dragged along it for a moment
then suddenly caught in one of the
screens openings at once the younger of
the two was climbing upward by the
knots the other holding the rope steady
beneath

  russell saw the climber gain the top
and inspect quickly the chain-fastening
and lock that secured the screen over the
glass cell after a moment he whispered
down to the man below the latter tied
one of his spears to the rope and in an-
other instant the one above had it in his
hands he inserted it in one of the
screens openings pried and levered this

way and that until he had made an open-
ing a few inches across russell was
watching tensely

  then the man above drew up the rope
from outside and let it fall down through
this opening into the glass cells interior
his whispered order was not needed for
in an instant russell had grasped the rope
and was climbing he reached the top
balanced beside the other on the glass
walls edge panting	  -

  youre garlands new experiment
the other was whispering hoarsely
youre the man who came yesterday-
that garland used the compound on
russell panted his name and you
im snelling the other whispered
and thats lowerman down there did
you hear of us i thought garland might
have told you when you woke we saw
you come with him yesterday-we did our
best to warn you but couldnt there are
wallace and johnson and hall besides us
two garlands experiments-pigmies
all of us the others are waiting for you
now	  

  russell struggled for reason but

where-

  down beneath the laboratory snel-
ling whispered we have a place there
-we use the rat-holes and runways to
get about-and wallace sent us after you

-has a plan-

  there was a warning hiss from the
waiting figure beneath and snelling
pulled russell toward the walls edge
drew up and let down the rope again
upon the outer side of the wall russell
slid down it the other close after him

  lowerman hastened to their side his
haggard and unshaven face clear in the
moonlight he grasped russells hands

  weve got to get down to the others
at once he told him in a tense whisper
pigmy island



theres not much time left and we only
have until morning

  until morning repeated the dazed
russell and lowerman nodded swiftly

  its wallaces plan-hell tell you
about it-but weve got to get out of here
now you have the rope snelling good
-theres no time to lose-

russell found himself hastening along
 the long metal surface of table
gleaming in the moonlight with lower-
man and snelling on either side of him
it came to his dazed brain to appreciate
for a moment the utter grotesqueness of
it-that he a pigmy of twelve inches
height should run with two others like
him along the surface of a table a sen-
sation of unreality held him until they
came to the spot where the chair stood
beside the table its back-rungs a few
inches away

  lowerman without hesitating jumped
for the nearest or corner rung and grasped
it clinging at the same time to his spear
sliding down to the chairs seat russell
followed grasping the rung with all his
strength lowering himself to the seat
also snelling was but an instant behind
him and already lowerman was clamber-
ing down from the seat to the floor in
another minute they all stood there

  without hesitating the other two hur-
ried russell across the floor a vast wooden
plain to his eyes and into the lightless
shadow beneath the great opposite table
they reached the wall fumbled along its
juncture with the floor until lowermans
whisper indicated that he had found what
he sought as russells eyes became a
little accustomed to the darkness beneath
the table he saw that lowerman and
snelling had brought him to a round
ragged hole that had apparently been
gnawed through the wooden strip at the

walls base it was in reality he knew
but a few inches across but seemed to
him that many feet

  lowerman had already stooped was
wriggling through the hole and disap-
pearing into the still deeper darkness
inside his whisper came out to russell
but the latter shrank back snelling
though grasped his shoulder

  its the only way russell straight on
-weve used these rat-holes for the last
two weeks

  russell mastered his instinctive terror
stooped and wriggled through also he
found himself in darkness absolute and
felt in a moment the touch of lowermans
hands a scraping sound told him that
snelling was beside them

  there was a loud scratch and splutter
and a bright light flamed abruptly beside
him lowerman held in his hand what
seemed a short wooden cane burning
brightly at one end it was only when
he suddenly remembered his own present
pigmy size that russell recognized the
burning cane as an ordinary match

  the flame illuminated the place in
which they stood the interior of the wall
it seemed a narrow long hall whose walls
towered up to colossal heights into the
darkness above lowerman had fumbled
for something on the floor producing
finally a crudely shaped and thick little
piece of candle with the great match he
lit it and as its light replaced that of the
expiring match he motioned russell on-
ward with lowerman leading holding
the lighted candle-piece they started
along the vast-walled narrow corridor
that was the walls interior russell
fought against his sense of utter unreality
as they went forward

  they moved on until russell estimated
that they must be approaching the corner


weird tales

of the wall he wondered whither
lowerman was leading he wondered-

  snelling-back

  as lowermans tense whisper hissed
the three sprang back as though plucked
by a great hand russell heard from
ahead a strange rushing loping sound
then a confused deep squeaking grunt
that froze his blood lowerman had
thrust the candle-piece into his hands
had sprung forward with snelling their
spears level russell glimpsed one-or
was it two-great dark shapes ahead of
them just beyond the range of the can-
dles light saw the gleam of quick eyes
then a swift rush of feet as the things
sprang

  there were two of them twin mon-
strous shapes that russell could not recog-
nize as rats despite his brains assurance
fully half his own height they towered
with bodies as long as he was high great
fur-clad monsters whose eyes were
gleaming and whose open jaws were
white-fanged and snarling as they sprang
he felt the impact of their rush saw
snelling go down and lowerman
knocked to his knees as they thrust at the
onrushing beasts with their spears

  one of the huge rats squealed as
lowermans long nail spearhead sank to
its depth into its body russell glimpsed
lowerman braced against the floor
thrusting the spear deeper into the thing
as its great furry body flexed and stiffened
convulsively against the wall but snell-
ing was down beneath the other the great
jaws at his throat russell a madness
of combat on him threw himself for-
ward thrust the lighted candle in his
hand against the beasts side

  there was a sickening smell of burnt
hair and flesh instantly and the beast
whirled with a squealing snarl upon rus-

sell he dodged sidewise felt the needle-
pain of fangs closing on his thigh then
felt those fangs unclosing almost instant-
ly he staggered up saw that snelling
and lowerman were driving their already
bloody spears again and again into the
second rats body as russell stumbled to
his feet the great rat lay still its paws
slowly closing and unclosing russell felt
lowerman and snelling at his side found
himself laughing weakly

  fighting with rats in a wall fighting
death-combats with rats inside a wall

  steady russell lowerman clutched
his shoulder weve got to go on-your
legs not hurt bad

  russell shook his head weakly it
didnt have even a good hold on me but
lets go on then-for gods sake jers
go on

  rats-more bold every day-

snelling was panting as they hurried for-
ward again not afraid now of the
candle-fire even-almost took johnsons
arm off two days ago-

  down here russell lowerman
directed

  they had come to a gnawed aperture
in the wooden bottom of the wall lower-
man dropped through it russell handed
down the candle and then followed with
snelling

  he found himself in another corridor
but one whose walls were of damp earth
it was narrow and only by stooping could
they go forward in it widi lowerman
ahead and snelling behind again he
moved along it the corridor twisted and
turned to right and left and here and
there was crossed by other earth-tunnels
before coming to each of diese crossings
they waited listening before venturing
ahead	
pigmy island



the earthen tunnel twisted onward
and at last lowerman and snelling
turned with him into a branching cor-
ridor this ended abruptly in a blank
earth wall in which was a single round
opening that seemed a few feet across

  lowerman extinguished their candle
and as he did so russell saw that through
the opening from beyond came a faint
yellow light they crawled through the
opening and he found himself in a fairly
large den hollowed in the black earth it
was illuminated by an ordinary candle
burning at its center one that seemed of
enormous size to the pigmy russell

  around this candle less than twice its
height three men awaited them all were
as unshaven and haggard of face as
lowerman and snelling one was big
and white of hair older than the others
another had his shoulder tied in crude
cloth bandages against the dens walls
leaned several of the nail-head spears
some rude couches of cloth and grass
some scraps of food and candle the
smells of damp earth and smoke in the
place were almost overpowering

  the white-haired man had grasped
russells hand i hoped lowerman and
snelling could bring you he was saying
quickly we dared not all venture up-

garlands laid so many traps for us-

  russell dazedly returned the handclasp

then youre-youre-

  wallace-dr fairfield wallace i
am or was head of this research station
this is hall here and this johnson-he
had a pretty bad time of it with a rat in
one of the runways but hes getting better
now

  they crouched down around the can-
dle until he died russell would not for-
get that scene-their six pigmy figures
around the looming candle whose light

flickered across the damp earth walls of
the subterranean den and on the drawn
faces of his companions wallace was
leaning tensely toward him

  russell your name is russell weve
got little time garland is mad he is a
mad genius of science if there can be
such a thing he worked for years on his
gland compounds his size-changing com-
pounds until they have become a mania
or obsession with him his great aim was
to try the compounds on human beings
and thats why he got us to establish our
research station on diis isolated island
though we never guessed it at the time
and once here he drugged us and in-
jected the size-decreasing compound into
us all just as he drugged you and injected
it into you making pigmies of us as he
has of you

  we found ourselves pigmies and we
were in horror of what further fiendish
experiments he might carry out on us so
we managed to escape and get down into
this maze of rat-runways under the lab-
oratory and bungalow the things weve
seen and done here in these last two
weeks russell back home i have a
house a family a position in the scientific
world and im here hiding from rats
and snakes fighting spiders hunting bats
to kill for food

  but no more of that our one aim
in these two weeks has been to get the red
size-increasing compound of garlands
that alone can restore us to our normal
size he colored the two compounds red
and green to distinguish between them
and the red one alone can ever bring us
back from pigmies to men and garland
knows that

  he knows that our one aim is to get
the red compound and he has taken care
that we should not do so the only sup-
 

weird

tales

ply of it is in the tube which he carries
with the other compound and his needle
in that small black case that case never
leaves his person and each night gar-
land has locked himself securely in his
bedroom in the bungalow with the com-
pound-case theres no hope of getting
the case from him while hes awake of
course for in our pigmy size he could
kill all of us with a blow our one
hope is to steal the case while he sleeps

  in the last week we have been bur-
rowing up through the wall toward his
bedroom we have a runway now lead-
ing up from one of the rat-tunnels be-
neath the bungalow to his bedroom
wall and weve only a thin surface of
plaster left to break through now so
tonight-now-were going to try it go-
ing to break through into his room and
try stealing the case if garland dis-
covers us it means death for us all of
course but on the other hand only that
single tube of red liquid will ever bring
us back to normal stature are you go-
ing to try it with us

  russell drew a long breath his brain
seemed spinning im with you of
course he said at last youre going
to try it-now

  now wallace affirmed weve
got to make the attempt before garland
wakes and it will take us some time to
get from here over into the bungalow
and up inside his rooms wall

  they all stood up wallace gave
quick orders to the others and they be-
gan crawling out of the cavity into the
corridor or rat-tunnel outside wallace
handed to russell one of the heavy spears
with its nail head

  these wouldnt do us any good
against garland god knows he said

but they help us against the rats and
others

  we go through the rat-tunnels to the
bungalow russell asked but the other
shook his head

  no just through them to the surface
and then over to the bungalow and into
its own tunnels there is a perfect war-
ren of them beneath these two buildings

they crawled out after the others
and stood in the rat-tunnel with
lowerman and hall carrying candles
whose flickering light feebly illuminated
the earth-walled corridor at once and
without words they set forth along it but
in an opposite direction from that by
which russell had come to russell it
all was dream-like by then-the flicker-
ing-lit low earth-tunnel they followed
their little band of rough-garbed spear-
armed men the desperate venture that
took them forward

  the tunnel wound this way and that
lowerman led with one candle and hall
brought up the rear with the other once
snelling jabbed forth his spear to pin
to the earth floor a great thing that had
been scuttling sidewise a dark many-
legged shape that seemed of octopus size
to russell and that he only recognized
after a moment as a big spider once
too as they crossed another tunnel there
writhed in front of them a thick long
snake-like thing that they passed unheed-
ingly-a great earthworm

  the tunnel curved upward and the
going became harder its roof still so low
as to keep them stooping in it in mo-
ments there came to russell over the
fumes of damp earth a breath of cleaner
air he glimpsed a round starlit open-
ing ahead and above

  they were within a few yards of it
seemingly when it was blocked by a dark
pigmy island



shape rushing in from outside with-
out a word snelling and wallace and
lowerman had rushed forward with ready
spears there was a grunt and click of
jaws a threshing that dwindled sudden-
ly and before the dazed russell could
more than realize that another huge rat
had rushed into the corridor from out-
side the three were beckoning them on
panting and with their spears bloody
russell followed them sickly over the big
still furry body

  the candles were extinguished and
they came out into open air russell
found that they were standing in grass
whose great blades towered above their
heads all around them he made out
the dark looming expanse of a gigantic
wall behind them realized that it was
the side of the laboratory building up
from beneath which they had come
ahead just visible above the grass-tops
loomed another wall

  they had halted and wallace point-
ed toward it the bungalow he
whispered to russell go quiet now
russell--

  they started forward through the
grass it was like forcing through a
thicket of huge vegetation as they strug-
gled onward through the towering blades
the wall of the bungalow loomed slowly
closer as they went on

  they halted once as a giant winged
thing that seemed of airplane size went
by just above them with a whir of wings
a bat or bird of some kind russell
knew he caught himself glancing at the
stars as they fought on through the grass
wondering if ever before they had looked
down on such a scene as this of their
pigmy band and its progress

  there came suddenly from johnson
at the side of their little band a low

tense whisper and he pointed to the
right with his unbandaged arm they
all froze motionless silent

  russell heart pounding saw that to
the right and ahead the towering grass
blades were stirred by a nearing commo-
tion parting this way and that there
was a dry slithering sound coming near-
er then he saw what it was that ap-
proached a snake a huge snake that
was to their eyes more than a score of
feet in length between one and two feet
in thickness it was gliding through the
great grass slantwise across their path

  the starlight showed clear to russell
as it neared the enormous flexing and un-
flexing length of the snaky body the tri-
angular head and great jewel-like eyes
he strove to tell himself that the thing
was but an ordinary snake made mon-
strous to them by their own pigmy size
he could only watch it with the others
as it glided nearer it did not see
them but glided past and vanished in
the tall grass behind them russell was
not aware of what horror was shaking
him until he felt wallaces steadying
hand on his shoulder he stumbled on
with the others

  the great dark wall of the bungalow
was closer and as they went on through
the great grass they changed their course
heading toward one of the buildings cor-
ners beneath a thicket of shrubs near
that corner they halted a burrow-like
opening in the earth yawned blackly be-
neath them

  already snelling and lowerman were
dropping into it russell followed with
wallace heard the other two coming
after them they were in darkness until
a match flared and spluttered to reveal
another rat-runway like those beneath
the laboratory the candles were lit and


weird tales

they started along it to russell his
brain already dazed the earth walls
around them made it seem that their
minutes of progress through the towering
grasses in the open air was but a dream-
like interlude

  the tunnel twisted upward they
came to a great solid wood barrier over
their heads a round hole gnawed
through it when they had pulled them-
selves up through it they stood in the
interior of a wall a narrow and towering-
walled corridor like that other laboratory
wall whose interior russell had come
through the little band went along this
and then after a few moments turned
into another narrow wall-corridor open-
ing at right angles from the one they
followed they clambered over obstruc-
tions until they came to a place where
wood and plaster alike had been hacked
out and a tiny hole pierced through the
thin surface of plaster remaining on the
walls other side at once the candles
were extinguished

  wallace drew their heads close this
is garlands room he whispered
weve worked for days to dig through
this wall russell dont make a sound
now until we have a look

  he turned back to the tiny opening in
the plaster and peered through it he
motioned then to russell

   hes asleep all right he whispered
and the case-look

  russell peered through the opening
he saw a room like that which he had
occupied in the bungalow on the preced-
ing night-centuries before it seemed-
dimly lit by the thin starlight from the
window with a few chests and articles of
furniture and a simple cot on the cot
stretched an unmoving figure breathing
regularly in sleep - the figure of gar-

land gigantic to his eyes and on a low
table beside the cot-his heart bounded
-the black case that held the two com-
pounds

  well try it now wallace whispered
if we can steal that case and get away
before he wakes-

  enlarge the opening now snelling
asked his spear poised

  wallace nodded but quietly for
gods sake

snelling and hall began to digsilent-
ly at the plaster around the opening
chipping it away with their heavy spears
it seemed iron-hard but bit by bit they
broke loose little fragments of it en-
larging the opening once a fragment
fell outside and rattled on the rooms
floor a foot or two beneath the opening
they all were silent and unmoving but
the regular loud breathing of garland
continued

  at last they had chipped away an op-
ening large enough to permit their pas-
sage through it snelling went first
sliding down to the floor with spear in
hand and catching and steadying the oth-
ers as they too descended johnson was
last half falling they stood upon the
floor a group of six pigmy figures but a
third the height of the great wooden
chest that loomed beside them

  they started silently across the room
toward the low bedside table russell
his breathing strangely tight found him-
self carrying his spear poised his eyes
on the sleeping huge figure on the cot
the absurdity of it came home to him-
the thought that with the tiny ten-inch
spear he could kill that enormous figure
but they were almost beneath the low
table now-his heart drumming with ex-
citement-the eyes of the others brilliant
pigmy island



with hope-the table-the case-the
case-

  a cry from snelling and they leapt
back but too late the huge motionless
form of garland on the cot had sprung
into sudden activity had leapt to the
wall and with a single shove of his giant
arm had pushed the great chest against
the wall covering the hole by which they
had entered blocking their retreat gar-
lands hand found theswitch and far
overhead in the ceiling flared the sun-
like lamps flooding the room with light
and garland a forty-foot giant to their
eyes confronted the six pigmy figures
fully dressed a gleaming pistol in his
hand

  his laugh rumbled down to them like
thunder so you came at last he
jeered wallace-lowerman-all of
you-and even you too russell escaped
i see i knew you would come-sooner
or later

  you thought your burrowing through
the wall quite unobserved eh you dolts
you might have known that i was quite
aware of it and only let you go on be-
cause i knew that you would be coming
in here to steal the compounds and that
i need only wait to trap you here

  and trapped you are-trapped like
rats to die the death of rats do you re-
member how we used to shoot at the rats
with our pistols when we first came here
well the next few minutes ought to be
just as amusing with you six taking the
place of the rats i can get other arid
more tractable subjects for my experi-
ments i think and as for you six you

can now- his arm came up with

the pistol

  wallace cried to the others as their
six pigmy figures sprang back beneath
the tables shadow snelling-hall-

get to his ankles-try to trip him-our
only chance-

  snelling and hall sprang beneath the
shadow of the immense cot just as there
came a terrific detonation across the great
room and a smashing and splintering of
the floor beside them as the great bullet
crashed into it the gigantic garland
laughing in crazy amusement and not no-
ticing the running two figures beneath the
cot sent another bullet into the floor in
front of them as they leapt to escape the
first russell saw johnson trip as they
recoiled again beneath the table and
dragged him with him an instant before
another great bullet dug the floor at that
spot

  the scene was fantastic out of night-
mare the vast room the colossal shape
of garland with pistol in hand the mas-
sive leaden missiles that crashed at them
they made for the shelter of the cot but
threw themselves back only in time to es-
cape another bullet which sent clouds of
great splinters over them lowerman
struck by a flying splinter was knocked
flat and russell saw garlands giant arm
train the pistol on him but he saw too
the foot-high figures of snelling and
hall racing out from the shadow beside
garland to stab furiously at his ankles
with their spears garland stumbled his
fifth shot going wild he started to whirl
around to stamp upon the two pigmy fig-
ures beneath him but they had gripped
his ankles and he tripped fell his body
across the room with head near the other
four pigmy men pistol flying from his
grasp as he struck the floor

  instantly the four foot-high men were
upon him clambering toward his throac
with spears fiercely outthrust the bat-
tle of gulliver and the lilliputians re-
enacted it flashed through russells brain


weird tales

as he drove forward with his spear but
garland a vast bellow of rage coming
from him was scrambling up his flailing
enormous arms knocking them this way
and that russell felt himself whirling
across the floor as a flailing arm struck
him saw garland rising to his feet his
face crimson with rage and garland
his crazy amusement dissolved into mad
fury now was grasping a chair whirling
it over his head to send it crashing down
on the scattered pigmy figures

  russell staggering to his feet even as
garlands chair swung up felt rather
than saw beside him a big metal shape
the pistol that had slid from garlands
hand as the giant fell to the foot-high
russell the pistol was huge but almost
without conscious exertion he had grasped
and lifted it one arm encircling its great
butt and his other hand on its trigger as
he pointed it up like some clumsy big
rifle toward the giant garlands breast
he was not aware that he had pulled the
trigger until the roar of the weapon
knocked him backward there was si-
lence 

  garland swayed as though in stupid
surprize the huge chair slipping from his
upraised hands and crashing to the floor
-swayed a spreading red stain upon his
breast until he too slumped and crashed
in thunderous fall to the floor

  russell was dazedly aware of voices
and running feet of the others crowding
about him weeping sobbing helping
him up wallace and lowerman were
climbing to the low table bearing down
from it the black case between them the
six pigmy figures crowding round it as
it was opened with frantic haste the
tubes of red and green compound-wal-
lace was filling the big hypodermic nee-

                                                              

die the others supporting tube and needle
as the red compound filled the latter
they crouched down near the rooms cen-
ter but away from the prostrate giant fig-
ure of garland-and then wallace and
the great needle-a stab of pain in rus-
sells neck as it penetrated - and then
swift darkness-darkness-darkness 

when russell awoke sunlight was
warm upon his face he opened his
eyes stirred sat weakly up nausea and
weariness infinite upon him around
him others were stirring he looked
about him dazedly then with swift re-
membrance and comprehension wal-
lace and lowerman and snelling john-
son and hall they all were stirring wak-
ing like himself in the crowded room
that seemed now not gigantic but small
and beside them another figure that did
not stir-garland garland-his dead
figure no larger in size than their own

  they staggered to their feet dazed
all by the transition from pigmy to
human stature once more they were all
without clothing and on the floor lay
the little rough tunics that had been theirs
as pigmies and the absurdly little spears
they groped out of the room after un-
locking the door and groped into cloth-
ing in the other rooms like men restored
suddenly from insanity to sanity they
poured stumbling out of the bungalow
into the light of still another sunset their
speech still incoherent

  the boat said wallace thickly
lets get away-for gods sake lets get
away he halted suddenly but

first-

he ran back into the bungalow and
when he emerged disappeared into the
laboratory then joined them as they
continued on page 
the annual midsummer ladies
night at the kobbskill country
club proved a pretty part the
white walls of the clubhouse reared in
the severe style of architecture affected by
the early dutch settlers shone like an
illuminated monument in the dusky blue
of the july night lights blazed at every
window and colored bulbs decorated the
overhanging roofs of the broad piazzas
which stretched along the front and rear
w t-

of the building the artistically parked
grounds near the house shone with
chinese lanterns which gleamed with
rose blue violet gold and jade rival-
ing the brilliance of the summer stars
jazz blared in the commodious ballroom
and echoed from the big yellow-and-red-
striped marquee set up by the first green
brilliant as the plumage of birds of para-
dise the light silken dresses of the women
made bright highlights in the night

                                      


weird tales

while the somber black and white of
their escorts costumes furnished a pleas-
ing contrast and made the chiaroscuro of
color the more vivid three of us-jules
de grandin our host colonel patrick
fitzpatrick and i-sat on the front veran-
da and rocked comfortably in wide wicker
chairs the ice in our tall glasses tinkling
pleasantly

   mordieu mes amis the little french-
man exclaimed enthusiastically sucking
appreciatively from the twin straws in his
long glasscest une scene tres charmante
it is so-how do you say-so-ah mort
de ma vie les belles creatures his gaze
rested on a pair of girls who paused mo-
mentarily beneath the luminous drops of
the crystal chandelier hanging from the
porch roof at the head of the stairs

   limned in vivid silhouette against the
background of smalt-blue sky and black-
green evergreens the girls were oddly
alike yet curiously unlike both were
gowned in green tall and slender with
the modernly fleshless figure which simu-
lates boyishness more than femininity
both had small clear-carved features
both wore their hair cut close at the back
rather long and prettily waved at the
front both possessed complexions of
milky whiteness but one was yellow-
haired and violet-eyed while the short-
shorn locks of the other were red as rose-
gold alloyed with copper and her eyes
long black-fringed and obliquing slight-
ly downward at their outer corners were
green as moss-agate

  parbleu the frenchman swore de-
lightedly they are like a boutonniere-
she of the golden hair is like an asphodele
-a slender daffodil that sways and dances
in the evening breeze while she of the
ruddy tresses m or bleu she is a poppy

a glorious glowing-red poppy to steal
mens senses away no less

  humph colonel fitzpatrick re-
turned youre nearer right than you
think old-timer shes all of that and
then some

  ah you know her de grandin
asked with interest

  ought to fitzpatrick laughed the
yellow-haired ones my daughter joseph-
ine the others my niece dolores shes
lived with us since she was a kid of ten
and a queer lot she is too

  but certainly the frenchman agreed
with a vigorous nod one with hair and-
eyes like hers could be no ordinary mortal
she is a fee a pixy out of some story-
book a-

  im not so sure of that the other
interrupted with a chuckle sometimes
ive thought her an imp out of quite a
different place shes been off to school-
so has josephine-for the past two years
but unless shes changed a lot some ones
in for a bad time before she goes back
he paused a moment drawing thought-
fully at his cigar then they say cleo-
patra and helen of troy not to mention
helen of tyre had hair of that odd
metallic red im inclined to credit the
legends dolores is the sort whod go to
any lengths for a thrill i can imagine
her on the throne of an eastern despot
administering poison to her unsuspecting
lovers just to see em squirm as they died
and having a few dozen assorted captives
disemboweled to find out what made em
tick pity or even decent consideration
for others feelings just dont exist when
her curiosity or convenience are con-
cerned

  the girls seemed engaged in some sort
of argument the red-haired one striving
to interest the blond in some plan the
daughter of the moonlight



yellow-haired girl stubbornly refusing at
length with a shrug betraying mingled
annoyance and resignation the blond
girl gave in and they passed toward the
dancing marquee arm in arm

  there you are fitzpatrick grumbled
never knew it to fail josephines got
plenty of will of her own where im con-
cerned-where any one else is for that
matter-but dolores can twist her round
her finger any time she wishes

  we rocked smoked and cooled our-
selves with repeated orders from the club
stewards stock played several rubbers of
bridge then returned to the porch for re-
freshments by two oclock the cars
began leaving the parking-lot and by a
quarter of three the house and grounds
were all but deserted

  confound it colonel fitzpatrick
grumbled where the deuce are those
hare-brained girls dont they know id
like to be home by daylight

  interrogation of several homeward-
bound couples failed to elicit information
concerning the girls whereabouts and
our host at last lost his temper lets
go round em up he proposed im
betting well find em lallygagging with a
pair of shiny-haired sheiks in one of those
fool summer-houses

however well the colonel knew his
women-folk his prediction proved
at least half-way wrong before we had
walked a hundred yards from the club-
house from a shaded bower of honey-
suckle ideally adapted for the exchange
of youthful vows of undying affection
the sound of a woman sobbing piteously
attracted our attention as we approached
the green gown and crocus-yellow hair of
joisephine fitzpatrick told us half our
quest was over

  why jo whats the matter colonel
fitzpatrick asked as he paused beside his
daughter his assumed bruskness evap-
orated as he saw her abject misery and
real concern was in his voice as he con-
tinued here all alone wheres mar-
tin i thought i saw him here tonight
he was-he is-oh i dont know
where he is the girl returned with the
inconsistency of overmastering grief
hes somewhere with dolores and-oh

i wish i were dead

  there daughter there fitzpatrick
patted the girls gleaming bare shoulder
with awkward tenderness tell dad
about it it cant be so very bad why
only last week martin asked me for you

and-

  thats just it the girl interrupted
with a high half-hysterical wail dolores
knew he wanted me and i wanted him-
she didnt want him really she just
wanted to take him from me to show
she could do it its always been so
daddy when we were little girls she
always took the doll i loved the most and
broke it when she tired of it she beat me
for honors at school when she heard i
was out for the history prize i never had
a beau she didnt take away from me
now shes taken martin and-oh dad

i never wanted anything in all my life as
i want him make her give him back
shell take him as she took my dolls and
-and shell break him when she tires
of him too shell never never give himi
back to me oh i hate her i hate herp
now jo- her father began awk-
wardly but

  i know what youre going to say i
she blazed youre going to tell mej j
shes an orphan hasnt any one to iovei 
or care for her but us and i must give ini
to her-give her everything i prize most


weird tales

bccausc her father and mother are dead j
she got away with everything i wanted j
most on those grounds when we were
children but she shant have martin i
tell you she shant i love him and i
want him and i wont let her have him
ill kill her first

   go get your things fitzpatrick inter-
rupted authoritatively ill bring dolores
in-and martin too he turned away
with a stern set face and tramped pur-
posefully toward the deeper shadow of
the evergreen grove

  everything she says is true he con-
fided as we marched along dolores
came to us when her parents were killed
in a railway accident in virginia she
was only ten then and was the sole sur-
vivor of the wreck her father was my
younger brother her mother-humph
well none of us knew much of her jim
met her down south somewhere while he
was heading a surveying crew wrote us
all sorts of glowing letters about her but
i never met her-dad absolutely forbade
the match you see and when they were
married in spite of him refused to see
either of them jim got it in his head i
was opposed to it too so when father
died and cut him out of his will hed
have nothing to do with me wouldnt
even answer my letters when i wrote and
offered to share the estate half and half
with him then he and giatanas were
killed and i took dolores to live with us
shes co-legatee in my will with joseph-
ine and ive tried to be a father to her
but-well there have been times when i
thought id underwritten too big an
issue

  giatanas de grandin repeated
softly an odd name for an american
woman is it not monsieur what was
her surname if you recall

  she didnt have any as far as i
know fitzpatrick returned thats
where the difficulties arose she wasnt
an american she was a spanish gipsy
the seventh daughter of the queen of the
tribe who claimed to be a seeress and all
that sort of tosh jim met her when his
crew came on their camp and simply
went blotto over her at first glance i
dont know much about the gipsies but
ive been told theyre not christians at
any rate giatanas and he were married
by the tribal rite not by a clergyman and
i suppose their marriage wasnt absolute-
ly legal but-

  a crashing as of some heavy-focfted
animal sounded in the undergrowth of
a near-by pine copse

  who-what the devils that colo-
nel fitzpatrick demanded striding bel-
ligerently toward the disturbance come
out o that whoever you are or ill come
in after you now then come on-good
god look

                                                              f

   parting the long-needled branches with
blind groping hands a young man in
evening dress stumbled and staggered
into the pool of luminance shed by a
chinese lantern his collar and tie were
undone his shirt broken loose from its
studs his clothing in utter disarray blood
streamed over his chin in a steady spate
staining his linen and dripping on the
pine needles at his feet at first i thought
his lips parted in a drunken grin but as
he reeled nearer i gave an exclamation of
horror the grimace i had thought
voluntary resulted from dreadful mutila-
tion where the scarf-skin and mucous
membrane joined his lips had been cut
away in two semicircular sections like a
pair of parentheses laid horizontally re-
vealing the white staring teeth beneath
daughter of the moonlight



and drenching his chin and breast with
a spilth of ruby blood

  martin boy whatever is the matter-
how did it happen fitzpatrick asked in
a shrill half-unbelieving whisper

  the young man gave a slavering un-
intelligible answer waving his arms
wildly toward the clearing behind as his
mutilated lips refused to form the words
and goggling at us with rolling horrified
eyes his impotence and fright his in-
ability to speak and the wondering horror
in his dazed eyes sickened me it was
like witnessing the agony of some gentle
dumb animal tortured where it had
thought to find kindness

  quick friend trowbridge de gran-
din cried as he snatched the handkerchief
from his breast pocket and deftly folded
it into a pack for the boys maimed
mouth help me get him to the house
we must take immediate measures for his
coronary vessels are cut-his hemorrhage
is dangerous let monsieur fitzpatrick
seek his niece here is work for us

while we clawed through the meager
supplies of the clubs first-aid kit
an attendant telephoned harrisonville for
an ambulance and reported that the big
emergency car which coroner martin in
his private capacity of funeral director
kept available for service was already on
its way for the city hospitals resolutely
refused to send their cars beyond the
limits of the municipality

  dieu de dieu the frenchman swore
feverishly if we could but obtain a styp-
tic we might make progress but this
gauze this adhesive tape these prepared
bandages-what use are they on the
field of battle yes in such a case as this
where we must ever consider the coming
operation which is to restore the young

monsieurs countenance non ah parbleu
i have it quick friend trowbridge
rush run hasten fly to the so excellent
chef and obtain from him some gelatin
and a pan of boiling-hot water yes
that will do most nobly i apprehend

  working quickly he made a paste of
the gelatin and water then applied the
transparent mixture to young fabers torn
lips to my surprize it acted almost as
well as collodion and in a few minutes
the entire flow of blood was staunched
we had hardly finished when martins
ambulance drew up before the door its
powerful eight-cylinder engine panting
like a live thing with the strain to which
it had been put in making the ten-mile
run assisted by the genial mortician
who had dropped his other work to super-
intend the emergency trip we bundled
the injured man into a chair-cot and bore
him to the car

  mon dieu my hat de grandin
wailed as i was about to leap into the
ambulance and slam the door quick
my friend get it for me if you please-it
cost me fifty francs

  i hustled to the check room to retrieve
the missing headgear and as i hurried
out again i caught a glimpse of josephine
and dolores fitzpatrick awaiting the
colonel and his car

  josephine tear-scarred and tremulous
had evidently been upbraiding her
cousin in no uncertain terms but the red-
haired maiden was calm beneath the re-
proaches

  martin i heard her exclaim in a
cool ironical voice why jo dear i
dont want him youre welcome to him
im sure

  something like a draft of winter air
piercing through the sultry summer night
seemed to chill my spine as i listened


weird tales

was it just a crack-brained fancy that
made me think her thin red lips were
colored with a smear less innocent than
any brand of rouge obtainable at drug
stores

the carelessness of a local fish-dealer
in failing to provide adequate re-
frigeration for his finny stock occasioned
a young epidemic of mild ptomaine poi-
sonings and i was kept busy prescribing
rochelle salt and administering hypo-
dermic doses of morphine throughout the
following day by dinnertime i was in a
state bordering on collapse but jules de
grandin was fresh as the newly starched
linen he had donned for the evening
meal

  what have you been up to i asked
as we enjoyed our coffee on the side
veranda

  eh bien three stories no less he
answered with a chuckle

  what

   three stories i did say he returned
upon the third floor of mercy hospital
with the young monsieur faber jules de
grandin is clever the wounds upon the
young monsieurs face already make ex-
cellent progress there is no infection and
all is prepared for me to graft flesh from
his leg upon his mangled lips when i
have done only a little so small mustache
will be needed to hide his scars from the
world yes it is an altogether satisfactory
case

   how the deuce did he receive that ap-
palling hurt i wondered it looked
almost as though some ferocious beast
had worried him but thats absurd of
course there isnt any game more sav-
age than a rabbit to be found in this sec-
tion of jersey

  um de grandin sipped a mouthful
of coffee slowly and beat a devils tattoo

on the arm of his chair with small slen-
der fingers one wonders

  this one doesnt-not tonight at any
rate i answered im too tired to think
its been a hard day and tomorrow looks
like another ill turn in if you dont
mind

  happy dreams he bade with a wave
of his hand as i rose to go inside

perhaps it was the salad i had eaten
perhaps the broiling heat of the july
night which made me so thirsty at any
rate i woke with parched tongue and
paper-dry lips some time between mid-
night and dawn and reached sleepily for
the carafe of chilled water on my bed-
side table i upturned the chromium-
plated bottle but no cooling trickle of
liquid reached my glass hang it i
muttered as i sought my slippers and
started for the bathroom to replenish the
exhausted water supply

  fdieu non i shall make no treaty with
such as you i heard de grandin whisper
as i shuffled past his door on my return
trip away hell-spawn i enter no en-
gagements-

  i paused before his door wondering
whether it were better to waken him or
let his nightmare pass when a further
sound came from beyond the panels-a
queer baffling sound like something
scratching and clawing at the stout cop-
per screen at the window i hesitated no
longer

  good lord i exclaimed as i entered
the bedroom jules de grandin lay on his
bed his limbs taut and rigid his fingers
clutching at the linen beyond the screen
clawing at the copper mesh with the fury
of a savage beast was the biggest owl i
had ever seen with beak and talon it
fought the woven wire and in its glow-
daughter of the moonlight



ing yellow eyes there blazed a steady j
glare of concentrated malignancy and
hatred

  a moment i stared at the uncanny
thing completely taken aback then act-
ing without conscious thought i hurried
to the window and dashed the contents
of my water-bottle full in its evil face
be off i ordered sharply the vis-
itants fiery eyes disappeared as though
they had been two glowing coals ex-
tinguished by the flood of water and
with a scream of mingled rage and fright
it flapped away in the surrounding
shadows

  fcordieu de grandin woke with a
start and sat bolt-upright i have had a
most exceedingly evil dream friend
trowbridge i dreamed a mighty owl
well-nigh as great as uncle sams so
glorious eagle came clawing at the win-
dow and bade me keep darkly secret a
fact i discovered today i refused its
order and it made at me with beak and
claws as if it were a devil-bird from
hells own subcellar

  hm the devil part of it was prob-
ably a dream i answered but the owl
was certainly real enough the biggest
one i ever saw was scratching at the
screen like a thing possessed when i came
down the hall a moment ago t

thought-

  ha do you tell me and where is it
now he interrupted

   drying itself i imagine

 you mean-

   i didnt know what else to do to dis-
courage it so i flung a quart or so of
water on it

  oh trowbridge my good my in-
comparable trowbridge he applauded
you know not what you do but always

you do the right thing did you also
address it

  yes i grinned sheepishly i said
be off 

  mort dun rat mort he cried leaping
from the bed and flinging both arms
about me you are priceless my old
i one you are perfections own self no
less

  what the deuce-

  you did perfectly if it were a phys-
ical natural bird which i greatly doubt
the dousing you gave it was enough to
discourage its ardor beyond dispute if it
were what i damnation suspect the bap-
tism and your unequivocal command to
i take itself elsewhere were precisely what
was required to rid us of its presence
oh mv inestimable one if i could be as
j 
sure of myself in my wisdom as you are
in your ignorance i should esteem jules
de grandin more highly

  thank heaven you arent then i
countered with a laugh youre bad
enough as it is if you admired yourself
any more thered be no living with you
bete he cried i have killed for
less than that the least i should do is

challenge you to mortal combat and-

  confound it i interrupted and at
this unholy hour too my bedroom
telephone had commenced ringing with
all the infernal insistence of which those
instruments of torture are capable when
we are blissfully asleep

  hullo dr trowbridge came the
challenge over the wire fitzpatrick
speaking can you come over at once
its dolores-shes gone

  gone i echoed why how do you

mean have you notified the police-

  hells fire no this is a case for a
physician she had some sort of seizure
this afternoon and-


weird tales

  all right i broke in well be
right out

  ten minutes later de grandin and i
were speeding toward seven pines fitz-
patricks palatial country seat

the place was in a turmoil when we
reached it lights blazed in the win-
dows from top to bottom the colonel his
daughter and the servants trod on each
others heels in aimless circling quests for
the missing girl everywhere was bustle
confusion and futility

  hanged if i know what it was the
colonel confessed as we shook hands
dolores had been acting queerly ever
since last night when young faber was
injured by the way how is he doctor de
grandin

   excellent all things considered the
frenchman replied but it is of made-
moiselle dolores we were speaking
what of her

  well after we found martin faber
last night i beat my way through the
pines to look for her and found her
stretched out on the ground unconscious
it gave me a shock-i thought she might
be dead or injured but just as i stooped
to pick her up she came round rose with-
out assistance and walked to the house
with me as coolly as though falling in a
faint was an every-night occurrence with
her

   tens and was it de grandin asked

  not that i know fitzpatrick an-
swered shortly i asked her if shed seen
martin and she said she had

    was he all right i wanted to know
and

    as right as usual-hes always some-
thing of an ass isnt he uncle pat she
answered

    perhaps youd be interested if i told

you hes been terribly hurt had both lips
almost torn off i snapped

   perhaps i should but im not she
replied as cool as you please and thats
all i got from her

   youre inhuman i accused

   so ive been told she admitted

  after that we didnt speak till we
reached the clubhouse

  i think she and josephine had a
pretty warm set-to later for both of em
seemed rather huffy when we drove home
and dolores began acting queerly this
morning

  how by example de grandin
asked

  oh she seemed unduly depressed
even for one of her moody temperament
wouldnt eat anything and seemed not to
hear when any one spoke to her just
before dinner she was sitting on the
porch looking down the lawn but not
seeming to see anything when all of a
sudden i noticed her left foot was twitch-
ing and shaking like- he paused

for an adequate illustration then as
though a galvanic current had been ap-
plied to it

  i looked at her wondering what the
matter was and within a moment the
spasm seemed to spread all over her
shed shake as though with a chill then
seem to relax go limp as a damp cloth
then tremble more violently than ever
before i could reach her shed slipped
from her chair to the floor and lay there
twitching and trembling like a mechanical
figure when the clockwork is almost run
down her eyes were partly opened but
the eyeballs were turned up under the
upper lids so the pupils were invisible
she seemed wholly unconscious when i
picked her up	
daughter of the moonlight



  great heavens i exclaimed that

has all the earmarks of an epilep-

  zut de grandin cut me short
what happened further if you please
monsieur

  thats all we put her to bed and
she seemed to lapse into a natural sleep
i hadnt planned on calling you until to-
morrow morning but a few minutes ago
when josephine went in to see how she
was we found shed gone weve
searched everywhere but she seems to
have evaporated if wed only thought to
have somebody stay with her we

might-

  pardon me sir fitzpatricks chauf-
feur suggested pausing respectfully by his
employers elbow ive been thinking
bruno might be able to help us here hes
a hunter and his scent is keen even if he
hasnt been trained to track people

  nonsense- the colonel began

but

  excellent my old one your idea is
entirely sound de grandin applauded
obtain from mademoiselles wardrobe a
pair of shoes and let the dog smell them
thoroughly then by happy chance if
the others have not already obscured her
tracks with their fruitless searchings we
may be led to her

the dog a long-legged rangy hound
was brought from the stable given
the scent from a pair of dolores bedroom
mules and led out by the chauffeur
slowly the man and beast walked round
the house in ever-widening circles the
hounds nose was to the ground most of
the time but every now and then he
would raise his muzzle and sniff the
upper air as though to clear his nostrils of
a confusing medley of scents they had
almost completed their twelfth circuit

when the dog abruptly jerked forward
against his leash thrust his muzzle for-
ward and gave a deep belling bay next
instant dragging himself free he set out
toward a rise of ground behind fitzpat-
ricks grove his gray-and-brown body
extended shoulders and hind-quarters
moving rhythmically as he galloped

  after him friend trowbridge de
grandin cried he has the scent he
will assuredly take us to her

  stumbling scrambling over the un-
even ground of the wood we followed
the dog entered the deeper shadow of the
grove then paused irresolute for all trace
of our canine guide had vanished

  sucre bleu de grandin swore we
are at fault here mon brave here noble
animal he put his fingers to his lips
and sounded a shrill whistle

  answer was almost immediate from
the farther side of the wood the hound
came slinking his ears and muzzle droop-
ing tail tucked pitifully between his legs
like a frightened child the beast cowered
by de grandins legs and whimpered in
abject terror

  huh exclaimed the chauffeur th
fool dawgs lost th scent

  the little frenchman slipped his finger
under the animals collar and advanced
slowly toward the clearing beyond
what lies yonder he asked turning to
the chauffeur

  th ol graveyard returned the
other colonel fitzpatrick tried to buy
it when he took over th estate but th
heirs wouldnt sell our land stops at th
boundary o th woods sir

  eh do you tell me de grandin ans-
wered absently patting the whimpering
hounds back gently it may well be our
good beast has found the trail only too
well and returned to us for reasons of


weird tales

prudence vion ami look what is that j
he pointed upward

  clear-cut against the faint luminosity
of the summer sky a great black-winged
bird went sailing on outstretched almost
motionless pinions circled slowly a mo-
ment then swooped downward to the
fenced-in close of the old dismantled
burying-ground which lay before us
almost at once another spectral shape
and still another followed the first in
ghostly single file

  hm they look like owls to me the
chauffeur returned but theyre bigger
than any owls i ever seen jimminy
crickets theres three of em never seen
nothin like it before

  let us hope you may not do so again
the little frenchman answered come
let us go

  not quittin are yuh the chauffeur
asked half contemptuously

  the frenchman made no reply as the
hounds collar still clutched in his hand
he strode toward the house

  once inside the lighted hall he swept
the circle of servants with an appraising
eye is there a catholic present he
demanded

  sure im one volunteered die cook
on whose countenance appeared the map
of county kerry wot ov it

  very good will you be good enough
to lend me your rosary and a flask of
holy water as well if you happen to
possess it he returned

  sure ye can have em an welcome
she answered but what yere afther
wantin ov em is moren i can see

  two steps carried de grandin to her
side what is today madame he
asked staring her levelly in the eye

  why sure an its july thirty-first-

i no tis august first she answered won-
 deringly

  precisement in france we call this
day la fete de saint pierre-es-liens you
know it as the feast of saint peters

chains or-

  glory be to god tis lammas she
cried terrified understanding shining in
her face wuz it fer this th pore young
gur-rl wuz stole away

  i would not go so far de grandin
answered but a moment since the hound
came whimpering and trembling to my
knee after he had been to the ancient
graveyard which lies beyond monsieur le
colonels woodland and we did see three
monster owls with yellow sulfurous eyes
fly past the moon may i have the blessed
articles

  indade ye shall she told him heart-
ily an its th brave lad ye are to ven-
ture in that haunted place faith bridget
oflaherty wouldnt do it if th howly
father stood at her elbow wid th whole
college o cardinals behint im ouch
god an th howly saints preserve this
house tonight she signed herself rever-
ently with the cross as she hastened to
procure the rosary and blessed water

once more we forced our way through
fitzpatricks wood lot wrapped
about his right wrist de grandin wore the
cooks rosary like a bracelet in his left
hand he bore a half-pint flask adorned
with a label assuring the beholder that it
contained golden wedding rye 
years old bottled in bond but which
actually contained nothing more lawless
than water from the font of st josephs
church at the frenchmans heels i
marched a double-barreled shotgun
cocked and ready that we might be pre-
daughter of the moonlight



pared to meet the foe on ghostly or ter-
restrial planes

  careful friend trowbridge he
warned we do approach stepping
cautiously from the shadow of the oak
trees he advanced stealthily toward the
tumbledown wooden fence enclosing the
disused cemetery

  almost as we emerged from the wood
there came a queer high piping sound
a sort of sustained whistle so shrill as to
be almost inaudible yet so piercing in
quality that it stabbed the ear as a den-
tists whirling drill bites the tortured
tooth up wheeling blindly in ever-
widening circles then pouncing forward
like birds of prey came a trio of great
sable bats squeaking viciously as they
swooped at our faces

  ha evil ones you find us not unpre-
pared the little frenchman whispered
between drawn lips behold this sign ye
minions of the dark-look and be
afraid he raised his bead-bound wrist
displaying the miniature crucifix which
swung from the rosary and at the same
time thrust his left hand forward send-
ing a shower of holy water toward the
flying things

  the bats were larger than any creatures
of the kind i had ever seen in my excite-
ment it seemed to me they were as big as
full-grown rats with wing-spread of a
yard or more and their little evil eyes
glinted with a red and fiery malevolence
as they swooped i raised the gun and
loosed both barrels at them then broke
the lock and jammed fresh cartridges
feverishly into the smoking breech

  hola de grandin cried exultingly
you or i or both of us have put them to
rout friend trowbridge see they are
gone

  they were look as i would i could
espy no sign of the uncouth things

  why i must have literally blown
them to pieces i exclaimed

  um perhaps he conceded let us
see what further we may see

  dolores fitzpatrick lay supine upon a
sunken grave her head pressed tight
against the weather-gnawed tombstone
her feet toward the lower end of the
sepulcher stretched to utmost length
diagonally from her shoulders her arms
extended up and outward while her
nether limbs were thrust out stiffly at
acute angles from her hips making the
design of a white st andrews cross upon
the mossy graveyard turf briars and
clutching undergrowth had ripped her
flimsy silken nightrobe to tatters so that
scarce a shred remained to clothe her
her slippers had been shed somewhere in
her flight and stones and brambles had
bruised and torn her tender feet more
than one thorn-gash scarred her slim
white body and a wisp of short ruddy
hair lay across her forehead like a bleed-
ing wound

  good heavens i cried dropping to
my knees and taking her wrist between
my fingers shes-i paused put my
ear to her still breast then looked up at
the frenchman with dawning horror in
my eyes-shes gone de grandin were
too late the poor child must have
wandered here in her delirium and fallen
on this grave in a fresh seizure see her
thumbs

  there was no mistaking the diagnostic
sign her thumbs were bent transversely
across her palms and the fingers clutched
them with all the avid tensity of rigor
mortis

  epilepsy no doubt of it i diagnosed
the history of her case as detailed by


weird tales

fitzpatfick is absolutely unmistakable
the poor girls lived beneath this shadow
for years without suspecting it-that was
the reason for her queerness and per-
versity that made her hardly tolerable
she was at the dangerous age and when
the blow fell it crushed her absolutely
the frenchman knelt beside her felt
her wrist and temples and listened at her
breast then rose with what seemed to me
a strangely callous indifference give me
the gun he ordered as he shed his
jacket and draped it over dolores all but
nude remains do you take her up and
bear her to the house my friend

  have you read your bible much of
late he asked apropos of nothing as i
crudged in his wake with the lovely body
in my arms

  my bible

  precisement that portion which deals
with those possessed of devils

  no-why dye ask

  i hardly know myself he answered
almost absently holding back a branch
from my path it was but a thought
which came to me perhaps it is of little
value perhaps again it may have appli-
cation here if so i shall explain when
the time has come

the first faint sign came as i strode
up the graveled walk toward fitz-
patricks house just as i was about to
mount the lower step of the veranda i
felt a slight stirring the faintest sugges-
tion of fluttering motion in my burden i
cook the short flight in two giant leaps
and bent to examine her countenance in
the porch lights glare there was no
doubt about it she had relaxed her
clutching hold upon her thumbs and her
lower jaw which had fallen had once
more raised itself closing the mouth and

giving to the thin pale face a look of
natural sleep even as i gazed incredu-
lously into her countenance her bosom
trembled and a faint sigh escaped her

  de grandin i cried de grandin
shes alive

  he nodded shortly i thought as
much he said then his manner as
professionally impersonal as though he
were visiting physician at a charity hos-
pital see that the blankets on her bed
are well warmed and that no disturbing
noises are permitted near her room i
would suggest we administer the brown-
sequard prescription it is often effica-
cious

however much it lacked in sympathy
his advice was medically sound
within a week dolores fitzpatrick ap-
peared quite normal in ten days more
against my protests she had renewed her
febrile social life driving at breakneck
speed along the country roads attending
all-night dances scattering a trail of badly
damaged masculine hearts behind her
and worst of all indulging in the villain-
ous poison which passed for whisky
among the younger set

  the frenchmans lack of interest in
the case amazed me curious as a child
he was ordinarily wont to give my cases
as close attention as though they were his
own and his weakness for a pretty face
was a standing joke between us yet in
dolores fitzpatrick beautiful heartless
and fascinating as circes own seductive
self he seemed to take no interest

  well i announced as i entered the
study one scorching night some three
weeks later perhaps youll be interested
now shes gone she died an hour ago
with cardiac hypertrophy i knew shed
burn herself out
daughter of the moonlight



   for the first time his mask of indiffer-
ence slipped who will have the fu-
neral-monsieur martin he asked

  yes ive already made out die death
certificate for him

  he reached for the phone and called
the coroners number it is a most
strange request i have to make mon-
sieur he confessed when the connection
had been made but you and i have been
associated before you will understand
i do not act from idle curiosity will you
permit that i be present while you em-
balm mademoiselle fitzpatricks body
you may consider it impertinent but-
nom dun chou-fleur do you tell me but
you will not honor it surely dieu de
dieu you will

  what now i asked as he put back
the receiver and turned a blank face to
me

  a so strange testament has been
found in mademoiselle dolores room
he answered in it she does expressly re-
quest that she be not embalmed you at-
tended her my friend you have author-
ity will you not prevail on monsieur
fitzpatrick to have an autopsy per-
formed

  i cant i told him the cause of
death was perfectly obvious ive seen it
coming for days and warned fitzpatrick
of it hed think me crazy

  i shall think you worse if you re-
fuse

  im sorry i returned theres no
earthly excuse for a post-mortem i
wouldnt think of asking one

   and there the matter rested

the last humming echo of the final
gong-stroke spent itself in the still
summer air and like the faintest whisper
of a breeze among half-dried leaves came
the subdued rustle which betokened turn-

ing heads and craning necks-that gesture
which even well-bred people make at
such a time

  a momentary congestion at the church
door while six frock-coated and perspir-
ing gentlemen bent their backs to the un-
accustomed task then

  i am the resurrection and die life
saith the lord he that believeth in me
though he were dead yet shall he
live   

   dr bentleys resonant voice sounded as
he marched slowly up the aisle before the
flower-decked casket i know that my
redeemer liveth and that he shall stand
at the latter day upon the earth   

   the afternoon sun shone softly through
the stained glass windows and glinted on
the polished mahogany of the pews
here and there it picked out spots of
color a flower a womans hat or a mans
tie through a memorial panel to the
right of the chancel a single beam of
tinted light gleamed dully on the silver
mountings of the casket the majestic
office for the burial of the dead proceeded
to benediction the choirs voices rose in
lead kindly light drowning out the
muffled boom of the traffic in the street
beyond

  as the organs final diminuendo vi-
brated to silence the pallbearers rose to
their appointed task and once more the
solemn procession passed through the
center aisle a momentary lull came in
the outside traffic as the suave mortician
appeared on the church steps then a
motor purred to the curb the hearse
moved forward and the procession was
on its way

   jules de grandin tossed his burned-out
cigarette from the window of coroner
martins limousine and gazed in undis-
guised admiration at the mortician you


weird tales

are marvelous no less monsieur he as-
sured him in my own country and any-
where in europe mademoiselle fitz-
patrick would have been consigned to the
grave in four-and-twenty hours we do
not embalm there here under similar
conditions you present her at the church
three hot summer days after death as
though she lay in natural sleep tell me
he leaned forward eagerly is it perhaps
that you ignored the injunctions of her
testament and embalmed her body after
all

  martin shook his head did you
notice the casket he asked

  it was a most beautiful piece of fur-
niture the frenchman answered with
non-committal politeness

  i wasnt referring to its appearance
but to its construction the other re-
turned the outside case is mahogany
carefully glued and jointed practically
a water- and air-tight box inside is a
shell technically known as an inner
sealer a separate copper case with an
hermetically sealed full-length top of
plate glass this in turn is lined with
satin upholstery before we laid the
young lady in this inner casket we put
upward of a hundred briquettes of car-
bon dioxid snow-the dry ice used by
confectioners to keep ice cream hard for
long periods-under the satin trimmings
then we fastened down the glass top and
made it airtight with rubber gaskets and
liquid cement the air space between
the inner and outer caskets and the her-
metic sealing of the inner case insured the
carbon dioxid against rapid evaporation
the result being that the temperature in
the inner casket is and will continue for a
long time to be several degrees below
freezing you see

  perfectly de grandin agreed with a

quick nod you have refrigerated her-
she will remain in her present condition
indefinitely

  well coroner martin smiled depre-
catingly im sure therell be no immedi-
ate change in her condition or- he

broke off abruptly for we had arrived at
the cemetery and he was once more the
busy official directing an undrilled per-
sonnel in the performance of unfamiliar
duties with the precision of a detach-
ment of trained soldiers

  i kept my gaze fixed demurely on the
ground as befitted a physician whose
patient was being buried but jules de
grandin permitted no conventions to
hamper him about the grave he strolled
taking eye-measurements of the location
noting the character of the upturned soil
examining the approaches with the prac-
tised eye of one who had seen much mili-
tary service

  there is a new moon tonight friend
trowbridge he whispered as we re-
entered martins car for the return trip
be so good as to make no engagements
if you please

  a new moon i echoed in amaze-
ment what the dickens are you drool-
ing about what has the new moon to
do with us

  nothing i hope much i fear he re-
turned seriously

  his air of suppressed excitement told
me he had some enterprise on foot but
his irritating habit of keeping his plans to
himself was strong as ever to all my
questions he returned no more informa-
tive answer than a shrug of a lifted eye-
brow at length he turned his shoulder
squarely on me gazed out the window
and fell to humming

          ma file pour penitence

            ron et ron petit patapon

          ma fille pour penitence

nous nous embrasseronsv
daughter of the moonlight



the night air was heavy with dew and
drenched with the perfume of honey-
suckle as de grandin and i let ourselves
through the narrow door flanking the
main entrance of the great canterbury
gate leading to shadow lawns cemetery
michaelson the superintendent was
awaiting us in the office adjoining the
graveyards imposing gothic chapel and
that he expected trouble of some sort
was clearly evidenced by the heavy re-
volver swinging in a shoulder-holster be-
neath his left armpit down hinden-
burg-charge he ordered gruffly as a
monstrous police dog with baleful green
eyes half rose from its station before the
fireless hearth and bared a set of awe-
inspiring teeth

  ive been on the lookout all evening
he told us as we shook hands but noth-
ings happened yet sure you got a
straight tip doctor de grandin

  the frenchman tweaked the carefully
waxed ends of his tiny blond mustache
my informant is one i have every reason
to trust he replied i am not surprized
you have seen nothing thus far but it
might be well if we took our stations now
we know not when something may trans-
pire

  all right michaelson agreed slip-
ping on a dark jacket and snapping a
woven-leather leash through the dogs
collar lets go

  as we walked along the winding well
kept roads beneath the arching trees to-
ward the fitzpatrick family plot mighty
glad you got this information in time
the superintendent said shadow lawns
has been operating more than fifty years
and weve never had a grave robbery not
even in the days when medical schools
had to buy stolen bodies for their work

id hate to have our record broken now
wonder if therell be a gang of em

  i doubt it de grandin answered
indeed i think this will be scarcely
what could be called a grave robbery it
is more apt to be a violation

  hm i dont think i quite follow
you michaelson confessed as we took
up our position in the shadow of an im-
posing bronze-and-granite monument
what makes you so sure it will be to-
night

  the moon-the new moon the
frenchman replied

  the mo- well ill be damned

rejoined the other

our wait seemed interminable the
low monotonous crooning of noc-
turnal inseas in the grass the occasional
mournful cry of a night bird the sub-
dued echo of the traffic of the distant city
-all blended into a continuous lullaby
which more than once threatened to steal
my consciousness michaelson yawned
and stretched full length on the grass
hindenburg lay with pointed nose be-
tween his outstretched paws in canine
slumber only jules de grandin remained
watchful and alert

  i was on the point of pillowing my
head upon my arm and snatching a nap
when the sudden pressure of the french-
mans fingers on my elbow roused me
see my friends he whispered he
comes

  stealthily as a shadow a figure stole
between the mounded graves toward the
flower-decked hummock beneath which
lay the body of dolores fitzpatrick the
man was dressed in some sort of dark
clothing without a single highlight of
white linen in his costume consequently
his visibility was low against the back-


weird tales

ground of the night but from the supple-
ness of his movements i realized he was
young and from the furtiveness of his
manner i knew he was afraid

  how the hell did that happen
michaelson demanded the main gates
the only one open and johnsons on
guard there with a shotgun and orders
not to let even the president of the united
states by without a written pass from


me

  ah bah de grandin whispered
there never yet was fence so high that
desperate men could not swarm over it
my friend and this one is most desperate
make no mistake concerning that

  michaelsons hand stole toward his
gun shall i wing him he asked

  mon dieu no de grandin forbade
wait till i give the word

  the great dog roused to his haunches
and opened his mouth in an almost noise-
less snarl but the frenchmans small
hand stroked his smooth head and patted
his bristling neck soothingly down
mon brave he whispered our time is
not yet children dogs and women
loved and trusted jules de grandin at
sight the savage brute rested its great
head against his knee and seemed actually
to nod understandingly in assent

  meantime the figure at the grave had
unslung a spade and pick-ax from the
pack upon its back and commenced a
furious attack on the soft untamped
earth we watched in silence from our
vantage-point saw the parapet of defiled
earth grow high and higher beside the
grave saw the digger descend lower and
lower into the trench he made from time
to time the ghoul would pause as though
to measure the task yet incomplete then
renew his attack on the yielding loam
with redoubled vigor

  it must have been an hour before he
reached his grisly goal we saw him cast
aside his spade bend forward in the
excavation and fumble at the fastenings
of the outer box which shielded the
casket from the earth some fifteen
minutes later he rose took something
from the sack which lay beside the opened
grave and twisted it between his hands

  what the hell michaelson mur-
mured wonderingly

  a sheet if i mistake not de gran-
din answered watch carefully his
technique it is good

  he was correct in his surmise it was
a sheet the resurrectionist twisted into a
rope then knotted into a sort of running
noose and dropped into the grave

  straddling the desecrated sepulcher one
foot on each lip the despoiler seized the
loose ends of the sheet twisted them to-
gether and hauled upward like a man
dragging a bucket from a curbless well

  hand over hand he drew the twisted
linen in at length his task was done and
the ravished body of dolores fitzpatrick
came once more into the outer world the
linen band knotted behind her shoulders
and crossing her breast transversely from
underneath the arms her little head
crowned with its diadem of ruddy hair
hung backward limply and her long
white arms trailed listlessly behind her as
the robber drew her from the rifled
grave and laid her on the grass

  a sharp metallic click sounded at my
elbow michaelson had cocked his pistol
and trained it on the ghoul but de gran-
dins quick wrestlers-grip upon his wrist
arrested the shot non stupid one he
bade have i not said i will say when
to shoot

  from the corner of my eye i saw this
by-play but my horrified attention was
daughter of the moonlight



riveted on the tableau at the grave the
robber had laid dolores body on the
warm dew-soaked turf composed her
limbs and folded her hands across her
quiet bosom then bent and rained a per-
fect torrent of kisses on the calm dead
face im here dear love i kept our
compact he choked between ecstatic
sobs ill keep the promise to the end
and then you shall be mine mine all
mine his voice rose almost to an hyster-
ical shriek at the end and before i
realized what he did he folded the dead
form in his arms and pressed it to his
breast as though it would respond to his
mad caresses

  good heavens a lunatic i whis-
pered a necrophiliac ive heard of
such perverts but-

  be still de grandins sharply whis-
pered admonition cut me off be quiet
great stupid-head and watch what is to
come

  the madman raised the corpse in his
arms as once i had borne her living body
through the woods gazed hurriedly
about then set off at a rapid pace toward
the rising ground which marked the cen-
ter of the cemetery

  taking cover behind the intervening
monuments we followed but our precau-
tions were unnecessary for so absorbed
in his horrid task was the grave-robber
that we might have walked at his heels
yet never been discovered

  a circular row of weeping willows
crowned the hill toward which we moved
and in the center of the ring thus marked
there stood a tall stone cross engraved
with a five-word legend

fte jmss pelobeb gleep

  to this monolith the grave-despoiler
bore his prey and laid her on the close-

cropped grass before the cross then knelt
beside the body and clasped the slim
cold hands in both of his while leaning
forward he gazed into the quiet face as
though he would melt deaths chill by the
very ardor of his glance

  and now my friends i damn think
we shall see what we shall see de gran-
din whispered observe if you please
the new moon rises

  he pointed upward as he spoke
there beyond the line of willow trees
soared the crescent moon slim as a shav-
ing from a silversmiths iathe sharp as a
sickle from the fields of demeter

  and even as i spied the moon i saw
another thing clear-cut as an image in
a shadowgraph against the moons faint
luminance came a great black-winged
owl another and still a third flying
straight for the morbid group beneath the
cross

  good lord de grandin look i
whispered but he shook my admonition
off with an impatient shrug

  do you look there my friend and
tell me what it is you see he ordered

   i glanced in the direction he indicated
then shook my head as though to clear
a film from before my eyes surely i did
but fancy it

  no there was no mistaking as the
silver shafts of moonlight fell upon it
the body of dolores fitzpatrick seemed to
gather itself together the long-limbed
looseness of post-mortem flaccidity
passed and the body was imbued with
life distinctly as i ever saw a living per-
son rise i saw the body of the girl which
had been buried that very afternoon up-
rear its head its shoulders and rouse to
a half-sitting posture more it turned a
living conscious face upon the man
beside it and smiled into his eyes


weird tales

  a low trembling whine no louder
than a crickets squeak sounded at my
feet hindenburg the great fierce dog
crouched and groveled on the grass the
hair upon his back raised in a bristling
ruff his bushy wolf-like tail held closely
to his hocks every nerve in his powerful
body trembling with abject fright

  notv you may fire my friend de
grandin ordered michaelson and at the
same time drew an automatic pistol from
his pocket and sent a bullet winging on
its way but as he fired he contrived to
stumble against michaelson so that the
latters aim was deflected

  both weapons spoke together and
there was a startled cry of pain as the echo
of the shots reverberated through the
graveyard

  quick my friends on him-ckargez
the frenchman cried leaping toward the
man and girl who huddled in the shadow
of the cross he was a step or two before
us and i observed what michaelson did
not as he reached his goal he brought
the barrel of his pistol crashing down
upon the robbers head striking him un-
conscious

  did we get him the superintendent
asked pausing beside the prostrate man

  i think so de grandin flung over
his shoulder as he bent above the girl
examine him if you please

  as michaelson bent above the man de
grandin took the womans body in his
arms

  great heavens- i began but a

sharp kick from the frenchmans boot
against my shin silenced my ejaculation
half uttered yet it was hard to restrain
myself for in the fraction of a second
while he lifted her i had seen the tiny
blue-black hole drilled through the girls
left temple by the small-calibered auto-

matic the frenchman carried and saw the
warm fresh blood gush from the wound
dead she undoubtedly was but newly
dead that bullet had crashed through
living flesh and bone into a living brain

  say this fellers alive the superin-
tendent cried hes unconscious but i

cant find a wound on him and-

  he was most likely stunned by a
glancing bullet de grandin cut in our
aim is often erratic in the dark tie him
securely and take him to the office dr
trowbridge and i will join you as soon
as we have returned this poor one to her
grave

  youre-youre sure shes dead
michaelson asked diffidently i know it
sounds crazy as hell but id have sworn

i saw her move a moment ago and-

  liens my friend our eyes play strange
tricks on us in the moonlight the
frenchman interrupted hastily come
friend trowbridge let us go

  we walked a little way in silence then
as though he were replying to my spoken
thoughts de grandin said do not press
me for an explanation now my friend
at present let us say my aim was poor
and my bullet found the wrong mark
scandal will be avoided if we let the dead
bury the dead anon i shall surely tell
you all

t think there is little to be gained by
a questioning him further de gran-
din counseled some two hours later when
michaelson had at last decided it was use-
less to press our prisoner for an explana-
tion and was on the point of calling the
police the families of all involved are
prominent and only ugly scandal can re-
sult from an expose and that would do
your cemetery little good my frieftd
this young mans actions are undoubt-
daughter of the moonlight



lesslv caused by mental derangement
doctor trowbridge and i will take charge
of him and see he is looked after mean-
time mademoiselle fitzpatricks body is
interred and none need be the wiser it
is best so nest-ce-pas

  hm guess youre right sir the
superintendent agreed well just hush
the whole rotten business up eh

  the little frenchman nodded come
friend trowbridge he said let us be
gone monsieur he bowed politely to
the prisoner we wait on your con-
venience

at his suggestion  drove directly to
cthe house and helped him escort the
captive to the study once inside de
grandin dropped his air of captor and
motioned our charge to a comfortable
chair you will smoke perhaps he
asked proffering his case then holding a
match while the other set his cigarette
aglow

  and now petit imbecile it may be
you will be good enough to explain the
reason for this evenings lunacy to us
he continued seating himself across the
desk from the prisoner and fixing him
with a level unwinking stare

  no answer

  tiens this is no coin in which to re-
pay our kindness monsieur he ex-
postulated consider how inconvenient
we might have made things-may still
make them unless you choose to talk
besides we know so much already you
would be advised to tell us the rest
you dont know anything the other
answered sullenly

  ah there is where you are most out-
rageously mistaken de grandin cor-
rected we know by example that you
are robert millington son of ralph mil-

lington cotton broker of new york and
eminent church-member of harrisonville
new jersey we know you were deeply
-passionately to the point of insanity-
in love with mademoiselle dolores we

know-

  leave her out of this the young man

blazed i wont have-

  mille pardons monsieur the french-
man corrected in a cold voice you will
have whatever we choose to give no
more no less your escapade tonight has
brought you to the very gate of prison
perhaps of the asylum for the insane and
you can best serve yourself by telling
what we wish to know you will speak
you wouldnt believe me the boy
responded sullenly

  you greatly underestimate our credu-
lity monsieur we are most trusting
we shall believe whatever you may say-
provided it be the truth

  young millington took a deep breath
like one about to dive in icy waters she
made me promise he replied

  ah we do make progress what
was it you promised her

  a flush suffused the lads cheeks then
receded leaving them pale as death i
loved her he murmured almost breath-
lessly i loved her more than anything
in the world-more than family or
friends or-he paused a moment then
in a sort of awestruck whisper-more
than the salvation of my soul

  eh bien love is like that in the
springtime of life the little frenchman
nodded understandingly he tweaked
the ends of his tightly waxed mustache
and nodded once again have not i
felt the same in the years so long buried
beneath the sod of time but certainly
ah la passion delicieuse he put his
joined thumb and forefinger to his lips


weird tales

and wafted a kiss toward the ceiling
those moonlit evenings beside the river
when we kissed and clung and shuddered
in an ecstasy of exquisite torment that
matchless combination of humility and
pride-that lunacy of adoration which
made the adored ones heel-print in the
dust more kissable than the lips of any

other woman-

  thats it-you understand the boy
broke in hoarsely thats how i felt so

when she told me-

  the little frenchmans sentimental
mood vanished like the flame of a blown-
out candle precisement when she told

you- he prompted sharply his little

round blue eyes holding the youths gaze
with an implacable unwinking stare

  she told me she was going to die-
apparently young millington returned
as though the words werewrung from his
unwilling lips she said she had an ill-
ness which only seeming death could
cure but that she wouldnt really die and
if id come to her grave and take her
from it and lay her where the first rays
of the new moon could shine on her
shed rise again in perfect health and we

could go away-

  ah poor besotted one de grandin
cried compassionately truly you would
go away for your chances of remaining in
the world when once life had returned to
those cruel jaws and force was once again
behind those tiny sharp teeth would
have been less than that of the lamb at-
tending a convention of famished wolves
no matter go on you believed her like
a silly fish you gobbled up her bait and
did become her tool in this nights work
i see i understand say no more my
poor foolish one you may go and we
shall keep your secret securely in our
breasts

  only-he laid his hand kindly on
the boys shoulder at the door-if you
possess one single shred of gratitude
when next you go to church thank god
upon your knees that your scheme failed
tonight

  thank god the boy retorted for

what

  tiens for jules de grandin if for
nothing else he answered good night
and much good luck to you petit mon-
sieur

wtow perhaps youll condescend to

  i tell me something i asked sar-
castically as the echo of young milling-
tons footsteps died away

  exactementhe agreed selecting a
cigar from the humidor and snipping off
its end with painstaking care to begin
i flout my citizenship of france like a
banner proudly displayed before the
enemy but i am a citizen of the world
as well my friend the seven seas and
five continents are no strangers to me
no i have traveled i have seen i have
observed in the lazarets of a hundred
places i have plied this gruesome trade of
patching broken bodies which we follow
good friend and the notebooks of my
memory are full of entries by example
in a stinking trading town of java i was
once called to treat a human wreck who
had loved not wisely but altogether too
well the object of his passion was a
savage she-tiger a beast-cruel sadist she
bit his lips away in the moment of em-
brace he was a most unpleasant sight
one not to be forgotten i do assure you

  very good the other evening at the
country club i did behold another poor
one similarly maimed once seen such
injuries as that are not forgotten and i
needed no second glance at the poor
daughter of the moonlight



young fabers lips to tell me he was even
as that other one in java

   now i asked me who have so
ruthlessly destroyed this young mans
looks and for what reason

  reason there was none but very lack
of reason is often the best reason of all
this mademoiselle dolores she has the
history of taking all which is most pre-
cious to her cousin not because it has a
value of its own but because her cousin
prizes it therefore i reason she who
once broke her cousins dolls have now
ravished away her fiance and broken him
too she did it from pure wantonness

  and i am right as usual next day
as i prepare to recondition the poor young
fabers lips i ask him certain questions
and he replied in writing what does he
tell me parbleu you would be aston-
ished

  he says he accompanied mademoi-
selle dolores to the clearing where the
moon shone for she had said she wished
to tell him something once there she
tells him of her love and begs that he will
desert her cousin josephine and go away
with her but no he is a young man of
good principle he will not do it he re-
pulses her ha he spoke truly who first
said hell has no fury like a scorned
woman dolores asks that young martin
will give her one little kiss in token of
farewell and all men are weak where
lovely women plead thus humbly she
lifts her face to his and all suddenly he
sees the flesh melt from off her bones and
it is in the bare-skulled face of a skeleton
he looks as he is about to kiss her

   he cries out and struggles to be free
but it are useless her slender arms are
strong as steel and her teeth-mon dieu
-her teeth are like shears of white-hot
metal they fasten on his yielding lips

and clip them clear away voila it is
done and sick with pain and horror he
staggers blindly through the trees until
we find him

  so much i learn and i think deeply
who or what are this so strange being
called dolores i ask me

  the nighttime comes i go to bed and
anon there comes a great and dreadful
bird which claws at my window and
makes dire threats against me if i divulge
what i have learned that day you say it
are an owl perhaps but does an owl
talk with human words my friend not
ordinarily you will concede

  all quickly comes the call from mon-
sieur fitzpatrick and to his house we go
to seek the lost dolores the dog leads
us well but he scents something-some-
thing evil which we can not see-and
turns to run away long since i have
learned to trust the animal instinct which
warns of evil and unseen things and so
i take us back to die house and ask for
spiritual ammunition with which to fight
the danger which awaits us in the cem-
etery

   yes i wanted to ask you about that
i interrupted wouldnt anything ex-
cept a rosary and bottle of holy water
serve as protection diat night

  many things he agreed but they
were handiest the church of rome has
no exclusive patent on fighting with and
conquering the evil ones but her methods
are always efficacious-she has waged the
battle so long and so successfully

   but why should a cross just because
it is a cross be valuable in such a case
i persisted

  he paused in thought a moment then
words much repeated with a special
significance in time acquire power he
replied witchcraft is one of the worlds


weird tales

oldest curses before egypt was the
witch-cult flourished and babylonia and
assyria both understood the witchs awful
power both had their charms against
her but they are gone and their charms
are gone with them then arose chris-
tianity and took up the battle with the
witch-brood now when a rosary is
blessed and when holy water is dedicated
the priest says certain words-always the
same and always with the same intent
the formula has become invincible
through centuries of repetition consider
you can not hear the music of your na-
tional anthem without a sudden tingling
in your cheeks a sudden contraction of
the throat a quick feeling of exaltation
words my friend the power of words
to conjure into sudden being a certain
train of thought and a definite physical
reaction so it is with prayers oft re-
peated yes

   very well with these spiritual weap-
ons we returned to the old cemetery and
there we encounter and subdue three
evil creatures which posed as bats per-
haps they were such perhaps again they
were something else at any rate we
routed them and then we found dolores
apparently lying lifeless on a long-for-
gotten grave morbleu the whole thing
stank of witchery my friend

  bethink you it was the night of
august first the feast of st peters
chains or lammas as the english-speak-
ers call it that was one of the great
gathering days of the witches of olden
times the others being candlemas in
february roodmass or may eve and all
hallow eve or halloween and my
friend in spite of all the learned fools
tell us to the contrary tvitchcraft still
lives

   through the years and centuries it has
given ground before the new religion
but in remote places it still survives in
italy despite repressive measures the old
religion as they call it la vecchia reli-
gione still numbers many followers

  and in other lands-in every land-r-
who are better fitted to keep alive the old
unholy fires of witchcraft than the
gipsies they are a race apart they
neither mingle nor intermarry with the
people among whom they live their
men may be thieves but their women are
open practisers of the black art do they
not boast of second sight and dukkering-
and charms to injure enemies or break the
spells laid on by others but yes

  nor have actual proven instances of
acts more sinister been lacking in estre-
madura four gipsy women were taken by
the spanish government and made to
own they had killed and eaten a friar a
pilgrim and a woman of their own tribe
and remember dolores mother was a
woman of the spanish gipsies that has
much bearing on the case

  you will recall i asked you if youd
read your bible lately concerning those
possessed of devils for why because
the learned numbskulls who write the
higher criticism have been at pains to
tell us demoniacal possession was but
epilepsy perhaps but will the rule not
work both ways if epilepsy may simu-
late possession by fiends why should not
such possession mimic epilepsy

  m nonsense you say ah bah i damn
think my hypothesis was proved when her
you did think dead of epilepsy came sud-
denly to life in your very arms that night

  i did foresee her second death yes
her body was the dwelling-place of evil
and had been racked by its tenants the
sleep and rest of death was needed and
daughter of the moonlight



to it she resorted such cases are not un-
known

  and so when she had apparently died
a natural death i besought that she be
embalmed or that you have her subjected
to an autopsy so that she might be for-
ever rendered incapable of functioning as
a living being again

  but she was clever-almost as clever
as i she had outguessed modern mortu-
ary science by leaving a testament ex-
pressly forbidding embalming and you
refused an autopsy

  by monsieur fitzpatricks permission
i went through all her correspondence
there she had been lax-she had not
thought of jules de grandin for he had
simulated indifference in her case and
had not called upon her once while his
good friend trowbridge was treating her
to prevent the death she had already de-
cided on

  among her papers i found but little
that would guide me but finally i came
on that which i did seek a little note
from the young millington in answer to
one of hers and in it he did renew his
promise to take her from the grave if
she should die how well she had re-
hearsed him for his role and lay her
body where the first faint rays of the new
moon might rest upon it

  that was the key my friend in
greece where warlocks still make sport
of science and religion when members of
the witch-cult desire to shift their scene
of operations or when discovery hovers
close behind them they take refuge in
the tomb they die as this one did but
always their deaths are due to some

cause which leaves no outward wound
upon their bodies-no injury which
would prevent their future functioning
then if they be exhumed and placed be-
neath the new moons rays soon after
burial they rise again as though re-
freshed by the nap taken in the grave-
and wo betide the poor unfortunate who
catches their first waking glance with
teeth and nails like maddened brute
beasts they tear his throat away and rip
his heart from- out his breast and eat it
it is their custom so to do a most un-
pleasant one i think

  accordingly we watched beside her
grave tonight we saw the poo infatu-
ated millington exhume her we saw him
bear her to the hilltop and lay her where
the moon could shine upon her we even
saw the beginning of her return to life
and wickedness but jules de grandin
nipped her resurrection in the bud by
shooting her and now her lovely body
lies in the grave with shattered brain and
never more may evil spirits use it for
their evil ends no she has said at last to
the grave thou art my father and my
mother and to corruption thou art my
lover and my bridegroom her business
in this world is finished

  but i began in the philosophy of
witchcraft-

  ho you do remind me of another
philosophy he interrupted with a grin

     who loves not woman wine and song
     remains a fool his whole life long

  i sing most execrably the love of
woman is a gift denied me but thanks
be to kindly heaven my taste for wine is
unabated come let us drink and go to
bed

like a white wraith she darted here and there
followed by the pack

have grown old and credulous
such a thing simply could not hap-
pen not in this country and not
in this day but-believe me or not as
you please-i tell you i saw it

  ever since ken graham first walked
into my classroom i have wished that i
might have had such a son and as the
years went by my fondness for him
grew and i began to dream that some
day he should take my place and com
plete the collection of minerals which has
bsroughc me and this old school fame

    

  why not after graduating with hon-
ors the boy had two years of study in
the best schools abroad and then a year
of practical work in the field what else
did he need only that i should pull
the strings my own departmental punch
dances to and have him designated as-
sistant professor of mineralogy

  so i pulled die strings and the
appointment was made but he answered
with a strange incoherent letter begging
delay

  i could not understand it perhaps
the law of the hills



that chit of a girl he had married in nor-
way preferred a director of mines with
five thousand a year to an assistant pro-
fessor with half that salary idiot
couldnt she see that i meant to make
him head of the department

   i took out of my desk die picture they
had sent from norway and all my sus-
picions vanished

   surely there was no stupid selfishness
of that sort in the mate ken graham had
chosen a sweet unspoiled young face
with a fine delicacy of feature and yet
-such a strange suggestion of wildness
that fluffy aureole of whitish hair those
keen deep-set eyes those sharply out-
lined features she looked like a beauti-
ful wild thing

  hush a jealous old mans imagin-
ings

  in the end i decided that i would go
to them i would seek them out and
bring them back this old stone house
was big enough for all of us to be happy
in if happiness was possible old men
are arrogant sometimes-and i had set
my mind on spending the rest of my
days near the boy i had learned to love
as a son

   when i got off the train they told me
where i should find him it was late
but he would still be in his office the
expressman said

  a bear for work that graham hes
never stopped since his wife died too
bad about his wife the wolves got her
and louis bar j on one night just a few
weeks ago a great pity-a great pity

  oh my boy my poor poor boy

   i could see him as i came up the walk
his head bent over his hands before the
uncurtained window

  i tapped on the door and walked in

  you professor you what brought
you here

  rocks my boy i lied rocks
specimens clarke at ten mile has un-
earthed a curious fossil-some sort of
dig he says he claims its jurassic per-
mian hes set it far too early of course
but  came along to look at it but
theres time for that tomorrow i wanted
to have a chat with you

  and no one could be more welcome
he returned come inside its late
and you have had a long hard trip in
of course i had-a damned hard trip
in im getting old and thirty hours on
a little one-horse railroad is no joke to
me but i did not intend to be bundled
off to bed until i had got to the bottom
of this thing that was making my boy
look like a man who had been through
the valley of death

   im sleeping here now he explained
as he took me into a little room off his
office i had this place built some weeks

ago after-

   he did not finish but stooped and set
a match to the fire the great pine knots
flamed and roared in the open fireplace
he boiled water and made tea talking
all the time of mines and mine-manage-
ment and minerals

we smoked in silence a long while
after he had put the cups away
then i leaned over and put my hand on
his knee

  ken my boy could you tell the old
man

   he started and looked at me seardiing-

ly-

you wouldnt believe me professor
i am not a scoffer son i answered
he rose and threw another knot of
pine on die fire i watched the flames


weied tales

curl up and around it the young mans
face was lost in shadow

  do you believe in lycantrophy

  of course not there is no such
thing

  of course not there never was such
a thing and yet i tell you i have seen
it happen

  was the boy insane why that was
old english superstition it belonged to
the days of witchcraft and burnings
never since the sixteenth century had
intelligent men of any country in the
world save russia talked of such things
seriously absurd

  my wife he went on without look-
ing up never knew much about her
father he was killed it was said in a
hunting accident the second winter after
his marriage his wife died of shock
the day the news reached her and left
a little daughter two hours old that is
all hilde ever knew of her parents

  she was brought up on the old estate
under the personal direction of her
grandfather he was passionately fond
of her but he watched with an eagle eye
over all her study and her play the old
man was a constant contradiction to
hilde he would never allow her living
pets of any kind for one thing he
took her to england france and egypt
but never permitted her to holiday in the
mountains of her own beloved norway
even when she went to torghatten her
course of study was laid down by that
inconsistent old man he seemed to show
his affection for her by suppressing all
the instincts that were strongest

  it was at torghatten that i met her
-and we loved each other

  the old gentleman received me with
great kindness when i visited him he
had many questions to ask me about my

parentage and my work i answered
them all as i could and did not wonder
much at the seriousness with which he
asked them though i had the impression
continually that there was something he
wanted to say to me something that
preyed upon his mind at times he
seemed happy in our happiness and
planned with us the details of our mar-
riage then in the very midst of the
planning he would start up with fear in
his face and speak as if it all must stop

  once he started to say something
about his son hildes father but stopped
short before he had well begun

  to the very day we sailed from nor-
way he was a constant puzzle to us

  when this offer came from meakins
 company i hesitated to bring my
bride into a rough camp like this but
hilde insisted she would love it all
her life she wanted to live in the solitary
places to climb hills and be free she
begged me to accept at once

  we came north a few days later as
you know i built her a little bungalow
on the hill yonder just across the river
before i had the foundation laid she had
flowers growing all about the place
native flowers which she had never seen
before but which she transplanted and
tended with passionate care

  she turned our little cabin into a very
bower of beauty and there was not in the
world anyone more exultantly happy
than she

  often she took long walks alone
while i was at the mill i have come
home many times to find a note on the
table to say that we would have tea on
the baldman she would be waiting
there with a picnic supper and all
through the long summer days we were
the law of the hills



happier by far than i had ever dreamed
of being

  then came winter

  all of a sudden it came the cold
set in overnight a driving storm that
lasted for three days buried the country-
side in drifts it was the northern winter
at its worst

  one night-here the boy paused to
breathe heavily and his face was set-
one night we were sitting cozily by the
fire reading when suddenly a woif
howled quite near

  hilde went deathly white and
clutched my hand

  i took her in my arms and laughed
at her and told her there was no cause
for alarm and that his majesty would be
bold indeed and very hungry before he
would dare attack any human

  but nodiing that i could say really
comforted her and from that time on
she w-as in terror of being left alone
especially at night

a month or so later i was kept late
x at the mill and it wras nearly
eleven before i started home going up
the hill i heard the wolves again there
is no mistaking the cry of the timber
wolf and i ran up the steps hoping that
hilde had not heard

  there was no light in the house and
 tiptoed into her room trying not to
wake her till the sound had died away

  the moon shone in the window and
there was my girl crouched down on the
floor peering out into the night she
seemed in the grip of an agony of emo-
tion dreadful to see and did not know
diat i was there at all

  i touched her on the shoulder she
turned like a flash and looked at me for
a moment with only fear in her face

then she crumpled up in my arms and
sobbed hysterically until she fell asleep

  ken drew a gusty sigh and paused his
pipe forgotten in his hand

  i could not understand it at all he
went on she was not a coward theres
a little lake up in the hills where we used
to swim and i have seen her dive into
the water from twenty feet up the cliff
so it was more than fear that troubled
her it was some deeper dread of which
she could not speak

  she was never her old self after that
night when she cried hefself to sleep at
times she would lavish passionate tear-
ful love on me at other times she was
absent-minded and lost in somber reflec-
tions of her owrn

  one night when i came early home
she was not there i was searching
frantically for her when she came quietly
up the path bareheaded and alone
there was such a look in her eyes as i
have seen in the eyes of the dead and i
followed her in silence into the house
fear clutching at my heart

  the wolves were frequently to be
heard in those days the heavy snow
had made them very bold once they
came so close to the house that i reached
for my rifle determined to teach at least
one of them a lesson in restraint but
hilde caught my arm and stopped me

i knew her tenderness for wild
things and put my  away in the shed

  when i came back into the room she
was not there vaguely uneasy i
searched for her in the bedroom she
was not there but the window was
open and i saw among the trees a lithe
gray-white form that flashed across the
shadows and was gone

  i wont go into the details of that
night all sorts of horrors came to me-


weird tales

old folk-tales of norway that the people
of the hills believed in stories of the
taint that ran in certain families and of
the dread deeds done at night by the
will of the foul fiend i kept wonder-
ing too about the death of hildes
father and asking over and over again
whether i had gone out of my mind

  suddenly the door opened and there
stood hilde her fair hair white with
loose fluffs of snow she looked tired
and worn and with only a furtive glance
at me she hurried to her room and slept
heavily till noon

  she was frequently absent after that
and i never knew when i came home at
night whether she would be there or
not

  again the boy paused staring at the
fire and again he went on

  one day there was an explosion at
the northern mine and i went up to try
and get things moving again no train
came out that night so i decided to
tramp the eleven miles back rather than
leave hilde alone

  just a few miles from home i re-
alized that i -was being followed by
wolves i was not armed and there was
nothing for it but to climb a tree a
broken-off oak stump stood near the
track it offered no protection from the
wind but i knew that from it i should
be able to hail the log train in the morn-
ing if necessary so i scrambled up in
some haste

  within two minutes there were four-
teen timber wolves squatting in a circle
about that stump you know their meth-
od-a short wait to see if youre going to
run for it then a half turn to the left
and a steady circling march around their
victim

  i dont know what the end of

that death-march would have been for
just as i was bending all my will-power
to fight the hypnotism of it there dashed
down the railway track a slender white
wolf like a mad thing she darted here
and there about that circle then flashed
away among the trees with the whole
pack behind her

  i waited till their cry had died away
in the distance then climbed stiffly down
and hurried home hilde was waiting
for me at the door there was a curious
brightness in her eyes and she listened
with some tension i thought to the ex-
planation of my lateness but i said
nothing at all of my adventure with the
wolves

  few nights later louis barjon
a dropped in after supper for once
hilde was almost herself she was read-
ing by the fire while louis and i
smoked

   never saw the wolves so bold as this
year said louis have you seen the
white one white as a snow-drift she is
and swift as the wind she seems to
come out of nowhere to join the pack
and theyre devils when shes with them
shes the most beautiful animal ive ever
seen but i bet shes as keen on the kill
as any of the dirty crew

  hilde dropped her book the white
wolf never kills she said

  louis turned and looked at her in
astonishment was it merely girlish
sentiment for a lovely wild thing evi-
dently louis thought so for he laughed
tolerantly and went on well maybe
but folks is laying for her its hardly
safe to go out at night so keep your rifle
handy boy

  i remembered the one night when i
did take my rifle down i glanced at
the law of the hills



hilde her eyes were wide and her
nostrils dilated what was the emotion
that swayed her my heart contracted

   did you ever see her demanded
louis again i thought of the gray-white
form i had seen flitting among the trees
and of the beautiful white beast that had
saved me from the pack only a few
nights before but i shook my head in
denial

   tve seen her twice he went on
the other night i took a flying shot at
her and i caught her on the right front
paw but it was just a scratch i guess
for there was only a bit of blood on the
snow

  in spite of myself i glanced at
hildes right forearm she had it tightly
bandaged i looked up at her face her
eyes were fixed on the back of louis
head as he picked a coal out of the fire
for his pipe

  was it only fancy or did her lips
draw back from her white teeth

  my heart seemed to stop beating
that picture is engraved on my mind for-
ever old louis bluff and weather-
beaten leaning down over the fire hilde
watching him with a sort of sinister
ferocity and i dumb with terror

  in silence i let him rise and wind
his long scarf about his neck and go out
into the night

  i shut the door behind him and
turned hastily to hilde i was too late
she was gone i went to her bedroom
she was not there nor in any other room
in the house

  a sense of black tragedy engulfed
me i clung with all my might to my
love for her and i prayed to know the
secret the old man in norway would
have told me before we came away

  my whole soul revolted at the con-
clusions that were forcing themselves on
me and i waited in horror for what the
morning would bring i dont think i
thought much after a while my mind
seemed numbed i just sat and waited
with a curious sense of waiting for more
than her coming home

  toward morning it started to snow
heavily i built up the fire and put the
kettle on to boil

   then i heard a sound outside a whin-
ing and a heavy scratching sound i flung
open the door

  call me mad if you will-but there
in the snow was the white wolf she was
staggering and covered with blood and
scarcely able to drag her hindquarters
into the room the beautiful animal
crawled weakly to my feet and rubbed
her head against my knee like a dog

  i took her head between my hands
and she looked up with those pleading
eyes i knew licked my hand once or
twice and sank on the floor-dead

  i knew my girl would never come
home again

  i knew-god that such things
should be-that the old law of the hills
had held that ancient dreadful law that
said there was no return for the were-
wolf that once had spilled the blood of
human kind

  i knew too what they would tell me
that day-that old louis was dead that
he had accounted for half the pack before
they had got him but that they had got
him in the end

  and then i told them that my wife
had gone with louis that she had gone
to spend a day with his wife to help her
with the quilting they were deeply dis-
tressed and searched everywhere but
they found no trace or sign of her at all


weird tales

  i buried the white wolf that night
under the pine trees and the wolves
howled about the place till dawn

  since then i have waited hoping
against hope that some day i will wake
and find that i have only been insane

  i have not the courage to sleep at the
cottage now but i go there every day to
see if perhaps she has come home but i
know as there is a god in heaven that
all that is mortal of my girl lies buried
there under the pine trees where her
garden was last year

for an hour he sat there his head
bowed in suffering till from sheer
weariness he slept in his chair

  i threw a coat around him and built
up the fire and sat there thinking think-
ing thinking in amazement and dread

  the thing could not be of course
yet i had lived near enough to mother
earth to know that there are more things
under heaven than science has ever
dreamed of

  but the proof of it i had to have
some proof

  i sat there till daylight then i made
strong coffee for the lad and we had
breakfast when he woke i told him all

that was going on around the old halls
confessed that i had lied to him about
clarkes fossilized pig and saw a hint of
the old twinkle return to his eyes

  then i slipped away

  now i should test this thing within
the hour i should know whethc-r the lad
had dreamed an ugly dream or had been
the victim of devils work

  the cottage door was unlocked wait-
ing hildes return things were just as
she had left them no doubt-her work-
bag in the corner the book she had been
reading open on the table but i did not
pause there i went on through to the
garden

  the grave was clearly marked by a
blazed cross on the giant pine frantical-
ly i began to dig and as i turned out the
loose sand i prayed that i might prove
that the boy had only dreamed

  i made my gruesome find with my
hands i scraped away the earth that
covered the bare skull and the bony paws
with my fingers i pried the long rows of
teeth apart and looked

  god was i too gone mad

  in the sharp canines were little pits of
yellow and one large molar had a solid
cap of gold

on the gravelly floor
lay the horror

for one who has never faced the
danger of legal execution i have a
rather queer horror of the electric
chair as a subject indeed i think the
topic gives me more of a shudder than it
gives many a man who has been on trial
for his life the reason is that i associate
the thing with an incident of forty years
ago - a very strange incident which
brought me close to the edge of the un-
knowns black abyss

  in  i was an auditor and investi-
gator connected with the tlaxcala mining
company of san francisco which operated
several small silver and copper properties
in the san mateo mountains in mexico
there had been some trouble at mine no
 which had a surly furtive assistant
superintendent named arthur feldon
and on august th the firm received a
telegram saying that feldon had de-
camped taking with him all the stock rec-


weird tales

ords securities and private papers and
leaving the whole clerical and financial
situation in dire confusion

  this development was a severe blow to
the company and late in the afternoon
president mccomb called me into his of-
fice to give orders for the recovery of the
papers at any cost there were he knew
grave drawbacks i had never seen feldon
and there were only very indifferent photo-
graphs to go by moreover my own
wedding was set for thursday of the fol-
lowing week-only nine days ahead-so
that i was naturally not eager to be hurried
off to mexico on a man-hunt of indefinite
length the need however was so great
that mccomb felt justified in asking me to
go at once and i for my part decided that
the effect on my status with the company
would make ready acquiescence eminently
worth while

  i was to start that night using the
presidents private car as far as mexico
city after which i would have to take a
narrow-gage railway to the mines jack-
son the superintendent of no  would
give me all details and any possible clues
upon my arrival and then the search
would begin in earnest - through the
mountains down to the coast or among
the byways of mexico city as the case
might be i set out with a grim determina-
tion to get the matter done-and success-
fully done-as swiftly as possible and
tempered my discontent with pictures of
an early return with papers and culprit
and of a wedding which would be almost
a triumphal ceremony

  having notified my family fiancee and
principal friends and made hasty prepa-
rations for the trip i met president mc-
comb at eight p m at the southern pa-
cific depot received from him some writ-
ten instructions and a check-book and
left in his car attached to the eight-fifteen

eastbound transcontinental train the
journey that followed seemed destined for
uneventfulness and after a good nights
sleep i revelled in the ease of the private
car so thoughtfully assigned me reading
my instructions with care and formulating
plans for the capture of feldon and the re-
covery of the documents i knew the
tlaxcala country quite well - probably
much better than the missing man-hence
had a certain amount of advantage in my
search unless he had already used the rail-
way

  according to the instructions feldon
had been a subject of worry to superin-
tendent jackson for some time acting
secretively and working unaccountably in
the companys laboratory at odd hours
that he was implicated with a mexican
boss and several peons in some thefts of
ore was strongly suspected but though
the natives had been discharged there was
not enough evidence to warrant any posi-
tive step regarding the subtle official in-
deed despite his furtiveness there seemed
to be more of defiance than of guilt in the
mans bearing he wore a chip on his
shoulder and talked as if the company
were cheating him instead of his cheating
the company the obvious surveillance of
his colleagues jackson wrote appeared to
irritate him increasingly and now he had
gone with everything of importance in the
office of his possible whereabouts no
guess could be made though jacksons
final telegram suggested the wild slopes of
the sierra de malinche that tall myth-
surrounded peak with the corpse-shaped
silhouette from whose neighborhood the
thieving natives were said to have come

  at el paso which we reached at two
a m of the night following our start my
private car was detached from the trans-
continental train and joined to an engine
specially ordered by telegraph to take it
the electric executioner

southward to mexico city i continued to
drowse till dawn and all the next day
grew bored on the flat desert chihuahua
landscape the crew had told me we were
due in mexico city at noon friday but i
soon saw that countless delays were wast-
ing precious hours there were waits on
sidings all along the single-tracked route
and now and then a hot-box or other diffi-
cult would further complicate the sched-
ule

  at torreon we were six hours late and
it was almost eight oclock on friday eve-
ning-fully twelve hours behind schedule
-when the conductor consented to do
some speeding in an effort to make up
time my nerves were on edge and i could
do nothing but pace the car in desperation
in the end i found that the speeding had
been purchased at a high cost indeed for
within a half-hour the symptoms of a hot-
box had developed in my car itself so that
after a maddening wait the crew decided
that all the bearings would have to be
overhauled after a quarter-speed limp
ahead to the next station with shops-the
factory town of queretaro this was the
last straw and i almost stamped like a
child actually i sometimes caught my-
self pushing at my chair-arm as if trying to
urge the train forward at a less snail-like
pace

  it was almost ten in the evening when
we drew into queretaro and i spent a fret-
ful hour on the station platform while my
car was sidetracked and tinkered at by a
dozen native mechanics at last they told
me the job was too much for them since
the forward truck needed new parts which
could not be obtained nearer than mexico
city everything indeed seemed against
me and i gritted my teeth when i thought
of feldon getting farther and farther away
-perhaps to the easy cover of vera cruz
with its shipping or mexico city with its

varied rail facilities-while fresh delays
kept me tied and helpless of course
jackson had notified the police in all the
cities around but i knew with sorrow what
their efficiency amounted to

  the best i could do i soon found out
was to take the regular night express for
mexico city which ran from aguas
calientes and made a five-minute stop at
queretaro it would be along at one a m
if on time and was due in mexico city at
five oclock saturday morning when 
purchased my ticket i found that the train
would be made up of european compart-
ment carriages instead of long american
cars with rows of two-seat chairs these
had been much used in the early days ot
mexican railroading owing to the euro-
pean construction interests back of the
first lines and in  the mexican cen-
tral was still running a fair number of
them on its shorter trips ordinarily i pre-
fer the american coaches since i hate to
have people facing me but for this once
i was glad of the foreign carriage at such
a time of night i stood a good chance
of having a whole compartment to myself
and in my tired nervously hypersensitive
state i welcomed the solitude-as well a
the comfortably upholstered seat with soft
arm-rests and head-cushion running the
whole width of the vehicle i bought a
first class ticket obtained my valise from
the sidetracked private car telegraphed
both president mccomb and jackson of
what had happened and settled down in
the station to wait for the night express as
patiently as my strained nerves would let
me

for a wonder the train was only half
an hour late though even so the soli-
tary station vigil had about finished my
endurance the conductor showing me
into a compartment told me he expected


weird tales

to make up the delay and reach the capital
on time and i stretched myself comfort-
ably on the forward-facing seat in the ex-
pectation of a quiet three-and-a-half hour
run the light from the overhead oil
lamp was soothingly dim and i wondered
whether i could snatch some much-needed
sleep in spite of my anxiety and nerve-
tension it seemed as the train jolted into
motion that i was alone and i was hearti-
ly glad of it my thoughts leaped ahead
to my quest and i nodded with the accel-
erating rhythm of the speeding string of
carriages

  then suddenly i perceived that i was
not alone after all in the corner diagon-
ally opposite me slumped down so that
his face was invisible sat a roughly clad
man of unusual size whom the feeble
light had failed to reveal before beside
him on the seat was a huge valise bat-
tered and bulging and tightly gripped
even in his sleep by one of his incongru-
ously slender hands as the engine
whistled sharply at some curve or crossing
the sleeper started nervously into a kind
of watchful half-awakening raising his
head and disclosing a handsome face
bearded and clearly anglo-saxon with
dark lustrous eyes at sight of me his
wakefulness became complete and i won-
dered at the rather hostile wildness of his
glance no doubt i thought he resented
my presence when he had hoped to have
the compartment alone all the way just as
i was myself disappointed to find strange
company in the half-lighted carriage the
best we could do however was to accept
the situation gracefully so i began apolo-
gizing to the man for my intrusion he
seemed to be a fellow-american and we
would both feel more at ease after a few
civilities then we could leave each other
in peace for the balance of the journey

  to my surprize the stranger did not re-
spond to my courtesies with so much as a
word instead he kept staring at me
fiercely and almost appraisingly and
brushed aside my embarrassed proffer of a
cigar with a nervous lateral movement of
his disengaged hand his other hand still
tensely clutched the great worn valise and
his whole person seemed to radiate some
obscure malignity after a time he abrupt-
ly turned his face toward the window
though there was nothing to see in the
dense blackness outside oddly he ap-
peared to be looking at something as in-
tently as if there really were something to
look at i decided to leave him to his own
curious devices and meditations without
further annoyance so settled back in my
seat drew the brim of my soft hat over my
face and closed my eyes in an effort to
snatch the sleep i had half-counted on

  i could not have dozed very long or
very fully when my eyes fell open as if in
response to some external force closing
them again with some determination i re-
newed my quest of a nap yet wholly with-
out avail an intangible influence seemed
bent on keeping me awake so raising my
head i looked about the dimly lighted
compartment to see if anything were amiss
all appeared normal but i noticed that
the stranger in the opposite corner was
looking at me very intently-intently
though without any of the geniality or
friendliness which would have implied a
change from his former surly attitude i
did not attempt conversation this time but
leaned back in my previous sleepy posture
half closing my eyes as if i had dozed off
once more yet continuing to watch him
curiously from beneath my down-turned
hat brim

  as the train rattled onward through the
night i saw a subtle and gradual metamor-
phosis come over the expression of the
the electric executioner



staring man evidently satisfied that i was
asleep he allowed his face to reflect a curi-
ous jumble of emotions the nature of
which seemed anything but reassuring
hatred fear triumph and fanaticism
flickered compositely over the lines of his
lips and the angles of his eyes while his
gaze became a glare of really alarming
greed and ferocity suddenly it dawned
upon me that this man was mad and dan-
gerously so

   i will not pretend that i was anything
but deeply and thoroughly frightened
when i saw how things stood perspira-
tion started out all over me and i had hard
work to maintain my attitude of relaxa-
tion and slumber life had many attrac-
tions for me just then and the thought of
dealing with a homicidal maniac-possi-
bly armed and certainly powerful to a
marvelous degree-was a dismaying and
terrifying one my disadvantage in any
sort of struggle was enormous for the
man was a virtual giant evidently in the
best of athletic trim while i have always
been rather frail and was then almost
worn out with anxiety sleeplessness and
nervous tension it was undeniably a bad
moment for me and i felt pretty close to
a horrible death as i recognized the fury of
madness in the strangers eyes events
from the past came up into my conscious-
ness as if for a farewell-just as a drown-
ing mans whole life is said to resurrect
itself before him at the last moment

   of course i had my revolver in my coat
pocket but any motion of mine to reach
and draw it would be instantly obvious
moreover if i did secure it there was no
telling what effect it would have on the
maniac even if i shot him once or twice
he might have enough remaining strength
to get the gun from me and deal with me
in his own way or if he were armed him-

self he might shoot or stab without trying
to disarm me one can cow a sane man
by covering him with a pistol but an in-
sane mans complete indifference to conse-
quences gives him a strength and menace
quite superhuman for the time being
even in those pre-freudian days i had a
common-sense realization of the danger-
ous power of a person without normal in-
hibitions that the stranger in the corner
was indeed about to start some murderous
action his burning eyes and twitching
facial muscles did not permit me to doubt
for a moment

  suddenly i heard his breath begin to
come in excited gasps and saw his chest
heaving with mounting excitement the
time for a showdown was close and i
tried desperately to think of the best thing
to do without interrupting my pretense
of sleep i began to slide my right hand
gradually and inconspicuously toward the
pocket containing my pistol watching the
madman closely as i did so to see if he
would detea any move unfortunately he
did-almost before he had time to register
the fact in his expression with a bound
so agile and abrupt as to be almost incred-
ible in a man of his size he was upon me
before i knew what had happened loom-
ing up and swaying forward like a giant
ogre of legend and pinioning me with
one powerful hand while with the other
he forestalled me in reaching the revolver
taking it from my pocket and placing it
in his own he released me contemptu-
ously well knowing how fully his phy-
sique placed me at his mercy then he
stood up at his full height-his head al-
most touching the roof of the carriage-
and stared-down at me with eyes whose
fury had quickly turned to a look of pity-
ing scorn and ghoulish calculation

ibid not move and after a moment the
man resumed his seat opposite me i
sriitfing a ghastly smile as he opened his
great bulging valise and extracted an arti-
cle of peculiar appearance-a rather large
cage of semi-flexible wire woven some-
what like a baseball catchers mask but
shaped more like the helmet of a diving-
suit its top was connected with a cord
whose other end remained in the valise
this device he fondled with obvious af-
fection cradling it in his lap as he looked
at me afresh and licked his bearded lips
with an almost feline motion of the
tongue then for the first time he spoke
-in a deep mellow voice of a softness
and cultivation startlingly at variance with
his rough corduroy clothes and unkempt
aspect

   you are fortunate sir i shall use you
first of all you shall go into history as
the first fruits of a remarkable invention
vast sociological consequences-i shall
let my light shine as it were im radiat-
ing all the time but nobody knows it now
you shall know intelligent guinea-pig
cats and burros-it worked even with a
burro 

   he paused while his bearded features
underwent a convulsive motion closely
synchronized with a vigorous gyratory
shaking of the whole head it was as
though he were shaking clear of some
nebulous obstructing medium for the
gesture was followed by a clarification or
subtilization of expression which hid the
more obvious madness in a look of suave
composure through which the craftiness
gleamed only dimly i glimpsed the dif-
ference at once and put in a word to see
if i could lead his mind into harmless
channels

   you seem to have a marvelously fine
instrument if im any judge wont
you tell me how you came to invent it

  he nodded

   mere logical reflection dear sir i
consulted the needs of the age and acted
upon them others might have done the
same had their minds been as powerful-
that is as capable of sustained concentra-
tion-as mine i had the sense of con-
viction-the available will-power-that
is all i realized as no one else has yet
realized how imperative it is to remove
everybody from the earth before quetzal-
coatl comes back and realized also that
it must be done elegantly i hate butch-
ery of any kind and hanging is barbar-
ously crude you know last year the
new york legislature voted to adopt elec-
tric execution for condemned men-but
all the apparatus they have in mind is
as primitive as stephensons rocket or
davenports first electric engine i knew
of a better way and told them so but they
paid no attention to me god the fools
as if i didnt know all there is to know
about men and death and electricity-
student man and boy-technologist and
engineer-soldier of fortune 

   he leaned back and narrowed his eyes

  i was in maximilians army twenty
years and more ago they were going
to make me a nobleman then those
damned greasers killed him and i had to
go home but i came back-back and
forth back and forth i live in roches-
ter n y

  his eyes grew deeply crafty and he
leaned forward touching me on the knee
with the fingers of a paradoxically deli-
cate hand

   i came back i say and i went deeper
than any of them i hate greasers but i
like mexicans a puzzle listen to me

there can be no doubt any peon south

as it were-of killing just a few every-
body is a murderer-they murder ideas-
steal inventions-stole mine by watching

and watching and watching-

  the man choked and paused and i
spoke soothingly

  im sure your invention was much the
better and probably theyll come to use
it in the end

  evidently my taa was not great

enough for his response showed fresh
irritation

   sure are you nice mild con-
servative assurance cursed lot you care

-but youll soon know why damn
you all the good there ever will be in that
elearic chair will have been stolen from
me the ghost of nezahualpilli told me
that on the sacred mountain they
watched and watched and watched-

  he choked again then gave another of
those gestures in which he seemed to
shake both his head and his facial ex-
pression that seemed temporarily to
steady him

  what my invention needs is testing
this is it-here the wire hood or

among the politicians of san francisco
where i come from they need your
treatment and id like to help you intro-
duce it but really i think i can help
you in all truth i have some influence
in sacramento and if youll go back to the
states with me after im through with my
business in mexico ill see that you get
a hearing

   he answered soberly and civilly

  no-i cant go back i swore not to
when those criminals at albany turned
down my invention and set spies to watch
me and steal from me but i must have
american subjects those greasers are
under a curse and would be too easy
and the full-blood indians-the real chil-
dren of the feathered serpent-are sacred
and inviolate except for proper sacrificial
victims    and even those must be slain
according to ceremony i must have
americans without going back-and the
first man i choose will be signally hon-
ored do you know who he is

   i temporized desperately

   oh if thats all the trouble ill find
you a dozen first-rate yankee specimens
as soon as we get to mexico city i know
where there are lots of small mining men
who wouldnt be missed for days-

  but he cut me short with a new and
sudden air of authority which had a touch
of real dignity in it

   thatll do-weve trifled long enough
get up and stand erect like a man youre
the subject ive chosen and youll thank
me for the honor in the other world just
as the sacrificial victim thanks the priest
for transferring him to eternal glory a
new principle-no other man alive has
dreamed of such a battery and it might
never again be hit on if the world ex-
perimented a thousand years do you
know that atoms arent what they seem j

fools a century after this some dolt
would be guessing if i were to let the
world live

as i arose at his command he drew

-	additional feet of cord from the
valise and stood erect beside me the wire
helmet outstretched toward me in both
hands and a look of real exaltation on his
tanned and bearded face for an instant
he seemed like a radiant hellenic mysta-
gogue or hierophant

  here o youth-a libation wine of
the cosmos-nectar of the starry spaces-
linos - iacchus - ialemus-zagreus-
dionysos-atys-hylas - sprung from
apollo and slain by the hounds of argos
-seed of psamathe-child of the sun-
evoe evoe

  he was chanting again and this time
his mind seemed far back amongst the
classic memories of his college days in
my erect posture i noticed the nearness of
the signal cord overhead and wondered
whether i could reach it through some
gesture of ostensible response to his cere-
monial mood it was worth trying so
with an antiphonal cry of evoe i put
my arms forward and upward toward him
in a ritualistic fashion hoping to give the
cord a tug before he could notice the act
but it was useless he saw my purpose
and moved one hand toward the right-
hand coat pocket where my revolver lay
no words were needed and we stood for
a moment like carven figures then he
quietly said make haste

  again my mind rushed frantically
about seeking avenues of escape the
doors i knew were not locked on mexi-
can trains but my companion could easily
forestall me if i tried to unlatch one and
jump out besides our speed was so
great that success in that direction would

probably be as fatal as failure the only
thing to do was to play for time of the
three-and-a-half-hour trip a good slice was
already worn away and once we got to
mexico city the guards and police in the
station would provide instant safety

  there would i thought be two dis-
tinct times for diplomatic stalling if i
could get him to postpone the slipping on
of the hood that much time would be
gained of course i had no belief that
the thing was really deadly but i knew
enough of madmen to understand what
would happen when it failed to work to
his disappointment would be added a
mad sense of my responsibility for the
failure and the result would be a red chaos
of murderous rage therefore the ex-
periment must be postponed as long as
possible yet the second opportunity did
exist for if i planned cleverly i might de-
vise explanations for the failure which
would hold his attention and lead him
into more or less extended searches for
corrective influences i wondered just
how far his credulity went and whether i
could prepare in advance a prophecy of
failure which would make the failure it-
self stamp me as a seer or initiate or per-
haps a god i had enough of a smatter-
ing of mexican mythology to make it
worth trying though i would try other de-
laying influences first and let the prophecy
come as a sudden revelation would he
spare me in the end if i could make him
think me a prophet or divinity could i
get by as quetzalcoatl or huitzilo-
potchli anything to drag matters out
till five oclock when we were due in
mexico city

   but my opening stall was the veteran
will-making ruse as the maniac repeat-
ed his command for haste i told him of
my family and intended marriage and

asked for the privilege of leaving a mes-
sage and disposing of my money and ef-
fects if i said he would lend me some
paper and agree to mail what i should
write i could die more peacefully and
willingly after some cogitation he gave
a favorable verdict and fished in his va-
lise for a pad which he handed me sol-
emnly as i resumed my seat i produced
a pencil artfully breaking the point at the
outset and causing some delay while he
searched for one of his own when he
gave me this he took my broken pencil
and proceeded to sharpen it with a large
horn-handled knife which had been in his
belt under his coat evidently a second
pencil-breaking would not profit me
greatly

   what i wrote i can hardly recall at
this date it was largely gibberish and
composed of random scraps of memor-
ized literature when i could think of noth-
ing else to set down i made my hand-
writing as illegible as i could without de-
stroying its nature as writing for i knew
he would be likely to look at the result
before commencing his experiment and
realized how he would reaa to the sight
of obvious nonsense the ordeal was a
terrible one and i chafed each second at
the slowness of the train in the past i
had often whistled a brisk gallop to the
sprightly tac of wheels on rails but
now the tempo seemed slowed down to
that of a funeral march-my funeral
march i grimly reflected

   my ruse worked till i had covered over
four pages six by nine when at last the
madman drew out his watch and told me
i could have but five minutes more what
should i do next i was hastily going
through the form of concluding the will
when a new idea struck me ending
with a flourish and handing him the fia-


weird tales

ished sheets which he thrust carelessly
into his left-hand coat pocket i reminded
him of my influential sacramento friends
who would be so much interested in his
invention

  oughtnt i to give you a letter of in-
troduction to them i said oughtnt
i to make a signed sketch and description
of your executioner so that theyll grant
you a cordial hearing they can make
you famous you know-and theres no
question at all but that theyll adopt your
method for the state of california if they
hear of it through someone like me whom
they know and trust

  i was taking this tack on the chance
that his thoughts as a disappointed inven-
tor would let him forget the aztec-relig-
ious side of his mania for a while when
he veered to the latter again i reflected
i would spring the revelation and
prophecy the scheme worked for
his eyes glowed an eager assent though
he bruskly told me to be quick he fur-
ther emptied the valise lifting out a
queer-looking congeries of glass cells and
coils to which the wire from the helmet
was attached and delivering a fire of run-
ning comment too technical for me to fol-
low yet apparently quite plausible and
straightforward i pretended to note down
all he said wondering as i did so whether
the queer apparatus was really a battery
after all would i get a slight shock
when he applied the device the man
surely talked as if he were a genuine elec-
trician description of his own inven-
tion was clearly a congenial task for him
and i saw he was not as impatient as be-
fore the hopeful gray of dawn glim-
mered through the windows before he
wound up and i felt at last that my
chance of escape had really become tan-
gible

  but he too saw the dawn and began
glaring wildly again he knew the train
was due in mexico city at five and would
certainly force quick action unless i could
override all his judgment with engrossing
ideas as he rose with a determined air
setting the battery on the seat beside the
open valise i reminded him that i had
not made the needed sketch and asked
him to hold the headpiece so that i could
draw it near the battery he complied
and resumed his seat but with many ad-
monitions to me to hurry after another
moment i paused for some information
asking him how the victim was placed for
execution and how his presumable strug-
gles were overcome

  why he replied the criminal is
securely strapped to a post it does not
matter how much he tosses his head for
the helmet fits tightly and draws even
closer when the current comes on we
turn the switch gradually-you see it
here a carefully arranged affair with a
rheostat

  a new idea for delay occurred to me as
the tilled fields and increasingly frequent
houses in the dawnlight outside told of
our approach to the capital at last

  but i said i must draw the helmet
in place on a human head as well as be-
side the battery cant you slip it on
yourself a moment so that i can sketch
you with it the papers as well as the
officials will want all this and they are
strong on completeness

  i had by chance made a better shot
than i had planned for at my mention of
the press the madmans eyes lit up afresh

  the papers yes-damn them you
can make even the papers give me a hear-
ing they all laughed at me and wouldnt
print a word-here you hurry up weve
not a second to lose
the electric executioner



  he had slipped the headpiece on and
was watching my flying pencil avidly
the wire mask gave him a grotesque
comic look as he sat there with nervously
twitching hands

  now curse em theyll print pic-
tures ill revise your sketch if you make
any blunders-must be accurate at any
cost police will find you afterward-
theyll tell how it works associated press
item-back up your letter-immortal
fame    hurry i say-hurry confound

     i

you

the train was lurching over the poor-
er roadbed near the city and we
swayed disconcertingly now and then
with this excuse i managed to break the
pencil again but of course the maniac at
once handed me my own which he had
sharpened my first batch of ruses was
about used up and i felt that i should
have to submit to the headpiece in a mo-
ment we were still a good quarter-
hour from the terminal and it was about
time for me to divert my companion to his
religious side and spring the divine
prophecy

  mustering up my scraps of nahuan-
aztec mythology i suddenly threw down
pencil and paper and commenced to
chant

  ia ia tloquenahuaque thou who
art all in thyself thou too ipalne-
moan by whom we live i hear i hear
i see i see serpent-bearing eagle hail
a message a message huitzilopotchli
in my soul echoes thy thunder

  at my intonations the maniac stared
incredulously through his odd mask his
handsome face shown in a surprize and
perplexity which quickly changed to
alarm his mind seemed to go blank a
moment and then to recrystallize in an-

other pattern raising his hands aloft
he chanted as if in a dream

  mictlanteuctli great lord a sign a
sign from within thy black cave ia tona-
tiuh-metztli cthulhutl command and
i serve

  now in all this responsive gibberish
there was one word which struck an odd
cord in my memory odd because it
never occurs in any printed account of
mexican mythology yet had been over-
heard by me more than once as an awe-
struck whisper amongst the peons in my
own firms tlaxcala mines it seemed
to be part of an exceedingly secret and
ancient ritual for there were character-
istic whispered responses which i had
caught now and then and which were as
unknown as itself to academic scholar-
ship this maniac must have spent con-
siderable time with the hill peons and in-
dians just as he had said for surely such
unrecorded lore could have come from no
mere book-learning realizing the im-
portance he must attach to this doubly
esoteric jargon i determined to strike at
his most vulnerable spot and give him the
gibberish responses the natives used

  ya-rlyeh ya-rlyeh i shouted
cthulhutl fhtaghn niguratl-yig yog-
sototl-

  but i never had a chance to finish gal-
vanized into a religious epilepsy by the
exact response which his subconscious
mind had probably not really expected
the madman scrambled down to a kneel-
ing posture on the floor bowing his wire-
helmeted head again and again and turn-
ing it to right and left as he did so
with each turn his obeisances became
more profound and i could hear his foam-
ing lips repeating the syllable kill kill
kill in a rapidly swelling monotone it
occurred to me that i had overreached


weird tales

myself and that my response had un-
loosed a mounting mania which would
rouse him to the slaying-point before the
train reached the station

  as the arc of the madmans turnings
gradually increased the slack in the cord
from his headpiece to the battery had nat-
urally been taken up more and more now
in an all-forgetting delirium of ecstasy he
began to magnify his turns to complete
circles so that the cord wound round his
neck and began to tug at its moorings to
the battery on the seat i wondered what
he would do when the inevitable would
happen and the battery would be dragged
to presumable destruction on the floor

  then came the sudden cataclysm the
battery yanked over the seats edge by
the maniacs last gesture of orgiastic
frenzy did indeed fall but it does not
seem to have wholly broken instead as
my eye caught the spectacle in one too-
fleeting instant the actual impact was
borne by the rheostat so that the switch
was jerked over instantly to full current
and the marvelous thing is that there
was a current the invention was no
mere dream of insanity

  i saw a blinding blue auroral corusca-
tion heard an ululating shriek more
hideous than any of the previous cries of
that mad horrible journey and smelled
the nauseous odor of burning flesh that
was all my overwrought consciousness
could bear and i sank instantly into ob-
livion

when the train guard at mexico
city revived me i found a crowd
on the station platform around my com-
partment door at my involuntary cry the
pressing faces became curious and dubious
and i was glad when the guard shut out
ftll but thetrim doctorwhohad pushed his

way through to me my cry was a very
natural thing but it had been prompted
by something more than the shocking
sight on the carriage floor which i had
expected to see or i should say by
something less because in truth there was
not anything on the floor at all

  nor said the guard had there been
when he opened the door and found me
unconscious within my ticket was the
only one sold for that compartment and
i was the only person found within it
just myself and my valise nothing more

i had been alone all the way from quere-
taro guard doctor and spectators alike
tapped their foreheads significantly at my
frantic and insistent questions

  had it all been a dream or was i in-
deed mad i recalled my anxiety and
overwrought nerves and shuddered
thanking the guard and doctor and
shaking free of the curious crowd i stag-
gered into a cab and was taken to the
fonda nacional where after telegraph-
ing jackson at the mine i slept till after-
noon in an effort to get a fresh grip on
myself i had myself called at one
oclock in time to catch the narrow-gage
for the mining country but when i got
up i found a telegram under the door
it was from jackson and said that feldon
had been found dead in the mountains
that morning the news reaching the mine
about ten oclock the papers were all
safe and the san francisco office had been
duly notified so the whole trip with its
nervous haste and harrowing mental or-
deal had been for nothing

  knowing that mccomb would expect
a personal report despite the course of
events i sent another wire ahead and took
the narrow-gage after all four hours
later i was rattled and jolted into the sta
tion of mine no  where jackson was
the electric executioner



waiting to give a cordial greeting he was
so full of the affair at the mine that he did
not notice my still shaken and seedy ap-
pearance

  the superintendents story was brief and
he told me it as he led me toward the shack
up the hillside above the arrastre where
feldons body lay feldon he said had
always been a queer sullen character ever
since he was hired the year before working
at some secret mechanical device and com-
plaining of constant espionage and being
disgustingly familiar with the native work-
men but he certainly knew the work the
country and the people he used to make
long trips into the hills where the peons
lived and even to take part in some of their
ancient heathenish ceremonies he hinted
at odd secrets and strange powers as often
as he boasted of his mechanical skill of
late he had disintegrated rapidly growing
morbidly suspicious of his colleagues and
undoubtedly joining his native friends in
ore-thieving after his cash got low he
needed unholy amounts of money for
something or other-was always having
boxes come from laboratories and machine
shops in mexico city or the states

  as for the final absconding with all the
papers-it was only a crazy gesture of re-
venge for what he called spying he was
certainly stark mad for he had gone
across country to a hidden cave on the
wild slope of the haunted sierra de ma-
linche where no white men live and had
done some amazingly queer things the
cave which would never have been found
but for the final tragedy was full of hid-
eous old aztec idols and altars the latter
covered with the charred bones of recent
burnt-offerings of doubtful nature the
natives would tell nothing-indeed they
swore they knew nothing-but it was

easy to see that the cave was an old rendez-
vous of theirs and that feldon had shared
their practices to the fullest extent

  the searchers had found the place only
because of the chanting and the final cry it
had been close to five that morning and
after an all-night encampment the party
had begun to pack up for its empty-handed
return to the mines then somebody had
heard faint rhythms in the distance and
knew that one of the noxious old native rit-
uals was being howled from some lonely
spot up the slope of the corpse-shaped
mountain they heard the same old
names-mictlanteuctli tonatiuh-metzli
cthulhutl ya-rlyeh and all the rest-but
the queer thing was that some english
words were mixed with them real white
mans english and no greaser patter
guided by the sound they had hastened up
the weed-entangled mountainside toward
it when after a spell of quiet the shriek had
burst upon them it was a terrible thing-a
worse thing than any of them had ever
heard before there seemed to be some
smoke too and a morbid acrid smell

  then they stumbled on the cave its en-
trance screened by scrub mesquites but
now emitting clouds of foetid smoke it was
lighted within the horrible altars and gro-
tesque images revealed flickeringly by can-
dles which must have been changed less
than a half-hour before and on the gravelly
floor lay the horror that made all the crowd
reel backward it was feldon head burned
to a crisp by some odd device he had
slipped over it-a kind of wire cage con-
nected with a rather shaken-up battery
which had evidently fallen to the floor from
a nearby altar-pot when the men saw it
they exchanged glances thinking of the
electric executioner feldon had always
boasted of inventing-the thing which


weird tales

everyone had rejected but had tried to steal
and copy the papers were safe in feldons
open portmanteau which stood close by
and an hour later the column of searchers
started back for no  with a grisly burden
on an improvised stretcher

  that was all but it was enough to make
me turn pale and falter as jackson led me
up past the arrastre to the shed where he
said the body lay for i was not without
imagination and knew only too well into
what hellish nightmare this tragedy some-
how supernaturally dovetailed i knew
what i should see inside that gaping door
around which the curious miners clus-
tered and did not flinch when my eyes
took in the giant form the rough corduroy
clothes the oddly delicate hands the
wisps of burnt beard and the hellish ma-
chine itself-battery slightly broken and
headpiece blackened by the charring of
what was inside the great bulging port-
manteau did not surprise me and i
quailed only at two things-the folded
sheets of paper sticking out of the
left-hand pocket and the queer sagging of
the corresponding right-hand pocket in a
moment when no one was looking i
reached out and seized the too familiar
sheets crushing them in my hand without
daring to look at their penmanship i
ought to be sorry now that a kind of panic
fear made me burn them that night with
averted eyes they would have been a pos-
itive proof or disproof of something-but
for that matter i could still have had proof
by asking about the revolver the coroner
afterward took from that sagging
right-hand coat pocket i never had the
courage to ask about that-because my
own revolver was missing after the night
on the train my pocket pencil too
shewed signs of a crude and hasty

sharpening unlike the precise pointing i
had given it friday afternoon on the ma-
chine in president mccombs private car
so in the end i went home still puz-
zled-mercifully puzzled perhaps the
private car was repaired when i got back to
queretaro but my greatest relief was cross-
ing the rio grande into el paso and the
states by the next friday i was in san
francisco again and the postponed wed-
ding came off the following week

 as to what really happened that
night-as ive said i simply dont dare to
speculate that chap feldon was insane to
start with and on top of his insanity he had
piled a lot of prehistoric aztec witch-lore
that nobody has any right to know he was
really an inventive genius and that battery
must have been the genuine stuff i heard
later how he had been brushed aside in
former years by press public and poten-
tates alike too much disappointment isnt
good for men of a certain kind anyhow
some unholy combination of influences
was at work he had really by the way
been a soldier of maximilians

  when i tell my story most people call
me a plain liar others lay it to abnormal
psychology-and heaven knows i was
overwrought-while still others talk of
astral projection of some sort my zeal
to catch feldon certainly sent my thoughts
ahead toward him and with all his indian
magic hed be about the first one to recog-
nise and meet them was he in the railway
carriage or was i in the cave on the
corpse-shaped haunted mountain what
would have happened to me had i not de-
layed him as i did ill confess i dont
know and im not sure that i want to
know ive never been in mexico
since-and as i said at the start i dont
enjoy hearing about electric executions

weird tales

  i too sensed a flaw in my uncles
hospitality when he was so annoyed
at my own unexpected appearance
upon the scene afterward quite by
accident i overheard him discussing
with his assistant anhui pilluth a
plan to dispose of you permanently
dispose of me why should he
wish to dispose of me

  for the most part to further his
insane desire for scientific knowledge
and secondarily for patriotic reasons
he considers you and your discovery
a menace to masovada if you should
be allowed to return to earth and an-
nounce the success of your voyage
and how does he plan to dispose
of me

  he has perfected an operation by
means of which he transfers the in-
telligence of one being to the physical
body of another and he plans to in-
terchange your personality witli that
of nebond a young marb which has
but recently been domesticated fur-
thermore he has set crobe another
marb to watch you and were he to
learn that you had escaped your room
he would probably become violently
angry and run amuck crobe has the
strength of many men and if he
should rim amuck he would undoubt-
edly kill you before anything could
be done tostop him

  ignoring her reference to crobe
kiser asked just what would it
mean to me if he performed such an
operation   

  it would mean that your mind and
your intelligence would occupy the
body of nebond the marb nebond
will possess your body and you his
you will have your own memory
your own mentality-inasmuch as it
can function through the brain of a
marb which you will have in place of
your own

  of course you will be unable to
use the brain of a marb as you would
use your own the brute will be able
to use yours better than he did his
own once he gets accustomed to it
will do things which you would loathe

to see your physical body do and eat
things at which you would rebel if you
knew he will reason only as a marb
or slightly better due to the fact that
he has a human brain at his dis-
posal

  i am indeed grateful to you de-
lam oblene for having warned me i
shall take french leave of kabo and
let him look elsewhere for his experi-
mental material

  yes you must go at once but
pray do not mention that kabo has
entertained you for should it be
known that he had done so without
reporting the matter to the legisla-
tive council he would incur the dis-
favor of all masovada it would hu-
miliate him very much and would
profit you nothing

  but how was he to communicate
with the authorities so soon

  he has but to attune his mind to
a certain vibration to send his
thoughts wheresoever he wills

  ah telepathy

  no not telepathy in the masova-
dan brain there is a concentration
center and in the nostrils of the ma-
sovadan there are certain cells sensi-
tized to receive all thought vibration
which is attuned in harmony with
them thus we are able to project our
thoughts to anyone whose vibratory
rate we know and concentrate upon 
  indeed i shall say nothing of hav-
ing met with kabo but where had i
best go

  i shall conduct you by kandike
back to your craft and tomorrow i
shall provide for your being found by
the proper person please do not
judge masovadan hospitality by that
of my poor deluded uncle who would
sacrifice his honor to his mania for
scientific achievement and his desire
to solve one of the mooted questions
of the age remain well hidden here
in the shadows and i will return with
the kandike presently

  but might you not encounter
crobe upon your way to the landing-

terrace
earthworms of karma



  i have nothing to fear from crobe
so long as he doesnt suspect that you
have escaped him i shall-

  just what she had intended to say
kiser never knew for just at that mo-
ment there was a coarse growl behind
them and turning suddenly they
stood face to face with the giant
crobe his eyes protruding to the ex-
treme limit of their telescoping ped-
icles and glowing ominously his huge
teeth bared like those of an angry
dog and his whole attitude threaten-
ing as he stood poised as though ready
to spring forward and annihilate
everything in his path

  true to delam oblenes prediction
crobe had flown into a rage at sight
of the earthman in the garden he
growled and stamped his foot in
anger and as kiser watched he saw
white froth appear upon his lips

  delam oblene addressed the beast
in the strange musical language of
the martians her tone was emphatic
and she pointed toward the house but
the marb appeared not to have heard
v she stepped forward and repeated
her command with yet more emphasis
but by this time the beast was in a
frenzy of rage and as she approached
him he stooped and snapped vicious-
ly barely missing her outstretched
hand

  then it was that delam oblene did
a very earth-like feminine thing she
sprang back with a scream - and
fainted

  knowing his own superior strength
kiser had first planned merely to
evade the beast and hold his attention
until delam oblene should have had
time to get her kandike and return
but when he saw the enraged animal
attempt violence to the girl he
changed his plan-or rather the plan
changed itself and he leapt forward
covering the distance between them at
a single bound striking with all his
strength behind the blow he landed
squarely upon the receding chin of
his antagonist just as the beast bent
his long neck forward to resume the

quarrel at the point where delam
oblene had interrupted it

  there was a loud snap like the
crack of a whip and crobe was flung
far backward to land upon his shoul-
ders limp and inert his neck broken
and his face crushed as though he had
been struck by a ten-ton truck ki-
sers blow had been delivered with
all the strength of muscles developed
upon a planet whose gravitational
pull was much greater than mars and
the maitian creatures were not so
constructed as to enable them to with-
stand such violence

  the growls of crobe aiid the girls
scrcam had aroused kabo and sud-
denly as if by magic the garden was
brilliantly illuminated showing crobe
lying mangled and dead and kiser
kneeling beside the prostrate form of
delam oblene

  a nice guest you are indeed
said kabo with biting sarcasm

  kiser turned his head slightly to
face kabo but did not rise he was
unwilling to accuse the martian of
the perfidy which the girl had attrib-
uted to him and thus betray that she
had warned him

  no harm meant i assure you he
said i strolled out into the garden
to enjoy the moonlight and your niece
followed me here to warn me about
some supposed danger from crobe
true to her fears he attacked me and
i fear that i have killed him for
which i am very sorry it seems that
i am much stronger upon mars than

i	was upon earth

  a pretty story indeed snarled
kabo you earthworm is there
yet no decency upon your filthy
planet i shall not await the morrow
to settle with you

  kiser rose hastily and started to
voice an angry protest when le no-
ticed for the first time a small box
which kabo carried under his arm
could this be a weapon as he
opened his mouth to speak his tongue
was very thick his knees sagged his
vision blurred and there seemed a

	transformation

joseph kiseb awoke with a feeling
of intense drowsiness his lids
seemed heavy and he was unable to
see well or control the direction of his
vision for some moments after he had
succeeded in opening his eyes

  at length he glanced about him a
white-uniformed nurse sat beside the
bed upon which he lay and he tried to
speak to her but his tongue was thick
and the best he did was an unintel-
ligible grunt

  his mouth seemed much too large
and he controlled his facial muscles
with difficulty when he attempted
to raise a hand to his face he noted
with avonder that he was in a strait-
jaeket and his wrists were lean and
hairy

  again he essayed to speak to the
nurse but his tone startled him into
silence for it was coarse and rasping
like the growl of an animal and he
was quite unable to control his tone
or inflection

  where am i he asked at last in
a voice that was utterly unrecogniz-
able

  the nurse gave him a perplexed
stare she spoke some words in the
martian tongue and kiser thought she
appeared to be somewhat mystified at
this patient who appeared to be fully
awake and yet who had attempted to
converse in an altogether unintel-
ligible tongue she pushed a button
which was fastened upon the wall and
after a lapse of some moments kabo
stepped into the room

  at sight of kabo the memory of
the experience of the last evening
came vaguely back into kisers mind
he remembered his stroll about
kabos gardens his being warned of
some seemingly remote danger by a
wonderful martian girl his fight with

crobe-but why was he thus invalid-
ed and bound what has happened
to me he roared in his strange
gruff voice turning his head the bet-
ter to see the martian for although
it may have been mere fancy begot of
his recent surroundings his eyes
seemed to be protruding telescoping
and unwieldy

  there was a triumphant gleam in
kabos eye and kiser went cold as
he suddenly recalled the text of de-
lam oblenes warning and the mar-
tians threat just as he had lost con-
sciousness this together with the
recollection of the appearance of his
arm upon awakening sent a thrill of
intense horror through him and he
strove with desperation to loosen the
thongs which held his wrists

  you must lie still remarked
kabo calmly although his tone was
not unkind above all things you
must not worry and struggle like
this you may do yourself great in-
jury if you continue to do so

  kiser calmed himself with an ef-
fort did you carry out your das-
tardly design upon me  did you
exchange my physical body for that
of a beast as you planned

  kabo showed his surprize how
did you happen to suspect that i
might have had designs upon you
he asked

  when kiser did not answer but be-
gan again to pull and tug frantically
in another effort to free himself the
martian gave some instructions to the
nurse who at once administered a
hypodermic

  you must desist in your efforts to
free yourself lest you injure your
chance of recovery i shall see you
again when you are stronger with
this kabo turned and left the room

kiser saw no more of kabo for
several days saw no one in
fact except the nurse and he was un-
able to converse with her but since
his talk with the martian he had been
kept under the influence of some
earthworms of karma



powerful narcotie either in a deep
sleep or so benumbed that he took no j
interest in himself or his surround- 
ings

  just how long he was kept under
the influence of drugs kiser never
knew but it must have been for sev-
eral days for when again he gained
control of his sensibilities most of his
soreness was gone and he had re-
gained his strength to a marked de-
gree he could pull and wrench at
the straps which bound him without
pain or discomfort but he could not
break them for some moments he
strove desperately to free himself
and when quite exhausted he turned
his head to look for the nurse she
had left the room but in his efforts
he had uncovered his chest and he
noted with horror that it was not his
own chest at all instead it was
very broad and sloped upward at a
grotesque and unsightly angle and
was thickly covered with long red-
dish-black hair

  then it was that realization of the
truth came to him kabo had ex-
changed his intelligence for that of a
huge marb here was he his soul
his intelligence his individuality oc-
cupying the physical body of a filthy
beast

  stunned and horrified by the real-
ization of this terrible truth he
ground his huge strong teeth in im-
potent rage he longed to strike
kabo just such a blow as he had
struck crobe he could picture the
large but comparatively frail martian
crumpling before the force of his
mighty muscles and he strove with
renewed energy to free himself sure-
ly no martian bond could hold him
him whose mighty blow had crushed
in the skull of a marb but alas-
and the thought came to him with
sickening horror--he no longer pos-
sessed the sinews of an earthman
physically he was a marb although
he possessed the mentality of a man
was ever any poor creature treated
with such fearful injustice his 
w t-

  mind writhed in an agony of wrath
  and he struggled with desperation at
   the bonds which held his wrists and
  ankles they held but surely they
  could not withstand such violence for
  long some day they would break
  and then he would rend kabo limb
  from limb this was such an excep-
  tional case as to make murder a vir-
  tue and kiser raged on tugging
  wrenching snarling and foaming at
  the mouth until forced to desist from
  sheer exhaustion

    the nurse re-entered the room and
  at sight of her he again flew into a
  convulsive rage swearing biting and
  struggling against the straitjacket
  the nurse drew back in fright but
  secured a long pointed strap from
  her handbag and approaching the bed
  struck kiser a stinging lash across
  his thighs

    surprized and outraged kiser de-
  sisted for the moment to stare with
  wonder and resentment at the mai-
  tian girl apparently she was not
  overjoyed at being special nurse to a
  marb and she intended to enforce a
  certain degree of discipline even if it
  required coercive measures to do so
  evidently she had been chosen for
  this duty because she did not speak
  english and undoubtedly she was
  ignorant of the fact that the creature
  before her was other than the beastly
  marb he appeared to be

    she seemed more frightened than
  relieved however at the expression
  in kisers eye as he looked at her now
  and running quickly across the room
  she again pushed the button with
  which she had previously summoned
  kabo

    at sight of his malefactor as he
  entered the room accompanied by his
  assistant anhui pilluth kiser was
  so overcome with rage that he could
  not speak for a moment he lay and
  glared with intense hatred at the two
  of them and then with all his
  strength he pulled and twisted at the
  restraining straitjacket the leather-
  like straps creaked and stretched un-


weird tales

  der his efforts but they held fast at
length he recovered his voice and
hurled at kabo a most violent impre-
cation stating in no uncertain terms
just what he intended to do when he
should succeed in making liis escape

  you certainly have worked your-
self up to a most frightful amuck
said kabo calmly after he had dis-
missed the nurse the marb brain
and the earthly temperament work
beautifully together i see to say
nothing of the beautiful body i have
given you a wonderful improvement
over your former self i call it go
ahead and struggle if you must you
could not release yourself in a dozen
years and it will do you no harm now

i	am sure it would be useless to tell
you to desist for you are now
equipped with the brain of a marb
and you will find it more difficult to
control yourself than formerly if
that is possible  

  you are a liar i have my own
brain although you devils have given
me a marbs body  

 oh no you have nebonds
brain only the pineal glands and
a portion of the solar plexus were
transplanted it was your mind
which i interchanged not your
brains the brain is but the medium
of contact of the mind with the phys-
ical body the more important seat
of the ego or consciousness is in the
solar plexus through which functions
the so-called subconscious mind by
means of the pineal body we are en- i
abled to remember past events but 
we recall them through the function-
ing of the physical brain therefore i
transferred that organ so that you
could remember your past rather
than that of nebond as would have
been the case had t not done this in-
terchange  

  you are a fiend what right
have you to tamper with my soul or
that of the beast if he lias one i j
came here from another planet and
you take me in under the pretense of
hospitality merely to take advantage

i

  of my confidence to perpetrate upon
  me a crime ten thousand times more
  heinous than murder you intro-
  duced me into a world in which you
  say crime has been abolished and at
  that very moment you were formu-
  lating a crime unprecedented in its
  horror what do you hope to gain
  by this what benefit can you or
  your planet possibly derive from such
  a gruesome experiment as this
  alas what you say is only too
  true and i regret very much to have
  betrayed your confidence but the
  end justifies the means i have sac-
  rificed you to science and you should
  feel honored i owe you an apology
  however for having misjudged your
  motive with reference to my niece
  you owe me far more than an
  apology what has happened to my
  body the marb who possesses my
  body had better be guarded carefully
  for i shall hold you responsible for
  any mishap which may occur to him
  and in any way injure my physical
  body  

   why should you worry about
  what may or may not happen to that
  which was yours but is now the body
  of a marb the body which you
  have here is now yours the other one
  is his

     kiser was fast losing control of his
  temper   i shall not suffer this state
  to continue you have had your ex-
  periment at my expense and now i
  demand that you restore me to my
  rightful body

and destroy an experiment of
 which i have dreamed all of my life

  hardly surely earthman you do
   not consider your puny little physical
  body of more importance than the
  i scientific knowledge to be derived
  from the furtherance of this experi-
  ment i was not surprized that the
  marl objected to the thing and by
  the way he was even more bitter than
  you when he awoke and learned tho
  truth his lamentations were most ter-
  rible to behold he has been kept
  under the influence of the strotan
earthworms of karma



ray until the present because we
have no strait jacket strong enough to
hold him perhaps in my old age
when i have watched the progress of
the experiment to my hearts content
i shall restore you to your earth
form if you can sustain yourself and
if nebond can sustain your earth-
body for that long at present how-
ever i shall make no such change i
have started and i shall see this in-
teresting experiment through to the
end however wicked you may think
me for so doing

  you are not only a scoundrel but
a coward roared kiser in a rage
if you do not undo this thing you
have done to me neither you nor i
will live to be old you may rest as-
sured of that 	

  anhui pilluth had stood all the
while his face expressionless appar-
ently desiring to take no further part
in the tragic drama which was being
enacted at the expense of the earth-
ling kiser imagined that he saw the
stamp of disapproval at the jeering re-
marks of kabo as he watched the
face of the younger martian but he
could not be certain

 pilluth was a much larger man
than kabo and his face was very in-
tellectual if an earthling might
judge rightly his eyes seemed milder
and less domineering than kabos
and kiser involuntarily wondered if
this man did not already regret his
part in the ghastly affair

  nothing would please me more
said kiser as the two martians left
the room than to see your assistant
who appears much more intelligent
than you-than to watch him while he
transfers your soul to the body of-
of an earthworm 

  he felt however that nothing
could be more wasted than efforts to
taunt kabo he appeared to have no
resentment no emotion whatsoever
but his insatiable desire to perfect his
scientific supremacy and-oh yes his
hatred of earth and all things earthly

kiser regretted his hasty remark
which had betrayed the fact that
he foreknew kabos intentions with
regard to him lest it might have
caused him to suspect delam oblenea
real mission in the garden for he felt
that otherwise kabo was ignorant of
the fact that his niece knew of his
plans or suspected the fate to which
he had subjected the earthling

  if only delam oblene might find
him her influence might be brought to
bear upon kabo and prevail upon him
to right the wrong he had done

  he wondered what had become of
his sweetheart and her father but
dared not inquire of them to kabo for
fear that the martian might subject
them also to a fate like his own if
only he might escape and go to them
but no he could not bear the thought
of ruths seeing him in this state
perhaps she was even now awaiting
his return in an agony of suspense
wondering hoping praying yet not
dreaming the dreadful fate that had
befallen him

 and yet it must be remembered
that kisers intelligence was function-
ing through the sluggish brain of ne-
bond the marb and therefore he was
incapable of the extremes of emotion
which he might have suffered had he
had a human brain that is probably
the reason that the next few weeks of
mental anguish humiliation and de-
spair did not drive him mad

  had delam oblene forgotten her
promise or had kabo told her that
kiser had escaped and returned to
earth perhaps she suspected the
fate that had befallen him but had
been unable to find him for some
twenty days now he had not seen
kabo and all of this time he had lain
bound as he had found himself upon
awakening but he managed to exer-
cise his muscles somewhat each day
the nurse had left him now and only
came to bring his meals and feed him
twice each day

  one evening just at twilight the
door of his room opened softly and


weird tales

someone entered thinking it was the
nurse returning to perform some un-
finished duty kiser did not turn for
some moments but when after a
time he heard no further sound he
opened his eyes suddenly to see delam
oblene gazing sorrowfully down upon
him at first the sight of the martian
girl caused him a distinct thrill of
hopeful joy but this was immediately
supplanted by a sense of shame that
she should behold the grotesqueness
of his appearance and witness the
evidence of his complete defeat at the
hands of kabo

  oh i am so sorry whispered
delam oblene her voiee trembling
with emotion her eyes tearful and
sympathetic this is a terrible out-
rage  i shall demand that you be lib-
erated at once if the council should
learn of this outrage kabo would be
severely punished he will not dare
defy me

  i can not express delam oblene
how glad i am to see you faltered
iciser for days and days you have
been the only ray of hope that i have
dared hold on to but beware do not
put yourself in kabos power he is
the vilest demon in the universe he
will stop at nothing and it is unsafe
to threaten him he does not know
that you are aware of his perfidy
would it not be safer to go at once to
the council with the news of his crime
than to risk an argument with him
heaven knows what he might do to
you if you antagonize him

  oh no that would not be fair we
must give him a chance he will not
harm me  such things are not done
upon mars he would not have dared
to injure you had he known that there
were others in your party just now
they are making exhaustive search
for you and kabo is greatly worried
he told me that crobe injured you
very severely in the garden and that
he feared your reason might be per-
manently impaired when you recov-
ered but enjoined me to say nothing 
about your having been here lest we

be blamed for allowing harm to come
to you i do not know what dispo-
sition he intends to make of your
body but i rather fear he intends to
kill nebond so that your body may be
found and accounted for as soon as
the scars of the operation have disap-
peared under his treatment that is
in his judgment necessary since i
chanced to see you which was con-
trary to his plans to kill nebond
you see would not be murder forne-
bond is only a marb had i not acci-
dentally come upon the two of you in
the garden archway and had there
not been others from earth to tell of
your disappearance kabo could have
kept both bodies and observed the re-
sults of ms art to ms heart s content
but my friends - what of them
are they safe are they not in
kabos power

  they are quite safe they are the
guests of frambrozo himnun whose
father in his earth life was none
other than your own benjamin
franklin  

  thank heaven for that i have
been in an agony of suspense for
them but what do you mean by his
earth life have others come from
earth to mars

  in spirit only your party is the
only exception do you not remem-
ber what was told you regarding the
reincarnation upon masovada  
yes indeed i remember clearly
now but my marb brain functions
but slowly

  i must not tarry longer i shall
go at once to kabo and demand that
you be released from your horrible
predicament

  whatever else you may do delam
oblene be careful why not go away
and broadcast your challenge to him
from a distance is there not some
way in which you may insure your-
self against harm

  i do not fear my uncle i shall
go to him in person with my ultima-
tum there is naught to fear  s
earthworms of karma



less than ah hour after delam ob-
lene had taken her leave kabo en-
tered kisers room under his arm
was that same instrument he had used
so effectually upon that memorable
night in the garden and upon his lips
was a smile that might have meant
menace or chagrin

  it is unfortunate he said that
in our stroll about my garden on the
evening of your arrival we chanced to
meet my niece and still more unfor-
tunate that she chanced to overhear
the discussion of our plans

  kiser attempted to smile but as the
mouth of a marb is not made to ac-
commodate the effort to smile it is to
be feared that the thing he really did
was to grimace horribly

  i can not understand he said
how you are able to construe that as
a misfortune delam oblene has de-
manded my release at your hands and
you dare not refuse that demand for
obvious reasons

  remarkable reasoning that and
with the brain of a marb too well it
is most unfortunate from her stand-
point she shall be punished for her
insubordination and my experiment
shall proceed as i have planned it i
shall not desist until i shall have
mated you with a female marb and
made the necessary observations re-
garding the mentality of the off-
spring  

  then your experiment will fail
roared kiser in a rage whatever
you may do to my body my soul is
that of a man and a gentleman i
will remain as i am forever rather
than consort with beasts

  he strained again at the thongs
whieh bound him to the bed if only
one of them would yield he could
quickly free himself and then he would
avenge himself upon this demon in a
very gratifying manner he felt his
face go hot and he knew that it had
attained that fiery red which he had
twice seen in a marb running amuck
he continued to struggle until his

reason began to return when he gave
up the effort and lay quite still

  kabo smiled approvingly won-
derful self-control for a marb you
can run amuck and recover your rea-
son rather more quickly than the aver-
age marb now i must move you i
shall give you only enough of the ray
to benumb your senses for you must
walk and do my bidding it would be
far too difficult to move you other-
wise for now i must work alone

  there was a slight buzzing sound
as the tiny motor of the strotan ray
machine was started and kiser expe-
rienced the same sensation as that
which had overcome-him in kabos
garden there was a whirring and
buzzing in his ears and he seemed to
be traveling through space until at
length he found himself standing up-
right clinging for support to an ill-
kept suspended bed in an almost bar-
ren room with one barred window
and a stone floor

  beyond the window and well out of
his reach stood kabo and upon the
wall just a few inches from the open-
ing-the window had no glass-was a
large mirror one glance at the re-
flection of himself in this mirror and
kiser uttered a cry of horror for
weeks he had known he had the phys-
ical body of a marb but when he saw
his reflection in the mirror the horror
of the situation struck him with such
force that he was terrified by the
gravity of his fearful predicament
he stared impotently at his reflection
and then with a scream of anguish
flung himself against the bars in an
effort to reach his malefactor these
bars were very strong however and
he only received several cuts and
bruises for his trouble

  recoiling from the rebound impe-
tus given him by his contact with the
barred window he staggered back a
few paces but recovered his equilib-
rium and advanced upon his enemy
again when he chanced to see upon one
of the panels a long wriggling ver-
min which he had injured it looked
weird tales

yr all the world like an earthworm
l td having a natural loathing for
fweh things kiser stopped short de-
sisting in his efforts to reach his
tiemv rather than touch it again

 cabo laughed oh you need not
mdder at such creatures as that it
i the lowest form of animal life we
lave upon masovada but at that he
ioesnt have as far to go to reach

jet go to reach perfection he isnt
 far behind you as you might fancy
kit if your friend nebond should
-eianee to see him he would eat him

	nebond

for some weeks nebond had been
allowed the freedom of a small
 ell-constructed enclosure in the een-
iral and isolated portion of kabos
tstate no one except the scientist
limself ever went near this part of
the grounds as the privacy he had
ilways maintained was respected by
ill and there was little likelihood that
ius part of the estate would be tres-
passed upon

 nebond did not know what had
teen done to him-he had been hor-
ribly mistreated his beautiful and
wapely body had been transformed
iito this grotesque white naked slen-
ier one perhaps he had been very
kck during the time which he so
tuguely remembered during which
la ho had ministered to him for his
matures were fearfully distorted and
its eyes drawn back into his forehead
md fixed there when he viewed
limself in the water basin which kabo
i d provided for him inside the hovel

  here lie slept he would fly into a
itge and pound himself violently
tjon the chest with growling lamen-
tations

 gradually however he became
mewhat reconciled to this objection-
tble state of affairs but his enforced
iitude was making him very ill-
ifeaapered he was becoming a cross

lazy slothful marb-a marb with the
physical body of an earth-being but
a marb nevertheless

  one day quite by accident nebond
discovered that he possessed far
greater physical strength than he had
formerly had inside the enclosure
where he was imprisoned grew a small
tree perhaps three inches in diameter
at the ground and about three feet
tall and this he chanced to grapple
with while at the height of one of his
frenzied outbursts and to his sur-
prize and delight it came up by the
roots

  the muscles of joseph kiser devel-
oped upon earth where much more
physical strength is necessary than
upon mars had potentialities little
dreamed of by their erstwhile owner
and having received this hint of his
unsuspected prowess he next tackled
the hydrant which likewise yielded
to his efforts and came away from its
anchorage with resultant inundation

  with his scant clothing thoroughly
wet and his efforts to stop the flow of
water unsuccessful nebonds mild
frenzy became a raging amuck and in
utter abandon he flung himself
against the wall of his enclosure
crushing it as though it were an egg-
shell and the infuriated marb
stepped out-free

  thus encouraged he proceeded to
vent his wrath upon everything with-
in his reach the walls about the
grounds he laid low uprooting other
small trees and shrubbery destroying
the stalls or enclosures for protection
of many of the other animals and
striking boldly out at length across
the suburban district of sendos de-
stroying everything which would
yield to his strength until he came to
the canal there his frenzy of rage
passed off quite as suddenly as it had
appeared and here he was discovered
by himnuu ruth and professor
hervy

  vaguely and without a great deal
of interest nebond wondered who
these creatures were and why they
earthworms of karma

t

had approached him perhaps they
were representatives of the council
coming to reckon with him for his
recent dreadful amuck  should he sub-
mit to the authorities as he had always
done heretofore  no there was a spark
of something in him now that bade him
defy the authorities now that his
amuck was ended he would not harm
them unless they attempted to harm
him but if they did that-well they
would have to take the consequences

  the three creatures had drawn
nearer now and were conversing in
some strange dialect they seemed to
be addressing him-but no perhaps
not for he could not understand
them he noted casually that two of
them were horrid hollow-eyed beings
like himself and yes-he was quite
certain now that they were address-
ing him but what eould they be say-
ing

  he condescended now to give them
some of his coveted attention he
saw or sensed that the smaller of the
three was a girl ah kabo had
promised him a mate perhaps this
was the one he would have much
preferred one such as he had had in
the forest beforehis capture but this
one had features like his own as re-
flected in the drinking-bowl inside his
hovel and perhaps kabo had cap-
tured her for him at any rate there
was no other to be had and this one
would do

  nebond was convinced of the truth
of his surmise when the girl ap-
proached him without fear and began
stroking his hand caressingly al-
though he could understand no word
of what she was saying perhaps
she was even now begging to be al-
lowed to accompany him back to his
hovel

  ruth was somewhat frightened
when this mad creature snatched her 
up in his arms and ran away from the 
spot but even yet she could not bring 
herself to believe that joseph kiser j
would harm her for several years
she had known and trusted him she

 recalled his gentleness his gallantry
his great love for her and although
she realized that he was now quite
mad she could not associate him with
any degree of villainy despite the
evidence to the contrary she talked
to him pleaded with him begged
him to answer and say that he
had not forgotten her-little realiz-
ing that this the physical body of her
lover now housed the soul of a vile
and savage beast whose physical
brain though in itself a human brain
could no more respond to kisers love
for her than that of a dead person
can respond

  the comparatively flight martian
gravitation offered but little antagon-
ism to the creatures earth-developed
sinews and soon they arrived at
kabos garden here nebond stopped
short - his hovel and the enclosure
which enc-ireled it were demolished
nebond had forgotten that he had
destroyed these walls which had held
him prisoner and now that he was
returning with a mate for himself
there was no place for him to take
her

 he stood ruth upon the ground
and stood for a moment viewing the
ruins all about him what was he to
do should he attempt to rebuild
 the hovel  oh no he would not do
 that should he dare to defy the
i authorities and return to the forest
i from which he had been taken yes
perhaps he should but just here his
i planning was interrupted by the
sight of food-and nebond was hun-
gry

  ruth smiled bravely up at him
joseph deal why did you take me
from my friends why oh why do
j you not speak to me joseph then
l she uttered a scream of horror and
fell in a dead faint for even as she
spoke nebond had reached far up-
ward seized a long wriggling vermin
between his fingers and was eating it
before her eyes

  nebond surveyed the still form of
the girl without interest when he

finished his scant repast he picked
her up again none too gently and
bolted away toward the canal in-
stinctively bound for the forest where
he had been captured some months
previously

	transported

for many days joseph kiser had
resided in one of the several
small hovels which stood in the cen-
tral isolated portion of kabos estate
his mind a maze of agonizing doubt
regarding the probable fate of delam
oblene and his hope of deliverance
at her hands dwindling as day suc-
ceeded day and began to number
themselves as weeks and yet there
came no evidence of the success of her
intervention in his behalf

  one morning he awoke with a feel-
ing of intense drowsiness beguiling
him to further slumber a groan
however from somewhere near caused
him to open his eyes listlessly expect-
ing to see the roof and four walls of
his hut but he was surprized into full
wakefulness as a vision of clean blue
sky met his gaze it was not the
murky almost black martian sky and
his first thought was that all of those
harrowing martian experiences had
been but dreams and that he was yet
upon the earth but one glance at
his own hairy huge-chested body suf-
ficed to quell this suspicion and then
came the groan again

  he looked about him to discern the
source of this noise and was elated to
find himself lying upon the ground
amidst a rather dense growth of shrub-
bery which waved gently with the mo-
tion of the damp heavy rather oppres-
sive atmosphere

  attempting to spring to his feet he
was surprized to find that his limbs
were numb and sluggish and his body
seemed very heavy as though a great
weight were tied about his waist

  he arose with some difficulty there
was that characteristic ringing in his
ears which revealed the fact that once

again the strotan ray had been em-
ployed to subdue his consciousness
and the atmosphere seemed-almost as
though it would strangle or even
drown him his head swam the scen-
ery spun around and he clutched for
support at a tall bush

  when he had secured a firm hold
all his giddiness suddenly left him
and he emitted a cry of agony as there
shot through the hand with wrhich he
held the bush a paroxysm of pain he
quickly released his hold and stag-
gered backward then recovered his
equilibrium and stood for some mo-
ments silently regarding his aching
palm the weed which he had clutched
appeared innocent enough being some
four feet tall with a stalk about three
inches thick at the ground where it
was pink but gradually blended into
the husky green color of the branches
and foliage the latter being a five-
pronged leaf somewhat resembling
the human hand and as it waved in
the gentle breeze it seemed to beckon
with mock hospitality

  again came the groan he had heard
before and turning quickly he be-
held the inert bulk of another huge
marb lying in the shrubbery behind
him and only about ten paces distant

  standing there aghast his mind but
barely recovered from the effect of
the strotan ray with which he had
been anesthetized and transported to
this spot he wras for the moment be-
wildered  then he recalled kabos
threat to mate him with a female
marb in order to observe the manner
of offspring such a pair would beget
undoubtedly this threat had been ex-
ecuted and now he was here-where-
soever that might be-in company
with a potential mate to abide upon
some unfrequented land and prop-
agate a race of beings which would
satisfy the martians craving for
scientific observation

  kiser stood for some moments gaz-
ing in half stupefaction at the inert
animal and as he stood she began to
arouse she raised herself upon one
earthworms of karma



elbow and looked dazedly about at
sight of kiser she uttered a growl of
fear and made an effort to get upon her
feet with the evident intention of re-
treat but she lost her footing and
slumped helplessly to the ground
again

  she lay there gasping and trem-
bling her protruding eyes dilated
with fear and kiser thought that she
looked remarkably like the one he had
seen in kabos garden but that was
not strange as he had seen but one
female marb-she might even be the
same and perhaps she feared him be-
cause he had slain her mate if indeed
she had intelligence enough to know
so much

  at any rate she was only a female
marb and he was not interested in any
further speculation regarding her so
he turned about at once and walked
deliberately away

  for some distance he went through
shrubbery such as that amongst which
he had awakened then he came sud-
denly to the border of a dense forest
the trees of which were very large
and grew somewhat higher than those
in the forest east of keto the fo-
liage too was not nearly so large
although somewhat larger than any
he had seen upon the earth

  kiser wondered what remote part
of mars this could be where the vege-
tation was so luxuriant and the at-
mosphere so much less rare and
where as yet there had been no
evidence of a canal the planetary
magnetism too seemed much greater
than at keto for even now kiser was
quite exhausted and found it neces-
sary to stop and rest

  there was a distinct line of demar-
cation between the forest and the area
of shrubbery and kiser wondered
vaguely why that should be so there
was no evidence of there ever having
been a forest fire and yet the forest
ended abruptly where the shrubbery
began

 although kiser knew that this
could not be the forest near the city

of keto yet he felt elated at being
free and should kabo attempt to re-
turn and observe the result of his
experiment he would now be in posi-
tion to offer him a warm reception

  having rested kiser plunged on
into the forest half expecting to come
at any moment upon one of the large
martian canals he had walked per-
haps a mile when again the forest
ended almost as abruptly as it had
done pon the other side but it did
not end at the shore of a canal nor
yet another area of shrubbery but
instead there stretched out before him
a vast expanse of barren sand-covered
surface which glittered almost as
white as snow in the sunlight

  the heat hdd grown oppressive
he neared this barren area and as he
was again much fatigued he again sat
down to rest himself before ventur-
ing farther upon his tour of explo-
ration he had not noticed the hecf
before and wondered that it should be
so much more intense here than in
the depth of the forest yet the fae
remained and he found his rest so un-
refreshing that he remained longer
than previously

just as he was upon the point of
arising he saw the huge marb
whom he had left behind approac-
the sand oeean at some distance from
him she did not see him and he
deferred his advance intending to
allow her to proceed without knowl-
edge of his presenee

  she had evidently arrived before
him for she showed no evidence of
fatigue as she advanced and strode
firmly out upon the sand-covered area
apparently quite as intent as himseli
upon exploration of the land upon
which kabo had marooned them

 for ten-perhaps twenty-paces
she advanced without mishap then
she seemed to pause but thinking bet-
ter of it again went forward just
two more steps she took then stoppec
dead-still for an instant turned and
attempted to retrace her steps but


weird tales

before she could even so much as re-
gain her equilibrium she began to sink
in the loose sand about her feet she
attempted to throw herself forward
upon her face but the sand upon
which she stood seemed to sway like
the waves upon a ropy viscid fluid
with encrusted top she made re-
peated attempts to withdraw her feet
from the sand but could not do so

  seeing that she was sinking deeper
and deeper and was quite unable to
escape kiser hastened toward her
but before he had reached the spot
another creature appeared from the
depths of the forest and tossing a
long rope dexterously lassoed the
sinking marb and was pulling with all
his strength in an effort to rescue her
when kiser reached his side

  kiser caught up the end of the rope
and assisted in the towing in the task
being one which taxed the strength of
both

  the creature which had come to the
rescue of the marb was about six feet
tall walked upright like a human be-
ing and his physical build was indeed
much more human-like than that of
either of the others his legs and
arms were long and muscular and
clothed with the well-tanned skin of
some animal his skin was copper-
colored and quite bare with chest and
body shaped quite like that of an
earth-man though the face and head
were covered with long led hair which
hung down to his shoulders he had
eyes that did not protrude and a
large sneering mouth equipped with
strong yellow teeth one glance suf-
ficed to convince one that he was of
some savage human species

  so intent was he upon his duties of
rescue that he was not aware of
kisers presence behind him and when
the huge marl had been dragged to
the more solid sand nearer the edge
of the forest the creature drew a long
knife from his belt and with a savage
growl sprang toward her

  the marb evaded her rescuer with
surprizing agility but lie braced him-

self for another wh when kiser
caught his upraised hand frojn behind
and snatched the knife from his fin-
gers

  taken completely by surprize the
savage creature turned to face this
new enemy but the sight of kiser
brandishing the knife and the other
marb approaching him from the side
both much larger than and quite
as fierce-looking as himself discour-
aged his making a renewed attack al-
though had he but known it he might
easily have vanquished both and he
slunk away into the forest leaving
both knife and rope in the possession
of his enemies

  when the beast had gone the marb
backed away from kiser in evident
fear and distrust

  you need not fear me he said
forgetful that she could not under-
stand his english i shall not harm
you in the least

  when he had spoken the marb
stopped and gasped in astonishment

  joseph kiser she said as if
pronouncing the words with much
difficulty

  now it was kisers turn to be
astonished he remembered sudden-
ly that marbs can not speak any of the
earth languages-how did it happen
that this one knew his name

  yes i am joseph kiser but how
do you happen to know my name
can you speak english

  the marb answered him in the
martian tongue of which he could
understand no word he shook his
head and tried to grin but he must
have bared his teeth instead for the
creature stepped back in evident
fright

  she soon recovered herself how-
ever and seemed to be pondering she
essayed to speak several times as if
groping for words speaking each time
in the martian language although she
appeared to be trying to recall
another

  after several such attempts at
speech this creature bent upon kiser
earthworms of karma



a gaze more appealing than savage
and sjaid delam oblene

  what is that he asked his in-
terest quickening do you have a
message for me from delam oblene

  but again the marb was stumped
she appeared to be able to say only
those two things which kiser could
understand-pronounce his own name
and that of delam oblene

  of a sudden kiser understood this
was indeed juak and she was trying
to denounce him for having killed her
mate perhaps her mention of delam
oblene was to impart that that young
lady had informed her regarding the
manner of crobes death

ceeing that conversation with this
creature was impossible kiser
turned and strode back into the for-
est and when he again became ex-
hausted and stopped he noted that
the air was quite cold he had noted
ofttimes before the very marked
difference in temperature between
the martian day and night but here
was a vast difference brought about
by only a few moments walk oh
well it was useless to wonder where
kabo had marooned him for even if
he knew yet he would be none the
wiser since he knew nothing of any
part of mars save keto-and very
little of that this marked change
in temperature however puzzled him
considerably how was such a change
possible  and why had the innocent-
appearing sand proved to be a
treacherous mire

  at length his sluggish marb brain
reached the correct solution the
sand-covered area was a great lava
lake which had cooled somewhat upon
the surface and near the margin of
the forest the heat underneath caus-
ing the surface to crumble into a
sand-like powder while underneath
the surface and farther out there was
only molten liquid lava or some
similar substance this would ac-
count for the phenomenon he had

witnessed and also for the intense
heat at the forests edge

  the sun had sunk quite low and
kiser began to look about him for
some place to spend the night he
found nothing which might suffice for
a shelter and the cold was becoming
more and more noticeable so after
perhaps a half-hour of futile seareh
he retraced his steps to the margin of
the lava lake

  upon several occasions he had sur-
prized a number of small animals as
they fed which gave him a very valu-
able clue as to the edible fruits and
being hungry he ate freely of a cer-
tain variety resembling the apple

  it was quite palatable and when he
had eaten his fill he felt as much re-
freshed as though he had had beef-
steak or eggs

  darkness came with a startling
suddenness-or more coitectly the
sun disappeared quickly and without
twilight-for even after the sun had
set there was a most brilliant moon-
light

  looking upward to discover th
source of this light kiser gasped in
astonishment for directly overhead
there was an enormous satellite it
was large-much too large to be
phobus in fact it seemed many hun-
dreds of times larger than phobus
had appeared upon that memorable
night in kabos garden

  so he had been transported to
some other planet  indeed kabo had
taken no chances whatsoever upon his
victims escaping well since this
was most certainly not mars what
planet was it could he be upon
venus no for venus had no such
satellite and too he had been led to
believe that venus was shrouded in
clouds the day had been so short
that he was sure this was a very small
planet yet what planet it might be
he could not guess

  this was the most severe blow of
all upon mars he might always have
some hope for his ultimate deliver-
ance from the horrible curse which


weird tales

had been placed upon him but since
kabo had taken the precaution to
maroon him upon some other planet
the situation was hopeless indeed

  he had chosen a spot comfortably
near the lava lake where he lay down
and tried to sleep but his mind was
so filled with despair that for more
than an hour sleep did not come so
he lay staring upward in almost un-
thinking agony the enormous satel-
lite hanging mockingly directly above
him as if for no other purpose than
to remind him of his misery and
despair and directly overhead it re-
mained the sun had moved rapidly
across the horizon and yet this satel-
lite continued to hang directly over-
head

  at length the center of the immense
satellite appeared to have opened and
a broad stairway descended to within
a few feet of his outstretched hands
but yet quite beyond his reach he
sprang for it with a mighty effort
clutched the lower rung with the tips
of his fingers swayed for a moment
making herculean efforts to hold fast
and then fell

  kiser awoke with a start to find the
sun peeping from the horizon where it
had just risen he glanced quickly up-
ward and-yes there was still the
huge satellite op planet in exactly the
same position as when he had first
seen it

  since this planet had not changed
its position and remained always
directly overhead then it was clear
that the sphere upon which he stood
did not rotate upon an axis but in-
stead it revolved about that other
larger planet with always the same
surface toward the planet about
which it revolved

  thus it was that kiser reasoned he
had been marooned upon a satellite of
some one of the primary planets
and since the period of sunshine had
been but a few hours he knewr that
he must be upon phobus the larger
and rapid-moving satellite of mars

 how kabo had contrived to get

him upon phobus he did not know
perhaps he had stolen the amogant
he might easily have done so in case
the craft had been left unguarded
at any rate kiser was here and now
he must find food and some manner
of abode to protect him from the
chill of the heavy damp atmosphere
and from the ferocious beasts which
peopled the planet

  he still had the long sharp knife
which he had taken from the rescue-
man   as he had named the creature
whom he encountered at the lava
lake but the animals rope he had
left with the marb he hoped she had
had intelligence enough to make use
of it

  with this knife he began hewing
down such of the smaller forest trees
as would best suit his purpose and
fashioned them into a rude cabin
stopping the cracks with mud from a
small forest stream near by

  to complete this shelter required
many of the short days and some of
the nights during this time he had
seen nothing further of the marb nor
of the rescue-man he subsisted
upon the forest fruits and such of the
small animals as he was able to catch
the stream near his cabin furnished
an ample quantity of icy cold water
and withal he was near enough to the
lava lake to make artificial heat un-
necessary

it- iser finished the roof of his cabin
none too soon for no sooner had
he added the last bit of mud and
thatch than there began a slow cold
precipitation of mist which was to
continue for many days his rude
roof held quite well however and in-
side his one-room cabin it was quite
cozy although the rain had prevent-
ed his attempting to make even so
much as a bed or a chair in the way
of household furniture

  being kept thus indoors was very
irksome for he had nothing to read
and he wondered if he could read if
he did have the marbs brain not
earthworms of karma



being equipped with a center con-
trolling the ability to recognize
printed characters he could only lie
upon the leaf-covered floor and long
for the coming of the sunshine

  for three of the short days and as
many nights he had been kept inside
by the rain he was lying half asleep
upon the floor of his cabin when sud-
denly there came a knock at his door
surprized into full wakefulness he
sprang to his feet drew his knife as
a precautionary measure and caie-
fully opened the door juak the
female marb was standing upon his
doorstep

  angered at this brazen effrontery
baser was upon the verge of slam-
ming the door shut in her face but
she was gesticulating frantically and
speaking with a great deal of em-
phasis in an effort to impart some
seemingly important information
and although he could not understand
her words he could at least attempt
an investigation of that part of the
forest she was indicating in an effort
to learn what it was which distressed
her so he stepped out and closed the
door behind him

  kiser having signaled his readiness
to follow the marb set out in the
direction she had indicated as hold-
ing something of rare interest using
the greatest caution to avoid detec-
tion by some unseen foe by moving
with the greatest stealth-peering
from behind trees and moving from
one tree to another with great cau-
tion

  seeing that she had had the pres-
ence of mind to acquire the reseue-
mans rope which she slung across
her shoulder kiser respected her
attitude of vigilance and did likewise
from tree to tree and from bush to
bush they advanced never more than
a few steps apart until presently the
marb halted assumed an attitude of
listening and put a hand upon
kisers arm beckoning him to ex-
treme caution

 for just a moment they waited

thus then kiser saw one of the res-
cue-men emerge from behind a tree
trunk and advance to another point
of vantage soon he saw another and
still another and they were moving
stealthily toward his cabin each
carrying an armful of large yellow
fruit resembling the tomato

  there were four of them and they
were slinking upon his domain pre-
sumably to poison him kisers first
thought was to let them try in vain
but he feared that they might destroy
his cabin which was none too strong-
ly built so he impulsively stepped
out from his hiding-place and con-
fronted them with drawn knife

  taken completely by surprize the
four creatures turned in their tracks
as one and beat an inglorious retreat
leaving four small heaps of the toma-
to-like fruit lying upon the ground
kiser stooped and picked up one of
these and examined it critically
there was certainly nothing wrong
with its appearance and it looked as
though it might taste delicious per-
haps after all the rescue-men were
trying to be friendly and had only in-
tended to secure his good-will by an
offering of rare food

  the marb however appeared to
think otherwise for when she saw
him handling this fruit she uttered a
hoarse screech and motioned for him
to drop it

  he could see no reason for haste in
disposing of the fruit but when she
continued to protest he drew back his
long arm and dashed it against a
near-by tree

  when he had done this the marb
uttered a cry of alarm and fled beck-
oning him to follow thinking her
fears quite probably due to super-
stition however he did not hasten
away and when he had stood his
ground but a moment his eyes closed
with a severe paroxysm of pain while
his nose and throat began burning as
though a red-hot iron had been
thrust into his nostrils

  he staggered coughing and gasp-


weird tales

ing awayfrom the spot at a loss to
account for the extreme pain in his
eyes throat and lungs he tried to
open his eyes in order to see some
avenue of escape but they were tight-
ly closed by muscle spasm and it was
impossible to see at all however he
soon felt the guiding hand of the
marb upon his arm and he walked
beside her in an agony of pain which
was not so great but that he pondered
upon the magnanimity of this beast
who was thus aiding the slayer of her
mate-or was it brazen grossness
prompting her to actually court the
marb who had vanquished her hus-
band

  she guided him to the door of his
cabin and assisted him inside but
when after some moments he suc-
ceeded in opening his eyes she was
gone

  she had not been courting his at-
tention then after all what man-
ner of marb was this which would go
to such length to rescue a stranger-
an enemy-and then quietly slink
away when the danger no longer
threatened the idea which kabo
and delam oblene had given him re-
garding these animals as well as his
own experience with two of them
was indicative of their viciousness
and vileness of temper rather than of
any gentleness or amiability he
could not understand any such action
upon the part of the mate of the
slain crobe unless-

  heavens could it be possible that
kabo had been so vile as to perlorm
his horrid operation upon someone
else-and had he sent some martian
girl here to mate with kiser after
having transplanted her soul into the
body of juak the marb

  but no if she were a martian she
could probably speak some earth
language since all martians had lived
on earth in a previous incarnation
and could remember the incidents of
their earth life yet there was the
case of his nurse who could speak
neither english french nor german

  and yet reflected kiser the mar-
tians remembered their previous in-
carnations by virtue of a certain
brain center which served as a special
medium of contact between the ego
and the conscious mind enabling
them to recall their pre-natal experi-
ences and if a martian were given
the physical brain of a marb which
has no such center then most certain-
ly such a person could not recall his
terrestrial experiences nor could he
speak any other language than mar-
tian

  again this creature had known and
spoken his name as well as that of-
of-

 by god kiser sprang to his
feet in great agitation that is
delam oblene

	abandoned

ruth hervy regained consciousness
with a start she gasped with
amazement and shock as she was sud-
denly immersed in icy cold water

  she opened her eyes to find that
her abductor had plunged boldly into
the canal and was swimming toward
the opposite shore with her upon his
shoulder and her remonstration
made not the slightest impression
upon him she begged pleaded
scolded and threatened but he con-
tinued on his way with apparent un-
concern until they reached the bank
where he placed her upon her feet
while he shook himself and squeezed
some of the water from his clothing
then lightly swung her across his
shoulder again and entered the forest

  by this time ruth was trembling
from fright as well as cold she
struggled to free herself from this
madman by swinging her feet down-
ward disturbing the equilibrium
with which he had balanced her he
overcame this movement with a slight
effort and held her more firmly she
continued her struggles with renewed
energy and at length succeeded in
freeing one of her arms from his em-
brace  then with a frenzy of fear and
earthworms of karma



anger she slapped his face with all
her strength

  angered at this evidence of insub-
ordination nebond quickly stood the
girl upon her feet and faced her with
bared teeth and an animal-like growl
and then as she recoiled from him in
horror and dismay he seized her by
the throat and shook her until she
again lost consciousness

  when again she opened her eyes it
was at the sound of voices strange
voices they were and in the martian
tongue that language being strictly
phonetic and very simple and easy to
speak she had learned to understand
it quite well although she spoke it
very poorly

  nebond placed her upon her feet
again but she was too weak to stand
she staggered weakly and fell to a
sitting posture staring with renewed
horror at the sight before her

  more than a dozen ferocious-look-
iiig marbs stood surveying the pair
with their pointed ears extended for-
ward and their eyes telescoping back
and forth in an attitude of hostile
inquiry

 you should remember me
roared her abductor i am nebond
i lived among you for years one
day kabo had me captured and car-
ried away now i have come back i
have came back to stay i do not fear
kabo do you hear me harken
nebond does not fear kabo let
kabo come and try again to capture
me and i shall rend him limb from
limb nebond is very strong stronger
than the strongest among you even
stronger than you pleck and i have
come back to the forest to rule as
your king if pleck resists my ascen-
sion to supremacy nebond will kill
pleck pleck must now abdicate for
nebond is going to be your king

  there was a hoarse growl from the
largest among the marbs and he
stepped forward fearlessly you
are both a liar and a fool he
screeched you are not nebond and
you are not stronger than i neither

are you going to cause me to abdicnte
in your favor you are some stranga
creature of absurd appearance whom
we never saw before you are not onai
of us go away or i shall kill yon
even as i have killed klegg and beoa
and huff and iibe and jamon and
ruel and himbo and jutt and herb
and parlo go away before i run
amuck

  yes many of these i remember
replied nebond some you may have
killed since my departure and you
have failed to mention lamo lame
was my father and though i hated
him and was glad when you killed
him it placed a stigma upon my fam-
ily name which i am going to wipe
out this day by killing you i shall
not only kill you but all your mates
and your children as well

  beware pleck is about to run
amuck and when pleck runs amuc-k
pleck never maims nor cripples-
pleck always kills

 nebond does not fear your
amuck this day pleck shall die

  ruth was astonished at hearing the
creature who she thought was joseph
kiser speaking in the martian tongue
without hesitancy or brogue just as
though he had never spoken any
other language at first she had sur-
mised that kiser must have lived
among these marbs and learned the
language from them but now it
seemed that he was both unknown
and unwelcome here his reference
to kabo escaped her quite because
the name sounded so much like those
of the marbs mentioned that she sur-
mised the reference was applied to a
marb and no thought of the scientist
entered her mind

  pleck was beginning to foam at the
mouth i shall now show you who
is going to be king of the marbs
he roared and bounded forward his
huge form a great mass of fury and
hatred

  nebond nimbly side-stepped this
attack and sprang forward in an at-
tempt to obtain a hold upon the


weird tales

others throat he missed however
aud as his shoulder came in contact
with the body of the huge marb the
beast closed his strong teeth upon his
shoulder having missed his throat by
the narrowest margin

  again and again nebond tried to
obtain a hold upon his antagonists
throat and as many times he was
foiled in the attempt he evaded the
brutes efforts to sever his jugular
vein by his superior strength alone
and he was fast becoming exhausted
by his strenuous efforts in this at-
mosphere which did not contain
enough oxygen to supply his needs
on account of his very limited lung
capacity while his antagonist seemed
as fresh and sturdy as at their first
moment of encounter

  nebond was beginning to realize
that his present physique was not
built for fighting as the marbs fight
his mouth was too small and his neck
too short to use his teeth to ad-
vantage and too the other marb had
an added advantage in his greater
reach and ability as well as his huge
chest and consequent greater lung
capacity

  nebonds head began to grow dizzy
-not from any injury pleck had
been able to inflict but from lack of
oxygen his breath came in quick
frothy gasps and his knees sagged
at length pleck secured a hold upon
his throat and the scenery spun
round his vision blurred his lungs
ached and had pleck released his hold
just then nebond would have begged
for mercy but pleck did not desist
his hold tightened and all went black
for nebond

  ruth watched this battle spell-
bound why did kiser not use his
fists why did he not grasp the ani-
mals arm as he had done upon that
previous occasion and wrench it joint
from joint with his superior strength
she saw him fight a losing fight
because he was attempting to use the
same fighting tactics as the marb and
was unable to do so she saw that his

wind was going fast and at length she
saw him limp and xhert in the grasp
of the murderous brute

  with this sight something seemed
to snap in her mind and with tha
heritage of several generations of
fighting hervys predominating she
sprang to her feet and assailed the
huge beast with her fists striking
blows straight from the shoulders as
her father had taught her for he had
often admonished her that every
woman should be able to defend her-
self in case it might become neces-
sary to do so

  that pleck thought but little of the
prowess of this new adversary was
evident he did not release his hold
upon nebonds throat but he was pre-
vented from ripping open his jugu-
lar as he attempted to ward off
ruths blows

  recalling the fight kiser had had
with the marb on the day of their
landing she suddenly caught the
huge beasts arm in both hands and
twisted with all her strength with
a howl of pain pleck released nebond
and turned with renewed energy
upon the girl

  pleck was astounded and his rage
was redoubled but regardless of how
fiercely he fought those blows which
she drove against his comparatively
fragile facial structures inflicted such
punishment as he had never endured
before and time after time he was
forced to desist in his efforts to reach
her throat and too the arm which
she had twisted was all but useless
and consequently he fought under an
added disadvantage

xtebond was beginning to regain
-  consciousness npw and as he rose
to his feet a shower of derisive sar-
casm was cast at him from the other
marbs congregated about but who
had offered no interference with the
combatants

  see see they shouted the
strong man is beginning to revive
the very strong man who would be
earthworms of karma



king ofthe marbs the strong man
who lets his mate do his fighting
the strong man who is not half so
strong as his she

  nebond stood gasping glaring first
at the taunting throng and then at
the combat between ruth and pleck
if he was astonished at seeing the
weak creature whom he had so easily
fetched into the forest thus besting
the mighty king of the marbs he did
not comment upon his surprize

  ruths composure was going fast
she was gasping for breath now and
her vision was beginning to blur she
made another attempt to twist her
adversarys arm and failed

  all things considered pleck prob-
ably desired least to have his arm
wrenched as she had wrenched the
other one he stepped back waving
her to truce

  i dislike to fight with females
he said your man has recovered
himself i see and i prefer to combat
with him you stand aside and see to
it that you do not interfere again if
you do i shall have the entire tribe
upon you if you do not they will not
interfere

  nebond had recovered his wind to
an extent and now he rushed upon
pleck and using the tactics he had
seen ruth use he grabbed the long
slender neck of the marb between his
two hands and pushed with all his
strength in opposite directions the
animals vertebra snapped and he fell
to the ground dead almost instantly
nebond had learned to use his great
strength effectively

  he then turned upon the others
and with great gusto proceeded to
run amuck the three marbs nearest
him were struck down with his
mighty fists another was maimed for
life by having his arm twisted until it
was broken and badly crushed and
nebond with the earth-developed
muscles of joseph kiser stood among
the other marbs loudly proclaiming
himself their king and demanding

 that plecks mates and offspring be
 pointed out to him

   this was very readily done for the
 marbs had felt his prowess and they
 had no wish to antagonize him the
 three wives and four young which
 comprised plecks family were ruth-
 lessly murdered while ruth looked on
 in horror protesting as best she could
 speaking brokenly in the martian
 tongue pleading with nebond to stop
 his wholesale and useless carnage
 but nebond paid not the slightest at-
 tention to her pleas he kept on until
 he had finished his gruesome task and
 then his amuck left him quite sudden-
 ly and he was calm but eight marbs
 had died at his hands and as many
 others were injured

   now i want pike go and fetch
 pike to me commanded nebond to
 one of the marbs who stood trembling
 near by this animal hastened to do
 his bidding and soon returned accom-
 panied by another marb a female
 and somewhat smaller than himself

  pike said nebond i have
 come back to you i am nebond re-
 turned from captivity to be the king
 of the marbs i have just killed pleck
 and all his shes and all his offspring
 i am the king now and you shall be
 my favorite queen

   you are not nebond retorted
 the female marb you are not even
 a marb you are that terrible creature
 who came from the sky in an iron
 craft and who so cruelly attacked
 beck many small moons ago you are
 a devil and the marbs do not want
 you for their king go away with the
 she you have with you and let the
 marbs alone

   do not dare to say to me that i
 am not nebond if you say that
 again i shall kill you i am nebond
 and you are pike my mate even as
 you were my mate before i was cap-
 tured by the masovadans come to
 me he held out his hand toward
 her and not daring to refuse she
 came and stood in his embrace

  but nebond was a marb she


weird tales

protested nebond would not dare
return from captivity to the forest
even if he might therefore shortly
after nebond was captured i mated
with beck i love beck and i do not
wish to leave him not even if the real
nebond should return  

  i tell you i am nebond and i told
you not to say i am not   he caught
the poor creature by the neck and
twisted until she screeched with pain
to the delight of the onlookers save
for ruth who watched with a feeling
of horror and disgust but even yet
she could not associate any such
action with the joseph kiser she had
known and she felt that this experi-
ence must be a horrid and unreal

nightmare-sureljs she would awake
presently for it deemed that she could
not endure it much longer

 yes nebond pike was saying
i will be your queen if you say i
must i dare not run amuck for i
know you would kill me i will be
your favorite queen but what are
you going to do with your other she
she is much more like you in appear-
ance-will she not be your favorite

  i shall give her to beck in ex-
change for you you are much more
beautiful and i do not care to mate
with her i shall forage upon the
domains of other tribes to obtain my
other mates but always you shall be
my favorite queen

                a vision stretched before me fairyland
                it seemed to be for lakes and trees and sand
                were not of earthly hue so strangely fair
                the tufted towers girt with jewels rare

               the curving spires whereon the gnome-guards stand
               to give swift warning for the fays to band
               and march in dread array oh man beware

               the faint sun dimmed forth from a black-capped cloud
               twelve monsters sprang to keep their savage tryst

                 then rose the roar of conflict fierce and loud

    of elfin shouting and of beasts that hissed

               the heavens blazoned forth a flaming shroud-

    and all dissolved into the morning mist
the fates which preside over the
destinies of mankind must have
been sitting up and taking notice
during the five minutes that i stood hes-
itating at the junction of the two paths
which ran in divergent directions over the
heather-clad scottish moor

   i had been fairly late in setting out from
gairloch where i had spent the previous
night but i thought i had allowed my-

self ample time in which to cover the fif-
teen or so miles which lay between that
little town and the coast village of mel
vaig where so i had been informed i
could obtain comfortable lodgings but
the proposed itinerary of a solitary walk-
ing-tour such as i was then enjoying is
liable to be somewhat elastic i had
dawdled away most of the day stopping
now and again to admire the glorious

                                   

take that knowledge to hell with you


weird tales

scenery of the ross coast and to indulge
in a quiet smoke while lying on the fra-
grant heather and when the twilight be-
gan to close in unusually early by reason
of the dark and threatening clouds over-
head i discovered that i was still a good
many miles from my destination

  such was the situation when i halted
at the crossroads in the gathering dusk
undecided which to pursue the path to
my left ran along the coast and by fol-
lowing it i would ultimately arrive at
melvaig but the one which slanted off at
an angle to my right seemed to lead direct
to a very cheerful cluster of lights about
a mile distant across the purple moor

  it was i concluded a village of some
sort a village would probably mean an
inn and an inn would mean shelter of a
more or less comfortable description i
felt sorely tempted to forego the assured
comforts of melvaig in favor of the near-
er entertainment which the winking lights
to my right seemed to promise

  a sudden spatter of heavy raindrops
on my face decided me i turned away
from the sea and headed across the moor
at my best pace

  i soon discovered however that the
lights were not so near as i had first sup-
posed them to be moreover the path i
was following did not seem to lead di-
rectly to them it twisted and turned in
different directions until i lost all pa-
tience with its devious windings by this
time the rain had settled into a steady
driving downpour and wreaths of white
mist were beginning to settle among the
hollows of the moor i knew that the
folk who lived thereabouts kept early
hours any moment they might take it into
their heads to extinguish the lights and
go to bed in which case i might spend the

rest of the night in wanderiflg about that
desolate stretch of moorland  finally i
found that the path i was treading seemed
to be branching off at right angles to the
place i was now desperately anxious to
reach it was this last straw that snapped
my already overtaxed patience

   here goes i cried as i left the guid-
ance of the path and struck across country
in the direction of the beckoning lights

  after i had been walking ten minutes i
began to notice that the ground was get-
ting very soft underfoot at first i did
not attach much importance to this set-
ting it down to the heavy rain but i soon
found myself ankle-deep

  i backed away from this muddy patch
and walked a few dozen yards to the
right in order to avoid it the next min-
ute i was immersed to the knees in the
treacherous morass

  too late i understood the reason for
the zigzag windings of the road i had so
rashly quitted i turned and waded
back through the clinging slime only too
eager to regain the road but it was very
difficult to judge my sense of direction
once i had lost sight of the distant lights
i floundered on almost at random at ev-
ery step sinking deeper in the sucking
ooze yet i knew i must keep moving
for the moment i attempted to stand still
i began to sink

  on i struggled blindly desperately
trusting to chance to lead me out of that
quivering death-trap then of a sudden
the ground seemed to open engulfing me
waist-deep in the marsh

  then did the icy hand of despair clutch
my heart in real earnest i knew not
which way to turn yet it meant death to
stand still but whichever way i turned
i seemed only to sink deeper in the mire
the hound of duncardin



in vain i tried to gain a firmer foothold-
the yielding slime encompassed me on
every side

  help help i shouted at the top
of my voice

  but the only answer was the sough of
the wind and the bubbling of the ooze
around me far away across the dismal
expanse the cheery lights that had lured
me to my doom seemed to mock me with
their unchanging stare

  in my frenzy i cursed them-cursed
my own folly in leaving the path-the
clinging mud-the darkness   

  help i shouted with the full force
of my panting lungs

  the echoes of my voice died away my
strength was exhausted i could struggle
no more it was the end but even as
i steeled myself to meet the inevitable i
heard a deep-throated baying near at
hand and a moment later a huge shaggy
form loomed dimly through the dark-
ness

  thus did i make my first acquaintance
with the hound of duncardin

a great wave of returning hope surged
through my heart at the coming of
this four-footed friend in need where
such an animal could tread a man could
follow without being engulfed i turned
and struggled in the direction of the dog
and he on his part seemed to encourage
my efforts by a series of loud but friendly
barks soon i had the satisfaction of
feeling the ground becoming firmer and
presently i was able to drag myself pant-
ing but elated on to a grassy hillock the
unerring instinct of the animal had saved
me from the fate which my own reason
had been powerless to avert

  after a few minutes i rose to my feet

whereupon the dog trotted on a yard or
so ahead giving a low whine now and
again as though inviting me to follow
him and i was only too pleased to avail
myself of his friendly guidance i pur-
posely refrained from attempting to make
friends with him thinking that i might
distract his attention and cause him to
follow me instead of allowing me to fol-
low him i trudged on in silence until
i heard my boots crunching on the hard
gravel of the highroad

  good dog i called out coaxingly
wise old boy ill buy you the finest
feed of meat you ever tasted as soon as i
can home boy home show me
where you live like a wise old doggie
he gave a short bark and wagged his tail
as if he understood my words then trot-
ted on ahead as before i quickened my
steps in order to get a nearer look at him

  until then i had naturally assumed it
to be one of the sheep-dogs belonging to
an adjacent croft but now even in the
darkness i came to the conclusion that
the dog was much too large to belong to
that breed little as i felt inclined to
criticize its appearance i could not help
thinking what a weird-looking creature
it was it seemed to be built on some-
what similar lines to a greyhound but it
was much larger and its coat instead of
being smooth was of long rough hair in
hue a peculiar shade of pallid gray my
impression was necessarily vague for it
was gleaned by the flickering flame of a
match as i paused to light my pipe it
appeared to me however that the dog
was an unusually large specimen of the
scottish deerhound

  but had he been the sorriest-looking
mongrel breathing i should have been
quite content to follow my four-footed


weird tales

rescuer wherever he might lead truth
to tell i was beginning to grow quite
fond of his company and i determined
that if his owner was disposed to part with
him for a reasonable sum he would find
a good home with me for the rest of his
days

  as things turned out however i never
had the chance of speaking to his owner
for we had no sooner arrived in the im-
mediate neighborhood of the lighted win-
dows which had been the initial cause of
my trouble than he gave vent to a long
mournful howl and raced across the moor
until he was swallowed up in the darkness
of the night

  i called after him and whistled for sev-
eral minutes but he did not return so i
turned again to the welcoming lights-
only to utter a gasp of sheer amazement
and remain staring at what i saw

i had fully expected to find myself con-
fronted with a tiny crofters cottage
or at most with a fair-sized sheep farm
instead i saw before me a massive iron-
studded gate defended by portcullis and
numerous machicolations overhead and
flanked by turrets bearing the extinguish-
er-shaped roofs so commonly seen in scot-
tish mediaeval architecture beyond the
outer walls i caught a dim impression of
the sheer towers and lofty battlements of
a central keep

  this was certainly a very different end-
ing from what i had anticipated for a
while i stood there overawed by the im-
posing majesty of the mighty building i
had stumbled upon all unawares the
very walls seemed to look down in frown-
ing disdain upon my weary and mud-be-
draggled figure as though daring me to
invade their haughty precincts -to use

the expressive scotch j idiom the place
looked unco ghaisdy and  found my-
self wishing more heartily than ever that
i had kept to my original intention of
making for melvaig

  presently my eyes caught the glint of
brass upon the ancient timbers of the gate
it was a very modem-looking bell-button
and on the outer rim it bore the prosaic
invitation push

  i placed my finger on the ivory knob
and pushed accordingly and presently in
response to the distant whirring of an
electric bell footsteps sounded on the
stone flags on the other side and the door
swung silently open

  although my appearance at that lonely
spot might well have occasioned some
surprize there was no sign of such an
emotion on the sedate features of the el-
derly liveried man-servant who appeared
in a few words i explained that i had lost
my way on the moors and asked if he could
direct me to the nearest inn the latter
request brought a ghost of a smile to his
shaven lips

  the nearest said ye he repeated
with peculiar emphasis wheest man
do ye no ken that this is duncardin cas-
tle and the nearest hoose o call is a mat-
ter o eight miles awa

  as he mentioned the name of the cas-
tle something seemed to stir faintly in the
depths of my memory when and where
had i heard that narrie before for a
moment i stood vainly trying to fix the
half-forgotten associations then like a
flash of light streaming into a darkened
room recollection came-alan duncar-
din the young one-pip who had joined
our battalion when we were holding the
water-logged ditches which went by the
name of trendies to the west of armen-
the hound of duncardin



tieres could it b possible that there
was some connection between the two

   the subject of the various nationalities
of the men who formed the scottish regi-
ments was something of a standing joke
in the british army for it was asserted
that they came from anywhere except
north of the tweed but the traditional
gibe had no point in the case of second-
lieutenant duncardin a tall lanky raw-
boned youth with sandy hair and a seri-
ous freckled face he was every inch a true
highlander-ye micht almaist see the
heather grawin betwix his taes as our
old pipe-major once declared solemnly
all this passed through my mind so
quickly that there was scarcely a notice-
able pause before i again addressed the
man

  does mr alan duncardin live here

  nae doot ye mean sir alan duncar-
iin

  yes i returned hoping that i was
speaking the truth will you give him
my card

  the man ushered me into the lofty
antler-hung hall and disappeared in quest
of his master a few moments later the
door opened and i saw that my chance
shot had indeed hit the mark the man
who came eagerly forward with out-
stretched hand was the young subaltern
whom i had last seen being carried down
the communication trench badly gassed

  no sooner did he learn of my misad-
ventures of the night than he dragged me
upstairs and insisted on my donning one
of his spare suits while my own soaking
clothes were drying after a hearty sup-
per and a stiff glass of whisky i felt more
comfortable than i had ever hoped to feel
that night

  you had a close call on the marsh

said alan if you had passed it by day
light you would have seen the notices
which ive had put up warning travelers
to keep to the road

  i have to thank your dog that i am
here at all i rejoined but my host shook
his head

  it wasnt my dog the only dog we
have is a toy spaniel belonging to lady
annabel my stepmother the dog you
saw must have been a stray sheep-dog
from somewhere or other the intelli-
gence of such animals is marvelous i
have seen one of them without any super-
vision bring in a herd of thirty cows one
by one to the milking-house without ever
fetching a second time a cow which has
been milked

  i shook my head im positive that
the dog that guided me here was a deer-
hound i said

  impossible the only dog of that
breed about here died over a year since
alan said impatiently and abruptly
changed the subject

  we sat yarning and smoking and fight-
ing our battles over again until late in
the night he told me that he had come
into the title and estates some eighteen
months previously when his elder brother
had died after a brief illness his father
sir james duncardin had married a sec-
ond time and his widow the present
lady-dowager annabel occupied a sep-
arate suite of rooms in the great rambling
castle together with her son ian who
was alans half-brother and next in suc-
cession most of the older portions of
the feudal stronghold were shut up and
unoccupied

   its a very interesting old place said
alan you must let me take you over
it in the morning-for of course youre
going to make this your headquarters foil


weird tales

the next week or so ive already ordered
your room to be got ready by die way
he added with a smile i hope youre
not scared of ghosts

  why have you got a family specter
or two on the premises i laughingly in-
quired

  so they say he answered carelessly
and proceeded to lead the way up a wind-
ing stone staircase to my bedroom

i got something of a surprize when i
entered the breakfast room the follow-
ing morning my mind in response to
alans description of his stepmother as
the lady-dowager had conjured up a
vision of a venerable silvery-haired old
jady clad in rustling black silk who more
probably than not supported her tottering
footsteps with the aid of an ebony stick
imagine my astonishment to find myself
being introduced to a radiandy beautiful
young lady who appeared to be scarcely
older than alan himself she must have
married the late sir james unusually
young i decided as i regarded her pale
though petal-clear skin and the wavy
masses of hair which shining with the
glossy mack luster of a birds plumage
framed the perfect oval of her face her
tyes shadowed with long lashes held in
their dark depths a baffling expression
that was at once languorous yet keenly
alert the set of her firm scarlet lips the
enly touch of color in her face appeared
ca hint at unusual determination and fix-
ity of purpose

  ian duncardin her son had inherited
sjmething of her dark exotic beauty but
feis face bore a sulky expression and for
sme reason or other he seemed just then
e be somewhat ill at ease

  we chatted on different subjeas dur-
isg the meal and presently i began to
cr than of my adventure on the moor

i had just reached the point where i was
describing the coming of the strange
hound when alan thought fit to supple-
ment my tale with a few words of-to my
thinking unnecessary-explanation

  of course it was some wandering
sheep-dog he interposed

  i shook my head decisively no i
am prepared to take my oath that the ani-
mal i saw was a huge gray-coated deer-
hound

  a sudden crash interrupted me the
coffee-cup had fallen from lady anna-
bels hand and she was staring across the
table at me with parted lips and wide-
open eyes

  a deerhound did you say she
asked slowly

   im sure of it i returned not a little
puzzled to account for her intense inter-
est in the breed of the dog im very
fond of dogs and i take a great interest
in the various breeds it was a deer-
hound sure enough i intend to take a
long tramp across the moor this morning
in the hope of renewing my acquaintance
with my friend in need

  i dont think youll meet that dog
again said lady annabel slowly but
if you do i should advise you to give it
a wide berth

  i lifted my eyebrows at this why
do you think it is dangerous

   she nodded her dark head once or twice
as she regarded me through narrowed lids

  yes she said at length it migfcc
be very dangerous and after a pause
she repeated the last two words under
her breath very dangerous

  i smiled to myself but said nothing
it seemed to me that alans beautiful
stepmother was unusually nervous where
dogs were concerned subsequent events
proved that she hsd need to be
the hound of duncardin



   breakfast over alan took me for a tour
of inspection over the old castle i say
tour advisedly for the place proved to
be much more extensive than i had at
first supposed although interesting
enough from an antiquarian point of
view the dark corridors and deserted
chambers had a grim forbidding air the
old chieftain who had reared it had
planned with an eye to strength rather
than comfort and but few modern im-
provements had been added subsequently

  lastly he showed me the chapel it
was small but a perfect gem of pure
gothic architecture with exquisite stone
carvings on the capitals of the pillars and
the frettings of the vaulted roof here
were the tombs of every head of the
house of duncardin from the first sir
roderick to alans elder brother who had
been laid their eighteen months ago

   he died young i remarked as i read
the inscription chiseled on the marble
slab which covered the entrance to the
vault did he meet with an accident

  alan duncardin shook his head with-
out speaking and immediately turned and
led the way out of the chapel glancing
at his face i noticed that he looked un-
usually pale and as he mounted the spiral
stair his breathing became labored and
irregular

   its that cursed gas he gasped jerk-
ily ive never been the same since it
bowled me over that night when the ger-
mans made their big drive at bois grenier
im sorry to leave you on your own but
i think ill have to turn in for a bit until
i feel a little better would you mind
helping me to my room and asking du-
gald to send for dr blair

  although alan tried to make light of
his illness i could see that he was in con-

siderable internal pain but somehow or
other i could not reconcile his symptoms
with the after-effects of poison gas it
seemed to me more likely that he had
eaten something that had disagreed with
him

   i caught sight of dr blair as he passed
through the hall on his arrival he was
stout and elderly with a slow pompous
manner and he evidently possessed no
small opinion of his own importance

  poor alan has had one of his at-
tacks i heard lady annabel say as she
came forward to meet him

   oh ill soon set him right again was
the doctors confident reply nothing
to be alarmed about your ladyship these
attacks are distressing while they last and
-ah-undoubtedly painful but a little
treatment - ah - palliative treatment
which a practitioner of my large experi-
ence knows so well how to adminis-

  i could not help smiling to myself as
they passed out of earshot evidently
dr blair was a type of medical man that
is fast becoming extinct

in spite of the aged medicos confidence
in the efficacy of a little palliative
treatment it was quickly apparent that
alans illness was no trifling matter he
was confined to his bed the whole of the
next day and i was rigidly excluded from
his room left to my own devices i
routed out a very serviceable built-cane
rod and a book of flies and armed with
these i determined to see what sport the
sea-trout would afford in the neighboring
loch after lunch i waylaid dugald the
old butler and made a few inquiries as to
the best places to try

  aye theres some gran fush in yon


weird tales

loch he said in a tone which showed him
to be a keen enthusiast in the beloved
sport of izaak walton and he surprized
me somewhat by offering to accompany
me and act as gillie

   i was only too pleased to take advan-
tage of his offer for local knowledge
means a lot of difference to your haul
when fishing strange waters dugald
changed his clothes for a suit of home-
spun tweed and we set out together he
carrying a creel and a gaff whose dimen-
sions seemed to augur well for the size of
the fush he expected to encounter

   from a fly-fishers point of view the
weather was unusually promising the
sky was overcast with a thin veil of fleecy
clouds just sufficient to take the glare off
the water the gentle westerly breeze was
just strong enough to cause a tiny ripple
on the otherwise calm waters of the loch
old dugald pointed to where a series of
tiny swirling breaks showed on the sur-
face of the inshore shallows

   guidsakes sir but theyre takin fine
yell hae guid sport am thinkin

  the old man proved a true prophet
after an afternoon of pleasurable excite-
ment i had the satis faction of seeing five
fine trout none of them under three
pounds safely gaffed and transferred to
the creel by the time the fish had ceased
to rise the sun was already low in the
western sky

   i noticed that dugald seemed unusually
silent and thoughtful as we started to re-
turn he gave me the impression of want-
ing to say something without knowing
exactly how to begin when we were
almost at the castle gate he turned to me
with a question

   begging your pardon sir but did i
no hear ye tell her leddyship something

aboot a deerhoond that ye saw the nicht
ve came here	

   i told him of my adventure on the moor
and of the dog that had shown me the way
out of the swamp when i had finished
the old man shook his head

   i dinna ken any such dog hereaboots
he said slowly adding in a curious tone
of voice at least no the noo

   what do you mean i asked puzzled
as much by his tone as the broad doric

   dugald puckered his eyes and favored
me with an odd look

  the young laird sir malcolm used
to hae such a dog as yon and verra fond
of it he was too after sir malcolm
died the dog was aye scratching and
whining at his tomb in the auld chapel
the puir critters grief was pitiful to wit-
ness sir and in the end her leddyship had
to hae puir bruce-that was the dogs
name sir-she had to hae him destroyed

   so the dog is dead i asked rather
needlessly

   deid an buried sir these eighteen
months

   in that case it could not have been
bruce that i saw on the moor i re-
marked with a laugh

  there was a long pause during which
dugald strode by my side in silence
glancing out of the tail of my eye i saw
that he was stroking the strip of sandy-
gray whisker at the side of his face with
a curiously irresolute air at last he
stopped dead and grasped my arm

  the young laird died michty queer
and sudden an noo sir alans tuk wi the
same seemptoms-an mark ye her led-
dyships ain son is heir to the title and
estates-
the hound of duncardin



  i scared at the man blankly only half
comprehending the sinister meaning of
the fiercely whispered words

  good god man i cried what
do you suspect

  i suspect theres deils wurrk gang on
yonder he jerked his head toward the
distant towers now outlined black against
the glory of die dying sun its ma be-
lief that the hound ye saw was no mortal
critter and if i may make so bold id
like ye to let me know the meenit ye see
it again i sleep in the room wi the door
facing the passage belangin to your ain
room sir and i doot ill be wakin maist
the night

  as he said the words a faint sound was
borne to our ears on the wings of the ris
ing night wind far off and intermittent
though it was there could be no mistak-
ing the nature of that cry and i shivered
suddenly as though a sponge soaked in
ice-cold water had been passed down my
spine

  for the sound we heard was the long-
drawn mournful baying of a hound

tired out as i was by my long day in
the open air i found that sleep would
not come to me that night my mind
was busy with a thousand thoughts spec-
ulations and wild impracticable plans as
i lay staring up at the black-raftered ceil-
ing above my bed counting the quarters
as they were told by the old clock at the
foot of the stairs watching and waiting
for i knew not what

  to my ears strained to catch the slight-
est sound the ancient pile seemed filled
with a thousand vague noises the faint
impact of a shutter against the wall as it
swung in the wind the occasional whine
of the weathercock on the pointed roof of

the tower overhead as it swung to the ran-
dom gusts the flapping of a loose corner
of the tapestry on the wall and the slow
regular tapping of some beetle burrowing
in the ancient wainscot

  at last i could bear the tedium of my
own thoughts no longer i switched on
my electric pocket-lamp and took up a
book which i had begun earlier in the day
but the commonplace plot and the trite
phrases proved a more effective anodyne
than i had anticipated after reading a
page or two i was soundly asleep

  how long i slept i know not but i
woke with a start every nerve a-tingle
in the corridor outside was a sound differ-
ent from the natural noises of the night
it was the faint padding footfalls of a
large hound nearer and nearer they
came not ceasing until they were opposite
the door of my room then there came
the sound of snuffing at the crack between
the woodwork of the panels and the floor

  i passed my tongue over my dry lips
then called softly

  bruce

  the dog seemed to recognize his name
for he gave a low whine of recognition
and pawed eagerly against the door so
friendly and natural was his demonstra-
tion of delight that i felt my misgivings
vanish i rose put on a dressing-gown
and thrust my feet into my slippers then
i crossed to the door and-not without
some slight hesitation i confess-pulled
back the bolt and allowed it to swing open

  standing on the threshold wagging his
long bushy tail with pleasure was the
deerhound that had saved me from the
marsh

  for a moment i stared at him in won-
dering silence scarcely knowing what to
think then bruce bounded forward


weird tales

thrust his muzzle against my legs his
great expressive eyes looking up into my
face and then at the door with an appeal
there could be no mistaking

  i leant down and patted his coarse
shaggy coat

  what is it bruce old boy i said

  the great dog trotted out into the cor-
ridor then half turned and stood watch-
ing me whining softly the while it was
an unmistakable invitation for me to fol-
low him

  mindful of my promise to the old but-
ler i tapped lightly on his door it was
immediately opened by dugald who
fully dressed had been awaiting the
summons

  guid presairve us the old man whis-
pered in an awed voice  tis auld
bruce himself

  and he wants to lead us somewhere
i returned come let us follow him

  treading as softly as possible we passed
along the corridor and down the spiral
staircase to the ground floor there the
dog made straight for the door leading
into the old chapel

   tis as i thocht sir the puir beast
is makin for his maisters grave

  the old mans hands were trembling
so that he could scarcely fit the key in the
lock but at last he had the door open
then straight as an arrow the hound
made for the marble slab which covered
the tomb of the dead laird and began
scratching frantically at it with his paws

  is there a vault below that stone i
asked the white-haired man at my side

  aye sir but surely--

  help me to raise it i interrupted

  exerting our united strength we
shifted the slab to one side beneath was
a square stone-lined cavity containing a

single coffin the dog immediately leapt
down and i pausing only to thrust my
lamp into dugalds shaking hand and
bid him direct the beam downward fol-
lowed the agitation of the dog was piti-
ful when i commenced to loosen the
screws of the coffin lid with the blade of
my knife but unheedful of everything
save the task before me i worked stead-
ily until the last one was extracted and
the lid was free

  slowly reverently i uncovered the
face of the body within then-

  what is the meaning of this de-
manded a harsh metallic voice above me

  it was lady annabel her face death-
white her dark eyes charged with hor-
ror and it seemed with fear as well i
scrambled out of the vault and stood fac-
ing her

  it means that i have solved the mys-
tery of sir malcolms untimely death i
said slowly and unless i mistake not
of sir alans present illness

  youre mad came from the womans
faltering lips

  i pointed downward into the vault

  look upon the face of the dead lady
annabel i said sternly there is only
one thing that would preserve a body un-
corrupted for so long a time sir mal-
colm met his death by arsenic

  lady annabel slowly raised her hand
and for the first time i saw that she held
a small silver-plated revolver i saw the
shining barrel change into a circle as she
aimed the weapon at me and i gave my-
self up for lost

  a horrible rasping laugh came from
her lips

  youre right-i poisoned him she
cried take that knowledge with you to
hell

  i threw myself flat as the weapon
just a song at twilight



cracked and i heard the smack of the
bullet on the stones above my head im-
mediately afterward another report
echoed through the silent chapel when
i rose unsteadily to my feet it was to see

the murderess lying slain by her own
hand by the side of her victims grave

  but the faithful hound whose love
and devotion death itself had been power-
less to quench was nowhere to be seen

a brief iveird tale

just a song at
twilight

by august w derleth

they heard it first a week after
edward had been taken ill they
were sitting in the living-room
before the fireplace waiting for the
doctor to come down to them from the
darkened room above when they heard
the woman singing it came quite sud-
denly and mrs grant started forward

  my dear she said turning to her
husband i do believe that wretched
nurse is singing

  nonsense said he it is most like-
ly a woman somewhere on the street
mrs grant hesitated i dont think
it is john its somewhere in this
house im sure i think she said half
rising i shall go look for it

  he patted her arm gently you
should go and rest darling this con-
stant waiting is upsetting you too much
i am quite certain that the singing is
outside and if it isnt we can always
track it down tomorrow

  abruptly the doctor came into the
room he put down his case and came
over to the fireplace where he stood
confronting them

  well said john grant looking up
at him

  the doctor took off his pince-nez and
rubbed them reflectively for a moment
before replying then he shrugged his
shoulders jerkily and said i can hardly
say definitely now the boy has a strong
fever and im afraid delirium is not far
away in cases of this kind absolute
quiet is necessary now i heard some
one singing just before and that must
be stopped at once the doctor cast a
quick glance in the direction of mrs
grant

  then it was not the nurse said
mrs grant

  certainly not replied the doctor
i thought-felt that it came from this
floor

  and i am sure it came from above
said mrs grant

  a woman in the street i think
said john grant easily

  oh exclaimed the doctor i am
sorry i was so sure that it came from
somewhere in the house curious how


weird tales

one is deceived sometimes but then
you have such a big house

  the cook murmured mrs grant
in an undertone as if she had not heard
my dear said john grant sharply
the doctor raised his eyebrows very
slightly and for a moment his face
seemed very uneasy this boy he
said suddenly you say he is not your
own child

  no said grant no he isnt
though of course weve made him feel
as much our own as the others no we
found him one night on our doorstep
bitter cold it was and of course we
took him in

  you advertised said the doctor
putting on his glasses once more

  nothing came of it so we adopted
die poor fellow john grant rose with
alacrity let me go to the door with
you doctor

  he took the doctors arm and to-
gether the two men moved out of the
room john grant closed the door of
the living-room softly behind him

  will you have a cigar doctor he
asked drawing a vest-pocket case from
his dressing-gown

  thank you i will

  john grant waited until the doctor
was well started on the cigar before he
spoke youll forgive me for not
smoking with you i hope he said
but there are a few things id like to
say to you

  yes i thought there was something
on your mind grant said the doctor
is it about your wife

  not exactly no its the boy
  oh said the doctor im afraid

for him of course i dont think-

   its not that said john grant hast-
ily its something else you know i

think the boy has the most startling de-
lusions sometimes

                                                f 

  indeed well that is rather com-
mon in cases like this

  no no doctor you dont under-
stand i mean when hes not ill at all
he has the delusions then when we
first took him into this house-why he
found his way about here with startling
rapidity he seemed to know every
nook and cranny of the house before
either my wife or i did i had the most
uncanny feeling-you know it was al-
most as if the boy had been here before
the doctor raised his eyebrows and
regarded the glowing end of his cigar
reflectively i dont think of that as a
delusion he said slowly thats quite
a natural thing-this extraordinary ca-
pacity for finding their way about-in
children especially

  no said john grant if that
were all the boy knew just where the
nursery was for instance and the
longer he stayed with us the more pecu-
liar he became he used to speak very
often of having played there before and
then hed mention the others i cant
make it out my wife thought it very
peculiar at first but finally she thought
that perhaps the boy was playing a little
game all his own

  possible said the doctor shortly
how old was the boy when you found
him

  four or five i think said grant
hed evidently walked to this place
from wherever he came he was hud-
dled up against the door in all that cold
well said the doctor have you
ever considered that he might have been
here before

  i looked up the family whod had
this house for years before we came
just a song at twilight



family by the name of carroll there
was only one child and he died quite
earl i understand

  the doctor nodded well he said
ill go over my books and hunt up
parallel cases you know we scientific
men are rather skeptical im afraid
what youre driving at is some sort of
reincarnation and thats a little stiff
ill expect to hear from you said
grant

  the doctor picked up his case and
moved toward the outer door

  and by the way said john grant
on the threshold if you hear that sing-
ing again doctor-id rather you said
nothing about it to my wife

  the doctor looked hard at grant
very well he said i wont but
ill tell you it had better stop for the
boys sake

  a woman outside said grant lame

ty-

  sheer nonsense said the doctor
sharply that singing came from
somebody in the house and it excited the
boy very much

john grant closed the door and
walked slowly down the hall and into
the living-room his wife had gone
upstairs but he saw the white-clad form
of the nurse waiting to speak to him

  my wife has gone up he asked as
he came up to her

  the nurse nodded yes she is
with the boy now and i came down to
tell you as you asked me to about the
singing it was so much louder to-
night you must have heard it

  i did both of us did as a matter
of fact

   yes the doctor did too she con-
tinued and the boy    why he was

positively wild in spite of his weak con-
dition-seemed to want to sing along
and actually tried

  did you get the words asked john
grant we couldnt distinguish words
down here

  the woman was singing loves old
sweet song-quite an old piece said
the nurse

  john grant nodded thoughtfully is
there anydiing more he asked

  yes said the nurse i saw the
woman

   john grant looked at tlie nurse you
saw her how was that surely she
was not in edwards room

  no she wasnt said the nurse
when the doctor first heard the sound
he said for me to go and see who was
singing i felt it would do no good
but i stepped outside the door of the
room for a moment and there she was
standing at the end of the hall

  what did she look like

  seemed to be in some kind of bath-
robe she was not very clearly outlined
and except for her face was all grayish
i could see through her

   what did you do asked grant

   i went toward her and she just van-
ished melted away said the nurse

  brave girl said grant anybody
else would have screamed to bring the
house down

   id better go back up now said the
nurse and john grant nodded

next day john grant went to see the
agent who had sold him the house
and had told him about the carrolls

  i remember telling you that there
were queer stories about the house said
mr barnes and i think you made a
bit of a joke of the matter the woman


weird tales

who sings the twilight song is one of the
stories

  well who is she supposed to be
asked john grant

  the agent shrugged his shoulders
thats more than i can say he said
but theres one thing you might keep
in mind mrs carroll went a little mad
after the death of her son and died not
long after and the sons name by the
way was edward

  why exclaimed grant thats
more than a coincidence

  i cant tell you any more mr
grant continued the agent if any-
thing further happens come in again to
see me ill do what i can for you
one thing more said grant tell
me do you believe in reincarnation
mr barnes favored his visitor with a
smile which very clearly expressed his
contempt for reincarnation why no
he said very affably i dont think i
do

  the doctor when he came was like-
wise inclined to look very severely on
grants curious idea its preying on
your mind grant and thats bad for you
get rid of the idea somehow its just
something that seems to fit a peculiar
set of circumstances thats all

  i wish said grant stonily that it
were let us drop the matter doctor
how is the boy

  very low said the doctor gravely
frankly i dont think i shall be needed
again

  grant nodded all right doctor
about when do you think

  he may last through until morning
that will give him a better chance again
but if he is disturbed-in any way ex-
cited during the night-he cant last

  john grant nodded thoughtfully
very well

   and dont for his sake let that woman
start singing again tonight

  grant smiled wryly do you think
she would have sung before if i could
have stopped her

   the doctor looked at grant suspiciously
see here grant he said picking up his
case you watch yourself or youll go
under one of these days

  with that the doctor was gone and
john grant turned back and went into
the living-room his wife was watch-
ing for him looking eagerly over the
back of the chair

   what did he say she asked

   there is little hope darling very
little but he may last through the
night if he is not disturbed then he
will have a much better chance he
tried to smile encouragingly but he felt
that the attempt was not quite successful

   he dropped into a chair at her side
reached out and took her hand and sat
with her looking into the dancing flames
before them there they sat listening
for a sound above the ticking of the clock
and the distant hum of motors on the
road outside-a sound of quick feet and
the nurses low call but there was
nothing

the minutes passed and the hours and
then suddenly came the singing
it was very low but clear and sweet
john grant must have dozed off for his
wifes convulsive grasp on his hand
brought him up in his chair fullv awake
on the instant

   just  a song    at    twi-light
   when  the lights    are    low

   and    the flick-ring    shadows
   soft-ly come    and    go    j
just a song at twilight



there it was in the air all about them

  edward said mrs grant suddenly
that is for edward

  my dear said john grant looking
with alarm at his wifes strained features
it is probably the cook after all

  no no said mrs grant the
cook is gone i know-what it is she
is coming for the boy-i can feel it
mrs grant sprang up suddenly i am
going up she said

  at the same instant came the sound
of swift pattering feet and from the
stairs beyond came the low voice of the
nurse come quickly  i think hes
going

   john grant was in the hall as quickly
as his wife running up the stairs they
heard the nurse going back to edwards
room and above the sound of running
feet the singing

   tho  the heart    be   wea-iy

sad  the day    and    long    

and then suddenly just before they
reached the second floor the singing be-

gan all over again and now    there
were two voices and one was the voice
of a boy

  john grant and his wife were half-
way down the hall quite near the sick-
room when mrs grant stopped abrupt-
ly and clung to her husband sobbing
too late she said too late

  at the same moment the door of the
sickroom opened and the nurse ap-
peared nodding her head gone she
said

  then together the three turned to
look down the hall where at its end a
faint grayness of two figures had inex-
plicably appeared there seemed to be
a woman and at her side clasping her
hand a boy and as they were walking
along through the wall and out into the
sky there came the sound of the song
growing always fainter and fainter and
dwindling away at last to nothing

   just  a song    at    twi-light

   when  the lights    are    low

   and  the flick-ting    shadows

   soft-iy come    and    go

ghosts

by jewell bothwell tull

 tis said that nothing lives in the dark
   that growing things must have the light

 but i have seen the moon grow big
   and beautiful at night

 and in the night my soul grows big
   with doubt and hope and love and pain

 that fade away with morning light

   leaving me cold again

 the moon is made of old dead dreams-
   pale echoes of a living sun

 the moon and i are lonely ghosts
 that die when dreams are done
  the permanent stiletto

by w c morrow

i had sent in all haste for doctor
rowell but as yet he had not arrived
and the strain was terrible there lay
my young friend upon his bed in the
hotel and i believed that he was dying
only the jewelled handle of the knife was
visible at his breast the blade was wholly
sheathed in his body

  pull it out old fellow begged the
sufferer through white drawn lips his
gasping voice being hardly less distress-
ing than the unearthly look in his eyes

  no arnolcf said i as i held his
hand and gently stroked his forehead it
may have been instinct it may have been
a certain knowledge of anatomy that
made me refuse

  why not it hurts he gasped it
was pitiful to see him suffer this strong
healthy daring reckless young fellow

  doctor rowell walked in-a tall grave
man with gray hair he went to the
bed and i pointed to the knife-handle
with its great bold ruby in the end and
its diamonds and emeralds alternating in
quaint designs in the sides the phy-


sician started he felt arnolds pulse
and looked puzzled

  when was this done he asked

  about twenty minutes ago i an-
swered

  the physician started out beckoned me 
to follow

  stop said arnold we obeyed
do you wish to speak of me he asked

  yes replied the physician hes-
itating

  speak in my presence then said my
friend i fear nothing it was said in
his old imperious way although his suf-
fering must have been great

  if you insist--

  i do

  then said the physician if you
have any matters to adjust they should
be attended to at once i can do nothing
for you

  how long can i live asked arnold

  the physician thoughtfully stroked his
gray beard it depends he finally
said if the knife be withdrawn you may
live three minutes if it be allowed to re-
the permanent stiletto



main you may possibly live an hour or
two-not longer

  arnold never flinched

  thank you he said smiling faintly
through his pain my friend here will
pay you i have some things to do let
the knife remain he turned his eyes
to mine and pressing my hand said af-
fectionately and i thank you too old
fellow for not pulling it out

  the physician moved by a sense of
delicacy left the room saying ring if
there is a change i will be in the hotel
office he had not gone far when he
turned and came back pardon me
said he but there is a young surgeon in
the hotel who is said to be a very skilful
man my specialty is not surgery but
medicine may i call him

  yes said i eagerly but arnold
smiled and shook his head i fear there
will not be time he said but i refused
to heed him and directed that the sur-
geon be called immediately i was writ-
ing at arnolds dictation when the two
men entered the room

there was something of nerve and
assurance in the young surgeon that
struck my attention his manner though
quiet was bold and straightforward and
his movements sure and quick this
young man had already distinguished
himself in the performance of some dif-
ficult hospital laparotomies and he was
at that sanguine age when ambition looks
through the spectacles of experiment
doctor raoul entrefort was the new-
comers name he was a creole small
and dark and he had travelled and stud-
ied in europe

  speak freely gasped arnold after
doctor entrefort had made an examina-
tion

  what think you doctor asked en-
trefort of the older man

  i think was the reply that the
knifeblade has penetrated the ascending
aorta about two inches above the heart
so long as the blade remains in the
wound the escape of blood is compar-
atively small though certain were the
blade withdrawn the heart would almost
instantly empty itself through the aortal
wound

  meanwhile entrefort was deftly cut-
ting away the white shirt and the under-
shirt and soon had the breast exposed
he examined the gem-studded hilt widi
the keenest interest you are proceed-
ing on the assumption doctor he said
that this weapon is a knife

  certainly answered doctor rowell
smiling what else can it be

  it is a knife faintly interposed ar-
nold

  did you see the blade entrefort
asked him quickly

  i did-for a moment

  entrefort shot a quick look at doctor
rowell and whispered then it is not
suicide doctor rowell looked puzzled
and said nothing

  i must disagree with you gentle-
men quietly remarked entrefort this
is not a knife he examined the handle
very narrowly not only was the blade
entirely concealed from view within ar-
nolds body but the blow had been so
strongly delivered that the skin was de-
pressed by the guard the fact that it
is not a knife presents a very curious se-
ries of facts and contingencies pursued
entrefort with amazing coolness some
of which are so far as i am informed
entirely novel in the history of surgery
a quizzical expression faintly amused
and manifestly interested was upon doc-


weird tales

tor rowells face what is the weapon
doctor he asked

   a stiletto

  arnold started doctor rowell appeared
confused i must confess he said my
ignorance of the differences among these
penetrating weapons whether dirks dag-
gers stilettos poniards or bowie-knives

  with the exception of the stiletto
explained entrefort all the weapons you
mention have one or two edges so that
in penetrating they cut their way a sti-
letto is round is ordinarily about half an
inch or less in diameter at the guard and
tapers to a sharp point it penetrates
solely by pushing the tissues aside in all
directions you will understand the im-
portance of that point

  doctor rowell nodded more deeply
interested than ever

  how do you know it is a stiletto doc-
tor entrefort i asked

  the cutting of these stones is the
work of italian lapidaries he said and
they were set in genoa notice too the
guard it is much broader and shorter
than the guard of an edged weapon in
fact it is nearly round this weapon is
about four hundred years old and would
be cheap at twenty thousand florins ob-
serve also the darkening color of your
friends breast in the immediate vicinity
of the guard this indicates that the tis-
sues have been bruised by the crowding
of the blade if  may use the term

  what has all this to do with me
asked the dying man

  perhaps a great deal perhaps noth-
ing it brings a single ray of hope into
your desperate condition

  arnolds eyes sparkled and he caught
his breath a tremor passed all through
him and i felt it in the band  was hold-
ing life was sweet to him then after

all-sweet to this wild daredevil who had
just faced death with such calmness
doctor rowell though showing no sign
of jealousy could not conceal a look of
incredulity

  with your permission said entre-
fort addressing arnold i will do what
i can to save your life

  you may said the poor boy

  but i shall have to hurt you

  well

  perhaps very much

  well

  and even if  succeed the chance is
one in a thousand you will never be a
sound man and a constant and terrible
danger will always be present

  well

  entrefort wrote a note and sent it away
in haste by a bellboy

  meanwhile he resumed your life
is in imminent danger from shock and
the end may come in a few minutes or
hours from that cause attend without
delay to whatever matters may require
settling and doctor rowell glancing at
that gentleman will give you something
to brace you up i speak frankly for i
see that you are a man of extraordinary
nerve am  right

  be perfectly candid said arnold

  doctor rowell evidently bewildered
by his cyclonic young associate wrote a
prescription which i sent by a boy to be
filled with unwise zeal i asked entre-
fort

  is there not danger of lockjaw

  no he replied there is not a suf-
ficiently extensive injury to peripheral
nerves to induce traumatic tetanus

   subsided doctor rowells medicine
came and i administered a dose the
physician and the surgeon then retired
the poor sufferer straightened up his
the permanent stiletto



business when it was done he asked
me	

  what is that crazy frenchman going
to do to me

   i have no idea be patient

in less than an hour they returned
bringing with them a keen-eyed tall
young man who had a number of tools
wrapped in an apron evidently he was
unused to such scenes for he became
deathly pale upon seeing the ghastly
spectacle on my bed with staring eyes
and open mouth he began to retreat to-
ward the door stammering

  i-i cant do it

  nonsense hippolyte dont be a
baby why man it is a case of life and
death

  but-look at his eyes he is dying
arnold smiled i am not dead
though he gasped

   i-i beg your pardon   said hippolyte
doctor entrefort gave the nervous man
a drink of brandy and then said

  no more nonsense my boy it must
be done gentlemen allow me to intro-
duce mr hippolyte one of the most
original ingenious and skilful machinists
in the country

  hippolyte being modest blushed as
he bowed in order to conceal his confu-
sion he unrolled his apron on die table
with considerable noise of rattling tools

  i have to make some preparations be-
fore you may begin hippolyte and i
want you to observe me that you may be-
come used not only to the sight of fresh
blood but also what is more trying the
odor of it

  hippolyte shivered entrefort opened
a case of surgical instruments

  now doctor the chloroform he
said to doctor rowell

   i will not take it promptly interposed
the sufferer i want to know when i
die

  very well said entrefort but you
have little nerve now to spare we may
try it without chloroform however it
will be better if you can do without try
your best to lie still while i cut

  what are you going to do asked
arnold

   save your life if possible

  how tell me all about it

  must you know

  yes

  very well then the point of die
stiletto has passed entirely through the
aorta which is the great vessel rising out
of the heart and carrying the aerated
blood to the arteries if i should withdraw
the weapon the blood would rush from
the two holes in the aorta and you would
soon be dead if the weapon had been a
knife the parted tissue would have
yielded and the blood would have been
forced out on either side of the blade and
would have caused death as it is not
a drop of blood has escaped from the
aorta into the thoracic cavity all that is
left for us to do then is to allow the sti-
letto to remain permanently in the aorta
many difficulties at once present them-
selves and i do not wonder at doctor
rowells look of surprize and incredul-
ity

  that gentleman smiled and shook his
head

  it is a desperate chance continued
entrefort and is a novel case in surgery
but it is the only chance the fact that
the weapon is a stiletto is the important
point-a stupid weapon but a blessing to
us now if the assassin had known more

she would have used-

  upon his employment of the noun


weird tales

assassin and the feminine pronoun
she both arnold and i started violent-
ly and i cried out to the man to stop

  let him proceed said arnold who
by a remarkable effort had calmed him-
self

   not if the subject is painful entre-
fort said

   it is not protested arnold why do
you think the blow was struck by a
woman

   because first no man capable of be-
ing an assassin would use so gaudy and
valuable a weapon second no man
would be so stupid as to carry so anti-
quated and inadequate a thing as a sti-
letto when that most murderous and
satisfactory of all penetrating and cutting
weapons the bowie-knife is available she
was a strong woman too for it requires a
good hand to drive a stiletto to the guard
even though it miss the sternum by a
hairs breadth and slip between the ribs
for the muscles here are hard and the
intercostal spaces narrow she was not
only a strong woman but a desperate one
also

  that will do said arnold he beck-
oned me to bend closer you must
watch this man he is too sharp he is
dangerous

  then resumed entrefort i shall
tell you what i intend to do there will
undoubtedly be inflammation of the aor-
ta which if it persist will cause a fatal
aneurism by a breaking down of the
aortal walls but we hope with the help
of your youth and health to check it

  another serious difficulty is this
with every inhalation the entire thorax
or bony structure of the chest consid-
erably expands the aorta remains sta-
tionary you will see therefore that as
your aorta and your breast are now held
in rigid relation to each other by the sti-

letto the chest with eviery inhalation
lulls the aorta forward out of place
about half an inch i am certain that it is
doing this because there is no indication
of an escape of arterial blood into the
thoracic cavity in other words the
mouths of the two aortal wounds have
seized upon the blade with a firm hold
and thus prevent it from slipping in and
out this is a very fortunate occurrence
but one which will cause pain for some
time the aorta you may understand
being made by the stiletto to move with
the breathing pulls the heart backward
and forward with every breath you take
but that organ though now undoubtedly
much surprized will accustom itself to its
new condition

  what i fear most however is the
formation of a clot around the blade
you see the presence of the blade in the
aorta has already reduced the blood-
carrying capacity of that vessel a clot
therefore need not be very large to stop
up the aorta and of course if that
should occur death would ensue but the
clot if one form may be dislodged and
driven forward in which event it may
lodge in any one of the numerous
branches from the aorta and produce re-
sults more or less serious possibly fatal
if for instance it should choke either the
right or the left carotid there would en-
sue atrophy of one side of the brain and
consequently paralysis of half the entire
body but it is possible that in time there
would come about a secondary circula-
tion from the other side of the brain and
thus restore a healthy condition or the
clot which in passing always from
larger arteries to smaller must unavoid-
ably find one not sufficiently large to
carry it and must lodge somewhere may
either necessitate amputation of one of
the four limbs or lodge itself so deep
the permanent stiletto



within the body that it can not be reached

with the knife you are beginning to

realize some of the dangers which await
    ii

you

  arnold smiled faintly

  but we shall do our best to prevent
the formation of a clot continued en-
trefort there are drugs which may be
used with effect

  are there more dangers

  many more some of the more serious
have not been mentioned one of these
is the probability of the aortal tissues
pressing upon the weapon relaxing their
hold and allowing the blade to slip that
would let out the blood and cause death
i am uncertain whether the hold is
now maintained by the pressure of the
tissues or die adhesive quality of the
serum which was set free by the puncture
i am convinced though that in either
event the hold is easily broken and that
it may give way at any moment for it is
under several kinds of strains every
time the heart contracts and crowds the
blood into the aorta the latter expands
a little and then contracts when the pres-
sure is removed any unusual exercise
or excitement produces stronger and
quicker heart-beats and increases the
strain on the adhesion of the aorta to the
weapon a fright fall a jump a blow
on the chest-any of these might so jar
the heart and aorta as to break the hold
entrefort stopped

  is that all asked arnold

  no but is not that enough

  more than enough said arnold
with a sudden and dangerous sparkle in
his eyes before any of us could think
the desperate fellow had seized the
handle of the stiletto with both hands in
a determined effort to withdraw it and
die i had had no time to order my fac-

ulties to the movement of a muscle when
entrefort with incredible alertness and
swiftness had arnolds wrists slowly
arnold relaxed his hold

  there now said entrefort sooth-
ingly that was a careless act and might
have broken the adhesion youll have
to be careful

  arnold looked at him with a curious
combination of expressions

  doctor entrefort he quietly re-
marked you are the devil

  bowing profoundly entrefort replied
you do me too greathonor then he
whispered to his patient if you do
that-with a motion toward the hilt-
i will have her hanged for murder
arnold started and choked and a look
of horror overspread his face he with-
drew his hands took one of mine in both
of his threw his arms upon the pillow
above his head and holding my hand
firmly said to entrefort

  proceed with your work

  come closer hippolyte said entre-
fort and observe narrowly will you
kindly assist me doctor rowell that
gentleman had sat in wondering silence

entre forts hand was quick and
sure and he used the knife with
marvelous dexterity first he made four
equidistant incisions outward from the
guard and just through the skin arnold
held his breath and ground his teeth at
the first cut but soon regained command
of himself each incision was about two
inches long hippolyte shuddered and
turned his head aside entrefort whom
nothing escaped exclaimed

  steady hippolyte observe
quickly was the skin peeled back to
the limit of the incisions this must have
been excruciatingly painful arnold


weird tales

groaned and his hands were moist and
cold down sank the knife into the flesh
from which the skin had been raised and
blood flowed freely doctor rowell
handled the sponge the keen knife
worked rapidly arnolds marvelous
nerve was breaking down he clutched
my hand fiercely his eyes danced his
mind was weakening almost in a mo-
ment the flesh had been cut away to the
bones which were now exposed-two
ribs and the sternum a few quick cuts
cleared the weapon between the guard
and the ribs

  to work hippolyte-be quick

  the machinist had evidently been
coached before he came with slender
long-fingered hands which trembled at
first he selected certain tools with nice
precision made some rapid measure-
ments of the weapon and of the cleared
space around it and began to adjust the
pans of a queer little machine arnold
watched him curiously

  what- he began to say but he

ceased a deeper pallor set on his face
his hands relaxed and his eyelids fell

  thank god exclaimed entrefort
he has fainted-he cant stop us now
quick hippolyte

   the machinist attached the queer little
machine to the handle of the weapon
seized the stiletto in his left hand and
with his right began a series of sharp
rapid movements backward and forward
hurry hippolyte urged entrefort
the metal is very hard

   is it cutting

   i cant see for the blood

  in another moment something snapped
hippolyte started he was very nervous
he removed the little machine

   the metal is very hard he said it
breaks the saws

  he adjusted another tiny saw and re-
sumed work after a little while he
picked up the handle of the stiletto and
laid it on the table he had cut it off
leaving the blade inside arnolds body

  good hippolyte exclaimed entre-
fort in a minute he had closed the
bright end of the blade from view by
drawing together the skin-flaps and sew-
ing them firmly

  arnold returned to consciousness and
glanced down at his breast he seemed
puzzled where is the weapon he
asked

  here is part of it answered entre-
fort holding up the handle

  and the blade-

  that is an irremovable part of your
internal machinery arnold was silent
it had to be cut off pursued entrefort
not only because it would be trouble-
some and an undesirable ornament but
also because it was advisable to remove
every possibility of its withdrawal ar-
nold said nothing here is a prescrip-
tion said entrefort take the medicine
as directed for the next five years without
fail

  what for i see that it contains mu-
riatic acid

   if necessary i will explain five years
from now

   if i live

   if you live

  arnold drew me down to him and
whispered tell her to fly at once this
man may make trouble for her

  was there ever a more generous fel-
low

	     

i thought that i recognized a thin
pale bright face among the passen-
gers who were leaving an australian
the permanent stiletto



steamer which had just arrived at san
francisco

   doctor entrefort i cried

   ah he said peering up into my face
and grasping my hand i know you now
but you have changed you remember
that i was called away immediately after
i had performed that crazy operation on
your friend i have spent the interven-
ing four years in india china tibet si-
beria the south seas and god knows
where not but wasnt that a most
absurd hare-brained experiment that i
tried on your friend still it was all that
could have been done i have dropped
all that nonsense long ago it is better
for more reasons than one to let them
die at once poor fellow he bore it so
bravely did he suffer much afterward
how long did he live a week-per-
haps a month

   he is alive yet

   what exclaimed entrefort startled
   he is indeed and is in this city
   incredible

   it is true you shall see him

  but tell me about him now cried
the surgeon his eager eyes glittering with
the peculiar light which i had seen in
them on the night of the operation has
he regularly taken the medicine which i
prescribed

  he has well the change in him
from what he was before the operation is
shocking imagine a young daredevil of
twenty-two who had no greater fear of
danger or death than of a cold now a
cringing cowering fellow apparently an
old man nursing his life with pitiful
tenderness fearful that at any moment
something may happen to break the hold
of his aorta-walls on the stiletto-blade a
confirmed hypochondriac peevish mel-
ancholic unhappy in the extreme he

keeps himself confined as closely as pos-
sible avoiding all excitement and exer-
cise and even reads nothing exciting
the constant danger has worn out the
last shred of his manhood and left him
a pitiful wreck can nothing be done for
him

  possibly but has he consulted no
physician

  none whatever he has been afraid

                               

that he might learn the worst

  let us find him at once ah here
comes my wife to meet me she arrived
by the other steamer 

  i recognized her immediately and was
overcome with astonishment

  charming woman said entrefort
youll like her we were married three
years ago at bombay she belongs to a
noble italian family and has travelled a
great deal

  he introduced us to my unspeak-
able relief she remembered neither my
name nor my face i must have appeared
odd to her but it was impossible for me
to be perfectly unconcerned we went
to arnolds rooms i with much dread
i left her in the reception room and took
entrefort within arnold was too great-
ly absorbed in his own troubles to be
dangerously excited by meeting entre-
fort whom he greeted with indifferent
hospitality

  but i heard a womans voice he
said it sounds- he checked him-
self and before i could intercept him he
had gone to the reception room and there
he stood face to face with the beautiful
adventuress-none other than entreforts
wife now-who wickedly desperate had
driven a stiletto into arnolds vitals in a
hotel four years before because he had
refused to marry her they recognized
each other instantly and both grew pale


weird tales

but she quicker witted recovered her
composure at once and advanced toward
him with a smile and an extended hand
he stepped back his face ghastly with
fear

  oh he gasped the excitement the
shock-it has made the blade slip out
the blood is pouring from the opening
-it burns-i am dying and he fell
into my arms and instantly expired

  the autopsy revealed the surprizing
fact that there was no blade in his thorax

at all it had been gradually consumed
by the muriatic acid which entrefort had
prescribed for that very purpose and the
perforations in the aorta had closed up
gradually with the wasting of the blade
and had been perfectly healed for a long
time all his vital organs were sound
my poor friend once so reckless and
brave had died simply of a childish and
groundless fear and the woman unwit-
tingly had accomplished her revenge

the curse of ximu-tal

               continued from page 

tains-and knoiv that you were not alone
eh that was the way it was with me
 wasnt alone not any longer some-
where in the shadows just out of reach
of my torch it was waiting for me i knew

  and all at once it came to me that the
room was no longer still i didnt know
what it was it sounded like the slow
running back of a wave over the pebbles
it was a sound that went with the smell
of the place a sound that whispered with
the voice of all the evil of thousands and
thousands of years

  the sound was all around me coming
in from the dark shadows of the walls i
blew my torch into flame half burned as
it was and held it high over my head
sparks dropping down on me like rain

  and i saw it all about the room
flowing over the stone floor like a green
river was the body of a snake i tell you
sir that snake was old big as my leg it
was thickening and pulsing and length-
ening out tightening and drawing closer
in to the coffin of ximu-tal and me mak-

ing a coil all the way around that room
i didnt see the snakes head at first off
in the shadows just that thick green
cable of a body as it pulsed and flowed

  i was weak as water i knew i was
done finished i knew that ximu-tals
snake was going to crush me against that
stone coffin just as he had crushed the
other white man i knew that my bones
were going to join his there on the floor
of the great room-when the snake was
done just like that other white man-
only there wasnt any mozo with me to
carry my canteen and gun back to his hut

  i hadnt thought of that gun before
i wouldnt have had the guts to get it out
now but my fingers were on that bit of
jade in my pocket that fighting elephant
it was like it was whispering to me tell-
ing me to fight i got the heavy gun in
my hand the snake was close now the
green folds two deep all around where i
stood backed up against old ximu-tals
coffin
weird tales

s

  and then i saw the head floating in
the air it was that head just like the
carved head in the chamber above close
the jaws were open and i could see that
fiery patch of red in its throat eyes of
jade above fire and ice and both wicked
as hell

t shot five times i shot straight at
a that hungry flaming throat i hit it
too god die anger of that snake writh-
ing smashing swinging-i tell you sir i
dont know how i got away ximu-tals
coffin went over wrecked with a crash
that shook the stone floor under my feet
something splintered like breaking glass
and a green spark flashed by me the
broken head of the jade snake even
then i felt bad to think of that beautiful
jade carving all broken and smashed

  i was in the passage ximu-tals great
snake coming after me blood dripping
from its angry jaws the gun was empty
the trigger clicked once twice on the
empty chamber and i threw the gun at
that bloody head i had nothing else
nothing but the stub of my burned-out
torch and i threw that back as i ran
threw it back like a crimson ribbon down
the black passage

  all the long way up i could hear
ximu-tals snake coming like the flowing
of water over pebbles and i ran god
how i ran i threw off my coat my gun
belt i tell you sir i was afraid as i
never had been afraid before

  i ran up through the dark up into
that chamber with the carved snake of
ximu-tal running about it the carved
head ready to strike i thought it would
strike i could not stir the carven stone
of the floor i ran on feeling with my
hands along the wall for that blessed way
out finding it and scrambling up the dug
passage bumping my head stumbling

weird tales

all the time hearing behind me the dread-
ful flowing of the angry snake

   i tell you sir i was desperate it was
terrible the soft pressing darkness that
held me back as i ran and behind me
closer and closer the coming of that
great green snake of ximu-tals all this
time i had in my hand that tiny piece of
jade the carven elephant fighting the
serpent i did not know that i held it i
do not know sir how it found its way to
my fingers but i held it and now i
turned and threw it i threw it with all
my strength into the thick darkness where
the old priests snake was coming

  it was then my shoulder in the dark-
ness hit the stake that other man had put
in the passage to prop up the rock in the
roof i struck it and knocked it down
with the weight of my body i was run-
ning and i was afraid and i hit it hard

the stake came down and i fell over it

  behind me just at my feet the big
rock fell down from the roof and like
water the little rocks and sand flowed
after it faster and faster the sand
poured over my feet as i lay there
trembling

  no sir i do not know how i got out
of there i do not know how i got out of
that dead city where warfare had been
between ximu-tal of the snake and the
priests of the elephant i do not know
how long i wandered in the jungle until
i came to the plantation they did not
believe me when i told of the snake-of
the two snakes-of ximu-tal

   jade is an evil thing i tell you sir it
holds all the wickedness of all the ages
since it was made in the furnaces of those
evil priests of the lost atlantis but id
like to see that great carved piece again

the hills of the dead

             continued from page 

strife he halted frozen down the
slope the black horde was fleeing and
over their heads and close at their shoul-
ders flew huge vultures tearing and
rending avidly sinking their beaks in the
dead black flesh devouring the vampires
as they fled

  kane laughed almost insanely

  defy man and god but you may not
deceive the vultures sons of satan they
know whether a man be alive or dead

  nlonga stood like a prophet on the
pinnacle and the great black birds soared
and wheeled about him his arms still
waved and his voice still wailed out
across the hills and over the skylines
they came hordes on endless hordes-
vultures vultures vultures come to the

feast so long denied them they black-
ened the sky with their numbers blotted
out the sun a strange darkness fell on
the land they settled in long dusky
lines diving into the caverns with a whir
of wings and a clash of beaks their
talons tore at the black horrors which
these caves disgorged

  now all the vampires were fleeing to
their city the vengeance held back for
ages had come down on them and their
last hope was the heavy walls which had
kept back the desperate human foes
under those crumbling roofs they might
find shelter and nlonga watched them
stream into the city and he laughed until
the crags re-echoed

  now all were in and the birds settled
weird tales



like a cloud over the doomed city perch-
ing in solid rows along the walls sharp-
ening their beaks and claws on the
towers

 and nlonga struck flint and steel to a
bundle of dry leaves he had brought with
him the bundle leaped into instant
flame and he straightened and flung the
blazing thing far out over the cliffs it
fell like a meteor to the plateau beneath
showering sparks the tall grass of the
plateau leaped aflame

  from the silent city beneath them fear
flowed in unseen waves like a white fog
kane smiled grimly

  the grass is sere and brittle from the
drouth he said there has been even
less rain than usual this season it will
hum swiftly

  like a crimson serpent the fire ran
through the high dead grass it spread
and it spread and kane standing high
above yet felt the fearful intensity of the
hundreds of red eyes which watched from
the stone city

  now the scarlet snake had reached the
walls and was rearing as if to coil and
writhe over them the vultures rose on
heavily flapping wings and soared re-
luctantly a vagrant gust of wind
whipped the blaze about and drove it in
a long red sheet around the wall now
the city was hemmed in on all sides by
a solid barricade of flame the roar came
up to the two men on the high crag

  sparks flew across the wall lighting in
the high grass in the streets a score of
flames leaped up and grew with terrifying
speed a veil of red cloaked streets and
buildings and through this crimson
whirling mist kane and nlonga saw
hundreds of black shapes scamper and
writhe to vanish suddenly in red bursts
of flame there rose an intolerable scent
of decayed flesh burning

weird tales

  kane gazed awed this was truly a
hell on earth as in a nightmare he
looked into the roaring red cauldron
where black inseas fought against their
doom and perished the flames leaped a
hundred feet in air and suddenly above
their roar sounded one bestial inhuman
scream like a shriek from across nameless
gulfs of cosmic space as one vampire
dying broke the chains of silence which
had held him for untold centuries high
and haunting it rose the death cry of a
vanishing race

  then the flames dropped suddenly
the conflagration had been a typical grass
fire short and fierce now the plateau
showed a blackened expanse and the city
a charred and smoking mass of crumbling
stone not one corpse lay in view not
even a charred bone above all whirled
the dark swarms of the vultures but they
too were beginning to scatter

  kane gazed hungrily at the clean blue
sky like a strong sea wind clearing a
fog of horror was the sight to him from
somewhere sounded the faint and far-off
roaring of a distant lion the vultures
were flapping away in black straggling
lines

                        

 palaver set

kane sat in the mouth of the cave
 where zunna lay submitting to the
fetish-mans bandaging

  the puritans garments hung in tatters
about his frame his limbs and breast
were deeply gashed and darkly bruised
but he had had no mortal wound in that
deathly fight on the cliff

  mighty men we be declared
nlonga with deep approval vampire
city be silent now sure nough no walk-
ing dead man live along these hills

  i do not understand said kane

resting chin on hand tell me nlonga
how have you done things how talked
you with me in my dreams how came
you into the body of kran and how sum-
moned you the vultures

  my blood-brother said nlonga
discarding his pride in his pidgin eng-
lish to drop into the river language un-
derstood by kane i am so old that you
would call me a liar if i told you my age
all my life i have worked magic sitting
first at the feet of mighty ju-ju men of
the south and the east then i was a slave
to the buckra - the white man - and
learned more my brother shall i span
all these years in a moment and make
you understand with a word what has
taken me so long to learn i could not
even make you understand how these
vampires have kept their bodies from de-
cay by drinking the lives of men

  i sleep and my spirit goes out over
the jungle and the rivers to talk with die
sleeping spirits of my friends there is
a mighty magic on the voodoo staff i
gave you-a magic out of the old land
which draws my ghost to it as a white
mans magnet draws metal

  kane listened unspeaking seeing for
the first time in nlongas glittering eyes
something stronger and deeper thanthe
avid gleam of the worker in black magic
to kane it seemed almost as if he looked
into the far-seeing and mystic eyes of a
prophet of old

  i spoke to you in dreams nlonga
went on and i made a deep sleep come
over the souls of kran and of zunna
and remove them to a far dim land
whence they shall soon return unremem-
bering all things bow to magic blood-
brother and beasts and birds obey the
master words i worked strong voodoo
vulture-magic and the flying people of
the air gathered at my call
weird tales



   these things i know and am a part of
 but how shall i tell you of them blood-
 brother you are a mighty warrior but in
 the ways of magic you are as a little child
 lost and what has taken me long dark
 years to know i may not divulge to you
 so you would understand my friend
 you think only of bad spirits but were
 my magic always bad should i not take
 this fine young body in place of my old
 wrinkled one and keep it but kran
 shall have his body back safely

   keep the voodoo staff blood brother
 it has mighty power against all sorcerers
 and serpents and evil things now i re-
 turn to the village on the coast where my
 true body sleeps and what of you my
 blood-brother

   kane pointed silently eastward

   the call grows no weaker i go
 nlonga nodded held out his hand
 kane grasped it the mystical expression
 had gone from the dusky face and the
 eyes twinkled snakily with a sort of rep-
 tilian mirth

   me go now blood-brother said the
 fetish-man returning to his beloved jar-
 gon of which knowledge he was prouder
 than all his conjuring tricks you take
 care-that one fellow jungle she pluck
 your bones yet remember that voodoo
 stave brother ai ya palaver set

   he fell back on the sand and kane
 - saw the keen sly expression of nlonga
 fading from the face of kran his flesh
 crawled again somewhere back on the
 slave coast the body of nlonga with-
 ered and wrinkled was stirring in the
 ju-ju hut was rising as if from a deep
 sleep kane shuddered

   kran sat up yawned stretched and
 smiled beside him the girl zunna rose
 rubbing her eyes

   master said kran apologetically

stumbled away from the buildings and
down toward the islands shore thin curls
of smoke lifted from the two structures
they reached the shore of the island op
posite that where russell had first landed
and there was the long boathouse with
still upon its door the lock that garland j
had placed there they crashed into
it and in moments had the cabin-boat out
and heading with noisy motor away from
the island

   clouds of dark smoke were lifting sky
ward from the islands higher center as
the flames ate the two buildings there
the sunsets level rays struck in vain
against their black and billowing masses
snelling held the boat westward away
from the island lowerman and hall and
johnson sprawled in its cockpit wallace
pointed back with unsteady hand to the
lifting smoke-clouds as he and russell
gazed

  there never were any of garlands
compounds-never any pigmies that he
made with them from men he said
never anything but an accidental ere
that caught garland you understand

  russell nodded weakly better so
he whispered better that the world
hear it so-

  he crouched with wallace looking
back still the island was dropping be-
hind vanishing in the waters but the
smoke from- it rose visible still into the
heavens like a great black column an
enormous sign their eyes could mark
it still though the island itself had
passed from sight snelling though had
not turned had not looked heading die
boat straight onward into the setting sun

night she had been awakened by
