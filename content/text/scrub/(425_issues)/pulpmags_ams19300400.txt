the universe wreckers by edmond
hamilton a serial in  parts part i we are in-
clined to take everything for granted-particularly
the courses of nature there is after all no abso-
lute assurance that the sun for instance should
continue indefinitely to turn at its present speed
what would be the final result of the centrifugal
force if the sun started to turn more and more
rapidly what would happen to the planets
which rotate around this great luminary mr
hamilton needs no introduction but we do want
to say that this surpasses the best interplanetary
story by him that we have yet published read
the first instalment in the may issue

madness of the dust by r f starzl al-
though this story was written some time ago an
extract taken from the new york times of
december   gives almost word for word a
similar description of an operation performed by a
ships captain following radio instructions from a
physician how then can we say anything is im-
possible but this is only an incident in an un-
usual story excellently told and which contains
a good bit of science

the ivy war by david h keller md here
is a new story by dr keller based on the always
interesting subject of botany dealing with a sub-
ject that is little known as yet the ivy war
goes on in the good old keller manner which
some of our readers seemed to have missed re-
cently it is absorbingly interesting and plausible
withal

synthetic by charles cloukey by this time
mr cloukey has become a familiar and well-liked
author in amazing stories in this story he
offers us an exceedingly clever swift-moving avi-
ation exploit of the future that shows good imagin-
ation and excellent knowledge of his subject

natural sources of power

                      by t oconor sloane ph d

the great watershed which supplies the lake region of
america beginning with lake ontario and extending
to the west end of lake superior represents if we take
it in one unit one of the biggest in land or seas of all
the world all the water from this great watershed
which reaches the eastern end of lake erie falls in one mighty
cataract over niagara falls there is an enormous evaporation
from these lakes but a very large fraction of the water which
falls into them goes in one concentrated mass-or let us say two
concentrated masses-over the precipice of niagara the canadian
falls and the american falls separated by goat island to the
engineer it represents nothing more nor less than a wonderful
source of water power to him its scenic value means nothing
he is apt to forget that this very scenic value has brought
millions of dollars from visitors to the region in the past century
-for tourists and the proverbial wedding couples have visited
niagara in enormous numbers but the engineer would take
away all the water would run it through tunnels drive turbines
with it and use it for the production of power

  many years ago it was considered a crime to charge interest
for money it was called usury the idea of course was that
money did not suffer in use if you loaned a man  shillings
for instance when it was returned you got  shillings back
none the worse for wear but now money has a definite value
for its use money now makes money and the money which
does your earning is given the name of capital and this capital
plays a very curious part in evaluating natural sources of power
wind or water yet it may be made the servant of man for the
production of the same amount of power a hydro plant may cost
a great deal more than a steam plant would cost for the devel-
opment of the same quantity of power units the water-power
plant it may be said uses up nothing because the water is sup-
plied from natural sources it is drawn up by the heat of the
sun precipitated in regions distant from the water-power station
pours down over the watersheds through all the streams and
rivers and reaches at last the desired place and there develops
power we may say for nothing-at least for nothing as far as
the consumption of the water is concerned but there is a very
heavy cost in interest on the capital that would have to be
invested in the plant

  in very many places-perhaps in the majority of cases-a steam
jilant although it uses up coal and demands constant labor to
care for the machinery to do the firing under the boilers-all
more pro rata than is required in a hydro plant-yet it saves on
tiie interest of the money invested because this money is much
less than the cost of the corresponding water plant this is not
universal but it occurs frequently enough to make it a recognized
fact that steam power driven by coal mined and dragged up
from the bowels of the earth fired by hand or by automatic

stokers is really cheaper than where nature hands us over all the
power we want in the shape of flowing water such as we see at
niagara falls or in nearly as impressive a way in the rapids of
the st lawrence river

  in other words that mighty watershed could give us any
number of power stations but the power stations would prob-
ably cost so much that steam power would be cheaper

  going down the st lawrence river from niagara falls to
quebec the great rapids which drive down through the wide
channel with such resistless force offer an opportunity for any
number of power stations thus in a sense the water from the
great lakes can be used over and over again if we go to the
head of lake michigan at chicago there we find some of the
water diverted from its proper course and discharged into the
head waters of the mississippi river running down to the gulf
of mexico instead of taking its proper course to the gulf of the
st lawrence here too a hydraulic power station could be
placed which would give a practicable amount of power

  we are constantly hearing of different chances for the estab-
lishment of power plants driven by water and all sorts of claims
are made that these should not be monopolized by private com-
panies  that they should be for the service of the people and be
tinder government ownership government ownership generally
turns out to be a very expensive luxury but that of course is
a side issue the fact remains that proper steam plants in many
cases are cheaper to run than are hydro plants because of the
diminished capital required in many cases often to secure water
power an enormously expensive dam must be built and that is
only the beginning of things because the power plant itself with
turbines and electric generators in its interest on the capital costs
far more than the coal which would be consumed by a steam
plant of equal power

  natural sources of power of enormous amount in the aggre-
gate are being discarded or what is not quite as bad are not be-
ing utilized the power of the wind which brought columbus to
america is now being used less and less steamships and motor-
driven vessels are sent across the ocean and no consideration is
applied to the wind and while there may be a gale blowing behind
them which certainly would add to their speed it is not thought
worth while to provide the plant in the shape of masts and sails
to utilize this power windmills which at one time were rela-
tively speaking quite numerous in holland and in england and
of which there are many in america they too have been put
into the discard to a great extent but wind and water are only
two of the natural powers which man has found it apparently ex-
pedient to neglect natural powers are waiting for us all over
the earth but presumably will hardly ever be used to any extent
as long as coal and oil are as abundant as they are today


the metal horde

by john w campbell jr

author of when the atoms failed

      pphaj with calculating machines and robots and now perhaps even mechan-
      ical airplane pilots there seems no limit to the possibilities in the realm
      of working machinery we have seismographs that can locate the place of dis-
      tant earthquakes and machines that can solve in a comparatively short period
      problems in the higher calculus that would otherwise take brilliant mathemati-
      cians an endless time to do it seems to us quite logical that machines might
      some day perhaps in the distant future be developed to solve for our scientists
      now apparently insoluble problems or they might even be made to state their
      own problems and work them out-in other words it might some day be pos-
      sible to have a machine with almost a working brain according to our author
      this will be possible and his final explanation of his idea is exceedingly clever and
      novel there is no question mr campbell knows his science and he has by this
      time proved his ability to weave a great deal of sound science into an absorbing
      scientific fiction story of exceeding plausibility

illustrated by de pauw

it would seem lack of generalship that permitted
them to be discovered so soon for had we not
picked up those signals from the ether we should
not have received that warning that meant so
much to us and it might well have been that this
system would have acquired a new population for it
would have needed but little to shift the balance the
other way once i watched steven waterson save
the civilization of the earth but now i saw him in a
greater role for it was he who made possible the defeat
of the sirians but even had his brilliant mind succeeded
in working out the problem of the de-activating field
without the precious hours gained by that warning many
millions more would have died before they could have
escaped from mars

  i was in his laboratory at the time he received the
messages from the system government telling the im-
port of those strange tone-signals out there ip space i
seem fated to be with that man every time some great
event breaks on the system i was with him when dr
downey announced his discovery of the secret of old
age-or better its prevention waterson was forty-
two now in years but in body he was still twenty-eight
for it was late in  that he had taken dr downeys
treatment

  those strange tone-signals had been heard faintly for
days but it was not until july th  that they were
located in space and then man began to realize something
of the message they might bear

  waterson asked me to accompany him to the system
capital on venus and i was present at that first cabinet
meeting and at each succeeding meeting again i was
close to the facts-and again waterson has asked me to
write a chronicle of that terrible war

  it was not till the signals had definitely been located as
originating far out in space that man began to take more
than a mildly curious interest in them they were com-
ing from the metal horde that was even then sweeping
across space at a thousand miles a second to the planets
ahead

  their goal of ages was in sight sixteen hundred years
of ceaseless rushing flight had at last brought them near

  when our ancestors were beginning to grumble under
their roman lords in the time of horlak san when his
mighty armies were sweeping their way across mars
under the newly developed heat rays spreading death
and civilization at one time that menace started on its
expedition

  when the normans invaded england when the
mighty empire that the san dynasty had maintained over
all mars was crumbling that journey was half done

  when columbus first set foot on the shores of
america when koral nas formed the great union of the
federated nations of mars that trip was three-quarters
done

  but it was seven-eighths completed when mars de-
veloped the first crude atomic engines and when priestly
of england discovered oxygen and during the two
 the great sphere arid its attendant transports sank gently to the ground and formed a
vast wheel with the sphere as the hub and the transports as radiating spokes and the rim




amazing stories

centuries of flight that remained before they reached
their goal there developed on those tiny planets the in-
struments that were to throw that mighty force down to
defeat

  but i am to tell you of that war as i saw it we have
till seen it-all too closely it was really but a little more
than a month that that menace of metal hung over us
there on mars but to us it seemed years except to the
frantically working scientists striving desperately to
discover some weapon to defeat them david gale

a tiny glistening mote in space it was as it sped
toward the shining planet before it-the rapid
flight of the car aided by the gravity of venus the call
had been urgent and the earth had been in superior con-
junction that meant a full twenty-hour trip even at
 miles a second but now they were approaching the
planet and the pilot was losing speed as rapidly as pos-
sible there was a limit to what he could stand though
and it took him many thousands of miles to bring the ma-
chine down to a speed compatible with atmospheric con-
ditions of the planet

  tlie air of the planet seemed thick with traffic mighty
half-million ton lift freighters and passenger ships set-
ting out toward earth smaller private machines but
none were slower nor faster than the others for all were
limited only by the acceleration they could stand there
was only one speed limit that of economical safe oper-
ation for with all space to move in there was no need
of speed laws yet it seemed impossible to make any
more than two thousand miles an hour through this slow
moving air traffic-then there shone a little emblem on
the bow of the little iridescent metal ship and a huge
freighter swerved respectfully aside as by magic a
lane opened through the thick traffic as the sign of the
system president shone out

  the little ship darted along the ground a short way
then rose vertically only to settle lightly on the roof of
the great system capitol two men came out and
walked quickly to the elevator entrance where three
guards armed with disintegration ray projectors greeted
them with a stiffly military salute the larger of the
men responded with a smile and a brief salutation in the
common language of the system for these great men
were martians each well over eight feet tall they en-
tered the lift and quickly sank down one hundred and
fifty stories to the governmental offices they proceed-
ed directly to the great cabinet chamber down through
the long halls lined on each side by huge murals de-
picting scenes in the history of the three planets then
they came to the cabinet room and entered

  thirty-nine men were seated there now but as the two
entered they rose and waited for the president to be
seated the forty greatest living men were in that
room that day and all worked together for they were
scientists who had learned the value of cooperation
there was  rivalry for each was the greatest in his
own field and had no aspirations toward any other
branch of science and none but conceded the power
of the presidency gladly to the greatest of them steven
waterson of earth

  gentlemen of the cabinet i am beginning to believe
it is time we had something added to the constitution
forbidding members of the cabinet to rise on the entry
of the president waterson deeply appreciated that
compliment as they all knew but he could not feel at

home in an atmosphere of diffidence he was a scientist
a planner not a diplomat i am sorry i was forced to
make you gentlemen wait for me but as you see he
continued pointing to the great map of the system on
the ceiling of the cabinet chamber where the slow mo-
tion of the planets in their orbits was being accurately
traced earth is in superior conjunction at present and
i could not make better time

  i see from this memorandum that has been prepared
for me that mansol korac martian astro-physicist is
to be our first speaker i take it you have had no offi-
cial discussion as yet

  he was correct in this assumption for the men had
convened shortly before at his radio announcement that
he would land within an hour

  some years before there had been some agitation to
have the cabinet meetings carried on by radio-vision
plates but the low speed of light had made the speeches
a terrible failure as they would frequently have to wait
ten or even fifteen minutes while the radio messages
were reaching them over short distances that method
was practicable but between planets light is too slow
it cannot be used

  some time ago our radio engineers developed a new
instrument for detecting exceptionally short waves they
really came under the category of the longer heat radi-
ations but were detected electrically while experi-
menting with this device they have been consistently
picking up signals apparently originating in free space
at first these signals were exceedingly weak but their
intensity has grown uniformly and rapidly and from
the results some amazing conclusions have been drawn

  they are originating at some source or sources out
in space in the direction of the sun sirius i was asked
to help the radiation engineers under horus mai in the
calculation of the astro-physical aspect of the problem
i believe that there are some man-made vehicles out
there in space sending those signals no man of the
system has ever had reason to venture beyond the orbit
of neptune for any great distance there would be no
reason for it as none of the outer planets are habitable
the rate of increase of the signal strength coupled with
observations made from earth mars and venus have
made it evident that they are at present about one and
a quarter billion miles away but approaching us at the
rate of  miles a second this means that in ap-
proximately two weeks they will reach our planets

as to their point of origin we can only make guesses
-ty really they are coming toward us with sirius-
and thousands of other stars-at their back of all
sirius is the nearest being approximately nine light
years away this means that they must have spent at
least  years on that trip across space dr james
downey of earth has recently shown us how to lengthen
life almost indefinitely so the problem of old age need
not be considered a supply of air and water would of
course be no great problem with the waterson apparatus
for electrolyzing co back to carbon and oxygen using
atomic energy fuel water of course is merely trans
muted and recombined and thus automatically purified
for use a sufficient reserve of very dense materials
could easily be carried that would make up for any losses
by transmutation to the necessary gases as yet we
have not been able to make foods from energy carbon
and oxygen and hydrogen but i believe you dr lange
the metal horde



have made very considerable progress along that line
have you not

  i intended announcing at this meeting said dr
lange the development of a commercial method of
manufacturing any one of the sugars and several pro-
teins directly from rock or water by a transmutation
and building-up process the method has been de-
veloped

  then continued the martian there would be no
need of carrying any great amount of food that
problem is settled

   as there would be no resistance encountered in space
once the machine had been accelerated to its definite
speed of  miles per second on leaving sirius it
would be able to make the trip across space with no ex-
penditure of energy until it reached its goal and slowed
down to the speed of a planet hence no great amount
of matter-fuel would be needed to drive the machine

  but the problem of heating seems to me to be in-
soluble interplanetary space we have the radiations
of the sun to depend upon and they are decidedly suffi-
cient usually superfluously so but in the infinite depths
of interstellar space there is only darkness and a perfect
reservoir for radiations there would be continuous
cooling by radiation and no sun to warm the ship i
could understand how the ship might carry enough
matter to warm it for one hundred years but in sixteen
hundred years so much energy must be radiated that the
entire mass would not suffice nothing short of an
entire planet would be sufficient polished walls would
reduce the radiation but still it would be too high i
can not understand it-unless these men can endure a
temperature of but twenty or thirty degrees above ab-
solute zero-then they could make it quite readily-but
two hundred and forty degrees below zero centigrade
means that air-nearly everything would be solid ex-
cept a few rare gases no it seems impossible-yet we
have the evidence i can not understand how they have
made this terrible migration but i know that there are
many different units i believe two thousand or more
was the number you mentioned horus mai 

   there seem to be a very considerable number of sep-
arate signals that we can distinguish i consider the two
thousand a very conservative estimate replied horus
mai the martian radiation engineer

  then continued mansol korac we must decide
 some plan of meeting them

  the martian sat down and for some time there was
silence in the great hall at last president waterson
rose slowly to his feet his face showed his concern
in times of emergency he always felt that these men
here were responsible for the welfare of the twenty bil-
lions of human beings they controlled and he was
their leader and therefore the responsibility was his

   mansol korac could you point out to us the approxi-
mate location of the approaching ships asked water-
son and handed him a small hand light and pointed to
the great map of the system above them

   i cannot be very exact mr president i do not know
their location very definitely but i should say about here
proceeding thus the dazzling beam of white light
stabbed up to the ceiling high above and a sharp circle
of light a foot across appeared just within the orbit of
uranus but well beyond saturn then it slowly moved
inward toward tiny glowing mars they were within
the solar system but had not yet reached the inner

ring of planets doubtless they who could make a
trip across the great void had the energy of matter at
their disposal and probably the disintegration ray they
would have no difficulty with the planetoids they could
merely beam them out of existence if they came too near

   the light snapped out and each member of the cabinet
turned toward waterson again

   gentlemen we see that they are within the solar
system already and appear toi be heading directly for
the inner ring and mars in particular i do not know
whether they come in peace or as invaders but i think i
can reasonably say that they are probably invaders
we all agree that they have made a trip of some 
years duration we all recognize the difficulty of such
a trip there are over two thousand ships in their fleet
i would not send so large a fleet to investigate the outer
ring but to send that great number of ships on a mere
exploration trip of  years-i do not think it is
consistent then too we must allow them a life span
of over three thousand years if we are going to padmit
that this fleet is for exploration for it would be three
thousand two hundred years before they could bring
back news of their trip in the meantime they might
well have been wiped out by some stellar catastrophe
or they might have developed means of seeing us directly
in nine years the time light takes for the trip much as
we would prefer peace i fear we must prepare for
war but we can always go out to meet them peace-
fully in a great battle fleet that might convince them
that it is better to deal peaceably with us and it would
at least be a protection i suggest that we have a dis-
cussion on this and take a vote

   but there was no discussion and the vote was unani-
mous for the presidents suggestion was the logical
thing they had to be prepared for either peace or war

   then came the discussion of weapons there was
pitifully little to discuss the interplanetary patrol fleet
was a mere police force designed to destroy meteors
turn comets or asteroids there was no real naval fleet
but mechanical devices had reached a great peak of per-
fection and the little space ships were so cheap so easily
operated and so eminently safe that nearly every family
had several and new ones were always in demand
there were mighty factories to meet this demand
twenty billion people can absorb a tremendous number
of machines that was the greatest protection we had
and it was that quantity production developed by the
american ford that made watersons campaign pos-
sible but we were to learn much of quantity production
methods before that war was over

rders were issued that evening to all the great
v- plants over all three planets to begin work on a
great quantity of ten-man-high speed ships they were
to be arranged with mountings for machine guns firing
explosive bullets loaded with material explosive each
one equal to  tons of the old fashioned dynamite
with special mountings for dis ray machines the dis-
integration ray machinery was to be built by the com-
panies employed ordinarily in making private power
plants hand lights and the jumping belts these belts
had small projectors that threw a directional beam of
force that tended to deform the curvature of space at
that point and the result was a force that pulled the pro-
jector forward for the space before it acted like a spring
if a magnet be held near a steel watch spring the spring

will bend but it will try to straighten out and pull the
magnet forward if the magnet could pass through the
spring it would progess as the space curver apparatus
was pulled through space this was the principle of
every ship now built from these tiny two-kilogram
nearly live pounds machines capable of lifting a man
into the air to the titanic new passenger-freight liners
carrying as high as three quarters of a million tons

  the principle of the disintegration ray was not greatly
different and so the machines designed for turning these
out in quantities were used to make the dis ray appara-
tus with no great changes

  the heat ray projectors were made in quantities for
every purpose they were used for cooking for welding
metals for warming the home for melting down cliffs
to make way for a building or a tunnel for water for
heating the mighty space ships for anything to which
heat might be applied to advantage these would make
very effective weapons but for the fact that heat rays
could be reflected they would bounce off the car of
the enemy without doing any damage if it were polished
as no doubt it would be

  great liners of space were requisitioned and fitted with
dis rays and with mighty attractor beam apparatus that
would grip and hold anything short of another liner
each of the ten-man-cruisers had a smaller attractor
beam by which they could grip an adversary and hold
to his tail with the tenacious grip of a bulldog and yet
not weary the pilot with violent movement these ships
were exceedingly powerful and their speed was limited
only by the accelerations the passengers could stand

  but all the scientists of the system were working
desperately to design some new weapon some new ma-
chine that was a little faster a little more powerful
although with resistance in space and with the tremendous
energies of matter at their disposal there was little lack
of power as far as the speed of the ships were concerned
ten thousand times more powerful than the titanic en-
ergies of atoms this energy had defeated the martians
that memorable day in may  and it was a full ten
billion times more powerful than the energies of coal
of oil of the fuels man had known before that day
but they needed a machine that could project the dis
ray farther twenty-five miles was the limit beyond
that the tremendous electrical field that was used to
direct it must be built up to so high a voltage that there
was no practical way of insulating it they must be
satisfied with the twenty-five mile range-but the scien-
tists were working at increasing the range

  they had two weeks before the sirians would reach
mars and in those two weeks much was done there
was a very carefully laid out system in all notices the
absolute truth was laid before the public but there was
also laid before them the evidences of mans power
there were no panics this was no weird thing to them
the landing of a fleet from another world it was as
commonplace to them as the landing of a fleet from the
other side of the ocean had been a generation ago the
element of the unfamiliar was gone and with it had gone
the element that produces panic that reduces the effi-
ciency of a nation or of a system

  new production machines had to be built new de-
signs worked out new dies cut but it was done with
the quickness that a generation of mass production had
made possible it was not new to them this change of
design overnight

  it required most of those two precious weeks to get
the great machines working once more at their tasks
but at last a steady stream of ten-man cruisers was be-
ing poured out  an hour night and day from the
factories of three planets but there was only one day
to work before the invaders would reach mars and the
fleet was gathered  ten-man ships manned by
the volunteers of three worlds

  but in the meantime waterson had had built for him-
self a ten-man ship with triple strength of walls and
triple power plant installation and an extra energy gen-
erator he was experimenting with it no one knew on
what

   at last the invaders were seen far out in their course
the scouts had met them those scouts were destroyed
without provocation they did not even have time to
finish their reports but we learned enough

  mars was a deserted planet now all its population
had moved to the other worlds most of them moved
to earth on the other side of the sun only the workers
in the great factories remained they were not com-
pelled to they were told of the danger of their posi-
tion but those factories could contribute  ships an
hour and they were manned the fleet had gathered on
mars awaiting the news of the sirians when the re-
port of the scouts was flashed across the ether

  they told of a great horde of metal ships shining
iridescent ranging in size from tiny darting machines
ten feet long by one and three-quarters in diameter mere
torpedoes to great transport ships and there was a
single spherical ship a great sphere that floated in the
center of a bodyguard of the thousands of its followers
there were literally hundreds of thousands of the little
torpedo-ships a few dozen of the cargo ships and a few
ships that seemed more like scouts of some sort but
it was apparent that the little torpedo-ships were the real
fighters-tiny ships that spun and turned and darted
like an electron in ionized gas it seemed impossible that
a man could stand those sudden turns at several miles
a second but they watched them and went into nothing-
ness as the dis ray reached out from those tiny ships and
caressed their ships

  they too had dis rays-it would be a terrible
battle for man had that same force a force so deadly
they had feared to use it in industry but man had the
advantage of numbers

  the men on the fleet who saw those television plates
glowing with the story of what was taking place out
there in space decided that those torpedo-ships must be
guided by radio if they were it would be a simple
matter to wreck that system by using a powerful inter-
ference that wold drown out the directing wave and
make its ships unmanageable

  the system capital was temporarily moved to the
waterson laboratories on earth there the forty men
had gathered around great television plates and were
watching the battle of the scouts they were not to go
to that battle front the system needed them

it was midnight on the part of mars where the siriacs
first struck the fleet of the solar system was massed
there to meet them they seemed headed for the mighty
gleaming city of metal below dornalus the second
city of old mars was there and they seemed bent on
reaching it as the sirians drew near they threw for-
ward a great shield of the torpedo-ships then the great
the metal horde



generators on the solarian fleet forced tremendous
etheric currents into space and waited to see the motions
of the tiny ships become erratic but they darted about
as steadily as easily as ever these sirians must be
small men and they must be from a massive world
a work that had accustomed them to great accelera-
tions

  below them the city was deserted except for vision
projector machines that hummed steadily automatically
from a thousand points they were broadcasting the
message to the worlds and to the commanding officers
on the other side of mars these men had direct con-
trol of the battle they could not control it from earth
for radio waves travel too slowly twenty minutes each
way the waves took and in forty minutes the battle was
more than over it lasted only fifteen minutes-minutes
of terrific carnage

   as the two great fleets came into contact the solarians
drove into the mass of tiny ships their dis rays flashing
in every direction they had one advantage in that
they sprayed nine streams of death from each of their
craft but the torpedo-ships were so unbelievably fast
that it was nearly impossible to hit them and they
seemed to have no compunction about raying one of their
own ships if a more than equal amount of damage was
inflicted on their enemies logical no doubt but how
inhuman

   the sky above the city became a blazing hell of dis
rays heat rays and exploding shells the explosives
were not safe for they threw great flying fragments that
could pierce the wall of a ship and send it down they
damaged friend and foe alike

   the solarian fleet had a solid projectile of a single
giant crystal of copper that was immune to the dis ray
it could penetrate the walls of a ship and bring it down
but the explosive bombs were more often than not ex-
ploded or merely disintegrated before they reached their
goal a crystal of any sort was immune to the dis ray
but it was not a protection against it there was no
known way of deflecting the dis ray except by that
special electrical field that directed it and that could not
be made to surround a ship the copper crystals were
used mainly to destroy the dis ray projectors of the
enemy they were fired at the faint glow and with luck
they would hit the machine and instantly wreck the pro-
jector more than one machine disappeared as its own
dis ray projector wrecked by the fifteen-inch copper
crystal suddenly spread in all directions

  the sphere and its escort of transports hung back
surrounded by a great number of the torpedo ships
they did not join in the fight

 and at last the solarian fleet was recalled it was not
right that they should make such heavy sacrifices the
city must fall and it would be easy to crush the sirians
with a larger fleet at the rate of  solarian ships an
hour they might well do so in three days so the sola-
rians left and behind on the ground there were a few
ships a great number had been rayed into nothingness
the sirians had won this first victory but the solarians
could soon make up for this loss they had twenty
billions to back them up and they had the resources of
three planets it seemed as though the invaders could
not last long but we had yet to learn the true meaning
of mass production

  no man could hang around the encampment of that
alien race but above them television broadcasts were

suspended and some were installed in the buildings of
the city but these were of no avail for the sirians
seemed obsessed with the idea of making mars a true
sphere they proceeded to level the great city with dis
rays no news projector could remain there of course
and several news projector men lost their lives it was
foolhardy to stay in that city they had been forbidden
but nothing will keep a newsman out of a chance for a
scoop the projectors which hung above continued to
show a weird sccne

  the great sphere and its attendant transports sank
gently to the ground and formed a great wheel with the
sphere as the hub and the transports as radiating spokes
and the rim high above them the darting torpedo-ships
were wheeling in constant circles it seems a miracle
that not all of those news projectors were destroyed but
some did last till the early rays of the sun set them off
as shining targets for the flashing dis rays it was a
weird scene they showed

   now from the sides of the great transports came not
men but great machines machines that lumbered along
on caterpillar treads to set themselves down beside their
parent ship one from each ship and proceeded to dig
themselves in about three feet deep then all seemed
quiet except for a steady hum from the great machines
fifty-eight in all there were great machines-fully two-
hundred feet on a side they worked there quietly now
and the men within them must have been totally covered
for they could not be seen apparently the sirians dared
not come out into the martian atmosphere and now
something was happening that startled all the billions of
watchers on the three planets in the top of the great
machines was a small trapdoor through this there
came a torpedo-ship that floated up a few feet then
darted off to join the wheeling machines above then
eleven seconds later another came forth-another-each
machine there was sending them out now one by one
those machines released a torpedo-boat-one every eleven
seconds with the regularity of a clock

   at first men could not grasp the significance of this-
but soon it became obvious these wonderful machines
were complete factories in themselves portable mass
production factories for producing those torpedo-ships
and one each eleven seconds came from the end of
the production line complete the noises there were no
longer a gentle hum there was a whir and rattle of
machines it was not loud though considering the mighty
works that must have been going on inside but stead-
ily now that darting fleet of torpedo-ships was increasing
the power for all this work was obvious to these men
who used similar processes in their work

  from the soil below them the machines dug masses
of matter and carrying it up into the machine trans-
muted its elements into the elements necessary to their
machines then molded them and automatically assem-
bled them it would require very little supervision but
that production rate was staggering one each eleven
seconds meant  completed machines an hour

   there were no signs of any men entering these ships
or the machines so it seemed there must be some means
of distant control that man knew nothing of for it was
improbable that all those men could have been in the
parent machine from the beginning no wonder the
sirians could lose these machines so freely the ability
to make them automatically from anything meant they
cost practically nothing and could be produced in limit-


amazing stories

less quantity the notion that man was to be an easy
victor was fast disappearing these machines were
coming to form an ever-growing cloud of wheeling ships
still man had destroyed fully half their fleet in that des-
perate struggle they must spend some time in making
up those losses but man had lost nearly a third of his
great fleet four hundred thousand brave men had been
lost it was not even a victory and it had cost man far
more than it had cost the sirians they had learned
something from them though perhaps radio control
would enable man to do an equal amount of damage
orders were put through to make an experimental fleet
of thirty thousand radio-controlled machines

in the meantime a new thing was attracting the atten-
tion of the people on the planets a new set of
machines was issuing from the transports these were
smaller than that first set-low and squat-but they
seemed far more flexible in their movement they went
off in orderly line to a point a few miles distant from the
main encampment and there formed themselves into
two groups one group remained still but began to
glow faintly and a hum came to the televisors above
then there began to flow from a spout on the side of
each a steady stream of molten metal this was poured
into a somewhat similiar arrangement on the other
group then these moved quickly away and with their
strange handlike appendages began to work quickly
at a great rounded hull that was rapidly forming the
men watching understood it was to be another cargo
ship rapidly this hull grew under their swift manipu-
lation till it was completed in three and a half hours
an entire ship except for the machinery was completed
and now they began to work on another and as they fell
to work there started from the original cargo shops a
long line of small quick moving machines machines
that could run along the ground or drive through the air
and they were covered with arm-like appendages soon
these reached the newly built hull and quickly they were
at work getting material from the strange squat ma-
chines entering the hull and working at it the second
hull was nearly completed when one of the smaller ma-
chines flew back to the original encampment and went
up to the sphere from it it drew a strange metal case
oblong from which led a great heavy cable this it
carried back to the now completed ship and installed it
somewhere inside then the ship rose easily from the
ground and floated around a bit landed again and im-
mediately there came out of it one of the torpedo-ship
machines none of these had gone in it had been made
by those slim quick worker machines and now there
lumbered out a second machine-one of the strange
hull maker machines-then two of the worker machines
came out where only one had gone in the ship was
complete even to its strange crew and now that strange
crew was already at work making others

   with the coming of dawn the televisors were rayed
out of existence but that evening more were installed
and every night during all that invasion there floated
above them those noiseless televisors they destroyed
many but many remained

   that night showed us a fleet of nearly a half million of
the tiny torpedo-ships and a rapidly growing cargo ship
camp there were more than a hundred now for as
each was completed the machines made could aid in
the more rapid construction of the next

  and that night they began their work of leveling
mars that great fleet spread itself out over all the sur-
face of mars and with flaming heat rays and the terrible
dis rays they cut down every remnant of the martian
hills twenty-four hours later the entire planet was one
vast featureless plain and on that plain there had been
established eight camps during this time the cargo
ships had been moving and during that twenty-four
hours they did nothing but man was prepared the
radio-controlled fleet was ready to be given its first try

  the entire fleet was assembled above the surface of
mars above that original camp where still rested the
one sphere then from far out in space the great con-
trol ships directed the dive of the radio-control-ships
making the distance one-twentieth part of a light second
the men directing the ships were no faster than that
could not respond sooner and the greater distance gave
them greater safety

  but now the radio-controlled ships were released and
permitted to drop uncontrolled they wished to give
the sirians no warning then when the ships were
scarcely ten miles from the sirian fleet they were
brought under control headed nose down in a power
dive straight through the surprised upper layers of the
fleet and with dis rays glowing they drove straight for
the ships below suddenly there were great gashes in
the ground beneath and twenty of the cargo ships were
gone in that first rush and three more followed quickly
but while literally thousands of the sirian torpedo-ships
had been rayed nearly half of the thirty thousand radio-
controlled ships of man were gone and now they had to
apply full power to prevent striking the ground but
twenty-two of them continuedon in straight fall toward
the great sphere they were rayed by a hundred ships
before they could get really separated from their com-
panions and now the fast radio ships were destroy-
ing hundreds of the sirians they were formed in a verti-
cal column reaching up ten miles one above the other
with the nine dis ray projectors going full blast and
spinning as rapidly as was safe lest the machines fly
apart due to centrifugal force for the dis ray will work
practically instantaneously the top ship was prevent-
ing the torpedo-ships attack from above suddenly each
of the ships stopped spinning its dis ray went out and
they dropped like rocks the radio control had been
drowned out by powerful interference they were no
longer under the influence of the men and they had
ceased to function the radio-controlled-ships would no
longer be useful against the sirians

nearly the entire fleet of the sirian torpedo-ships
had been wiped out by that spinning column now
thousands of the manually-controlled ships dove down
at the weakened fleet every one of the remaining
ships shot up to meet the advancing fleet there were
still several thousand of the torpedo ships and now the
sphere rose with them and among them suddenly the
entire mass came together in the shape of a greater
sphere with walls of torpedo-ships and as it formed the
torpedo ships snapped on their dis rays and started the
entire surface of the sphere spinning they seemed
invulnerable in this formation but they quickly moved
away across the surface of the planet the larger part
of the solarian fleet following wondering what to do
about it it seemed impossible to attack the sphere of
destruction
the metal horde



   but the cargo ships were left unprotected and in a
moment they had been beamed out of existence the
sirians had lost many hours work on this battle and
they lost more before the mighty fleet of torpedo-ships
from the other camps rescued them for now and then
an explosive shell would penetrate the screen of disinte-
gration rays but within the outer shield was a second
virtually a shield of metal for the metal sphere was sur-
rounded by a solid mass of the torpedo-ships but many
of these were destroyed more too were put out of com-
mission by the copper crystals

   on the arrival of the great fleet from the other camps
the tables were turned the control ships had too low
an acceleration and there were too many ships for the
ten-man machines to get though they tried to make a
screen of dis rays that stopped the ships till they were
rayed out of existence many of the control ships were
lost and many of the ten-man ships

   it was then that waterson announced two things that
gave the solarians new hope

   it was the fifth of august when the announcement
was made and it was the same day on which nearly
the entire fleet from all the camps on mars started off
for venus but the movement was detected almost at
once and from great underground bases on mars the
solarian fleet sent out fifty thousand ten-man ships
these ships skimmed along close to the ground and
their polished metal had been sprayed with a drab paint
so that they seemed but shadows that became practically
invisible as they sped along widely separated but rapidly
converging on the site of the spheres camp this had
remained on mars guarded by so small a number of
ships that it was evident they expected the solarian
fleet to go to venus as no doubt would have been
necessary but for this swift counter raid

   so perfectly camouflaged were the solarian ships
that they got within ten miles of the camp without being
discovered then as their dis rays flashed out the
entire group of the torpedo ships dove on them there
were nearly one hundred thousand of the ten-man ships
diving down at them in a zigzag course that made them
impossible targets but the fleet had been approaching
from all sides and now the entire sirian defense was
concentrating on the machines attacking from the north
those from the south crept in behind them and sud-
denly the sphere started into the air then went flying
out into space at terrific speed it barely escaped the
dis rays of the attackers only its tremendous accelera-
tion saved it now several thousand of the torpedo ships
shot after it the rest falling into the form of a great disc
to block the path of the pursuers man had long been
accustomed to two dimensional maneuvering but the
ease with which these sirians fell into complex three
dimensional formations showed long practice in the
art of warfare in space

   that raid was successful in that it forced the imme-
diate return of the sirian fleet and very nearly de-
stroyed the sphere over seventy-two thousand of the
torpedo ships were destroyed but we lost two thousand
twenty thousand men but waterson an-
nounced that the sirians would no longer be able to
escape because of their greater acceleration he had
discovered a method for using an attractor beam of a
short range but considerable power to be used with an
electro-magnetic device that would automatically turn
on the instruments in such a way that no matter what

the accelerations might be no matter how great as long
as they were within the limits of the ships strength
the accelerations and centrifugal forces would be in-
stantly neutralized thus making possible violent maneu-
vers that the sudden forces had hitherto made impossible
a demonstration of his new ship had confirmed it he
took up a number of the cabinet in his special machine
and turned hairpin turns at ten miles a second the ac-
celeration would have been instantaneously deadly had
those neutralizers failed they might as well have been
under a half million ton freighter as it landed as un-
dergo those accelerations but in that perfectly balanced
room it was not detectable the ships hull was made
triple strength as were the power projectors and the
generators it was powered like a freighter and could
reach its full speed of  miles per second at an ac-
celeration  times that of earths gravity waterson
who weighed two hundred and ten pounds on earth
would have weighed over five tons it meant that the
solarian fleet would no longer be handicapped by the
greater flexibility of the enemy ships the plants that
had been manufacturing the machines had already closed
down temporarily while the dies for these new machines
were being made but within thirty-six hours the first
of the machines was being turned out

  and now a great crew of young men were being
gathered to man them they were all volunteers there
were to be one million ships and that meant ten million
men would be needed only modern methods could
have made that possible but with three populations
totaling over twenty billions a sufficient number of
volunteers came forward to make the work easy as fast
as these men came to the conscription stations they
were put into the new machines and here also modern
methods had helped the waterson system of material
energy release had been so successful that the price of a
completed car had dropped to well under one hundred
dollars for the small two-man machines and even for
the interplanetary models not more than two thousand
dollars needed to be paid for the raw materials were
absolutely free the labor was mechanically reduced to
almost nothing and as the energy that drove these ma-
chines was as cheap as the raw materials they merely
charged enough to make the venture pay a decent return
on investment and to pay the wages of the few machine
supervisors and the office staff men worked five days
a week on three-hour shifts in the factories but longer
hours and more pay went to the builders to the men who
had to manually control the building construction ma-
chinery for law forbade the building of offices on the
mass production scheme since that meant an unvaried
monotonous city but everywhere wages were high for
wages depend not on the amount of work men do but
on the amount of finished product they can turn out
the men accomplished more and were paid more but
they worked less it had taken many years to finally
convince the earth of that but the example of american
labor with its shorter hours and higher wages was proof
enough and then the influence of the mighty energies
waterson had released made it even more apparent
mars had already developed the system under the force
of the released atomic energies

  high wages and cheap machines had meant that every-
one owned one and so absolutely safe were they that
they commanded perfect confidence this had been a
big factor in the making of this mighty fleet every-


amazing stories

one knew how to operate the machines so it was easy
to fill the places on the machines with pilots

  nevertheless special training was necessary to over-
come the caution against quick turns that long experi-
ence had instilled in them all each accepted applicant
was taken tip in one of the new machines and given a
breath-taking ride-a ride that consisted in diving to-
ward the earth with terrific sudden acceleration then
just when the student felt certain they would crash and
become a mass of molten metal the ship was brought
up not a mile from the ground to settle gently then
when they almost touched the ground they leapt into
the air again with an acceleration that shot them out
of the atmosphere with the velocity of a meteor while
the outer wall of tungsto-iridium alloy glowed cherry
red then came sharp turns at ten or twenty miles a
second till at last the students no longer gripped the
arms of their seats in anticipation of a sudden accelera-
tion then they were taken down and given a ship to
experiment with

  but none of these men had ever handled a weapon
of the sort they were to use so mimic battle practice
was held with the glowing rays of a harmless ionizing
beam instead of the deadly dis rays

daily reports were coming from the martian scouts
as time went on the sirians too had decided
to do some fleet building for nearly three-quarters of
their fleet had been destroyed the production rate of
mans factories  a day had gained a slight lead
it would require ten days before a fleet of a million
could leave for mars with a home guard of two-hundred
thousand ships

  the destruction of the martian plants had lowered
the production rate to about  an hour but shops
put up rapidly on earth and venus had quickly brought
the production-rate back and it would be nearer 
an hour by the time the last of the fleet had been finished

  the spinning sphere formation of the sirians had been
almost invulnerable and an exceedingly destructive
formation the solarians had chosen several thousand
of their crack pilots to practice this maneuver but de-
spite almost constant practice during the entire ten days
it was a miserable failure as soon as they tried to
progress standing motionless it was a very effective
procedure but the spinning column was decided on as
more effective as long as they had no ship to protect
there were twenty groups that practiced that maneuver

  and then waterson announced that an associate of
his working in his laboratory had developed a method
for using a triple electrical field to direct the dis ray
making possible a ray with a range of over sixty miles
this would be absolutely fatal to the spinning sphere
system of the sirians the sirians very evidently did
not know how to project the dis ray any further than
twenty-five miles the ability to stand off and hit them
would break down the sphere of dis rays very quickly
there was only one objection the rays were very
powerful so powerful that they required triple power
generators but the special field of electrical force was
the worst problem the field could not be made suf-
ficiently strong if a single layer of the force was used
but the invention of a method to back up the first with
two other layers of equal voltage thus getting nearly
three times the effect without exceeding the capacity of
the insulation had made the new machine possible this

special field was produced by circularly moving cathode
rays or exceedingly high velocity electrons and there-
fore could be produced only by atomic methods this
meant ten thousand times the amount of fuel a simi-
larly powered material engine would have required
but material energy of course yields only wave motions
of the transient or unstatic type a type that cannot
stand still atomic energy can yield static-waves as well
as unstatic the electron can stand still and is a perfect
example of the stationary wave

  these limitations in turn meant that a tremendous
weight of equipment was needed and a corresponding
great volume of space was required in the end they
had to use specially reinforced freighters to carry the
great projectors each of which could carry but two
projectors due to their long range however the ships
were at least self-protecting there was not time to
make and equip more than twenty-eight of these ships
before the fleet was scheduled to start they were com-
pleted ahead of time some of their trial trips more
than fulfilled the best hopes of the inventor dr wil-
liam carson the physicist who developed it insisted that
it was really dr watersons suggestions that made the
thing possible

  we had learned something of spatial warfare forma-
tions from the sirians now we were to learn a bit of
the strategy of spatial warfare

the solarian fleet sailed for mars on the fifteenth
of august  they were a scant twenty mil-
lion miles from their goal when a report came from a
scout that something was happening down in the sirian
camp almost immediately after that the sirians flooded
our entire system with so terrific a barrage of radio
frequency static that communication was impossible
they could not transmit from earth to venus and the
communication was very poor even from one side of
earth to the other despite the fact that over a half
billion kilowatts were used so intense was this barrage
that if two of the torpedo ships near the sending ap-
paratus came within twenty or thirty feet of each other
great crashing sparks leapt across and instantly they
were fused scouts saw this happen twice

  the solarian fleet continued on for mars they
should cover the remaining distance-twenty million
miles-in five hours by pressing the ships a little al-
though higher speeds made the rate of approach of
asteroids so great that they frequently could not be
detected before they collided with the ships

  only two and a half hours later a scout came into
sight at terrific speed he must have been doing over
two thousand a second an exceedingly dangerous rate-
but his acceleration neutralizer enabled him to slow down
safely he reported that the entire sirian fleet had risen
from mars leaving a very few machines behind-this
time taking the sphere with them-and had set out for
earth earth was on the other side of the sun-a long
two hundred and twenty million miles to go the
sirians had a lead of three hours they had as great a
speed as the solarians and would reach earth bef -rfhe
solarians but they would at least be delayed by the
two hundred thousand ships-more now for the steady
production would have built the quota up to over six
hundred thousand or a million by the time they could
return the sirian fleet had been built up to nearly three
million though which could easily crush the fleet of a
the metal horde



million and the second million later-separately the
trip would take them sixty-two hours scouts had been
sent ahead to earth at a dangerously high speed to com-
municate the news and the entire fleet had increased
its speed to a rate that was considerably higher than
safety warranted but a continuous play of dis rays
was considered sufficient safety at fifteen hundred miles
a second the sirian fleet had been reported to be
making thirteen hundred and fifty so the solarians
should pass them or meet them just shy of the earth
where the other fleet would be waiting they should
have no difficulty to crush the invaders with the two
million ships

  the radio interference was being maintained by a
ship anchored somewhere in space it was no doubt well
protected and to attack it successfully would have meant
the loss of a large number of ships for the time spent
in the attack would delay them irreparably they must
continue to earth

   there were no scouts from the sirian fleet-yet there
should have been for over a thousand ships had been
following them far behind none ever reached earth
to warn the fleet every one of them was destroyed
but when the sirian fleet was well on its way-it
turned-and headed for venus they had purposely
let that one scout reach the solarian fleet with the news
that the fleet was headed for earth-then they redirected
their course the scouts from the solarian fleet did
reach earth-but soon after the last of the scouts fol-
lowing the sirian fleet had been destroyed their radio
barrage was lifted all the ships on venus were con-
centrated on earth and venus was left unprotected

  twenty hours after the fleet had turned back the
radio barrage was again lowered over the system it
was ten hours later that the sirians reached venus

  while the radio barrage had been lifted waterson
had had an idea that there should be some protection
for the planet it did not seem that the planet should
be completely stripped of its defenses and he had sug-
gested that at every city great dis ray machines of the
sixty-mile range type be set up his suggestion was
followed and at every city on venus the great machines
were installed there were many of them now for
during the hundred hours the main fleet was in flight
the new machines had been put on a quantity produc-
tion basis but all the ships that were equipped with
them were sent to the defense of the unattacked earth
and it was those machines that prevented the landing
of the sirians they came to the night side of the
planet of course coming from mars it would be thirty
hours before they would be expected on earth-thirty
hours before the main fleet would reach the planet-
and then there would be the -mile trip to
venus if they were to get there in time to rescue the
planet

  but the sirians could not approach within beaming
distance of the cities and all those that did try to do so
were brought down as a cloud of powdery dust it was
watersons caution that saved the billions of people on
venus

   but were they to be saved  the sirians decided they
must destroy the works and the people on venus so
they made one desperate effort they had at least sixty
hours to work in and now they had a plan that would
require time they retired some hundred miles from the
planet then the entire fleet torpedo ships cargo boats

and the entire body guard of the sphere lined up and
then switched on powerful attractor beams imme-
diately the combined effect of over three million of these
emanations took hold on the planet and great tides
began to rise in its mighty oceans many lives were
lost in the seaside towns when the tremendous waves
rushed in over the land but astronomers on the planet
and most of the systems scientists were there to watch
the sirians on mars through their great telescopes and
these astronomers saw what the sirians intended and
saw that they were well on their way to fulfilling
their aim

  a planet is balanced in its orbit about its parent
 sun with the delicacy of a diamond on a jewelers
 scales but like the diamond if it be displaced by some
 force it reaches a new state of equilibrium thus if
 the diamond is further lowered in the scale by adding a
 small weight it soon reaches a new point of equilibrium
 no conceivable force therefore could be great enough
 to displace the planet in its orbit more than a few million
 miles by pulling it either in toward the sun or out from
 it and as soon as that force was released it would spring
 back to its original position as the diamond would regain
 its balance on removing the disturbing weight for the
 sun pulls on a planet with a titanic force it draws it in
 with the apparent force gravity and another similar
 but opposite force centrifugal force of its revolution in
 its orbit is constantly tending to throw it into the depths
 of space these are the two forces that are always bal-
 anced suppose the planet is drawn nearer the sun it
 revolves in a smaller orbit - and it revolves in that
 smaller orbit with a higher speed-for it has fallen in
 toward the sun it has gained speed as any falling body
 would it has gained speed in the direction of the sun
 but this has operated to increase its rotational speed
 thus it has gained a greater centrifugal force-you can
 see the effect with a bit of chalk on the end of a string
 the smaller the circle it swings in the greater the ten-
 dency to fly outward but as long as we continue the
 force that was added to draw it in it will remain in
 equilibrium remove this extra force and at once the
 planet will fall away from the sun losing speed as it
 does so till it has reached a point where it is once more
 in equilibrium with the force drawing it inward

  now reverse the problem let us draw it away from
 the sun now the orbit is longer and it has lost speed
 in moving from the sun it cannot stay here it is not in
 equilibrium unless the force that drew it out is main-
 tained to free the planet from the sun one would have
 to lift hundreds of quintillions of tons of rock through
 billions of miles against the terrific gravity of the sun
 it is too much

  thus we see that as long as the planet revolves in its
 orbit it will never fall and to pull it away from the
 sun is impossible as long as it revolves in its orbit but
 if it slows down in its flight about the sun it at once has
 less centrifugal force it automatically falls toward the
 sun until it has gained velocity enough to establish a
 new orbit of equilibrium if this energy too is with-
 drawn  if it is made to stand still in its orbit it will fall
 straight to the sun it is the only way such a thing
 might be done and it would take the energies of matter
 and strain that to the utmost to accomplish it

  this was the plan of the sirians three million ships
 were dragging like a titanic brake on the planet as it


amazing stories

 wheeled in its orbit and slowly steadily it was falling
 into the blazing furnace of the sun their ships were
 not designed for this task but they could do it in the
 sixty hours at their disposal in a short time it would
 be falling directly toward the sun but it would take
 many hours for the seventy-million-mile fall even if it
 were stopped before it reached the sun any place within
 twenty million miles would be unbearable

  it was the distressed planet itself that warned the
people on earth and the men of the fleet that the sirians
would never reach earth for the radio was still dead
but the fleet turned for venus at once they were far
to one side of the path to venus and they would have
to turn but it would take them thirty instead of sixty
hours to reach venus and the other fleet was coming
from earth they were not quite a million strong but
those machines that had been produced on venus would
come also and that would bring the total numbers up
to over a million and with the main fleet the number
would be well over two million there were also three
hundred of the long range dis ray ships now for many
more had been produced and venus would supply an
equal number

we can only admire the wise action of the com-
mandant of the venerean fleet mals hotark in
not sending his pitiful fleet of a few thousand out to
fight with the sirians the members wanted to the
people of venus wanted him to but he wisely waited
until he saw the fleets of the system approaching it
would have done no good and lost many lives and
valuable ships to have gone in advance to the attack

  many people tried to leave venus but enough ma-
chines were freed of the task of stopping the orbital
motion of the planet to patrol the heavens and keep the
people from leaving they beamed thousands of private
cars out of existence it seemed unnecessarily cruel

   the two great fleets were drawing nearer to the planet
converging and at last they got so close that they could
carry on a radio communication by using the terrific
power of over two billion kilowatts of energy the
amount of power that sirian machine was throwing off
has been estimated at a minimum of fifty billion kilo-
watts we know that enough power could be picked
up from a hundred meter aerial on earth to operate a
small high frequency motor

  when radio communication was established they
agreed to wait until they could join for the fleet from
earth was two hours ahead of the main fleet the loss
of time was made up for in greater efficiency of action
they would need it all at last they joined fleets one
mighty disc of two million airships they flew on through
space at a steady rate of five and three-quarter million
miles an hour they arranged themselves in a mighty
cone as they came nearer venus already the machines
had slowed it down so greatly that the planet was over
a million miles out of her orbit and rapidly adding to
this mileage

  but now as the great cone approached the great ships
with the long range dis rays leading they were dis-
covered the cone formation was chosen for that is
the three dimensional equivalent of the two dimensional
v that man had used in war on earth for thousands
of years

  now began the greatest battle in the history of the
system here were two mighty forces slashing at each

other with terrific disintegration rays fighting in the
great void and five million powerful ships darting
around slashing stabbing with a death that struck with
the quickness of light

  as the great cone of the main fleet attacked from one
side there was a smaller cone attacking the sirians from
the other but long before the sirians could bring their
rays into effect the long range rays had torn great holes
in their ranks the sphere had retired with its escort
at once going swiftly to mars the main fleet was too
busily engaged in fighting the sirians main fleet to
worry about the sphere at present

  a dozen times the great spinning sphere formation
was tried by the sirians but each time a withering blast
of the long range dis ray cut it up as a tool held against
a spinning block of wood cuts it down in the lathe
their strongest formation was useless and they could
no longer outmaneuver the solarians the new ships
could turn and dart as quickly as they or even more
quickly the big dis ray ships were not equipped for
fast fighting so when there were none of the spinning
sphere formations to break up they retired to a safe
distance and waited for any ships that might attack
them few did it proved suicidal but steadily the
forces of man were conquering in a hell of flashing
dis rays the new ships were proving their worth the
flaming rays had seared the land below for many miles
but the fleet of the sirians was fast going the new
fast ships of man could dodge the rays of the sirians
turn and dart on the tail of their attacker then hang
there the attractor beam giving them an added grip
until they could flash the machine into nothingness with
the dis ray they turned ducked darted ahead with
terrific speed suddenly stopped and then were going
full speed again and another sirian ship was gone
now it was the delicate apparatus of the sirians ships
that suffered they could not keep up with the sudden
turns of this flexible adversary and their great fleet
had been reduced to a scant quarter million but we had
lost nearly a half million ships five million men in that
titanic struggle such a battle cotdd not last long it
was impossible nothing could stand before the dis
rays and with those turning darting ships sooner or
or later every ship must come under the influence of
those rays but now the last of the torpedo-ships were
fleeing into space but we did not care to have to fight
them again-and they too were rayed out of being
they could no longer dart away from us before we
could catch them-that was for us now

  but now the fleet returned to a greater task venus
had been falling toward the sun and was nearly a mil-
lion and a quarter miles off and within her orbit now
a great fleet of cargo carriers from mars venus and
earth came up and with them came wrecker ships
capable of picking up  their powerful attractor beams
an entire million-ton passenger-freight liner-great liners
themselves all equipped with attractor beams soon
they were all using their power to bring the planet back
to its normal speed it did not take the ships of that
mighty fleet many specially designed for heavy listing
and towing many designed for tremendous loads very
long to bring the planet back to its age-old orbit

  in former days we would have found a world wrecked
by panic bulthis later generation had learned to trust
in the powers of the ships they had and there had been
little of the terrible panic that would have affected the
the metal horde



world of a generation ago then too they knew that
with the demonstrated power of the long range dis rays
they could safely convoy a fleet of the great passenger
liners to safety

  what helped also was the fact that the human mind
cannot grasp the full significance of the fall into the
sun if you were told that the planet you were on was
sinking toward the sun you would be surprised horri-
fied and would probably try to make a bargain-buy on
real estate while the other man sold his to get his money
out you would simply fail to comprehend the magni-
tude of the catastrophe it has never happened and
never will the mind says and we unconsciously believe
it your neighbor would joke about it to you of course
many would leave but most people would stay till the
actual physical heat of the sun drove them off we are
constituted that way

  but now the radio barrier was down and news from
the martian scouts made men hesitate the remaining
cargo ships had settled on mars and were even now
pouring out their strange crews but they were not
building cargo ships every one of the worker machines
were kept in action constructing duplicates of themselves
as rapidly as possible already a great number of them
had been made-over seven hundred of the machines it
was estimated-and now these were engaged in similar
work the number grew in a steady geometrical series

  but the scouts were driven away by the torpedo ships
then there was no news of the operations until night-
fall permitted the scouts to creep up and install the usual
floating vision machines

  then at last we understood the reason for this tre-
mendous number of inoffensive worker machines there
was a great seething mass of metal around the workings
now great blazing lights illuminated the scene as
brightly as day there was a great horde of shining
metal machines working swiftly about the great plain
there seemed to be thousands of them now and they
were all busily at work on great machines-the torpedo-
ship machines there must have been nearly a thou-
sand already completed and already the fleet that had
escaped had been built up to many thousands by the
rapidly working machines and a steady stream of long
glistening shapes rose-only to be lost in the darkness
beyond steadily the great machines were being put to-
gether and steadily the great fleet was being augmented

  before morning that fleet had reached two hundred
thousand and was now growing at the rate of twenty-
five thousand an hour steadily this rate was increasing
the fleet was too large to be attacked by mans weakened
fleet for the delay in putting venus back in its orbit
had given the sirians a chance to build up an invulner-
able fleet the added time of the trip to mars meant a
still greater fleet already their production rate was far
greater than mans man could not hope to compete
successfully we were learning the meaning of quantity
production

  had it been possible to attack them with the long
range dis rays it would have been tried but the plan
was hopeless before the fleet could reach them there
would be  miles to go to reach them and it
would take approximately twenty hours in which time
at the present rate of increase the sirian fleet would
have reached a total of three million again they would
all concentrate their attack on the long range dis ray
ships no solarian ships could help without interfering

with the action of the dis ray ships and they would
need help for each ship carried only two beams more
could not be carried they would merely be held at bay
unable to attack their goal useful only in breaking up
the spinning sphere formation but that could be pre-
vented the solarians had learned that trick from the
sirians the sirians had succeeded in breaking up every
spinning column formation by simply getting into the
midst of it before it was formed completely it required
perfect coordination of several machines to do it but
it was always done the long range dis rays were excel-
lent now in defending a city but useless for attack be-
cause of the terrific weight of the apparatus they could
not attack the sirian fleet if they did the production
machines would have been so built up by the time they
reached the planet that any ordinary rate of destruction
would be easily equaled by the production within
three days it was decided that the sirian fleet would be
built up enough to attack they would then attack our
planets no doubt

a cabinet meeting was called at the waterson
laboratories on earth there waterson first dem-
onstrated the weapon that finally conquered in the ter-
rific struggle before the members on the cabinet table
was a small portable material energy disintegrator a ma-
chine that gave off its energy as light there was a
second machine at the other end of the table a machine
that occupied about two cubic feet of space and on
one side of it was a small switch and a dial on the other
was a familiar looking projector

  dr waterson spoke

  gentlemen of the cabinet i have here a new ma-
chine that my laboratory has developed i will demon-
strate its action first the light was switched on throw-
ing a brilliant shaft of light against the ceiling then
waterson snapped on the switch of the new machine
and there appeared a strange beam of blueish ionized
air but unlike any other known ionizing beam it was
shot through with streamers of red fire long hair-thin
streamers that wavered and flickered in the blue tube of
the ionized air it reached out touched the light gen-
erator and passed on through a series of plates of dif-
ferent materials but the instant that strange beam
struck the light-machine it went out then a moment
later when the new machine was turned off the light
snapped back on

  gentlemen this machine will produce a field direc-
tional in this case that will so modify the properties of
space as to make it utterly impossible to disintegrate
matter into energy there is some tendency to fix energy
as matter i think that will be interesting to us in the
event that this war is successfully concluded but at
present we are interested in the properties of the beam
in that it will stop the disintegration of matter the
process depends on the modification of the properties
of space it is well known that in ordinary space such
as we know there are twenty coefficients of curvature
in ordinary empty space ten of these have zero values
and the ten principal coefficients have certain non-zero
values this machine so affects space that it makes all
the coefficients of space have non-zero values and fixes
these values to suit its own purposes the results are
amazing i have done some things with this machine
that makes me truly afraid but we are interested in it
because certain of the values we can assign operate to


amazing stories

force space to take such curvatures that any change
of the condition of matter to condition of energy is
impossible on release of the ray the space returns to
its normal curvature

  working out the theory of this machine has been a
tremendous task even the great calculating machine
the new integraph developed last year and it is a far
cry from that first one that m i t developed in 
required many weeks of work to solve the problem in
twenty coefficients of space in so doing at one stage
we had to assume a space of twenty dimensions in order
that the correct values in the four true dimensions might
be determined

  but there is still a great deal of work to be done
we must develop practical machines of a range of many
miles there is no difficulty in using the ray since as
it is a condition of space not a vibration it is impossible
to stop it by any shield there is only one way to work
with it to create it directionally we make the field by
projecting certain strains along a beam then once started
the field follows that line to a distance dependent on the
strength of the generator

  but this will require at least five days to get into
working form i suggest that in the meantime venus
makes several million of the long range dis ray projec-
tors and distribute them all over the planet to be turned
on from a central station or by their own separate
crews i have no doubt that the sirians will attack that
planet before we are ready to attack them earth too
must be prepared but in the meantime we can begin
the work on the new de-activating field projectors as i
call them

  waterson was right it was three days later that the
sirian fleet left for venus with a number of torpedo
ships so tremendous it is absolutely inconceivable
there were over two hundred million of the ten-man ma-
chines when they started to settle about venus the
sky was so filled with them that it was literally dark for
many miles they attacked at horacoles the system
capital but the fields of the great dis rays were too
much for them neither bombs nor dis rays could reach
through the air was dense and filled with artificial
smoke to prevent the transmission of heat rays and
great winds were created for the purpose of carrying
the heat away but this was done automatically by the
expanding air before long they could not attack the
city all over the face of the planet were the great dis
ray emplacements great ships hung even over the great
rolling oceans sending the blue rays of ionized air up
like some column thaj was to hold the sirians from the
planet and they did

  but now again they began to slow down the planet-
not gently as they had had to before-but rapidly the
planet would have been pulled to pieces except that
the very attractor beams that were pulling on it tended
to relieve the stress but the cargo ships of venus
were pulling to keep the planet in motion it was a
strange thing to contemplate two mighty forces one
a fleet of two hundred million small ships the other a
force of as many thousand huge freight carriers having
a tug-o-war for a planet but the odds were too great
slowly the sirians won the planet was steadily
dropping toward the sun now it seemed no fleet could
come to aid them and the sirian fleet was being aug-
mented constantly by a steady stream of ships from
mars it was the sixth day after the announcement was

made that waterson had a fleet ready to attack the
sirians the venerians also had a fleet ready prepared
by the directions of watersons engineers sent by radio-
television and radiophone they were ready to attack
and the terrestrian fleet arrived at venus just six days
after the announcement of the new weapon

  the practical projector of this new ray had been
quite heavy and they had been mounted in groups of
twenty projectors on special hundred-man ships using
the same acceleration neutralizer used on the ten-man
ships they were arranged to throw a wide beam so
wide that the new ships with twenty could prevent any
action in a field of over two hundred miles depth and
in a cone with a base of six hundred miles diameter
the ships they had could approach within a hundred
miles of the sirian fleet without being seen for they
were painted black therefore and showed no lights in
the darkness of the void they were easily hidden

the entire expedition went as planned the radio
barrage had not been turned on and they were in
constant communication with the venerians the two
fleets were to attack simultaneously over different areas
so that between them they could wipe out so large a
number of the enemy ships that the fleet of two million
could easily handle the task

  hidden in the utter dark of the void they crept up on
the sirians they were in the sunlight but the black
coating kept them invisible while the sirian ships shone
brilliantly then at last the tip of the great cone forma-
tion was within asy striking distance of the fleet there
reached out the strange ray and here in space it was
utterly invisible but suddenly the ships within its range
began to waver to fall together under mutual gravita-
tion with one swoop they all shot toward the ships
in space that had paralyzed them for the attractor beams
had been turned on them as the great mass of ships
fell rapidly toward them long range dis rays reached
out and they melted into clouds of shimmering dust
great swaths were cut through their ranks a similar
scene was taking place far to the left of the terrestrian
fleet where the venerian fleet was working havoc among
the invaders now the last of the ships had been rayed
into nothingness and a great fleet of the sirians were
rushing forward to attack for the ships invisible on
account of their black line had been electrostatically lo-
cated now but as the sirians came within one hundred
miles of the other fleets the ships all ceased to accelerate
to change direction they just drifted straight into that
cone of dis rays all walls of the de-activating field
were lined with the ten-man ships their shorter range
dis rays prevented any sirians from escaping bright
lights shone out on the solarian fleet now-they wanted
the sirians to attack the original cone formation had
shifted rapidly now it was a double cone then it
changed to a quadruple cone there were six hundred
of the de-activator ships and these were arranged so
that they shot their rays off in four directions making
four cones of de-activated space with the fleet of de-
activator ships at the apex thus they were protected
on all sides and quickly as the sirian fleet spread out
more ships rose and there were six cones branching out
in the center rested the main mass of the fleet the long
range dis ships their attractors pointing out into the
cones to draw the disabled ships of the sirians into the
range of their dis rays emanating in thousands from the
the metal horde



ships lining the sides of the de-activated cones of space
the fleet was invulnerable and so sudden and complete
was the failure of their power in these de-activated
regions that they did not seem to have time to warn
their fellows many millions of the ships were lost
before the wild charge could be checked then the six-
cone formation entire began to move slowly around the
sirians waiting to see what was to happen were caught
before they were aware that they were in danger many
too were caught by the powerful attractor beams of
the heavy ships within-drawn in by the greater power
of the heavy ship till their power failed but at last
the sirians had learned the effective range of this new
power and tried hard to avoid it the six-cone forma-
tion was immediately broken up and the six hundred
de-activators went out individually each followed by a
swarm of the ten-man ships to disintegrate the ships
caught in the de-activating cones the terrestrian ships
were marked by a blazing blue light so that if they too
were caught in the de-activating field they were not dis-
integrated only those around them were and they were
then released as the ray did not seem to have any in-
jurious effects on man except to give him strange
dreams in some way the brain was stimulated by the
ray as long as the ray was used

  the de-activator ships were completely self-protecting
they could stop any number of attackers from any direc-
tion provided the paralyzed ships were disintegrated as
soon as caught for if too many were piled up the ten-
dency of the matter to disintegrate in the engines plus
the natural tendency of the space to resume the normal
curvature caused the ray to become ineffective as it
was overpowered and one ship was lost in this way
too many ships piled up and only part of them could
be rayed out by the ship itself and there were not a suf-
ficient number of helping ten-man ships but the mighty
fleet of the sirians was-already beaten they still out-
numbered us ten to one but they could not fight this
new force they began a running fight to mars and
now the solarians were united rapidly they wiped out
the edges of the fleet and gradually worked in toward
the center but the sirians could not fight back-they
could use only the explosive shells and few of them
reached their goal they were disintegrated or missed
not more than three thousand men were lost in that
entire engagement

  but now the solarians tried a plan to capture the
sphere a large number of the ten-man ships dropped
out of the main fleet but not enough to make it notice-
able to the hard-pressed sirians these were joined by
one hundred of the de-activator ships then these all
capable of higher speeds than the main fleet set out at
the highest speed that could safely be maintained and
darted toward mars undetected they rushed past the
sirian fleet and passed on toward mars they reached
the planet fully three hours ahead of the main fleet
by the time the main fleet had arrived it came unat-
tended for the last of the mighty fleet of two hundred
million torpedo-ships had been turned to impalpable
dust floating in space

  the advance guard arrived without warning and as
they had expected found the sphere resting on the
ground protected by a great fleet of the torpedo-ships
there were nearly a million ships there with the great
machines rapidly making more however all were
grouped in an area that could be covered by the cone of

the de-activating beam and out in space the ship com-
manders decided on a plan fifty of the de-activator
fleet took positions high above the sirians and the rest
went with the entire fleet of the ten-man ships these
were to approach the camp from the ground lying
close to the ground they would be hard to see in the
disappearing light at a fixed moment all the ships
above were to turn on their de-activator rays which
would be plainly visible in the martian atmosphere
while the ground fleet of fifty de-activators were to use
their rays from the side the ten-man ships were to
form a circle around the camp at a safe distance from
the de-activator rays for they would crash when their
power failed if they were caught by the de-activator
rays but they wanted to capture the sphere in good
condition so they arranged to have the space directly
above it unaffected by the de-activator field lest some
torpedo fall on it and destroy it this would leave an
exit for the torpedo ships except that at a point a mile
or so above the sphere a cross-ray made escape
impossible

  the rays were turned on instantly the fleet of nearly
a million torpedo-ships fell wildly out of control down
through the blue glowing air in which great streamers
of glowing red seemed to waver and twist just outside
the curtain of destruction waited the entire solarian
fleet slowly they closed in till their dis rays swept
all the ships within sixty miles of the edge out of exis-
tence then rapidly the de-activator beams were forced
ever sharper and sharper till at last only the sphere
and a few hundred of the torpedo-ships several hundred
of the torpedo-ship constructors and the corresponding
cargo ships and worker machines were left these had
been saved for investigation by the scientists for they
were helpless

  but the war was over now the sirians had been
destroyed or reduced to mere museum pieces now the
scientists came to investigate the sphere there was
much we wanted to learn from the creatures of the
sphere but it was a strange story that the sirian sphere
had to tell

aeons ago there lived on a great planet of sirius
a race of intelligent men shaped as we are but
smaller due to the greater gravity of their planet and
these men had developed a high civilization a civiliza-
tion different from ours in that they learned early about
mechanics but chemistry and physics merely developed
from the needs of the great mechanical engineers elec-
tricity was used as a powerful aid in their machines and
in their processes it was a by-product not an end

  gradually their machines eliminated more and more
of their work they became more and more complicated
but more and more trustworthy men began to experi-
ment with physics and found that their calculating ma-
chines needed development it was easy to add first
one step then the next more and more the machines
could do the mathematics became more and more com-
plicated and the machines developed the equations
found they could not handle them and passed them out
as unfinished results finally one man used the machines
to calculate the design of a machine that would be able
to do these new equations he built it but the calcula-
tions were wrong the machine had correctly solved his
problem but he had stated it wrong it resulted in a
machine that would solve only simple problems but it


amazing stories 

did something no other machine had ever done given
irrelevant data it would choose the correct facts and
solve the problem it was a step a short step toward
a machine that really thought

  progress thereafter was rapid the machines built
machines had been doing it for decades in fact but now
they did one thing more-they designed them now the
problem could describe the type of machine needed
and the worker machine would design it and turn out
the completed machine but these machines were rapidly
perfecting the beginning that man had made within a
decade after that first discovery of the principles of
mechanical thought the machine was made that could
not only solve problems but could also originate them
they had developed a brain it was a great machine
which occupied an entire building with its massive
framework bolted down to the ground

  man began a rapid decline for the machines did all
his work with the construction of a machine that could
originate a problem man made a mistake he had
created a machine that was more powerful than he
except that it was immobile and this machine originated
a new machine a machine that would release the energy
of matter it had developed this because it had been
able to see that such energy existed mans machines
could have solved it long ago but the problem had never
been stated now came a machine that could state its
own problems-and solve them

  and with this new energy it designed a new brain
machine a brain machine such as no mans brain could
conceive-a machine that could move for it was
powered by the energy of matter and could move as no
other machine had ever moved before-out into space

  still the machines worked for the sirian man and he
learned of the new discovery and began to design a
new brain machine

  some of the sirians realized the danger that was fac-
ing them and they had continued long researches on
mans brain and at last had discovered the secret of
giving a machine that emotion we call devotion loyalty
or gratitude and they built a great machine on that
principle and used material energy to power it it was
a success it could think original thoughts it pointed
out the danger of the existing machines - they were
stronger than man it was only mans mobility and
ability to control all mobile machines that had made him
superior for a brain without a tool or body is helpless
and now that was lost the existing brain-machines
should be destroyed and new ones built using the prin-
ciples that it was designed on

  but the mischief was done the new brain-machine
designed by a machine had done it a machine had been
built that was controlled by thoughts a machine that
could be controlled by the machines each of these ma-
chines was given a small brain equipped with televisor
sight and hearing and it was powered by material
energy jhey could run for years without outside care
for the thinking machinery they had was sufficient to
keep them oiled and to make them seek repairs when
they were damaged they were susceptible to thought
forces and did as the thought waves suggested and
reported to the control brain exactly what was going
on about it

  and now this new brain developed a space-flyer to
carry these machines and man could not help knowing
for its every thought was recorded for mans use then

one day this record was found destroyed the next day
the brain machine had left the planet and taken with
it the new space-flyer and the new telepathically con-
trolled machines

  to the outermost planet of the system of sirius the
great machine fled for years it remained there waiting
thinking then at last it called its worker machines into
action a new machine grew up from the stores of
metal that the space ship had brought with it at last the
metal was used up and the machine was not completed
so the space-flyer was sacrificed for the completion of
the machine the new machine was started from its
lip-like spout there poured a steady smooth stream of
molten metal and the rock on which it rested was eaten
away the first transmuting metal producer was made

  decades passed and only a small percentage of man
developed the rest sank deeper and deeper into a life
of ease the planets were all explored by the hardy ones
and no trace of the brain-machine was ever found for
it had discovered the dis fay and sunk deep into the
ground hollowing a great cave to live and work in

but back on that planet the scientists had developed
machines that surpassed it in power and finally
one of these picked up a thought message from that
distant machine that told its story it was a thought
that had not been consciously radiated only the mar-
velous sensitivity of this new machine could have de-
tected it but now the men knew it was too late to do
much to prevent it for they had no weapons but the
machine did it was preparing to drive man from the
planets to rule there in his stead with a population
of machines

  the scientists quickly built a great space-flyer a gigan-
tic machine of over ten miles diameter a huge sphere
and in that they established laboratories workshops
machines and living quarters they took with them the
finest men and women of their race and sailed out into
space taking an orbit about the sun of sirius they
were comfortable there in an equitable temperature
their ship lighted by the sun on one side and dark on the
other steadily revolving on its axis like a miniature
world the foods of the people were chemically pre-
pared for the brain - machines had taught them how
the air was repurified constantly by machines that regu-
lated the percentage of the gases to the thousandth of
one per cent but the entire ship was painted black
it could not be discovered floating there in space so
tiny in the vastness of a system

  it was two weeks after they sailed that the machine-
brain attacked it sailed out of its hiding place with
thousands of great ships armed with dis rays and with
explosives with heat rays and attractor beams the
population of those worlds was wiped out in a week
and the rule of the metal horde began

  the original brain built other brain machines to direct
its affairs on other planets and to do the work it did
not wish to do itself

  for nearly a century those men lived in space making
swift forays on a planet with a fleet of cargo ships that
revolved about the main ship like satellites when they
were not being used in these trips they would bring
back tons of rock and leave most of it stored in the
ships dumping them into the reservoir of the parent
ship when it was needed

  then a swift ship was developed a ship that could
the metal horde



start and stop more quickly than any made before-a
ship with acceleration neutralizers but the machine
brains of the metal horde never learned the secret
with a small fleet of these the men drove an attack at
the unprotected main brain machine there were no
men known to live in the system no other known
machine could move without the knowledge of that main
machine but these could they too had the dis ray now
and they destroyed the main brain machine they were
lost in the ensuing fight but that machine was destroyed

  all the remaining machines were equally powerful
any one of them could have built a brain machine that
could easily conquer the others-but it too would have
to bow to its creator they fought it out the men had
known this would be the result

  it was a war such as the system had never before seen
each force was equal and could not ally itself with any
other for the machines could not lie or state other than
their thoughts and each wanted supreme power they
developed new weapons weapons whose strength lay
in their number one by one the machine brains had
gone down to defeat the men of that ship helping to
disturb the balance of forces by ever so little yet always
enough to throw one side down to defeat yet always
remaining in hiding at last there remained but one
machine-brain and its weakened force necessitated its
return to the devastated planet with the destruction
of the other brain machines the remaining machines
that they had previously controlled automatically obeyed
the new master as perfectly as they did the old

  they returned to find a new fleet awaiting them but
it was not a vast fleet such as they had encountered be-
fore at once the torpedo-ship machines settled to the
ground and began turning out their weapons but it
was all over before they could enter as an important
factor these ships had a new weapon it was a ball of
glowing blue light that was driven along a beam of some
vibration and as it touched any ship the ship instantly
volatized so suddenly as to constitute an explosion the
balls of light lasted about a minute and a half each but
were replaced as quickly as they were used when they
were finally used they would die down to a dull red
glow then suddenly wink out they could be swept
from one ship to another taking toll of ten or twelve
ships each and the beam that guided them could drive
them with the speed of light and supply an infinite ac-
celeration they were glowing balls of concentrated
energy of some sort and as such could travel with the
speed of light

  but they were effective to the nth degree the entire
fleet of that one remaining brain machine would have
been lost but it retired into space racing away at top
speed out into space with the remaining remnant of its
great fleet

  and sixteen hundred years it had raced across space
to be destroyed at last by another race of men the
battle was over and the machine awaited its destruction

  we rayed it out of existence it was too great a
menace to keep

   some people still do not believe that those sirians
were truly machines they can not believe that a ma-
chine can have intelligence but certainly watersons cal-
culating machine has intelligence of a sort and they
ask what would a machine want to exist for  it would
have no aim nothing to perform why should it want
to live or exist

  we might ask what it is human beings want to live
for if there is an after-life it is certainly not that that
we live for i am sure no man wants to die yet what
aim have we what function must we perform why
should we wish to live our life is a constant struggle
the machines at least had eliminated that there seems
to me no reason why a machine should want to live but
certainly it has less reason to pass out of existence than
we have

  that war was destructive-terribly so but it has
brought its compensations more than fifteen million
human beings lost their lives in that great struggle either
in the battles in space or caught in the dis rays during
that battle on venus

   but those fifteen millions have died a painless death
and twenty billions live because of their sacrifice and
it was not a vain sacrifice we have learned much in
return no machines man ever made equaled the ma-
chines we captured there on mars and man will never
experiment  the lines of the machine-brain he has
been warned the brain-machine we captured was de-
stroyed without investigation the machines we use
the wonderful worker machines have been modified to
permit of radio control

   and stephen watersons discovery of the de-activat-
ing field not only helps in law enforcement but makes
war with material energy impossible no in all we have
lost little

   mars lost its cities its forests its ancient civilization
new cities are being built on the modern plan larger
finer more beautiful the forests are being replaced but
the records the relics of a civilization have been lost
forever in that we have lost much though all move-
able things were moved when the warning came there
was much that could not be moved the great palace
of horlak san was destroyed but it is being rebuilt in
the exact spot in exactly the same manner it is a
worth-while project but there is much which cannot be
restored

  it will be eleven more years before we will know
whether we can ever communicate with the sirian men
the speed of light is too low for rapid communication
and as the first signals were sent out in september 
and it is now september  the signals are not due
to reach sirius for two years more then it will be
 before we can hope to receive their reply i often
wonder if they will ever get those signals i can remem-
ber distinctly the recoil of the great projector as the
mighty surges of light flashed out across the universe
it seemed like some great gun-the back pressure of the
light was so great and what will those replies tell us
it is interesting to speculate on that subject

a massive steel
basket much re-
sembling a greatly
enlarged freight
container of a gon-
dola railway car pulled up be-
side the dock it halted di-
rectly before where my friend

mr kingston and i were
standing instinctively i looked
for a tow line supposing that
the load was carried by a
barge which on account of its
great burden was submerged

i could see no tow line and
no tug was in sight my com-
panion saw my bewilderment

  you will be interested in
our new method of transporta-
tion he said leading the way
to the edge of the wharf

  i peered over into the water

what was my surprise when
instead of a submerged barge
i saw a great blue whale

  is he real i asked with a gasp of astonishment

  real of course he is real said my friend with
a quiet laugh what is the good of knowing the great
secrets of nature if we cant make use of them

  these whales and the sharks he went on are carry-
ing the better part of our heavy stuff the cement and the
building stone for instance without them we would
be in a frightful mess of congestion we should have
the whole channel full of freight boats tugs and barges
there wouldnt be room for the craft to get around
these servants of ours need only room enough to slide
through they handle more material in one day than a
whole harbor full of boats could handle in a week be-
sides it costs money to buy or build boats and barges
and this old sulphur-bottom is nearly ninety feet long
and we have sharks that are about fifty feet

  the unloaders are coming now i shall have the
pleasure of showing you some real efficiency

  at that moment there issued from one of the avenues
between the great piles of materials the most motley gang
of dock wallopers that it had ever been my privilege to
see

  first came some half dozen lively little apes closely
followed by as many huge and fearsome visaged afri-
can gorillas these gorillas were flanked by two pow-

 rjyhe empire of the ants is gen-
 erally and universally conceded
 to be the most perfect functioning
 organization known what makes
 it possible for them to carry on their
 work without any apparent leader-
 ship or supervision mr kateley
 develops an original idea in a very
 ingenious manner-namely the con-
 trol of intellects of animals and in-
 sects from a center of dissemination
 basing our assumptions on present-
 day findings we can hardly say that
 the conception of remote control
 is impossible we recommend this
 as an exceedingly interesting story
 well worth your careful reading

erful lumbering elephants

  without a moments hesi-
tation the monkeys swarmed
agilely over the newly arrived
cargo and with movements of
incredible swiftness untied and
rolled up the tarpaulins that
covered the freight it proved
to ie a cargo of sacks of ce-
ment

  by now the more powerful
but less agile gorillas were on
the load they picked up the
huge bundles of tarred canvas
and tossed them easily to the
dock then they laid down
net slings and began filling
them with bags of cement
picking up and tossing the hun-
dred pound sacks as easily as
a man would so many bricks

  one of them is as strong as
ten or a dozen men remarked
kingston as the first sling was
filled now watch the big
boys do their stuff give them your careful attention
the two elephants stepped to the edge of the dock
and extending their trunks passed them through the
loops at the ends of the slings which were held in readi-
ness by a couple of the little monkeys

  they swung it aloft dumped the sacks on the plat-
form with a heavy thud and returned the empty sling
with a swiftness and precision that was astonishing
almost before i had time to realize what was going on
the first load of perhaps a hundred tons was unloaded
and another load was pulled in the great whale sliding
swiftly away and giving place to another nearly as large

  i stood looking at the whole performance overcome
with amazement

  i cant believe it i said at length there just
aint no such thing

  go to the ant thou sluggard consider his ways and
be wise quoted kingston

  at that moment something under water a little way out
from the docks caught my eye soon i was able to make
out a long procession of whales and giant sharks al-
though they were quite submerged i was able to see that
each was carrying a large container on his back loaded
with stone some had but a single block while other
loads were made up of smaller pieces


undoubtedly
that is the brain
and nerve center of
the whole colonyde-
clared kingston

  we are using these rocks for masonry coffer dams
said kingston you see we are sinking several shafts
in order to build the tunnel in sections in this way we are
able to employ more of the large excavating machines
and it is much easier to dispose of the debris out in the
channel than it would be if it were all brought up at the
two coastlines

  you see we are very fortunately located here for the
securing of building materials the cornish coast just
up the channel affords an inexhaustible supply of the
best granite rock and the cement works just over yonder
at portland furnish the best grade of cement right at
tidewater the stone can be transported under water
with a minimum of effort for its weight when sub-
merged is considerably reduced

  then again these carriers can place a rock in a sub-
merged position exactly where it is wanted without the
work of an additional handling the method is proving
both swift and economical

had thought that i knew kingston and his work
but all this had me floundering beyond my depth
midway between incredulity and amazed curiosity i
managed to ask

  but-but where are the bosses for the monkeys and
the supervisors for the whales 

  oh we have established offices in london he ex-
plained this is all carried on through a system of
television and of remote control

  you see there were no buildings in dover or any-
where along the english channel large enough to house
our office force and necessary equipment

  you must know that this england-to-france tube is
by far the largest engineering feat ever undertaken it
requires very many clerical and other workers

  the only people we have here are the material
checkers they take care of receiving and reshippin
such stuff as you see here on the wharf come i wifi
show you one of their booths

 


amazing stories

  so saying he led me to a little glassed-in office here
we found two men seated at desks but apparently idle
but in reality their attention was fixed on a number of
typing and computating machines on the opposite side
of the room

  the machines were being operated at lightning speed
not by lady typists as one might expect but by bushy-
tailed gray squirrels

  did you ever see a squirrel operating a revolving
wheel in a cage  asked kingston well thats where
i got my idea that they would make good stenographers
i believe they can move at least twenty times more quickly
than a human being

  i could readily believe that such was the case for one
of the little creatures was mounted on the keyboard of
a comptometer operating the keys with all four feet
he was working with a frenzy of almost imperceptibly
quick movements so that one could scarcely believe there
was any intelligent system to his performance

  another was operating a quivering typewriter with
equal swiftness

  do you mean to tell me that these squirrels know
what keys they are stepping on  i asked

  well no they dont exactly know what they are
doing any more than your hands know what they are
doing when they comb your hair their little minds-
such as they are-are crowded aside by the will of the
director

  this state of efficiency however is arrived at only
after a great deal of practice the director must educate
the muscles of his squirrel just as a human operator must
educate the muscles of his hands

  i dont suppose they will ever know that they are
doing their part in building a thousand-foot tunnel
nearly twenty miles long and they may see you but
they will probably never know that you are the discoverer
of the great principle that has rendered all this possible
and he slapped me affectionately on the back

  what i have done is nothing compared with what
you are accomplishing i replied

  and even that little was only an accident i con-
tinued reminiscently

  and indeed such was the case

  what he had in mind had all happened some four
years before

  i had been employed for a number of years-in fact i
still am-in the patent office in washington

  i had known kingston more or less intimately for
some time in fact i had accompanied him only the year
before on a most extraordinary expedition-an expedi-
tion that had led to some extremely interesting and im-
portant discoveries

  at that time he was an amateur scientist employed as
a designer of excavating machinery in a large manu-
facturing plant to say he was an amateur in science is
probably doing him something of an injustice for i
fully believe that even then he had a deeper insight into
the physical properties of all matter than any other man
i have ever been privileged to meet

  he had already perfected some experiments pertaining
to atomic densities that were destined to have almost
revolutionary effects in the realm of physics

  his was a personality such as made one instinctively
feel that he was in the presence of a great mind and in
addition i had found him to be a most companionable and
genial spirit

i have long been something of an amateur scientist
myself not that i have any great store of scientific
knowledge or have ever accomplished much of a scien-
tific nature but i have always been keenly interested in
the unseen forces that rule the everyday world in fact
my interest in scientific matters has always far outrun
my ability to investigate

  i have a months vacation every year and i usually
spend the major portion of it rusticating on the old farm
in minnesota where i was born here i have quiet
and leisure for studying any phenomenon of nature that
for the moment has enlisted my attention for a few
weeks i am a geologist a zoologist or perhaps an ento-
mologist browsing among the secrets of nature

  the old homestead has a small creek with a good fish
pond the pond and the riffles are teeming in summer
with all manner of interesting aquatic life here too is
a large gravel pit replete with fossilized remains of pre-
historic formations and the old grove and fields abound
with a wealth of insect life

  so with my hooks of reference my microscope and a
few other pieces of paraphernalia i usually put in my
time enjoyably and not altogether unprofitably

  at the time of which i write i was especially inter-
ested in ants their anatomy building habits social
customs and what not i had even gone so far as to
establish a colony of the little creatures in a glassed-in
formicary in the library-living room of my town lodgings
where i could have them under daily observation this
year i was looking forward to my month at the old
homestead with pleasant anticipation for i felt sure op-
portunities for ant study would be abundant

   shortly before vacation time however i received a let-
ter from kingston saying among other things that he was
going to have a long vacation while his company were
remodelling and installing new machinery in some of the
buildings of the plant i lost no time in inviting him to
join me at the old farm where we could fish and rest or
together chase our favorite phantoms and i mentioned
in my letter that i intended to give considerable time to
the ants

  he replied promptly saying he would take great
pleasure in helping me catch my favorite ant and asking
permission to bring with him a few articles of laboratory
equipment in order to carry out some experiments which
he had in mind

  a fortnight later we were sitting on the bank of the
old fish pond in the bend of the creek fishing for young
pickerel and scanning the water with a pair of short
range binoculars in quest of strange forms of aquatic
life behind us was the old gravel pit where we had
spent a part of the morning examining some ancient sea
shells that evidently had been preserved in the sand since
pre-glacial times when this particular area must have
been submerged beneath salt water

  how about your ants asked kingston i hope you
are not forgetting them in your zeal to entertain me

   oh no i replied i shall not forget them in fact i
brought these glasses all the way from washington for
the express purpose of studying the creatures

  i plan to go up on the hill back of the sand pit to
look for a formicary this afternoon there used to be
several of them there in the edge of the little grove you
know they like to build on high sandy soil i plan to arm
my forces with a spade the high-power microscope and
these binocularspand march upon the formicidfe
remote control



   yes rejoined my friend very gravely caisar said
 that conquests were more often won by the spade than by
 the sword

   but to me the matter of impedimenta seems of equal
 importance you know napoleon said an army travels
 on its belly or was it stomach well anyway i be-
 lieve leading strategists are agreed that no one ought to
 risk an engagement with any of the tribes of hymenop-
 tera without a copious supply of lacteal fluid rich in
 casein and lactic acid

   so saying he took the thermos bottle from the basket
 and drank generously he was a great buttermilk hound
 and now while he was on the farm where all dairy pro-
 ducts were plentiful he was making the most of his op-
 portunities

   a valuable suggestion i agreed no doubt the
 boys will be back from the creamery when we go down to
 the house for lunch and we will load the old demijohn
 with a fresh cool supply

   and so that afternoon we took our basket loaded
jl with the glasses a few smaller instruments a bottle
of cedar oil for the oil-immersion lens together with
kingstons beloved buttermilk bottle and hopefully
climbed the little hill that flanked the gravel-pit here as
i had expected we found a couple of very populous
formicaries and chose one close to the shade of a small
maple tree for our investigations this nest seemed to be
very nearly if not quite on the spot where i had known
one to be fully twenty years before when i was a small
boy

   i am inclined to believe that the colony had occupied
 the same quarters for at least two decades and possibly
 much longer the mound was about two feet in diam-
 eter and perhaps ten or twelve inches high it was made
 up largely of small twigs and straws pebbles etc the
 ants were quite large with red thorax and dark almost
 black abdomen the female or working ants varied
 quite extensively as to size and strength of mandibles

   we identified the tenants of this domain as belonging
 to the group lasiiis niger variety americanus

   upon examination we found the workers busy at their
 multifarious occupations they were carrying in frag-
 ments of insects and other articles of food bringing out
 rubbish and carrying their little aphids-ants cows-to
 and from the pasture grounds the nurse ants were
 bringing their charges the grubs and iarvse out for an
 afternoon airing

   in fact all was orderly commotion

   while we watched a group of workers appeared at the
 edge of the mound bringing in a twig several inches
 long there were more than a dozen of them at this job
 and their performance revealed perfect teamwork

   we were anxious to see something of the substructure
 of the formicary so we decided to start an excavation
 by digging a hole some five feet deep at a distance of
 several feet from the mound

   this we lengthened in the direction of the ants habi-
 tation in order to reveal a vertical section of the works
 without too greatly disturbing the inhabitants or injuring
 their home as we approached the vicinity of the sub-
 structure carefully shaving the soil away in vertical
 slices we came upon the quarters of a colony of minute
 red ants whom we at once recognized as robbers the
 little creatures were no doubt preying on their much
 larger neighbors and living largely off stolen food

   we soon found that the rooms and galleries of the red
 ants were connected by tiny tunnels with those of the
 larger formicary and that these tunnels were too small
 for the larger ants to enter through such an arrange-
 ment rendered it possible for the little marauders to slip
 into their victims quarters and snatch anything small
 enough to carry away and duck back to safety with it

   at length we came upon the rooms and galleries of the
 large ants and found them busy with their household
 duties

   some were taking care of the eggs and young many
 were engaged in carefully cleaning themselves and one
 another busily brushing and licking every part of their
 bodies some were at work excavating new chambers
 and galleries while others carried the loose soil away
 here again we witnessed perfect teamwork and co-
 operation

   we found that their workings extended even below the
 bottom of our five-foot excavation owing to the fact
 that it was a very warm afternoon we soon lost en-
 thusiasm for digging any deeper and lay down in the
 shade to discuss what we had seen

   they are very clever little creatures arent they
 remarked my companion

 - i hardly know whether they have intelligence or not

 i replied

   some naturalists claim that all that they do is ac-
 complished by instinct alone that every movement is a
 reaction to some sensory stimulus and that their be-
 havior is controlled by something more deeply seated than
 intelligence this something is inseparable from the
 fundamental life processes

   i took out the field book of insects by my favorite
 authority frank e lutze phd and read as follows
 from his discussion of the anatomy of insects

     the central nervous system is a double longi-
   tudinal series connected one with another by cords
   there is no brain strictly speaking for the ganglia
   in the thorax seem to be about as important as those
   in the head nerves run from each ganglion to
   near by parts of the body

   now if there is no brain i argued how could there
 be any intelligence

   i cant say anything about the brain part kingston
 countered but you must admit there are evidences of in-
 telligence you saw how they all lifted at the same time
 on that long twig you see how workmanlike they are
 in their excavating-each doing his part and doing it
 correctly we know that their arrangements of passages
 and galleries are not haphazard for each variety has its
 own characteristic plan of home architecture the dif-
 ferent groups are as easily identified by their building
 methods as by their physical characteristics

   it certainly requires intelligence to build such a
 complicated system of compartments and tunnels all
 according to a preconceived plan especially since they
 have no blueprints to go by

   on the contrary i persisted the fact that they al-
 ways follow a general plan and that each seems to take
 little or no notice of what his fellows are doing only goes
 to convince me that they are not intelligent

 tn the first place the worker ant only lives a few
 i- months passing all her life in a single formicary
 we have no reason to believe that she ever studies the
 inside of any other establishment then how could she


amazing stories

 no matter how intelligent learn the plan and details of
 a home  she is able to do her part in building as soon
 as she is fully developed

   then again in all the public works in all the engineer-
ing projects carried on no one has ever been able to dis-
cover anything remotely resembling supervision there
is no master builder planning and coordinating the work
now suppose a group of men were about to erect a
building would it be possible for each one to do as he
individually saw fit without regard to orders from any-
body there would naturally be too many doing one
thing and nobody doing another there would be too
much studding and not enough rafters or vice versa
no one would think of determining where the doors and
windows should be and in fact with no one to direct and
coordinate the work it is obvious that however intelligent
the individual workmen might be no appreciable pro-
gress could be made all would be confusion as it was
at the tower of babel

   yet among the ants all is orderly and efficient

   surely you would not say that ants have intelligence
superior to that of human beings or that individual hu-
mans could not exercise as much judgment as individual
ants could i countered

   well said kingston if they have no leader how
do they know who is to go for food who is to make tun-
nels and who is to care for the young or the hundred and
one other things that ants do you say there are no
foremen and no directors but how do you know that 

   now look at these workers bringing this twig here
is a large one struggling along on this side near the front
let us suppose that she may be the forelady we might
easily imagine her giving directions as she works

    gladys you are a little too far back come for-
ward a couple of paces and catch hold just behind mary
jane now lift the front end over that stone right up
high with it

    and you on the back let your end down so it will
slide along on the top of the stone

    now sarah and elizabeth come here and give me a
lift remember when we come to that weed stalk you
girls up there in front want to go to the right side of it
not to the left

    now we will let it rest a moment until evelyns
gang get out of the way with that old log that gang
makes me sick they dodge around that timber like a
bunch of old maid grasshoppers and then when they do
get home with one piece it usually takes them all the rest
of the afternoon to manicure their antennce

   highly amusing i laughed but hardly scientific

   of course you know he went on we cant hope to
hear all this for our great flapping ears are not attuned
to the wave lengths that serve to carry their little voices
but i strongly suspect that if we had sufficiently strong
magnifiers we could hear their communications although
of course we would not be able to understand their lan-
guage

   he lit his pipe and went on hearing and sight are
very peculiar things things that as yet we know little
about

  we have made some progress in these matters in
recent years progress in the way of x-rays telescopes
microscopes and radio in fact we have gone just far
enough to reveal how great is the field and how little of
it we know i suspect that we are merely on the border-
land of the possibilities still beyond and then it is just

possible that ants and other insects have an additional
sense apart from the five that we possess it might be
somewhat akin to hearing to sight or to the sense of
touch but since we do not have it we cannot name it
neither can we have any conception of its nature

   if all people were blind and had always been blind
no one could possibly know anything about sight there
would be no name for such an experience and no one
would be able to discover it in the animals

   sight is such a marvelous such a complicated thing
that no stretch of the imagination could have conjured
up such a faculty had it not been known in human ex-
perience

   it may be that throughout their entire bodies insects
are sensitive to certain vibrations vibrations associated
with wave lengths we know nothing of

  we know that light sound heat and other natural
phenomena have characteristic wave lengths we know
that some of these waves are very long some very short
and some are of intermediate length we have been
able to segregate a little group of them here and there
for purposes of identification and some of them we can
measure very accurately we know the length of those
we sense as color and those which we utilize in radio
etc but there are wide gaps between the known groups
presumably filled with waves the uses of which we have
yet to discover

   i might illustrate the thought in this way suppose
we draw a line through san francisco chicago cleve-
land and new york it so happens that they are exactly
in a straight line and suppose that only those parts of
the line within the narrow limits of the four cities was
known and the long stretches between were unex-
plored wilderness this would be a fair representation
of our knowledge of vibrations and wave lengths

   in all probability there are many longer waves-far
longer than the longest we know perhaps hundreds or
thousands of times as long in fact their limits may be
circumscribed only by the inconceivable reaches of space
itself and at the end of the scale beyond the short
wave lengths there may be countless gradations of shorter
and shorter lengths

   there is of course a limit to the shortness of a
space that the human mind can conceive of but there is
perhaps no limit to the shortness of a space that nature
can divide and the possibilities of different forces at
work employing different wave lengths are absolutely
boundless

   so i say it is quite conceivable that an insect might
have a hundred distinct senses instead of only two or
three or five as we have and i believe i am justified in
thinking that the mere fact that we cannot see an ant
acting as foreman and directing the work is no sign that
such directing is not being done

   yes i admitted that is a possible explanation but
i have a somewhat different theory although as yet it is
only a theory my conception is that a single ant is not
an entire individual in other words these units that we
see are not the entire entity but only parts of a larger
animal other parts of which escape our notice

perhaps i can explain by using the following il-

    lustration suppose in the case of a hundred-legged
worm the common centipede that we were able to see
only the legs and the feet and the body were completely
invisible we would then have two rows of feet and legs
remote control



going along all nearly alike and all keeping in line all
inarching at the same speed and at uniform distances
apart if one line should turn the other would turn
also there would appear to be perfect cooperation and
teamwork

  because we could see no connection between them
we might suppose that each was a complete animal and
that each was intelligent and highly efficient as a marcher
and we would naturally wonder how the general move-
ments of the whole group were directed or to put it in
another light suppose there were a race of beings so
constituted that they could not see our bodies but only
our hands

   they would be interested in watching our hands do-
ing all manner of things writing using tools operating
machines and so on they would naturally suppose that
our hands were possessed of intelligence yet upon ex-
amination no brain could be found then suppose we
had a dozen hands a hundred or even as many as an ant
hill has ants all these hands might be at work with
seeming intelligence and no particular hand would ap-
pear to be directing the others as to what to do or how
to do it

   of course i know you might find objections to this
analogy as applied to the ants you may say that each
ant has its own organs such as digestive apparatus sight
and smell and i might answer so does every part of
an amaba have its own organs or rather the functions
of organs each part digests the food with which it
comes in contact the parts move and react to stimuli
although there is no brain and no nerves or sense organs
as we know them

  then again our own hands have certain sense or-
gans such as the sense of touch sensitiveness to heat
and cold etc i see no reason therefore why nature
could not add other senses such as sight and taste in
fact all the senses we know and others that we know not
so perhaps these ants that we see are only a great many
operating parts of one animal as we have hands fish
have fins an octopus has tentacles and so this thing has
ants

  yes yes go on said kingston whimsically you
are making my world larger every moment let me see
the rest of your strange beastie

   well i hardly know if i can do that i admitted
you know vision has its limitations there may be
nerves or substitutes for nerves right before your eyes
passing from each ant to some central location but you
cannot see them let us consider a nerve it is a little
string of white fatty substance extending from the
brain as a ganglion to some portion of the body when
a message passes along this substance we do not know
what is really happening apparently there is no move-
ment of the nerve substance and no change in its compo-
sition so we are led to believe that the nerve itself has
no intelligence nor mechanical energy and that it only
acts as a passive medium on which the message travels

we do not know what a nerve message really is
to our senses it has no tangible form or sub-
stance but our reason dictates that it is a movement of
some kind of energy perhaps a series of vibrations of
some sort possibly akin to light heat or electricity and
the human brain knowing far more than we know is
able to interpret these vibrations in terms of sight smell
touch etc or if the vibrations originate in the brain

some organs in the muscles-organs which we have yet to
discover-have power to translate them in terms of
motion i think that so far my hypothesis is altogether
reasonable is it not  i asked

  yes i can agree to all that my friend rejoined
go on

  well i continued sometimes we send messages-
such as telephone messages-on a wire and sometimes
we dispense with the wire we just give the words a
little impulse by the help of some electrical apparatus
and let them find their own conductor and they go all
right we cannot see them as they travel on but when
they arrive at their destination perhaps thousands of
miles away they reveal themselves to human conscious-
ness fully as well as when sent by wire

  in fact we are already commencing to think of writing
as a somewhat superannuated and archaic method of
communication

  it is within the province of reason to suppose that
while nature can and does send messages over nerves
as we send them over wire she can also dispense with
that little line of fatty matter as readily as we can dispense
with the copper wire and send messages as we send them
over or through or by some medium that is imperceptible
to human senses

  we often hear of some instance that would tend to
justify this belief

  i remember when i was a small boy i heard my uncle
tell how he met with an accident while operating a well-
drilling machine something sharp struck his right
hand with such force that it passed through his leather
glove and completely severed his little finger at the
second joint

  realizing that his hand was badly injured he im-
mediately started for the doctors house it so hap-
pened that the doctor lived close by

  he removed the remains of his tattered glove as he
went and in so doing let the severed portion of his
finger fall to the ground paying no attention to this
incident he hurried on to the doctor who dressed the
wound

  this happened in the winter and soon my uncle
commenced to experience the feeling that the missing
finger was cold but since there was really no finger
there to get cold he tried to ignore the feeling

  presently the weather became more severe and the
pain increased at length he decided to find the severed
member and put it in a warm place this he was able
to do after a somewhat prolonged search and promptly
the distress was relieved

  i might relate a number of similar instances and
maybe you know of some yourself

  but the point is that our nervous system may not
have to use a continuous tangible nerve to register
feeling

  lets take a drink said kingston he turned to the
basket for his bottle

  what happened here he exclaimed the cork is
out of the thermos and the little oil bottle is broken
everything is in a mess

  i hope your buttermilk isnt all wasted i said i
suppose i must have hit the basket with the spade when
i was digging

  oh i guess there is not much gone he replied ex-
amining the bottle and taking a drink


amazing stories

i hastened to take the microscope and binocu-
lars out of the mixture of cedar oil and buttermilk in
the bottom of the basket

   i laid the glasses aside meaning to wipe them dry
after attending to the basket but we fell into further
discussion and i forgot them

   half an hour later perhaps i had occasion to use the
binoculars to examine some detail of the formicary as
the lenses came into proper focus i noticed a small
blotch of slight cloudiness on one of the glasses i at
once thought of the spilt oil and buttermilk and was on
the point of interrupting my observations to wipe the in-
strument when something quite unusual caught my eye

   it was a tiny gleam of brilliant color which lay just
beside a medium-sized worker ant as the ant moved
along the particles of color moved with it

   my first thought was that she was carrying something
that reflected the sunlight yet this seemed impossible
for the bright spot appeared to be about midway along
the thorax as the worker mounted a little rise the area
lengthened and became a thin thread of silvery shimmer-
ing blue then this thread lengthened and shortened as
she moved on another ant moved into the clouded area
and immediately i discovered that she also was ac-
companied by a similar fragment of color

   by this time my curiosity was thoroughly aroused i
focused on other ants and found them all accompanied
by the same phenomenon and to my ever-increasing
surprise i found that in some cases this line of brilliance
was very long in one instance where a small worker
was mounted on a twig the strange glimmer was fully
two inches long it was like a ray of some peculiar kind
of light

   i now noted that from all the workers within my ob-
servation the color line extended in approximately the
same direction that is toward the center of the formi-
cary regardless of which way the ant was facing

   as i was puzzling over this kingstons voice broke in
on my consciousness he had noticed how intent i was
on the spectacle and had no doubt detected a look of
astonishment on my face

   what is it he said are you seeing a ghost

   i hardly know what it is i replied in my bewilder-
ment

   i handed him the glasses look at the ants through
the clouded spot in the right lens i directed

   he held the glasses to his eyes i watched him with

interest	

   for a moment the binoculars were stationary then
i saw that he was moving his line of vision from place
to place evidently he was transferring his attention
from ant to ant just as i had done

   what do you make of it watson i asked

   he did not answer very soon he focused the glasses
on the opposite side of the ant-hill for a few moments
then he picked up a twig from the top of the mound and
held it before him he noted that several of the inhabi-
tants clung to the twig at length he lowered the glasses

and turned on me

   what can it be i said hoping that he might have

some explanation

   he stared at me as if unable to comprehend my ques-

tion	 

   why my god man what do you suppose it is he
asked as if entirely out of patience with my density
what were you just talking about

  and then with an abrupt change of manner he ex-
 tended his hand

  my dear fellow he said i want to congratulate
 you on having made the greatest discovery in zoology of
 the twentieth century it is beyond question the nerve
 system of the ant colony

  but why i said incredulously has no one ever
 seen it before

  my companion was examining the spot on the lens

   i suppose he replied that no naturalist has ever
 before had the good fortune to spill just the exactly cor-
 rect mixture of cedar oil and buttermilk on his lens
 we must preserve this dried film with the utmost care

again we took up the examination we found a
worker several feet from the mound and had no
trouble in discovering the bright line and tracing it from
her all the way to the side of the ant hill

   then we thrust the point of the spade into the formi-
 cary and took up a mass of the building material covered
 and filled with ants

  holding this above the mound and focusing the
glasses on a point below it we beheld innumerable lines
of brilliance extending to the formicary

   it resembled a wonderfully illuminated waterfall

   i have no doubt that the queen ant is the center of
 this marvelous system i announced we ought to
 continue our excavations until we find her

   it might be quite a long job said my friend the
 sun is getting low and that bank of clouds will soon ob-
 scure it so maybe we had better wait until morning

   i am afraid to put it off i replied with some im-
 patience because it may be that when this film on the
 glasses dries a little more it will lose this marvelous
 quality and then we might never know the origin of
 the lines we might never be able to hit upon just the
 right combination

 yes you may be right about that he admitted and
 in that case we had better go on as far as we can tonight
 so i hastily started digging again shaving the vertical
 layers of the formicary stopping every now and then
 while kingston examined the direction of the lines

   but very soon the suns rays commenced to lose their
 brilliance the lines became increasingly hard to detect
 and follow

  so we decided to call it a day and go home that
 evening we determined to treat some panes of glass with
 cedar oil and buttermilk to see if by any chance they
 would give the same effect as the lens we cleaned a
 dozen or more photographic dry-plates and covered them
 with a thin film of cedar oil and buttermilk mixed in
 varying proportions

   these we set aside to dry then we treated the other
 lens of the binoculars with a mixture that we hoped
 would be effective

   the next day proved to be rainy but during the day
 there occurred several short periods of sunshine between
 showers we took advantage of these short periods to
 test our treated glasses

  we soon found that none of the plates gave any re-
 sults neither did the newly covered lens but we were
 gratified to find that the original clouded one still re-
 tained its magic quality it was evident that we had not
 hit upon the proper proportion of oil and buttermilk
 the lens seemed to be too opaque this was presumably
 due to too great a proportion of buttermilk
remote control



  we hastily prepared a more attenuated mixture and
replaced the old coating during a later period of sun-
shine we found that this new film gave perceptible re-
sults but was far from satisfactory

  after several trials with varying proportions we
finally arrived at one containing only a trace of butter-
milk

  by this time the sun was so low that we had no
further opportunity to test our work and so were
obliged to postpone further experiment until the follow-
ing day

  fortunately the morning was clear and light we
were at the formicary bright and early to our great
delight we found that our newly treated lens was a suc-
cess in fact it was quite as clear as the old one and of
course afforded a much larger field of vision so that now
we were able to observe a large group of ants at one
time when a large number were lifted from the formi-
cary en masse it gave a very beautiful effect the bril-
liant lines were so close together that in some cases the
eye could not separate them but they never seemed to
cross

  by manipulating several groups in the air at one time
we provided some very striking effects we were so
entranced with the brilliance and beauty of the spectacle
that it was only with the greatest reluctance that we at
length forced ourselves to go to work

  we now continued our excavation one watching the
direction of the lines from near by ants while the other
removed the soil and deposits of the formicary

  upon arriving at a point near the center of the mound
and two or three inches above the surrounding surface
soil we came upon a locality where all lines seemed to
converge but to our surprise there was no queen ant
present in fact there seemed to be only a deposit of ant
eggs in an exceptionally large cell using the low power
lens of the microscope we discovered that there was in-
deed a very minute basket-like arrangement apparently
composed of silken fibre such as that from which the ant
grubs spin their cocoons

  switching to the  lens we were able to make out
that the little container was filled with an almost trans-
parent liquid

although we investigated carefully we could see
nothing further and upon segregating the tiny
basket-like object and moving it about we discovered that
the convergence of the bright lines moved with it follow-
ing it from place to place

  apparently there was nothing to do but try the oil im-
mersion lens yet we hesitated because we feared that
the oil to be used might prove fatal to the animal matter
in case there really was a living creature present

  after some discussion we decided to carry on i
brought a large flat stone on which we carefully mounted
our microscope and an auxiliary light condenser then
with the tiny basket mounted on a crystal slide we com-
menced our examination i knew that kingston was a
very accomplished microscopist and i permitted him to
take charge of the work

  for some time his efforts were unsuccessful but at
length he announced i believe i have it

  a moment later he affirmed emphatically yes here
it is sure enough and its alive he added presently
needless to say i was all agog and impatient to have a
look and my companion soon gave his place to me

  immediately there appeared before my vision a very
minute but quite distinct object it resembled an im-
perfectly formed brain it was palpitating slightly and
as i gazed spellbound it moved perceptibly with an
amoeba-like motion

  apparently it was suspended somewhat below the sur-
face of the crystal-clear liquid in which it was immersed

  undoubtedly that is the brain and nerve center of the
whole colony declared kingston i have no doubt that
it is hatched from a special kind of egg and that it
draws its nourishment from this bath in which it is
immersed after the manner of an amoeba

  probably the ants deposit predigested food substances
in the bath there regurgitated foods may be prepared
and concentrated in the digestive tracts of especially
adapted workers or it may be that the queen herself
performs this as a royal duty

  i doubt very much if it comes from an egg went on
kingston i think it is more likely in the nature of an
amoeba that is to say its method of reproduction is by
division and like an amoeba its life is eternal except in
case of destruction from outward sources perhaps after
a subdivision of the organism the superfluous brain is
carried away by a young queen about to institute another
colony in the same manner as a young queen often flies
away with a number of small wingless workers or a
fragment of fungus culture with which to start a new
establishment

  be that as it may i replied i think we can safely
say that this is the animal itself possessed of brain
power and intelligence and that what we call ants are
only its multitudinous appendages the queen being in
reality only its reproductive organ

  the various parts of its anatomy are not connected
one with another by organic tissues but they arc con-
nected and coordinated into one complete entity by this
marvelous and beautiful system of nerves this network
of lines of force

  this is indeed a great discovery said kingston im-
pressively and i foresee that it is sure to have far-
reaching results

  after a moment he went on if we could only
discover what this nerve energy is and determine the
wave length of its vibrations we could apply the force to
all animals we could revolutionize all industry

   i will not dwell on the account of our further investiga-
tions suffice it to say that we returned to our respective
employments after vacation and i spent my spare time in
preparing a report to submit to the entomological society
i prepared it with much care and elaboration for i was
convinced that it would create a furor when it came to
the notice of the scientific world

meanwhile as his letters revealed my colleague
was busy in his little home laboratory trying to
analyze this peculiar nerve force that could travel through
space

   one day i received a letter full of jubilation

  i find he wrote that it is not far different from
light its wave length is not a great deal shorter than
those at the violet end of the spectrum

  he went on to say that he was trying to produce an
apparatus that would generate this force he also sug-
gested that we give a name to this new found entity in
order to distinguish it from light electricity etc and
aptly suggested the name formicidary rays


amazing stories

  a still later letter adyised me that he had succeeded in
producing a generator that was something like a cross
between a dry battery and an x-ray machine and that he
was now able to produce visible lines of formicidary rays
at will

  i asked for a few days leave of absence and took a
hurried trip to his home where i found him hard at work
in his laboratory

  i have asked the company for three months off he
explained and they have retaliated by electing me to the
position of third vice-president as yet the third vice-
president has no duties prescribed so i am at leisure and
entirely at your service

  he showed me his new apparatus and proceeded to
demonstrate it

  for this work i have been able to expose one of my
nerves he explained as he unwrapped a finger that i had
noticed was bandaged he displayed an incision in the
flesh that revealed a small silvery white line easily dis-
cernible with the pocket lens

  he immersed his finger in a transparent bath contained
in his apparatus

  i know this is a very crude method of connecting
up he observed but i have no doubt i shall be able to
get away from it when i have had time to perfect the
details

  here you see is my subject whereupon he picked
up a small glass box containing an ant at the same time
he operated a number of controls of his mechanism

  now take the glass and watch for the nerve line he
directed

  i did so and immediately saw that the line was estab-
lished extending from the ant toward the operator

  you see i am using my own brain for sending he
explained you will perceive that my subject is eating
a bit of honey such reflex actions can be carried on
without intelligent direction but now watch what she
does i am going to direct her to go and get that
straw

  a small fragment of straw was lying some distance be-
hind the ant at once the ant ceased eating and ab-
ruptly turning round picked up the straw and made off
with it

  that will do sarah said kingston with a chuckle

  the ant dropped the straw and went back to the honey

  what do you think of that asked my host

  i think you are a wizard i replied hastily

  no i am not he said i am only an amateur scient-
ist next time you come i will have a guinea pig perform
for you

  im willing to believe anything now i said i am
fully prepared to see anything happen but tell me why
do you think you can apply this to animals also 

  i have reason to believe he answered that a like
force actuates the nervous system of all animals the
only difference between the ants and the others is that
the ants have a specialized sending apparatus-broadcast-
ing mechanism if you will-that causes the message to
travel on nerves where there are nerve fibres and in

pace where the nerves are lacking whereas the others
are possessed of an apparatus that sends over nerve
fibres only

  now if we can find a way to convey messages to the
nerve centers and ganglia of an animal in such a way that
they will come in stronger than those from the animals
own brain we can control the actions of the animals
body

  suppose a dog is standing with one foot raised off
the ground there will be messages coming from the
motive part of the brain to the ganglion and nerve center
through which the nerves pass governing that foot say-
ing in substance keep that foot up

  but if we can send a stronger more impressive mes-
sage saying put that foot down the foot will go down
and mr dog can like it or not

   i wish you would go a little easy on that buttermilk
i said with mock gravity i am really afraid it is af-
fecting your mind

  in spite of my little joke i was conscious-perhaps
more strikingly than ever before-of being in the pres-
ence of a superior mind

  i was convinced that a great realm which to me was
dark and full of the deep secrets of life was to him an
open book

  and now some years had passed mr kingstons
company of which he was still a vice-president had
undertaken to construct the long-projected tube from
england to france and my old-time friend was in
charge of operations under the title of chief engineer
which brings us back to the afternoon when my story
opened

  this extraordinary scientist mused a few moments
ora my declaration that my part in the early discovery
had been a mere accident

  yes he said there was an element of chance in-
volved to be sure but almost all discoveries have been
to some extent due to chance look at the way the chinese
discovered roast pig this is cleverly told by charles
lamb in his essays of elia

  but usually the accident doesnt mean anything un-
less one has a theory first you had a theory and the
accident only served to verify it

  the important part of the accident was that you
happened to be there to see it i rejoined had it not
been so the most that could have come of it would have
been a rather carefully worded report to the entomologi-
cal society

  well kingston said the good old tube is more

d etecti ve

u it became quite obvious when i
looked at the bird that the mur-
der had been committed before
the bird was killed

rpke touraco a rare bird of africa has been a sub-
- jecl of much debate among ornithologists it is sup-
posed to be the only bird whose feathers yield on wet-
ting a natural red pigment at any rate mr verrill
who needs no further introduction to readers of amaz-
ing stories has some definite theories on this subject
based on careful study and investigation and under
his skilful handling the feathered detective takes on
an individuality that easily puts it on an equal footing
with the best scientific detective story

ben pollard owned the blue lion inn at
hobham but nobody in the village really knew
anything about big ben as he was called not
that there was any question that he owned the
blue lion for he had bought it from old john
blaber paying for it with good bank of england notes
and gold sovereigns it had been the white lion

then and big bens first act after the bill of sale and
the deeds had been signed was characteristic of the man

cocking his head to one side thumbs in the armholes
of his waistcoat he had squinted up at the weather-
beaten sign with its white lion rampant on a faded black
background

white lion he had observed speaking to no one




the feathered detective

in particular white lions and black lions all about
ill lay a quid to a farthing theres one in the next
village

  two on em vouchsafed old andy prout nodding
his bald head sagely an anither to clacton

  aye an one over to ripley an the black lion to
church poges added sam ryder aye thes plenty
on em hereabout

  big ben spat thickern ticks on a sheep he rum-
bled white lions and black lions and red lions
all over the bloomin place i aint never seed a willage
without em an im a keen un for pubs at that but
never a blue lion nowheres an this pubs agoin to
be the blue lion arter now aye ill bet two quid to
a hapenny there bent another blue lion in the whole
united kingdom o englan irelan scotian an wales
so one o ye run along an fetch the sign-painter for to
paint yon lion blue once an for all an mind theres
a hapint to the lad as gets here with him first

  stfll as i said in the beginning nobody really knew
anything about big ben who he was whence he came
or even if his name really was ben pollard he had
arrived on the portsmouth motor-coach one wild night
bundled up in a great sea-coat against the wind and
slashing rain carrying a bulging black portmanteau
and a big parrot cage wrapped in newspapers to pro-
tect the green bird inside

  he had taken up his quarters at blabers inn and
though the villagers had been a bit curious as village
folk are they hadnt learned anything about the man
during the months he had lived there hie was a free
spender seemed to have plenty of money and being a
genial soul always ready to buy a pint for anyone ready
to pass an hour with him he was accepted at his face
value and was generally liked

  he was a big man well over six feet and weighing
all of fifteen stone two hundred and ten pounds
broad and thick with a trick of standing with legs wide-
spread and head cocked to one side-like a bloomin
sailor as johnny handy put it his face was tanned
his nose sharp and crooked a bit to one side and he wore
a short crisp beard that like his thick tousled hair was
flaming red streaked a bit with gray

  old abner spree claimed to be over one hundred
years old and had been to sea as a young man he said
if it had been seventy-five years ago hed have sworn
big ben was a bloody pirate and he got very reminis-
cent and spent the whole evening telling stories of days
when he was at sea and the adventures hed had no
one doubted that big ben had been a sailor but no one
asked him for good-natured as he was and liked as he
was by all still there was that about him that made a
body hesitate to pry into his affairs or ask personal
questions

  and he was a man of very regular habits every
morning he was up before sun-up and carrying a heavy
stick that was near to being a club and dressed in harris
tweeds hed go for a long walk through the fields and
spinneys manys the time ive met him as i was driv-
ing to guildford or to kingston striding along as though
he were walking on a wager whistling or puffing furi-
ously at his big black pipe or id see him sitting on a
stile or a rock maybe watching a flock of rooks or gaz-
ing up at a singing lark or maybe as intent on studying
some bug or tree as one of the scientific chaps from
kensington

  regular as a clock too hed be off to london start-
ing by the first motor-coach in the morning and getting
back in the evening and always with a black leather bag
in his hand what he did in london nobody knew but
we all thought likely twas to his bank he went for
blabers inn had always had a good trade betwixt
the folks round about and the tourists forever passing
back and forth on the portsmouth road or stopping off
to see the old houses and the church and what not at
street hobham and since big ben had owned the inn
the business had picked up most amazingly he had his
beer and ale cold-that pleased the american tourists
immensely-and there wasnt a pub twixt portsmouth
and london could old a candle to the blue lion for
food moreover big ben had fixed up the old place
till twas like a museum to see what with heads of foxes
and red deer and stags and stuffed pheasants and birds
and big pike and salmon on panels on the walls and
rusty old guns and swords and what not together with
ugly idols from lord knows where and curios from
foreign parts

  a great hand he was for collecting this that and the
other buying old junk in the way of chairs and tables
and settees and old pewter and china and there was
his parrot in its cage a fine green bird big as a pigeon
though whatsoever he wanted her for i dont know for
she never talked but croaked and whistled a bit and
screamed fit to deafen one but the place was cozy
and big ben had the neatest bit of a barmaid that eyes
could see-a pert bright-eyed laughing lass with hair as
red as is own but a right proper girl at that

  so taken altogether the place did a right roaring
trade and the silver came in fast and big ben had every
reason to go to london to bank his savings every week

  still twas queer as we often remarked that when-
ever strangers were about and the tap-room and bar-
parlour were crowded big ben never was about hed
be sitting alone or with a crony or two in the little back
room with a mug of mulled ale or maybe arf an arf
and his big black pipe and most often with his coat off
and his shirt open showing his hairy chest with a bit of
blue tattoo on it hed be as chummy as is but never
did i know him to tell a word of his past or a tale of
the sea or of the foreign parts he must have been to
now and again some one of us would try a bit to draw
him out mentioning this that or the other thing quite
casually or maybe speaking of something wed read in
the press about some foreign place or even getting old
man spree to start in on his everlasting stories wed
heard a thousand times and more but it wasnt any
use big bend nod his head or maybe roar with laugh-
ter till the mugs rattled and swear twas marvelous or
past belief but never a yes nor a no nor a when i was
to this that or the other place i mind one day that
tom dickey asked him about that parrot of his asked
what big ben kept her for as she didnt say so much
as damn and then asked where he got her

  them as talks least says the most sense said big
ben cocking his ead one side and peering at te bird
with eyes half shut and shes a wery remarkable poll
at that he goes on in fact he says the most re-
markable parrot in the world i might say of course
ye cant see it he says neither can a lad see anything
so remarkable in another lads sweetheart though hell
think there be none like her on earth tis the same
with her-jerking his thumb towards the cage hanging
the feathered detective



in the window but he never answered toms question
about where he got hold of the bird i noticed

but he must have told the truth about her being so
remarkable for one day a party from america was
stopping in at the blue lion and having their ale and
bitters and what not as they waited for luncheon and
one of them-a nervous thin old fellow in knickers and
with goggles jumps up and goes over to the bird hang-
ing in the sun my goodness  he exclaims for i
was in the bar having a drink and a chat with bess and
i heard him my goodness gracious  he says a second
time where on earth did these people get hold of this
bird why as true as i live its a touraco a most
remarkable specimen and the only one ive ever seen
in confinement

  one of the ladies laughed why professor she
said it seems just a common green parrot to me
whats so remarkable about the creature

  the old fellow snorted and those worm-eaten old
chairs you raved over this morning looked just like
any ordinary old chairs to me he told her back what
was so remarkable about them id like to know 
why why they were old-they were antiques and
very very rare she says

  exactly snaps the one shed called professor
well this bird is not old and he is not antique but
hes very very and then again very rare if you want
to know in fact it is quite the most remarkable bird
i have ever seen and well worth my visit to england
oh do lets buy the precious thing then says an-
other lady im having my boudoir all finished in just
that delightful shade of green and the dear bird will be
in perfect harmony

  but i expect big ben must have been listening also
or maybe the waitress or someone told him for just
then jimmy the porter comes in and takes the bird cage
and all and starts to go out but the professor stops
him

  will you inquire of the owner of the bird if he will
dispose of it and for how much he says to jimmy

  but jimmy comes back and tells the professor that
the owner doesnt care to part with the parrot at which
the lady with the green boudoir laughs and says she has
never yet found anything that money wont buy and
will five hundred pounds make the birds owner change
his mind jimmys eyes fairly popped out of his head
at tliat and i came near to spilling my bitters and
grabbed at bess for support i was that put out about
hearing the lady offering five hundred quid for a green
parrot that i didnt even talk mind where youre put-
ting your hand snaps bess giving me a smart slap
but my gawd she said that as easy as id say six-
pence 

  and when jimmy comes back and says as how the
owner-meaning big ben of course-wouldnt sell not
for five hundred nor for five thousand pounds bess
grabbed me and i didnt ask her to mind where her
hands were nor slap her you may be sure and for the
matter of that neither of us noticed we were that
amazed to think big ben put so much store by his par-
rot that couldnt say boo well the upshot of it was
that big bens green parrot became right famous-what
with everyone talking about his having refused five hun-
dred pounds for the bird-and everyone would drop
into the blue lion just to have a look at the bird and

of course theyd have their drinks and as i told sam
ryder and the others agreed big ben wasnt such a
fool as wed thought to refuse the american ladys
offer because he was making more out of the bird being
so famous than hed have got from her-that is if the
parrot didnt die on him

  but of course there was a bit of gossip going about
too a man who could refuse five hundred quid-or
five thousand he said-as easy as is must be rich and
even with all that he was making at the blue lion it
began to get about that big ben had a tidy bit of gold
of course it was nobodys business he had as much
right to money as the next and for all anyone knew
he might have got it in the gold fields somewhere or
by honest work or saving or any other way but theres
no place like a village for gossip as you know and folks
began to recollect how he came to hobham how he
paid for the inn with gold pieces and that they really
didnt know anything about the man

  now id known him ever since hed come and i hadnt
noticed anything strange nor mysterious about him-ex-
cept maybe his not wishing to be about among strangers
which wasnt mysterious but just natural seeing how
he preferred going about without his coat and collar
and was never one to dress up but others said his
trips to london were suspicious though lord knows
why and that he might have been a robber or a bandit
or a gambler or some sort of a scoundrel before he
came to hobham and why didnt he have friends or
ever get letters and when the maid at the blue lion
told mrs gregg that she never in all the time ben had
been there had seen his big portmanteau open but that
it always was kept locked and said he always kept a
loaded pistol in his room everyone began to say big
had a past and kept some secret locked up in the
portmanteau

  there were some of us laughed at this talk-i did
and sam ryder and two or three others who knew big
ben pretty well-that is as well as anyone in the vil-
lage knew him but old andy prout and doddering old
man spree shook their heads and said they wouldnt be
a bit surprised if big ben had been a pirate or some-
thing worse

  it was about this time that a stranger came to bren-
tons heath and put up at the old bear there i was
over to the heath the day he came and at first sight
i gasped like a fish out of water for back-to as i saw
him when he got off the bus he was so like big ben
i thought twas he himself though i knew he was over
to the blue lion at the same time yes sir the stranger
was the same build as big ben-broad as an ox tall
and he even had the red hair but he was a younger
man i could see as he turned about there was no
gray in his hair and no beard but the same sort of
nose and tanned like hed been long at sea or in some
hot land and with a big ugly white scar running across
one cheek and making his mouth turn up at the right
side as if he was ever grinning on one side of his mouth
he walked like a sailor too legs spread but didnt cock
his head aside like big ben i dont know a i can quite
make it clear but somehow i got the idea that while
big ben was a good-natured easy-going good-hearted
chap even if a bit rough in his ways this fellow at the
old bear was a nasty dispositioned surly sort and one
as wouldnt stand for any humbugging or nonsense
still he spoke fair enough as he tipped the porter for


amazing stories

carrying in his bag a black portmanteau as like big
bens as two peas in a pod yes aside from the beard
and he being a younger man id have said he and big
ben might have been twin brothers but there was
one thing this man didnt bring a parrot with him

  well i had it in mind to mention him to big ben
when i got back to hobham thought hed be interested
in knowing there was a stranger so like him over at the
old bear but what with one thing and another i clean
forgot it and i didnt think of the stranger again till
the next day when big ben being off to london and
i dropping in to have a mug of ale and a word with
bess who should come into the blue lion but the
stranger from over to the old bear i didnt like the
way he leered and winked at bess who was a right
proper lass as ive said and not one to be free with
but he spoke civilly enough and ordering a gin and
it sat himself down on a settle and lit his pipe

  maybe says he after a bit you may know if theres
a party hereabouts by the name of tom henley

  i looked at bess and bess looked at me and we both
shook our heads no i told him man and boy
ive lived here or hereabouts all my life and i know
every man woman and child in this corner of surrey
but theres only two henleys i know of ones the
widow henley over to west clacton and her man was
killed in the war and his name was john not tom
and the others bill henley the constable at esher
the fellow dropped the lid to his left eye and looked
at me like i had two heads or maybe a tail or someat
of the sort pimm says he and maybe the lad
im asking abouts not known as such hereabouts may-
be hes hoisted false colors so to say ands a sailin
under another name maybe if i told you what sort
he was youd know of him a big man he is nigh
the same size as me with red hair and a bit gray and
likely a whisker on his face but no scar to twist his
mug to one side like i carries maybe for a crown you
can recall such a lad as bein seen hereabouts

now i cant say to this minute why i didnt tell the
chap he was describing big ben to a t and i
dont know likewise why bess kept a still tongue in her
head but the stranger had asked for big ben under
another name and if big ben wanted to be ben pollard
instead of tom henley it was likely he had reasons and
twas no business of mine to be telling this stranger
that the man he was asking for and big ben were one
and the same

  and i expect bess felt the same because we felt big
ben was a decent chap no matter if he wasnt big ben
pollard at that while this chap sitting there and asking
us questions wasnt the kind of a lad wed coddle to

  so you dont know such a lad then says the
stranger drinking the last of his gin and it well
thats damn queer he goes on half-talking to himself
they told me over to the old bear as how id find the
lad im lookin for over to the blue lion here said
he ran the place they did now whats the game me
lass and you me lad tryin to stall me off by sayin
theres no such man in these parts whos the owner
of this pub im askin you

  im a quiet lad as a rule but ive got my temper at
times and the tone and the words of this fellow with
the crooked mouth didnt suit me

  look you here says i a bit hotly i expect who

you arc or what your business is i dont know and i
dont care a damn youre a stranger here and you
come prying into other folks affairs and sitting there
asking questions like you were in a bally police court
and you the magistrate if you want information why
the blazes dont you go to the police and ask them  and
if you want to know who the owner of this pub is
come round this evening and ask big ben himself so
put that in your pipe and smoke it laddy me lad

  the fellow grinned and stood up no offense in-
tended says he but how may i ask you did big
ben as you call him buy this tidy bit of a place with
good gold ill warrant and where do you suppose lie
got gold me lad with no gold knocking about op eng-
land since the war in some foreign port ocourse
and how do you know how he got it maybe by hook
or by crook maybe by honest work and maybe by shed-
din a bit of some other lads blood an helpin of him-
self to what he wanted have you thought o that me
lass and me lad  have ye thought that maybe big ben
as you call him is a bloody murderer and wanted by the
police and maybe theres a tidy bit of a reward for
him as you two might be dividin for to start house-
keepin with and maybe thats why hes big ben and not
tom henley no more so-

  but he got no further bess was a quick-tempered
lass and she turned as red as her hair and picking up
an empty stout bottle she shied it at the fellows head
she was a good shot bess was and the stranger ducked
just in time and not quite in time at that for the
bottle struck him fair and square in the shoulder he
spat out an oath and started for us but just then the
door opens and in comes sam phillips the postman and
billy hart and with a glare and a mumbled curse the
fellow goes out

  whos the big lad  asks sam as he and billy come
over to the bar hes as like big ben as is savin
the scar on his face and lackin the gray in his hair
and the beard to his cheeks and chin a stranger im
thinkin

  aye says i and no welcome one at that to my
way of thinking hes stopping over to the old bear
at brentons heath

  well we thought no more of the fellow at that not
till evening when big ben come home and billy hart
who was a gossiping sort tells big ben as how the
very spit of himself was into the blue lion this day

  i noticed big ben gave a start and his knuckles turned
white where his hands rested on the table edge but he
spoke calm and steady enough

   so he says id like to see the lad as looks like me
what sort of a chap was he

  well billy goes on to describe him and big ben
turns to bess what was he doin here  he asks her
did he say where he was stoppin

  she told him the lad was asking for a man named
tom henley and said he was stopping at the old bear
at brenton heath i was watching big ben close
for in my ears were the strangers words about murder
and a reward much as i tried to forget them and i saw
that big ben for all his calmness and his easy tones
was mightily disturbed by the news but he was not the
one to give himself away not he hmm says he
tom henley eh never heard of him i havent but
then ive not been here over long do any of you
lads know of the man 
the feathered detective



  a cool customer he was no less and even if he was
all that the other lad had hinted i couldnt feel a dis-
like for big ben and maybe i thought the other had
said what he had just to draw bess and me out and there
might be nothing to it like as not i thought twas a bit
of blackmail he was trying for he looked the sort of
bounder to be that dirty and maybe he did know some-
thing of big bens past that he could threaten to tell
unless he was well paid to keep quiet but what if big
ben did have a bit of a shady past at that i thought
didnt we all have things wed like to forget and have
forgot im no angel myself im not and anyhow if
big ben had done anything much twas the business of
the police and of nobody else and as for having gold
to buy the blue lion with well i hadnt thought of
that before tis true and i doubt if the others had but
you see we all knew he was a stranger and coming up
on the portsmouth coach wed taken it for granted hed
come over seas-what with his big coat and his bag and
his parrot and all and his sailorish ways-and so why
shouldnt he have had good gold sovereigns maybe
hed come from america or maybe from some other
spot where gold was plenty and couldnt a man have a
few hundred pounds of money in his pockets without
being a murderer or a thief or a rascal of some sort
howsoever liking big ben as i did and knowing him
as well as the next me being so much about and drop-
ping in to the blue lion and chatting with bess and
what not i decided twould do no harm to tell big ben
a bit more of the other chaps words so if there was
anything to it all big bend be on his guard so i man-
aged to get him one side and told him everything he
listened mightily intent and his facc serious and then he
burst into a hearty laugh

  thanks bob thankee kindly he says clapping me
on the back  tis not many as would be as free-
spoken as you but i know tis because you think i
should know and i know you dont believe a blinkin
word of it but i know the lad over to the old bear
i do and i know his game and what hes after and i
can look after myself i can so dont worry over me
bob me lad but thanks for what youve told me

well sir that was that and me not knowing any
more than before except that big ben knew the
other and his game and the matter wasnt any business
of mine after that but just the same when nate
bronson said hed seen a hulking big man muffled up
in a cloak hanging about the blue lion after one in
the morning-though what nate was doing up at that
hour the lord alone knows poaching i expect-i
began to feel that there was something afoot and that
the stranger from the old bear wasnt there for any
good and peaceful reasons in fact i had a mind to
tell big ben about the fellow sneaking about in the
middle of the night but remembered hed said he could
take care of himself so i didnt mention it in fact
bess said id best not and she said too that twas a
kind of funny thing that ever since the other man had
been there big ben had kept his parrot in his bed-
room instead of in the bar-parlour

  maybe i said it hasnt anything to do with the
fellow or again perhaps hes a rascal and a thief and
big ben thinks he may try to steal the bird if its
worth five hundred quid as the american seemed to
think its well worth lifting

  and another thing says bess carrie that was
the maid at the inn tells me he keeps his pistols all
loaded and under his pillow now says bess

   so id do the same says i if that scar-faced scoun-
drel had been asking about me and hinting at a past i
didnt want dug up and-

  then he does know him and hes really and truly
tom henley exclaimed bess golly i wonder what
hes done that theres a reward for him

  well of course id made a slip but by now bess
and i understood each other pretty well and i told her
the whole thing and warned her to keep it to herself
but i dont believe a thing about that reward i said
if the lad over to the heath knows anything about
big bens past hes just a rat of a blackmailer do
you think he wouldnt want to grab that reward if there
was one and i shouldnt be a bit surprised if hes
the one the police want not big ben

  well the next morning i was off early for kingston
and as i drove along past fairmile who should i see
walking along the road ahead of me but big ben and
the stranger from the heath you could have knocked
me over with a feather for they looked as friendly as
is talking earnest but no high words nor excitement
and now and then laughing i was that dumfounded
i stopped the car and sat there just looking at them
until they turned into the lane and disappeared

  but that night as i was coming back late it was a
different story i was pretty near to hobham coming
in by way of oxshott and was passing the bit of spinney
by ockam dean when i heard loud voices and a curse
or two from behind the hedge of course i didht
stop- it wasnt any of my affair and it dont pay to
interfere in other folks quarrels-but i could have
sworn before any judge and jury that the voices or
one of them was that of big ben and the other that of
the lad with the scar on his face and sure enough
when i dropped into the blue lion bess told me big
ben was out and hadnt been in since hed gone off
with his stick along about dark well i hung around
a bit worried for fear there might have been trouble
for you see id never heard big ben angry or cursing
before and i knew he had that whacking heavy stick
and when a big quiet man gets mad he gets mad all
through and goes crazy like and sees red and doesnt
stop to think what he is doing and i knew if he hit
out with that stick hed just about bash in the head of
the other chap not that id have minded if he had
only i knew the police would get him if he did and
thered be the devil to pay all around what with none
of us really knowing anything about big ben and the
gossip thered been about him and one thing and another
but i neednt have worried along about ten big ben
came in looking a bit flustered and red in the face and
twirling his stick but otherwise the same as usual he
drank a lot that night he did that is for him who
usually was a most moderate drinker and he smoked
steady and wasnt so talkative as usual and around
ten-thirty sharp he got up and shooed us all out saying
as how he was tired and was going to bed and didnt
want to be disturbed and was going to close up for the
night

  that was the last any of us ever saw of big ben
alive

  first thing next morning carrie came screaming out
of the blue lion-she was the first one to be up bar-


amazing stories

ring big ben-and yelling that big ben was dead of
course everyone in the village-leastwise all who were
up and dressed and a lot who werent that is werent
dressed i mean came on the run after constable haley
bess was standing in the bar-parlour wrapped up in
some sort of a silk thing and all a-tremble and scared
but looking mighty pretty i thought and jimmy the
boots was shaking and scared like the others well
carrie between gasps and starts told how shed gone
to big bens room to take him his tea and had knocked
on the door and no answer coming had peeped in and
there was big ben sprawled on the floor with his head
all twisted to one side and dead as you please

  murder it is sir wailed carrie who was old and
excitable anyhow oh lord ha mercy on me but
i can see his eyes now sir all glazed and glassy like
an rolled up and his face as purple as a pansy sir
lord ha mercy the poor master murdered in his own
pub and such a fine generous good-hearted gentle-
man he was at that sir and now-

but nobody paid any heed to her for everyone was
pressing after constable haley except me i was
trying to calm bess and telling her to hurry back to her
room and get properly dressed for the coronerd be
along in a jiffy and he and the police would be asking
questions of all the staff and she couldnt be sitting
about before a lot of strangers with only a kimono on
and her hair down and no shoes or stockings on well
having got her off i followed along to have a look at
big ben myself constable haleyd covered his face
with a sheet but he lay there on the floor-nobody
moving him till the coroner came of course and then
i noticed that the cage of the parrot was empty and that
the bird was dead too lying in a mess over by the
window i pointed this out to the constable-the rest
of the crowd having gone back to talk it all over at the
bar and he nodded and said as how he knew but the
law said no corpus delicti could be moved until the
coroner gave permission and as how it didnt say
whether only a human body was a corpus delicti or any
body was and as both big ben and the bird had been
murdered he wasnt taking any chance of being called
off by the coroner and was leaving both corpus delictis
where he found them

  well sir after a bit the coroner-whod been called
on the telephone from kingston-came in he was a
short man with a red face and a paunch like a publican
a man named chermondy a welshman i think or may-
be a cornishman but a jolly old boy bald as an apple
and with keen blue eyes and a funny trick of saying
well well pon my honor at everything

  so as he comes into the blue lion he was puffing
and blowing and the first thing he says is well well
pon my honor the mans dead looks like homicide
pon my honor it does

  well he examined big ben carefully and kept mut-
tering to himself choked strangled he says  pon
my honor yes garrotted with a thong well well
then he told constable haley to get the body on the bed
and to summon all the staff of the inn and any outsiders
that had any information to gather in the bar-parlour so
he could question them

   ow about yon bird your honor  asks the con-
stable jerking his head toward the dead parrot the
birds been murdered too im thinkin your worship

  tut tut exclaimed the coroner how can a bird
be murdered constable  answer me that sir murder
as you should know is jp legal parlance homicide
homicide is derived from the latin homo or man
homicide means man-killing and how could the death
of a bird be homicide or as you put it murder well
well pon my word its amusing a murdered parrot
ton my word thats good do with the thing why
do what you please-throw it out stuff it eat it for
all i care ton my word yes

  constable haley was red and flustered did you
ear im  he exclaimed after the coroner had waddled
away did you ear im sye as ow hi could heat
the bloominbird  heat a parrot my heye hand just
because hi done me duty an never laid and to the
corpus delicti es a bloomin blinkin blounder e is
if you dont mind haley says i ill take charge
of the bird im not going to eat it any more than you
but the coroner said you might stuff it and being as
i was a close friend of big ben here and knowing
what store he set by the bird id like to have it as a
remembrance of him ill take it over to guildford to
the taxidermist there and have it stuffed proper and
put it in a cage so itll look as life-like as is

  tyke hit an welcome says he honly never let
me put my heyes hon the blinkin thing again

  we all went into the bar-parlour where the coroner
sat with a note-book and pencil and there before we
could get seated or begin came the sergeant of xlice
from esher and the other two constables from street
hobham and church hobham looked quite a bit like
a real police-court it did and very solemn of course
wed all come to the same mind by now that is i had
and nate and billy hart and sam phillips and bess and
all of us who knew about the stranger over to the old
bear we are all as cocksure that lie was the one
that had killed big ben as we wanted to be who else
would have done it and why  and who else had quar-
reled with him and why else had big ben kept his
pistol under his pillow  that gave me a new idea and
i wondered why he hadnt shot whoeverd come into
his room and where the pistol was so i stepped over
to constable haley and whispered to him about it and
he went back to big bens room and pretty soon he
came back carrying the pistol and with a queer look on
his face he laid it down before the sergeant instead
of the coroner and saluted

  hi found this hunder the deceased mans pillow sir
he said but has youll see for yourself sir hits not
loaded sir

  well well pon my word whats this  exclaimed
the coroner a pistol eh and not loaded well well
i must make a note of that

  then he began questioning the lot of us first
carrie the maid and a hard time he had of it with her
what with her wringing her hands and crying and get-
ting excited and having to say over and over again how
shed taken up big bens tea and found him dead and
all but with it all never a word that helped as far as
i could see then bess and jimmy the porter and
myself but no nearer to getting at the bottom of the
matter but then why should he when we all knew as
well as we wanted to that the stranger with the scar
had done for big ben twas funny i thought that
a constable hadnt been sent to arrest him for even the
coroner must have seen by now who the murderer was
the feathered detective



what with my story and that of bess and of nate and
everyone all telling of the fellows coming over and
what hed said of big ben and how id met them quar-
reling on the roadside and all

then i noticed the sergeant get up and slip out
of the door very quiet like and i thought to my-
self he was going after the stranger but in that i was
wrong for pretty soon he comes back and the coroner
then being writing and the place quiet he goes over
and speaks to him and tells him hes been having a look
at big bens room he glares at poor constable haley
like as if hed been a boy caught stealing apples

  a fine credit to the police you are he says were
you frightened at the corpse he asks sarcastic or
did you think a murder was a bally political meeting that
you never so much as looked about for clues no you
didnt even find those bloody fingermarks on the win-
dow-ledge and door nor the deceaseds portmanteau and
bag slit open and rifled a fine constable you are to
be sure

  well well ton my honor exclaimed the coroner
whats this sergeant fingermarks and bloody you
say and the bags cut open important very im-
portant i must make a note of that but-but my
dear sergeant why should there be bloody fingermarks
the deceased came to his death by strangulation-there
was no wound no blood i made a most careful ex-
amination

  as to that i cant say sir replied the sergeant
maybe the murderer cut himself or-a bright idea
came to him-maybe the parrot nipped his finger sir
no doubt he wrung the birds neck to stop his squalling
and parrots have a nasty way of nipping you know sir
at all events he left bloody fingerprints and id sug-
gest sir we have a man from scotland yard down to
take a look at them sir

  well well pon my word yes sergeant agreed
the coroner and no doubt as you say the parrot
nipped the rascals finger lets have a look at the bird
and see if theres blood on its beak

  well it was there blood i mean but not on its
beak so much as on its feathers about the neck red
stains on the green feathers as plain as is

  of course that settled it but why i thought-and
i whispered as much to bess-didnt they send and get
the scar-faced fellow before he cleared out

  but i didnt have time to say much for now the cor-
oner was standing up most solemn and imposing like
a judge in court-though more like a publican about to
make a speech on a bank holiday-and clearing his throat
and staring about at us over his spectacles

  hmm says he i find that the deceased benjamin
pollard otherwise known as big ben came to his
death at the hands of a person or persons unknown but
that suspicion points strongly most strongly towards a
gentleman who is or was residing at the old bear inn
at brentons heath and while it is not within my prov-
ince or jurisdiction to do so i suggest-in fact i ad-
vise-that the said gentleman be apprehended and placed
under arrest and that an expert be secured from scot-
land yard to aid the local police in their investigation
of the lamentable tragedy that has occurred here in the
blue lion inn i-

  beggin your pardon sir says the sergeant inter-
rupting him but the bird-er the suspected gentle-

man-has flown sir the constable i dispatched to
brentons heath reports that the gentleman who was
known by the name of lemuel henley has been absent
from the old bear since yesterday at nine oclock of
the morning sir at which time sir he was seen to step
aboard a london motor-coach sir

  well well ton my honor exclaims the coroner
this is very serious but it merely signifies delay
he will soon be apprehended have you notified lon-
don that he is wanted sergeant

  the sergeant nodded yes sir he says but-

  at this minute there are hurrying footsteps outside
and the door opens and who comes rushing in but the
stranger himself yes sir running straight into the
lions jaws as you might say and a mighty queer thing
for a murderer to do i thought knowing as he must
have that the police were at the blue lion and that
hed be the first one to be suspected of doing for big
ben

  my god he exclaims before anyone could speak
is it true is it true that tom-ben-has been mur-
dered  i saw it in the news but i couldnt believe it

though often ive warned him i-

  the sergeant was on his feet looking very stern and
officious and all it is perfectly true he says and
you may consider yourself under arrest on the charge
of the murder of one benjamin pollard owner of the
blue lion inn says he constable haley take charge
of the prisoner

  for a minute the fellow with the scar stands there
struck dumb as you might say gaping about at us all
as if not believing his ears then he turns redder than
ever and his eyes blaze and he takes a step towards
the sergeant his head stuck forward and his big fists
clenched and for a moment i thought he was about to
attack him

  you consummate addle-pated ass he spits out
me me the murderer why you blithering idiot do
you think id murder my own brother

  well at that we all came near fainting with the sur-
prise the brother of big ben but we might have
known it what with him being so like ben and all and
hadnt he asked if a tom henley was here and hadnt
he been registered over to the old bear as lemuel hen-
ley twas plain as the nose on your face now but
after all that didnt prove he hadnt killed big ben
many a brothers been killed by a brother and with my
own ears and eyes id heard and seen the two quarrel-
ing and this lemuel fellowd hinted at dark things
about big ben that time hed dropped into the blue
lion

  the sergeant must have thought as much for as soon
as hed got over his surprise at the fellows words he
says his brother you may be and then again you may
not be but brother or not youre under arrest sir
for a minute i thought the man would knock the ser-
geant down so ugly and vicious he looked but he saw
that the sergeant was in earnest and that twas a serious
matter and suddenly he threw back his big head and
laughed

  i suppose its your duty sergeant he says but
its an ill welcome for me who came here post-haste at
word of my brothers death to be nailed for killing him
when since yesterday noon ive been in london to an
hour ago then in another tone may i see the-
my brothers body he asks the sergeant turned to


amazing stories

the coroner a questioning look on his face but the cor-
oner nodded well well ton my honor of course
why not says he then

  but watch your prisoner carefully sergeant he
appears to be a desperate character

  well sir theres no earthly use going over all that
took place for a time after that big ben was buried
and a fine funeral he had too with flowers and a silver-
trimmed coffin and plumes on the hearse and all and
everyone in the village out to follow to the grave yes
and even the man accused of murdering him was allowed
to attend the services though guarded by two constables
at that and i must say he looked as sad and sorrowful
as any

the chap from scotland yard came down to hob-
ham too a slim young chap looking more like one
of the swells from the west end than a policeman but
a nice-spoken chap although having a bit too much to
say to bess to suit me though she turned up her nose
at him i must say he fussed around a bit-mostly in
bens room that had been kept under lock and seal since
the murder the blue lion being closed down with
carrie out of a job and bess at the white hart and
jimmy the boots gone to london or somewhere yes
everything set at topsy-turvy over big bens death and
his fine pub idle for you see he hadnt left a will or
at least no will had been found and the place would
have to be sold up only the prisoner claiming to be
big bens brother and next of kin if he proved he was
the blue lion would go to him though what use twould
be if he was found guilty and was hanged i couldnt
see

  but as i was saying the lad from scotland yard came
down and went back again and what he found or didnt
find i dont know neither do i know all that went on
at the hearing of the case of the man with the scar
henley

  bess and carrie and i and the others all had to appear
again though we only told the same stories again as
wed told the coroner and a great waste of time i
thought it but some of the case i heard and more i
read in the news and more i was told by constable
haley and others and most of all by young roger keats
the barrister well sir the chap from scotland yard
testified as how the blood stains on the window ledge
and the door werent blood at all nor were the red
stains on the bird that id had right properly stuffed by
the taxidermist at guildford and that was brought in-
the bird i mean-as evidence and which everyone said
was as lifelike and natural as is and youd almost expect
to hear him croak or squawk and moreover the
police admitted -that the fingermarks on the window
ledge werent those of the prisoner and a doctor whod
been called in swore as to how there wasnt as much
as a prick or a scratch on his fingers or body anywhere
so there they were with that evidence gone west as you
might say and he-the prisoner i mean-had letters
posted in hobham and dated from the blue lion inn
and others from elsewhere in big bens writing calling
the man dear brother lem and signed tom and
finally the fellow had half a dozen or more witnesses
who all swore to it that this man lemuel henley
was in london all the day and the night when big ben
had been murdered and didnt leave till the morning
when he heard of the matter so they couldnt find a

true bill and discharged him then he did a queer
thing-and what i thought was a fine brave thing for
any man to do and he wasnt called upon to do it at
that as youll see and it might have got him into a bad
fix and into gaol at that he stood up in the court and
he thanks the gentlemen for their fairness and their
verdict then he says he intends to find the murderer
of his brother come what may and he goes on to ask
why  one has taken the trouble to find out what it
was that his brother had kept locked in his bags and
why big ben had gone so often to london what he
asks was the motive for the murder robbery of
course he says who but himself could have known
what was in the bags he asks and why he asks the
court did his brother go under the name of benjamin
pollard when his real name was tom henley

  well sir this does make a stir you see theyd been
busy trying to find a true bill against him and theyd
not thought of others they were that sure he was the
right man and now hed sprung his letters and his alibi
and all so they were all at sea as i might say and
didnt know which way to turn so all they could do
was to ask the man theyd accused of murder to tell
them what he knew about big bens bags and one thing
and another and though he had no cause to do so-
and so roger keats who knows the law from a to zed
says-the law couldnt have forced him to say anything
that might incriminate himself he tells everything and
a fine amazing story that would do for a six-penny
thriller it was at that

  the two brothers had been sailors big ben having
been master and lemuel mate and trading in foreign
parts mostly on the coast of africa then one day
they get some diamonds from a native and thinking
maybe there was a new field thereabouts they went
into the country and in basutoland they find the stones
as thick as thorns on a gorse bush but before they
got off the government claps the lid on the pot as you
might say making it law that no one can get diamonds
in there and neither can they take them out

  so there they were in a nice pickle to be sure the
two brothers without a farthing to their names their
ship on the coast waiting and their wallets full of
stones that theyd spent every penny and all their time
getting and the law saying they werent theirs and liable
to be arrested and clapped into gaol if they were found
out well sir they were good british citizens and
honest seamen and respected the law but that was too
much so they made up their mind to separate and
so have a better chance-and to head for the coast each
from another direction

  but lemuel didnt make it the constabulary got
him he had the stones and though hed got them all
before the new law was put on into the gaol he went
but the worst of it was he didnt know avhether brother
tom had got clear or not not until he got free from
gaol he didnt and then he learned the ship had sailed
away and tom on it and left him with never a word
or a shilling he hadnt you couldnt blame him over-
much if he thought bad of his brother at that and
when hed worked his way to england and found tom
had left the ship at portsmouth and traced him up to
hobham where he was going by the name of ben pol-
lard and had bought the blue lion and all why who
could blame him if he thought his brother had tried to
give him the slip and do him
the feathered detective



like as not i or anyone else would have felt the
i same but when he met big ben and had a chat
though heated a bit the words were he admitted and
ben told him as how hed been afraid hed be nabbed
and hadnt dared write and that lemuels half of what
he had was safe and waiting why then they got friendly
as ever again and it was diamonds that big ben kept
in his black bag and to sell the stones a few at a time
that hed been going so frequent to london for so
whoeverd killed ben must have known of what he had
said lemuel and it wouldnt be hard to find out who
sold stones that hadnt paid duty at that providing the
murderer sold them in england and that didnt seem
likely to me well as i said lemuel might have got
himself into trouble by his story but he didnt for hed
served his bit for getting the diamonds in africa hed
brought none in and though big ben could have been
jugged for smuggling in the stones yet being as he was
beyond reach of the law why there wasnt much that
could be done only to order the strong box that big
ben had rented in london to be opened and any stones
that were in it confiscated by the crown

  well sir that was done but never a diamond could
be found only a lot of letters and papers and bank-
books and such and ten thousand pounds in notes and
among the papers big bens will which was the most
amazing thing of all when i heard of it all the cash
on hand and personal property of big ben was left to
his brother lemuel and then it went on to say that
he willed the blue lion inn with its furnishings fix-
tures stock-in-trade good will and interests to bess and
me provided we were proper married

  well you could have bowled me and bess over with
a feather as you might say all wed been waiting for
was to lay by a tidy bit for a rainy day and here we
were with a fine pub and all so we were married the
next day and thats how i come to own the blue
lion and a right neat living its brought us these many
years but with ever and all and lemuel well fixed
for life-and a right decent chap we found him after
all our misjudging him aye none better-nobody was
any nearer to finding whod done for poor big ben and
only lemuel and bess and myself much interested in
getting at the bottom of the mystery at that

  then one day as we were tidying up and getting the
blue lion into shape for business-bess and i having
got back from a honeymoon down to folkstone-who
should pop in on us but the american professor chap
whod been so excited over the green parrot the year
before yes sir there he was again goggles and plus-
fours and all

  ha says he beaming all over still here i see
and here i am back again all the time his eyes were
glancing this way and that as if looking for something
gracious yes he says here i am again but i dont
see that most remarkable bird do you know he goes
on ive come all the way from america to this place
solely for the purpose of seeing that bird and if possible
endeavoring to induce its owner to part with it im
prepared to pay anything in reason if-

  then im afraid youve had your trouble for noth-
ing sir i tells him the owners dead sir murdered
he was in this very inn and the bird as well-

  goodness gracious he exclaims what a dire
calamity what a tragedy but i hope that the body
was preserved and not cast away he says meaning i

took it the body of the green parrot and not big bens

  i nodded yes sir i tells him i saw to that
sir big ben always took great store by the bird and
i had him properly stuffed by the taxidermist at guild-
ford sir and a fine job he made of it at that but
why big ben thought so much of it or why youre so
anxious about it is more than i can see for to me its
no better than any other green parrot and its only for
memory of ben that i paid for having it stuffed as i
did sir

  parrot he cried jumping up and throwing out his
hands like he was swimming parrot oh my sacred
aunt parrot indeed  why goodness gracious the
bird was not a parrot it was a species of touraco-a
rare an exceedingly rare bird of african origin and
a most remarkable bird perhaps in some ways the most
remarkable bird for its the only bird in the world whose
feathers are actually green but actually contain red pig-
ment and this was a unique specimen a specimen in
captivity however he sighed better half a loaf than
no bread would you care to-er-dispose of the
specimen 

  hmm says i as bess kicks my shins and nods and
winks at me so it wasnt a parrot after all and
most likely big ben knew what he was talking of when
hed say twas a remarkable bird perhaps the most re-
markable bird but as to selling it well i dont know
as to that sir bess and i set a lot of store by it seeing
as how ben thought so much of the bird and as how
he left us this pub and all but then-

  of course of course he interrupts me but con-
sider that you are really doing a great deal for science
if you dispose of the specimen to me here in this
inn it will become dusty moth-eaten and will be event-
ually thrown in the rubbish while in a great museum
with your-er-name upon it it will be preserved indefi-
nitely and of benefit to the public i am-

  im not a rich man sir i told him without waiting
for him to finish but i have a good income and some-
how i dont like the idea of selling the bird as big ben
wouldnt listen to selling ifvhen he was alive but if
the birds to go to a museum then take it and welcome
i say for nothing could suit big ben better than that
i am sure sir

  well i never before heard and i never expect again
to hear such thanks as the professor-judson his name
was-gave bess and me for that stuffed green bird of
big bens and what with one thing and another and
him asking many a question i told him the whole story
of the murder and of the trial of lemuel and all he
was right interested in it all and a sharper chap i never
met no not even roger keats what with the things he
picked to seize on and ask about and all

  blood of course it was not blood he declared
when i told him about the fingerprints but it might
as well have been and whoever left those marks was
the murderer of course and the pistol not loaded
did nobody ever ask about that says he

  not that i know of i tells him it hadnt been
fired and big ben hadnt been shot so it didnt seem
to have much to do with the matter

  professor judson snorted fit to give one a start
fools he most yells fools like the police every-
where why goodness gracious man alive that un-
loaded pistol has everything to do with it where does
this mr lemuel henley live and where is this law-


amazing stories

yer-no barrister i believe they are called over here-
friend of yours have his office get them both and well
have a talk and ill wager we find the murderer soon

well it didnt take long to get lemuel and roger
keats to the blue lion when they heard about
what professor judson had said and all of us went
into the back room-the same as big ben used to use
for himself and his cronies when many folks were about
in the bar-parlour-and there we sat listening to what
the professor from america had to say

  in the first place he pointed out the unloaded pistol
proved the murderer was someone who had access to the
inn and big bens room do you suppose for one
minute he asks that big ben as jou call him would
have bothered placing an empty gun under his pillow
of course not and didnt the maid report that he
always kept a loaded gun there hence he continues
we must assume that he feared robbers or perhaps
enemies might attack him or attempt to rob him and
that on the night in question he believed that he had
a loaded weapon within reach in other words sirs the
person who plotted to rob and if necessary murder him
knew that a loaded gun was always under the pillow
and to avoid all chances of being shot or of having the
neighborhood aroused by the sound of a shot he re-
moved the cartridges from the pistol and replaced it
empty and harmless that much gentlemen we may
assume is as well established as though proven in a
court of law but who was the person

  no doubt had the weapon been carefully examined
for fingerprints when first found the identity of the
murderer could have been established for beyond any
doubt in my mind it was some employee of the inn or

some one who was stopping here that night-

  there were no guests that night i told him and
as for the murderer being one of the staff thats un-
thinkable professor i says a bit hotly

  tut tut- he says smiling at me condescendingly
sort of im accusing no one but i am attempting
to solve this murder mystery by the means of deduction
now we have deduced that the murderer extracted the
charges from the pistol hence we may deduce it was
someone who had access to the room and was familar

with the habits of his victim i-

  i dont agree with you says lemuel i admit
i expect youre right about the reason for the
pistol being unloaded but i dont see any reason why
a body shouldnt have come in from outside and have
done it he didnt have to know my brothers habits
at that he might have been looking about and found

the pistol by chance he-

  true quite true interrupted the professor in
fact we have excellent evidence of the fact that the
murderer did enter or leave by way of the window but
he would hardly have been able to enter unseen during
the day and if he had entered and had remained in the
room the bird would in all probability have squawked
and betrayed his presence for i understand that the
creature invariably exhibited dislike of strangers by
uttering its customary raucous notes that gentlemen
is one reason i unhesitatingly declare that the murderer
was someone well known to the bird

  youre forgetting the bird was killed says roger
keats no doubt he killed it to prevent it from giving
warning of his presence

  the professor snorted again and you are forget-
ting that the bird was killed after the murder was com-
mitted he said do you imagine that the owner who
prized the bird so highly as to refuse an offer of five
hundred pounds for it would not have noticed that his

pet was killed-

  might have been killed while he was asleep sug-
gested roger

  professor judson smiled but you told me he was
fully dressed he reminded us though he added
i do not deny he may have been sleeping but even
so it is inconceivable that the bird should have been
dragged from its cage and strangled without uttering a
cry and what is more i am prepared to prove by irre-
futable scientific facts and evidence that the murder
was committed before the bird was killed

  even if such proof is possible and admissible i
cannot see that it brings us any nearer to the solution
of the mystery said roger keats whether the bird
was killed first or whether the murder was committed
first has no direct bearing on the case

  indeed says the professor in that you are
greatly mistaken mr keats it has a very great bearing
on the solution in my opinion it establishes the fact
almost beyond question that the murderer was recog-
nized by the bird and what is more i am prepared to
prove in any court that the murderer committed his
crime and finding it impossible to open the bags in
search of the diamonds left the room and returned and
not until then killed the bird for fear it might give an
alarm while he was rifling the murdered mans posses-
sions

  if you could do that said lemuel then youre no
professor youre a wizard ive seen many a trick of
magic by those fakirs out east but not one of em
could turn the trick you say you can do

  not a bit of magic about it declared the professor
but let me ask a question was it not raining that
night

 stopped to think for a moment yes i said
it was a clear evening but it must have rained dur-
ing the night for everything was sopping wet next
morning i mind that when i ran after carrie to the inn
here the street was all puddles

  professor judson grinned i knew it he declared
and if we can determine the time at which rain fell we
can determine the time when the murder was committed
or rather the time when the murderer left the room and
later returned to it but the most important matter is to
learn the identity of the murderer and the fingermarks
he left upon the window-ledge are i should say our best
clue to that

  we cant take fingerprints of every blessed person in
england says lemuel and whats more whoever twas
is most likely out of england long ago

  goodness gracious of course not says the pro-
fessor but the chances are ten to one the man who com-
mitted this crime is no novice and has committed others
no doubt scotland yard could find his fingerprints in
their files im surprised amazed that they have not al-
ready done so

  im not says roger keats soon as it was proved
the prints were not made with blood and didnt belong to
friend lemuel here they didnt have any bearing on the
case
the feathered detective



  my my my exclaimed the professor i should
have thought they did indeed i should but of course
not realizing what the red marks were they would not
have regarded them as important as i do but you see
mr keats even if the red marks were not blood they
amounted to the same thing for only the man who killed
the bird could have left them and only the man who mur-
dered mr henley could have or would have killed the
bird in fact gentlemen this bird is most remarkable in
more ways than one and in this case it will be found
that the bird proved a most excellent and i might say
providential witness-an actual detective i might say
its all greek to me grunted lemuel youre tell-
ing us a lot of things without telling us anything and
what the bally old bird has to do with it is beyond me
all in good time all in good time smiled the pro-
fessor i dearly love a little mystery so do let me
enjoy it and i suggest now that we secure a snapshot
of the fingerprints and make a visit to scotland yard and
endeavor to identify them

   well thats just what we did me going along too
and leaving bess that full of curiosity as to what twas
all about she was fair on needles and pins

  so we went up to london and scotland yard and
everyone seemed to know professor judson even if he
was an american and we found the chap whod been
down to the blue lion and whod taken the fingerprints
and all but he wasnt much interested and when he
told the professor that hed gone over every fingerprint
on file and not one of them was the same as those from
bens room even the professor seemed a bit knocked
about but he was a tenacious chap was the professor
and once he set himself to an idea he stuck to it like all
scientific chaps do they tell me and nothing would do
him but he must have a look himself while the young
chap was getting out the files we were looking about
there being a lot of bills with pictures of men wanted
and fingerprints and such stuck around and pretty soon
i heard the professor say goodness gracious and i
turned about and there he was staring at a paper on the
desk as if hed found another of the green birds there

  goodness gracious he exclaims a second time
whose are these fingerprints he asks the young chap
pointing at the paper the young fellow looked at them
casually oh says he those have just come in
theyre from a bird they hooked over in notting hill
he was with another in a stolen motor car but swore he
had nothing to do with it so the police sent over the
prints to see if we had him on record here but we
havent i expect theyll turn him loose if they havent
done so already but why do you ask 

   because snaps the professor that man is the mur-
derer of the erstwhile owner of the blue lion

  what jerks out the young chap jumping up like
he had sat on a tack then he grabs the prints taken
from bens room puts them beside the others and squints
at them through a reading-glass
t by gad youre right says he seizing the telephone
now who the devil is the fellow good lord i hope
theyve still got him

   rhen after a few words and orders over the telephone
hes safe he says hanging the instrument up what
do you say if we go have a look at him so off we
went to notting hill and into the gaol and down to a cell
with a man sitting inside he turns around as we look
in and i see his face

  my god jimmy says i

  and so twas jimmy the boots

titell to make a long story short of course he was

   yy up for a hearing and of course he swore hed noth-
ing to do with it he even accounted for his finger-
prints saying as how being in and out of the room often
hed messed some red on his fingers the day afore the
murder and had meant to clean up where he left the
marks but was that upset by bens death and all that he
clear forgot it his barrister demanded he be set free
saying as how there was no evidence against him and only
the flimsy charges of an alien and a scientist with an im-
agination whod imagined himself an amateur sherlock
holmes but he didnt know professor judson not him
he didnt

   so when roger keats got up all primed with questions
written down by the professor he turns to jimmy and
says he will you be good enough to state why you left
the room after the murder was committed and before
the bird was killed 

   i could see jimmy turn pale at that but he swore hed
never been in the room

  and why was it necessary to destroy the bird by
wringing its neck asked roger keats

   jimmy twisted a bit but he swore he knew nothing of
the matter

  but persisted the barrister you must have
noticed that it had begun to rain while you went for the
knife you got quite wet did you not and who did
you hear or think you heard that prevented you from
leaving by the door rather than go out a second time in
the rain you must have heard something that caused
you to go out by the window after all

   well with that jimmy collapsed he was a ratty sort
anyhow a sly little cockney but no backbone to him
and he knew roger keats had him cornered

   he confessed everything and was tried and convicted
but he was never hanged he died in prison being as
much scared to death as anything i expect and he vowed
to the last hed never got a stone or as much as a gold
sovereign for murdering poor big ben

  but what puzzled me and lemuel and roger keats
and the rest was how the professor knew about jimmy
leaving the room and it raining and him waiting at the
door and being scared and going out the window and
all

  the professor grinned when we asked him

  goodness gracious he said it was very simple
indeed you see as i have already told you the bird is
a most remarkable one not only do its feathers con-
tain green pigment but that pigment is more or less fugi-
tive in other words it runs when wet but instead of
running as a green color it turns to red the moment
i saw the stuffed bird with the red stains on its feathers
i knew that the man who had throttled it had to do so
with wet hands i also knew that it must have been his
fingers and hands that had left the red stains on the
window-ledge and door

   it was quite obvious also that the murder had been
committed before the bird had been killed otherwise
there would have been red marks on the murdered mans
throat or clothing or on the cord that had been used to
strangle him why i asked myself had the mur-
derers hands been wet why were there red

oince the dawn of mans advent on the earth he has cut down and elimi-
nated everything-animate or inanimate-that interfered in any way with
his safe progress rarely did he hesitate in his cruelties for was man not a
superior being was he not possessed of the highest intelligence and ruling
power if conditions became reversed-if for instance a vastly superior in-
telligence in a form entirely different from the human were suddenly landed
in our midst it is quite probable that it would take man a long while to realize
what it was all about this story although written by an author new to
amazing stories reads like the work of an old favorite it is an exceed-
ingly ingenious tale dealing with the nebula of andromeda the science of
which has apparently been carefully checked back we know you will be
glad to know there are more stories by mr nathanson coming soon

illustrated by morey

in all the long tortuous climb of mankind from
the time when man was but a savage brute to the
high tide of civilization of the twentieth century
never before was there such great widespread pros-
perity it is true here and there in this part of
the world and that poverty reared its ugly head misery
and want the innumerable indignities of life-even in-
security still existed often side by side with immense
power and wealth but taken as a whole the world in
the middle of the twentieth century presented a picture
of general prosperity far surpassing any period that went
before

  truly man had become like unto the gods with
consummate skill and marvelous ingenuity the materials
of the entire earth were called upon to minister to every
want of mankind-nay even every whim vast indus-
tries linked by almost instantaneous means of communi-
cation covered with a busy network every continent
men of learning the probers after the new and the un-
tried were steadily adding to the wealth and resources
of the whole world everything on the face of the earth
under its surface in the water in the very air was sub-
ject to mans will and even with things beyond this
earth patient men sat hungrily scanning the shining orbs
of immensely far away suns and possible worlds

  one of the great tragedies of this upward surging
civilizations forces has been the fate of the subject living

things of the earth side by side with mans greatness
his material wealth stalked cruelty and want that has
been the great blot the reproach upon the character of
mankind no pity has been shown the weaker forms of
life thoughtlessly cruelly needlessly many harmless
interesting even useful creatures have been exterminated
utterly and the weaker brothers of man-they too
have not always been handled with gentleness

  in the time of which we write although there were
many signs that the world was indeed growing better
mankind as a whole particularly they who sat in the seats
of the mighty was drunk with power and surfeited with
luxury the comforts of life were everywhere fine
homes were common and gilded palaces public and
private dotted the globe the very taking of food had
almost lost its original purpose and become nigh unto
a ceremony elaborate in its ritual for many idle hands
and idle minds with more than was good for them
waxed foolish with their petty comings and goings-and
many sinned mightily

  thus after a long age-old struggle a creature called
man sat on high and at his behest moved and changed
and used this planet as he saw fit-truly lord of creation

the inauguration of a president of the united
states was going on it was a chilly day on march 
 the sky was overcast with dull clouds and a slight




amazing stories

drizzle was coming down steadily washington was be-
decked with flags and gay colors and the multitude
patiently stood at every available vantage point bravely
enduring the discomfort of the inclement weather in
order to view the inauguration ceremony in spite of the
weather the spirit of festival was in the air the entire
capital was gay and holiday-bent foremost citizens and
leaders in all walks of life from all over the nation diplo-
mats and representatives from every land on earth were
there on this auspicious occasion-nay lent color and
dignity by their very presence something of this spirit
was even wafted on the instantaneous wings of the radio
to the far corners of the world no more impressive
scene than this can be imagined than this symbol of the
glorious sovereignty of a great people this visible
splendor of a mighty prosperous and peaceful nation

   the swearing in of the new president had just been
completed the vast crowds which had been viewing the
ceremony listening in by means of numerous amplifiers
were commencing to move about when suddenly like
the proverbial thunderclap out of a clear sky an im-
mensely large globe appeared immediately over the
capitol grounds it dropped down on the plaza right in
front of the inauguration platform and in settling
rapidly - yet apparently under control - barely missed
crushing the life out of hundreds of people who were
moving about there was a loud commotion and mad
scramble to get out of the way

   great was the excitement and curiosity aroused all over
the city news of the strange happening quickly found
its way over radio and news column even the inaugural
parade about to begin and recorded as the most splendid
in history was forgotten by many

   and no wonder it was no little thing which had so
unexpectedly landed right in the midst of all these fes-
tivities at the very steps of the nations capitol it was
an extremely large globe over three hundred feet in dia-
meter of a silvery white metal and highly polished

   the first fleeting impression created on all observers
was that a solid globe of metal had come down but no
after the first shock of surprise this impression was
quickly dispelled by the orderly appearance of the huge
body and its rapid but perfectly controlled landing what
had seemed a solid sphere was now seen to be pierced
with rows of symmetrically spaced circular windows be-
sides the distinct whirring and throbbing of mighty
engines could be heard there it stood shimmering in the
sunlight which by now had burst through the clouds-a
thing of beauty to behold its weight however must
have been enormous for the bottom of the sphere which
on closer observation was slightly flattened settled slowly
through the pavements and surrounding ground

   astonishment soon gave way to impatience and then
to anger the huge globe obstructed everything in its
path for a long time it gave not the slightest sign of
life although everybody around waited impatiently for
its occupants to emerge that it was an aerial vehicle
of some sort-of that there could be no doubt the police
on duty forced their way through the densely packed mob
to obtain the identity of the parties in the vehicle and
upbraid them for their temerity and bad judgment in
landing in such a place and on such an occasion

   but here was a dilemma indeed there was no point of
entrance and no one appeared from the inside to whom
orders might be given or of whom questions might be
asked the crowds in ever-increasing numbers milled

around and around rendering the police utterly helpless
it was all very interesting but also highly exasperating
and the huge size and weight of the object rendered im-
mediate removal out of the question ihe police stood
around in perplexity

   naturally there was much speculation as to what and
where this strange vehicle came from and to whom it
belonged for here was evidently a new mode of aerial
transportation unguessed and unheard of all this specu-
lation was natural and aroused great admiration and
curiosity but there was also great irritation with the
pilots whoever they were as to their manner of arrival
-a fine place indeed to choose for a landing life and
limb was saved by a miracle it was assumed of course
that they came from some foreign country as it would
have been almost impossible to construct-much less fly-
a vehicle of that kind in this country without it having
been widely known and heralded in advance

   it was not long thereafter however when signs of life
in the huge sphere commenced to take place interest
became intense some of the circular windows began to
open inward with a screwing movement parts of the
surface seemed to detach themselves and formed into
platforms and openings appeared disclosing some of the
interior the crowds became uncontrollable and surged
forward expectantly still no sign of a human being
appeared

   just as the officials of law and order were discussing
ways and means of forcible entry a number of strange
looking objects appeared in one of the openings then took
to the air in slow circular flights around the globe finally
settling on a large platform which extended about ten
feet from the ground these small flying contrivances-
for such they were-disk-like in shape were about three
feet in diameter and on top of each guiding it was a
strange looking creature it was hard to determine which
was the animate and where the purely mechanical part
of the contrivance began

   the police finally managed to rope off a space sur-
rounding the globe and forthwith a number of these
strange beings or whatever they were settled to the
ground where they were seen to better advantage a
closer view was positively electric in its effect on the ob-
server on top of each of the before mentioned flying
disks in a sort of hollow formed therein sat or stood
or iay-it was impossible to determine which-a being
of the most beautiful appearance imaginable the body
had about it something of the appearance of a big beauti-
ful sea shell was somewhat conical in shape the upper
part convoluting gracefully and at its dull apex which
leaned slightly forward were three bright gray eyes
the rounded sides showed three arm-like members slim
and supple which were endowed with a number of deli-
cate tenacula these members they seemed able to extend
or withdraw into their bodies at will the whole body
pulsed and shimmered and was of a beautiful iridescent
color their average weight was perhaps about one hun-
dred and fifty pounds they wore various small pouches
suspended by silken cords which were fashioned of flexi-
ble metallic-like material from these they extracted a
number of queer articles some of which were very much
like writing pads and pencils that these creatures
strange in form yet elegant to behold were no mere
animated things but possessed of high intelligence was
clearly evident

   when night came on the mysterious globe scintillated
the conquest of the earth



 with myriads of lights which shone from its numerous
 round openings numbers of these queer beings flew
 hither and thither about the city in their little flying
 machines small but powerful searchlights flashing evi-
 dently examining and studying what they could while all
 night long immense throngs crowded around the capitol
 grounds seeking to get as close as the police lines per-
 mitted it was all very mystifying

  i  he strange thrilling truth at last dawned on every-

    body the scarcely believable truth that in some
 miraculous manner strange living things not of this
 earth were here before them-living thinking tool-using
 beings perhaps just as surprised at seeing us as we were
 to see them the thing was incredible unreal beyond
 belief

   for ages man and his forbears had always dealt with
 life and the things of this earth and beyond the academic
 interest of astronomers pursued his activities as if his
 planet were the only one really existing-the shining stars
 but ornaments for his edification but here for the first
 time man was brought face to face as it were with
 the outside universe what at first was thought to be
 foreign visitors in a new idea of aviation turned out to
 be visitors from another world in outer space the
 mighty repercussion of interest aroused by such an event
 beggars description it was like the first thrill of a mil-
 lion lindberghs multiplied a thousand fold

   great screaming headlines appeared in all the news-
 papers about other world visitors mars and
 venus long columns were written about the various
 planets of the solar system including a great deal that
 was speculation particularly about the martians and
 their supposedly older and higher civilization overnight
 astronomical subjects became the leading topic of
 conversation

   what was to be done  officials racked their heads as
 to the proper procedure for one thing no one knew
 how best to approach the queer visitors nor how to estab-
 lish intercommunication even with the most alien of
 humans one knows what to do-the need of creature com-
 forts shelter food but these beings who had so un-
 expectedly introduced themselves into our midst were so
 bewilderingly different so utterly unlike anything
 imagined somehow it had always been taken for
 granted-naively so-even in most tales dealing with
 imaginary life on other planets that if thinking beings
 existed thereon they most likely possessed characteristics
 of a human mold the natural viewpoint of man makes
 it hard to conceive otherwise to be sure after the true
 nature of our guests was recognized it was greatly de-
 sired to accord them the welcome they deserved to extend
 to them every comfort and courtesy-befitting this amaz-
 ing event but there was no end to take hold of

   it was finally decided on a committee to formally wel-
 come our astonishing visitors from another world promi-
 nent among the welcoming delegation were secretary of
 state george b staddard ranking republican senator

   jarvs smith speaker of the house congressman
 willis h haynes dr spencer adams of the smith-
 sonian institution dr james c goodson of the
 united states naval observatory professor russel h
 hedges the eminent astronomer professor hiram g
 daniells eminent biologist dr ernest w porter presi-
 dent of the washington academy of sciences and
 others

    accordingly the next morning at ten oclock our dis-
tinguished delegation approached the large platform ex-
tending from the globe facing the capitol where a large
number of the strangers were gathered they had with
them large scale charts of the solar system and stellar
constellations and by graphic means endeavored to con-
verse with the celestial visitors

  that they evidently understood our meaning was im-
mediately obvious for one of them who seemed to be
the leader waved a wand-like staff and at once a large
easel-like stand was brought from within the sphere
this stand was covered with white material and the
leader taking a pencil from one of his pouches rapidly
and skilfully sketched a sidereal chart of the heavens as
viewed from our solar system then pointing to a
spiral nebula in the northern constellations he made an
enlarged drawing of it laid his wand on one of the stars
of which it was composed and made it perfectly plain
that the visitors came from that spot in space

    his nebula to which he pointed was recognized as
the great nebula of andromeda designated in astrono-
mical catalogues as n g c  it is one of the hun-
dreds of thousands of extra-galactic nebula scattered
in far off space a number of the spiral nebulas had at
last been resolved in our largest telescopes and are defi-
nitely placed by leading astronomical authorities as way
and beyond the uttermost limits of our sidereal uni-
verse  in fact are distinct and entirely separate universes
immeasurably farther than the most remote star in our
milky way

   the great nebula of andromeda from which our
visitors had so dramatically come is distant about a mil-
lion light-years from our solar system visible to the
naked eye as a hazy star of the fourth magnitude viewed
through a large telescope it is one of the most magnificent
objects in the heavens it is the largest known of any
of the spiral nebula and is in reality an incomprehensibly
vast system composed of hundreds of millions of stars
similar in size and physical structure to those of our
own universe the whole system is so remote that its
individual stars are indistinguishable except by the largest
telescopes

   after further efforts it was learned that the home of
our visitors was a small planet approximately the size of
our earth revolving about a star somewhat larger than
the sun this was all the information it was possible to
get at the time from the celestial voyagers due to the
great difficulty of a mutual medium of understanding
it was only by means of astronomical charts and descrip-
tive drawings on both sides that the above information
could be gleaned

   words cannot describe the tremendous sensation this
caused throughout the entire world it crowded every-
thing off the front pages of newspapers altogether in
fact so strange and so unbelievable was all this as to
cause a feeling of doubt to persist in many of the best
informed quarters eminent savants in germany france
and other countries wrote learned treatises relative to
the subject analyzing the possible from the impossible
there was even a widespread feeling that some gigantic
hoax had been perpetrated

  for one thing how could anything within any con-
ceivable lifetime succeed in bridging the vast unthinkable
distances separating our mite of a world from this outside
universe  according to our knowledge the speed of light
is the fastest possible speed in the universe and a


amazing stories

simple calculation sufficed to prove though fast as light
is traveling with the inconceivable speed of over one
hundred and eighty-six thousand miles a second this
enormous speed is but a snails pace when it comes to
interstellar distances how then could this strange craft
ever have bridged a distance which takes light itself the
unthinkable time of one million years to span it seemed
preposterous

   and yet here was stark truth in evidence outside
of the human species there was no other bom of this
earth capable of such high powers of thinking and co-
ordinated activities the extra-mundane derivation of
these strangely formed beautiful beings could not be
doubted by all those who saw them they seemed unable
to move about without their email mechanical vehicles
which responded to their every touch on the ground
up or down in any direction-at least no one saw them
apart these vehicles were of the same metallic substance
as that of the huge sphere and they moved about in them
with scarcly a sound with no more effort than we do
in our clothes

   for seven days our extra-terrestrial sojourners of
whom there were several hundred remained where they
were efforts were made to invite them into our midst
and minister to their comforts although no one could
tell what these comforts might be beyond entering the
capitol white house and other places they did not seem
to need or care for anything the andromedans as we
named them moved and flew about here and there ex-
amining testing everything with which they came in con-
tact vegetable growths in particular seemed to interest
them highly they hovered about trees bushes and other
growths for long periods a passing dog or other animal
would draw their interest immediately they would con-
verge on it in numbers for study and the animal would

 flee in great fright

   a scientific committee spent every minute possible in
the company of the visitors seeking to learn what they
could they in turn were not only interested in our ef-
forts at interchange of intelligence but seemed interested
and puzzled at the construction of the human body prod-
ding and touching us constantly-a mildly uncomfortable
experience because their bodies were slightly charged
with electricity	fe

   during all this time very little more was learned re-
garding the andromedans their mentality and ours
seemed to offer no common ground for easy communica-
tion they appeared to have no head as we know it
no ears nose nor any other of the animal organs which
we are wont to associate with intelligent life as to the
more intimate details regarding these beings such as
anatomical functions as well as means of contact with
the objective our understanding was very limited inso-
far as it was impossible to examine them more
thoroughly

   then one morning the huge sphere gracefully lifted
off the ground slowly like a mountainous bubble and with
an immense roar of machinery floated off at an increas-
ingly great speed in an easterly direction everyone was
disappointed to see them go and large numbers watched
until the huge craft became a mere speck on the horizon

   ships at sea reported sighting the sphere moving with
incredible speed over the atlantic a few hours after-
wards word was received from belgium that the an-
dromedans had landed there about ten kilometers from
antwerp causing great excitement

   after a two days stay in belgium during which time
the most eminent sicentists of europe did their best to
get what information they could the andromedans moved
on and landed in germany near munster they stayed
there a few days causing the most tremendous furor
many journeying from england and far points of the
continent to view the strange sight with their own eyes
doubt of the extra-mundane origin of the strangers could
no longer be entertained everywhere the andromedans
went they were followed by vast swarms of curious hu-
manity often so overwhelming in their forward surgings
despite the best efforts of police and military guards
that the visitors many times had to rise into the air to
avoid being crushed

   for over a month the strangers in their flying globe
moved on stopping in russia china india and touch-
ing here and there humanity eager and all agog their
craft was continually sighted in various parts of the
world though at the last seldom landing finally no
more was seen or heard of the space voyagers they
totally disappeared as suddenly and mysteriously as they
had appeared it was assumed that they departed from
this earth to continue their interstellar voyaging and
for many years the thrilling visit of the andromedans
remained an interesting subject of discussion in wide
circles and in much print

twenty-five years passed by beyond the mere
records of fact the world had completely forgotten
the stirring visit of life from another universe a few
moving pictures of the event a few stray photographs of
their far-off homeland the visitors left behind-that was
all there was left to record outside of the knowledge
that intelligent life in a strange form existed in a far-off
pinpoint of space and the immense impetus given the
study of astronomy the world was not changed one bit
the even tenor of its existence went on from generation
to generation

   the world slowly improved ever growing more ef-
ficient more comfortable more sanitary-and even more
just but the daily things of life the good and the bad
continued just the same as they always have done for
ages back for however the outer forms of civilization
may change be it remembered that regardless of his ma-
terial improvements the inner life of man his basic feel-
ings and emotions change but little-and these very
very slowly the same old vanities the same old bigotries
the same old hatreds existed with their resulting strife
and miseries and yet there was no doubt about it the
world as a whole had grown better-much better and
happier little did the world know or appreciate how
well off it was had humanity had an inkling of the
tragic drama about to be enacted the inconsequential
things of life so important to many would have seemed
trifling indeed the soul of man was soon to be tried
with fire-his very existence doubtful

   suddenly on june   with a suddenness that
staggers the imagination the same strange beautiful
beings which had stirred our world of a generation ago
appeared once more this time however there arrived
about a hundred of their huge metallic spheres somewhat
larger even than the first one of twenty-five years ago
the immense fleet landed in open ground eleven miles
east of cincinnati

   the excitement and astonishment caused by this second
appearance of the andromedans defies description in
the conquest of the earth

-

the times of which we write mechanical advancement
had progressed at such an accelerating rate that almost
anybody could reach almost anywhere very quickly and
as the day these huge globes landed was the week-end
vast throngs from great distances motored and flew to
the spot-it takes very little to attract the multitude
many even flew clear across the atlantic to see the
strange sight once again the whole world was thrilled to
its innermost core

   that the andromedans this time had come for some
sort of important business was soon evident for shortly
after landing their spherical vessels formed into a large
circle and began disgorging vast quantities of machinery
and supplies as each craft was manned by many hun-
dreds of these exotic beings it can readily be seen that
there were several score thousand of them each moving
about in his graceful little airmobile as we called it

   a scene of tremendous activity commenced the like
of which was never seen by human eye with powerful
machinery of immense size the andromedans began
excavating leveling and building over a large area many
square miles in extent a concrete picture of what their
unthinkably remote homeland must be like began to take
form huge structures many over a thousand feet high
steadily formed to rear their vast hulks from their deep
foundations and strangely beautiful they were too so
utterly different the circle and oval the ellipse and the
spiral were the predominating motifs all their buildings
were circular or oval in shape gigantic in size set well
apart the intervening spaces serving as streets here
and there piercingly tall towers two to three thousand
feet in height spiraled their graceful way up towards
the sky they constructed their materials right on the
spot wherefrom they obtained the enormous power
necessary to their operations was a mystery at night
the whole sky for miles around was aflame with the fires
of their industry

   gradually more and more was learned of the nature
of our extra-mundane guests which the short visit of a
generation ago did not permit their power of sight for
instance was considerably different from the human
their eyes of which they possessed three were very
mobile being located at the tip of three stubs and un-
like ours they had the power of magnification which they
exert at will when focusing on minute or distant objects
in addition they had another sense which we humans
lack-another sort of an eye at the base of the triangle
formed by the others by means of which they could
register rays of the ultra-violet thereby enabling the
andromedans to see things forever invisible to us hear-
ing they had none nor could our authorities find any
traces of the sense of smell although our visitors reacted
violently in the presence of putrescence neither did they
have the power of speech which however was no draw-
back to them as they conversed among themselves by
means of signs incomprehensible to us but which their
ultrapowerful eyes enabled them to carry on even in the
dark and at great distances

   natural foods such as we earthly creatures enjoy they
did not need their nourishment was of their own com-
pounding made from the natural elements of which they
partook by means of an organ in the center part of the
body they did not seem to need the intermediation of
plants or animals for their sustenance but had the power
to absorb and assimilate and build their bodies directly
as only some of our plant life can they did need air

and consumed large quantities of water the metabolism
was very low and waste products negligible

   the most interesting thing about them was their sex
-or rather lack of sex we learned the amazing fact
that these beings were extremely long of life their aver-
age age running into several thousand years equaled in
duration only by our california sequoias death such as
afflicts us mortals is a thing undreaded with them for
their deaths are births and their births are deaths the
offspring retaining even the memories of their imme-
diate parents for the duration of their individual life
the andromedans are monosexual a form which though
lacking in interest from our viewpoint nevertheless has
its advantages by keeping their kind from division into
two highly attractive but often antagonistic camps at
a point of their life comparable to our very ripe ma-
turity the mutual attraction of two andromedans re-
sults in the beginning of a growth in each which con-
tinues until the parent usually at an extreme age is
finally discarded thus giving birth to two individuals
never more nor less or it would be more correct to say
that two partly grown individuals take the place of the
parents this form of birth is always a joyful event
and is the occasion for much celebration the offspring
at birth are already part grown or rather it would
be more correct to state that for a long time they are
part of the body of the parent gradually usurping its
entity until at a certain point the parent dies and the
children take on a separate existence this too al-
though not quite agreeable to our senses has its ad-
vantages-the parent always knows the whereabouts of
its children and the children after separation may not
have to worry about possible burdensome parents

  the andromedans although beautifully built and
highly sensitive are incapable of rapid self-locomotion
they have three appendages by means of which they can
move about but these are entirely too short and unfit
for rapid progress either through long disuse or by
nature their movement was very slow and creepy
practically every minute of their life except during
periods of rest which were very short they spent in their
little airmobiles much as we do in our clothes by
means of these they became very swift and active indeed
our scientists who were free to study the strangers and
their ways without any hindrance whatsoever found
these small flyers extremely interesting as mentioned in
a former place these were small concaved disks in which
the andromedans went about and did their  work
long ago they discovered the related nature of gravi-
tation and electricity as being basically one and the same
thing and so have been able to devise a way of insu-
lating these disks so as to free themselves at will from
the attraction of gravity the means by which this was
done was however so extremely complicated as to defy
the thorough understanding of our scientists although
they derived some very valuable ideas which it is
hoped will some day bear fruit

  the andromedans were entirely peaceable beings
we looked in vain for any signs of querulousness or
any sort of combativeness they went about all happily-
engaged in their various pursuits their greatest urge
and passion seemed to be work and activity to describe
their social organization as well as other interesting
features would take too long and is beyond the scope
of this short narrative the interested student however
may obtain this at the proper sources


amazing stories

but though the andromedans went ahead steadily
about their business of building erecting and
altering-the reasons for much of which we could but
guess-apparently offering no harm  nevertheless they
were excavating and otherwise changing enormous tracts
of land on which were many prosperous farms small
settlements and public highways all this was done with-
out previous notice or permission they simply concen-
trated at any chosen spot a vast amount of equipment
and commenced operations on such a titanic scale and in
such large numbers that one just had to move on and
so a great hue and cry went up particularly from the far-
mers and small villagers whose property rights were thus
violated without any notice whatsoever

   as the activities of the andromedans continued they
 became more and more objectionable to say the least
 and the complaints of the dispossessed and often home-
 less property owners became ever louder something
 had to be done however as the local authorities did not
 wish to be rude in any way to the celestial visitors nor to
 be criticised by the interested outside world for untoward
 action-most likely they had no understanding nor idea
 of what we had long ago come to consider as property
 rights-an effort was made to communicate with the
 andromedan leaders in order to explain to them the dis-
 comfort and grievous losses they were causing many
 citizens also at the same time the authorities wanted
 to know the why of their building operations which by
 this time were beginning to assume immense proportions

  accordingly sheriff harold s lowell of hamilton
 county requested the group of scientists who were in
 constant touch to explain the serious situation to the
 newcomers so that their stay would be as pleasant and
 non-irritating as possible to convey our desire to treat
 them with the utmost cordiality and good will no one
 at the time thought that their second visit to our earth
 although on a much larger and more active scale was
 anything more than transitory

  this approach was made but although every effort
 was made either they would not or could not be made
 to understand our ingrained repugnance to the violation
 of property rights speech as we know it they had
 none but they learned to write our language and we in
 turn learned to write theirs a deal more was learned
 from the andromedans concerning their home world
 and manner of existence and the salient facts of their
 existence ran something like this

   their cosmic system located in one of the spirals of
 the great nebula of andromeda on the far side unlike
 our solar system was a binary so common in siderial
 space it consisted of a sun larger than ours and
 around it revolved a small dark companion about the
 size of our earth which was their home the physical
 nature of their planet was remarkably like ours which
 it resembled in its make-up of land water and mete-
 orological conditions except that their planet contained
 about twice our proportion of surface land area and
 only about half of the water

   vegetation and other forms of life they did not know
   of or if they ever did exist they had practically no
   record of it for ages and ages as far as their knowl-
   edge went they were the only form of life on their
   world there being no other kind coexistent as in our
   world they found so few records of former life and
   these were so fragmentary in their nature that although
   they knew that some time in the remote past there had

 been other life on their planet it was so long ago that
 the very existence of it had been forgotten due  to
 some cataclysm or other causes of which they themselves
 didn know the origin or nature the andromedans did
 not have a complete record of their descent

   their numbers ran into six trillions so crowded had
 living conditions become for them on their planet which
 we named in our records as androm that their habita-
 tions had made of it one vast continuous city

  about seventy-five thousand years ago living con-
 ditions and requirements had become so intense that
 practically the final limit had at last been readied-
 in spite of all their science and all their art they had
 long ago perfected a means of traveling through space
 and for scores of thousands of years their space travelers
 had covered abysmal distances throughout their own
 universe and many others seeking another world fit to
 live on and always and a far as they went and where-
 ever they went they found space void and lifeless the
 infinite number of bodies it contained uninhabited and
 uninhabitable

   for strange to say although most of us on this earth
 had always taken it for granted otherwise our
 andromedan visitors informed us that life-any kind of
 life-is a rare phenomenon indeed throughout the length
 and breadth of infinite space that so far as they had
 discovered-and they had covered incomprehensibly
 vast reaches of space-there was no other life extant
 excepting on their planet androm and our planet earth
 they found our galactic universe and other universes
 although containing uncountable numbers of stars and
 other forms of matter-these were all either too hot or
 too cold too small or too large their physical content
 and form in some way entirely unsuited to support the
 vital processes of life even when they did find a body
 in itself suitable it was either too close to its luminary
 or too far its axial inclinations too oblique or its orbital
 path too extreme or the warmth giving rays were of a
 kind destructive to life altogether in short the con-
 ditions which give birth to life and permit the vital pro-
 cesses necessary for its continuance are so infinitely
 rare so complicated of such a rare combination of
 causes-the necessary fine balance so easily upset that
 life though plentiful on the two planets was the most
 rare thing in the whole universe

  the andromedans had reached a marvelously ad-
vanced plane in their arts their sciences and engineering
skill and were able to bring about enormous trans-
forming works greatly controlling the weather and
other conditions but they needed the kind of atmos-
phere we do also water and plenty of it neither could
they thrive mainly for reasons of gravity on a world
much larger or smaller than our earth

    and so when they first sighted our system twenty-
 five years ago they were impressed with the beauty and
 changing colors of our earth they decided  a closer
 inspection before moving on slackening their tremen-
 dous speed accordingly while still far away there was
 that about the appearance of our planet which interested
 them more than any other they had seen before  their
 powerful telescopes revealed thrilling signs of what
 could only be explained by the possible existence of life
 when they landed and saw that terrestrial conditions
  were tolerable for them and that above all there was life
 they were as stunned as we were to see them

at last here was a world to colonize to take the sur-
the conquest of the earth



plus population of their world it took them twelve
years to return to androm and the news which they
brought was received with great joy and relief their
world had practically given up finding another livable
globe and certainly never expected to find life anywhere
on any other than their own

  immediately a great expedition was fitted out and sent
speeding its way toward the milky way it took con-
summate skill to find again our speck of a solar system
-our sun being only one of the billions the galaxy con-
tains also the disconcerting news was imparted that
they were but the advance guard that many other ex-
peditions were being fitted out as rapidly as possible to
follow on their heels for the biologic pressure of their
growing population although very slowly increasing
had now become absolutely unendurable

  our physicists and astronomers were greatly puzzled
however by what means they were able to bridge such
vast distances in such a short time as twelve years but
as near as they could gather-for the understanding of it
required the knowledge of complicated mathematical
operations and physical laws which it would take years to
understand much less to fully master-tlie androme-
dans had a means of rapid acceleration that had no abso-
lute limit this acceleration they could increase at a
geometrical ratio till they went with the speed of light
once the critical speed of light was reached the ordinary
laws of time pace matter and velocity ceased to oper-
ate they moved as if in another dimension enabling
them to attain a speed which covered interstellar dis-
tances as an airplane covers earthly distances and
of course they were able to decelerate by the same
means in their long voyaging they sometimes passed
entirely through a gaseous nebula hardly knowing it
for many of these gaseous nebulae are millions of times
more rarefied than any artificial vacuum they were
equipped with special delicate instruments to automatic-
ally avoid accidental collision with bodies of harmful
size thus we see that the marvel of mind has always
been its ability to circumvent as it were or rather to
take advantage of the unknown laws of nature

in the meantime the andromedans and their works
became increasingly interesting and excited every-
ones imagination they were the leading news feature
the entire world was kept informed and they who could
not take in the sights on the spot saw and heard with
unabated interest the doings of the andromedans over
their televisors and radios

  but what was at first a highly interesting event-for
the doings of these other world beings were extremely
interesting and on a truly majestic scale-became in time
somewhat disconcerting for it took on all the earmarks
of a permanent settlement and as their activities
grew and spread ever including more and more area the
authorities began to be alarmed it was also feared
that some of the irate farmers whose homes and farms
were destroyed would take matters into their own hands
and resort to firearms-thereby creating an unpleasant
complication for what cared they about the romance
of other world visitors when their homes were at stake

  the local authorities scarce knowing what to do in
this unprecedented situation and feeling that it had
become a matter of more than local importance appealed
to governor whalen however as the state author-
ities neither would countenance nor wished the use of

  force it was decided it would be best to leave the an-
dromedans alone besides the general opinion was that
if kept within bounds the tremendous industry of the
strange settlers would add enough to the general wealth
to more than make up for the few square miles they
occupied the upshot of the whole matter was that the
ohio legislature approved by the governor voted
from the state treasury indemnification amounts cover-
ing the losses suffered by the dispossessed landowners
also the andromedans were enjoined from extending
their operations beyond certain specified boundaries
without conforming to our established laws

  it was soon found that this did not help matters for
long and to add to the growing seriousness of the sit-
uation some months after the first arrival another ex-
pedition as large as the first landed alongside the first
from then on a constant stream of new arrivals came
landing andromedans by the scores of thousands who
from their first center spread out farther and farther

  by the time a year had gone by the situation had
grown serious to the last degree their ever-spreading
activities reached and threatened the environs of cin-
cinnati and had swallowed up all the villages around
they even bridged the ohio and commenced their
operations in kentucky the state authorities who
had exhausted all their efforts to keep the peace were
at their wits end the situation was all the harder to
handle in so far as these beautiful intelligent beings were
very gentle and seemed totally harmless except for
their usurpation of property and land not a human hair
had been touched they just didnt seem to understand
our laws so far there had been a constant friendly
intercourse our experts aiid men of learning gleaned
many valuable processes of a practical nature the
andromedans were marvelous technicians and artists
and they showed us a few tricks particularly in the
realms of metallurgy chemistry and mechanics that
made our experts feel like rank novices just the same
we watched their activities with growing concern

  but when a great important city like cincinnati ap-
peared to be in the path of certain destruction it became
a different matter altogether things had gone entirely
too far the bewildering situation had taken on such
enormous proportions that it was too big to be easily
handled it was like an insidious growth in the body to
which growth one does not attach full significance until
it is too late everyone suddenly woke up to the real
danger and the governors of ohio and kentucky not
caring to assume responsibility for a state of affairs
which they felt had grown beyond their control it was
decided to throw the whole matter into the hands of the
federal authorities

  realizing that here was a condition of affairs fraught
with possible dynamite the consequences of which no
one could foresee the federal authorities decided to
take active steps toward a solution of the problem the
andromedans were informed in a courteous but firm
manner that their spreading activities were highly ob-
jectionable they could remain where they were as
they were already settled by contributing in kind to the
general welfare but all further spreading must cease
altogether and immediately

  by this time intercommunication had so progressed
that the new settlers fully understood our demands they
made it plain to us however that they wished no harm as
to our life and human activities but inexorable necessity


amazing stories

forced them to take whatever space was needed for their
ever enlarging population and as furthermore great
numbers of their kin were on the way and would con-
tinue to come in a vast migration to our planet that we
humans had best get accustomed to the idea right now
and live our own life as best we may without bothering
or interfering with them even though their usurpation of
land conflicted with our rights

  of course all this was utterly preposterous it was
tantamount to conquest of part of our fair land and
could not be suffered in any degree

  it was the constant arrival of these strange beings
from another universe which was the most alarming
thing about the whole business the quiet persistent
pressure of their peaceful infiltration the rapid spread of
their enormous engineering and building works pro-
duced an ever growing tenseness in an utterly undreamed
of situation they were changing entirely the land-
scape wherein their activities centered had they been
some foreign humans who had thus settled uninvited
amongst us action would have taken place sure and swift
long before this but it was the very unusualness of the
thing the unbelievable astounding happening going on
right under our very noses as it were coupled with our
first natural interest in the strange newcomers which
had disarmed us at first and allayed any apprehension

  the remarkable state of affairs was brought home
directly to the europeans also by the landing of another
large contingent of andromedans on the western border
of germany who being aware of our perplexing prob-
lem looked not with kindly eye upon their uninvited
guests then shortly thereafter in quick succession a
colony settled in spain another in england and still
another in southern russia

  our first enthusiastic reception and courtesies ex-
tended the celestial beings now gave way to genuine
alarm the situation had become impossible

  the president called an extraordinary session of con-
gress to meet the growing danger pacifists were
howled down and force was decided upon distasteful
though it was to many

  the war department was authorized to take whatever
steps were necessary large numbers of militia and
federal troops were called out under the command of
major general bruce t wallace and began concentrat-
ing about the affected district artillery was massed in
close formation forming a ring of steel about the an-
dromedans while large fleets of observation and bomb-
ing planes were held in readiness for action

  be it remembered that all this time the objects of our
concern were going peaceably about their business pay-
ing not the slightest attention to our military maneuvers
they did not seem aware of the fact that punitive action
threatened them our newspaper men and for that
matter anyone else who chose had perfect access and
liberty to the vast city which the andromedans were
building they were very friendly and took every pre-
caution to avoid bodily injury to man or beast beyond
their usurpations they were entirely peaceable and harm-
less it seemed a shame to fire upon these apparently
defenseless industrious intelligent beings who were
busily engaged in digging canals building immense
industries architectural structures beautiful to behold
wide streets paved with a shiny metal and other crea-
tions of a wonderful civilization however there was
nothing else to do

  an ultimatum was delivered the andromedans on
july th  it stated that where they had already
settled those that were here could continue as they were
subject to laws of the land but no new immigrants of
their kind would be allowed to remain that further
encroachment on new territory was strictly forbidden
that they were to pay in a manner to be decided on
later the full amount of the value of the land they oc-
cupied and gun-fire would be resorted to if they dis-
obeyed they were given twenty-four hours to comply
with and acknowledge acceptance of the terms of the
ultimatum which expired ten a m the following day

  interest was everywhere at fever heat the germans
and russians who by now each had a very large colony
of their own to deal with were awaiting the outcome on
this side of the atlantic to follow our precedent no
one really knew what the consequences would be al-
though no one doubted the ability of the military to con-
trol the situation the andromedans were not warlike
war was a thing unknown in their world our military
intelligence reported they saw not the slightest sign of
means of offence or defense although no doubt their
great knowledge and vast powers of industry were fully
capable of a great deal if given time they could be
easily destroyed long before they knew what it was all
about

  all civilians were ordered out of the district and
everything was held in readiness for the blow-off

  evidently the andromedans either would not or could
not understand our warlike intentions or had decided to
pay no attention to the ultimatum so promptly at ten
oclock at the expiration of the ultimatum the military
forces let go a terrific overwhelming artillery fire was
laid over the entire area overhead aerial forces drop-
ped huge quantities of the most destructive explosives
even poison gas of the deadliest kind was liberated in
enormous volume in an effort to wipe out the entire area
in the shortest possible time the din could be heard for
miles and miles it seemed nothing could remain alive at
the end of three hours of continuous bombardment
orders were issued to cease and reconnoitering planes
flew all over the affected area to see the result

  they reported vast damage had been done great
numbers of the andromedans were caught in the con-
centrated fire and killed but with a shock of amaze-
ment it was learned that their huge spheres of which
there were many hundreds had not been injured in the
slightest and the surviving andromedans had no doubt
taken refuge in them these spherical space flyers had
evidently been constructed of a material to withstand
any accidental shocks encountered in their cosmic flights
and our mightiest gun fire and explosives had made as
much impression on their huge craft as peas would
against a concrete building

  another bombardment was ordered this time con-
centrated on the globes their space fliers suddenly these
were seen to rise into the air and in the midst of the
deafening noise there shot forth from all their globes
blinding lightning-like flashes accompanied by terrific
thunderclaps-striking the massed artillery and military
forces these lightning flashes came in a tremendously
fast flickering succession paralyzing in their searing
heat and striking with all the force of a million thunder-
bolts instantly enveloped the entire countryside with
continuous white hot explosive sheets of flame shat-
tering and destroying everything and blowing up all
the conquest of the earth



the ammunition and explosives gathered about the
entire earth heaved and shook as if in the grip of a
violent earthquake

  the devastation caused by these electric discharges
for such they appeared to be is beyond description
men and guns lay around in indescribable confusion
many who were not dead seemed paralyzed in less than
fifteen minutes our entire artillery was completely si-
lenced and of the large fleet of powerful bombers nearly
all were brought down the remaining soldiery were
ordered to retreat to avoid utter annihilation a lesson
was taught us in destructiveness the like and the over-
whelming power of which was never before experienced
on this planet horror consternation and anger filled
everyones heart

  after the terrible destruction of our military forces
with their sickening loss of life the andromedans
emerged from their fortress globes and commenced re-
construction of their shattered area they made no
effort at reprisal nor pursuit but the way they stationed
their globes there could be no doubt that they were now
ready to meet another attack very promptly

the united states war department began to make
war preparations on a gigantic scale the general
staff met and decided on another attack this time the
enemy was to be taken by surprise all available troops
were called out and stationed in a far-flung circle far
enough removed from the affected area to avoid over-
whelming loss of life after all necessary preparations
were made the attack in force was ordered the ninth
corps and five full divisions of the second mechanized
army stationed on the west and north and the entire
first mechanized army on the east converged suddenly
on the enemy in their speeding armored cars at the same
time the main force of all-metal war planes each carry-
ing over a hundred men shot forward across the
ohio river well concealed were ranged battery upon
battery to intercept the enemy if they sought safety in
flight across the river the enemy was to be given no
preparatory announcement of the impending attack
but were to be taken on all flanks completely by sur-
prise and destroyed before they could get into action

  with great speed our forces rushed forward and it
looked as if nothing could stop them the orders were
to kill or capture every living andromedan then once
again those terrible flickering flashes commenced en-
veloping and annihilating everything not one armored
car or plane succeeded in getting anywhere near enough
to come to grips they were burned and shattered or
blown up by their own ammunition very few escaped
when the retreat sounded

  on the other side of the atlantic the germans aided
by the belgians on whose border the andromedans set-
tled had followed the tactics of the united states forces
and their attacking forces too were completely de-
stroyed the same fate befell the russians following
hard upon this news reached the civilized world that
another colony of these unwelcome immigrants had
landed in china near hankow and still others in asia
minor india egypt and morocco and from all these
centers reinforced by the constant flood of newcomers
the invaders were rapidly spreading out in all direc-
tions

  there was now no doubt about it this faroff
world in the remote reaches of space-the very existence

of which was unknown to us and such an invasion
considered if at all as in the realm of the imagination
-this far-off world overpopulated driven by a vast
expanding life-force and possessed of the power and
means-were intent on sending their millions even
their billions to colonize the earth and if need be take
forcible possession of whatever portions they wished

  the more timid among mankind counselled that these
newcomers should be left in peace so long as they were
not destructive of life but the general opinion the
world over agreed that the situation was impossible
that unless humanity wished to be shoved off the earth
as it were the invaders must be destroyed cost what it
would

a great international council took place in
london march   things had come to
such a state that everyone realized the mortal danger
which threatened the entire world every effort to re-
sist so far had been smothered in destruction and death
no single nation could cope with the power of the an-
dromedans all the civil political and military leaders
gathered to decide how best to grapple with the common
enemy for once all nations and peoples were united
the instinct of preservation made the whole world kin

  at a solemn conclave in plenary session it was unani-
mously agreed that all nations big and little should each
contribute according to their power and ability in de-
fense of the common cause an international council
of war ministers was formed the supreme command
of all the forces was placed in the hands of a triumvirate
composed of marshal francois fournel of france
charles h biggers the american industrialist and dr
friedrich hans goiter germanys great scientist the
reason an industrialist and a scientist were placed in
command together with a soldier was because it had
long been recognized that in a modern war especially
in a war of this kind where industrial and scientific re-
sources were the deciding factors military strategy alone
would not win this was going to be no mere marching
back and forth or stalemated trench warfare such as
previous wars had been between members of the same
human family naval power did not even enter into
consideration they could not be starved out here
was needed science industry-the artfully conceived and
executed application of tremendously destructive power
-to the end that these other-world enemies of mankind
should be destroyed utterly or at least be forced to
depart human civilization marshalled its forces and
girded its loins for the titanic struggle

  but every effort proved futile and without avail
there seemed to be no effective way to grapple with the
andromedans every new every supreme effort was
overwhelmed again and again and like fast-spreading
mountainous mushrooms-mushrooms with deep roots
of steel and bodies of indestructible material-the andro-
medan cities kept growing and spreading ever usurping
and extending-east and west north and south-in an
ever widening belt clear around the world they altered
the courses of mighty rivers they changed the very
topography of the earth to suit the needs of their particu-
lar civilization like a beautiful yet malignant growth
they spread and covered the fair face of our good old
mother earth

  extensive mine fields of the most destructive kind
were planted in belts miles wide completely around their


amazing stories

settlements to no avail for as soon as the androme-
dans learned of their nature the mines were quickly
blown up from a distance by their terrible lightning
forces the explosions of these mines at times actually
aided the enemy in their operations deadly aerial
bombs directed from a distance by radio were tried but
these proved more of a boomerang than anything else
for just as soon as the andromedans by means of their
instruments located our sending stations they dispatched
fleets of their invincible globes and made chaos of entire
regions poison gas of a new and deadly kind invented
by the english was resorted to and a surprise attack
simultaneously in many places did cause large loss of
life among the enemy but after that our forces were
unable to get near enough to drive home

   in addition to their shattering powers the androme-
 dans employed a wave length of the ultra-violet type
 entirely mysterious to us but which brought paralysis
 and death at a great distance to all life it touched

   new ideas inventions and suggestions poured in to
 great headquarters from all over the world every-
 thing that seemed worthwhile was given serious con-
 sideration holland flooded large parts of their country
 to stop the enemys advance but it proved a useless sacri-
 fice for the andromedans soon drained the flooded
 areas in india in northern africa large numbers of
 natives lost their lives in futile fanatical charges in
 japan two entire armies were wiped out in a vain at-
 tempt to save tokio brave men there were and many
 but humanity simply was outclassed and overpowered
 we could not cross swords with the enemy on an even
 basis it was like fighting with bows and arrows against
 machine guns and artillery

   in desperation the high command was finally turned
 over to new military and naval heads for a supreme
 effort enormous frantic preparations were made
 throughout the wide world every andromedan sector
 was to be stormed simultaneously with every possible
 means it was to be a surprise attack on an epic scale

   at the zero hour a radio signal flashed all around the
 world and the entire forces of every nation big and
 little were hurled forward to take by storm every
 stronghold and overwhelm the invaders with one fell
 swoop the attacks were terrific persistently and
 fiercely with ever-mounting staggering losses we humans
 drove on ever on there was no stopping no turning
 back savagely desperately our attacks continued in
 the very jaws of death the heroic greatness of man
 won with a billion deaths on countless battlefields rose
 to supreme heights the andromedans if they had such
 feelings at all must have been filled with admiration for
 the epic spectacle of this magnificent heroism which
 knew no let-up and defied death itself but they had by
 this time become fully aware of the determination the
 craftiness and the destructive might of us humans and
 were fully prepared they evidently expected it and
 were not caught unawares vast numbers of soldiers
 and other combatants were annihilated by their irresisti-
 ble powers of destruction all efforts were futile it
 was maddening not to be able even to come to close
 quarters with the enemy-it was like hordes of savages
 against organized steel and explosives

a great and unexpected tragedy had befallen
mankind that such a state of affairs should have
come to pass seemed unbelievable here was the shud-

 dering the humiliating spectacle of man hitherto the
 lord of creation bowing his head before a new master

  the flood of ever-arriving andromedans spread and
spread like an all-engulfing ocean steadily surely relent-
lessly day and night a constant stream of their space-
fliers dropped out of the sky disgorged their passengers
and departed they came by the millions to the ob-
server there was something overwhelming something
irresistibly cosmic about it as the andromedans
spread humanity was forced to recede not east or west
but north and south for the conquerors were extending
themselves in an ever-widening continuous belt clear
around the world and as they spread our cities and
countrysides were completely leveled and reconstructed
according to their own civilization

  for countless ages man had ruled the earth where-
ever he went all other forms of life receded before him
or became subject to his will but his sovereignty over
the world meant untold tragedy to the lower forms of
life not always were mans conquests peaceable or
bloodless in fact they were seldom that always nearly
always mans cruelty to animal life even to himself has
caused endless suffering-often needless suffering in
his egotism and power man lias naively taken it for
granted that all living things were placed here for his
special benefit-just given him to use as he saw fit he
tortured he slew-he ate his living contemporaries in
his vanity he built whole religions to justify all this
cruelty and this cruelty to life although often inevi-
table was not always necessary many harmless inter-
esting species that took ages upon ages to evolve in the
economic scheme of nature man has utterly caused to
become extinct without benefit to anyone-often for the
sake of sport have the strong always been kind and
generous what of the mayas the north american
indian and what of all subject peoples

  overnight as it were the conditions had suddenly
been reversed the tragic spectacle of mankind which
for ages had taken its overlordship of the earth for
granted suddenly found itself in the same position in
relation to the andromedans as the inferior creatures
formerly bore to mankind it is true they were spared
the horrors of being eaten and used at will as man has
done with his inferiors for the andromedans had no
need of man nor of the other forms of life but ever-
increasing masses of humanity throughout the globe
found themselves homeless and poverty-stricken forced
to move  and on always north or south families of
wealth and influence the rulers the mighty of this earth
found their property and means of sustenance gone
gradually but surely forced to the level of the lowly and
dispossessed verily a mighty nemesis had overtaken
mankind overwhelming and complete in its punishment
the good and the bad the poor and the rich the strong
and the weak the just and the wicked the arrogant and
the meek-all were engulfed in this consuming disaster

   still the inexorable spreading of the conquerors went
on east and west north and south the mighty stream
of their migration continued until they usurped the best
of the habitable globe human civilization groped stag-
gered and fell suicide pestilence hunger and exposure
took their frightful toll untold millions perished

  at last the pressure of the conquerors ceased the
avalanche had spent itself in this most frightful of
forced migrations all semblance of order all former na-
tional boundaries and divisions were obliterated all
the conquest of the earth



humanity or what was left of it became as one and be
it said to the everlasting credit and honor of man-be-
speaking the truly fine grains of gold hidden in his
make-up-that a common lot and a common suffering
united all and heroism generosity and self-sacrifice
were common

a terrible pestilence had broken out amidst the
surviving masses of humanity the vast majority
of whom were seeking to reconstruct their lives in the
hitherto unsettled temperate and arctic lands it was
a new and unknown disease quick and fatal in its effect
the air was full of it and in the disorganized condition
existing there seemed no effective way to combat the
cfcease it continued to carry off larger and larger num-
bers till it was feared that what the conquering andro-
medans left undone this fearful pestilence would com-
plete

  prominent among the doctors in siberia battling with
this new foe that was filling mans cup of woe to the
brim was dr sakaida kawamura of japan formerly
a bacteriologist of the now destroyed flowery kingdom
with a group of american and russian colleagues he
labored to do what was possible in stamping out the
dread disease dr kawamura had been the leading
world authority on bacteriology he finally succeeded in
isolating the germs of this disease gradually an idea
formed in his mind he discussed it with his colleagues
secrecy was enjoined a completely worked-out plan
was presented to the council of war ministers which
still functioned

  the plan was approved as drowning men catch at
a straw so did those who kept their heads in this
supreme hour of tragedy grasp at the new idea through-
out untold generations in his great trials one of the
saving elements of man has been the magic word
hope the idea did hold out great hope news was
flashed about without revealing its nature to bolster
waning spirits and instill new courage

  a secret expedition was carefully fitted out it was
a dangerous mission composed solely of volunteers of
all races for it most likely meant sure death each
man was carefully trained and rehearsed for his part
to be at all successful there could be no slip-up for the
enemy was sharply on the lookout at all times and it
was extremely difficult to get very far into their terri-
tory the plan of action was as follows several hun-
dred planes of the new kind capable of over six hundred
miles an hour were each equipped with thousands of
small cylinders containing the active virus of the terrible
disease-thanks to dr kawamura-now under control
as far as mankind was concerned the cylinders also
contained in addition to the virulent culture quantities
of fine steel splinters and were made to float to ground
where the slightest touch would detonate them scattering
the deadly messengers far and wide the planes sta-
tioned clear around the world each as close as possible
to the largest enemy centers were to dash forward re-
lease their deadly missiles at the right moment and re-
treat as best as they could thus it was hoped that in
thousands of places these virulent germs would start in
their deadly work midst the enemy and accomplish in
their invisible might that which the most powerful means
at our command failed to do

  after every plane had taken its station each manned
by the pick of the worlds aviators a prearranged radio

signal flashed the orders to start these brave heroes on
their dangerous mission though it probably meant
death to them it might prove the salvation of mankind
and they departed with the fervent prayers of all hu-
manity for their success and safe return

  time elapsed nothing was known of the result a
number of the daring heroes returned the rest never
came back it was learned that thousands of the deadly
messengers in widely scattered places where the enemy
lived in greatest numbers went home the disease was
respiratory in its effect and as the andromedans were
air-breathers unless they were far better equipped to
battle with it than we were-in these matters doubtful-
the epidemic should spread and being most violent in
warmer climes might destroy the hated enemy or at
least cause vast numbers to die but alas for the hopes
of humanity nothing happened if the pestilence did
get a start either they were more immune or their
science was capable of coping with it the plan failed
to produce the desired result stark grief and despair
seized everyone

frank russell hopkins scd phd for-
merly of cambridge mass had settled in manitoba
along with the rest of uprooted humanity lie was en-
deavoring to reconstruct as well as possible his shattered
life he had lost his only son and eldest daughter a
daring aviatrix in the general cataclysm with his wife
and young daughter they had fled from their native
new england home which their forebears had settled
centuries ago and gathering what meager possessions it
was possible to take moved north away from the
dreaded invaders

  a time came when it meant sure death to remain at
first great numbers finding the usurpers benignly in-
different toward taking life lingered on trying their
best to live among the conquerors but this was a diffi-
cult thing to do for our bodily habits and manner of
living were so distasteful to them that those who
lingered were at first unceremoniously pushed to one side
-in such a manner as one would disregard a nest of
ants-and then realizing there could be no truce between
themselves and revengefully determined humanity they
put to death those who resisted finally exasperated
by the tremendous and ceaseless efforts of us humans
to defend our birthright and harrassed by our constant
incursions-for perseverance is one of the innate quali-
ties which formerly aided man in world dominance-the
andromedans destroyed on sight any human being
within their reach

  for several generations the family of hopkins had
been of the typically inventive type contributing
mightily to our vast industrial progress-usually with
small recompense as is often the case the dreamer
and the inventor does not always share in the fruits of
his ideas so the hopkinses though prolific of ideas that
enriched civilization lived with modest means-often
even pinched for the good things of life

  for years dr frank hopkins had been on the ex-
perimental laboratory staff of a great industrial firm in
pittsburgh for a number of years before that he was
on the faculty of a large eastern university but finding
the niggardly pay of the teaching profession shamefully
inadequate he resigned in disgust and joined the labora-
tory staff of the pittsburgh firm he was an indefatig-
able worker his knowledge of physical phenomena was

far beyond the ordinary many an imjiortant discovery
or invention which he always assigned to his company
increasing their huge dividends meant but a modest in-
crease in his income however he was frugal in his
habits and aided by an extra commission here and there
at the age of fifty managed to save up a modest compet-
ence

  the great all-absorbing dream of dr hopkins was
the release of atamic energy locked tip in every grain
of sand every bit of matter were enormous stores of
energy which if it could only be tapped would revolu-
tionize the world for years all of dr hopkins spare
time and more was occupied with this dazzling possi-
bility so absorbed did he finally become in his great
dream tliat as time went on he became more and more
absent-minded and his daily work at the plant suffered
in consequence it prevented the rapid promotion which
his recognized great abilities might have brought him
he was a kindly soul always putting himself out for
others and beloved by all

  upon the inheritance of a legacy left to his wife the
famijy came into an independent position she under-
stood her scholarly dreaming husband for what he really
was and was immensely proud of him she loved him
dearly forever looking to his comfort and shielding him
from petty annoyances they decided to leave pitts-
burgh which they never liked and once more took up
residence in their native town of cambridge there
dr hopkins devoted all his time to the working out of
his great dream

  several times he had been on the very verge of the
epochal discovery-a discovery that would do for civil-
ization what fire did for primeval man in the dim and
forgotten past he knew all this but always that all-
important detail necessary to complete practicality
eluded him for hours for days his mind would wrestle
with the problem until weary and exhausted he would
drop off into slumber from which he would waken to
take up the subject with renewed determination

  on the bitter day of his forced migration with fear
in every heart and the temperature hovering round zero
he managed to take along his beloved instruments and
laboratory equipment he cursed the andromedans for
interrupting his researches-just when he felt that the
long years of his intense efforts combined with his pro-
digious knowledge were at last about to come to a
supreme realization but there was no help for it the
icy breath of death was not far away and with the
fear of the hunted and the driven which mankind was
experiencing in all its bitterness dr hopkins and his
little family departed in haste from their ancient home-
land

  northward in their machines loaded to capacity in
company with fellow sufferers they trekked their way
in the bitter cold of winter whither no one scarcely
knew-nor how it would end refugees from all over
the world crowded into north canada one of the havens
of refuge

  in common with some of his former townsmen in
far off manitoba-for thus far had they been driven-
dr hopkins took up die loose ends of his existence
rude shelters were built bravely the semblance of a
civilized life was carried on large numbers of people
in all walks of life were crowded together sharing the
same hardships the senseless frivolities the stupid in-
anities which formerly loomed so large and important

in the minds of many were now meaningless-only
worthwhile things mattered in this great transvalua-
tion of all values things were where they belonged and
the true were quickly sifted out from the false

  the first signs of approaching spring were hailed with
great joy and thanksgiving the relentless pressure of
the andromedans had relaxed there was time to
breathe

  once more dr hopkins took up his long neglected
researches in quest of his beloved subject of atomic en-
ergy the profound misery of those about him only
redoubled his energy and determination to succeed clear
as a bell he saw the immense possibilities if he suc-
ceeded a weapon could be forged whose irresistible
might should redeem all for lost humanity would re-
place man on the throne from which he had been so
rudely thrown his great mind bent to the task

it was a great day for mankind when his efforts met
with success the final elusive sides of the problem
were solved again and again he tested it thoroughly
positively-proved to himself beyond the peradventure
of a doubt that he held in his hand a new power in-
finitely great for good or evil

  dr frank russell hopkins stood before the august
council of war ministers-now shorn of power-dem-
onstrating and explaining his tremendous discovery
with bated breath and shining eye he explained as best
he could the workings of this infinite storehouse of
energy which he had solved at last through a combina-
tion of discovery intuitive deduction and ingenious in-
vention with wide open eyes and gaping mouths they
saw and understood they saw its god-like power and
significance carefully planned and rightly used de-
liverance could be wrung from the conquerors

  the highly mathematical technical details were hard
to understand for the layman and could scarcely be fol-
lowed even by the expert in general and briefly dr
hopkins had discovered a method of exciting the poten-
tial energy locked within the atom a way to break down
the ordinary relations between its proton and electrons
thereby releasing forces that would all but detonate the
whole earth if not properly controlled once this ex-
citation of atomic energy in matter was induced it had
a tendency to spread with an unquenchable fierceness a
degree of heat that would volatilize everything in its
path and unless stopped would continue its steady
spread until the entire surface of the earth was in an all-
consuming flame nothing could put it out the heat
caused by the release of this atomic energy would burn
fiercely for months and years burning itself out only
when the atomic energy in the surface it was attacking
was dissipated and a diamond-hard trancendentally
heavy substance remained as a residue the disintegra-
tion could not go far below the surface as the free
oxygen in the air was a necess--y part of the consuming
process

  there was only one substance which was impervious
to and could confine this all-consuming energy-a chalk-
like substance which dr hopkins had worked out this
could be easily manufactured in great quantities its
successful formula had been the most difficult thing his
genius had to contend with-the doctor had tried every
known element and possible combination of elements-
and its invention was perhaps the most marvelous part
of the whole discovery	continued on page

a human lovable man the flaming atom loved him
loved him even more because he was a cripple you see
he had been flying from new york up to the maine coast
to spend a week-end with her and her family when an

science we possess at the dawn of the twenty-first cen-
tury the left leg came off at the knee and the right at
the ankle  his heart was permanently weakened
calvroon learned of this last fact graham never made
a secret of it

a year before his crash the accident made no change

amazing stories

in their plans they had still almost a year to wait for
the girls parents insisted strongly that she was not to
marry until she was twenty-one

  flaming atom was my friends scientific pet name
for her who had nursed him back to health and life it
fitted her perfectly whereas her real name elsie damon
absolutely failed to do so she lacked an inch or so of five
feet while greene was six-feet-three with his artificial
legs she possessed a head of hair whose color closely
approximated cochineal carmine instead of the bricky
orange common to most red-headed people with her
intense restless energy and her turbulent emotional tem-
perament she thoroughly justified the appellation

  he and she and i were listening attentively to the
legal matter being discussed by paul jameson family
lawyer to three generations of scientific greenes the
aged legal man was replying to a question that had been
posed by graham

  the first of next month will be the tenth anniversary
of the disappearance of your father unless he should
reappear before that day he will be considered legally
dead according to the present laws of the state and the
fortune will go to you together with the only key in
the world to vault number three of the second national
bank which is one of the business properties your
father controlled in the vault are the only remaining
descriptions and records the notes apparatus and instruc-
tions which would permit a scientist to repeat one of your
fathers greatest discoveries the secret of which at the
present time is known to no other man you are aware
of that to which i refer

  if however you should die before the first the for-
tune and the key would then go to your fathers step-
brother elmer calvroon according to the terms of the
will

  grahams artificial limbs were so scientifically perfect
that in one sense of the word he was not a cripple at all
he seldom used the heavy cane that he always carried
with him as the three of us walked the short distance
back to the spacious well-equipped laboratory that had
been the elder greenes i made a remark about the
rather unusual provision of the will which gave every-
thing to graham and yet said that should he die every-
thing was to go to calvroon i was unable to refrain
from speculating as to the motives of the man who had
written that will my remark caused my friend to break
his thoughtful silence

  von you know very well what is in that vault the
thing that jameson so carefully avoided in his round-
about speech youre an older man than i am and un-
doubtedly you remember the events of ten years ago
much better than i do but i remember enough when
my father produced organic beings artificially in the lab-
oratory when he succeeded in the horribly complex task
of the synthesis of protoplasm when he found the secret
of life somewhere in the phosphorus compounds yet re-
member how his great work was received because he
jnsisted upon keeping his method a secret he was
branded as a fraud by the scientists of the world in spite
of his recognized ability and his unstained reputation
the others could not admit the possibility of his accom-
plishment without incontrovertible proof and demon-
stration which he withheld they would not take his
word and he had his reasons for withholding that
secret von

  graham continued in a tone that grew more gloomy

  and the people of the world denounced him either as
a fake or an atheistic inhuman meddler in gods affairs
than which nothing could le farther from the truth
fanatics made one attempt after another to kill him
believing him in league with the devil to destroy the
world dozens of attempts were made to break into the
laboratory and steal his voluminous notes and formulas
he killed one thief in self-defense

  then he put everything in that vault and destroyed
all keys to it but one which is in another vault few
people know what vault number three contains and
fewer know where its key is

  the world was no longer safe for thornton greene
branded as a fake by some and as a menace to humanity
by others after the sixth fanatical attempt to kill him
in which i myself barely escaped death at the age of six-
teen he disappeared from the world but i know hes
not dead even though hes never communicated with me
he must be alive in some part of the world with a
changed name and probably a changed face also safe
from identification still making his marvelous discoveries
in half a dozen lines of science

  the key will soon be legally mine unless my father
returns or sends some message to me i am going
to follow a plan i have long had in mind for eight
years i have been obtaining the best possible education
along the lines of biology organic chemistry and related
sciences most of the world thinks my fathers records
have been destroyed that is what he wanted the world
to believe i hope i have qualified myself to understand
and repeat his experiments and to carry them further
in secret if i find any way in which his discovery will
be of any benefit to the world i shall publish the whole
process and vindicate him in the eyes of science and
humanity if i dont i shall destroy every vestige of the
notes every shred of evidence i think that is what he
would have me do

  the next day we encountered the rhythmic toy

  elmer calvroon had been planning for months to kill
greene i do not think it was the money he desired it
was that scientific secret in the locked vault the secret
of synthetic life calvroon was a scientist too and to his
warped point of view it was absolutely necessary that
graham greene be eliminated

  but he realized that he would be suspected at once
should greene be killed the murder laws are strict it
was necessary further that graham greene be eliminated
in such a way as to leave no possible clues to the manner
of his death it was highly desirable that his death
should appear to be natural calvroon decided that he
could not take a chance with any o f the ordinary methods
of murder if he were ever to profit by the killing of
greene the crime must be perfectly done

  the device which the sardonic scientist called the
rhythmic toy was born in his brain from the union of
two entirely different memories one was the memory
of the airplane crash that had deprived the tall heir of
thornton greene of his feet the other was the mem-
ory of a few well-proven physiological facts he con-
structed the machine after all it was a simple affair
operated by a small electric motor

  on the early morning of april   when my
friend was alone in his laboratory he received a phone
call from calvroon who invited him to come over to his
laboratory and see a new invention so graham walked
calmly into the trap
rhythm



   to you who read this story not having been acquainted
 with the two men for the long years i have this action
 on the part of my friend may seem incredible you may
 wonder why he did not suspect anything wrong from
 my intimate knowledge of the men i believe i can an-
 swer your doubts

   in the first place graham was not of a suspicious
 nature in the second place the invitation was so natural
 and aboveboard that it did not arouse any suspicion in
 the third place calvroon was an inventor with 
 patents to his credit and he was rather vain about it in
 his cold reserved way it was his regular habit when
 he had completed another device to demonstrate it to
 his step-nephew before taking out a patent and selling
 the device to some firm that could use it several times
 in company with graham i had visited the combination
 laboratory and machine-shop of calvroon and listened to
 him explain with that curiously suppressed pride in
 every tone of his voice the principles behind some new
 addition to his large family of ingenious mechanical in-
 ventions the details of its construction its uses and ad-
 vantages over the previous machine it had rendered
 obsolete so on this morning graham thought merely
 that his step-uncle had completed some new machine and
 was ready to demonstrate it he went over to the other
 laboratory without the faintest shadow of a suspicion
 that calvroon fully intended to kill him in cold blood in
 order to obtain those records and notes in vault number
 three

   i had just finished a late breakfast and was idly won-
 dering why thornton greene had equipped vault
 number three with a key instead of the usual combina-
 tion lock for it seemed to me that the latter would have
 served his purpose well when the atom called me on the
 phone and announced that graham was not at his lab-
 oratory but had left a note for her saying that he had
 gone to calvroons

   the atom was immediately suspicious of calvroon
 she had never liked him she explained that graham
 had expected her to arrive about noon and had left the
 note in case he hadnt returned by that time she had
 arrived early and had found the note then she told
 me she had telephoned to calvroon several times with-
 out any of her calls being answered she was anxious
 about her fianc and asked me to accompany her on a
 visit to the laboratory of the step-uncle to investigate i
 agreed for i could easily detect the fear and suspicion
 in her voice i called calvroon myself and got no answer

   i felt uneasy at once calvroon liad always impressed
 me as a man who would stop at nothing to gain his ends
 suddenly it seemed quite possible to me that he was
 planning to abduct and kill my friend in order to obtain
 the key to life a hard and selfish man calvroon he
 wanted the secret all for himself i dont think it ever
 occurred to him to ask graham to share it with him if
 he had graham would in all probability have refused

   after i had rung the bell and knocked on the door for
 more than five minutes it opened and calvroon himself
 stepped out of his laboratory seeing the atom and me
 he inquired in a level balanced cold and rigid voice
 what do you want 

   i invented some plausible fiction on the spur of the
 moment

   i want to see graham greene i stated an
 important message has just arrived for him and i must
 deliver it at once

   youre lying von der konz besides he added
almost hastily graham greene is not here he turned
on his heel to reenter the lab the flaming atom
flared up angrily

   youre lying he is here

   before he could stop her she had darted past him into
 the laboratory calvroon turned silently and followed
 her trying to slam the door in my face but i was in as
 soon as he was the atom was throwing open a heavy
 icebox door at one end of the room a door that was
 obviously soundproof as was the room to which it gave
 ingress calvroon had apparently come out of this room
 to answer the bell and had left the door open a fraction
 of an inch

   in two seconds the cold-blooded madman at my side
 produced a small derringer pistol the type that fires those
 murderous mushroom slugs from a cleverly concealed
 sleeve holster and shot down the atom she fell in a
 little heap in the doorway i made an involuntary mo-
 tion toward calvroon and found the little gun with the
 big bore looking me in the eye calvroons eyelids
 drooped a little as he enunciated his threat

   if you move one inch von der konz i shall kill you
 i did not move i was not armed and i had seen
 enough to convince me that my captor would carry out
 his threat i permitted my hands to be bound behind me
 with small but very strong metallic cords then i was
 efficiently gagged

   calvroons bullet had glanced off the atoms temple
 stunning her but inflicting only a minor flesh wound
 which bled profusely she regained consciousness just
 as the man with the gun finished binding and gagging
 her

   then calvroon took us both into the soundproof
room graham greene was there gagged and tied to a
chair his face was a study in despair when he caught
sight of the girl with the red blood slowly dripping from
her temple he made one mighty but ineffectual effort
to free himself calvroon used the gun to persuade me
to submit to being bound to another chair then he took
the kicking struggling gagged girl from her lovers side
and bound her to a third chair finally he stood off and
regarded the three of us with an almost puzzled ex-
pression

   then the three of us listened to an unusual speech
 calvroon calmly announced his intention of killing us all
 and then proceeded to explain to us just how he was
 going to do itin precisely the same tone as he used when
 explaining some new invention it was that suppressed
 pride in his accomplishments that caused him to tell us
 his plans some of what he said follows

   when i first decided to kill you greene i realized
 that it would be best not to use any ordinary method of
 inflicting death chemistry today is marvelously ad-
 vanced any known poison could be detected all
 deaths by violence are strictly investigated and i real-
 ized that i would immediately be suspected because of
 the terms of that will so i devised a method of killing
 you that will leave no possible clue to the manner of your
 death when you are found in your own laboratory to-
 morrow or the next day no one will suspect that you
 didnt die of simple heart failure if they do suspect it
 will never be proved for i am going to kill you scientific-
 ally without leaving the slightest evidence of that fact

 i have recently been working on a number of im-
 provements to the pipe-organ and i had this sound-proof


amazing stories

 room constructed because some officials of the hospital
 near by complained to the authorities about the various
 noises musical and otherwise that i was producing
 practically all of the time this room permitted me to
 carry on such experiments without moving my whole
 laboratory for the room is absolutely sound-proof

  in the compartment in the wall behind that lattice-
work you see at the left which compartment extends also
down into the basement are several organ pipes which i
was using a few months ago to produce very low notes
for experimental purposes some of the notes being so
low that only vibrations were produced this little
switch in the wall when i throw it will start an electric
motor which will compress sufficient air to play the pipes
though i am only going to use one note the organ pipes
together with an automatic device for gradually increas-
ing the speed of the machine that plays them constitute
the invention i call my rhythmic toy

  let me explain a few facts about rhythm why is
it that music affects a human being why does a snappy
rapid march make us feel energetic patriotic  why does
a funeral march cause the average person to feel sad
melancholy and depressed how can we explain the
effect of syncopated jazz

  part of the answer to these questions is in the music
itself the major or minor key the sharps and flats the
tones of the instruments but rhythm plays by far the
greater part in it

  the human heart has a strong tendency to beat in
time with any well-marked rhythm a rapid march has
a strongly marked rhythm that is faster than the usual
beating of the heart the heart increases its speed to
keep up with the regular boom of the big bass drum
consequently blood is supplied more rapidly to the brain
and to the muscles as a result the body and the mind
are stimulated to increased activity by this supply of
fresh blood thats why a dance tune will set your toes
twitching also the increased flow of blood removes im-
purities from the tissues more rapidly and the person
feels more healthful and more energetic

  the same thing is true of a funeral march it too
possesses a well-marked rhythm but in this case it is
slower than the usual beat of the heart involuntarily
the heart slows down to keep with it and blood is sup-
plied to the tissues more slowly therefore the mind
is sad and depressed and the body dull and lethargic

 the american indians and other savages all over the
world were accustomed to hold meetings about their
campfires and chant their strangely rhythmic war songs
to the accompaniment of the hollow note of the tom-tom
before starting out on the war-path the individual who
beat the tom-tom although he was totally ignorant of the
science involved started at about the regular beat of
the heart and slowly but steadily increased the speed
until the savages their blood surging through their
arteries had worked themselves into a frenzy of excite-
ment and courage which they did not ordinarily possess

   it seems that the lower the note the greater the effect
in a band or an orchestra one does not notice the rhythm
of the music of the trumpet or of the piccolo nearly as
much as the rhythm of the bass instruments the drum-
mer sets the rhythm in a band

  the machine that will play this organ pipe will pro-
duce short rapid low notes all alike except that every
fourth tone will be slightly accented the speed will
very slowly increase

   if i started it at too great a speed your heart could
not go with it but instead would beat with every other
note or every third or fourth note as the case might be
so i shall start it at the average beat of the heart about
seventy five beats a minute and it will slowly very slowly
indeed increase in speed until five hundred or even more
short separate notes are produced a minute but that
speed will hardly be necessary long before it reaches
that extreme rate your weakened heart greene will give
way under the strain you will be dead

  though my actual crime will be perfectly done i am
just now realizing that i have been grossly careless in the
preliminary matters i have permitted you two others
to discover me with the greatest ease i have been de-
voting too much thought to the technical side of the mat-
ter and not enough to the practical side a failing of the
scientific mind i suppose-the so-called one-track mind
i should never have been so careless

  it is obvious that your meddling must be rewarded by
death i strongly doubt that my machine will be able
to work your hearts to death in the same way as it will
greenes for yours are healthy and normal while his lias
been greatly weakened you will probably be able to sur-
vive the utmost rate of speed i can obtain but again
you may not i shall lose nothing by trying it may
save me the trouble and danger of disposing of you in
any other way

  it occurs to me now that perhaps i can put your
bodies in a radio-controlled plane and crash it then it
will seem as if graham greene died of heart-failure when
he learned that his fiance had eloped with his best
friend the shock of that double disloyalty will seem to
have been too much for him

  perhaps it was that incredible inhuman pride that
prompted him to brag to us of his clever way of killing
us that made us hate him the most or perhaps it was
the last part of his plan the flaming atom and i were
close personal friends futhermore we were both racing
pilots and had each distinguished himself by capturing
a worlds record now and then because graham greene
was my friend and the flaming atoms sweetheart our
three names were often mentioned together in the news-
papers calvroons explanation of our presence in the
crashed plane would have been very convincing to the
public

  calvroon said much more which need not be added
here we could do nothing but sit there and listen to
him among other details we learned that he had been
making the final adjustments on the machine when the
atom and i had knocked on the door he had heard us
only because he had happened to leave the door of the
sound-proof room open

  calvroon started the device and left the room closing
the heavy door as near as i can judge that was at
three or four oclock in the afternoon

  for three hours three hours that seemed as three
thousand eternities i listened to the damnable never-
ceasing steady rhythmic monotonous hollow notes that
ever and ever came faster but whose speed increased so
slowly i knew that the blood was rushing through my
veins but i assure you that i was not feeling either elated
or patriotic my surplus energy was being used up by
the fear that i could not conquer by my great anxiety
for my friends and most of all by my anger and hate
mentally i cursed his soul to hell at least three trillion
times
rhythm



  it was at the end of those three terrible hours that
grahams head suddenly sagged forward and he was
still a strangled scream came through the atoms gag
and great tears formed in her eyes i looked toward my
friend limp in the bonds that held him to his chair and i
swore that somehow i would revenge him i could al-
most read the atoms eyes in them too i saw that
determination to get revenge it had been such a cruel
death her eyes told me calvroon had taken advantage
of the weakness of his heart to kill him had tortured him
for three hours after telling him how he was to die i
was soul-sick to see the love and pity in her eyes there
were love and pity in mine too

  all during those three hours the blood had been trick-
ling down from the wound in the flaming atoms temple
the blood had not clotted very well for three hours
she had been bleeding and the loss of blood soon weak-
ened her she sagged forward too and i was glad

  she had fainted from loss of blood and the shock she
had endured the rhythmic toy had no power over her
now she did not hear it i could see her bosom rise and
fall with her slow regular breathing the thought came
to me that perhaps her wound was to save her life that
perhaps calvroon had defeated his own purpose to a
certain extent by shooting her her weary broken
heart was at rest

  but mine was not the unending throbbing hollow
note filled the room with its reverberations always it
was die merest trifle faster though i knew that it was
useless i used every last ounce of nerve force and will-
power i possessed in vainly trying to control the beating
of my heart trying to make it obey me and beat more
slowly in spite of the rhythmic monster i sweated blood
trying to make my heart obey me it cant be done

  then i tried to go to sleep to outwit the rhythm that
way did you ever try to go to sleep in a room next to
a loud and never-ceasing jazz band and lie awake hour
after hour restless and uneasy because of its rhythm
and its discords then perhaps you can comprehend the
merest trifle of the agony i endured waiting for a
rhythmic death

  i wondered if it were within the limits of possibility
that thornton greene would return from his hiding and
arrive in time to avenge his son and save the lives of the
atom and me to say nothing of saving his precious
secret from one who had no right to it but that was a
last desperate forlorn hope thornton greene did not
come back from the dead

  it was late at night when elmer calvroon entered
again the sound-proof room he saw my face and
cringed a moment from the hate he saw there

  he collected himself immediately however and ad-
vanced toward the figure of graham greene still hang-
ing limp in the chair his coming awoke the atom and
another choked scream came from her as he untied the
bonds he paid no attention to her and finished untying
the thin strong metallic cords that held the tall young
scientist

  then with a dramatic suddenness that affected my
heart more than any devilish rhythm could ever have
done the dead man stood up rapidly firmly and solidly
on two scientifically perfect artificial legs and swung a
beautifully clean and efficient right to the jaw that lifted
his arch-enemy off his feet and deposited him recumbent
on the hard floor

  graham greene ungagged himself and snapped off the
rhythmic toy

  then lie released the radiantly happy atom and his
unbelieving friend with the guttural german name from
their respective bonds and tied his step-uncle thoroughly
gagging him for good measure

  von he said will you run in the other room and
call up the police id like to kill this fiend but its
against the law i lost no time in doing as he requested

  when i returned the flaming atom was standing on
a chair with her arms around grahams neck love
laughs at trivial differences in altitude

  half an hour later when the atom finally consented to
release him for a minute or two he cleared up that mys-
tery that had been puzzling me ever since he had cleaned
up calvroon

  von my friend im sorry if you thought i was dead
when i dropped off to sleep there that rhythmic toy
would be deadly to most people it probably tortured
you terribly theres not a thing wrong with the prin-
ciple behind it but for one thing it would have killed
me quickly

   its a scientific fact von that some people can hear
sounds that others cant my ears are exceptionally high-
pitched i can hear the squeak of a bat and other shrill
sounds that the majority of people can not hear
calvroon chose the lowest note he could to be quite sure
our hearts would stay with the rhythm and it was just
below the range of my audibility i could go to sleep in
perfect comfort except for that gag in a room that
seemed to me to be as silent as the tomb

 jt must be generally conceded by anybody
 who has thought about the subject at all
 that there are many forces absolutely unknown
 to us how then can we tell wth what driv-
 ing powers and activations these forces might
 be imbued or what inimical dangers might
 be hidden within them in the concluding
 chapters of this scientific classic which might
 unhesitatingly be numbered among the very
 best ever published the author continues the
 accelerating pace set in the first instalment
 and the story is full of sound science so clev-
 erly interwoven with good fiction that it reads
 like the moon pool for the author possesses
 not only the art of writing but excellent imagi-
 native pawers as well

chapter xvii

the lord of flame

 i must have stood there many minutes lost in
 fearful reverie unconsciously i heard sam and
 xenora moving about below heard faintly the
 murmur of their conversation at last my grim
 forebodings of the horror that was to come were
 interrupted by sams cheerful hail and i went below
 i came upon xenora in the cabin she was arrayed in
 a fresh suit of my white flannels that sam had laid out
 for her and evidently she had been under the shower
 for drops of water still gleamed on her dark hair she
 looked freshly incredibly beautiful dressed even as she
 was

 i must have flushed somewhat for she laughed at me
 but she showed no anger or displeasure-she had not
 resented what i had done she looked squarely at me
 with those cool violet eyes that shone with humor and
 human feeling i read honest understanding in their
 clear depths and suddenly i went to her and held out
 my hands she took them in her slender ones

presently we went in together to sams wonderful

 feast he had the little dining room spick and span
 as usual with the windows screened and the white lights
 going to shut out the terrible red glare it was very-
 cool in the soft breezes from the fans and we three sat
 down in comfort to the delicacies he had prepared
 sam still remembered what i had taught him so many
 years ago of xenoras language so that he was able to
 converse in it itll be some revelation to the old dead-
 heads at the academy if we ever get back and publish
 our account he said they have never admitted tel-
 epathy just because the phenomenon of thought trans-
 ference depends upon such delicate attunement of minds
 that it cannot be reproduced at will of course we dont
 know just how much the radio had to do with it in your
 case undoubtedly it served as a carrying wave at first
 at least but anyhow it would be some bombshell to
 toss among my old associates

   who cares what they think about it i said
 weve found her thats all that matters

xenora sat down eagerly i found joy in watching
her eat she manipulated her unfamiliar fork with in-
stinctive culture and seemed to like sams viands im-
mensely and she ate with the restrained eagerness of
one who has not touched food for some time what
misfortunes had the brave girl been through

 presently when she was somewhat satisfied sam
began questioning her in an effort to find out something
of the strange world about us where do your people
live he began

 once lothar was an empire that girdled the central
sea but many lifetimes ago the evil power of mutron




amazing stories

 arose and our people were conquered by the slaves of
 the lord of flaine now there are but a handful of
 my race living in the forests by the northern cliffs and

 even they are taken to serve the lord of flame-

  the lord of flame what is that sam cried in
amazement

   it is a dreadful thing-a serpent of green fire that
 dwells in the violet mists of the chasm of xath she
 said hastily but let us not speak of it no man
 speaks of the lord of flame for it hears-stay oh
 horror do you not-feel it 

   and indeed at her words i felt a strange and alien
 thrill as if the revealing searchlight of some dreadful
 power had been suddenly thrown upon me as if some
 strange wind of fear had blown upon my soul i shiv-
 ered involuntarily and crouched closer to the others
 trying to drive the horror from my mind

  god sam breathed hoarsely what can we be
up against 

   in a moment the girl went hurriedly on as though to
 change our thoughts to other things many sleeps ago
 i was taken by the men of mutron and put in the
 power of xath they sent me on a ship to fight the
 lunaks we fell in with a vast number of them and
 they brought the vessel down the fire-crystal was torn
 from my back in the wreck and i was free i ran for
 the trees but the lunak caught me and that was the

last i knew until i woke from my dream of-of-

   she turned to me with a little smile as if such weirdly
 incredible adventures were to be taken as a matter of
 course i could not speak for the pity and horror that
 were mingled with my admiration for her courage but
 i could and did reach under the table and take her
 hand thereafter each of us contrived-after a fash-
 ion-to eat with one hand

   that brief and puzzling account of her adventures
 was all that xenora was able to give us until experience
 would enlarge our common vocabularies certainly it
 offered plenty of food for conjecture she had little
 scientific knowledge and when sam continued his ques-
 tions the accounts she gave of the origin and meaning
 of the strange things she mentioned smacked more of
 myth than of history

   has the lord of flame always been xenora

   no the green girl answered back in the begin-
 ning ten thousand lifetimes past the men of lothar
 ruled and there was no mutron to carry them to xath
 the warriors of lothar were very brave they fought
 the lunaks and hunted the beasts of the plain  the
 kings of lothar reigned in a hundred cities that ringed
 the central sea and there was food and joy for all

  but the lunaks were very wise when the great
men of lothar brought weapons of fire to fight diem
they went into the jungle and laid an egg and guarded
it and there sprang up the lord of flame it is a ser-
pent of green fire as thick as a mountain and as long as
a river all the warriors of lothar went to meet it and
it slew them with a breath of fire it took slaves of our
people and carried them into the fire-pit of xath

   and from that day through countless lifetimes our
 people have been worshipers and slaves of the lord of
 flame those who are taken are no longer as men but
 as sleepers walking with the fire-crystal on tiieir backs
 they fly in ships of mutron the city of the sleepers
 and rule with a heavy hand in the name of the lord of
 flame none escape them 

  well ill be d-er-flabbergasted sam exploded
 his face was a study incredulous disbelief was there
 and amazement and something of fear and horror too
 what the girl said had all the earmarks of a fairy tale
 but we had seen the metal upon her body and the
 purple stains-and we had felt that sudden inexplicable
 wave of fear

   is it possible mel it cant be its too fantastic

  i could make no answer and you xenora you
were taken by that thing i cried in sudden horror

  i was taken in a ship and carried to mutron the
 city of fear there they fastened on me the fire-
 crystal then my mind was in a sleep and my limbs
 did not what i willed until the ship fell my life was
 a nightmare of toil and terror the lunak took me
 and i knew nothing until you found me

  xenora still seemed rather weak and tired from her
 terrible ordeal after we had eaten sam and i con-
 ducted her over the ship with a view to convincing her
 of the wonderful power of the machine and thus to quiet
 her fear of that mysterious menace we started the
 engines and moved the machine a little i fired the gun
 for her edification to show how the monster had been
 killed and sam showed her how to blow the siren and
 even let her pull the cord then we took her back to
 a stateroom and turned it over to her

  as she went into the room sam proposed that he and
 i go hunting his real object i think was to get some
 fresh meat for the little winged plant but we wished
 to learn as much as possible of the fauna and flora
 about us

  i was not eager to leave the machine but we were
 armed with the best of weapons and there seemed to
 be little danger then we intended to be gone only a
 few minutes when we were ready to start i tapped
 on xenoras door to tell her that we were leaving but
 she made no answer i suppose that she was already
 asleep

  we climbed up on deck and closed the hatch behind
 us

chapter xviii

lost in the purple forest

we walked off east through the level green
meadows beneath the scattered trees that were
bright with purple bloom for my own part
i was much more interested in the vegetation than in any
game we might come upon in fact i would not have
been greatly disappointed if our hunt had been in vain

    the leaves of what i have called grass were really
 so wide and thick that it was hardly grass at all the
 higher stems of it bore myriads of tiny bright-red flow-
 ers the great trees were in shape and foliage some-
 what like the oak though the rich profusion of the
 purple flowers almost concealed the leaves they bore
 small fruits in appearance a little like the date which
 as we were later to learn were edible but in all
 the time i was in that strange world i found  single
 plant that was exactly like any i had known above

    indeed that was a strange hunt under a flaming scar-
  let sky nine miles beneath the ocean through forests
  of the purple trees that burdened the air with their un-
  familiar fragrance in search of we knew not what in
  the way of game
the green girl

   we tramped steadily eastward over the green mead-
 ows for perhapshalf an hour rewarded with the sight
 of no living thing the omnimobile had long been out
 of sight we crossed a low greasy ridge and made our
 way out across another broad smooth valley

   at last as we looked from a screen of brush at the
 edge of a little meadow we saw an odd-looking creature
 gazing unalarmed a hundred yards away it was some-
 what larger than a hog with gray hairless skin and long
 white tusks or horns it had an oddly heavy barrel-
 like body

   it must have winded us for it threw up its head with
 a peculiar squeal tossing its great tusks sam and i
 both fired we have never agreed which of us hit it
 but it slumped over on the green vegetation we hur-
 ried up to it it was quite dead it had great claws
 and somewhat resembled a sloth although it was exactly
 like nothing that i had ever seen

   sam took out his knife and skilfully removed half of
 the skin wrapping up a piece of meat in it the beast
 had thick rolls of fat along the back but the flesh be-
 neath looked so nice and tender that he took some of it
 to try for steak

   well try some of it broiled when we get back he
 anticipated smacking his lips

   let s hurry on i said weve been gone longer
 than i intended already what if xenora wakes up
 and were not there 

   let s see sam said doubtfully the wind was
from the south wasnt it

   i looked around in sudden panic i was almost sure
 that i knew the way back to the machine-almost

   the strange world about us was suddenly very alien
 and cruel the plains were lonely and flat and dead
  he trees were suddenly wild and mysterious as if
 they concealed strange monsters there was a ghastly
 unearthly menace in the red gleam of the sky

   in all directions the tountry looked much the same
 there was no definite landmark we stood there for a
 time scanning the unfamiliar panorama in the begin-
 ning of panic there were half a dozen groups of trees
 any of which might have been the one from which we
 fired it occurred to me that it would be very incon-
 venient if one of the flying plants came along and i
 began to think of other things that might happen i
 came to a tardy realization of our helplessness and utter
 ignorance of the dangers that might surround us

   the purple trees and the scarlet sky seemed to leer
 at us to gather closer to laugh in fiendish joy at the
 unnamable doom they might have in store for us un-
 consciously i drew my pistol and my muscles were in-
 voluntarily tensed so that i started when sam spoke

   of course we can see the wall of cliffs in the north
 that will give us the general direction if we can get
 up  that hill we might be able to see the machine

   he pointed toward a round bare green hilltop that
 rose several hundred feet toward the red sky it was
 perhaps mile away in the direction of the hazy blue
 cliffs he slung the piece of meat over his shoulder
 and we set out over the open field it was very hot and
 the perspiration was dripping from us i had hardly
 noticed the damp hot wind before but now it felt like
 a blast from a furnace the intense scarlet radiation of
 the flaming sky dried up our energy the steady beam
 ot heat brought over us a growing languor a depressed
 and spiritless weariness

   the whole weird region was very still the only
sounds were the soft sighing of the wind in the trees
and the thrashing and rustling of our feet in the rank
grass the tiny scarlet flowers danced before the wind
almost like little insects and a few brilliant petals blew
sometimes from one of the sparsely scattered trees

    phew sam whistled stopping to mop his brow
with the huge red bandanna he had tied around his neck
this is beginning to feel like the sahara im glad i
didnt happen to be a native of the place you bet the
machine will look good when we find it

    if we find it i could not refrain from saying

    in five minutes more we were far up the side of the
 little hill the side of the eminence was bare of the
 great flowering trees so the strange forest lay about us
 southward for many miles eagerly we looked in the
 direction that should have been southwest for the
 omnimobile

    a vast stretch of the rolling plateau lay before our
 eyes low verdant hills and vast green meadows scat-
 tered with the brilliant purple trees singly and in groves
 far away all across the southern horizon stretched the
 black sea on which we had landed glancing with the
 crimson light of the sky but nowhere in all that vast
 strange expanse did we catch a glimpse of the machine

       must be just in a low place sam said hopefully
 or i think i remember now that there was a little
 grove just north of it we will see it in a minute if
 we climb higher up

    i hope so i said raising my binoculars for a better
 look

   and we have compasses and instruments to guide

them cs arukl  wrld  wed just thou-ht to briv

    it s no use i said lets go on to the top

chapter xix
the hill of horror

         climbed up the last few yards to the sum-
 mit and gazed across toward the dim blue cliffs
 that rimmed this world on the north we stood
 on a great divide a vast valley lay before us stretching
 away until it was veiled with a faint rosy haze the
 curious checkered expanse of green plain and purple
 woodland sloped far far away to the north perhaps
 twenty miles away was the vague outline of a great
 silver lake dyed with the light of the crimson sky

   just back of the lake seemed to be a shore of low
 black cliffs and beyond those ragged peaks and be-
 neath the towering and rugged columns of blue that
 threw themselves up to the bloody sky was a strange
 sight indeed

 there was a weird flicker of dancing lights in that
 far-flung crimson mist as if it reflected strange infernal
 fires in a pit behind the low black wall there were
 faint and moving gleams of violet-of pale violet flames
 that changed and rose and fell vague tongues of violet
 fire wove themselves throughout that distant rose-colored
 mist with a writhing rhythmic motion they formed
 curious shapes of flame that faded strangely and came
 again

 but my description is futile the important thing
 was not what we saw but what we felt a curi-
 ously unpleasant sensation of helplessness and of


amazing stories

 strange horror came over me i felt as if i were steal-
 ing a forbidden glimpse of an ancient and incredible
 hell fear swept over me-alien inconceivable terror-
 like a keen and bitter wind that numbed my brain i
 felt the horror of a sentient force utterly inhuman
 devoid of all human knowledge or understanding as cold
 and remote as the frozen night of space

  it was terrible-an intangible aura of fear that
reached out of that pit and tugged at our souls with the
icy hand of stark horror i can give the world no con-
ception of the overwhelming terror of it  nor would
i if i could for such things are better forgotten i
dropped my rifle and clenched my hands trembling i
braced my feet as though against the force of a physical
wind that was striving to carry me toward that abyss
of nebulous horror-light

   i looked at sam he stood very still leaning back
 with hands raised and jaw dropped in his eyes was
 the look of the fresh and innocent soul that struggles
 with a pitiless terror that it cannot know or understand
 such a look i had never seen before-and god grant
 that i may never see it again

   my gaze was drawn irresistibly back into that mantle
 of moving light even as i watched a pillar of green
 flame very bright and broad thrust itself up through
 the wavering mist of violet fire and into the crimson
 haze it was like the slender head of some obscene green
 reptile it reached up--incredibly it writhed and
 twisted about it was like a great serpent of fire and
 it saw us

   it grew still with awful attention eternities seemed
 to pass as the dreadful thing hung there motionless like
 a vast frozen pillar of twisted emerald flame like a
 column of curdled green fire with curious throbbing
 changes in its brightness i felt a weird force flowing
 out of it and i knew that it was watching us

  my god sam muttered my god i looked at
him again his thin face was very white and beaded
with perspiration he was mechanically mopping at his
forehead with the red handkerchief and staring at the
mist of flame with the glaze of terror upon his eyes

   i struggled mightily to throw off the spell of amaze-
 ment and terror-of alien and unutterable horror-that
 was grasping at my mind it was a heart-breaking
 effort i moved i seized sams arm and shook it he
 swayed drunkenly with his eyes still on the awful lights
 he was like one in a trance-like a man in a dream of
 death

   and i felt those icy fingers of unthinkable doom clos-
 ing about my own mind i was paralyzed again with
 my eyes drawn back to the north the snakes head of
 frozen green still throbbed strangely and the flickering
 violet aurora still kept up its storm of varying motion
 in the dim rosy haze into which the awful head was
 lifted

 something was reaching toward us out of the pit
 i knew there was intelligence in it-a will inhuman and
 unthinkably strong it was calling us compelling us
 i knew that in a few moments we could fight no more

    suddenly a low sobbing sound reached us on that
   warm humid south wind a sound that wailed uncer-
   tainly behind us and rose to a piercing shriek and slowly
   died away into the distant south echoing weirdly on hills
   and trees as it rolled and sank

 sam started with a hoarse cry and went off down the
 hill toward the north at a stumbling run-toward that

 abyss of alien horror a moment more i struggled des-
 perately but that pitiless power overwhelmed me i
 followed in his tracks

   and then a clear rich voice reached me from beyond
 the hill-a shout in xenoras rich and ringing tones it
 had a clear human overtone of confidence and courage
 come back melvin dane come back sam

   the old scientist stopped uncertainly passing his hand
 dazedly before his brow abruptly the terror was gone
 from my mind the love and the courage of the brave
 girl flowed into me and suddenly with the green light
 still pulsing through it as though sent by a mighty heart
 the terrible thing in the north dimmed slowly and faded
 away still the violet lances flickered through the rosy
 mist but the green thing was gone-and we were free

   i took sams hand and we turned our backs on the
 amazing play of fire above the incredible pit and
 hastened to the trees from which xenoras voice had
 seemed to come we reached the little grove but i did
 not see the girl suddenly i had the persuasion that i
 had not actually heard her with my ears after all

  xenora xenora are you here i called un-
certainly

   sam was still trembling and mopping at his forehead
 she wasnt really here i think mel lie presently said
 in a strained voice she must have reached us with
 telepathy

   for a long time then we stood there under the flower-
 ing trees-very close together feeling all the awftil mys-
 tery of the strange world about us-and thinking of
 what had happened

   what was it my silent lips at last formed the
 question

    the lord of flame xenora said the lord of
 flame a serpent of green fire that dwells in xath
 below mutron  sam repeated mechanically i would
 to god i knew what it is

  and what was that awful sound

   that was the siren of die omnimobile i think you
 know we showed xenora how to operate it probably
 that saved us by attracting our minds from the thing
 while xenora reached us

  then if we go toward it-

   at the instant the wild sobbing shriek rose again very
 welcome for all the wailing qualities of its tones in
 a moment we were hastening down the green hillside
 among the purple trees in the direction from which the
 sound had come twice we heard it again and in
 half an hour we saw the glint of the silver metal side
 of the machine beyond a thicket of purple bloom

    i have seen few more welcome sights than the omni-
 mobile was then the heaviness of it the threatening
 nose of the little gun the air of irresistible power about
 it and even its clumsy beast-like appearance were reas-
 suring sam gave a cheer and we made the last hun-
 dred yards at a run at last we stumbled up the metal
 ladder and stood upon the narrow deck again

 we clambered through the manhole the white elec-
 tric light of the interior was in strange contrast to the
 crimson gloom and the coolness of the air was very
 refreshing xenora was in the cabin anxiously on her
 feet

    it was the lord of flame she whispered and
   you escaped

    thanks to you my dream girl i said taking her
   boldly in my arms
the green girl



chapter xx
sams pet

  i felt it watching you-calling you-and i pulled
  the cord that makes the great cry xenora whis-
  pered after a long long time

  thank god you did  it saved us we were lost 
and i told her of the amazing storm of flames of the
thing that had risen out of them and of the irresistible
spell of terror from which she had awakened us

  yes she said it was the lord of flame he
watches the world from xath he knows the acts of
every man

   i must have reeled a little with fatigue for suddenly
the girl looked at me with quick sympathy brimming in
her eyes but you-my white prince of dreams-you
are very tired you must rest

   abruptly i realized that i was tired dead with fatigue
with an unutterable weariness not only of body but of
mind for the horror had exhausted my emotions i
heard sam splashing water under the shower i fol-
lowed him to the bathroom and then went to my bunk
in the stern for i had given xenora my stateroom i
was leaden with weariness but peacefully secure in the
protection of the heavy metal walls of the omnimobile

   i have very little idea how long i slept for we had
let our watches run down in the absence of the sun
we came to pay less and less attention to the time though
we usually kept the chronometers going

  when i woke i felt greatly refreshed with my ter-
rorized despair almost gone but i would not forget
the sense of evil and intelligent power that i had got
from the pillar of strange green fire that had been thrust
so deliberately and purposefully up through the mist of
violet flame and into the rosy haze that hung over the
hidden abyss in which it lurked

  it had seen us i knew it and i knew that even
if its incredible power seemed withdrawn it was still
not far away

  i heard sam speak heard xenora laugh evidently
they were in the little galley for i heard the clatter of
cooking utensils i dressed and went in how beauti-
ful the girl was her red lips were brilliant against the
light green tan of her skin her dark hair fell over her
shoulders in a rich cascade and her violet eyes were
sparkling with life

  she came to me quickly and took my hand no
words passed between us for our minds were too near
together to need many words it was enough for me to
see the sympathy and love in her eyes and it seemed
again when our hands met that a subtle current flowed
back and forth between us setting our minds alight
making our hearts beat faster raising us together into
a higher ethereal plane and fusing our beings into one 

   in a moment sam with a kind smile of understanding
on his face called us to the table the steak from the
thing we had killed was a great success and the table
was loaded with the good things with which the larder
of the machine was stocked the girl ate heartily as
did sam and i and we talked and laughed a good deal
even if the small number of our common experiences
limited the topics of conversation we had a merry
enough time of it and somehow that happy meal gave
us greater courage to meet the strange menace that rose
before us

   after we had eaten and all had helped wash the
dishes all in the same gay spirit sam got out the box
in which he had put the little creature he had named
alexander i had quite forgotten all about the diminu-
tive winged plant with mingled curiosity and repul-
sion i watched him unfasten the box i had not yet
recovered from my instinctive horror at sight of the
flying plants xenora seemed to share my antipathy
toward them but sam has always seemed to care as
much for wild life as for men and he seemed to con-
sider the little creature as natural a pet as a dog how-
ever of course his real reason for keeping it was for
scientific observation

   the thing fluttered about in the box when he picked
it up and as soon as the lid was raised it flew out and
lit on his hand already it seemed bigger and stronger
than it had been a day before the pale yellow of the
little fish-like body was darkening the wings seemed
a darker green and stronger the blood-color of the
slender tentacles along the sides of the body was growing
deeper and deeper

   the weird little monster clung to his finger with
three of its tentacles holding the thin petal-like mem-
branes about its head extended and moving its black
knobbed organs restlessly at first the color of the
flower-like tissues was almost white but when i made
a sudden motion they quickly darkened to a deep violet
and the little creature crouched down in sams hand as
if it were alarmed

   sam smiled down at it with real understanding in his
face

   h uncovered on the table a dish containing a great
chunk of the raw bloody meat of the thing we had killed
the queer flower-like head twisted about and the black
stalked organs moved like eyes abruptly the membrane
changed color again from the violet of its fright to a
deep red

   sam held his hand over the meat and the slender ten-
tacles disengaged themselves and writhed down over the
plate like tiny red snakes they began to suck the juices
out of the meat and as the thing filled itself the strange
flower slowly faded in color until it was a pale pink

   observing my instinctive horror of the thing sam
said thats the way it was meant to eat mel noth-
ing unnatural about it our table manners might not
seem very elegant to an angel 

   i guess youre right but that thing just gets on
my nerves

   when he went to put the little creature back in the
box it clung to his finger as if reluctant to go and
strange bright patterns of color flashed over the thin
membrane it seems fantastic enough but even then i
was sure that the little thing possessed intelligence and
that it was beginning to feel affection for sam

   the next time he took it out it seemed larger and
stronger-and hungrier we stayed there for what
must have been ten days though we kept no accurate
account of time it grew rather astonishingly and
always its odd appearance of intelligence was greater
it seemed to feel a real affection for sam he whistled
ancient tunes to it sometimes and it seemed to listen
in great delight and for long hours he would sit with
the thing in his lap and talk to it he declared that it
was getting so that it could understand bright colors
crawled on the membranous fringe and it seemed to
listen to him with great intentness

                                                                       r

back to the haunted hill

on the morning-if one may speak of morning
in that world of eternal day-after we had slept
off the fatigue of our visit to the hill where we
had seen the lights of terror sam took me aside for a
short talk

  mel he said we cant forget what weve come here
for my generator is still keeping up the interference
in the ether but sooner or later the force we have
come to fight-and it must be that lord of flame of
xenoras and the thing we saw from the hill-will
break down the interference and then the earth-will
freeze

  but what can we do against-that and xenora
sam i cant leave her shes worth more to me than
the earth theres plenty of room in here for us to
live our lives out ive been thinking about it-and i
cant go

  he nodded sympathetically i know mel she
means a lot to you but perhaps we will win and save
our lives too

  not a chance i said bitterly not against that
thing we saw it means death-or worse but i sup-
pose we have to go on and do our best

  the old man was beaming he patted me on the
shoulder i knew you would be with me when you had
time to think he said now when the life of the
world is at issue we cant consider ourselves

  what do you think we can do

  what cant we do we have the omnimobile we
have machines and tools we have knowledge and our
hands we can go anywhere and do anything but
the first thing is to study to find out what we have to
deal with and how to fight it

  i suppose so

  mel we must go back to that hill

  no no not there it was only a miracle-and
xenora-that saved us before

  ive some theories well be better prepared next
time

  a sudden thought struck me say couldnt we pay
a flying visit to our own world again and tell what
weve found  then the world would still have a chance
when we are-gone a half-million americans with
tanks and heavy artillery would look mighty good down
here and it would just take a day or two to go
no sam said the world would hardly believe
it all even if we carried out what evidence we could
and nothing could be done in time then im not sure
we could get out in fact im pretty sure we couldnt
the rockets might carry us three miles high all right
but we could never break through that water from be-
neath we would fall back mel its up to us
during the days that followed sam spent most of his
hours in the little laboratory he spent much time on
those great machines that controlled his forces in the
ether and he invented and developed another device
that was more nearly within my understanding

  you know mel he said one day i think i can
rig up something to protect us from that-fear-that
came so near getting us ever since you made your
telepathic contact with the green girl i have had the
idea that the brain sets up disturbances in the ether

we know that the action of the nervous system is elec-
trical in nature and all electric discharges set up ether
waves it happened that you and she had great minds
created in perfect synchronism so that each was sensi-
tive to the vibrations of the other hypnotism is best
explained by such electric theories

  now i am convinced that the lord of flame
is a brain-whether in a human body or not i cannot
attempt to say it creates such powerful etheric dis-
turbances that it was able to affect us at a distance if
that is the case it ought to be a fairly simple matter to
provide insulation against its vibrations you know that
induction or electric action cannot penetrate a conduct-
ing cage i ought to be able to fix a conducting helmet
that will prevent the induction of neuronic currents in
our brains

  a short time after he showed me three helmets as he
called them they were little more than bags of wire
gauze to be put over our heads he demonstrated that an
electroscope draped with one of them remained entirely
unaffected by charges brought near it but it seemed a
ridiculously inadequate protection against that terror

  we went hunting several times for the benefit of the
little plant after the first few days sam let it go
along hanging on his coat it was growing very fast and
developing remarkable characteristics it showed sur-
prising intelligence sam seemed to have a real affec-
tion for it and it in turn seemed to love him

   i never ceased to feel the strangeness of those expedi-
tions over the rolling green grasslands among the
sparsely scattered flowering trees in the hot damp air
and the intense red light we shot two more animals
like the first and three others of a smaller variety which
somewhat resembled large rabbits

  very shortly after sam had perfected his electro-
screen helmets he planned another expedition to the hill
where we had so nearly met incredible disaster we
carried a telescope electrometers spectroscope and a
few pieces of sams recently developed and highly com-
plicated apparatus which he had neglected to name for
detecting and analyzing etheric waves

  xenora insisted on going with us and there seemed
no reason for leaving her behind since sam had perfect
confidence in the efficacy of his new helmets and since
the girl herself was an excellent woodsman and could
undertake to keep us from getting lost

  we had a long hot march of it across the green plateau
among the purple trees with the fierce beams of the
crimson sky pouring down upon us burdened with the
heavy instruments we were worn out when we reached
the summit i had suggested that we come in the ma-
chine but sam wanted to keep it out of the sight of
the weird enemy we fought

  once more we gazed across the vast valley of purple
and green to the mists of ruby light over that abyss be-
yond the distant lake in which the violet beams still
danced and pulsed and hardly did we have our ap-
paratus set up when we saw that unearthly serpent-
like beam of green fire writhe up out of the vale of
mystery into the rosy haze

  we had on the insulating shields and i felt nothing
of the inexplicable horror of the former occasion
though of course the whole adventure was certainly
terrible enough but now that strange thing of green
seemed distant and devoid of menace by way of ex-
periment i ventured to raise my helmet the terror
the green girl



caught me like a cold and rushing torrent that swept me
almost off my feet  i was glad enough to get the wire
gauze fastened back about my head again

   it is the lord of flame xenora cried looking
 over toward the city of my people to see who will be
 taken to become his slaves this is a wonderful thing
 barsoni sam that lets us not feel its power-barsoni
 being a word that means great man in the tongue of
 lothar

   for many minutes the amazing shape of twisting
green radiance hung in the air sam was busy with his
apparatus squinting at the thing through telescope and
spectroscopc and reading his other devices at last the
awful throbbing thing faded away and died into noth-
ingness only the violet lances were left in the mist

   many of my theories were substantiated sam in-
 formed me almost jubilant and i got a lot of new
 data it is rather odd but the light from that thing
 shows the helium lines as luminous bands not as the
 dark lines that might be expected to rise from the ab-
 sorption of the helium in this atmosphere i can hardly
 understand it

   he said nothing more but was sunk deep in thought
 as we quickly gathered the instruments and hastened
 silently down the hill i felt that he had won a notable
 victory in the invention of the thought-insulating hel-
 mets we arrived at the machine again without
 accident

chapter xxii

the silver sphere

for several days longer sam continued his labors
in the laboratory during that time alexander
the flying plant developed remarkably before we
moved it had a wing-spread of two or three feet i
have spoken of its intelligence it soon learned to flutter
to the guns when we were preparing to hunt sam
talked to it incessantly and declared that it could un-
derstand him he said it could even make its thoughts
known by the varying pattern of colors on its fringe
of brilliant membrane presently he had it trained to
dry dishes and to do other similar tasks in the galley

   of course the thing never learned to speak in fact
 it was devoid of vocal organs and incapable of making
 a sound though its hearing seemed to be good enough
 it appeared to communicate its emotions and thoughts
 by means of changes of color in the tissue-like mem-
 brane that i have termed a flower and from a strictly
 scientific point of view communication by light or sight
 is quite as logical as communication by sound

   sam examined the black rod-like organs projecting
 from the flower on the thing and said that each of them
 bore thousands of tiny eyes like the compound eyes of
 an insect

   after we had been in the vicinity for perhaps two
 weeks by upper world time we started the omnimo-
 biles great motors again and moved northward i had
 not told xenora about my talk with sam-our minds
 were too closely attuned to require much conversation

 i knew that she understood that our maneuver would
 probably mean our sacrifice to the cause of the world
 she said nothing of it but i thought i detected a sadness
 in her manner

during all the hours that sam had been in his labora-

tory alone or with alexander i had spent most of the
time with xenora we wandered together about the
meadows or sat in the cabin to escape the almost intol-
erable heat always i loved her more brimming as she
was with humor and sympathy and love and bitterly
i cursed the fate that was dragging us both to our
doom

   even at the beginning sams scientific achievements
 had been so far above my understanding that i would
 scarcely comprehend them and his later speculations
 regarding the menace of the abyss were so abstruse that
 i quite failed to follow them his little workshop for-
 ward was crammed with strange machinery- some of it
 humming incessantly indeed his apparatus was still
 keeping up the interference that prevented the freezing
 of the earth

   sam had been signally unsuccessful in getting any
 scientific information from xenora for the simple
 reason that she had none to impart but from her
 geographical knowledge he attempted to draw a map
 showing the locations of lothar of mutron and of the
 pit of the lord of flame

   it seemed that there was a strip a score of miles in
 width between the farther blue walls of the abyss and
 the great lake we had seen the pit of xath seemed to
 be a great crater lying in that strip on the brink of the
 crater xenora located her city of the sleepers or
 mutron the domain of the last city of lothar where
 she had spent her childhood lay along the cliffs far to
 the west of there

   our boldest plan of action would have been to hurl
 the machine by means of the rocket tubes into the abyss
 in a direct attack on the lord of flame but sam for
 reasons he did not divulge doubted the success of such
 a maneuver he wished to keep up his researches and
 possibly to visit the city of lothar his apparatus told
 him that hidden forces were again stirring in the ether

   for ten hours we moved toward the north making a
 long detour to westward to keep within a valley and
 always trying to take advantage of such cover as was
 offered by the purple trees the country was for the
 most part rolling and green with the great flowering
 trees dotting the hills and plains but sparsely the
 blazing radiation of the eternal crimson day was un-
 diminished but the temperature fell slightly with in-
 creased altitude

   xenora and i were together at the cabin control-board
 driving the machine and sam was in the conning-
 tower with the little gun ready for emergencies when
 we had been moving for some ten hours we mounted a
 low bare hill and saw in the little green valley before
 us a thicker forest of the bright purple trees offering
 good cover for the machine

   we had crossed the summit and i had increased the
 speed to ten miles per hour in haste to reach the trees
 in spite of sams fear that the operation of the motors
 at anything like full capacity would create a disturbance
 in the ether that our hidden enemies would pick up

   suddenly i saw a strange thing skimming along over
 the bright forest before us-in our direction it looked
 like a bright silver globe many feet in diameter it
 floated a few hundred feet above the trees drifting
 smoothly along like a bright metal balloon in a very swift
 wind there was no visible propulsive mechanism

  i shouted a warning to sam through the speaking
tube to stand by his little gun
-

amazing stories

   xenora laid a light hand on my shoulder and said
 in a tense voice it is the sleepers of mutron the slaves
 of the lord of flame they will fight to death-they
 know not fear

   as the silver sphere drifted swiftly and silently down
 upon us as though borne by an invisible wind twice i
 caught a glimpse of a slender ray of purple flame that
 darted out of it and moved searchingly over the bare
 greensward below and then a rich purple beam fell
 suddenly and intensely upon the omnimobile

   when that misty finger of purple light discovered us

 i saw a strange vortex of pale green fire spring up about
 the globe and reach out in our direction suddenly i
 realized that this ship was of the same appearance as the
 weird thing that had destroyed our cottage small hope

 i thought if that force of atomic disintegration were
 to be released again

   i heard the rapid crashing of the machine gun as sam
 began to fire and presently bursts of smoke appeared
 about the gleaming sphere but to hit a relatively small
 and rapidly moving target even a mile away is no mean
 feat of marksmanship i drove rapidly for the purple
 wood but with little hope of getting there before the
 terrible red disintegration had melted us away

   suddenly i heard the drone of some of sams new
 machinery going into action he had mounted his
 switches and dials in the conning-tower so he could
 control it from where he stood vivid blue electric flame
 quivered and flashed over the metal parts of the machine
 as his new weapons went into play

   the floating globe of silver drifted nearer and the
 misty vortex of green fire about us grew more intense
 a strange red glow stole over the vegetation around us
 and a solitary purple tree ahead burst into crimson flame
 then the sparkling fingers of purple fire reached out at
 us again from the sphere i wondered vaguely why the
 strange force was not acting upon us i did not know
 until it was all over that sams vacuum tubes had set
 up a repulsive screen in the ether protecting us from
 the electronic vortex

   abruptly an intensely bright blinding tongue of white
 flame leapt toward the silver thing from the great plat-
 inum electrode on the nose of the omnimobile sam
 had turned loose his electric arc the flame struck the
 globe impinging upon it like a jet of fire converting it
 into a ball of supernal light

   then it fell it plunged toward the forest in a gleam-
 ing curve the green vortex of the disintegrator ray
 was gone and the purple fingers shone no longer the
 incandescent shell crashed out of sight beyond the purple
 trees

chapter xxiii

the green slaves

 sam snapped off the arc as the silver ship fell and
 the drumming of the generators stopped for a
 little time the world was very still xenora stood
 tense and silent beside me as i turned toward her i
 caught the slight perfume of her dark hair

   indeed the green girl was a beautiful being the
 white flannels she wore failed to conceal the delectable
 curves of her slight and boyish figure her rich red
 lips were parted slightly in the unconscious intensity of
 her outward gaze

   abruptly she became conscious of my look and turned
 to face me with a quick smile on her face there was
 a radiant joyous light in her eyes the soft green tint
 of her skin was obscured by the rich warm flush of her
 excitement and she smiled with gladness

   impulsively she reached her slender hand out to take
 mine you have won melvin dane her soft voice
 said the ship of mutron is fallen we shall not
 be slaves of the lord of flame we shall not die the
 violet death in the pit of xath

  i hope not my xenora i said i hope- and

 i stopped in a little confusion i was not really em-
 barrassed but i could not go on really talking to a
 princess like xenora is quite a different tiling from mak-
 ing protestations of love to a being of ones dreams

   what is it that you hope she said quickly with an
 impish smile

   sam saved me by coming in from the turret begrimed
 with the smoke of the little cannon he was a won-
 derful man he was still strong erect and confident
 despite the load of toil and hardship our adventure was
 putting upon his seventy years his white hair was
 tousled and he was cheerfully loading up his ancient
 pipe as calmly as if he were in his own kitchen in
 florida

   looks like the arc did for em all right he said
 briskly suppose we get over and take a look we
 might pick up something new

   very well i assented and turned to start the mo-
 tors i could not resist a grin at xenora who was still
 regarding me with a speculative smile she laughed
 back at me then was suddenly serious

   be careful the sleepers of mutron they might
 be alive in the wreck as long as they breathe the lord
 of flame rules them

   i started the generators and the omnimobile rolled
 heavily down across the green slope and through the
 fringe of flaming purple trees in a few minutes we
 came upon the wreck of the silver car a great tangle
 of twisted wreckage half fused by the electricity and
 bent and torn by the fall it lay in the little open space
 with a great tree splintered and smoking under it and
 the ground about empurpled with fallen petals the
 twisted metal plates gleamed brightly in the light of the
 scarlet sky

   i stopped the omnimobile and we got out and ap-
 proached the wrecked machine there was a vast mass
 of the debris the globe must have been forty feet in
 diameter we spent several minutes in gazing at it from
 different angles and then am and i climbed into the
 tangle of bent white plates and massive twisted girders

   the machinery had been too completely destroyed for
 us to be sure just how it worked but sam thought
 that the shell had carried tanks of water the gravity of
 which had been negatived by the emanations from tanks
 of the same luminous gas which supported the roof of
 waters lifting the ship from the nature of the frag-
 ments of electrical machinery we observed it seemed
 that the horizontal propulsion was attained by the ion-
 ization and repulsion of the helium atoms in the air
 the apparatus that had produced the atomic disintegra-
 tion was too badly wrecked to be identified

 presently i came upon the body of a man caught
 between two twisted bars and cut half in two the
 body was naked it had a greenish cast that was darker
 by far than that of xenoras fair skin the physique
the green girl



and the size and shape of the head showed a race of
high intellectual development

  the dead man had a metal frame clamped upon his
back it was twisted and broken and whatever had
been fastened upon his body had been torn away in
the crash and the corpse had upon its back the strange
violet stains that had been upon xenora when we found
her 

  presently sam found another body it had been half
burned up by the arc it too had the metal frame upon
it and the thing the frame was to hold was still clamped
to it the body bore fastened to the back with those
cruel metal clamps a six-sided bar of blue metal it
was six inches in diameter and two feet long

   this must be the thing xenora calls a fire crystal 
sam said though i dont see any fire about it its
damned queer

   do you suppose there is machinery in the bar that
generates forces or currents that move the man about
like a puppet

  might be i dont know the metal thing may be
a receiver for the occult force set up in the ether by the
lord of flame-hypnotism by radio perhaps or some-
thing of the kind

   anyhow as you said its damned queer like every-
thing else weve found here-excepting xenora
suppose we take the thing along and open it up
when we have time

   he produced a pair of pliers and we twisted the odd
blue bar out of its frame and carried it to the machine
it was oddly light to be metal though it must have been
an irksome burden to the one on which it was fastened
we got aboard again and moved for the cover of the
purple wood for we did not know how soon relief would
come for the fallen ship but xenora assured us that
the lunaks as she called the flying things quite fre-
quently destroyed the ships of mutron and that the fate
of this one would be laid to them

chapter xxiv

the blue prism

for perhaps thirty miles we drove the great ma-
chine through the brilliant forest southward down
a broad valley at last we stopped in a little grove
of tall flowering trees close by the cool crystal stream
beyond the grove was a little patch of green clearing
with the great purple trees closing in all about it it
was a peaceful spot weirdly beautiful and it seemed
secure enough the unceasing wind was not so hot be-
neath the great trees and they shielded us from the burn-
ing crimson glare of the sky

  the omnimobile seemed safely hidden beneath the
masses of purple bloom and whenever we were tired
or thought ourselves in danger we could retire to the
quiet security of its cool interior behind the thick metal
walls frankly i hoped that our stay there would be
a long one i tried to forget the menace that hung over
the earth

  our life there was simple and for my part i was
supremely happy or not quite supremely for i could
not quite still my conscience i was pretty well resigned
to fate however with such a girl as xenora a man
might be supremely happy anywhere we tramped to-
gether about the grove gathered the tiny bright-red

flowers in the green meadows and bathed in the cool
dark pools where the river flowed beneath the purple
trees sometimes she sang to me the folk-songs of her
people monuments of the high estate that lothar had
once enjoyed

  what would it matter to me if the eternal death came
again and forever to the upper earth what would it
matter if the earth did freeze i forgot in the idyllic
happiness of xenoras companionship-or tried to for-
get if the roof of water were changed to ice it would
only be more secure the maiden and i could live out
our lives in this strange land without regard to the fate
of the world one of her matchless smiles or a note
of her golden laughter was worth more than all the
earth

  meanwhile sam was immersed in his laboratory work
in the examination of the prism of blue metal and in
his curious pet the plant creature still grew with re-
markable speed and always showed most remarkable
intelligence it was always with sam flapping along
above him on broad green wings or walking awkwardly
upon its thickening red tentacles sam gazed at the
flickering colors of the membranes about the head with
the light of strange understanding in his eyes making
strange gestures with his hands just to what extent
they could communicate i never knew

  it always went with him when he went to hunt for its
meat it was a voracious eater requiring a kill a day
the great sloth-like animals were plentiful and sluggish
it was not difficult to stalk them as soon as it was
strong enough the plant creature learned to carry sams
rifle its extraordinary intelligence or imitative instinct
is shown by the fact that one day it fired the gun itself
when it was flying with the weapon and saw one of the
sloths on the run

  it showed a very real affection for sam once when
they were out together it saved his life one of the
tuskers had suddenly charged him from behind and the
creature flew at it and attacked it madly with its un-
developed claws at the cost of considerable minor
injury to itself it held the beast off until sam could get
in a shot it always showed an odd delight at his ca-
resses and seemed to take a peculiar joy in the music
of his old phonograph

  as i have said it grew very quickly at the time
we stopped in the wood it was somewhat smaller than
a hawk perhaps two months later time was rather
meaningless to us during that one happy period of our
adventures in that world of unending day the creature
had grown so large that once in an apparently playful
mood it was able to lift sam and fly with him on a cir-
cuit of a hundred yards bringing him back to the ma-
chine and setting him down very softly then its
armored brown body was as large as a man and the
green wings were like sails

  that was near the end

  during all that period sam devoted much time to the
examination of that bar of strangely light bright blue
metal he felt that in it he might find a solution to
the mystery of the lord of flame i assisted him as
much as i could the metal was evidently an alloy
analysis showed that it consisted largely of aluminum
there was a trace of a heavy metal that we could not
identify and the bar was slightly very slightly radio-
active-perhaps sam thought merely because it had
been exposed to intense radium emanations


amazing stories

   the density of the bar was only half that of alumi-
num for some time we could not understand that
careful examination showed no break in the surface
and presently we sawed it in two and then in many
pieces searching for the machinery that we half-
expected to find but as far as we could determine the
bar was absolutely homogeneous

  then sam thought of examining it under the micro-
scope he found that it was full of microscopic bub-
bles-hollow places by later experiment we found
that the metal was just a sponge of the strange alloy
filled with tiny bubbles of helium gas under considerable
pressure sam presently formulated the theory that the
alloy when formed had contained considerable amounts
of radium compounds and that the alpha particles or
charged helium atoms thrown off by the disintegration
of the radium while the metal was in a semi-plastic
state had been imprisoned in it

  but it was not until later-much later-that we got
the true meaning of it-that we understood the in-
sidious force that acted in the metal to make human
beings slaves to it

  so the days went by-happy carefree days for me

i knew real joy for the first time in my life since
youth i had known the green girl in my fancy i had
longed to find her with a restless hopeless longing that
had left me discontented and unhappy whatever my sur-
roundings now at last she was really mine i loved
her with a singleness and intensity of affection that
turned all my emotion in one direction so i felt little
fear or care for anything else

   one day when we sat like children together on a cool
moss-covered rock beneath a great fragrant purple tree
with a crystal pool before us gleaming like molten ruby
in the light of the scarlet sky i told her quite simply
that i loved her-that i had known her always and
loved her as long

  the white chieftain of my dreams she whispered
for what long years i have wished for you to come and
tell me that

  there was no need for further words between us it
was a long long time before we returned to the machine
and then i am afraid we both flushed a little before the
smile of tender understanding on sams lean face

chapter xxv

the tragedy in the purple wood

our woodland life was happy we were quite
unconscious of the events that were shaping
themselves to bring sudden catastrophe we
saw in our simple lives no foreshadowing of the supreme
moments of the stupendous drama in which we were in-
volved the crisis came with little enough warning

  on the last day of our joyous existence there we
had fallen into the habit of making an arbitrary division
of our time into days and nights sam arose and fixed
our breakfast i remember that we had pancakes with
maple sirup then since alexander was fluttering
about eager for the days hunt and flickering messages
to him with its petal-like membrane he got his rifle and
they departed

  as the old scientist walked off through the purple
trees puffing steadily on the old pipe in his mouth
fondly watching the huge winged beast that flew along

above him with his gun little did i dream of the tragedy
that was in store i could not have believed that sam
stood in any great danger the winged creature that
attended him was two-thirds grown it would have been
more than a match for a couple of lions  certainly it
was no feeble bodyguard

  an hour after he had gone xenora and i took one of
my old romances of science and walked a quarter of a
mile up the limpid stream to a favorite resort of ours
we laughed and talked much by the way and gathered a
great bunch of the little red blooms i was teaching her
to read-at least that was our nominal business though
it was usually forgotten

  the living wonderful mystery of her her sheer per-
fection the life and love that sparkled in her eyes all
enchanted me carried my thoughts away from the page

  we sat together on our mossy stone seat reading a
little and laughing and talking much until we forgot all
except each other when i looked at my watch i found
that we had been there many hours we got up and
started back to the machine speculating light-heartedly
on what sam would have ready for dinner

  we shouted carefree greetings as we approached the
machine and received no reply we got to the deck and
descended to the cabin in vague alarm but saw no sign
of the old scientist we hoped that he had only been
delayed i blew the siren several times and listened to
hear a signal from his gun but when the echoes of the
blast had died away from the silent purple wood all was
still again we heard no answering shot

  i climbed out on the deck to listen not a sound dis-
turbed the stillness save the faint rustle of the unceasing
wind in the purple trees above and the crystal tinkle of
the little stream green meadows and bright trees lay
steaming beneath the hot red sky-quiet as death the
stillness was ominous it bore the portent of doom

  presently xenora crept up by me and ran her strong
cool arm through mine her violet eyes were solemn
now and her fair face was clouded with anxiety she
had come to share my love for sam

  i am afraid for him she whispered many things
might have happened the beasts he hunted may have
charged and killed him or a ship of mutron may have
found him-the ships of the lord of flame travel even
to the waters of the lower sea to do battle with the
lunaks and there is another danger of the wood-that
is never seen the hunters of lothar never venture far
from the city

  her words were not particularly encouraging and i
made ready to go to look for sam at once i carried a heavy
rifle my pistol and an emergency medicine kit xenora
insisted on going along and i could do nothing but assent
i did not wish to leave her alone and she herself was no
mean woodsman in fact when it came to the matter of
following the trail over the low green plants she proved
far more expert than myself

  we left at once the trail led us east for a mile par-
allel to the stream in the cover of the purple trees then
it turned north across an open meadow and there
xenora picked up the spoor of one of the great sloths
which sam had stalked it led on to a group of three
giant purple trees and there we found two fired catridges
from sams rifle three hundred yards farther on in an
open meadow we found the kill

  alexander had evidently had his fill from it and near
by were the dying embers of a fire and the charred green
the green girl



stick on which sam had cooked a steak for himself the
ground around the fire was somewhat tom up the
green plants had been uprooted and crushed and there
on the ground i found another cartridge from the rifle

   presently xenora picked up a trail leading toward a
 clump of the flowering trees to the north we followed
 it hastily silent with fearful anticipations twice we
 saw on the ground great splashes of green liquid of the
 life-fluid of the plant creatures had sams pet been
 fighting for him in the air as he fled 

   then we came to the pitiful end of the trail the
 ground was frightfully torn up as if great bodies had
 struggled there there were great splotches of the green
 fluid and a fateful stain-evidently of human blood
 sams battered pith helmet we found on the ground there
 and six fired shells-silent tokens of the battle

   from the spot no trail led away there was no evi-
 dence to show whether the battle had ended in death or
 in capture nor anything to show what manner of being
 the unknown assailant had been for a long time we
 stood there gazing at the spot in lifeless grief and de-
 spair apathetically fingering the helmet and shells vainly
 trying to picture the contest and looking about for other
 signs

   it is no use to go farther xenora said at last it
 is the unknown menace of the purple wood many a man
 of lothar has been taken by it-it is a silent wineed
 death	k

chapter xxvi

the last city of lothar

 presently we turned and trudged wearily back
 to the omnimobile there was nothing else to do

 i was sick with an aching heart it was incredible
 that sam kind and true friend that he had always been
 should be no more a choking lump rose in my throat
 and i confess that a few tears rolled down my cheek

   but i still had xenora as we walked i put my arms
 around her protectingly in the grim determination that
 this strange world should not rob me also of the dream
 girl for whom i had searched two worlds my love of
 her kept me from utter despair but even then i knew
 that our ideal life could not go on

   i would have to find what it was that had taken sam-
 to identify the thing that xenora called so vaguely the
 menace of the purple wood might it be the wild plant
 monsters or was it something even more alien and ter-
 rible and i thought more seriously of the danger to
 the earth that i had been trying so vainly to forget
 sams responsibility had fallen on my shoulders i must
 see what i could do

   with the wonderful intuitive knowledge of one an-
 other s thoughts that xenora and i have always had she
 understood what was passing in my mind before i said
 anything softly she took my fingers in her hand and
 looked at me with deep sympathy in her eyes

   i know melvin what you think and it is right it
 is hard so soon after you have come here to find me-
 but it must be i can guide you to the city pf my people

 i can even show you to the brink of the pit of xath
 if you would go there

   you are very brave and true my princess

   i come from lothar if you feel that your duty bids
 you risk the violet death in xath i would not dissuade

 you but the lord of flame is mighty-no man can
 fight him he has power over all

   except our love i said i stopped and took her in
 my arms and pressed her red warm lips against my own
 in the whole world she was all that was mine she clung
 to me fiercely as if the terrible power of the pit of flames
 was trying to tear her away

   at last we went on and presently we reached the omni-
 mobile hidden in the purple grove in sams absence it
 looked very cheerless and lonely we got aboard and made
 ready for departure i tuned up the motors and exam-
 ined the electric weapons and cleaned and loaded the
 little cannon again as i worked xenora went in the
 galley and fixed a lunch we ate quickly under the
 silent pall of bitter tragedy thinking of the smiling old
 man that should have been with us

   then we climbed into the conning-tower and i
switched on the engines the humming of the genera-
tors rose again and the great machine lumbered clumsily
out of the little wood where it had been hidden for so
many happy days for many hours we held a north-
westward course over the green plateaus and through the
purple woodlands with the light of the crimson day shin-
ing through the ports

   xenora stood by me and chose the route for the last
 few miles we crept along just east of a high bare ridge
 of rocks at last she bade me stop the machine in a
 clump of trees at the foot of the hill the last city of
 lothar she said lay but a mile beyond

   i took my binoculars and a rifle and we left the ma-
 chine and clambered up a half mile to the top of the
 ridge the girl led the way slipping cautiously through
 the rocks at last she threw herself down behind a
 fringe of the low green plants and motioned me to crawl
 up beside her

   look she whispered and see all that is left of
 lothar the proud kingdom of my fathers under the
 curse of the lord of flame

   indeed it was a scene of ruined grandeur that met my
 eyes a little valley perhaps two miles wide lay beyond
 the ridge on which we were concealed on the low hill
 beyond standing out against the crimson sky was a mas-
 sive ruined wall back of it rose the crumbling desolate
 ruins of great towers and palaces of stone covered with
 the moss of centuries of decay-merely the bare bleached
 skull of a dead civilization

   it was in those fallen palaces of my fathers xenora
 whispered again that i found the strange machine that
 brought me the first dream of you

  i put up the glasses and made out the actual city out-
 side the wall certainly lothar had fallen since its days
 of radio there was a mere straggling village of rude
 stone huts spread out on the valley floor below the colos-
 sal ruined metropolis the few hundred buildings were
 surrounded by a little cleared space with the purple for-
 est creeping up to reclaim it forever i made out a few
 children playing about the trees and a dozen ill-clad men
 working in the clearings a few wreaths of smoke
 curled up from the dwellings the peole had not yet lost
 the art of fire

   and hanging silent and menacing in the air above the
 village was the visible symbol of the alien power that had
 wrecked that ancient civilization a great gleaming
 silver ball-a ship like the one we had fought-hung mo-
 tionless above the huts with a quick purple beam from it
 flickering frequently over them


amazing stories

  for a long time we lay there watching that desolate
pitiful scene and then xenora touched my arms and we
slipped back down the ridge she was silent with grief
and despair in her eyes

  see she whispered at last see lothar is dead
the lord of flame has killed it the men are poor
struggling wretches they could do nothing even if the
flame were gone my father was the last king of lo-
thar his was a troubled reign and he has been dead
many hundred sleeps

  dont grieve so my princess i said there are
still vast cities above the waters where men are power-
ful and wise and where the sky is blue and a white sun
shines and where there is a domain many times larger
than all this abyss

  can we go there-ever  she questioned eagerly

  no we can never leave this land even if the lord
of flame is killed the machine cannot break through
the roof of water from below and the power of the
lord of flame is coming to earth even now it may be
a dead and frozen world

  and drooping in the silence of dull despair we reached
the machine and drove quickly for the protection of the
deeper wood

chapter xxvii

mutron of the sleepers

for half a dozen hours we lumbered eastward
through the forest we wallowed through swamps
and rolled over broad green meadows alight with
the crimson day and broke through jungles bright with
purple bloom at last we emerged on a narrow upland
with the great lake below it the black sheet of water
tinged with the red light of the sky stretched away for
many miles to the eastward along its northern shore we
could see the low cliffs that divided it from the pit of
xath

  we stopped the machine and looked for a long time
across the black lake to the north and over the low cliffs
to the ruby mist beyond alive with the dancing violet
lights

  then i turned to the rare girl beside me who was
watching me with tears brimming in her violet eyes the
utter grief the black despair  her face half broke my
resolution i felt doubtful weak utterly miserable with
pain stabbing at my heart like a thin steel blade

  it is right you must go she whispered bravely

  i took her in my arms again how wonderful and true
she was struggling so bravely to hold back her tears
more precious than ever in the final parting a single
hour of the heaven of that embrace-embittered by the
knowledge that it would soon be ended

  then quickly lest my resolution fail i made ready for
departure i stretched up a tent in a little grove above
the lake and stocked it with a liberal assortment of sup-
plies from our store-room i gave xenora an automatic
and a case of ammunition and showed her how to use the
weapon here she was to stay in the vain hope that i
might return a victor from the mad attack on the lord
of flame

  for i had determined to enter the abyss i knew that
was what sam would have me do rather than lose time
in an attempt to learn his fate xenora was eager to cast
her lot with mine but i would not hear of it

  a choking lump was in my throat as i staggered

aboard the omnimobile and closed the manhole with a
trembling hand i gave a final heartbreaking glance to
the splendid girl majestic and erect even in her pain
standing desolate and alone by the tent then i turned
on the generators and drove north along the lake shore

  i had the rude map that sam had drawn from xen-
oras knowledge it showed the pit of the lord of flame
to be just north of the lake separated from it only by a
surprisingly narrow wall of cliffs which the girl said
had been a highway of her fathers though it was now
covered with jungle and the city of mutron was shown
north of me  the brink of the pit of xath

  steadily i drove northward in a daze of fevered pain
it seems an eternity when i look back upon it but it could
not have been many hours automatically i kept in the
shelter of the purple trees at last i emerged on the
edge of a great plateau covered with the green vegeta-
tion many miles across on the south and west from
whence i had come it was surrounded by purple trees-
by the thick purple wood in which i had halted on the
north the great cliffs towered up to the sharp-edged scar-
let roof four miles above it was strange to see the blue
walls cut off so abruptly by the red the sky was like a
red lake seen inverted in a mirror those blue cliffs
were hardly a dozen miles away now-i had to bend back
my head to see the sharp line where the roof cut them
off

  on the east side of that plateau there was-nothing

  beyond lay the pit of xath with the faint ruby mist
above it filled as always with the wavering reflections of
violet flames and a half dozen miles before me on the
brink of that pit stood-mutron

  the city of the sleepers

  a strange scene it was a city of silver metal
domes and towers and pyramids of argent whiteness
vast incredible machines huge and oddly wrought
structures titanic cubes and cylinders and cones all
of gleaming silver the city shone with a cold light it
was as weird as unearthly as a dead city of the moon
it had the silent ghostly gleam of moonlight it was
wrapped in mystery clad in frozen fear

  and the city was not idle those vast amazing ma-
chines were moving silver globe-ships were drifting in
silent haste above it and ever and anon one of them
dropped over the rim into the pit of xath or one floated
unexpectedly up out of that abyss

  as i stood there in the omnimobile in the shadow of
the last of the purple trees my heart grew sick again
with doubt what indeed could i with my puny ma-
chine do against the great science that that city of mys-
tery represented the men of one once mighty empire
were now slaves to it what hope was there for me
was not the human race like the bison or the dodo about
to fall before a superior power 

  but there would be no turning back i saw to it that
all the machinery was in order and returned to the con-
ning-tower before me was the instrument board that
controlled the electric arc and the rocket tubes as well as
the machinery

  i started the hydrodyne generators at their full capac-
ity and then threw the switch as the half million horse
power went through the resistance coils jets of super-
heated steam roared out of the nozzles condensing in
white rushing clouds the terrific force of the jets up-
rooted the purple trees and the machine vibrated to the
mighty blast i was hurled into the air with a speed
the green girl



that swiftly increased to many hundreds of miles per
hour i hurtled the broad plain and over the ghostly
white city of silver-and into the abyss

  the plateau ended abruptly as if cut off with a knife
the crater fell sheer away before me stretching to the
vast blue cliffs in the north and to the line of living pur-
ple and green that marked the beginning of the eastward
forests only a thin green line separated the abyss from
the lake on the south which in the reflected light of the
scarlet sky horribly suggested a sea of blood ready to
flow into the pit

  undoubtedly the crater was of volcanic origin i could
not determine its depth nor the state of its floor-it was
filled with the thick crimson mist the wavering tongues
of violet fire still flickered through it throbbing
strangely like the reflection of fires below-hinting un-
pleasantly of alien life

  as the rich green plain vanished beneath me and i
sped high over that busy strange white city and into the
haze of the abyss an odd feeling of the wildness and the
unfamiliar terror of the place stole over me again i was
very thankful for the invention of sams for the thin
helmet of wire gauze above my head

  suddenly a great twisting bar of green fire writhed
up like a serpents head from the nest of flames it
swung and coiled and twisted through the rosy mists with
a slow deliberate motion like an incredible reptile of
flame raising its head looking searching despite the
helmet great fear swept my brain like a hot flame

chapter xxviii

the flaming brain

mighty winds whipped about me the roaring
jets of steam drove the throbbing machine on
over the rosy mists and over the flickering vio-
let flames and i fell-dropped into the hidden pit
vividly i saw the great writhing head of green rising
above the fire-fog ahead with that in its waving serpen-
tine motion that told me that its eyes were already upon
me i was certain that it was a living sentient entity
that it was intelligent

  could my weapons avail against it

  i fell through the rosy clouds the green and purple
rim of the abyss grew vague and the blue cliffs in the
north assumed a misty indistinctness the red mist
shone until it seemed that i was swimming in a fog of
crimson fire

  and all the while the bright beautiful face of xenora
was before me the light of her clear violet eyes drove
the strangeness and the fear from my mind leaving only
my pain at leaving her i drove the machine mechanic-
ally lost in a daze of grief

  for ages it seemed i shot forward through the haze
at last i made out a bare floor of sand and rocks pitted
with circular craters it was a good thousand feet be-
low and still dim in the haze i opened the bow tubes
and the force of my fall was checked in three minutes
more the machine struck the earth bow first it tore a
vast hole in the sand and rolled over twice coming to
rest on its side fortunately it had been built to with-
stand such knocks fortunately too i was strapped in
my cushioned seat

  i got the motors started and worked the machine to an
upright position the crater floor was visible for half

a mile about in all directions it was a dead desolate
waste of hard sand and twisted black volcanic rocks
further vision was cut off by the rosy mist that hung
above the floor

  then i saw far before me a bright violet gleam
through the crimson mist indistinctly i saw a broad
green shaft of pulsing fire rise from it to lose itself in
the crimson sky that intense violet light from which
the flickering reflections came and from which the green
beam reached up i knew must be the seat of the lord of
flame

  i started the engines once more and the machine rolled
mightily forward over the bare rocks with a great
clangor of metal upon stone forging ahead at last to meet
the alien menace it roared over bare sandy flats
rounded great boulders crashed into pits crawled
through craters then suddenly that terrible green
flame flared out toward me i knew that i had been dis-
covered  like a lance of green flame it flashed through
the red gloom above its motion was alert surprised
terrible

  i set the loading mechanism of the little gun to fire
high explosive and put it in action hurling shells in the
direction of that violet light and still i drove swiftly
on the flashes of the explosions were visible through
the mist ahead but the deep violet light still glowed

  i turned on the reserve power units and the machine
vibrated from their throbbing drone i threw another
switch and the deep purr of the giant transformers filled
the ship the mighty white tongue of the electric arc
reached out ahead of me

  and the omnimobile plunged on

  two of the silver spheres-the ships of mutron-ap-
peared before me with the green vortexes of the atomic
disintegration springing up about them the great arc
brought them down in incandescent wreckage almost as
soon as they came in view

  the violet mist grew brighter more distinct i knew
the shells were bursting near it and that the arc would
reach it soon the faithful old machine lumbered rapidly
on over the wild and twisted rocky desert-a waste as ter-
rible as the mountains of the moon

  in fact that crater-pitted floor bore a curious resemb-
lance to the typical lunar landscape and the forces that
produced them must have been similar

  then the mist cleared and i saw the form of the thing
that gave the violet light it was scores of feet thick
and hundreds tall it was a vast smooth cylinder of
violet fire it shone like metal which was white hot and
seen through violet glass the color of it ran and flick-
ered on the surface violet sheets and bands crawled
and flashed upon it and violet flame flowed away from it
in many little tongues the thing was perfectly smooth
and cylindrical five hundred feet in height-a titanic
monolith of metal

  still the omnimobile lumbered irresistibly onward
the little gun crashed regularly and the shells threw up
the earth about that weird cylinder half a mile ahead
and the great white flame of the arc was playing far out
toward it like the sword of the angel of death

  i saw a cluster of curious gleaming machines about the
base of the great cylinder one of my shells must have
struck them for they suddenly seemed to collapse and
dissolve in a cloud of white smoke

  abruptly a huge terrible bar of green fire rose from
the top of the cylinder almost like an extension of it-


amazing stories

it was like a beam of green light from a vast searchlight
but it bent and twisted as if it were alive it moved like
a snake writhed toward me

  and then came the catastrophe

  a great pit in the rocky desert suddenly appeared be-
fore me-a hundred-foot chasm i made a wild attempt
to swing the machine around it but busy with the arc
the generators and the gun i had seen it too late the
brink loomed before me desperately i set the brakes
the machine paused jerkily hesitated then leaped over
the rim for a breathless second it fell down the sheer
crater wall i had no time to use the rockets it
crashed heavily upon the rocks

  i was torn from my seat and flung cruelly against the
side of the conning tower my helmet was knocked off
and on the instant a red storm of fear broke about me
it beat down on my brain like a rain of horror it
throbbed with an archaic rhythm stirring strange emo-
tions that overruled my reason and volition terror
swept about me like a fierce wind from a hot desert of
death picking up my soul and sweeping it away to a fate
unnamable

  i struggled with it terribly with all my will but it
beat down my feeble barriers like a resistless tide it
burned away my will like a hot flame in my brain

  that horror came over me in a vast overwhelming
wave it seized my body my hand moved unwillingly
and cut off the current of the great arc and then my
body was struggling to its feet opening the manhole
and clambering out of the machine but still the thing
did not have me i was still an independent entity that
sat apart and watched

  i knew that i had succumbed to the hypnotic control of
the alien power that dwelt in that vast metal cylinder i
was another of the slaves of the lord of flame-of the
sleepers of mutron

chapter xxix

xenoras sacrifice

i was moved out of the machine like an automaton
by the terrible force that controlled me my body
was no longer my own it was swept along as if
by a mighty wind that force of horror roared and
throbbed in my brain red flames of fear flickered be-
fore my eyes i was sick and faint with terror but
my body did not collapse-it was relentlessly moved by
that terrible force from the violet cylinder i was utterly
helpless-i felt the hopeless horror of one chained
before a loathsome monster

  suddenly i wished fiercely for death for only death
could bring me freedom from the horror that swept in a
throbbing torrent through my brain but even death was
beyond my reach for my hands were not my own

  for a moment that power left me standing on the side
of the overturned machine the omnimobile lay on
the sandy floor of the crater which may have been a hun-
dred feet in depth and as many yards across against
the red sky above the black cliffs of the pits farther
rim towered the violet metal cylinder-the flaming metal
brain whose hypnotic control ruled my body

  for a moment i was left standing there and then my
body was springing down and running across the rock-
strewn sand toward the cliffs it ran like a machine-
beyond my control in vain i tried even to stumble and

fall in a few moments it reached the rim it clam-
bered wildly up i know that in my normal self i could
never have surmounted that sheer wall but the tele-
pathic force from the flaming brain seemed to give my
limbs superhuman strength soon i was at the top
with bleeding hands and tattered clothing

  and my body ran on toward the violet monostyle

  it was two hundred yards away-a titanic smooth up-
right cylinder of metal the polished surface crawling
and flowing with violet flame with the great incredible
serpent-like beam of green rising from the top

  it was astounding-in the strangeness of its aspect
and in its inexplicable suggestion of alien intelligence
but how could there be intelligence in metal 

  and then i saw the men about it

  two of the vast silver spheres were stopped on the
ground below the cylinder oddly dwarfed by its vast
height and about them were men they were the green
slaves-the sleepers of mutron their bodies were
naked but for tattered scraps of cloth fastened upon
their backs by the cruel metal clamps they bore the
strange prisms

  but those bars of metal were not blue like the one we
had taken from the dead man they shone with the
same mysterious violet radiance as the titanic inono-
style they were parts of it-akin to it

  the men moved like sleepers or like machines as i
felt that i was moving-as if their wills were dead
they toiled in tireless haste without confusion many
were carrying burdens and it seemed that some were
polishing the surface of the cylinder or applying some
luminous substance to it near the ground they were
quite plainly visible clinging to its surface like flies and
toiling furiously higher up on the colossal cylinder they
were but dancing black specks within the violet flame

  the ground about was pitted with shell holes from my
bombardment and at one side i saw the twisted wreck
of the great machine i had struck it is possible that
i had hit the great cylinder itself but it might have re-
ceived the fire of the biggest gun in christendom with
little injury

  in two minutes more i had been drawn to within fifty
yards of that vast shining column of metal then the
force of fear that had seized my body permitted it to
stop and i stood still that awful twisting beam of
green flame reached out of the top of the thing and bent
down over me it touched me

  i felt tiny whip-like fingers of it feeling-exploring
my body the green radiance grew denser about me
it enshrouded me in a fog of green light-so painfully
intense blinding and terrible that i tried to shut my eyes
against it but that horror held them open

  and that green fire came into my body and into my
brain it was eager insistent questioning-and so hor-
rible that my being rocked with pain it questioned it
commanded it sought to know of me and of my com-
panions of the omnimobile and of the world we had
left above i struggled against it fiercely terribly until
i felt my limbs chilling with the sweat of the conflict
but it won

  it took my mind as it had taken my body it beat
about my brain like a vast storm it penetrated my being
in a flood of green fire my brain reeled was swept by
an avalanche of awful power i sank at last into mer-
ciful oblivion that was the counterpart of the death i
had so desired
the green girl



  at last when i was vaguely conscious again i had a
curious feeling of mental exhaustion i felt as if i had
undergone a fearful ordeal i felt as if i had toiled as
i slept as if i had answered many questions put to me
by that power it seemed as if the green light had
swept the contents from my brain had searched all
my knowledge

   as i awoke bodily sensation returned and i felt some-
one lifting me gently from the bare earth upon which
i lay my limbs were cold and stiff but the awful force
that had controlled them was for the moment relaxed

  i opened my eyes and cried out first in incredulous
joy and then in utter despair xenora-the green
girl-was lifting my head there was anxiety and care
in her violet eyes and unutterable fatigue was shown in
her body she had followed me into the pit to give her
life with mine

  oh xenora my dream girl why did you come
there was no need for you to give your life i pro-
tested in bitter despair as she raised me in her arms and
held me against her breath

  i felt you battle with the lord of flame i felt
it conquer you so i left the camp to come

  and how in all wonders did you get into this pit
and so soon

  my chieftain it is not so soon for three sleeps i
have come through the forests and rocks without stop-
ping while you lay still in the power of the flame
but why-why-come to throw away your life-
see i bring you the wonderful thing of barsoni sam
that shuts out the horror i give it to you and you can
go on with your battle against the flame-no you can
never conquer the flame but fly go back to your
land

  even then i felt the horror awakening again felt that
fearful force directed again upon me with a single
quick motion before i could prevent her xenora had
whipped the electro-screen helmet from her head and
drawn it about my own

  fly she whispered fiercely the sleepers of mu-
tron  and think not of me fly even from me 
the horror relaxed and i collapsed in a daze of relief
in a moment i had recovered and got to my feet
xenora was a score of yards away dashing off i ran
after her calling for her to take back the precious
helmet	

  suddenly she stopped a convulsion ran through her
frame she turned with her face a mask of livid hor-
ror she was in the power of the flame she was a
sleeper she bent seized a rock and hurled it at my
head with superhuman strength i dodged and it hurtled
past my ear she sprang at me like an animal drawing
the hunting knife i had left her

  i turned and ran wildly as a score of the sleepers
came running i passed close by that violet metal mon-
ostyle and it seemed that its crawling violet fires reached
out for me i ran desperately toward the east i heard
the strange cries of the sleepers of mutron behind me

i felt the awful green flame writhing above me but even
it could not penetrate the helmet

  i was insane with terror

  i ran on and on through eternities of heart-breaking
effort at last i stopped exhausted with pounding
temples and bursting lungs to look behind me the
flaming brain was but a dull violet glow against the red
sky a desolate waste of bare rugged rocks and great

round craters lay about me beneath the crimson mist
all was silent the sounds of pursuit were gone

chapter xxx

the nitrate plantation

should i go on or return and try to save xenora
as she had rescued me that question throbbed
in my brain the answer would have been easy
enough if i had had her alone to consider i might
cheerfully have surrendered myself to that dreaded
power to save her-any man would have done as much
but what of the menace to the earth should i give
up the struggle

  for a long time i stood there on the rim of a strange
crater lost in indecision at last my sense of duty to
mankind was victor i set off wearily toward the east
again the omnimobile was so near the flaming brain
that i dared not attempt to reach it even if i had been
confident of finding it and upon consideration i was
sure that if the machine was left as it was it would be
only as a trap for me

  a sorry hope indeed was i for victory in the struggle
with that vast alien power for the safety of earth
a man alone ragged without even a pocket-knife lost
in the wilderness of a strange world and possessing only
a modicum of scientific knowledge

  what folly indeed for one in such circumstances to
pit himself against such a science but that seemed the
only hope for victory with sam in my place the out-
look would have been brighter if i had a fair scientific
education sam knew enough to raise cities and armies
in the wilderness

  for many hours i struggled toward the east-away
from the violet glow-over the desert of rocks and
craters through the ruby mist and i came unexpect-
edly upon an explanation for the origin of the crimson
haze thin clouds of red luminous gas were hissing
from some of the craters or funaroles-escaping from
the radium deposits in the core of the earth to float
up and augment the radioactive cloud that held up the
waters

  i was half dead with weariness when i reached the
mile-high cliffs at the craters rim and half insane with
grief for xenora and with angry doubt of my wisdom
in deserting her i have little memory of how i got up
that wall of rocks i remember climbing until i was
worn out of toiling upward with bleeding hands and
feet of fighting on when i was dizzy for want of food
and water of struggling up when my body screamed in
pain for me to surrender and drop to merciful oblivion
in the abyss i remember sleeping many times on ledges
or in crevices when i could go no farther

  but at last i reached the rim

  i climbed out upon the flat plateau to the east of the
abyss a strange wilderness of green plains and purple
trees but infinitely welcome after the tortures through
which i had been i stumbled across the meadows until
i found a little stream eagerly i wet my parched
mouth and presently i slaked my thirst and ate a few
of the date-like fruits of the flowering trees and then
i slept

  for a period of many months thereafter i led a
strange wild life-the life of a beast or a savage it
now seems to me that i must have been more than half


amazing stories

insane yet i had cunning of a sort wandering about
in the woodland in the first few days before my strength
was fully recovered i came upon a great lump of native
copper with hammer and anvil of stone i set out to
shape some tools of it first i made a knife and then
a broad blade for a wooden spear with those weapons i
soon had stalked and killed one of the great fat sloths
after several weary efforts i achieved a fire by friction
and feasted upon roasted meat

  many were the mad and impossible schemes that my
fevered brain formed for making an attack on the flam-
ing brain of metal only to reject each upon considera-
tion as i had hurtled through the air above the pit in my
ill-starred attack in the omnimobile i had been much
impressed by the narrowness of the bridge of cliffs be-
tween the great lake and the abyss now it occurred to
me that i might dig a canal and let the waters of the
lake in to flood the lord of flame

  with that in mind i made an expedition to the isth-
mus armed with copper pick and spade i found that
my eyes had curiously deceived me from the air the
land bridge was a wall of rock nowhere less than a hun-
dred feet high and four hundred thick covered with
a rank growth of jungle along it even as xenora had
said was a ruined road here and there a crumbling
stone monument rose from the jungle like a bleached
skull of the dead civilization

  there was no hope of digging a canal a hundred
men in ten years might have been able to cut a tunnel
through that wall of stone with modern tools and ex-
plosives nitroglycerine that started me on a new
line of thought i had once made chemistry a hobby it
was not impossible for sam it would have been childs
play but alas there was no help from my old friend

  i set to work at once for many months i labored
the task was a tremendous one the first necessity was
an adequate supply of nitrates i was not fortunate
enough to discover a natural deposit as heroes of
fiction usually are so i set out to make a nitrate
plantation such as is used for the manufacture of ni-
trates in a primitive way i dug a great shallow pit
lined it with waterproof clay and filled it with alternate
layers of wood ashes obtained by burning the purple
trees and everything i could pick up in the way of
nitrogenous animal and vegetable refuse at last it was
filled and wet down with water from my clay-bed i
had nothing to do but wait until the nitrogen products
of decomposition had united themselves with the potas-
sium bases in the wood ashes

  then i fell to the mining of iron pyrites and to the
building of a furnace in which i could burn my pottery
apparatus after many disheartening failures i was
able to set up apparatus that i thought would suffice for
the manufacture of my acids i burned rude jars glazed
with sand in which to carry and store my reagents and
explosives

  my memory of all that time is a dim dream of terror
many times for long hours i stood on the brink gazing
into the flickering mist thinking of xenora and half
determined to give it all up and to seek her but always
i went back to my mad task toiling in a daze of grief
and despair

  before i did anything more in the way of manufac-
ture i paid another visit to the isthmus and selected
the site for the mine which was to tear an opening in it
i found a deep crevice in the rocks and spent many

weeks in clearing and enlarging it until i had ready a
chamber deep in the heart of the barrier below the level
of the lake

  during all that time i lived upon the little fruits and
upon the flesh of the sloths i killed i carefully saved
the fat from the latter saponified it with alkalies leached
from wood ashes and removed the soap by salting
down with evaporated brine from a salt spring i col-
lected and stored the glycerine until i had many gallons

  at last judging that my nitrate plantation had had
time to serve its purpose i dug it up leached the prod-
uct and crystallized the saltpeter by evaporation in
earthen pots the yield was satisfactory in quantity
and fair in quality but it had cost fearful effort

  then i set about the manufacture of sulphuric acid
by roasting the iron pyrites with nitrate in my crude
apparatus collecting the acid in wet pottery condensers
that took many days and the next step was making
nitric acid by boiling saltpeter in sulphuric acid and
condensing the fumes

  at last when i had the three necessary chemicals-
glycerine and nitric and sulphuric acids-i set out to
transport them separately to my mine to avoid the
hazard of the transportation of the finished product
that again was a heartbreaking task for i had mate-
rials enough to make several hundred quarts of nitro-
glycerine and the distance was half a dozen miles

  but ragged ill-kept savage that i was i had collected
on the cliffs above my shaft the materials for the man-
ufacture of a good quantity of high explosive for one
in my position it had been a considerable achievement

chapter xxxi
the mine on the brink

  at last in haste and fear and trembling i began
the task of mixing my chemicals dumping them
- into vats of water cooled by evaporation under
a rude shed to cut off the fierce heat of the red sky
even with all my precautions to prevent a premature
explosion the hazard was fearful i washed the nitro-
glycerine and carried it in earthen jars down into the
heart of the cliffs i meant to die in the final explosion
but i was afraid the stuff would go off before it was
in place

  but finally i got the last of the rough jars into posi-
tion then i closed the mouth of the chamber with
rocks and rubbish to be sure that the full force of the
explosion would be exerted upon the cliff i lit the
fuse i had prepared-a tall candle of the sloths fat
which burning low would ignite a powder train and
that would set off a charge of gunpowder i had placed
by the jars of nitroglycerine

  i knew that if my terrible months of toil had not been
in vain a few hours more would see a raging torrent
of water rushing into the pit at last i judged my task
completed i walked a few yards north to the rim i
stood on the brink of that sheer precipice and gazed
down into the rosy mist alight as always with the
wavering reflected fires of the metal brain i made no
attempt to get beyond the range of the explosion plope
was dead life meant no more to me i was ready to
be swept into the abyss on the crest of the wave that
if my plans went well would drown the flaming brain

  for a long time i stood there waiting lost in dreams

in a strange semblance to military order they flew
like fleets of battle-planes    many of them i
saw carried weapons    and then a flight of
them swept downward again and i saw sam
mounted on one   

of xenora i had no doubt that she was dead my
regret was bitter i stormed vainly and passionately
at fate if my reason had been tottering now it was
almost gone i wept and cursed and then laughed
loud and bitterly a strange figure i must have
been wild and unkempt red and burned from ex-
posure half naked with insanity in my eyes laugh-
ing and waiting to be blown to my doom

  and then i heard a sound that brought me into
silent and cunning alertness i sprang to the mouth
of my shaft and crouched like a savage with my
great copper-bladed spear at hand i heard a stone


amazing stories

rattling and crashing down into the abyss someone-
or something-was climbing up out of the pit i crept
forward where i could see and lay tense and silent a
desperate madman determined to protect my mine
against whatever might find it

  at last a human figure clambered up over the brink
and drew itself erect in the edge of the jungle it was
a sleeper of mutron the emaciated form was bent
beneath the weight of the bar of gleaming violet metal
clamped upon its back it was clad in tattered bloody
rags the flesh was bleeding from the fearful climb

  with the dull mechanical motions of a sleeping per-
son or of a walking corpse galvanized by some weird
power that terrible figure got deliberately to its feet
the bloody hands raised a long glittering weapon of
silver metal and it plodded dully lifelessly toward
me and then a hoarse wild cry echoed through the
silent jungle-my own scream

  the sleeper was xenora

  with her old intuition of my thoughts she had been
able to penetrate my helmet through her the lord
of flame had read my thoughts of victory she had
been sent to prevent the mines explosion to snuff out
that candle flame

  if she heard my scream she paid no heed she walked
on toward me with the same weary mechanical gait
there was no light no life in her eyes they stared
straight ahead dully unseeing and the strange silver
tube was held ready in her hand she was more like a
moving corpse-a dead avenger-than a living person

  a mad storm of desires arose in my brain how i
longed to spring up to take that dear body in my arms
to minister to its hurts to have the green girl for my
own again it took all my will to hold me in my hiding
place but this was not xenora it was a sleeper of
mutron a slave of the lord of flame

  it was a fearful choice before me but my resolution
held i would carry on if it tore out my heart with
a burning pain in my breast i ran my fingers over the
jagged copper blade and tensed my muscles for a
spring

  perhaps after all we would be better dead

  my madness was gone but cold grim determination
remained i knew that i would not hesitate the silent
sleeping figure of the green girl was but a dozen yards
from me and i raised my ragged blade

  then-a shadow upon the crimson sky a whisper
that grew to a mighty roar the beat of many wings
a strange and ringing cry from the air above a
shouted imperative strange-toned command sams
well-remembered voice a rushing sweep of vast green
wings before my eyes a tempest of wind as they beat
the air xenora snatched up and out of my sight by
great red tentacles

  i was petrified in incredulous amazement it seemed
impossible that sam should be alive yet there had been
no definite proof of his death and i thought it must
have been alexander that carried him and that had
swept up xenora

  in a moment i had aroused myself and dashed out
of my hiding place beneath the purple trees it was an
amazing sight that met my eyes there were number-
less thousands of the flying plants on the wing above
the red sky was flecked with their green wings in a
strange semblance to military order they flew like fleets
of battle-planes in scores and hundreds they dived and

circled in perfect formation many of them i saw car-
ried weapons-vast clubs or huge metal-tipped spears
or heavy stones and masses of metal

  and then a flight of them swept downward again and
i saw sam mounted on one that must have been alex-
ander-though the things all looked alike to me he was
evidently controlling the whole squadron with his shouts
and gestures the old scientist still seemed strong and
able

  then i saw xenora she was still in the clutch of the
winged steed of sams even as i looked the red tenta-
cles tore off the flaming violet prism and hurled it into
the abyss

  the weird amazing creature dived an incredible
thing it was with its armored brown body as large as a
sharks with the vast flower of the flowing colors about
its head with red tentacles like those of a gigantic scarlet
octopus and with wings like those of a green airplane

  it bore down upon me a great crimson tentacle
reached down and picked me up i was swept through
the air held lightly in that strange grasp and lifted until
i was face to face with sam who sat astride the creature
he reached out his strong brown hand and grasped my
own

  mel old man its some luck to find you and what
do you think of my army a couple of the flying
dragons captured alec and me so ive been making the
best of a bad situation the things are really quite in-
telligent and ive been drilling them for months theyre
hereditary enemies of the alien civilization anyhow
theres going to be some fight when we meet the silver
ships exultant joyous triumph rang in his tones
he had not noticed my strange condition

  at last i was sufficiently recovered to speak ive
got a ton of nitroglycerine in that rock i stammered
the lake will be running in the pit in an hour or so
my voice had a curious rusty sound

  nitroglycerine youve been making it and planting
a mine  no wonder you look like a ghost and how
comes xenora to have that damned metal bar on her

  abruptly i broke down into uncontrollable tears of
relief and joy i did not try to answer in a few min-
utes the vast army of winged monsters had wheeled
about and was headed north again over the crimson
mists-line after regular line of beating green wings
that bore the strangest army of history to the strangest
battle ever fought

  but at the moment i was paying little attention for
i was mounted on another of those vast flying creatures
and in my arms was xenora she was limp uncon-
scious sleeping the sleep of utter exhaustion but she
was free again from the lord of flame with tears of
joy streaming down my face i tried to dress her bleed-
ing hands and feet

chapter xxxii
when the red roof fell

  a bruptly a green light ran through the rosy
haze beneath us and that dreadful twisting bar
- of radiance-that living alien tongue of fire-
the serpent-like head of the lord of flame was thrust
up out of the flickering violet with its strange writh-
ing motion it swept in a wide arc as though it saw us
it searched the sky and then drew back in alarm the
the green girl



terrible rhythmic throb of the emerald gleam in it grew
faster

  and quickly the crimson sky ahead of our flying army
of green-winged monsters was filled with fleets of the
silver spheres they rose swiftly by the hundred in
lng gleaming lines-floating drifting darting as
though carried in swift cyclonic winds and then in
smoothly sailing squadrons they advanced to meet us
with the swirling green mists of the disintegration force
reaching out before them

  the aerial battle-lines met the winged monsters
joined in mad conflict with the silver ships it was a
fierce struggle-a terrible scene the plant-things swept
to the attack scores in number for each great ship
with desperate incredible energy they wielded their
gigantic clubs and spears or wheeling high above the
silver vessels dropped their missiles down upon them

  and the swift searching fingers of purple flame
reached out of the silver ships to guide the thick swirl-
ing vortexes of atomic disintegration under that ter-
rible force of flowing green the plant creatures turned
red battled on for a moment as they glowed with an
awful scarlet radiance and fell in a rain of crimson
sparks that fast faded into nothingness

  and ever the throbbing emerald column rising above
the sea of ruby mist below us-the writhing serpentine
bar of green that was the lord of flame-moved and
twisted directing its armies

  the plants battled with desperate ferocity with in-
credible strength in ones and twos and threes the sil-
ver vessels fell in twisted battered wreckage-fell
among the showers of sparks from the vanished crea-
tures that had crushed them

  it was a battle of animal strength and courage of
desperate savage energy-against deliberate inhuman
science it was the battle of the mad elemental beast-
against silent pitiless power

  and the plants won

  as the monsters that carried sam and xenora and
myself swept along high above the line of battle we
saw the silver ships give way saw them drop into the
red mist with the avenging victorious plants following
close upon them

  and then my mine went off

  a vast white cloud of smoke and shattered rock rose
deliberately above the cliffs spread into a titanic mush-
room shape and fell in a great rain of debris into the
abyss and into the lake after many seconds the sound
of it reached us-a crashing deafening blast the
great wave of air swept up the green-winged fleet like
leaves on a stormy lake

  below the cloud of smoke where the black cliffs had
been i saw a vast white sheet of waters-a rushing ni-
agara multiplied manifold-plunging over the brink in
a sheer and gleaming arc

  even as i gazed at it in dazed wonder at the thing
i had wrought sam was suddenly close beside me
shouting something with alarm and urgent command in
his voice

  mel-the roof where is the omnimobile for
gods sake--

  in a crater in the abyss by the metal cylinder i
cried wondering

  then i looked up and saw that the flat roof was
cupping up like a vast inverted basin the waters
above were rising

  with no further word to me sam shouted a strange
order to the monsters we rode their vast green wings
were folded we dropped like plummets into the crim-
son mist the violet gleam appeared and we made out
the crater-pitted floor i shouted directions and in a
few minutes we settled into the same little crater in
which i had met disaster

  the omnimobile was still lying there just as i had
left it

  the creatures that bore us dropped near the ground
those great red tentacles set us gently down on the
rocks by the machine sam led the way and i carried
xenora desperately we scrambled aboard and screwed
down the manhole sams mount alexander slumped
into a curious attitude of dejection

  suddenly one of the silver vessels shot into view above
thecraters rim drifting swiftly towards us the machine
was watched it had been left as a trap the thing
flashing beams of purple flame reached out eagerly-
found the omnimobile the whirling spirals of thick
green mist extended toward us

  sam fumbled with the dials and made a hopeless ges-
ture then i saw alexander spring into the air and fly
toward the terrible gleaming thing with mad des-
perate speed the plant creature dashed straight into that
fearful swirling mist it charged on through it al-
ready glowing red with the disintegration beam it struck
the white machine with terrific force

  the argent globe paused hung uncertainly and then
fell with swift acceleration until it crashed upon the
walls of the pit with the gleaming wasting form of the
heroic plant still clinging to it in the agony of a fearful
doom

  for a long moment sam was still suddenly he
aroused himself as if from a daze of pain and turned
again to the instrument boards

  the earth is not frozen he shouted the power
in the ether is dead i thought of the havoc my cannon
fire had wrought with the machines about the flaming
brain

  in a moment he had the generators going and the
machine crawling to an upright position then he
turned on the rocket tubes the crater was filled with
the roaring jets of steam and we were hurled into
the crimson sky

  i had a fleeting glimpse of the metal brain-the vast
cylinder of violet-with the green beam still throbbing
from it and with the last of the silver ships battling
the victorious army of plants that swarmed about it

  the roof is lifting sam cried the equilibrium
was very delicate-the gas that kept issuing from the
earth was lifting the waters to the danger point and
your explosion carried them past the attempt to freeze
the earth was probably undertaken because a roof of
ice would have been more secure

  his voice was drowned in a fresh rushing whistling
burst from the rocket tubes i carried the inert form
of xenora down to the cabin and did my best to care
for her in a few moments we were above the haze

i took a last glimpse of the green and purple forests
dropping away below us and turned again to the un-
conscious girl

  soon the fierce red glare that poured in the ports
told me that we had reached the red roof and sud-
denly the omnimobile was pitching and spinning madly
with wild waters thundering against her sides a sound


amazing stories

reached my ears-a roar dull distant and slumberous
at first but rising to a crashing deafening storm of
sound it seemed an eternity that i held the sleeping
girl upon the tossing couch while the very heavens
rocked with thunder

  abruptly the bloody glare grew lighter and was
streaked with shafts of bright sunshine-white precious
sunlight of the upper earth we had followed the vast
bubble of gas through the roof of waters the red
mists cleared-drew up into the blue vault above-re-
pelled into outer space

  we were flying in the cold white light above a mad
blue sea

  in fifteen minutes sam had brought the machine
down upon an ocean that was still heaving madly from
the cataclysm that had drowned a world he came into
the cabin and under his skilful ministrations xenora
was soon sleeping quietly in a normal slumber from
which she would wake herself again

  presently sam questioned me about my adventures

i	gave him the whole account and concluded with the
question that for months my troubled mind had striven
so vainly to answer

  sam how could intelligence exist in metal 

  why not in metal mel the old scientist replied
smiling thoughtfully why not there as well as in
lumps of impure carbon and water as one of the early
savants called us but do you remember the radio-
activity of the metal bar and the little cells of helium
gas in it i think the radium had somehow set up
neuronic circuits between the cells like the circuits be-
tween the neurone cells in our brains it is not impos-
sible that was a helium brain-but it was formed
as naturally as yours or mine

  on may   a d just a year after the beginning
of my story our leisurely homeward cruise was ended
the green coast of florida rose out of the clear blue
sea before us xenora and i stood on the deck happy
in the cool salty air and the bright sunlight the girl
was lost in vast delight at the new wonders of azure
sea and sapphire sky at last the dream of my life was
come true

  the wonderful girl of my fancy was by my side to
be mine forever

  but she was the green girl no longer a week of
the sun and wind of the sea had erased the soft green
tint of her clear skin and replaced it with a light
smooth tan

the conquest of the earth



          by isaac r nathanson

                 continued from page 

  of course there was great danger in handling the
whole thing such vast forces could not be released with-
out the possibility of its getting out of control altogether
and destroying the whole earth but the condition of
mankind was insufferable and as far as one could fore-
see the end was not yet far better a thousand deaths
than to be dominated and driven about like wild beasts
it was solemnly decided that come what will here was
a weapon that offered the only possible salvation-a
most terrible infinitely powerful weapon the soul of
man rose to its supreme height

  the execution of the project called for a vast amount
of labor and the highest technical skill in its preparation
but willing hands there were and keen brains and
desperation had increased everyones energy to bring
about tire desired result the atomic conflagration had to
be started right in the midst of the enemy preferably in
many places at once the technique of induction was a
long and skilful process and required a specially trained
technical knowledge which few possessed in fact it
was extremely difficult to induce this excitation in view
of the newness of the process which like all new dis-
coveries lacked refinements and improvements such as
only the years can develop but once started the heat
generated by the liberated forces within the atoms
roared with an explosive fierceness unapproachable and
inextinguishable

  a selected number of highly skilled technicians drawn
from men of every nation and clime were trained under
dr hopkins who carefully and patiently imparted to
them the difficult technique of the new discovery every-
where in every place of refuge in far-off lands of the
world men and women labored-grimly tirelessly and
determinedly it took over a year to complete the full
preparations

  a day came when all was in readiness as night
descended with its enshrouding mantle over the different
parts of the earth those entrusted with the final execu-
tion of the great strategy fared forth several scores
of the new racing planes each starting from a specifi-
cally selected point sped straight for the enemy in the
darkness at a tremendous height they raced on at over
six hundred miles an hour toward their definite ob-
jectives it was a very dangerous undertaking the
population of the andromedans had by now become very
dense in many selected spots free of the enemy but
in the heart of their territory landing parties were to
start the process which would release the intra-atomic
forces this usually took several hours and probably
only a few of the landing parties would succeed-but
that was enough

  with palpitating hearts with nerves strained to the
breaking point the result was awaited of the hundreds
of planes only twenty-three returned they reported
complete success

tti story records that the last effort of mankind

  a succeeded- will forever go down as the year
of the great deliverance

  in many places in widely scattered parts right in the
midst of the enemy the irresistible atomic fires had
been started by the time the andromedans had fully
wakened to the full seriousness of their danger the
conflagration had spread to an extent there was no stop-
ping with all their knowledge with all their science
and skill with all the tremendous power at their disposal
they were unable to quench the fiery spread

  although the andromedan civilization was much older
and more developed in many ways they had never suc-
ceeded in solving completely the problem of controlling
intra-atomic energy the energy which they utilized-
the nature of which we never discovered though most
likely it was a partial tapping of atomic force-was
powerful and terrible enough and we had been unable
to cope with it but they knew not how to cope with
or control this new fierce energy which we released and
it was this supreme stroke of human genius which finally
overwhelmed them

  in vain they tried every method in vain with every
means at their command they strove to halt its deadly
march the blinding glare lit the skies night could
scarcely be told from day roaring deadly gases en-
veloped larger and larger areas until finally the con-
tinuing spread of the all-devouring conflagration had
grown to such proportions over such large areas that the
andromedans realized it was only a matter of time when
they would all be consumed in its roaring flame

  they made a tremendous effort to escape from this
earth let mankind perish in the fires which it started
a world suicide when the atomic fires encircled the
entire earth a new star bereft of all life would an-
nounce itself in the firmament-so they thought as re-
vealed by records they left behind their whole energies
were devoted toward building vast numbers of their
space-traveling globes to take them back to their re-
mote homeland the clang and din of their hurried and
desperate efforts to escape was a sight for the gods the
ever-spreading flames a constant urge

  and now the last of the andromedans departed from
the earth with the deprecations and curses of all hu-
manity many perished in the flames the few remain-
ing were put to death as in their terribly disorganized
state they could offer no adequate resistance

  then began a race with the all-spreading atomic blaze
and here was where our complete preparations saved
the earth for us mountainous quantities of the only sub-
stance capable of stopping the world conflagration had
been manufactured and held in readiness an entire will-
ing humanity young and old buckled down to the hercu-
lean task of building barriers of this insulating stuff-
which the andromedans knew nothing of each area in
the grip of the fiery disintegration was completely sur-
rounded by these barriers and when the flames reached
these they could spread no further everyone knew that
in a few years the burning areas would gradually burn
themselves out

could think of no good reason for the mans wet hands
other that that it had been raining and in climbing in by
the window he had wet his hands but quite obviously
had his hands been wet when he first entered the room
they would not have remained wet during the time that
he crept on his dozing victim strangled him searched
through his pockets and perhaps ripped open the bags
before killing the bird

  moreover the presence of the fingerprints on the door
convinced me that he had decided to leave that way and
had changed his mind and had gone by the window
why should he have taken even that risk of going by the
door rain hard rain again i decided and your an-
swers to my enquiries proved that it had rained severely
during that night i could not picture the murderer
soaked and dripping climbing into the window to commit

murder besides if it had been raining the occupant of
the room would in all likelihood have closed and bolted
his window before he dozed off yet i felt sure the
man who had killed the bird had just come in from the

must have left the room and returned to it after it began

a tool or an instrument with which to cut open the bags

but the credit is not mine the credit should go to the

editor amazing stories

  below is given another report of the science
correspondence club

  in previous reports to the discussions columns of
amazino stories my letters have been rather
vague in furnishing definite information to readers
who may wish to join the science correspondence
club therefore quoting from our constitution
we give the following information which will
interest your readers

article ii

  the institution will remain an organization to
establish better co-ordination between the scien-
tifically inclined laymen of the world regardless
of sex creed color or race there will be no
restrictions as to age providing the members can
pass an examination which shall be prepared by
the membership committee dont be alarmed by
the word examination as it really isnt an exami-
nation but merely a glance into the prospective
members sincerity and capabilities it embodies
no question or form

  let us look at article iv

  the dues shall be  per annum and will go
toward publication and distribution of the club
paper and a stipulated amount of stationery for
each member

  these arc just two of the more important articles
from the constitution which will be furnished
free to every reader interested hitherto i have
been lax in expressing my sinccrest appreciation to
dr sloane and amazing stories for the wonder-
ful co-operation and reception of our club they
have given and here is a little bit of interesting

information dr sloane has become an honorary
member and the club feels it has acquired a real
scientist in a previous letter i mentioned dr
breuer jack williamson and david speaker as
members in the authors class what do i find
when i look at the lists now harl vincent robt
a wait chas cloukey ed earl repp raymond
a palmer have all enrolled and are giving their
knowledge scientists dr r s rawson md
john e mellish honorary at yonkers observa-
tory and nationally known telescope maker
dr sloane honorary mr hugo gernsback and
that greatest of amateur astronomers f b cason

  truly science fiction through the aid of
amazing stories and its sister publications is
going to be recognized as the greatest medium to
spread science instructively and recreationally at
the same time and it is the aim of the science
correspondence club to spread science by personal
contact of the laymen of the world to this end
the founders of this club are devoting their lives
and what greater and better thing can be said of
anyone he helped his fellowmen

editor amazing stories

  mr dennis whose letters have appeared in your
publication has subscribed my name as collabo-
rator to several of the letters therefore i feel
that it is only proper that i write a letter to your
publication in my own behalf and that one about
the science correspondence club since so lucid
an explanation of the purposes and aims of the
club has been given by mr dennis and several
other members i do not think it necessary that i
follow their example i only wish to speak to
those who want to join the club

  the club has taken great strides to the fulfill-
ment of its wishes we set a limit of  mem-
bers for  that is we looked forward to such
a number and now we find with gratification that
we have over  members and many applications
are pending every one of our officers and mem-
bers is literally swamped with a sea of letters
however this is a welcome burden

  we are indeed gratified that you have conde-
scended to become an honorary member of our
society i am sure that you will find this club
interesting both as an individual and as editor of
amazing stories

  now i want to say something about a new
policy of the amazing stories i find it a better
magazine than it was and in one respect it has
taken a tremendous change for the better by
this i mean the illustrations i do not wish to be-
little pauls illustrations i enjoyed them im-
mensely and i am sure every one of your many
readers agree with me however i should say

the iron star by john taine pub-
lished by e p dutton  co new

  york 

this new book by mr taine is on
a par with the gold tooth and the
purple sapphire in certain re-
spects it is even better since it gives us a
wonderful character study of one of
these obnoxious reforming fanatics who
are forever trying to force their views and
beliefs down the throats of the unwilling

  one of the main figures in the book is
one swain son of a revivalist a narrow-
minded religious maniac whose chief aim
in life is the refuting of the darwinian
theory working on the well-known prin-
ciple the end justfies the means he first
studies medicine graduates with high hon-
ors and then goes to the congo as a mis-
sionary through his uncanny talent in
learning the native dialects he becomes
head of a secret cult whose aim is the
extermination of all apes like all re-
ligious fanatics he not only kills but de-
lights in torturing the poor helpless brutes
by burning them alive but fate over-
takes him a scotch explorer mckay
a giant of a man a scoffer and a heavy
drinker slyly introduces him  to a mys-
terious substance an incredibly heavy
metal which emanates rays of a peculiar
nature these rays or emanations first
create a condition resembling complete in-
toxication and leave an insatiable craving
for additional doses at the same time
these rays change the chemical composi-
tion of all the glands in the body they
stimulate the glands responsible for
growth but reverse the effects of the
glands governing the manifestations of
brain and soul in other words the ad-
dicts turn back to a state below that of
the apes

  swains wife and daughter succumb to
the insidious rays mckay who in the
meantime found the chief source of the
mysterious substance in a vast meteoric
deposit is himself succumbing but still
has reason enough left to dispatch swain
to chicago in order to summon scientists
to destroy this substance swain goes to
chicago meets several scientists who be-
come interested in his case without know-
ing the entire truth and an expedition is
started for the congo there swain dis-
appears but is tracked to a valley contain-
ing a cavern where they find a large
quantity of this heavy substance  while

they are watching swain remove a small
fragment of it they are attacked by a
large gang of near-human ape-like crea-
tures under leadership of a truly gigantic
male whom they dub the captain a
few of the gang not in harmony with
the captain are killed forthwith and
then the captains reason snaps and he
kills the entire gang singlehanded the
captain gets his arm shattered and mutely
applies for help he gets medical atten-
tion and thereafter is their friend guide
and ally the scientists in the mean-
time have examined the mysterious heavy
substance and classed it as an entirely
new element hitherto unknown upon the
earth which they name asterium the
captain who has degenerated so far that
he is without speech displays the greatest
aversion to asterium and leads them
to another large deposit of this substance
here the emanations are very strong but
they manage to set tip an x-ray machine
and succeed in disintegrating the asterium
which explodes with terrific force the
disintegrating once started cannot be
stopped and as the asterium permeates
the whole countryside a cataclysm of hor-
rible grandeur takes place the expedi-
tion survives however though the captain
is killed the survivors finally land safe-
ly in chicago where a letter left by
swain furnishes the necessary explana-
tions

  the iron star is a very entertaining
book which can honestly be recommended
to all lovers of fantastic literature-

mystic stories

others who returned by h r wake-
field published by d appleton  co

 new york 

this volume contains  stories which
will be welcomed by the mystically
inclined and condemned by those
whose minds demand an explanation mr
wakefields style is very agreeable and
reads well some of the stories are
pathetically touching and beautiful as for
instance present at the end all
of the stories are charmingly written
and very ably constructed they contain
descriptions of unexplained mysteries and
accidents leading to unsolved deaths
transmitted taints and evil influences
which continue beyond the grave but all
without any explanation whatever it is
absolutely up to the reader to furnish

the explanation if he can for that reason
it must appeal to the mystic-c a b

a satirical novel

deutschland ohne deutsche germany
  without germans by hans heyck
  published by i staackmann leipzig
  germany 

the german publishers have adopted
the american custom of furnishing a
short synopsis on the inside jacket of
the book to me it seems a good custom
most of the german jackets praise their
books profusely and almost all titles are
misleading superlatives and super-super-
latives are employed with a deplorable
lavishncss the book is advertised as a
satire of the importance of a work of
swifts it is they say a mirror of the
future and a picture of humanity in gigan-
tic dimensions looking at the book with
an unbiased eye it seems to us a fairly
well written entertaining tale dealing with
a germany submerged in a sea of foreign
immigrants chiefly negroes and in the
hands of exploiting coteries of rich ad-
venturers who have succeeded in a gen-
eral standardization of everything even
before the world war anything foreign
-all foreign customs and habits-were
looked upon with awe and respect this de-
plorable weakness got worse after the war
and deutschland ohne deutsche shows
unmistakable signs of it but perhaps
it is only the much-mentioned satire let
us give herr heyck the benefit of the
doubt

  the story deals with the project of
driving a tunnel through the centre of the
earth to connect australia with europe
this project has been proposed by a ger-
man engineer called big linus like
most of the newer german books this
one is also amply laced with all kinds of
english expressions big linus a mul-
timillionaire works secretly to solve the
problem of how to recreate a new ger-
many by secretly segregating all good and
true germans in the northern part of
sweden and finland which he bought out-
right his nephew as his heir who is
supposed to carry on this project has to
flee from germany after having fallen
foul of their laws he safely lands in
sweden while the tunnel blows up through
volcanic eruptions

  the technical part describing the con-
struction of the tunnel is well handled
the rest failed to impress-c a b

that paul has the architects viewpoint he sees
things as matters of lines and surfaces in

ever his failing that lie has standardized his
people you have perhaps noticed that all his
people wear breeches which spread like those used
in the cavalry no doubt this is the artists con-
ception of people of the future but it does not
strike a convincing note however your present
artistic staff is fine in particular i find briggs
a fine artist i can take up your magazine with
the firm conviction that i will find in it the
cream of scientific fiction

  thank you for your letter all we can say is
that our staff literary and artistic is putting
its best efforts into amazing stories we
hope you will continue to like it more and more
but always we must be guided by our readers
and the onlyway we cando that is to continue to
receive reports-as it were-from them on the
various issues of both the monthly and the
quarterly we feel that the science correspond-
ence club has started its career in an auspicious
manner long may it continue we know you
will find such men as dr breuer harl vincent
and the more distinctively scientific men in your
ranks most valuable accessions as consulting
scientists we also know personally that most
of the men whose names you mentioned will do
what they can to help keep the science correspond-

the rocket in interplanetary
travel
editor amazing stories

  as one who has at odd times actually worked
on what could be-theoretically-an agency for
interplanetary travel may i put in a word on
that matter

  of all the purely kineto-mechanic ideas for a
means to reach say the moon or even farther a
rocket is by all means the most possible but as
mr sloane rightly says the acceleration-risk is
a very real one but again if my elevator ex-
periences are at all normal a person in any
ascending mechanism loses the inertia-made in-
crease of weight once inertia is overcome so
the rocket-ship appears not impossible

  my own experiments have been with the idea
of changing ionic or atomic motion into mass
motion in an electromagnet and for amusement
i have written two interplanetary tales on that
basis a hollow cylinder carrying in it its own
power would theoretically be capable so excited
to continue its acceleration to the speed of motion
per se actually the limit even in space would
be the crystallizing point and as its crew would
partake of the same acceleration no external
inertia would act on them

  our field and a difficult one for any author
would be to write in first person a tale by say a
saturnian i tried twicc had fair success in
one very short one but in writing the same per-
sons autobiograph-i-i-i have worked on
it off and on for eleven months not half done
the difficulty is to think and write as a saturnian
rather than a terrancan there is the stumbling
block as mr h p lovecraft points out

  how about stories of other dimensions one
giving a theorem of a tesseract was in its mechan-
ical side excellent incidentally certain wise
ones in pre-cometic atlantis and antillea
had a table of the dimensions up to either eight-
een or twenty-one and held that the seventh was
directly accessible from the third

l partridge

box  cornish maine

   it is hard to see or to conceive of any vehicle
which would be driven through space where there
is virtually a vacuum by any means other than
reaction and reaction we take as meaning rocket
propulsion at least this is a convenient way of
expressing it as regards the stories which you
have been working on we can only say to you
what we say to so many others send them in to
us and we will be delighted to have them read and
to give them full consideration in our editorial
department we wish to have new authors for we
want to keep the magazine very original and to
avoid its being dry or dull or too mathematical
we hope that your suggestions will be taken up by
some of our authors for they are really very
good and original-editor

cold light

editor amazikg stories

  the story cold light in your november issue
is a scientific and literary treat

                        geo h davenport

          west nd st los angeles cal
the subject of cold light and the awful waste
and that is not too strong ail expression inci-
dental to artificial illumination has received so
much attention of late years that wo feci that our
story cold light which you so highly appreciated
was extremely timely especially as it was written
by one who thoroughly understands his subject
the incandescent lamp gives but a very small per-
centage back of the energy which it receives in the
shape of light of course it absorbs all the energy
given to it but a great part of the energy goes
off as obscure invisible ether rays if we may so
term them simply heat radiation using the old-
fashioned term of what has been called classic
physics-editor

something about the correspond-
ence club-theory of the
aurora borealis

editor amazing stories

  i will pass over the elaborate praise indulged
in by most of your correspondents because they
seem to have about used up all the adjectives in
the language and anyway the old a s can
stand on its own merit and it wont be in the
back row cither

  i have a problem i believe you can help mo
with if you will hero it is

  in collaboration with walter dennis of chi-
cago i have evolved an hypothesis as to the origin
of the aurora borealis which we believe to be
entirely original and which seems to fit every
known fact would you advise me to seek recog-
nition of it by some national astronomical so-
ciety or would it be better to send it to a maga-
zine of science is there any merit award at-
tached to a solution of this problem such as hon-
orary degrees etc now a word about the
science correspondence club we have over one
hundred and thirty  members

  dont you think it about time we got a little
recognition for instance a page devoted to
club business such as list of new members ad-
dress of officers and feature the best article dis-
coveries theories etc submitted each month by
the members thus each member would have an
opportunity to present his ideas to the entire club
and any faults or fallacies as well as good points
be immediately found and argued pro and con
by the correspondents

  well-wishing and boosting for the s c c
and our magazine i remain

                    e w smith

           church st ottumwa iowa
there is no prize offered for the solution of
such a problem as you speak of if the solution
was a wonderful triumph of science some degree
of recognition would undoubtedly follow we
think you might correspond with one of the great
observatories such as the national observatory of
washington or with the head of the weather
bureau and see if you could get them interested
it would be quite a triumph for the correspondence
club if you could get adequate recognition of your
work we will take into consideration what you
say about recognition of the science club for
the present you can do much by writing such let-
ters as this telling us of your progress which we
consider quite remarkable we will be glad to
give you some space in the magazine to report your
progress-editor

a tribute to g peyton werten-
baker from a brother author

editor amazing stories

  every now and then you publish a really first-
class piece of scientifiction one that ranks with
the good literature of the day and is worthy of
living in some more permanent form than the
covers of a magazine this time i wish to con-
gratulate you on the chamber of life by g
peyton wertenbaker

   scientifiction primarily must entertain in that
way it differs from science which may or may not
entertain for the principal function of a scientific
article is something far different from entertain-
ment but in order that a short-story by this
term i mean the vry specialized form of literature
that has developed during the past fifty years with
a scientific foundation be entertaining it has to
fulfill some other rather stringent and difficult re-
quirements some sort of a raving fancy a wild
incoherent hodge-podge of machinery or of stunts
with rays or hypnotism or impossible apparatus or
some melodramatic adventures in the middle of

life of
the party

i frankly admit that until recently
i was about the most awkward blush-
ing wallflower who ever dared to go to a
party

but my life has certainly changed instead
of overhearing myself referred to as an
old oil can it seems now as though the
fellows and girls cant pay enough atten-
tion to me now every time the gang
throw a party they insist that i come

dont think im bragging i remember all
too keenly what it felt like to be a lone-
some dud in the midst of a lively crowd
and im so thankful to a certain prof
dunninger for my new found popularity
that i am only too glad to give the credit
where it belongs

some time ago i read an ad just as youre
doing now about dunningers famous book
-popular magic and card
tricks as it cost only c with
money-back-if-not-satisfied guarantee i
thought id try it

i received the book by return mail and was
amazed to see how easy it was to do ma-
gicians trices in short order i became
expert in performing a dozen or more
mysterious stunts that astounded every-
one myself mot of all

at the next party i went to i gave a one-
man show that simply overwhelmed the
whole gang for an hour or more i made
cards fly glass bowls disappear coins van-
ish performed secret mind reading-in
short held my audience dumbfounded and
completely mystified

you too can entertain and astound your
friends-win greater popularity-experi-
ence countless evenings of enjoyment with
the more than  magic tricks this book
explains in simple english and easy to
understand pictures

 south america or on venus among some carica-
 tures of beings who express the inconsistencies of
 the authors psychology rather than any scientific
 principles-these things cannot possibly be enter-
 taining to a person with an orderly mind a scien-
 tific training and a taste for good literature
 there are many such persons and they deserve a
 good story now and then scientifiction can only
 entertain by sticking close enough to the orderli-
 ness of probability to resemble science at least
 superficially and then by leading off the imagina-
 tion of the reader on paths of exploration and
 speculation that actually do lead somewhere
 without breaking his iraaginationary neck

     scientifiction has a definite mission in literature
 to be successful to receive the approbation of in-
 telligent people to live in the literary world it
 must do one of three things  it must express
 some new idea some step forward in scientific
 imagination it must look forward to what can be
 done and probably will be done  it must
 carry over scientific atmosphere and scientific in-
 formation in a palatable form to the non-scientific
 reader the busy mans best way of getting a
 whiff of geology is through a good geological
 scientifiction story  or it must display the
 interaction between human nature and scientific
 progress after all the most interesting things
 about science are not its own facts but what it does
 to people

    mr wertenbaker has remarkably fulfilled the
 third but especially the first of these requirements

 i think his chamber of life is a brilliant con-
 ception it is a perfection and idealization of what
 we try to accomplish when we read a story or a
 book or go to a movie it is entertainment
 carried to its highest refinement in a way it is
 but a simple logical conception merely one step
 in reasoning ahead of the souud-and-color movie
 but that is what all really great things are simple
 it is the great and simple thing that moves us not
 the vast complex labored efforts to soar and to
 cover the universe mr wertenbakers idea
 certainly made a very powerful impression on my
 mind

    the other quality of excellence in his story is of
 course the workmanlike manner in which he put
 it together i know nothing about him and am
 quite curious to know if he is a professional
 writer correct stort-story technic requires prin-
 cipally a proper knowledge of psychology the psy-
 chology of the reader and of the characters in
 the story and mr wertenbaker evidently has
 these and has constructed a story that combines
 tile two things that one does not see combined as
 often in scientifiction as one would like-a clever
 original conception and good story-technic

    i hope you can get more stories like it both
 from him and from others like him

 this letter from dr breuer whom we claim
 as one of our leading authors tells its own story
 and requires no comments by us our satisfaction
 in it is based on the idea that so high an authority
 as its writer really agrees with the general methods
 of the editors of amazing stories because we
 are not only trying to please our readers but we
 are trying to do a good piece of work as regards
 science literature interest and romance avoiding
 dryness and in spite of some transgressions
 sticking pretty closely to correctness and making a
 very large allowance for the utilization of what may
 bo termed scientific impossibility-editor

the einstein theory from a stu-
dent of its laws-fourth
dimension stories

editor amazing stories

   being a devoted reader of your periodical al-
most since its first appearance i have had the
opportunity to read nearly every story that you
published dealing with the fourth dimension
and other phases of the einstein theory of rel-
ativity these stories are always of especial
interest to me as relativity is a subject to which
i have devoted several years of study

   in the latest january issue i see a letter
from an english reader objecting to further pub-
lication of this type of story claiming that time-
traveling and similar stories are unfair to ii g
wells whose the time machine was the first
and best of this nature to be written however

i cannot agree with your correspondent i be-
lieve that if an author can offer a new suggestion
on this subject or make an improvement over
older stories he is certainly entitled to do so
and i will say that i have not yet read a single
fourth dimension story that did not contain some
new original and ingenious idea or suggestion
of course nearly every story of this nature you
have published is at variance in some phase with
every other story and i have not yet found one
which agrees with my own conception of the
fourth dimension outside of the statement that
that dimension is time however to get to the
real purpose of this letter

   the most interesting fourth dimension stories
i have read are those of dr miles j breuer and
clare winger harris i consider mrs harris
the fifth dimension something of a master-
piece freshest in my memory is a baby on
neptune which these two authors did jointly
but while it is a good enough tale there is one
rather objectionable phase that i feel urged to
call to your attention and that is the geodesic
flyer

   somewhere in the story it is stated that the
geodesic flyer does not travel along a world-line
that of course ia merely a relative term of speech
and means i presume that the ships world-line is
changed from an angle incorporating both space
and time to one which runs parallel to the tiine-
dimension so that the flyer is at rest in space
consequently the flyers motion depends upon
changing its state of inertia that is switching
from a state of motion through space to a posi-
tion of rest all very good-so far but now
come the objections

   firstly in describing how the neptunian left
the earth the authors state that they had hard-
ly begun to feel warm from the friction of the
air when they were out of it let me state
that if the earths atmosphere is say  miles
deep then the geodesic flyer spent five seconds
within it-which is sufficient time to seriously dam-
age the vessel and its occupants for the very
simple reason that the flyer could not leave the
earth at a velocity greater than the planets orbital
speed of  miles per second this can be
readily perceived since the flyer is at rest in
space therefore the flier is not leaving tle earth
but the earth is leaving the flier and the planets
orbital velocity is the figure mentioned were the
ship to depart from the earth at a greater speed
it would have to put on some form of power and
thus travel along a world-line which would again
place it in danger of the meteors which it seeks
to avoid incidentally the fact that the geodesic
flyer is not on a world-line meaning it is not
traveling in space would not save it from
meteors traveling toward that point in space oc-
cupied by the vessel for though the ships path
lies wholly in the fourth dimension meaning it is
traveling in time only the ship itself is in our
familiar three-dimensional euclidean space and
as the world-lincs of the meteors also extend into
time they could intercept the path of the vessel
and cause a collision perhaps my argument is
not very clearly expressed but if you are familiar
with relativity i believe you will easily grasp the
meaning and truth of my statements

     secondlv in order to bring their geodesic
   flyer to a position of rest the travelers would
   first have to apply a force which would hurl the
   ship from the earth with reference to an ob-

server on the planet at a velocity of  miles
per second in a direction opposite to that in which
the planet is traveling this suddenly applied
force would crush the travelers to pulp

   a third objection is the time required to reach
neptune in the story as i recall the time re-
quired for the journey is about  earthly days
as a matter of fact the ship would actually be
 days on the voyage since its maximum
velocity through the solar system is equal to the
speed of the solar system through space-about
 miles per second this of course because the
ship is waiting for the orbit of neptune to catch
up with it and neptunes orbit advances through
space at the above-mentioned rate were the
ship to travel through space at a speed of 
miles per second as stated near the beginning
of the tory it wonld again be oa a world-line
traversing both space and time

  fourthly after reaching neptune the travel-
ers would have to stay on that planet for half a
neptunian year or  terrestrial ones before they
could undertake the voyage back to earth this
because the sun must advance toward neptunes
position in space in order to catch up with the
geodesic flyer

  fifthly the geodesic flyer would never reach
neptune-or any other planet this is because
the orbits of the planets all lie in about the same
plane and the motion of the sun through space
is more vertical to that plane than level with it
hence the geodesic flyer not partaking of the
solar systems motion through space would be left
behind while the sun and all its planets moved
away above it

   the story itself was very entertaining and save
for the above i have no fault to find with it
but to my mind the geodesic flyer represents
the pinnacle of inefficiency and foolhardiness it
were better if scientifiction authors stuck to the
good old rockets and gravity-nullifiers the char-
acters then stand a better chance of getting around
in the universe

  the mathematics in fourth dimensional space
penetrator by julian kendig jr were interes-
ting but sad to relate incorrect or rather
most of them were correct but based upon false
assumptions and therefore leading to false con-
clusions

  but i wont go into that now this letter is
long enough already but before i close i want

  it was said when einsteins first paper came
out and it was a very short one and revolutionary
in its results that there were only twelve people
who could understand it and of these twelve not
one knew who the other eleven were of his re-
cent paper also a very short one it is said of
one eminent scientist that he could understand
the first page but that the rest were beyond him
your letter- however in its criticism of fourth
dimension stories interests us greatly as your
criticisms are based on your knowledge of this
very abstract or it may be called abstruse
question of the einstein theory in other words
we consider your letter a sort of a little story
in itself and we intend that remark distinctly as
a compliment it is interesting to note that so
difficult a subject as the einstein theory has
brought out such an interesting letter as yours
in discussing the artists dont ypu agree with a
big number of ou- readers--and with us-that
there is a marked improvement-editor

  in the latest issue of amazing stories i read
a letter by one who disapproves of the stories about
time machines because h g wells was the first
to write about them on the same general princi-
ple i suppose one should frown on stories of
rockets because undoubtedly wells was one of
the first to utilize a space-rocket in fiction the
martians arrived on earth in the war of the
worlds by being shot at our planet in some such
contrivance jules verne in around the moon
and from the earth to the moon has his daring
voyagers shot from a cannon as a matter of
fact it is foolish to frown on such types of stories
because the point of departure for them has been
used before in literature it is largely recognized
that there are only so many plots in existence and
all stories are rehashings of those basic plots as

 for science fiction one must expect the authors to
 encroach on each others field not of course by
 plagiarizing that is unforgivable but by utiliz-
 ing various mechanisms as their starting point
 into speculation it seems to me that the thing to
 be asked in connection with every story is docs it
 contribute something scientifically new to the va-
 rious theories advanced for after all sciencc
 fiction is supposed to advance our knowledge of
 science and to give us interesting theories and
 speculations based on known facts to marvel and
 think over now i never read one of the stories
 mentioned by the writer of the letter in last issue
 of amazing stories the january issue but the
 master ants by flagg i did read and am at a loss
 to see wherein the author encroached so abominably
 on wells wells story the time machine is an
 entirely different type of story from the master
 ant the only thing in common possessed by
 both stories is the use of a time machine to get
 to the future but it is right here that mr
 flagg introduces some interesting theories in
 relation to time and age not touched on by wells
 time in its relation to space is graphically put
 and age is shown to be engendered by the action
 of environment on the organism in a given
 period of time not by time itself i found this
 theory very interesting and it is a valid one
 based on exact science in connection with certain
 experiments by reputable scientists thus we
 readily see that mr flagg makes a decided con-
 tribution to knowledge in his story the travelers
 age the machine falls to pieces from old age
 wells time machine despite its traveling in
 time for even a million years you will recollect
 that the time traveler went ahead in time until
 the sun shone bleakly and the only sign of life
 was a something on the beach never got out of
 order dr needed repairing mr flagg was astute
 enough not to fall into such an error i am not
 attempting to deny mr wells he is a favorite
 author of mine the credit of being the first in
 this field of fiction but in the name of common-
 sense why bar recent fiction on the same subject
 if it makes interesting contributions not touched
 on before to the general theory of time traveling
 of course mere rehashing with nothing original
 advanced should be frowned on well now that
 is off my chest mr editor let me say that i am
 strong for your splendid magazine some of the
 stories i dont care for but then i realize others
 do so i make no kick my favorite authors to
 date are verrill breuer keller harris flagg
 and wells flagg seems the most worthwhile right
 now to me perhaps as a mathematician his
 speculations appeal more to me i have wondered
 why you printed nothing by him lately hope he
 hasnt deserted your pages for weird tales
 well luck to amazing stories as literature

 some of its stories fall off but as ideas

    we consider that our authors are quite original
 there is a saying that there are only six or seven
 jokes in all this world and that the others are all
 built thereon something of the same sort may be
 taken as applying to stories perhaps there are
 only a few short stories that are really original
 and all others may have followed down the tracks
 started by them but our authors are original
 they do not copy and your criticisms are very
 welcome indeed as vindicating the originality of
 the works which we publish as regards publish-
 ing a story by mr flagg the editors wish you
 could see the pile of material which they have on
 hand and which is so good that they want to
 publish it all but each manuscript must bide its
 time-editor 

the action of a gravity screen
discussed

 editor amazing stories

   there has been considerable discussion in your
 magazine as to whether a gravity screen would
 cause the earth to lose its atmosphere

    in my opinion there are three effects that would
 prevent this from happening

    take a screen as big as the original district of
 columbia  miles square which is larger than
 the area of the ships in the story air up to
 about  miles above it would be fairly well
 screened from the earths gravity this air rises
 when it gets  miles up however it is not
 screened from all the surrounding surface of the
 globe and the enormous weight under it obviously
 it cannot be attracted by matter in the frustro-
 pyramld under the screen there would be a
 change in the isobaric lines over this area but the
 air would not escape

   suppose the screen was as big as the state of
 pennsylvania this would allow the air to rise
 much higher the air as it starts to rise has the

 earths rotation and planetary velocity as it
 rises it cannot gain more clocity but as it gains
 in distance it will have to have a higher velocity to
 stay in the same radial line instead the deserting
 air column would pass westward and once clear of
 the screen would be pulled down by gravity again

    then if prof olsen is right in saying grav-
 ity is an electromagnetic wave it would close
 again behind the screen as all waves do

   what effect would wave length have on this
 theory 

    for interstellar rockets some means of locating
 and avoiding small dark bodies in space would be
 necessary when the mars express leaves man-
 hattan transfer far behind and begins to get up
 the terrific bullet velocity necessary to make the
 -mile trip in a month it would spell
 disaster if even a small slow-moving rock got in
 its way a meteorite would be forced by its inertia
 to go from one end to the other leaving several
 sizable holes at least

    most meteorites arc composed of iron and nickel
 both magnetic metals so some loeater using mag-
 netic or electrical means could spot them out a
 delicate radio circuit might locate them by their
 capacity and its effect on the circuit

    space is fairly empty but it would only take one
 collision to stop the rocket your magazine is o k

         s p khotimlansky washington d c

   we agree with you that if a space ship en-
 countered a meteor while it was going at the speed
 which we have to assume that such a vessel would
 have the consequences would be very sad it would
 be like stevensons cow on the railroad track he
 was asked in the early days of railroading what
 would happen if a cow got on the track in front of
 the engine whereupon he said it would be very
 bad for the cow the fact that meteorites are so
 often metallic in nature and the other fact of the
 specific gravity of the earth being so high lead to
 a probability that the center of the earth is largely
 metallic iron and nickel so that the earth repre-
 sents in a sense a great meteorite with a thin crust
 covering it-editor

the gravity screen again

 editor amazing stories

    although i have been a consistent reader of
 your publications since the days of the electrical
 experimenter i have never written you of late
 years there are but few magazines that i find
 time to read but i have not missed an issue of
 amazing stories since it was first placed on
 the newsstands and i hope to enjoy it for many
 years to come i will not attempt to name the
 authors or stories that i like best as it would
 consume too much space but i am glad you have
 stopped giving so much space to reprints especially
 such stories as those of jules verne who although
 a great author is now decidedly out of date

    now just a word in criticism of capt s p
  meeks story in the september issue he states

 -if a gravity screen were perfected-such a

  screen would rapidly exhaust all atmosphere from
  the earth while it is true that a terrific up-
  draft of air would be created as the screen rose it
  would spread due to less pressure on the sides
  also the screen unless covering thousands of
  miles of space would not screen gravity to any
  groat distance above it on account of the pull of
  the earth to either side of the screen

                       c a showman

                    page ave harvey 
  by inserting your very interesting letter in the
  discussions column we think that we will bring
  it to the attention of captain meek as we figure
  it a gravity screen rising might have the effect
  of producing a sort of vacuum beneath it which
  would in that case hold the air and not permit it
  to escape the air rushing in to fill up the vacuous
  space generated by the motion of the screen through
  the atmosphere but the whole thing is largely a
  phantasy because it still seems very doubtful if a
  real gravity screen in the true sense of the word
  will ever be evolved by mankind-editor

 amazing stories most of them are from long
 ago here they arc the moon pool the
 land that time forgot the second deluge
 the master mind of mars the nth man
 the skylark of space and the vanguard of
 venus all these stories had a scientific back-
 ground a word about this scientific background

    during the last few months amazing stories
 has been degenerating into a magazine with a
 scientific foreground and a fiction background

    david keller md appeals to me particularly
  although his stories arc not of the action variety
  i did not mention any of kellers works in the list
  i gave because they make up a list by themselves

    wesso is as good a substitute for paul as one
  might wish most of his drawings are on a par
  with those of paul tell wesso to keep up the
  good work

    if i sec any of merritt cummings or burroughs
  in the forthcoming issues i will take it as a
  personal favor to me and my friends

    amazing stories is supposed to be a maga-
 zine of scientific foreground and it is supposed to
 contain fiction stories with scientific backgrounds
 so what is there to complain about in that regard
 dr keller is a very fine writer and he has the
 art of bringing a strong human element into the
 stories and with it a touch of humor which is
 very advantageous and which gives them the
 real interest and grip upon the heart of the
 readers we are sure you are going to hke our
 art work after this we have several excellent
 artists and everyone must agree that the figures-
 the pictures of the charactcrs when shown in these
 drawings-are superior to any that were given
 in the earlier issues of amazing stories part
 of our work-and a very important part-has been
 by trial and sad experience to find really adequate
 artists to illustrate the text of the magazine-
 editor

a devoted young reader gives
his views

 editor amazing stories

    i have long wanted to write to you but have
  not been able to write until now i have been
  reading your amazing stories since i was 
  years old and am now  years and have found
  this magazine the best in scientifiction in illus-
  trations and in poetry i have written to you
  today to tell you the kinds of stories authors
  and illustrations i like first of all i like a
  hyatt verrill david h keller and harl vincent
  best of all for their stories which combine every-
  thing-mystery romance and thrills action and
  adventure the stories i have liked best so far
  are into the green prism and its sequel be-
  yond the green prism which has just started
  the secret kingdom was good but not as
  good as the skylark of space which i have
  read four times since it was published memos
  by henry janies also was a good story now
  that i have told you some of the stories i have
  liked i will tell you some of the stories i have
  hated the revolt of the pedestrians was
  good but it could never happen some people
  might lose the use of their legs but not all the
  world

    in the illustration there are hardly any auto-
  mobiles on the street and if you say that the
  automobiles are on the lower level how could
  the people have gotten out of their cars and
  walked up to the higher level when they did not
  have any legs this shows the story to be im-
  possible

    the letter of the twenty-fourth century should
  never have been published as it is not an amazing
  story at all but a plain letter which describes
  nothing that will happen but rather describes
  topics that we have right now such as the radio
  the telephone the airplane and so forth now
  as to the illustrations i think that paul and wesso
  ought to combinc on each picture as one has got
  the qualities that the other hasnt as i havent
  any more time i am closing my letter

 we arc always delighted to get letters from
 our younger readers although one of the attributes
 of youth is to criticize very severely ones views
 get softened by the passage of years but in this
 letter our correspondent treats us rather well
 as regards combining artists our experience is
 that they are rather a sensitive set of human beings
 and would resist any such combination as you
 suggest in conclusion as you have been reading
 amazing stories since you were ten years old
 and like it so much we hope that you will stay with

the correct definition of
time-traveling

editor amazing stories

   i am writing to the discussions in order to dis
cuss with you the probability of time-traveling

  it has been done it is being done we are
traveling into the future at every second but
real time-traveling is to either go backwards not
forward in time or to accelerate our rate of
traveling forward

  both of these have been done heres how if
you were to go on a ship and travel to europe
you would gain a few hours travelers to europe
have to turn their watches ahead about five hours
for the ocean trip-actual proof that they have
gained a few hours if you were to go around the
world from west to cast you would gain a day
jules vernes book around the world in eighty
days

  if you were to go around the world from east
to west you would lose a day but how could this
be possible if all the while you are traveling for-
ward in time in order to lose a day you would
have to travel backwards in time not forward as
we are constantly doing simply it cannot be
passible to travel both bachvards and forwards
at the same time along time yet the fact re-
mains that it may be possible to do so but how
isnt there an explanation for this apparently
not

   let us assume that time is the fourth dimension
as many of your writers have it if we travel in
time either backwards or forwards we are still
traveling in three dimensions therefore the
fourth dimension is contained in the three dimen
sions but if that is so then three dimensions are
contained in two i and two in onel and one
in--what nothing  impossibilities but any-
way something of this is true the first part at
least and how do you explain that

in closing i will say that the best fourth-
dimensional story i ever read is paradox by

clukcj-	m miller

s southern blvd bronx n y

  owing to the difference of time if you go
around the world in one direction you are said to
lose a day or in another direction to gain a day
this merely means that the day in one direction
of travel is shorter than the true day shorter than
when we travel in the other direction and vice
versa there is  real gain or loss cxcept in
this numerical number of days a good illustra-
tion is that if you go across the ocean in a modern
high sliced steamship in one direction-going
east-each day is about  hours in length
coming in the other direction-to the west-each
day is about  hours in length but tht merely
refers to the alternation of light and darkness of
sunlight and night your watch will show the
same number of hours edgar a poe has written
a very amusing story on this theory based on
three wednesdays in a week you will find a
story elaborating this theme in a somewhat early
number of amazing stories-editor

editor amazing stories

  i would like to say a little about what i have
read in the december issue of amazing stories
when i finished reading the twenty-first
century limited i considered it one of the best
interplanetary stories i have read for some time
i had the feeling that i was a person living in
 and reading it as a present day fiction story

   i also read the last installment of the secret
kingdom but consider it out of place in amazing
stories it was a good story in its place and held
interest to the last

  lets have paul slaekta write a sequel to his
story about the proposed trip to mar with rayaud
dana and have it just as interesting

  ps-by all means keep wesso and morey as
illustrators	junior harbaugh

                     virginia avenue
                        hagerstown maryland

  there certainly was a great deal of vigor and
life in the story the st century limited and
we shall hope to get more perhaps equally good
stories from the same author you will find that
much of our art work is being done by wesso and
morey and these we consider exceptionally good
artists and their figure work the presentation of
the characters of the story so far has been par-
ticularly good we can assure you that the editors
are the severest critics that our artists have and
we can only say that they stand our scolding
rather well-editor

suggestions for a story supposed
to be told by a saturnian

editor amazing stories

   permit me to say that the january number is as
good as any two previous which i have read
when the atoms failed was especially good as
was the second on the list i enclose

   the addenda of the second story however
were better omitted it is accurate enough to
make trouble for the policc who have too much
as is the story as a story was good however

  in campbells story there was one rather
comical slip that did not show up until my
fourth reading if watersons terrestrian
could reflect heat rays how was the sun able to
overheat it heat alone being considered this
docs not injure the story in my estimation

  some may consider the super-integraph of
this story impossible personally i do not be-
cause tho aquawky talkies and radio television
much less possible even from a spencerian science
viewpoint and wholly so from a mechanist-de-
terminlst viewpoint are yet accomplished facts
this conceded bartholomew at once is included
in the possibilities of science with all the powers
attributed in the story and the man who builds
and uses the super-integraph is the destined
arbiter of earth willingly or no

   why not get someone to write a tale of electro-
mechanical astro-projection-a perfectly possible
thing also a story by let us say a saturnian
relating the first visit by terrestrians the non-
human viewpoint might be a difficulty however

   it is very hard for the editors who do so
much work on each issie of the magazine to
state definitely that they consider one number far
superior to the other comments of the nature
oi the one you give are not only agreeable-per-
haps a little too flattering-but they aro instructive
it is essential to get the opinion of outsiders on a
magazine all we can do is to pick out good
stories and try to give them in an intelligent way
so as to avoid repetition of the same topic in the
same issue and to get a proper distribution of length
of stories that is to say to give a proper number
of stories in each issue your suggestion about
saturn is a very good one just imagine what
that planet would supply in the way of a view of
the sky with the great rings surrounding it at so
short a distance from its surface like a multitude
of moons saturn is so large and the rings are
so close that their velocity of rotation is very
high and the prospect it would afford would seem
to be very superb we especially like criticisms
from our young readers-editor

a friendly letter from
a young reader

editor amazing stories

   although this is my first attempt at writing you
i feel free to express my opinion of your stories
and the letters criticizing them also

   your magazine taken as a whole is the best on
the stands today without exception i have been
reading it since i first saw it about two and a half
years ago the interplanetary stories are wonder-
ful and i look for them in every issue lets have
some more like the skylark of space the
fourth dimensional stories are next microcosmic
buccaneers being especially good among the
other stories high in my estimation are the di-
mension segregator the last man futil-
ity armageddon- and its sequel airloads
of han the superperfect bride and the
purple death

   and now the criticism of your criticizers first
there are no perfect humans we have to allow
for certain mistakes of our authors and try to
profit by them

   second if there were no so-called impossibilities
in the stories would they be nearly so interesting 
the things that are now considered impossible will
probably be common events a few years in the
future twenty-five years ago it was considered
impossible for a man to fly in a heavier-than-air
machine

   in reference to propulsion by rockets in inter-
planetary travel supposing that a rockets
motor would not propel an air vessel through a
vacuum have we proof that space outside of the
atmosphere of the earth is a vacuum scientists
call it ether because they do not know what it
is correct me if i am wrong in this state-
ment most people consider space a vacuum for
the same reason they do not know what it is

  in the november issue which i have just
finished ronald scribners letter gives me a good
deal to think about in one place he says if we
were to travel faster than the speed of light that

 we would eventually see the battle of waterloo re-
 enacted but in the reverse order would you
 mind explaining that statement ronald

    i have enjoyed this issue of your magazine more
 than any issue in a long time i am  years old
 and am in high school where i took a course in
 physics last year it has changed my views of
 science very much in closing i will say that
 amazing stories is the magazine for people who
 in any way are interested in science it imparts
 a greater understanding of science and gives a
 broad field to the imagination these people who
 arc always finding some little point wrong in the
 stories-why dont they quit complaining and let
 the rest of us enjoy the magazine

                       c l granger jr

        commonwealth ave charlotte n c

    with reference to your opening statement we
 hope that your first attempt at writing to us will
 not be your last you will not find many mistakes
 in our magazines they are watched for most
 carefully but as you say or imply none of us are
 perfect so there are bound to be some errors
 seeming impossibilities are perfectly in place in
 the stories they certainly will make them inter-
 esting and as you say impossibilities become possi-
 bilities in the development of human science and
 intelligence not only would a rocket propel an
 air vessel through a vacuum but the action of the
 rocket would be far better in a vacuum than in the
 air once the rocket got the airship going and
 lifted it out of the earth atmosphere into the
 vacuum of space a minimum effort or very slight
 action would be required to keep it traveling in-
 definitely except for gravitation because in the
 absence of air there would be nothing to stop it
 from going the battle of waterloo in a sense
 might be assumed to be visible if one could travel
 through space fast enough to catch up with the
 rays of light which left it in  over a hundred
 years ago but owing to the distance which they
 would travel these rays of light would diminish so
 in intensity that it is probable if we did the al-
 most absurd act of catching up with them that
 they would be too weak to affect the human eye

 tion for what we are doing-editor
